The sketch is credited with creating the popular stereotype of accountants being boring. reprinted in Four decades on, the Financial Times reported that it still haunts the profession.Learn the elementary bits about business, Financial Times, 14 October 2008 Plot Herbert Anchovy (Michael Palin) goes to the counsellor (John Cleese) seeking a career change. The counsellor reveals that Anchovy had done an aptitude test, and that the results showed that the career Anchovy is most suited to is chartered accountancy. Anchovy protests that he already is a chartered accountant, and complains that he finds the job dull. The counsellor says that, according to the aptitude test, Anchovy is an extremely dull person; while that would be a drawback in other professions, the counsellor says, it makes him even more suitable for accountancy. Anchovy reveals that his dream is to be a lion tamer, saying that his qualifications for the job are having seen them at the zoo, and having his own lion taming hat. However, it turns out that he has misidentified an anteater as a lion. The counsellor disabuses Anchovy by telling him how fierce lions really are, and shows him a picture of one, which frightens him. Anchovy then comes up with the idea of working his way towards lion taming via banking, but soon reveals that he lacks the courage even for that. As he rambles on, the counsellor delivers a public service announcement about the dangers of chartered accountancy. Re- release The sketch was included in the DVD Monty Python's Flying Circus: Set One‚ÄîVolume 1, as well as in Monty Python's Flying Circus: Graham Chapman's Personal Best, and also appeared in And Now For Something Completely Different in 1971. In this version the counsellor's description of lions is accompanied by stock footage of a lion charging the camera, which causes Anchovy to recoil in terror. At the end of the film version Eric Idle appears as a fairy to grant Anchovy's wish of seeing his name in lights, whereupon he turns into the host of \\"Blackmail\\". In the Monty Python Live (Mostly) stage show at the O2 (which also features a brief stock shot of a lion, on the overhead screen), the sketch ends with Anchovy telling the counsellor he would rather be... a \\"systems analyst!\\" (though on a different evening, his choice of career was a \\"sperm donor!\\". Other careers were mentioned on other nights at the O2). In fact this was a red herring as in all instances, the audience were expecting Anchovy to say \\"lumberjack\\"...then as Palin (as Anchovy) leaps to his feet he announces he wanted to be... \\"a lumberjack!\\", at which point he strips off his suit to reveal a lumberjack's outfit, and the sketch segues into The Lumberjack Song.

(FSML) is a kind of domain-specific modeling language which is designed for an object-oriented application framework. FSMLs define framework-provided abstractions as FSML concepts and decompose the abstractions into features. The features represent implementation steps or choices. A FSML concept can be configured by selecting features and providing values for features. Such a concept configuration represents how the concept should be implemented in the code. In other words, concept configuration describes how the framework should be completed in order to create the implementation of the concept. Applications FSMLs are used in model-driven development for creating models or specifications of software to be built. FSMLs enable * the creation of the models from the framework completion code (that is, automated reverse engineering) * the creation of the framework completion code from the models (that is, automated forward engineering) * code verification through constraint checking on the model * automated round-trip engineering Examples Eclipse Workbench Part Interaction FSML M.

E. oxypetalum rarely blooms and only at night, and its flowers wilt before dawn. Though it is sometimes referred to as a night-blooming cereus, it is not closely related to any of the species in the tribe Cereeae, such as Selenicereus, that are more commonly known as nightblooming cereus.

Name  Epiphyllum from Greek epi- \\"upon\\" + phullon \\"leaf\\" Oxypetalum = with acute petals = Vernacular names = In India, E. oxypetalum is called Iruludavare (‡≤á‡≤∞‡≥Å‡≤≥‡≥Å‡≤¶‡≤æ‡≤µ‡≤∞‡≥Ü) in Kannada, meaning 'night lotus'. It is believed that the wishes of people who pray to God while the flower is blooming will be fulfilled. It is also called as \\"Bramhakamal\\" in Maharashtra.

It is called Kadupul flower in Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka‚Äôs native blossom) The Chinese chengyu (four character idiom) ÊõáËä±‰∏ÄÁèæ (t√°n huƒÅ yƒ´ xi√†n) use this flower (tan-hua; ÊõáËä±) to describe someone who has an impressive but very brief moment of glory, like a \\"flash in a pan,\\" since an Epiphyllum oxypetalum plant might bloom only once a year over a few days. Therefore, someone described as \\"ÊõáËä±‰∏ÄÁèæ\\" is generally understood to be a person who shows off or unexpectedly gains some achievement and is thought to be an exception or only lucky.

In 1909, C. A. Purpus collected a slightly different type in St. Ana, Orizaba, Mexico. It has carmine red outer petals and the flowers have an unpleasant smell, rather than being fragrant. It was originally named Phyllocactus purpusii, but is now included within this species.  Description  The side view of an open Epiphyllum oxypetalum flower Stems are erect, ascending, scandent, or sprawling and profusely branched. Primary stems are terete, up through long, flattened laterally, and ligneous at their bases. Secondary stems are flat, elliptic-acuminate, up through 30 cm x 10‚Äì12 cm. Stem margins are shallowly through deeply crenate and undulate. Stems appear to be waxy therefore cutin may be present. Cutin reduces water loss from stems. A gel-like substance oozes out of stem cuts. Stems contain much water-filled tissue. =Flower and fruit= Flowers grow on flattened stems and are up through 30 cm long and 17 cm wide, nocturnal, and very fragrant. The principal odor component in the aroma is benzyl salicylate. Pericarpels are nude, slightly angled, and green. Bracteoles are short and narrow up through ca. long. Receptacles are up through 20 cm long, 1 cm thick, brownish, and arching. Outer tepals are linear, acute, 8‚Äì10 cm long, and reddish through amber. Inner tepals are whitish, oblanceolate through oblong, acuminate, up through 8‚Äì10 cm long and wide. Stamens are greenish white or white, slender and weak. Styles are greenish white, pale yellow, or white, 4 mm thick, as long as inner tepals, and with many lobes. Fruit are oblong, up through 12 x 8 cm, purplish red, and angled.

Range  Epiphyllum oxypetalum is native to Southern Mexico and to extensive areas of South America. It is widely cultivated, escapes from cultivation in tropical areas especially in the southeast Asia, and has become naturalised in China.  Cultivation/Uses  Epiphyllum oxypetalum is an easily cultivated, fast growing Epiphyllum. It flowers in late spring through late summer; large specimens can produce several crops of flowers in one season. This is a commonly grown Epiphyllum species.

It is situated two miles southwest of Clitheroe proper. It is significant for being a well documented mill village. History In the nineteenth century, the hamlet was home to Low Moor Mill, \\"a most extensive cotton manufacture, with power looms, put in motion by an immense body of machinery\\".\\"Low Moor\\", in Stephen Reynolds Clarke, The New Lancashire Gazetteer (London, 1830), pp. 101-102.

Rose, Limited Livelihoods: Gender and Class in Nineteenth Century England (London, 1992), passim. This cotton mill, taken over by Jeremiah Garnett and Timothy Horsfall in 1799, closed in 1930 and was demolished. The workers' cottages survived. Two diaries of historical interest survive, one written by the weaver John O'Neill, and one by a co owner of the factory, James Garnett.Owen Ashmore, Industrial Archaeology of North-west England (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 197-198. Low Moor Mill William Garnett, of Thomas Garnett and sons The first mill, a five storey spinning mill, opened in 1782. The owners built cottages for the workers in the spirit of the mill towns of the following century. The mill and 28 workers cottage were sold to Parker and Parker in 1791, and then in 1799, to Jeremiah Garnett and Timothy Horsfall. The mill was demolished, replaced and extended. The 1824 mill was powered by three iron waterwheels running on mill race from a weir built on the River Ribble. Three beam engines were added by 1858. Weaving sheds were built in the 1850s and 1860s. The 1840 mill was powered by 3 iron waterwheels on a leet from the River Ribble, supplemented by beam engines. The waterwheels were replaced in the late nineteenth century by turbines, and the beam engines were upgraded to a 1250 IHP vertical steam engine in 1893/4. Garnett's mill closed in 1930. The buildings have been demolished and replaced by housing. =Housing= Parker and Garnett developed the housing. There were 262 houses with 1057 inhabitants in the 1861 census. Some of these were back to back in design, and at a later stage these were 'knocked through' to provide 'through houses' with a yard and privy, to comply with the standards laid down in the 1875 Public Health Act. Thus, in 1928 when the mill closed, there were 200 houses, nine shops, a National school, church and two Methodist chapels. Social amenities Low Moor has a local club called the Low Moor Reading Room and Club with two snooker tables, one pool table, one dartboard, and a few slot machines. Some of the residents of Clitheroe and Low Moor come here to socialize. Professional UFC Fighter Michael Bisping grew up in this part of town. There is also a nursery situated in the area named St Paul's Nursery as well as St Paul's Church. Low Moor Croquet Club is also a place of interest which is run by Low Moor Residents Luke Chatburn and Adam Warriner. A Spar Store has been built within the area for local residents.

Paper was used to make money, Buddhist texts, and medical and history books. The government encouraged dak cultivation and paper production, and dak was planted countrywide in the 12th century. Often called Goryeoji, hanji became famous in Asia for its strength and luster, and became a heavy trade item to China. The Goryeo period is famous for two major landmarks in Korean printmaking and paper history. One was the carving of the Tripitaka Koreana onto over 80,000 wooden blocks, which contain no errors and are still extant in their original home at Haeinsa, a Buddhist temple in Gyeongsangnam-do. It was carved twice, due to its destruction by Mongol invasions in 1232; the final version was completed in 1251. The second accomplishment was the printing in 1377 of Jikji, a guide for students of Buddhism, and the world's oldest extant book printed using metal movable type. Printed onto hanji, it is housed today in the National Library of France, and displays proof of movable metal type well before Gutenberg's time. =Joseon period= The beginning of the Joseon period (1392‚Äì1910) saw continued flourishing of the hanji industry as paper permeated daily lives of Koreans through books, household items, and popular items such as fans and tobacco pouches. From the start of the Joseon period in an effort to promote austerity, artificial flowers that had been made from wax and silk were replaced by paper versions. Later, paper flowers were also used to replace other versions for Buddhist rites and festivals. Variations of hanji became common, such as colored paper, and paper made from mixed fibers including pine bark, rice straw, and bamboo. This came partly from a need to find new materials beyond dak due to the huge demand for books. The government created an administrative agency devoted to paper production, and also supplied troops with paper armor, which was waterproof, a good insulator, and provided protection against arrows and swords. Oiled hanji was used to make greenhouses c. 1450 because the paper, made of natural materials, could control temperature, humidity, and light effectively. However, the Joseon government pressured Buddhist monks to increase their production of hanji that they were already making for Buddhist scriptures since the 15th century. As the final blow to hanji, western methods of paper mass production were introduced in 1884. =After liberation= In the 1970s, the New Village Movement that aimed to modernize Korea rapidly also led to further decimation of the hanji industry, as it eradicated traditional straw-thatched homes that used hanji to cover floors, walls, ceilings, windows, and doors. The most recent threat to the Korean paper industry is the rise of inexpensive paper made in China, where labor costs and overhead are significantly lower than in Korea. As of 2009, twenty-six hanji mills remain operational in South Korea. They make hanji for artists, calligraphers, conservators, temples, and laypeople.Lee, Aimee. ‚ÄúBuddhist Illumination of Korean Papermaking‚Äôs Past and Present‚Äù, Buddhism and Culture Magazine, No. 5, April 2010.Amlie, Lynn. \\"Hanji: Korea's Traditional Paper\\", Hand Papermaking, Vol. 11, No. 2, Winter 1996.Field, Dorothy.

Manufacturing Process = Materials = The two materials mainly used when making Hanji is the paper mulberry (called the Dak tree) and the aibika. More than 6 steps of the manufacturing process deal with mending and preparing these two materials (Seo). The paper mulberry is a commonly grown plant in Asia, growing in the feet of mountains that gets a lot of sunlight, reaching a growth height of usually 3 meters. In Korean history, people used the fibers from these trees to make clothes, and they began to use it as the source for paper during the Goryeo dynasty. The Joseon dynasty, which came after Goryeo, recommended people to grow more of these mulberry trees. The aibika usually finishes growing in October. Their roots contain a slimy mucus (called Dak Pul) which helps hold the paper together and give viscosity to the bark. = Process = Ancient Koreans usually started making Hanji during the winter, because the mucus from Abelmoschus manihot became easily fermented due to the summer heat. Ancient Koreans believed that it was important to choose a good day with a nice sky to start making Hanji, and often gave religious rituals to the spirits in order to wish for a favorable condition and a smooth process. The process of making Hanji differs by what ingredients the Hanji makers choose, and what methods of sheet formation they take to make the final product. However, the most traditional and basic process follows eight steps: #Hanji makers gather clean and strong barks of mulberry trees. #The bark is skinned and dried. The result is called Heukpi (ÌùëÌîº, hanja: ÈªëÁöÆ). The Heukpi is kept in flowing water for at least 10 hours. This eases the process of skinning the bark, turning Heukpi into Baekpi (Î∞±Ìîº, hanja: ÁôΩÁöÆ). #Bean or buckwheat stems are burned, and their ashes are put into water to boil the Baekpi for 4‚Äì5 hours. #The Baekpi is washed, removing any remaining bark and soil. #The skinned and cleaned Baekpi is placed on a flat stone board and pounded (Gohae) for about an hour. #The mucus from Abelmoschus manihot (Dakpul) is applied onto the bark. This helps the paper stay together for a long time, and does not contain any harmful chemicals. #Sheets of the mixture are formed next, while pouring more Dakpul onto the sheet. It is stirred with a long and wooden stick, and they call this Puldaejil. The final substance is put on a flat bamboo outline, where the surface is made smooth and even. This process is where the skill of the craftsman is truly revealed, as it requires years of experience and practice to achieve good Hanji, determining the thickness, texture, and overall quality of Hanji. Many methods of this procedure exist, including Hullim, Gadum, Webal, and Jangpan, each producing slightly different types of Hanji. Traditional methods of sheet forming is different from the modern day method, which use machinery to make it even. #One single sheet of Hanji is now made, which is pressed between heavy stones to dry, and placed in a warm room. They do not dry them near fire, because gradually drying them with a warm temperature causes the paper to be more tough and durable. The overall process of making Hanji was very strenuous. One had to dedicate all of his or her life to making Hanji, and traditional Hanji makers would say ‚ÄúI will not let my son be a container man (the person who strains the fiber through a bamboo screen) even if I am driven to the worst‚Äù.The Story It requires a lifelong practice to create perfect Hanji, and this is the reason why Hanji holds a great cultural value in Korea. These days, people use various technology to improve the process. For example, the Hanji makers use a heated stainless steel drum, brushing every part of the paper. This is the method that they take to dry the papers evenly, which is adapted from how traditional Hanji makers dried them on the floor of a warm room.Song and Munn  Characteristics of Hanji  = Durability = Hanji is a very reputable paper among Asians, and it is famous for its durability. The fact that other historical print papers have to be preserved in special containers when Hanji papers can still be displayed in museums proves this fact. The oldest text made of Hanji currently existing in Korea, Muggujungwang, is still well preserved after about 800 years (Seo). = Ventilation/Temperature Control = Hanji is a good ventilator, but it also keeps the temperature of the room warm. Traditional Koreans covered their wooden doors with Hanji because it would cool down in the summer and make them warm during winter (Hanji's History). = Waterproof = In March 2006, there was a lamp festival in Paris, France. Many sizes and colors of lamps were lighted in the Boulogne park. Soon after the festival started, there was a sudden rain, and people panicked. They were worried that all the lamps would turn off. However, lamps made out of traditional Hanji did not turn off. It did not let the rain through, protecting candle lights within, and it portrayed one of the many advantages of Hanji (Seo). [PROPER CITATIONS NEEDED] = Scientific Principles = The bark from mulberry trees contain lignin and holocellulose, which contribute to the durability of Hanji. Ordinary paper has a pH level of 4~5.5, meaning that it is acidic. If paper has a low pH level (more acidic), it is completely decomposed in 100 years. Hanji, however, uses Hibiscus Manihot, which has a pH level of 7 and does not get dismantled easily (‚ÄúThe Significance‚Äù).  Use of Hanji  = Ancient Uses = Ever since paper was first introduced to the commoners in ancient Koreans, its uses have been adapted into various and unique ways. Hanji was used to help people in the daily lives. They covered their door frame with Hanji and controlled the room temperature. The high social class people, called Yangbans, recorded various documents on Hanji. This is one of the main reasons why Korea's ancient records are well preserved. China's Dynasty also only used Hanji to record their emperor's achievements. It was one of the main export products that Korean dynasties used in trading (Seo). Another unique usage of Hanji is that people made armors out of Hanji. Even though Hanji is just a paper, it was very durable and tough. It was waterproof, and didn't rip easily. There is a record in Korea saying that people made armors and suits with Hanji, and called them Jigap (‚ÄúJigap‚Äù). = Hanji art and craft forms = There are two divisions of hanji art: two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Two-dimensional hanji art uses paper of various colors to create an image in a similar format as a painting. However, the paper itself is folded and crumpled to make the image stick up from the paper it is adhered to. People make various shapes with Hanji and frame it to exhibit on their wall. Three-dimensional hanji art is similar to paper mache, in that it can make sculptural objects that may stand unsupported. Traditional hanji craft forms include jiho, jido, and jiseung. Jiho is a method that uses hanji scraps soaked in water and then added to glue, making a clay-like paste that can be molded into lidded bowls. Jido is the craft of pasting many layers of hanji onto a pre-made frame, which can be made into sewing baskets and trunks. Ancient Koreans commonly put their sewing materials in small boxes decorated with colorful Hanji (‚ÄúHanji Crafting‚Äù). Jiseung is a method of cording and weaving strips of hanji to make a wide array of household goods, including trays, baskets, mats, quivers, shoes, washbasins, and chamberpots. Other than these, Hanji was made into various flowers to decorate Buddhist temples (‚ÄúHanji Crafting‚Äù).

Biography Khawaja Sultan Ul Arifeen Sayyid Sabir Pak Ali Ahmed was the great grandson of Peer Ghous Ul Azam Sayyid Abdul Qadir Jilani. His father was Sayyid Abdus Salaam Abdur Rahim Jilani, son of Sayyid Abdul Wahaab Jilani, eldest son of Sayyid Abdul Qadir Jilani. His mother was Sayyidah Jamilah, elder sister of Baba Farid Ganjshakkar and direct descendant of Umar Al Faruq. Baba Fareed entrusted him the duty of distribution of food (Langar). He accepted this duty happily and in between engaged himself in prayers. He dispensed with his duties well and also attended the discourse of Baba Freed Ganje Shakar. He did not partake a single morsel from food (langer), kept fasts and went to the jungle and ate wild berries and leaves. He did his duties for 12 years. He prayed continuously and his abstentions were never disrupted. Frequent and continuous fasting and eating leaves and wild food made him weak. When his mother came back again and saw him, she complained to his brother (Baba Fareed) of his weakness. Baba Fareed called upon him and asked the reason. Sabir Pak replied ‚ÄúYou ordered me to distribute the food and not to partake from it‚Äù. Baba Fareed embraced him happily and remarked ‚ÄúHe is sabir (Patient)‚Äù. From that day forth He became famous with the name of ‚ÄúSabir‚Äù.

A version of the song was recorded by Whispering Jack Smith (noted for his soft, \\"whispered\\" delivery over the air waves); his recording became one of the most popular. It has been covered by a full range of artists from mainstream jazz to hillbilly bebop. At least 150 covers have been recorded by Harry James, Shirley Bassey, The King Cole Trio, Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys, Chet Atkins, Bix Beiderbecke, Ben Bernie, Miles Davis, Stan Getz, Erroll Garner, Stephane Grappelli, Lionel Hampton, Woody Herman, Herman's Norwegian Jazz Group Soloist: Ragnar Robertsen (Recorded on October 27, 1954 and re-released on the extended play Odeon GEON 2), Mark Murphy, Les Paul, Hank Penny, Django Reinhardt, Nellie McKay, Bing Crosby, and Frank Sinatra have all recorded this catchy tune. Most, but not all, are strictly instrumental. Of special note is the performance by Doris Day and Gene Nelson in the 1950 film Tea for Two. This is a frame tale based on a putative production of No, No, Nanette (written in 1925 by the prolific Caesar, Otto Harbach, and Vincent Youmans); \\"Tea for Two\\" being a number inserted into the original Nanette. \\"Crazy Rhythm\\" is presented in this film as a demonstration for backers of the production-to-be. Thus, it has come to be associated with the popular \\"Tea\\" and Nanette, while Here's Howe is largely forgotten. Day and Nelson also recorded \\"Crazy Rhythm\\" on the album Tea for Two‚Äînot a soundtrack but a distinct studio recording in which Nelson does a tap solo, not seen or heard on film.Tea for Two at Tap Wonderland Bing Crosby recorded the song in 1956 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56) issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009. Tony Bennett recorded the song for his 1957 album The Beat of My Heart. This notable recording is included on many of his (jazz) hit compilations. Crazy Rhythm was frequently used as the closing music for BBC's humorous The Goon Show, performed live by Max Geldray or Ray Ellington, and is commonly associated with the show. Another notable recording of the song is on 1961's Further Definitions, by Benny Carter with Coleman Hawkins. This is one of Carter's most acclaimed recordings.Carter, Benny at Encyclop√¶dia Britannica OnlineDiamond Jubilee of Jazz at American Heritage Encounters of Every Kind is an album by Meco, released in 1978. It was recorded after the success of Meco's platinum-selling album Star Wars and Other Galactic Funk, and in a similar fashion to that album, contained disco- styled interpretations of the original score from the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. On side B the first song is a cheerful rendition of \\"Crazy Rhythm\\", with gunshots in stereo and the lyrics with music in slow transition to the Meco's funk-jazz style. \\"Crazy Rhythm\\" is, for the working jazz musician, inescapable.

They are used on some small vehicles such as riding lawn mowers and motorized golf carts. They are also used on heavy equipment such as backhoes, which are required to operate on sites such as building demolition, where risk of tire punctures is high. Tires composed of closed-cell polyurethane foam are also made for bicycles and wheelchairs. They are also commonly found on wheelbarrows which may be used for yard work or construction. Advantages The main advantage of airless tires is that they do not go flat. Other advantages are that airless tires need to be replaced less, resulting in savings. Heavy equipment outfitted with airless tires will be able to carry more weight and engage in more rugged activities.  Disadvantages  Airless tires generally have higher rolling resistance and provide somewhat less suspension than similarly shaped and sized pneumatic tires. Other problems for airless heavy equipment tires include dissipating the heat buildup that occurs when they are driven. Airless tires are often filled with compressed polymers (plastic), rather than air or can be a solid molded product. Airless tires are attractive to cyclists, as bicycle tires are much more vulnerable to punctures than motor vehicle tires. The drawbacks to airless tires depend on the use. Heavy equipment operators who use machinery with solid tires will complain of fatigue whereas lawn mowers that use solid or airless tires have no drawbacks. Bicycle riders who use airless tires may complain that the tire is harder than a comparable pneumatic tire. Only anecdotal evidence exists that airless tires may cause broken spokes on a bicycle wheel. Any airless tire will be heavier than the rubber tire it is meant to replace; however, many rubber pneumatic tires are also heavy. Rubber tires vary in rolling resistance and an airless tire or solid insert may only marginally increase rolling resistance, if at all. Installation of airless tires depends on the use. Heavy equipment will need special equipment to mount, but an airless bicycle tire can be mounted with little or no effort. Solid airless lawnmower tires come pre-installed on the wheel, allowing quick installation. Examples An Airless tire fitted on a Mobike Many bicycle-sharing systems use these tires to reduce maintenance. In 2005, Michelin started developing an integrated tire and wheel combination, the \\"Tweel\\" (derived from \\"tire\\" and \\"wheel,\\" which, as the name \\"Tweel\\" suggests, are combined into one new, fused part), which operates entirely without air. Michelin claims its \\"Tweel\\" has load carrying, shock absorbing, and handling characteristics that compare favorably to conventional pneumatic tires. However, the tire has a lot of vibration when driving over . Therefore the tire is only available for golf carts, ATV's and skid steer vehicles. In 2019 however Michelin and GM announced their goal of making a new airless tire for passenger vehicles available in 2024. The automotive engineering group of the mechanical engineering department at Clemson University is developing a low energy loss airless tire with Michelin through the NIST ATP project. Crocodile Tyres developed and sells a robust version that bolts to standard mining equipment. Resilient Technologies and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's Polymer Engineering Center are creating a \\"non-pneumatic tire\\", which is basically a round polymeric honeycomb wrapped with a thick, black tread. The initial version of the tire is for the Humvee and is expected to be available in 2012. Resilient Technologies airless tires have been tested and are used by the U.S. Army. It is also the first group to make a commercially available mass-produced airless tire after its acquisition by Polaris, albeit only as coupled with their vehicle. The tire trademark is \\"Terrainarmor\\". Bridgestone is developing the Bridgestone Air-Free Concept Tire, which is similar to the Tweel, and can hold per tire. The Energy return wheel (ERW) has the outer edge of the tire connected to the inner rim by a system of springs. The springs can have their tension changed to vary the handling characteristics. Big Tyre Pty Ltd in Australia is developing a \\"non- pneumatic, non-solid wheel\\", which is designed to handle high working loads, such as those found in underground mines. The wheel utilizes multiple arrays of concentric leaf springs to distribute force evenly across the wheel. A prototype of the wheel was built in 2011, and has been tested on an Eimco 936 underground loader. In 1938, J. V. Martin in the United States invented a safety tire with hoops of hickory encased in rubber and fitted with crisscross spokes of ribbed rubber. It could drive over blocks when tested in a springless test car. Hankook Tire is developing the iFlex airless tire.

She won her seat in the Michigan State Senate in 1952, beating a male candidate for the position. Brown was a Democrat who represented Detroit. Early life Cora Brown was Richard and Alice Brown's only child. She was born in Bessemer, Alabama on April 19, 1914. When better economic conditions did not appear for their family when they moved to Birmingham, her grandparents urged her parents to move north to Michigan. At 8, she moved to Detroit, Michigan, with her family. There, her father established a tailor shop that was supported by Detroit automotive workers. They occupied a neighborhood that was racially diverse. Education Cora was enrolled in the Bishop School when her parents moved the family to Detroit in 1922. Here, she had her first experiences with racial discrimination. A German classmate called her \\"schwarze\\" or \\"black woman,\\" using negative connotations. In 1931, she graduated from Cass Technical High School and entered Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee. She originally intended to study medicine, but found it too difficult to look at the medical cadavers. She quickly changed her concentration to sociological work. During her time at Fisk, she studied sociology with renowned sociologist E. Franklin Frazierand received an A.B. degree. To manage college expenses Cora worked at a Detroit Urban League summer camp for underprivileged children. Cora was known for being particularly active in campus political movements as a student (1931-1935). This commitment was inspired by her strong reaction to the lynching of a young black man accused of rape in Columbia, Tennessee. Her actions on campus indicate her lifelong commitment to social justice. Following graduation, Brown returned to Detroit where she worked from 1941 to 1946 as a policewoman in the Detroit Police Department's Women's Division. Many of her cases involved criminal law. This inspired her to attend Wayne State University's law school, she would pass the bar examination two weeks after her graduation in 1948. Though she did not focus on criminal law during her time in school, Cora remained interested in this pursuit.  Career and Work Outside Politics  Upon graduation from Fisk University in 1935, Brown took advantage of the need for social workers created by the 1929 economic crash. For another five years, she assisted the homeless of Detroit deal with the effects of the Great Depression. At 37, Brown worked as a fines lawyer in Detroit. She made a comfortable living and resided with her mother. Following her work as the special associate general counsel of the US Post Office, she moved to Los Angeles. She opened a small practice there and practiced law until her return to Detroit in 1970. Even when she wasn't working, Cora remained involved in Civil Rights and community building organizations. Brown worked with the NAACP, YWCA, the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and the New Calvary Baptist Church. Political Career and Involvement Brown's political involvement began during her time at Fisk University. As a student she participated in demonstrations and was praised by writer Edward T. Clayton for her \\"willingness to battle injustice.\\" In 1950 and 1951, she ran for a seat on the Michigan State Senate but was defeated. This seat had been up for special election after senator Wilkowski had been accused of election fraud. Her experience in these two campaigns allowed her to make more competitive decisions in her 1952 race. She went door to door and sent trucks around Detroit to spread her message to voters, this campaign was based on her desire to improve hospital, social services, and to decrease racial inequality. Brown's campaign victory in 1952 allowed her to serve two terms (1953-1956). At the time, a Michigan State Senate term was about two years. She served as the state senator for the 2nd District during her first term and served for the 3rd District during her second term. Throughout her time in the Senate, she worked on committees for welfare, public utilities, and health. Brown fought strongly for civil rights and introduced several bills that aided their expansion in Michigan. One such bill increased punishments given to restaurants and hotels that were racially discriminatory from $25 to $100. Another, introduced in 1956, ordered the removal of licenses of business that discriminated on the basis of race. Cora is also noted to be a women's rights activist, as she worked to curb the distribution of pornography through the mail. Newspapers hailed her as the \\"champion of the underprivileged.\\" At times, Cora clashed with her colleagues in the Democratic Party. Her devotion to issues like education, civil rights, health, and labor often challenged more conservative members of her party. She made the decision to change her district in her 1956 run for office, challenging another Democrat who was quite popular. She told constituents not to vote for representatives who would not openly support the Civil Rights Movement, costing her the support of the United Auto Workers Union and the Democratic Party. She supported Dwight Eisenhower when he ran for re-election in 1956 over the Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson, because of his views on civil rights. The same year, Cora attempted to win a seat in Congress. Her candidacy in the Democratic Primary for US representative from Michigan's 1st District was announced following her 1956 selection as the Outstanding Woman Legislator of the year. Ultimately, Brown lacked the support of her party in the election. She would lose by 6,491 votes. In 1957, she was appointed as the special associate general counsel of the US Post Office, where she would work until the Democrats returned to power in 1960. Tracy was the first black woman to hold this post. Later, Brown served as executive director of the President's Committee on Government Contracts, a committee formed to regulate fair employment practices by government contractors. Following ten years in private practice, she returned to Detroit (1970) and joined the Michigan Employment Security Commission as a referee. In popular culture A portrait of Brown, painted by Detroit artist Telitha Cumi Bowens, was included in the 1988/89 exhibit Ain't I A Woman at the Museum of African American History, Detroit. The exhibit featured a dozen prominent Black women from the state of Michigan, including Ethelene Jones Crockett, M.D., Dr. Violet T. Lewis and Lucinda (Lucy) Smith Thurman.

He usually plays at inside centre or fullback. He is one of only two South African rugby players to have won two Rugby World Cups. He was a key member of the South African team that won the 2007 Rugby World Cup and part of the team that won the 2019 Rugby World Cup, where he became only the second South-African player to have won 2 Rugby world Cups, with Os Du Randt being the first. Steyn was a key member of the Springboks team that beat the British and Irish Lions in 2009. He is known for his long distance kicking ability and strong tackling. Club career =Sharks (2007‚Äì2009)= In his debut season of Super 14 rugby for the Sharks, Steyn was selected on the right wing, however, was moved to fullback when Percy Montgomery was injured. He played as the last line of defense until Percy Montgomery returned for the game against the Blues in Round 11, and was moved to fly-half for this game. =Racing Metro (2009‚Äì2012)= In April 2009, Steyn signed a two-year contract with French Top 14 club Racing M√©tro 92 for an estimated ‚Ç¨750,000 per season. Steyn a sign√© au Racing. L'Equipe website. 20 April 2009. =Sharks (2012‚Äì2013)= Steyn rejoined The Sharks by signing a 3-year deal on 29 May 2012. Back with his old team, Steyn played in the Sharks' final two league matches of the 2012 Super Rugby season, helping them to make the finals series. Steyn was not available to them for the knock-outs due to his late entry into the squad. The Sharks went on to lose in the final to The Chiefs. The player made his return for the Sharks in the 2013 Super Rugby competition, captaining the side in the first few matches in the absence of regular skipper, Keegan Daniel. Steyn struggled with form early on in Super Rugby, but as the season progressed, he began to regain the form that first earned him Springbok honours. Once again though, Steyn was injured in the Sharks league match against the Highlanders in Dunedin, which they lost. Steyn would have to wait until the Currie Cup semi- final of 2013 against the Free State Cheetahs to make his next appearance. He was subbed early on in the match, but was again selected for the final against DHL Western Province. Steyn's contributions on attack were good, but it was his immense defense that really marked his successful comeback, and helped the Sharks to Currie Cup victory in 2013. After only 2 matches back, Steyn was not selected for the Springbok end of year tour in 2013. =Toshiba Brave Lupus (2014‚Äì2016)= On 3 June 2014 Steyn signed a two-year deal with Japanese club Toshiba Brave Lupus. Frans Steyn leaves Sharks for Japan. ESPN website. 6 June 2014. =Montpellier (2016‚Äìpresent)= In February 2016, Steyn joined French club Montpellier H√©rault Rugby. International career Francois Steyn in the Springbok change kit, after a pre-match warmup at Murrayfield, 2008 After playing only ten matches for the in the 2006 Currie Cup Premier Division (at fly-half), Steyn was, at 19 years old, selected to represent South Africa in the Northern Hemisphere touring squad by national coach Jake White. He debuted at wing against Ireland, he scored a try on his debut. In his next international match he was moved to fullback against England, scoring a long range drop-goal, from his own half. Steyn has shown to possess superb goal kicking qualities as well. He kicked two drop goals in the 2007 Tri Nations opener against Australia at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town, to win the game for the Springboks. One of these, a 42-metre effort from a fielded clearance kick next to the sideline, and another three minutes from time next to the posts about 30 metres out. In South Africa's first game at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, their centre Jean de Villiers got injured. Steyn replaced him, playing only his second game at professional level at inside centre, but he made a break on first touch of the ball and his inclusion sparked the Springboks to a 37‚Äì0 second half demolition of Samoa. On 24 September 2007 Steyn was cited to appear before a disciplinary hearing for allegedly biting Tongan winger Joseph Vaka during the Springboks v. Tonga 2007 Rugby World Cup game on 22 September. (Match report). Both players were sent to the sinbin in the 60th minute for an off-the-ball incident.\\"South African Steyn cited for biting.\\" Rugby Heaven website. 25 September 2007 ‚Äì 12:35 pm. He was subsequently cleared of the charge, due to insufficient evidence and Vaka conceding that the apparent \\"bite mark\\" could have been received during normal play. Steyn was the starting inside centre for the Springboks in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final, he made a fantastic break that resulted in a penalty for the Boks and also converted one himself later on in the game. He is therefore the youngest player to win a Rugby World Cup. In the Springboks' final match of the 2009 Tri Nations against New Zealand, his last match with the Boks before his departure for France, he converted three penalties from within his own half of the field; he is believed to be the first player ever to do so in a Test match. Reaching his 50th test cap against Argentina in Cape Town in 2012, Steyn is the youngest South African to reach the milestone. Steyn was injured during the 2012 Rugby Championship, missing the final 2 matches, along with the Currie Cup, and the end of year tour to the UK. Steyn was re-called for South Africa for the 2017 series against France due to the injuries of Pat Lambie and Handre Pollard, after a 3-year absence from international rugby. In 2019, Steyn was again called up as part of the South African team to play in the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan and became one of the few players to have won two World Cups, the second only for South Africa.https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/RugbyWorldCup2019/frans-steyn-joins- select-group-of-multiple-world-cup-winners-20191102 References External links * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Aliwal North Category:Afrikaner people Category:White South African people Category:South African people of Dutch descent Category:South African rugby union players Category:South Africa international rugby union players Category:Rugby union fullbacks Category:Alumni of Grey College, Bloemfontein Category:Expatriate rugby union players in France Category:Expatriate rugby union players in Japan Category:Racing 92 players Category:Toshiba Brave Lupus players Category:Sharks (rugby union) players Category:Sharks (Currie Cup) players Category:South African expatriate rugby union players Category:South African expatriate sportspeople in France Category:South African expatriate sportspeople in Japan Category:Super Rugby players ","title":"Fran√ßois Steyn"},{"id":"8036506","text":"The River Washburn is a river in Yorkshire, England. It originates high in the Yorkshire Dales and ends where it meets the River Wharfe. It lies within the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.  Name  The earliest recorded form of the river's name was Walkesburn, from the early 12th century. The name is thought to come from an Old English personal name Walc, not otherwise recorded, so means \\"stream of a man named Walc\\". Course The river's source is at Washburn Head, just south of Stump Cross Caverns and from there flows southwards via Thruscross Reservoir, Blubberhouses, Fewston Reservoir, Swinsty Reservoir and Lindley Wood Reservoir before joining the River Wharfe just north-west of Pool-in-Wharfedale. Reservoirs The Washburn has been dammed to a series of four reservoirs, all built to supply water to the city of Leeds. The lower three (Lindley Wood, Swinsty and Fewston) were built at the end of the 19th century, while the fourth, Thruscross, was delayed until the 1960s. Fewston and Swinsty Reservoirs have a surface area of around 1.6 km¬≤ and a combined length of 4.1 km and Thackray Beck and Spinksburn Beck are major tributaries flowing into these reservoirs. Capelshaw Beck is the main tributary flowing into Thruscross reservoir. Geology Where the valley has not been flooded to make reservoirs, the sides are 'V' shaped. The valley floor consists of solid Millstone Grit overlain with till drift. The drainage can be described as slowly permeable and seasonally waterlogged. The bedrock is covered with fine loam over clay soils and some peat soils at higher elevations on the fringe of the moorland. Geography The river valley has grassland that is intensively managed for livestock. There are also a range of field sizes, bounded by stonewalls often reinforced with post and wire fencing plus some post and rail fencing. There are very large forestry conifer plantations around the reservoirs as well as at Beecroft Moor Plantation, with conifer shelterbelts at Carlhow Ridge Plantation. Deciduous tree clumps can be found around settlements. Ancient Semi-Natural woodland can still be seen at Blubberhouses, Folly Hall Wood, Hanging Wood and Ellers Wood. There is evidence of past quarrying of local stone for buildings and walls. The river valley is crossed by the Harrogate Dales Way Link. Kayaking The section of the river between Thruscross Reservoir and Fewston Reservoir is used for whitewater kayaking when water is released by Yorkshire Water.

Biography Liang was born in Beijing in 1903. His father, Liang Xianxi (Ê¢ÅÂí∏ÁÜô), was a Xiucai in the Qing dynasty. He was educated at Tsinghua College in Beijing from 1915 to 1923. He went on to study at Colorado College and later pursued his graduate studies at Harvard and Columbia Universities. At Harvard, he studied literary criticism under Irving Babbitt, whose New Humanism helped shape his conservative literary tenets. After his return to China in 1926, he began a long career as a professor of English at several universities, including Peking University, Tsingtao University, and Jinan University. He also served as the editor of a succession of literary supplements and periodicals, including the famous Crescent Moon Monthly (1928‚Äì1933). During this period he published a number of literary treatises which showed the strong influence of Babbitt and demonstrated his belief that human life and human nature are the only proper subjects for literature. The best known among these are The Romantic and the Classical, Literature and Revolution, The Seriousness of Literature, and The Permanence of Literature. In each of these treatises, he upheld the intrinsic value of literature as something that transcends social class and strongly opposed using literature for propagandist purposes. These pronouncements and his dislike for the excessive influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other Romanticists in China triggered a polemic war between him and Lu Xun and drew the concerted attacks of leftist writers. His major works as a translator included James Barrie's Peter Pan, George Eliot's Silas Marner and Mr. Gilfil's Love Story, and Emily Bront√´'s Wuthering Heights. In 1949, to escape the civil war, Liang fled to Taiwan where he taught at Taiwan Normal University until his retirement in 1966. During this period, he established himself as a lexicographer by bringing out a series of English-Chinese and Chinese-English dictionaries. His translation works included George Orwell's Animal Farm and Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. Liang is now remembered chiefly as the first Chinese scholar to single-handedly translate the complete works of Shakespeare into Chinese. This project, which was first conceived in 1930, was completed in 1967. He then embarked on another monumental project ‚Äì that of writing a comprehensive history of English literature in Chinese, which was completed in 1979 and consists of a three-volume history and a companion set of Selected Readings in English Literature in Chinese translation, also in three volumes. Liang‚Äôs literary fame rests, first and foremost, on the hundreds of short essays on familiar topics, especially those written over a span of more than four decades (1940‚Äì1986) and collected under the general title of Yashe Xiaopin, now available in English translation under the title From a Cottager‚Äôs Sketchbook. and Bibliography * \\"The Fine Art of Reviling\\".

His first novel, Deviant Behavior, was published by Grove/Atlantic's Black Cat in April 2008. A third collection, Wounded Warriors, was published in October 2008 and received the Military Writers Society of America Founder's Award and the American Author's Association Golden Quill Award. Tattoos & Tequila: To Hell and Back with One of Rock's Most Notorious Frontmen, with Vince Neil, published in September 2010, was a New York Times best seller. His fourth collection, The Someone You're Not, was published by The Sager Group in October 2012, as was Next Wave: America's New Generation of Great Literary Journalists, edited with Walt Harrington. His second novel, High Tolerance, was published by The Sager Group in May 2013.The Devil and John Holmes-25th Anniversary Author's Edition: And Other True Stories of Drugs, Porn and Murder, was published in 2014.Stoned Again: The High Times and Strange Life of a Drugs Correspondent, was published by Byliner Selects in 2015. The Lonely Hedonist: True Stories of Sex, Drugs, Dinosaurs and Peter Dinklage, was published by The Sager Group in 2017. A second edition of Revenge of the Donut Boys was issued by The Sager Group in 2018.  Early life and education  Sager was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, to Beverly Rosenberg and Marvin Miles Sager‚Äîfrom, respectively, Culpeper and Fredericksburg, Virginia. The family, along with younger sister Wendy, eventually settled in Baltimore, Maryland. Sager graduated from Pikesville High School in 1974. At Emory University he played varsity soccer; served as president of his fraternity, Tau Epsilon Phi; was selected to Phi Beta Kappa; and was an editor of several school publications, including the college's literary magazine and weekly newspaper The Emory Wheel. where he served under Henry Schuster, a lifelong friend who would go on to become an award-winning producer at CNN and CBS 60 Minutes During his senior year at Emory, Sager studied creative writing with the noted author and jazz historian Albert Murray, who would have a profound influence on his writing style, introducing the notions of rhythm and music in the context of prose. That year he also interned at the alternative weekly Creative Loafing, his first taste of professional journalism. He received his BA in history in June 1978. That fall, Sager moved to Washington, D.C. to attend the Georgetown University Law Center. He dropped out after three weeks to pursue a career in writing.  Newspapers  After failing the spelling and typing tests administered by the human resources department of the Washington Post, Sager managed to land a lesser position as a copy boy on the 7 p.m. ‚Äî 3 a.m. graveyard shift. Eleven months later, working in his off-hours as a freelancer, Sager broke an investigative story about abuses at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, his first front-page article at the Post. That evening, he was called into the glass office of then-metro editor Bob Woodward and promoted to staff writer. Over the next five years, under the supervision of publisher Donald E. Graham, who had taken an interest in Sager as he worked his way up from copy boy to reporter, Sager moved through the ranks from night police, to cops and courts, to night rewrite, to general assignment, most of that time under Graham's former Harvard roommate, city editor Herb Denton. Along the way, Sager would be assigned to work with newly arrived editor Walt Harrington, who asked him, upon their first meeting, \\"Have you ever read Tom Wolfe?\\" The epiphany of reading Wolfe's primer, The New Journalism, would follow shortly thereafter. (Harrington would go on to author several books, most notably Intimate Journalism, that have been used as primers in universities nationwide. He subsequently served as dean of the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign's College of Media.) In time, Sager became a roving feature writer, charged with covering rural Virginia, a role he would later liken to that of a foreign correspondent.  Breakthrough  In the fall of 1983, Sager took a leave of absence from the Post to travel around Asia and the Far East, doing journalism and seeing the world. For one story, he spent six weeks in Nepal with a group of doctors and medical students; they trekked to a region that had been settled by Tibetan Buddhist refugees and set up a medical clinic. While in Kathmandu, Sager interviewed Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, the King of Nepal, who would later die in a massacre with most of his family. Also on that trip, Sager would research his first piece for Rolling Stone, in Thailand, about expat Vietnam veterans. Upon his return, in early 1984, Sager resigned from the Post to pursue a career in magazines.  Magazines and film  For the next several years, Sager wrote for Washingtonian and Regardie's magazines in Washington. While at Regardie's he wrote a monthly reported column called \\"Washington Beat.\\" In 1987 he became a contributing editor of Rolling Stone; in 1993 he authored a regular column for Rolling Stone called \\"Living in the USA.\\" In late 1993 Sager became a writer-at-large for GQ. He published his first piece in Esquire in 1991 and became a writer-at-large in 1997. He has also written for Vibe, Spy, Interview, The California Sunday Magazine, Smithsonian, and Playboy. More than a dozen of his articles have been optioned for or have inspired Hollywood feature films, including Boogie Nights, starring Mark Wahlberg, Wonderland, starring Val Kilmer, and Veronica Guerin, starring Cate Blanchett. Betrayed by Love, starring Patricia Arquette and Mare Winningham, premiered as a television movie. In 2012, The Marinovich Project, a documentary based on Sager's Esquire article and featuring Sager as a narrator, aired on ESPN.  \\"Literary anthropology\\"  Over the years, Sager has practiced a form of journalism that some have called \\"literary anthropology.\\" For his stories, he has lived with a crack gang in Los Angeles; a 625-pound man in El Monte, California; teenage pit bull fighters in the Philadelphia barrio; Palestinians in the Gaza Strip; heroin addicts on the Lower East Side; Aryan Nations troopers in Idaho; U.S. Marines at Camp Pendleton; Tupperware saleswomen in suburban Maryland; high school boys in Orange County. Since the late nineties, when he moved to California, he has also done dozens of celebrity profiles, including Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Kirk Douglas, Julia Child, Ray Charles, Faye Dunaway, Evel Knievel, Roseanne Barr, Alan Arkin, and Rod Steiger. He has been credited with being the pioneer of Esquire's well known feature, \\"What I've Learned.\\"  Academia and The Sager Group  Sager has read and lectured at many American schools of journalism, including Columbia University, New York University, Northwestern University, the University of Missouri, Marquette University, and in other forums, ranging from the Monarch School for Homeless Children to the Yale Law School. His work is included in three textbooks in use in college classrooms. For four years he led a writing workshop at the University of California, Irvine, where he was a Pereira Visiting Writer. Currently he is a faculty mentor with Goucher College's MFA/Creative Nonfiction program. He lives in San Diego, California. His son is Miles Jacob Sager. In 1984 Sager founded The Sager Group to publish independent books, and has published many works including Next Wave: America's New Generation of Literary Journalists and The Stories We Tell: Classic Tales by America's Greatest Woman Journalists which was recognized by Constance Hale as one of the best books on narrative journalism. In 2018, The Sager Group expanded into multimedia content including documentary, feature and web-based films. TSG Films is headed by Miles Sager.

Vidya Sagar under Sri Gajalakshmi Arts and directed by K. S. R. Das. It stars N.T. Rama Rao, Jayasudha in the lead roles and music composed by Ilaiyaraaja. The film is a remake of the Hindi blockbuster movie Don (1978). Plot Yughandhar (N. T. Rama Rao) is a deadly and daredevil gangster. A special Interpol officer David (Prabhakar Reddy) is assigned to work with SP Jagannath (Jaggayya). In spite of being on Interpol's most wanted list, Yugandhar remains elusive to the police. He kills one of his gang members Ramesh (Prasad Babu) when he finds out that he is an informer of the police. His fianc√©e Kamini (Jayamalini) tries to avenge his death, but Yugandhar kills her also. Thereafter, Ramesh's sister Jaya (Jayasudha) takes judo and karate lessons in order to take revenge and she enters Yugandhar's gang. Once Police get an opportunity to nab Yugandhar, the police finally succeed. Unfortunately, Yugandhar dies, which Jagannath only knows and he secretly buries Yugandhar's body, ensuring that people believe he may still be alive; Jagannath while returning after the funeral of Yugandhar, to his fortune he encounters with Vijay (again N. T, Rama Rao), who resembles Yughandhar. Jagannath hatches a plan to replace Yughandhar with Vijay so he can arrest the rest of the gang. Vijay is a street dancer who adopts two orphan kids and looks after them affectionately. Jagannath requests Vijay to go in place of Yugandhar after assuring him that he will take care of the kids. Vijay agrees. In fact, the kids' father Ram Singh (Satyanarayana) is in jail. Ram Singh used to work in a circus company. He has an extraordinary talent for opening any type of locker. Once Shankar (Tyagaraju) one of the gang members offers Ram Singh to open a bank safe. In the beginning, Ram Singh refuses, but he is compelled to do so when his wife is in serious condition. Unfortunately, he was caught by Jagannath, in that attack Ram Singh loses a limb and his wife dies in hospital. Meanwhile, Jagannath succeeds in sending Vijay into the gang as a person who has lost his memory. Ram Singh, just released from jail, begins his mission against Jagannath and his search for his children. Eventually, as Vijay, learns more and more about Yugandhar and announces to his colleagues that he got back his memory. Vijay manages to replace the red diary which contains entire details of the gang and plans to give it to Jagannath. Jaya goes after him, but Vijay survives the attack and explains that he is Vijay. Jaya apologizes to Vijay and they fall in love. Vijay informs Jaganadham about a celebration where all big smugglers and gangsters of the country are attending. When Jagannath is about to start, Ram Singh obstructs his way, but could not do so as he comes to know that his children are with Jagannath. Jaganadham tells him that he will inform regarding them in his return. But things take a drastic turn when the police raid the celebrations, Vijay's only witness to his true identity, Jagannath, is shot dead, and Vijay is arrested because the police think that he is Yugandhar. The diary that Vijay had handed over to Jagannath, which is his last hope, is stolen by Ram Singh. However, he escapes from the police and he begins to fight for himself and tries to prove his innocence. Jaya agrees to help him. Meanwhile, the gang kidnaps Ram Singh's children to take Vijay into their hold. Ram Singh blackmails the gang as he is possessing the dairy. In that process, he comes to know that Interpol officer David is the original gang leader who also murdered Jagannath. Ram Singh goes to negotiations with David when the police come there and Ram Singh was kept in a room where his children are present, Ram Singh takes children and runs away. At the same time, Vijay arrives, both of them mistake each other as the enemy of the children and a quarrel arose between them. After knowing the truth from the children, both of them join hands, along with Jaya, catch the entire gang and Vijay proves that he is not Yughandhar. Finally, the movie ends on a happy note.

This episode is set mostly on Ferenginar, the homeworld of the profit-seeking Ferengi. In this episode, Quark (Armin Shimerman) visits his mother on Ferenginar and finds she is romantically involved with Grand Nagus Zek, the leader of the Ferengi people. Meanwhile, Quark's brother Rom (Max Grod√©nchik) and Leeta (Chase Masterson) work on their relationship back on Deep Space Nine. Plot Depressed over his lot in life ‚Äì especially being blacklisted by the Ferengi Commerce Authority ‚Äì Quark goes to his homeworld of Ferenginar for some comfort from his mother, Ishka. When he arrives, Quark discovers that the Ferengi leader, Grand Nagus Zek, is romantically involved with Ishka and living in her house. Zek demands Quark keep their affair a secret. Quark is thrilled that his mother is now the beloved of the most powerful man on the planet; Zek refuses to reinstate Quark's revoked business license, however, reminding Quark that it is up to the FCA. Quark returns to his room, where Liquidator Brunt, the FCA agent who revoked his license, confronts him. Brunt offers to restore Quark's business license if he breaks up Zek and Ishka. Quark agrees, and soon places doubts in Zek's head about Ishka's motives. The plan works, and his mother is heartbroken. Brunt keeps his word and renews the business license. Zek offers Quark the position of First Clerk. Quark happily accepts‚Äîand then discovers the Nagus is not the profit-making whiz he once was. By day's end, the Ferengi market exchange has experienced a drastic slide due to the Nagus's failing memory. A stunned Quark returns home, where Ishka reveals that she was more than Zek's lover ‚Äì she was the power behind the throne, helping him make business decisions. Ishka, in turn, realizes that Quark turned Zek against her, and may have destroyed the Ferengi economy in the process. Brunt reveals that his plan was to disgrace Zek, allowing Brunt to become the new Grand Nagus. Quark feels guilty over what he has inadvertently done. The next day, Quark saves Zek by supplying him with enough brilliant advice to turn around the economic situation, but then reveals that the advice actually came from Ishka. After Quark admits to breaking them up, Zek and Ishka happily reunite. Brunt decides to let Quark keep his licence, only so he can see him fail again in the future. In a side plot back on Deep Space Nine, Quark's brother Rom finds his wedding plans being derailed when his Bajoran fianc√©e Leeta refuses to sign a Ferengi document that says she will give up all claim to money and properties. Rom eventually realizes Leeta is more important to him than money or Ferengi traditions and donates all his money to charity, and the wedding is back on.  Reception  In 2015, Geek.com recommended this episode for their abbreviated Star Trek: Deep Space Nine binge-watching guide. In 2018, CBR ranked Grand Nagus Zek, one of the character's featured in this episode, the 13th best recurring character of all Star Trek.

He was closely associated with the Glasite church which he helped to promote. Derek B. Murray, 'Robert Sandeman' in Donald M. Lewis (ed.) Dictionary of Evangelical Biography, Blackwell, 1995, pp 970-971Perth Entrepreneurs: the Sandemans of Springfield by Charles D Waterston, 2008, pages 22‚Äì26: these pages reference other information sources. His importance was such that Glasite churches outside Scotland were known as Sandemanian. Biography =Early Life and Religious Development= He was born the second of twelve children to a linen weaver, David Sandeman and his wife Margaret Ramsay.Derek B. Murray, ‚ÄòSandeman, Robert (1718‚Äì1771)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005 accessed 20 Nov 2006 He attended Edinburgh University over a two-year period beginning in 1734, where he initially seemed destined for a career in either medicine or the established church. It was here, however, where he encountered the teachings of John Glas, and joined his Dundee congregation in 1735. It was during this period that he apprenticed as a linen weaver for a number of years before starting a family business with his brother William.See page 68 of Smith (2008). In 1737 he married Glas' daughter Catherine. They did not have any children by the time of her death in 1746. At the age of 26 he was selected as an elder of the Glasite church in Perth. Following his wife's death, Sandeman devoted his life to his church and scripture. He traveled between Perth, Dundee, and Edinburgh where he served as elder among these Glasite congregations. He was more forceful than Glas and also more controversial. It was he who was largely responsible for spreading the church's doctrines both within Scotland and elsewhere. As a result of this, outside Scotland the Glasite denomination was known as Sandemanian, reflecting his importance. =Growing Influence= In 1757 he came to wider attention by publishing Letters on Theron and Aspasio, in which he attacked the theology of James Hervey (whose Theron and Aspasio had been published in 1755.) In particular Sandeman disagreed with Hervey's idea of imputed righteousness but also put forward the intellectualist perception of religion he shared with Glas and his view that faith was the beginning of a correspondence, leading to full assurance of hope. His work was widely read, and influenced a great many independent clergy throughout England. The Letters drew heated responses from theologians such as John Wesley and John Brine who were more closely aligned with Hervey's views. In the years that followed, Samuel Pike, William Cudworth (1717-1763?), John Barnard (1725-1804? Islington), and Benjamin Ingham, all entered into correspondence with him to help them in their ministries. The first three confessed their faith and were admitted into the London congregation, while the latter reorganized his Inghamite churches along the lines set out by Glasites. Ingham was elected elder in his Tadcaster congregation in 1762. John Barnard's correspondence led to Sandeman's London visit and the establishment of the first Glasite, or outside Scotland, Sandemanian congregation in London at Glover's Hall, Beech Lane, Barbican, 23 March 1762.See pages 38 and 39 of Cantor (1991).See pages 81-83 in Smith (2008).See pages 220, 221, and 261-276 of Wilson, Volume iii (1810). Cudworth, Barnard, and James Allen, a convert from Ingham, were instrumental to Sandeman and Glas in the establishment of Sandemanian congregations throughout England and Wales. =Church planting in America= Sandeman founded one of the first Churches of Christ in America in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on May 4, 1765. In 1760, Letters was published in New England which led to a 1763 invitation to Danbury, Connecticut to advise on church formation. James Cargill (a glover from Dundee, ScotlandSee page 22 of Cantor (1991).) sailed with him aboard the George and James to Boston. Sandeman engaged in some fairly successful discussions while there, founding some churches despite the opposition of orthodox congregationalists. Around this same time, Sandeman's friend, Ebenezer White established a Church of Christ in Danbury, Connecticut. These efforts resulted in approximately eight congregations being planted in New England and one other in Canada. The congregations emphasized a reliance on Scriptures to find church doctrine, weekly communion, biblical church names such as \\"Church of Christ,\\" the oversight of elders and congregational autonomy. The congregations associated with Sandeman had trouble being sustained, likely because of his loyalty to Britain in the years leading up to the American War of Independence.

Kidd was best known for his work during what was known as the Golden Era of British Wrestling. Professional wrestling career Kidd made his professional wrestling debut in a singles match against Tony Scarlo at the Salisbury City Hall in Salisbury, Wiltshire after being trained by the Ampthill Amateur Wrestling Club. Kidd found his most success during the Golden Era of British Wrestling when the television show World of Sport was launched featuring wrestling in the mid-1960s. A practitioner of the British style of wrestling, Kidd found little success in the more modern form of wrestling. However, Kidd would find sanctuary in old-school promotions like Revolution British Wrestling, and Premier Promotions where he won various titles. Kidd still continues to compete in wrestling to this day, wrestling for various promotions around the UK, mostly LDN Wrestling, where has competed on all 4 Legends Showdown events. Outside of wrestling Kidd is a technical advisor for Vauxhall Motors. In October 2009 Kidd lost to Matt Jarrett at GL1 Gloucester Leisure Centre. On 28 February 2010, Kidd competed in a special attraction match against Joel Redman in Tiverton, Devon for the Devon Wrestling Association, which he lost after being attacked with a steel chair. On 30 July 2011, Kidd made his debut for American promotion Chikara, defeating compatriot Johnny Saint in a match contested under World of Sport rules. The following day Saint, teaming with Mike Quackenbush, pinned Kidd, teaming with Colt Cabana, in a tag team match. Kidd made another appearance for the Devon Wrestling Association in February 2012, competing in a mountevans rules match against DWA Trophy holder Nick Riley for the Trophy itself, in which he was unsuccessful. In 2015, Kidd announced his retirement would be held in Chikara in May 2016. On 11 November 2015, Kidd wrestled Japanese wrestler Ultimo Dragon, for Pro Wrestling Pride at PWP Heroes & Legends 2, in a losing encounter, but would return to the company in 2016, wrestling three matches, and winning the PWP Catch Division Championship from Scotty Essex. He would lose the rematch in Teignmouth, Devon in a Mountevens match. On 28 May 2016, Kidd faced Mike Quackenbush at a Chikara event in Manchester in his retirement match, which ended in a draw after eight rounds. Kidd came out of retirement for a Chikara event in Wolverhampton on 2 September 2017, losing to Quackenbush in a British Rules match. On 23 March 2019 Kidd came out of retirement for a one off event in Godalming Surrey for LDN Wrestling losing in both of his matches. On the 7th of December 2019, Johnny Kidd wrestled a match in Bucharest, Romania against Tom Fulton, for the co-main event of that night's end of the year event. The match was part of the Deadly Sinners showcase, put forth by Romanian Wrestling Alliance, or RWA for short. The winner of the encounter was Tom Fulton, after winning rounds 2 and 5 of a British rules match; round 1 and 4 were a tie, with Johnny Kidd winning only round 3.

History It was established in 1979 as John Howard Upper School (for pupils ages 13 to 18). The headmaster for the entire time the school was as John Howard Upper School was Roy Grace. In 1988 the school was merged with Pilgrim Upper to form Biddenham Upper School on the John Howard site. Garry Fitzhugh took over as head when the merger was complete. In October 2008 Biddenham Upper School was awarded International School status by the British Council. The award was made in recognition of Biddenham's international ethos and its links with schools abroad. Following this, the school planned to offer the International Baccalaureate to its sixth form students as an alternative to A level courses from September 2010, however a lack of interest amongst students has led to the baccalaureate being withdrawn at the school. In January 2010, Bedford Borough Council confirmed its intention to move St John‚Äôs School in Kempston in the next few years to a new campus on the site of Biddenham Upper School. However since 1 September 2011, St John‚Äôs School has gained academy status and the plans for the move are on hold. In September 2015 the school began admitting 11 year old pupils.

The blockhouse was declared a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1968. French and Indian War Interior of the blockhouse Fort Halifax (1936) Fort Halifax was a fort on the north bank of the Sebasticook River. (It had previously been the location of the native Fort Taconnet or Taconock, which natives burned upon the approach of Major Benjamin Church during King William's War in the late 17th century.p. 215, p.225 ) Its blockhouse, which survives, is the oldest blockhouse in the United States. (The oldest blockhouse in North America is Fort Edward). It was part of a garrison built by the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1754-1756 at the outset of the French and Indian War. On July 25, 1754, Major General John Winslow arrived with a force of 600 soldiers to establish the fort at the confluence of the Kennebec River with the Sebasticook River. (William Shirley was also on this expedition.https://archive.org/stream/documentsrelativ06newy#page/958/mode/2up/search/halifax) The palisaded defense was intended to prevent Canadiens and their Native American allies from using the Kennebec River valley as a route to attack English settlements. Further, Massachusetts was extending its border into the former region of Acadia and threatening the capital of Canada, Quebec. Fort Richmond was dismantled in 1755 when Fort Shirley (named after William Shirley, also called Frankfort, located in present-day Dresden), Fort Western and Fort Halifax were built upriver. In 1754, Fort Halifax was built by order of the Massachusetts General Court on the peninsula at the confluence of the Sebasticook and Kennebec rivers. The fort was named for George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, the British colonial secretary. A settlement subsequently sprang up under its protection, and was named in honor of Major-General John Winslow, of Marshfield, Massachusetts who had overseen the fort's construction. The Natives raided the fort in the fall of 1754.https://archive.org/stream/documentaryhisto12main#page/334/mode/2upp. 302 In 1755, the commanding officer, Captain William Lithgow, discontinued Major- General Winslow's original plan for the fort, citing limited manpower and expense. The fort was made smaller and more defensible and was completed in 1756.Maine Memory Network Exhibit - Fort Halifax The Canadiens and Natives immediately made plans to destroy the fort. In May 1756, the natives attacked soldiers from the fort. The History of Augusta, from the Earliest Settlement to the Present Time ... By James W. North p.66 In 1756, near Topshee, Col Lithgow and a party of 8 men were ambushed by 17 natives, both sides suffering the loss of two men. The natives later killed two more white men in the area. p.5 The fort was abandoned in 1766, and was sold into private hands.  American Revolution  In September 1775, Fort Halifax hosted troops under Colonel Benedict Arnold on their expedition to Quebec City. At the end of the American Revolution, most of Fort Halifax was dismantled. By the early 19th century, only the blockhouse on the Sebasticook still stood. Later in the century, tourists visited the fort, especially railway passengers and students from Colby College. These guests carved chunks of wood from the blockhouse as souvenirs.Fort Halifax: One Stop on the Way to Quebec  19th - 20th Century  In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, ownership of Fort Halifax blockhouse changed hands numerous times. The structures of the fort deteriorated, and eventually everything except the surviving blockhouse was demolished. From 1924 to 1966, the Fort Halifax Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution owned the blockhouse and was responsible for its upkeep.Deed for Fort Halifax, from Daughters of the American Revolution to State of Maine (1966) The DAR turned the property over to the state in 1966. The town purchased the property surrounding the blockhouse in 1976 and 1982, with the plan to rehabilitate the area and develop a park. On April 1, 1987, a severe flood dismantled the blockhouse. Twenty-two original logs were recovered, some of them found as far south as forty miles. The blockhouse was reconstructed on its original site in 1988. That fall, the rebuilt blockhouse was dedicated in a ceremony that drew hundreds of guests.Fort Halifax on the Kennebec - Northern Outpost for the Massachusetts Bay Colony The Town of Winslow in 2011 drafted plans to rebuild some of the fort and to expand and improve interpretive displays, trails, and recreational opportunities at the site.Fort Halifax Park Concept Master Plan (2011) See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Kennebec County, Maine *List of National Historic Landmarks in Maine Notes References *Fort Halifax.

This expansion cools the air which contracts, at the same time being pushed back by the weight of the displaced water column. The cycle then repeats. The U-tube version has no moving parts in the engine other than the water and air, although there are two check valves in the pump. This engine operates at a natural resonance cycle that is \\"tuned\\" by adjusting the geometry, generally with a \\"tuning tube\\" of water.  Engine as a pump  In the classic configuration, the work produced via the water pistons is integrated with a water pump. The simple pump is external to the engine, and consists of two check valves, one on the intake and one on the outlet. In the engine, the loop of oscillating liquid can be thought of as acting as a displacer piston. The liquid in the single tube extending to the pump acts as the power piston. Traditionally the pump is open to the atmosphere, and the hydraulic head is small, so that the absolute engine pressure is close to atmospheric pressure.

Molecular cytogenetics combines two disciplines, molecular biology and cytogenetics, and involves the analyzation of chromosome structure to help distinguish normal and cancer-causing cells. Human cytogenetics began in 1956 when it was discovered that normal human cells contain 46 chromosomes. However, the first microscopic observations of chromosomes were reported by Arnold, Flemming, and Hansemann in the late 1800s. Their work was ignored for decades until the actual chromosome number in humans was discovered as 46. In 1879, Arnold examined sarcoma and carcinoma cells having very large nuclei. Today, the study of molecular cytogenetics can be useful in diagnosing and treating various malignancies such as hematological malignancies, brain tumors, and other precursors of cancer. The field is overall focused on studying the evolution of chromosomes, more specifically the number, structure, function, and origin of chromosome abnormalities. It includes a series of techniques referred to as fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, in which DNA probes are labeled with different colored fluorescent tags to visualize one or more specific regions of the genome. Introduced in the 1980s, FISH uses probes with complimentary base sequences to locate the presence or absence of the specific DNA regions you are looking for. FISH can either be performed as a direct approach to metaphase chromosomes or interphase nuclei. Alternatively, an indirect approach can be taken in which the entire genome can be assessed for copy number changes using virtual karyotyping. Virtual karyotypes are generated from arrays made of thousands to millions of probes, and computational tools are used to recreate the genome in silico.  Common techniques  = Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) = FISH images of chromosomes from dividing orangutan (left) and human (right) cells. Yellow probe shows 4 copies of a region in the orangutan genome and only 2 copies in human. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization maps out single copy or repetitive DNA sequences through localization labeling of specific nucleic acids. The technique utilizes different DNA probes labeled with fluorescent tags that bind to one or more specific regions of the genome. It labels all individual chromosomes at every stage of cell division to display structural and numerical abnormalities that may arise throughout the cycle. This is done with a probe that can be locus specific, centromeric, telomeric, and whole-chromosomal. This technique is typically preformed on interphase cells and paraffin block tissues. FISH maps out single copy or repetitive DNA sequences through localization labeling of specific nucleic acids. The technique utilizes different DNA probes labeled with fluorescent tags that bind to one or more specific regions of the genome. Signals from the fluorescent tags can be seen with microscopy, and mutations can be seen by comparing these signals to healthy cells.For this to work, DNA must be denatured using heat or chemicals to break the hydrogen bonds; this allows hybridization to occur once two samples are mixed. The fluorescent probes create new hydrogen bonds, thus repairing DNA with their complimentary bases, which can be detected through microscopy. FISH allows one to visualize different parts of the chromosome at different stages of the cell cycle. FISH can either be performed as a direct approach to metaphase chromosomes or interphase nuclei. Alternatively, an indirect approach can be taken in which the entire genome can be assessed for copy number changes using virtual karyotyping. Virtual karyotypes are generated from microarrays made of thousands to millions of probes, and computational tools are used to recreate the genome in silico. = Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) = Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), derived from FISH, is used to compare variations in copy number between a biological sample and a reference. CGH was originally developed to observe chromosomal aberrations in tumour cells. This method uses two genomes, a sample and a control, which are labeled fluorescently to distinguish them. In CGH, DNA is isolated from a tumour sample and biotin is attached. Another labelling protein, digoxigenin, is attached to the reference DNA sample. The labelled DNA samples are co- hybridized to probes during cell division, which is the most informative time for observing copy number variation. CGH uses creates a map that shows the relative abundance of DNA and chromosome number. By comparing the fluorescence in a sample compared to a reference, CGH can point to gains or losses of chromosomal regions. CGH differs from FISH because it does not require a specific target or previous knowledge of the genetic region being analyzed. CGH can also scan an entire genome relatively quickly for various chromosome imbalances, and this is helpful in patients with underlying genetic issues and when an official diagnosis is not known. This often occurs with hematological cancers. = Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) = Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) allows CGH to be performed without cell culture and isolation. Instead, it is performed on glass slides containing small DNA fragments. Removing the cell culture and isolation step dramatically simplifies and expedites the process. Using similar principles to CGH, the sample DNA is isolated and fluorescently labelled, then co-hybridized to single stranded probes to generate signals. Thousands of these signals can be detected for at once, and this process is referred to as parallel screening. Fluorescence ratios between the sample and reference signals are measured, representing the average difference between the amount of each. This will show if there is more or less sample DNA than is expected by reference.  Applications  A cell containing a rearrangement of the bcr/abl chromosomal regions (upper left red and green chromosome). This rearrangement is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and was detected using FISH. FISH chromosome in-situ hybridization allows the study cytogenetics in pre- and postnatal samples and is also widely used in cytogenetic testing for cancer. While cytogenetics is the study of chromosomes and their structure, cytogenetic testing involves the analysis of cells in the blood, tissue, bone marrow, or fluid to identify changes in chromosomes of an individual. This was often done through karyotyping, and is now done with FISH. This method is commonly used to detect chromosomal deletions or translocations often associated with cancer. FISH is also used for melanocytic lesions, distinguishing atypical melanocytic or malignant melanoma. Cancer cells often accumulate complex chromosomal structural changes such as loss, duplication, inversion or movement of a segment. When using FISH, any changes to a chromosome will be made visible through discrepancies between fluorescent- labelled cancer chromosomes and healthy chromosomes. The findings of these cytogenetic experiments can shed light on the genetic causes for the cancer and can locate potential therapeutic targets. Molecular cytogenetics can also be used as a diagnostic tool for congenital syndromes in which the underlying genetic causes of the disease are unknown. Analysis of a patient's chromosome structure can reveal causative changes. New molecular biology methods developed in the past two decades such as next generation sequencing and RNA- seq have largely replaced molecular cytogenetics in diagnostics, but recently the use of derivatives of FISH such as multicolour FISH and multicolour banding (mBAND) has been growing in medical applications.  Cancer projects  One of the current projects involving Molecular Cytogenetics involves genomic research on rare cancers, called the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI). The CGCI is a group interested in describing the genetic abnormalities of some rare cancers, by employing advanced sequencing of genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes, which may ultimately play a role in cancer pathogenesis. Currently, the CGCI has elucidated some previously undetermined genetic alterations in medulloblastoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The next steps for the CGCI is to identify genomic alternations in HIV+ tumors and in Burkitt's Lymphoma. Some high-throughput sequencing techniques that are used by the CGCI include: whole genome sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, ChIP-sequencing, and Illumina Infinum MethylationEPIC BeadCHIP.

The area is named after the prestigious Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club, which has been part of the area since 1876. Hunt Club Road and many local businesses were also named after the golf course. Hunt Club is located just north of the Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport and to the east of the Rideau River. The Hunt Club Community Organization defines the boundaries as the Rideau River to the west, the CP Prescott rail line now used by the O-Train Trillium Line to the east, the CN Albion line and Via Rail Beachburg Subdivision to the north, and the boundary of the old City of Ottawa (about half a block south of Hunt Club Road) to the south.https://hunt- club.ca/map.html The population of the area is about 12,546 (2016 Canada Census). 16% of its 590 ha area is publicly accessible green space. It has 7 city parks: Cahill, McCarthy, Owl, Paul Landry, Riverwood, Uplands, and Uplands Riverside. In addition, many of its residents live in townhouse co-ops and condos that have their own community centers and recreational facilities, and some are members of the Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club with access to their 87 ha green space. It has three times the green space as the Ottawa average, including the Sawmill Creek wetlands and Rideau River shoreline. It has a widely mixed demographic in age groups, ethnocultural backgrounds, socio- economic levels and family set ups. It includes single dwellings, semi- detached and townhouse units, apartment buildings, retirement homes, and an exceptional number of co-ops and condos that offer rent-to-income housing and village-like living. Its housing ranges from million dollar mansions to three Ottawa Community Housing projects. It has the second largest complex of Asian markets and services in Ottawa. A summer Asian cultural festival offers unrivalled access to many Asian foods. Hunt Club was originally settled by Europeans in the early nineteenth century. It was originally part of Gloucester Township. In 1950 the still largely rural area was annexed to the city of Ottawa. Development of the area got underway in the 1970s, and that is when most of the current housing dates from. It was designed as a bedroom community with little commercial area. Hunt Club is in the federal and provincial riding of Ottawa South, and the area is one of the more conservative portions of that riding. Municipally central Hunt Club is in River Ward. One of the more prominent, and controversial areas, of the neighbourhood is the large Hunt Club Woods area. This region next to the CN rail lines was purchased by the National Capital Commission in 1953 with plans of turning it into part of a major ring road around Ottawa. These plans never materialized and the area has been an undeveloped mix of farm land, open meadows, and forests ever since. The NCC hopes to sell their considerable holdings to developers, and have the area turned into a new subdivision. Residents and greenspace advocates have fought this, hoping to preserve much of the area as open land.

The Latin motto of the school is \\"Docendo discimus\\", which means \\"We learn by the way of teaching\\" (Hungarian: Tan√≠tva tanulunk). The ancestor of the school was founded by Istv√°n Szegedi Kis in 1545. The Protestant church used the school to provide the congregations with pastors and teachers during the Ottoman invasion of Hungary. In 1686 the Ottomans burned down the city, including the school. It was rebuilt in 1713 as a state school. In 1812 it became the \\"Great School\\" (Hungarian: Nagy Oskola). During the Hungarian Soviet Republic the school's name was B√©la Kun Primary School. After the demise of the Soviet Republic, the school changed its name back to K√°lvin Street Primary School, which was the name until the school merged with B√©la Bart√≥k School.

It was built in Early-Classicism style about 180 years before, with cellar and attic. There is teaching in that nowadays too, on the first floor are the foreign language classrooms (English, German) and the religious study-circles and other afternoon abilities. On the ground floor is the student and teacher dining hall and the kitchen. The old building is about 80 years old, the old Bethlen Internate's building make place for the mathematic, informatic, Hungarian classrooms, the library, the teacher's room, and the media-singing classroom. In the year of 2006 this classroom was modernised by a beamer, movie projector to make it the level of other classrooms. The newest unit, the new building was built in 1982. Here is the education of lower classes, and on the ground are the crafts classrooms, the nowadays don't used furnace and the cubicles. The K√°lvin Street complex has two (small and large) gyms, a sports field, a running field that is covered with cinder, and two jumpingfield that were in 2005 rebuilt with new bricks. = Bart√≥k building = In 1997 this school become the part of the Downtown Primary School, Elementary Arts Educational Institution and Logopedical Institute, this give the end \\"Elementary Arts Educational Institution\\".

Sponge cake is a common base, but a torte's cake layers may instead be made with little to no flour, using ingredients such as ground nuts or breadcrumbs.  Origin  Food writer Julie R.

Whiskey torte The best-known of the typical tortes include the Austrian Sachertorte and Linzertorte, the German Schwarzw√§lder Kirschtorte, and the many-layered Hungarian Dobos torte. But other well-known European confections are also tortes, such as the French G√¢teau St. Honor√©. In Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Russia cakes are usually called tortes without differentiating between cake and torte. In Polish, as an example, the word torte is translated into Polish as tort, but tort can be also translated as layer cake or cream cake. Icing An element common to some tortes is sweet icing (exceptions are several French tortes, such as G√¢teau Merc√©d√®s and G√¢teau Alcazar.) When the cake is layered, a thick covering of icing is placed between the layers, and there is almost always icing on the tops and sides of the torte. An example is the whiskey cake.

He was a son of Eduardo de Ory, who was a modernist poet and founder of the Academia Hispanoamericana de C√°diz (Cadiz's Spanish American Society). In the circle of friends of Eduardo de Ory were poets as Salvador Rueda, Amado Nervo, Juan Ram√≥n J√≠m√©nez, Manuel Reina and Rub√©n Dar√≠o. Ory was fundamental in modernizing post-Spanish Civil War poetry by creating work that engaged major twentieth-century European avant-gardes such as Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism. He, along with Eduardo Chicharro and the Italian poet Silvano Sernesi, was the co- founder of a poetry movement called Postismo (Postism). Postism consisted of a loose group of writers creating work that valued language play and was set against the neo-romanticism of Spain‚Äôs official literary culture. Among the writers associated with the movement are √Ångel Crespo, Gloria Fuertes, Juan Eduardo Cirlot, and Gabriel Celaya. Ory twice tried to bring out a literary journal to advance the work and tenets of Postism, but on both occasions the journal was censored by the fascist government of Franco and was not allowed to be distributed. In the face of so much opposition, Postism was short-lived and faded into obscurity with Ory himself continuing to write and publish far from the public view. He ended up leaving Spain for France in the 1960s to escape the suffocating literary and political environment. It was only in the 1970s that poets and critics (particularly Catalan poet and critic Jaume Pont) essentially re-discovered Postism and Ory. Since that time, both Ory and the movement have been increasingly recognized and influential on the Spanish literary landscape. Ory‚Äôs role in Spain is analogous to that of Allen Ginsberg and the Beat poets in the United States: he opened Spanish poetry up to new possibilities of poetic language and content. In fact, Ginsberg, along with Edith Grossman, translated a volume of Ory‚Äôs poetry, though the book never made it into circulation. Ginsberg also dedicated a poem to Ory in his book Cosmopolitan Greetings. For almost six decades Ory has been one of Spain‚Äôs most innovative and original writers, publishing numerous works of poetry and criticism. He lived with his wife, French artist Laura Lach√©roy, in the village of Th√©zy-Glimont in France until his death on November 11, 2010 of leukaemia.

He is Regents Professor and McKnight Presidential Chair in Ecology at the University of Minnesota, as well as an instructor in Conservation Biology; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior; and Microbial Ecology. He is director of the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve long-term ecological research station. Tilman is also a professor at University of California, Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.  Early life and education  Tilman (born Titman) was born in Aurora, Illinois in 1949. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in zoology in 1971 and his PhD in ecology in 1976 at the University of Michigan. Some of his doctoral research was published in the journal Science.  Career and research In an August 2001 interview, Tilman states that his passion with ecology stems from his love for both math and biology, and ecology is a field that allows him to express both together along with his love for the outdoors. His work explores how both natural and managed ecosystems can be used to meet the needs of humans, whether it be for food, energy, or ecosystem services. Tilman has performed several studies to further determine the usefulness of grasslands for utilization in biofuel. = Resource competition= Tilman is best known for his work on the role of resource competition in community structure and on the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning. One of his most cited articles is the 1994 Nature article on the Biodiversity and stability in grasslands which provided data regarding an experiment that began in 1982 with more than 200 plots in a grassland field in the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota. Each of these plots was continuously monitored for 20 years for factors such as species richness and biomass created by the community. Tilman's article looked at data both prior to and following a drought on the grassland plots in 1988, which provided surprising results. The drought provided substantial disturbance and the biomass data showed a strong positive correlation between the plant diversity within the community and the stability of the community as a whole supporting the diversity-stability hypothesis. \\"The level to which the soil solution concentration of a limiting resource is reduced by an equilibrial monoculture of a species is called R*. R* is the resource concentration a species requires for it to be able to persist in a habitat. A comparable concept, that of threshold density, exists for host-microparasite inter-actions. The species with the lowest R* for a limiting soil resource is predicted to be the superior competitor for that resource.\\" With regards to succession he focuses on resource ratios, particularly between light and nitrogen. After a big disturbance, the pattern of succession is from high light/low nitrogen towards high nitrogen/low light environment. = Competition and biodiversity= Another article by Tilman that has received substantial citation is his 1994 Ecology article that encompasses the idea that large numbers of species can coexist in a small habitat even when they require the same limiting nutrient (such as nitrogen), as long as there is a tradeoff between the species. Basically it means that they can coexist because species that are good competitors are not as good at colonizing or reproducing. In a related paper, Tilman used this model to demonstrate the phenomenon of \\"extinction debt,\\" which refers to the time delay between habitat destruction and the extinction of species. =Awards and honors= In 2014, he received the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Ecology and Conservation Biology category, for scientifically establishing the value of biodiversity, quantifying, for the first time, how it contributes to make ecosystems more productive, more resilient to invasions, and more stable in the face of perturbations such as drought. He has been a Guggenheim Fellow, is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a member of the National Academy of Science. In 2000 Tilman was designated the Most Highly Cited Environmental Scientist of the Decade by Essential Science Indicators. *1996: Robert H.

It was centered near the city of Muzaffarabad, and also affected Balakot city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some areas of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. It registered a moment magnitude of 7.6 and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The earthquake also affected countries in the surrounding region where tremors were felt in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Chinese Xinjiang. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. It is considered the deadliest earthquake to hit South Asia, surpassing the 1935 Quetta earthquake. Earthquake Kashmir lies in the area of collision of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable seismicity in the region. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicentre about northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, and north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad. =Damage= Map depicting regional tectonic plates Most of the devastation hit north Pakistan and Pakistan administered Kashmir. In Kashmir, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad. Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties. The Pakistani government's official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could reach over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter. As Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck. Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. Many people were also trapped in their homes and, because it was the month of Ramadan, most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage. USGS Shakemap for the event :\\"...a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now\\", Kofi Annan said on 20 October with reference to the thousand remote villages in which people are in need of medical attention, food, clean water and shelter and the 120,000 survivors that have not yet been reached.\\"\\"Thousands at risk of starving in earthquake aid shortfall\\" The Times, 21 October 2005.

According to Pakistan's Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz \\"made the appeal to survivors\\" on 26 October to come down to valleys and cities for relief, because bad weather, mountainous terrain, landslides and blocked roads are making it difficult for relief workers to reach each house and the winter snows are imminent.\\" In Islamabad, the Margalla Towers, an apartment complex in sector F-10, collapsed and killed many of the residents. Four deaths were reported in Afghanistan, including a young girl who died in Jalalabad, after a wall collapsed on her. The quake was felt in Kabul, but the effects were minimal there. =Aftershocks= There were many secondary earthquakes in the region, mainly to the northwest of the original epicentre. A series of strong aftershocks occurred near Muzaffarabad.\\"Pak in panic as quake rocks Kashmir\\" Reuters, The Financial Express, 19 October 2005. Retrieved 23 February 2006. As of 27 October 2005\\"Pakistan: A summary report on Muzaffarabad earthquake\\" ReliefWeb, 7 November 2005. Retrieved 23 February 2006. there had been more than 978 aftershocks with a magnitude of 4.0 and above that continued to occur daily. Since then, measurements from satellites have shown that mountain parts directly above the epicenter have risen by a few meters, giving ample proof that the rising of the Himalayas is still going on, and that this earthquake was a consequence of that.BBC series: Earth: The Power of the Planet., part 1. Volcano Response Pakistani soldiers carry tents away from a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter The national and international humanitarian response to the crisis was extensive. In the initial phases of response, the Pakistan Medical corps, Corps of Engineers, Army aviation and a large number of infantry units played important roles. Lt. Gen Afzal, Maj. Gen. Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj. Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co- ordination. The relief work in Jammu and Kashmir was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and Jaipal Singh. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international NGOs with high pay scales. The rest of the money pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority, which was made by then military regime to accommodate retired high military officials and while keeping the command of the reconstruction and rehabilitation authority directly under the military. The basic infrastructure, including tertiary care, health, education, road networks, water supply, waste management and other basic needs, was still underdeveloped and had not reached pre-earthquake status in the region. Well over US$ 5.4 billion (400 billion Pakistani rupees) in aid arrived from all around the world. US Marine and Army helicopters stationed in neighbouring Afghanistan quickly flew aid into the devastated region along with five CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the Royal Air Force that were deployed from the United Kingdom. Five crossing points were opened on the Line of Control (LOC), between India and Pakistan, to facilitate the flow of humanitarian and medical aid to the affected region, and aid teams from different parts of Pakistan and around the world came to the region to assist in relief.\\"Pakistan Asks Quake Survivors to Leave Mountains Before Winter\\" (Bloomberg News), 26 October 2005.

The term is synonymous primarily with the advertising of prescription medicines via mass media platforms‚Äîmost commonly on television and in magazines, but also via online platforms. Direct-to-consumer advertising is only completely legal in New Zealand and the United States, but are subject to regulations regarding the balanced disclosure of a prescription's benefits in comparison to its risks (including but not limited to side effects and contraindications), among other factors. Regulations regarding DTCA are typically applied to advertising materials that describe a prescription's indications and benefits, and may be more lenient to advertising materials which do not discuss uses. Many countries ban any advertising of prescription drugs directly to consumers. There are ethical and regulatory concerns regarding DTCA, specifically the extent to which these ads may unduly influence the prescribing of the prescriptions based on consumer demands when, in some cases, they may not be medically necessary, or there are cheaper options available. Critics of DTCA have argued that too much is spent on marketing medications, rather than into research and development; in the United States, ad spending by drugmakers reached US$5.2 billion in 2016. Types The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines several common types of DTCA for prescription medication. It classifies a \\"product claim\\" advertisement as one that identifies the scientific name and trademark brand name of the medication, and contains at least one approved indication for the drug, and claims surrounding its benefits. A \\"reminder\\" advertisement serves primarily to build brand recognition rather than promote the drug's uses and benefits. A reminder ad cannot contain any information or imagery that pertains to the drug itself, including benefits or how it functions, but may still contain a call to action urging viewers to ask their doctor or seek an external resource for more information. Reminder ads may include themes that vaguely allude to the drug's purpose: for example, a reminder commercial for the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra featured the showtune \\"Good Morning\\" and scenes of a man happily walking to work, emphasizing a sexual innuendo in the lyric \\"it's great to stay up late\\". A \\"help-seeking\\" advertisement is not presented as marketing for a drug first and foremost, and instead resemble an awareness campaign for a specific medical condition. They do not specify any specific product or treatment, and direct the audience to ask their doctor or seek an external resource (such as a website or phone hotline) for more information. These outlets are, in turn, used to promote specific prescription options. Awareness campaigns of this nature are sometimes used as preliminary marketing for new drugs. Reminder and help-seeking ads are often used by drugmakers to bypass the more onerous restrictions (such as the required listing of side effects), or outright prohibitions on product claims advertising, as neither of them are focused on promoting the drug itself. Sometimes, a campaign may mix both of these ads, with one ad discussing the condition, and another, similarly-styled ad, mentioning the product but not the condition, seeking to have the viewer infer the association between the ads. Legality =Brazil= In 2008 a new resolution from ANVISA (Control Agency for Sanitary Vigilance), Resolution 96 from December 17 was released, with focus on medication advertisements. It allows direct-to-consumer advertising of non-prescription medication, with restrictions on the type of drug and words and images that can be used, among other things. Advertisements for prescription medications can only appear in scientific, medical, or health professional journals. =Canada= The Food and Drugs Act prohibits most direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medications: all direct-to- consumer advertising of drugs was forbidden until 1978, when Health Canada began to allow ads containing names, quantities, and prices only, so that pharmacies could display their prices for comparison purposes. In 2000, Health Canada adopted an interpretation of this law allowing for the aforementioned \\"reminder\\" and \\"help-seeking\\" advertisements, although U.S.-style \\"full product ads\\" that mention the purpose of a prescription remain prohibited. Later that year, Health Canada ruled that a pairing of similarly-themed reminder and help-seeking commercials ran afoul of the regulations, as their combination constituted a full product ad. There is no regulation requiring direct-to-consumer ads illegal under Canadian law to be removed or substituted when U.S. television channels and print publications are distributed within Canada. In 2014, York University professor and physician Dr. Joel Lexchin, and University of British Columbia associate professor Barbara Mintzes, published a study that highlighted 10 DTC cases between 2000 and 2011 with \\"unsatisfactory\\" responses from Health Canada. They found that Health Canada's application of these regulations \\"[lacked] accountability and transparency\\"‚Äîwith no public record of complaints and enforcement besides media coverage of certain prominent cases, and no evidence that Health Canada has ever issued fines for violations. In conclusion, they stated that \\"since DTCA became prominent in the U.S. in the mid-1990s, successive governments of different political stripes in Canada have shown a remarkably consistent commitment to non-enforcement\\". =Europe= In October 2002, the European Commission voted against a proposal to selectively allow advertising of \\"disease education information\\" in relation to AIDS, asthma, and diabetes. Despite insistence otherwise due to its selective and controlled nature, the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety assessed that the pharmaceutical industry could not be trusted to provide impartial and unbiased information. UK Labour Party MEP Catherine Stihler argued that the proposal was a \\"slippery slope\\" towards U.S.-style advertising practices promoting expensive \\"wonder drugs\\", and that \\"we don't want consumers sitting on their couches bombarded with a hard sell from big drug companies in the advertising break between Crossroads and Coronation Street.\\" =Hong Kong= Under the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance, advertising of medications is only legal for \\"minor\\" diseases, such as coughs and colds, headaches, indigestion, and others. Ads may not include depictions of treatment, medical professionals, or dramatizations of symptoms. =New Zealand= Under the Medicines Act of 1981, and regulated by the Therapeutic Products Advertising Code and a self-regulatory code by the industry group Medicines New Zealand, New Zealand is one of the only countries beside the United States to allow direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medications. An ongoing review of the Act to develop a replacement, the Therapeutic Products Bill, has faced lobbying efforts for and against the continued legality of DTCA. =United Kingdom= Advertising materials directed towards the general public are prohibited from containing any references to prescription-only medications, under the basis that they are not be presented as a consumer's choice. The home page of a drug manufacturer's website also constitutes advertising material, and thus may not include references to prescription products either. In a 2005 Health Select Committee hearing, GlaxoSmithKline UK general manager Eddie Gray stated that the company did not plan to lobby for DTC in the region, citing prevailing consumer attitudes against the concept. =United States= Under the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), direct-to-consumer \\"product claim\\" advertisements for a prescription medication must include information on their major side effects and contraindications in the main body, with a \\"fair balance\\" in its coverage of benefits to risks. Unless they are given \\"adequate provision\\" via a variety of different outlets, ads must also include a \\"brief summary\\" of all risks associated with the medication. In print ads within magazines, this summary is typically given on a second page. Print ads must contain a standard notice that instructs patients to report negative side effects to the FDA's MedWatch program. In ads carried on broadcast media, such as television commercials, only the major side effects are typically listed, and the ad contains blurbs directing viewers to where they can obtain more information (the aforementioned \\"brief summary\\"), such as on a website, phone hotline, or a current magazine issue. If the drug is subject to a boxed warning from the FDA (which indicates a serious risk), the warning must be reproduced in all advertising materials, and reminder ads for the drug are prohibited. Ads that do not make health claims do not fall under the FDA's jurisdiction, but can still be regulated by the Federal Trade Commission.  Early history  In 1962, the United States Congress gave the FDA the authority to regulate prescription drug labeling and advertising, but the FDA did not establish regulations until 1969. These required that ads for prescriptions include information on their major side effects and contraindications, and unless they have \\"adequate provision\\" via different outlets, a \\"brief summary\\" of all side effects and contraindications. Pharmaceutical companies shifted the focus of their marketing efforts to licensed medical doctors in the 1970s, as the FDA mandated that only doctors could prescribe medicine. However, a larger movement towards autonomy in health care decisions prompted the first prominent examples of direct-to- consumer advertising. Merck published the first print DTC ad for a pneumonia vaccine (with a particular focus on those aged 65 years or older), and Boots Pharmaceuticals aired the first DTC television commercial in 1983 for the prescription ibuprofen Rufen. The advertisement promoted it as a cheaper alternative to the leading brand Motrin, and did not contain health claims. The FDA briefly demanded that the Rufen ad be pulled, but it was restored after minor amendments. As its guidelines were not written with mass media in mind, these early campaigns prompted concern from the FDA, especially after the arthritis drug Oraflex (whose release had been backed by a significant PR campaign) was recalled after only five months on the market, following reports of adverse reactions and deaths. FDA commissioner Arthur Hayes showed reservations for the impact that DTCA would have on the industry and public health, and called for a moratorium in September 1983 pending further regulations. The moratorium was lifted in 1985. The industry felt that the requirement for a \\"brief summary\\" of all side effects was designed with print media in mind, and that their increasing length and technical language (often taking up an entire separate page of fine print when published in a magazine) made television advertising of prescriptions unfeasible. By the 1990s, there were calls for the FDA to loosen its regulations to make the concept viable.  Partial deregulation  A 1996 marketing campaign for then-prescription allergy medication Claritin found a loophole, by intentionally excluding information about the medication itself from its advertising. Clartin's television commercial contained only imagery, slogans such as \\"Clear days and nights are here\\" and \\"It's time for Claritin\\", and instructions to ask a doctor or call a phone number to request more information. In 1997, the FDA issued new guidelines that intended to make DTCM on radio and television less burdensome. In particular, the FDA clarified that informing the audience of where the \\"brief summary\\" can be obtained (such as a magazine ad, phone hotline, or website) constituted \\"adequate provision\\" of risk information, and thus relieved them from being included in the ad. The FDA also recognized reminder ads (such as the aforementioned Claritin ad) as not being subject to these rules, since they do not make any claims or statements regarding the indications and benefits of the medication. The industry quickly took advantage of the new guidelines: by 1998, advertising spending on DTCA had reached $1.12 billion. Despite this growth, there were concerns that some ads had an insufficient focus on properly discussing the product, while concerns were also shown for the advertising of erectile dysfunction medications during programming that may be widely watched by children. In 2005, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) instituted new voluntary guidelines for DTCA, including requirements to voluntarily submit ads to the FDA for review and educate health professionals on new medications before an advertising campaign commences, use clear language in advertising, obtain appropriate age targeting for advertisements involving subject matter that may be inappropriate to certain audiences, and to not use \\"reminder\\" ads. By 2011, spending on pharmaceutical advertising had grown to approximately US$4.5 billion per year, and increased to $5.2 billion by 2016. With the increasing spending, DTCA began to face opposition. In 2015, the American Medical Association's house of delegates voted in favor of a motion supporting the prohibition of DTCA, arguing that these marketing efforts contribute to the high cost of drugs, and \\"inflates demand for new and more expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be appropriate\\". On March 4, 2016, Senator Al Franken introduced the Protecting Americans from Drug Marketing Act, which proposed the removal of tax breaks for pharmaceutical companies who engage in DTCA. Franken similarly showed concerns that the industry was spending too much on marketing. In a similar move, representative Rosa DeLauro called for a three-year moratorium on advertising of newly-approved prescription drugs.  Proposed display of list prices  On May 8, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) approved a mandate for list prices to be displayed in advertising for any prescription that costs $35 or higher for 30 days of treatment. Ads could also include price comparisons against competitors. PhRMA objected to the rule, arguing that prominent display of list prices would cause confusion because they do not reflect what patients would typically pay under insurance coverage (the rule did require display of a disclaimer stating that those with health insurance may pay a different amount). When the rule was proposed in October 2018, PhRMA stated that its members would commit to publishing detailed pricing information online (including possible out-of-pocket costs, and information on financial support options), and directing viewers to this information within their advertising. However, the HHS disputed their arguments, arguing that list prices would help patients calculate how much they would pay, especially if they have not yet met their insurance deductible, or the drug is not covered by their insurance. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar compared the proposed requirement to similar regulations involving list prices for automobiles. On July 8, 2019, shortly before it was to take effect, the rule was struck down by DC district judge Amit Mehta, who ruled that it overstepped the HHS' authority. Reception Supporters of direct-to-consumer advertising argue that advertisements increase competition which leads to lower prescription drug prices and new development, citing, for instance, that between 1997 and 2001, spending on research and development in the U.S. increased 59% while spending on promoting drugs directly to patients increased 145%. However, other experts have asserted that funding for R&D; is determined by several other factors. Direct-to-consumer advertising, among other patient education initiatives, can educate consumers and patients about new treatments and therapeutic options that may not have been proactively mentioned by their healthcare professional. Proponents of DTCA claim this provides a vital opportunity for the public to be aware of what is available to them and to engage in an educated discussion with their doctor. A study observed that direct-to-consumer advertising promotes communication between patients and their doctors about medications. Thirty percent of Americans indicated they talk with their doctor about a medicine they saw on TV. In addition, surveys showed that increased advertising has had a positive impact on the degree to which people adhere to a given course of treatment ‚Äì but only among those who were already on medication prior to exposure to direct-to-consumer advertising. Among this population, a 10% increase in exposure to drug advertising increases the rate of adherence between 1% and 2%. Some studies have asserted that direct-to-consumer advertising misleads patients into demanding heavily-advertised drugs, leading to superfluous or sub-optimal treatment. Doctors may feel pressured to prescribe specific brand-name medications because they were mentioned by a patient.Metzl, Jonathan. ‚ÄúSelling Sanity Through Gender.‚Äù Ms Magazine, Fall, 2003. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 47% of all antibiotics prescribed in the United States were unnecessary. Another study of young people living in West Palm Beach, Florida found that a 10% increase in advertising expose increased the total number of prescriptions by 5%; a higher percentage change than in Denver, Colorado ‚Äì where DTCA expenditures per person are lower. =Market impact= It has been argued that direct-to-consumer advertising can influence the doctor‚Äìpatient relationship, including patients bringing up their need for an advertised, name-brand drug as their primary concern during a doctor visit, and becoming interested in newly-introduced medications that may not have undergone sufficient postmarketing surveillance. It has been demonstrated that direct-to-consumer ads have contributed to the frequency of requests made by patients towards their physicians to prescribe analgesic drugs, including opioids. A patient's request for a specific medication dramatically increases the rate at which physicians prescribe usually more expensive, branded drugs even when treatment for existing indications does not warrant such use. Pharmaceutical companies have also faced allegations of \\"disease mongering\\"‚Äîthe process of promoting awareness of minor conditions such as balding and skin wrinkles in such a way that it encourages the sale of treatments for them. Critics also argue that resources spent on advertising could otherwise be spent on research and development for new drugs and medical therapies. Danish physician Peter C. G√∏tzsche indicated that pharmaceutical companies will advertise for their most profitable products, many of which are unnecessary \\"me-too\\" drugs. He maintains that \\"there is no need for marketing, as the products should speak for themselves.\\" =Drug safety= Advertisements generally begin within a year of drugs entering the market, before postmarketing surveillance is available to see if adverse effects emerge, which increases the risk of harm. In the early 2000s, the FDA's resources to screen DTC ads were not keeping pace with the number of ads being produced, raising the risk that the inappropriate ads were not removed. Vioxx was heavily marketed and was widely-prescribed after its approval in 1999. When the drug was withdrawn for safety reasons in 2004, Merck, its developer, and the FDA were criticized for the campaign. Several DTC ads have faced criticism or FDA warnings over containing depictions of activities that are part of a prescription's contraindications, such as an advertisement for the blood thinner Xarelto which featured scenes of a patient spokesperson among motorcycles (despite a disclaimer stating that the spokespatient had to stop riding her motorcycle whilst taking the medication), and a print ad for the Factor IX treatment Idelvion containing an image of a soccer player (with the FDA warning that soccer was a \\"moderate to dangerous high-risk activity for hemophilic patients\\", and that the ad falsely implied patients could engage in such activity without consequences). =Gender stereotypes= Some drug ads have \\"gendered\\" diseases in ways that do not reflect actual epidemiology. Women's bodies have also been objectified to mask or distract from unpleasant aspects of diseases. The marketing of drugs for inflammatory bowel disease have been called out on both counts. Similarly, the marketing of Gardasil was primarily aimed at young women, when sexually transmitted diseases are carried by, and affect, both genders.

In Spain and New Spain Antonio Caballero was born into a hidalgo family in C√≥rdoba. His parents were Juan Caballero y Espinar and Antonia de G√≥ngora. He studied first in C√≥rdoba. At the age of 15 he received a scholarship to study theology in the Colegio de San Bartolom√© y Santiago in Granada. He continued his studies at the Colegio Imperial de Santa Catalina, graduating in 1744. He was ordained a priest on September 19, 1750. About this time he wrote a biography of the Granadan poet Jos√© Antonio Porcel y Salablanca. In 1753 he was named canon of the cathedral of C√≥rdoba, where he remained until 1775. He was a cultured man and a lover of the arts. He collected paintings by Vel√°zquez, Rubens, Titian, etc., and his library contained the most modern works on all branches of knowledge. He was also a numismatist. He was named bishop of M√©rida in Yucat√°n in 1775, in the Viceroyalty of New Spain (colonial M√©xico). Sailing to Cuba in the spring of 1776 for his consecration, he was accompanied by much of his family and friends, including his nephew Manuel Torres. He brought with him 38 crates of books, rich ornaments, paintings, and coins. He reorganized the Colegio de San Pedro, which had fallen on hard times since the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1767. Archbishop of Bogot√° In 1777 he was named archbishop of Santa F√© de Bogot√° in the colonial Viceroyalty of New Granada by King Charles III, and confirmed by the pope. He arrived there on March 5, 1778. There he worked assiduously and successfully to pacify the rebels of the Comunero Revolt. For his services, King Charles subsequently made him a member of the Order of Carlos III and viceroy of New Granada. He did much important pastoral work. He reformed the system of tithes and founded the sees of M√©rida (Venezuela) and Cuenca (Quito). He was unsuccessful in founding a see at Antioquia and in placing the diocese of Panama under the jurisdiction of Bogot√° (instead of Lima). Neither was he able to organize a provincial council of New Granada, as he had hoped. Revolt of the Comuneros In 1780 the Revolt of the Comuneros broke out in the Viceroyalty of New Granada, almost at the same time as the revolt of T√∫pac Amaru in Viceroyalty of Per√∫. This was largely a reaction against the new system of taxes ordered by Charles III. To institute these reforms, the Crown sent Juan Francisco Guti√©rrez de Pi√±eres to the colony in 1777, with the title of visitador (inspector). He established a tobacco monopoly, prohibiting its cultivation in certain regions, such as Socorro and Chiriqu√≠ Province. He set taxes on playing cards and aguardiente, organized the tax office, and set up customs offices in Cartagena and Bogot√°. The revolt began in Simacota, and included Mestizos, Criollos and Indigenous. About 20,000 men marched on the capital to demand the repeal of the new taxes, defeating colonial troops along the way. Viceroy Manuel Antonio Fl√≥rez had left the capital for Cartagena to defend against an expected attack there by the British. Visitador Guti√©rrez de Pi√±eres was forced to flee before the Comuneros. The Audiencia and the archbishop formed a delegation to meet with the rebels. The meeting was held at Zipaquir√°, only 60 km from the capital. The rebels demanded the elimination of the new taxes and reductions in the old ones. Archbishop Caballero convinced the members of the Audiencia to accept all the terms. An agreement was reached on June 7, 1781, and the archbishop swore on the gospels to uphold it. The rebels dispersed. Nevertheless, once back in Bogot√° the Audiencia and the archbishop repudiated the agreement. The Comuneros rose again, but with less success. They were violently suppressed, and their leaders captured and executed. Viceroy of New Granada Viceroy Manuel Antonio Fl√≥rez resigned on November 26, 1781 and was replaced by Juan de Torrezar D√≠az Pimienta, governor of Cartagena. However Torrezar died on June 11, 1782, only four days after arriving in the capital. A sealed letter opened after his death directed that the new interim Viceroy of New Granada should be Archbishop Caballero y G√≥ngora. It thus fell to Caballero to pacify the viceroyalty. He promulgated a pardon granted by the king, expanded and improved the colonial army, and sent Franciscan missionaries to the affected provinces to preach peace and obedience to the king. He also requested the Crown to abolish the recent reforms, including the creation of intendencias in the colony. New Granada become the only Spanish territory in the Americas where they were not established. His efforts to modernize the viceroyalty were of great importance. He stimulated the economy, industry and the arts, and greatly assisted the Royal Botanical Expedition of 1783, under Jos√© Celestino Mutis. In 1782 and 1783 he had to deal with an epidemic of smallpox. In 1783 the interim character of his appointment was removed, and he became viceroy in his own right. In October 1784 he went to Cartagena to settle the Indian population in towns, and to suppress an Indigenous rebellion in Dari√©n and promote colonization there. The latter project was not successful. He founded new missions in Casanare and San Mart√≠n. In 1787 he asked to be relieved of his positions, and the king granted his request the following year. In 1788 he was appointed bishop of C√≥rdoba. He sailed for Spain in April 1789. In C√≥rdoba, he founded the School of Fine Arts and donated his art collection to the city. Antonio Caballero y G√≥ngora died in C√≥rdoba in 1796. The genus Gongora, a type of orchid with most species found in Colombia, was named after him.

SRFI is supported by many Scheme implementations. As such, it is an informal standard. History At the Scheme Workshop held in Baltimore, Maryland, on September 26, 1998, the attendees considered several proposals for standardized feature sets to include in Scheme implementations. Alan Bawden proposed that there be a repository for library proposals. Shriram Krishnamurthi volunteered to host the library, and Dave Mason and Mike Sperber joined him as initial editors and coordinators of the library process. The term Request for Implementation, a play on the Internet Request for Comments, was coined at the workshop, and modified to Scheme Request for Implementation by the editors. On November 1, 1998, the srfi-discuss mailing list was established which had as subscribers many major implementors of Scheme and other contributors to the language. An archive of the discussion is kept online. The SRFI website, along with the other SRFI procedures was established in late December 1998.

It existed from 1976 to 1995 and was based directly and indirectly on the tradition of the Popular Republican Movement (MRP). The CDS was one of the co-founding parties of the European People's Party, and later merged into the Democratic Force.  History  It was founded on 23 May 1976 by the merger of the Democratic Centre, Centre, Democracy and Progress, and former members of the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), the National Centre of Independents and Peasants (CNIP), and the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR). On 1 February 1978, the CDS was a founding member of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), alongside the Republican Party of Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and the Radical Party of Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber. It was the centrist and Christian democratic component of the UDF. Its leader Jean Lecanuet was the first president of the UDF confederation. It supported the UDF candidates in presidential elections: the incumbent president Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing in 1981 and the former Prime Minister Raymond Barre in 1988. Within the UDF, the CDS was the component which was the less enthusiastic about the alliance with the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) and after 1988, its leader Pierre M√©haignerie negotiated with the Socialist Prime Minister Michel Rocard to form a governmental coalition with the Socialist Party, which failed. In 1993, Gaullist Prime Minister Edouard Balladur gave CDS politicians numerous positions in his cabinet. In return, and in due to the incapacity of the UDF confederation to nominate a candidate in the 1995 presidential election, the most part of the CDS politicians supported the candidacy of Balladur. But, he was eliminated in the first round. Under the presidency of Jacques Chirac, the place of CDS in the cabinet reduced. On 25 November 1995, the CDS merged with the Social Democratic Party to form the Democratic Force, under the leadership of Fran√ßois Bayrou, founding component of the New UDF on 16 September 1998.

The main circuit basically consists of concentric rings forming electrical dipole antennas having capacitive gaps opposing each other by 180¬∞ (called Lakhovsky antennas). The circuit is fed with high voltage, high frequency, impulses from a generator, usually a Tesla coil. If set up correctly, the unit is supposed to create a broad band frequency spectrum of low amplitude, consisting of much more substantially lower and higher frequencies, from 1 Hz to 300 GHz, than those of the exciting generator, usually several 100 kHz to a few MHz from a Tesla transformer or several kilohertz from an induction coil. But the power of this broad band noise spectrum is very low. In order to create more harmonics and sub-harmonics, an additional spark gap on the secondary side has been found in some devices, being mounted directly on the antenna, or being mounted in parallel to the secondary coil.

Most of the foraging is done from the burrow system the yellow- faced pocket gophers create, pulling plants into the burrow by their roots. The burrow system consists of tunnels dug by the gophers averaging 75.8m in length and 10 to 132 cm in depth.Hickman, G. C. 1977a.

It was concluded that pocket gophers are not able to inhabit these lands because land-use practices have destabilized the habitats, eliminating both refuge and dispersal corridors. Yellow-faced pocket gophers are preyed on by small carnivorous mammals and large hawks and owls.Jones, J. K., Jr., D.M. Armstrong, and J. R. Choate. 1985. Guide to mammals of the plains states. Univ.

He served as the head men's basketball coach at Transylvania University from 1956 to 1968, the University of Alabama from 1968 to 1980, and Vanderbilt University from 1981 to 1989, compiling a career college basketball coaching record of 509‚Äì375. He was chairman of the NCAA Rules committee from 1979 to 1985 and was the president of USA Basketball from 1992 to 1996. Newton played basketball and baseball at the University of Kentucky, where he was a member of the national championship-winning 1950‚Äì51 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team led by head coach Adolph Rupp. Newton returned to his alma mater in 1989 as athletic director, serving in that role until his retirement in 2000. He was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor in 2000 and was inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. Former Kentucky coach Tubby Smith said of Newton: \\"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a better person in athletics than C.M. Newton. In all athletics, not just basketball. He had the utmost respect from people.\\" College career Born in Rockwood, Tennessee,C. M. Newton Bio at the Basketball Hall of Fame Newton was a two-sport player at the University of Kentucky, playing both baseball and basketball. As a reserve guard/forward, he was part of the Wildcats' national championship team in 1951 under legendary coach Adolph Rupp, though Newton himself averaged only 1.2 points per game.C. M. Newton Career Statistics at BigBlueHistory.com As a pitcher he helped the Wildcats baseball team reach the NCAA tournament and, after college, signed a minor league baseball contract with a New York Yankees farm system. Newton finally gave up baseball after the births of his two daughters. Coaching career Newton's coaching career spanned 30 years and three institutions. =Transylvania= By 1956, Newton had landed his first basketball coaching job at Transylvania University (then Transylvania College) in Lexington, Kentucky on a recommendation by Rupp. Newton compiled a 169‚Äì137 record at Transylvania,Kentucky House Bill 190 leading them to the 1963 NAIA Tournament. While at Transylvania he recruited the school's first black player. Newton was inducted into Transylvania's Pioneer Hall of Fame in 1992. =Alabama= In 1968, legendary football coach and athletic director Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant, who had been the coach for the University of Kentucky's football team during Newton's playing days, called Rupp looking for someone to turn around the University of Alabama's basketball program. Rupp recommended Newton, who after twelve seasons at Transylvania, left Lexington for Tuscaloosa. In twelve seasons at Alabama, Newton led the Crimson Tide to a record of 211‚Äì123. Under Newton the Crimson Tide became the only school besides the University of Kentucky to win three straight Southeastern Conference titles (1974, 1975, and 1976). Newton also guided Alabama to four NIT and two NCAA tournament berths, prompting the school to name a recruiting suite in his honor in 2006.C.M. Newton Recruiting Suite to be Dedicated Wednesday Just as he did at Transylvania, Newton recruited Alabama's first black player, Wendell Hudson, in 1969, integrating his second team in as many coaching stops. =Vanderbilt= After resigning from the University of Alabama in 1980 to become assistant commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, Newton had no intentions of coaching again until he was approached by Roy Kramer, the athletics director for Vanderbilt University. After only one year as assistant commissioner, Newton became coach of the Vanderbilt Commodores, leading them to a 129‚Äì115 mark in eight seasons and berths in the NCAA tournament in 1988 and 1989. Administrative career =NCAA Rules Committee= From 1979 to 1985, Newton served as chair of the NCAA Rules Committee. During his tenure the NCAA adopted the shot clock, the three-point line, and the coaches' box. Newton was a member of the NCAA Division I Basketball Committee, overseeing the NCAA Tournament, from 1992 to 1999, including the last two years as chair of the group. In 1998, a survey done by the San Antonio Express-News proclaimed Newton \\"the most powerful man in college basketball.\\" On March 16, 2015, former long-time commissioner of the Big East, Mike Tranghese, told Chris Russo on Sirius XM radio that Newton is the best chairman that ever served the NCAA. =University of Kentucky= In 1989, Newton's alma mater, the University of Kentucky, persuaded him to replace athletic director Cliff Hagan and help navigate the stormy waters of an NCAA probation.Newton Goes Home - Published in The New York Times Newton's first move as AD was to hire then-New York Knicks coach Rick Pitino. Three years later, the Wildcats bounced back from their probation with a core of mostly Kentucky-born players known affectionately to fans as \\"The Unforgettables.\\" The group‚Äîconsisting of Sean Woods, Deron Feldhaus, Richie Farmer, and John Pelphrey‚Äîlost to Duke in overtime of the 1992 NCAA Tournament East Regional final, a matchup many consider the greatest college basketball game ever played. Pitino would lead Kentucky to three Final Four appearances and the 1996 NCAA Championship before his departure in 1997. Newton also hired Bernadette Mattox, the university's first black women's basketball coach in 1995. In 1997, he hired Orlando \\"Tubby\\" Smith, the university's first black men's basketball coach, to replace Pitino, who had accepted a head coaching job with the NBA's Boston Celtics. Smith led the Wildcats to the NCAA Championship in his first season. On December 18, 1999, Newton was presented with the Annie Wittenmyer White Ribbon Award by the Women's Christian Temperance Union for refusing to allow alcohol advertising at university sporting events. Newton retired on June 30, 2000. In 2000, the University of Kentucky officially named its football playing field at Commonwealth Stadium, \\"C. M. Newton Field\\". As part of the renaming of the stadium to \\"Kroger Field\\" in 2017, the field itself was renamed \\"C. M. Newton Grounds\\". =USA Basketball= From 1992 to 1996, Newton served as the president of USA Basketball. It was on Newton's watch that the decision was made to allow professional basketball players to represent the United States in the Summer Olympics. This decision gave rise to the 1992 \\"Dream Team\\". Newton also served as an assistant coach under Bob Knight for the gold medal- winning 1984 United States men's Olympic basketball team.

The closest town to Colignan is called Nangiloc which is Colignan spelt in reverse. It appears that Colignan predated Nangiloc, and Colignan is thought to have been the name of a local Aboriginal leader. History Colignan and nearby localities Nangiloc and Iraak were established as soldier settlement farming areas after World War I, road access to the area being from the west via Boonoonar on what is now the Calder Highway. A Post Office opened on August 22, 1922 marking the beginning of postal services to the area. It closed in 1988. In common with many other soldier settlement areas the blocks provided were too small to be viable and most original settlers had left by the mid-1930s and were replaced by a later generation using irrigation.

The party existed from 1966 until 1976, when it merged with Centre, Democracy and Progress (CDP) to form the Centre of Social Democrats (CDS). The party's long-time leader was Jean Lecanuet. History Democratic Centre was founded on 2 February 1966 by Jean Lecanuet after his 1965 presidential campaign. It came from the merger of the Christian-democratic and centrist Popular Republican Movement (MRP) and the liberal and conservative National Center of Independents and Peasants (CNIP). Its goal was to incarnate a third way between the left-wing opposition (which was Marxist and anticlerical) and the Gaullist coalition (accused of being Eurosceptic, nationalist and authoritarian). Before the 1967 legislative election, some Christian Democrats left the party to join the Gaullist movement Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic. One year later, the CNIP left the Democratic Centre. In 1969, the party called for a \\"no\\" vote at the referendum about regionalization and Senate reform which caused the resignation of De Gaulle. At the ensuing 1969 presidential election Democratic Centre supported the candidacy of Alain Poher, chairman of the Senate. Poher reached the second round but was defeated by Georges Pompidou, a former Gaullist Prime Minister. Later in 1969 some centrists joined the presidential majority and the cabinet of Jacques Chaban-Delmas, a reforming Gaullist, and founded the Centre, Democracy and Progress (CDP) as majority of member split from the Democratic Centre. At the beginning of the 1970s there were therefore two centrist parties: the CDP, a component of the presidential majority, and the Democratic Centre, which remained in opposition. The Democratic Centre allied with the centrist Radical Party of Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber to form the Reform Movement in 1972, Nevertheless, due to the ballot system in the legislative election (the Two-round system), it concluded electoral agreements with the presidential majority in a number of constituencies in the 1973 legislative election. Finally, the Democratic Centre supported the winning presidential candidacy of Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing at the 1974 presidential election and was integrated into the presidential majority. On 23 May 1976, the Democratic Centre rejoined with the CDP to form the Centre of Social Democrats (CDS). The CDS joined on 1 February 1978 the newly founded Union for French Democracy (UDF) of Giscard d'Estaing.

The story was included in the 1975 collection Homeward and Beyond and the 1982 collection Starship, and the timeline from the latter collection places the story in the year 3115. Plot summary Trevelyan Micah, an agent of the Stellar Union's Coordination Service, is alerted to some suspicious activity on the part of Murdoch Juan, a Trader with whom Trevelyan has crossed paths before. Murdoch claims to be recruiting settlers for a newly discovered planet he calls Good Luck. However, the cost of building housing and infrastructure for the settlers would make the settlement uneconomical for Murdoch, and the equipment he is loading aboard his ship, the Campesino, seems mismatched for the planet he describes. When the Campesino sets out, Trevelyan and his alien partner Smokesmith pursue in a smaller, faster ship called the Genji. They follow Campesino to an Earthlike world a hundred light years from the remains of a supernova. Landing on the world, Trevelyan discovers that it once had a race of intelligent natives who were wiped out four centuries earlier when the supernova's radiation front passed by. Their buildings are still mostly intact, and Trevelyan realizes that that is the secret to Murdoch's plan: he won't have to build housing or other infrastructure for his settlers, because he can simply renovate the deserted native buildings. Murdoch stands to become the richest man in the Stellar Union. Trevelyan confronts Murdoch, and tells him that he must wait until archeological teams from the Stellar Union have thoroughly investigated Good Luck, probably for a century, before he can begin moving settlers in. Murdoch has a counterproposal: Trevelyan will surrender to him, and Murdoch will maroon him alone on a deserted island on Good Luck for ten years while the planet is colonized. Trevelyan responds with his final offer: Murdoch will allow him to leave Good Luck or else Smokesmith will nuke Trevelyan, Murdoch, and the Campesino. After Smokesmith sets off a sample nuke in the atmosphere above them, Murdoch agrees. Trevelyan will return to the Stellar Union and spread the word that anyone who takes up Murdoch's offer and settles on Good Luck will be forcibly removed by the Coordination Service, which should suffice to prevent settlement of the planet.

Vermeer drew the strip from July 7, 1946 to July 17, 1976; Edmund R. \\"Ed\\" Sullivan picked up the strip after Vermeer's retirement. Characters and themes The strip featured Priscilla Nutchell, a young girl who was obsessed with the idea of owning a horse, and her parents Hazel and Waldo Nutchell. Other characters in the strip were her older brother Carlyle, her two young friends Hollyhock and Stuart, and her dog Oliver. Comics historian Don Markstein described the situation: :The young school-age daughter was, of course, Priscilla. She was, in every possible way, a perfectly normal kid, outrageous only to the extent that most people that age are outrageous. It was only Waldo who got exasperated trying to deal with her. The cast was rounded out by Priscilla's friend, Hollyhock (who liked to read and consequently had a lot of general knowledge swimming around in her head), and Hollyhock's nemesis, Stuart (who doubted most of the factoids Hollyhock expressed).Toonopedia: Priscilla's Pop A constant theme of the strip was Waldo's lunch, which consisted of eating mashed potato sandwiches to save money until the mortgage was paid. Another theme was Priscilla's yearning for her very own horse. Sometime before the strip ended, money was found in the family budget to buy a horse. Waldo, however, was still eating mashed potato sandwiches.

The First Phase  The Quebec government announced plans in April 1971 for a hydroelectric project in the Baie-James region of northern Quebec. It followed typical practice of neither informing the Cree people living in the area, nor estimating the consequences of the development as far as they were concerned. The Cree decision to present a unified front in negotiations in order to protect their lands and future autonomy provided the foundation for increased contact between the different communities and the start of a regional identity for the James Bay Cree. The Quebec Association of Indians, an ad hoc association of native northern Quebecers, won an injunction on 15 November 1973 blocking the construction of the hydroelectric project. They were represented by their lawyer James O'Reilly, who became one of the foremost experts in Indian law. The day after the Malouf judgement was issued, two appeals were launched, one against the merits of the Malouf judgement and one an application to the effect that the Malouf judgement should be suspended pending the hearing. One week later the Court of Appeal of Quebec heard the case. The three judges, Lucien Tremblay, Jean Turgeron, and P.C. Casey, suspended the Malouf judgement until the Court of Appeal was ready to hear the case. In 1974 the Court of Appeal overturned the Malouf judgement. Although the judgement was suspended seven days later and overturned in 1974, the Malouf judgement confirmed Quebec's legal obligation to negotiate a treaty covering the territory, even as construction proceeded.Boyce Richardson; Strangers Devour The Land, 1975 The Grand Council of the Crees, representing the Cree villages of Northern Quebec, was created in 1974 to better protect Cree rights during negotiations with the governments of Quebec and Canada. The governments of Canada and Quebec and representatives from each of the Cree villages and the most of the Inuit villages signed the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement on November 11, 1975. The Agreement offered, for the first time, a written contract which explicitly presented the rights of indigenous people. The result of the hydroelectric treaty became an example for future conflicts in other communities with issues of the same nature. It allowed hydroelectric development on Cree lands in exchange for financial compensation, greater autonomy, and improvements to health care, housing, and educational services. The Agreement strengthened the social and political position of the Cree, but drove a split between them and other native groups by establishing what was seen as an undesirable precedent by which native land claims could be resolved. The intention of the Cree was not to 'sell out' and sacrifice a part of their Cree culture to compensate for their place in Canadian society, but to secure and uphold as much of their rooted lifestyle and land as possible, maintaining the power of their native traditions while carefully amalgamating into the economically dominant society. Even during these negotiations, construction of roads and dams for the hydroelectric projects never stopped for an appreciable length of time. The Cree had no legal way of stopping or suspending this development, so even if they had succeeded in obtaining complete recognition of their claims, much of the land would have already been flooded. They were well aware of the fact that the damage to their culture and land was inevitable, and desired reimbursement for its repair. Unfortunately, the federal and provincial governments repeatedly failed to fulfil the monetary promises made in the Agreement, and the Cree were forced to use their own compensation money for improvements, such as those to basic water and sewage systems, that would otherwise have waited a long time for a solution. The new village of Chisasibi, on the southern shore of La Grande River, replaced the Fort George settlement on an island at the mouth of the river in 1981. The Fort George settlement itself had been home to people forced to relocate by earlier hydroelectric development. The construction of first phase of the James Bay Project was completed in 1986. The Second Phase  In 1986 the Quebec government announced plans for the second phase of the project. The Grande-Baleine hydroelectric project involved the creation of three power plants and the flooding of about 1,700 square kilometres of land (3% of the Grande-Baleine watershed) upstream from the Whapmagoostui village. The Grande-Baleine project represented a source of employment for the citizens of Quebec, and an alteration to the local ecosystem to environmentalists. For the Cree and Inuit in the area, however, the project would not only cause serious change to the environment, but would also have a social impact. Attempts to estimate the social impact of the hydroelectric projects (usually included within the environmental assessment) are complicated by unresolved dilemmas such as whether the changes were caused by the project itself or if they were beginning to happen before the project came to fruition. With the Grande-Baleine project, the Cree community of Whapmagoostui found themselves facing new social changes that they had avoided up to that point. Unfortunately for the community, Hydro-Quebec and the sector of the government most involved in the project took the position that any social effects on the communities were not their problem, and would not impact decisions made regarding the project. The Cree and Inuit worked together with environmentalists to protest the development, but the debate of the Grande- Baleine project was reduced to the issue of political power (whether the Inuit and Cree were to be allowed to exercise their interests in the development and what form it would take), instead of accommodating other (non-political) interests. In 1991, under the direction of Grand Chief Matthew Coon Come, the Cree launched a very visible protest of the Grande-Baleine project in New York City. Following agreements in 1989 and 1992 with the Governments of Canada and Quebec, a new Cree village, Ouj√©-Bougoumou, was created in 1992 for the 600 Cree of the Chibougamau area. The Quebec government canceled the Grande- Baleine hydroelectric project in 1994, in part due to public concern about its potential impact on the environment and on First Nations communities. Continuing Impact  The Cree and the Government of Quebec signed the landmark Agreement Respecting a New Relationship Between the Cree Nation and the Government of Quebec, also known as La Paix des Braves, in 2002. Far more than an economic deal, this was seen as a \\"nation to nation\\" agreement. The agreement paved the way for the construction of a final element of the original James Bay Project, the Eastmain-1 power station. The Cree and the Government of Quebec signed an agreement in 2004 providing for the joint environmental assessment of the Rupert River Diversion. The Rupert River Diversion was approved in 2007 and construction began.

They have produced a variety of role-playing games, card games, and board games. Since 2003, they have published exclusively in PDF format. History Blacksburg was started by Greg Porter in 1985, in Blacksburg, Virginia. Greg had decided early on that he did not want the company to go into debt to release or promote products, so their first games saw very limited releases.http://www.geeknative.com/4003/greg-porter-e-view-echoes-16/ Its first product was a board game, Concrete Jungle, a modern tactical game of small-unit military and police actions. TimeLords was its first role-playing game product, released in 1987. It did not initially sell well, but maintained a cult following that allowed a second edition to be published in 1990, followed by a number of supplements. The 1988 release of Macho Women with Guns saw unexpected success and several printings, and allowed the company to continue and expand its line of role-playing game products. The company then focused on generic role playing game systems, first with CORPS, and followed by their flagship system EABA in 2003. With the creation of EABA, they moved to release games exclusively in PDF format, either through online download or print on demand. This allowed the Blacksburg to produce more games and continually update them without reprinting new versions every time, but also limited their reach into gaming stores and slowed sales. The move to PDF only also allows the games to use many of the built in features of the PDF format across any platform, such as automated dice rolling, live links, and mapping.

In a racing career which lasted from 1983 until 1985 she ran fifteen times and won eight races. After showing good form as a two-year-old in 1983 she won the 1000 Guineas as a three-year-old. In 1985 Pebbles produced her most notable performances, becoming the first filly to win the Eclipse Stakes and then defeating an exceptionally strong field in the Champion Stakes. On her final racecourse appearance she became the first British-trained racehorse to win a Breeders' Cup race, when she won the Breeders' Cup Turf. She was regarded as one of the greatest fillies of the modern era. Background Pebbles was a chestnut filly with a white blaze who was bred in England by the Greek shipping magnate Marcos Lemos whose blue and white colours she carried for her first seven races. Pebbles was the first foal of her dam, La Dolce, who finished fifth in the 1979 Epsom Oaks. As a descendant of the mare Aloe, she was related to such notable racehorses as Round Table, Known Fact and Parthia. Pebbles' sire, Sharpen Up, was a highly successful breeding stallion, best known as a strong influence for speed rather than stamina. Pebbles was sent into training with Clive Brittain at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1983: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1983 Pebbles finished unplaced on her first appearance and then won the Kingsclere Stakes at Newbury by four lengths. In June she ran in the Childwick Stud Stakes at Newmarket and won by three lengths from Sajeda, leading Brittain to comment that she was one of the best fillies he had trained. Pebbles was off the course for two months before being moved up in class for the Group Two Lowther Stakes at York. She finished fourth behind Prickle and Desirable, beaten four lengths. Pebbles then started favourite for the Waterford Candelabra Stakes at Goodwood but sweated badly before the race and appeared to tire in the closing stages before finishing fifth behind Shoot Clear. In the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket in September, Pebbles was made a 33/1 outsider in the twelve runner field. Ridden by Philip Robinson, she produced her best performance of the season, producing a \\"strong run\\" in the closing stages and failing by a head to catch Desirable. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best European two- year-olds, Pebbles was given a weight of 119 pounds, fourteen pounds behind the top-rated El Gran Senor and six pounds below the leading filly Almeira. =1984: three-year-old season= Pebbles began her three-year-old season in 1984 by returning to Newmarket to win the Nell Gwyn Stakes in April. She took the lead two furlongs from the finish and beat Meis-El-Reem by one and a half lengths. In the 1000 Guineas over one mile at the next Newmarket meeting, Pebbles started at odds of 8/1 behind the 6/5 favourite Mahogany, who had beaten Shoot Clear in the Fred Darling Stakes. Pebbles sweated freely and became nervous and agitated before the race: as the fillies were moving onto the course she abruptly spun round and hit a gate. In the race however, she was an emphatic winner, taking the lead in the final quarter mile and drawing steadily clear to win by three lengths from Meis-El-Reem, Desirable and Shoot Clear. Pebbles was considered a contender for the Oaks at Epsom but was purchased by Sheikh Mohammed, who already owned two of the favourites for the race. Pebbles was rerouted to Royal Ascot for the one mile Coronation Stakes in which she was matched against the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Katies. Robinson, given the choice of rides, opted to partner Katies. Pebbles took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the final furlong and beaten one and a half lengths by Katies, with the two fillies pulling well clear of their eight opponents. Brittain pointed out that the filly had been trained with the Oaks in mind and had been prepared to race over one and a half miles rather than the one mile distance. Pebbles was trained for a rematch with Katies in the Child Stakes but stood on a stone before the race and was withdrawn. The injury failed to respond to treatment and x-ray revealed a chipped bone in her foot which kept her off the course until autumn. Pebbles returned in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October. She raced over ten furlongs, the longest distance she had attempted and also competed against colts and older horses for the first time. Pebbles looked calmer than usual before the race and settled well towards the back of the field. In the closing stages she was switched to the outside and accelerated into contention before finishing second by a neck to the French-trained colt Palace Music who won in a course record time. In the International Classification for 1984, Pebbles was rated the fifth best three-year-old filly in Europe behind Northern Trick, Katies, the Oaks winner Circus Plume and the Irish Oaks winner Princess Pati. =1985: four-year-old season= Pebbles stayed in training at four and began her season by running in the inaugural Trusthouse Forte Mile at Sandown Park Racecourse in April. Ridden by Steve Cauthen, she recorded her first win in almost a year, beating Vacarme by one and a half lengths. On her next start, she was sent to Royal Ascot in June where she was matched against the 1984 St Leger winner Commanche Run, who had won the Brigadier Gerard Stakes by twelve lengths on his reappearance. Pebbles defeated the colt by a short head, but both the favourites finished behind the 33/1 outsider Bob Back. It was subsequently revealed that Pebbles had been in season at the time of her only defeat of the year. Pebbles faced Bob Back again in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown, a race which no filly or mare had won since its inception in 1886. Commanche Run was a late withdrawal from the race, but the field included the Coronation Cup winner Rainbow Quest, who started 4/5 favourite. Brittain was worried that the filly's temperament would lead her to become over-excited and deliberately brought her into the paddock late. Pebbles was then re-plated, which Brittain later admitted was a deliberate ploy to delay the race and give her time to relax. Pebbles tracked the pacemaker August until accelerating into a clear lead early in the straight. According to Timeform, she \\"never looked in the slightest danger\\" and won easily by two lengths from Rainbow Quest, who went on to win that season's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Pebbles was expected to run next in either the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes or the Budweiser Million, but for unexplained reasons, she lost her appetite after her Eclipse win and Brittain decided to rest the filly until autumn. Aqueduct Race Track, the scene of Pebbles' most valuable win. Pebbles returned for a highly anticipated renewal of the Champion Stakes. The field included the previous year's winner, Palace Music, Epsom Derby winner Slip Anchor and Commanche Run, who had won both the International Stakes and the Irish Champion Stakes, making him eligible for a $1M bonus if he added the Newmarket race. Ridden by Pat Eddery, Pebbles was restrained in the early stages before moving forward to dispute the lead a furlong from the finish. Eddery took a long look over his shoulder at the struggling opposition before allowing Pebbles to sprint clear. She was eased down in the last strides to win by three lengths from Slip Anchor, Palace Music and the Irish Oaks winner Helen Street. On her final appearance, Pebbles was sent to New York to contest the second running of the Breeders' Cup Turf at Aqueduct Race Track. Her owner paid a supplementary fee of $240,000 to run her in the $2M race, as she had not been among the original entries. Although it was the filly's first run abroad and her first over the distance of one and a half miles, she started 11/5 favourite in a field of fourteen. Pebbles missed most of the pre-race parade after Brittain bribed one of the Aqueduct staff to open a walkway, allowing her to join the other runners at the last moment. Eddery settled Pebbles at the back of the field in the early stages before moving up on the inside to take the lead early in the straight. The filly immediately went clear and held the late challenge of the Australian Champion Strawberry Road by a neck in a course record time of 2:27.00. On the strength of her single victory in the United States, Pebbles was awarded the 1985 Eclipse Award for American Champion Female Turf Horse. In the International Classification for 1985, Pebbles was the highest rated filly in Europe and the highest rated horse in the 6¬Ω to 10¬Ω furlong division. In the annual poll conducted by the Racegoers' Club, Pebbles received twenty-eight of the thirty votes to be named British Horse of the Year. She was also named Horse of the Year by Timeform. In their book A Century of Champions, Tony Morris and John Randall rated Pebbles the fourth-best British filly of the twentieth century behind Pretty Polly, Sun Chariot and Sceptre. Temperament Pebbles, in addition to her success as a racer, was known for her assorted unique quirks. She was frequently accompanied by a gelding named Come On The Blues (the winner of the Royal Hunt Cup) who exerted a calming influence on the highly strung filly and escorted her to America for the second running of the Breeders' Cup. Brittain described Pebbles as an extremely difficult horse to manage and one who could not be trained in the conventional way, noting that she spent more time swimming than galloping. She also was known for consuming a pint of Guinness a day. Retirement Pebbles was not a success as a broodmare. Despite producing foals by such prominent stallions as Nureyev, Caerleon, Green Desert and Reference Point, none of her progeny distinguished themselves as racehorses. In 1996 Pebbles was sent to the Darley Stud's Fukumitsu Farm in Japan. She was retired from breeding in 2002 and died in September 2005.

General Shuhei Fujioka is the son of Yasuhei Fujioka, also a sculptor of porcelain figurines. Since he was young, Shuhei learned the business and how to sculpt under his father. Shuhei took over the business from his father and became the second generation master sculptor during the early 1990s. Shuhei Fujioka is also the master sculptor for his own line of products under the name of \\"Precious Memory\\". Precious Memory Fujioka's company took on sales operations and a new name, Precious Memory, Inc., in the late 1990s to answer to the need for a \\"Precious Moments\\" distributor in Japan. The then president and CEO of Enesco, Corp., Eugene Freedman, was a longtime business partner and friend for both Shuhei and his father. At Freedman's request, Shuhei took on the responsibilities of distributorship in Japan. As encouragement, Enesco allowed Shuhei and his studios to sculpt a series of \\"Japan Exclusive\\" figurines. The products were given inspirational titles by Sam Butcher. Enesco decided to let Precious Memory exclusively market these products for six months before the products became available worldwide. As the Enesco era came to a close in 2005, these items were \\"retired\\". In the first decade of the 2000s, Shuhei also created his own line of products. As evident in the flagship products, \\"Memories In Eternity\\", these products celebrated Japanese history and culture. Also, other product lines were introduced under the Precious Memory brand that touched on common Asian cultures, like the Chinese zodiacs. Precious Memory and their studios have also pioneered new methods to apply glass to bisque ceramic, and also created the Natural Jade Glaze for their Yashiroyama-gama high-end tea ceremony vessels.

The museum is located in The Presidio of San Francisco, part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco. The museum retrofitted and expanded three existing historic buildings on the Presidio‚Äôs Main Post. The principal building, at 104 Montgomery Street, faces the Parade Ground, and opened on October 1, 2009. The Walt Disney Family Museum is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that was formally owned, operated and funded by the Walt Disney Family Foundation, a non-profit organization established by Disney's heirs including Diane Disney Miller, Disney's daughter and founder of the museum. It is not formally associated with The Walt Disney Company, the media and entertainment enterprise. Exhibits The Lilly Belle locomotive and several train cars from Walt Disney's Carolwood Pacific Railroad are at the museum. The 40,000 square foot space in the main museum building features the newest technology and historic materials and artifacts to bring Disney‚Äôs achievements to life, with interactive galleries that include early drawings and animation, movies, music, listening stations, and a 12-foot diameter model of Disneyland. The lobby displays 248 awards that Disney won during his career, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and many Academy Awardsincluding the honorary award for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which consists of one full-sized Oscar alongside seven miniature ones (representing the Seven Dwarfs). There is also a Fantasia-inspired state-of- the-art digital Theater on the lower level of the museum, which screens Disney films daily. There are ten permanent galleries, starting with Walt Disney's ancestral history and ending with his death on December 15, 1966.Descriptions of all ten permanent galleries Pieces related to Walt Disney's ridable miniature Carolwood Pacific Railroad (built in his backyard), including his beloved Lilly Belle locomotive, are on display at the museum as well. Critical reception This display case in the lobby shows many of the Academy Awards he won, including the distinctive special award at the bottom for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Randy Malamud of the Chronicle of Higher Education wrote, \\"It's a collection of ideas and documents, a diverse array of archival, filmic, and pop-cultural texts that historicizes Disney's work and compels us to think twice about how we appraise it. The museum energizes the fascinatingly charged scholarly debate that the Disney phenomenon has provoked, shaking the worn, staid, sometimes cynical images we have of Disney and his empire, bringing to them renewed color and motion.\\" Edward Rothstein of The New York Times wrote, \\"Given the heritage of the place, you expect to see a ride at the Walt Disney Family Museum . . . And in a way, there is one, since the museum does just what Disney thought a ride should do when he created Disneyland more than half a century ago: it tells a story. And while the museum is almost leisurely in relating its narrative, only here and there veering into uncharted terrain, and while children will quickly pass by many sections that will fascinate their elders, there are more than enough thrills for everyone.\\" See also *Rail transport in Walt Disney Parks and Resorts *Walt Disney Hometown Museum References External links * Category:2009 establishments in California Category:Art museums established in 2009 Category:Biographical museums in California Category:Cartooning museums Category:Media museums in California Category:Museums in San Francisco Category:Presidio of San Francisco Category:Walt Disney ","title":"Walt Disney Family Museum"},{"id":"8037918","text":"Day of Remembrance may refer to the following: *Day of Remembrance (Japanese Americans) (19 February), day commemorating the Japanese American internment during World War II *Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice (24 March), a commemorative day observed by Argentina *Day of Remembrance (Turkmenistan) (6 October), day commemorating the 1948 Ashgabat earthquake *Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repressions (30 October), a commemorative day observed by former Soviet countries *Transgender Day of Remembrance (20 November), a commemorative day observed by the LGBT community *Remembrance Sunday (10 November), This is held in the United Kingdom as a day to commemorate the contribution of British and Commonwealth military and civilian servicemen and women in the two World Wars and later conflicts *Remembrance Day (11 November), a commemorative day observed by many Commonwealth countries *Yom Hazikaron (4 Iyar), a commemorative day observed by Israel *National Day of Remembrance (Cambodia) (20 May), a commemorative day in Cambodia *Day of Remembrance (31 January), a commemorative day observed by NASA commemorating the loss of those in the Columbia, Challenger, and Apollo 1 incidents See also *Days of Remembrance *Remembrance (disambiguation) ","title":"Day of Remembrance"},{"id":"8037929","title":"List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves recipients (1945)"},{"id":"8037943","text":"Logierait ( - 'Hollow of the [Earth-Walled] Fort/Enclosure') is a village and parish in Atholl, Scotland.

Nearby was an ancient ash tree, the Dule Tree of the district from which thieves and murderers were hanged. Above the village is the site of a major early royal castle, perhaps the 'rath' of the place-name, still marked by a large ditch. This was probably the seat or caput of the mormaers of Atholl. The ancient promontory fort is marked by a huge 'Celtic' cross, a monument to the 6th Duke of Atholl (1814‚Äì1864). The church is of early Christian origin, as shown by the presence of two Pictish cross-slabs: one in the churchyard, discovered in or before 1878; the other, identified in 1989, in the church. Both are classified as Class II Pictish stones (dressed stones, relief carving). The church's dedication is to Coeddi, Bishop of Iona in the early 8th century, perhaps the founder of the church here. The present church building, however, dates from the early 19th century, and is protected as a category B listed building. The school dates from 1863 and was also built by the 6th Duke.

The school is part of the Gwinnett County Public Schools system. Meadowcreek High School is the most diverse secondary institution in the state of Georgia, with a student body representing over 90 different nationalities. Hispanics make up the majority with 65% of its students being of Hispanic/Latino descent. Meadowcreek's robotics team competes in FRC (First Robotics Competition) at the state level, the culinary arts team has won state and national recognition, and the Science Olympiad Team consistently ranked in the Top 4 for over six consecutive years. In 2003 and 2005, it was ranked second and went to the national competition with Parkview High School, the only other high school representing Georgia. Meadowcreek FCCLA was consistently ranked as one of the best fine arts programs in the Metropolitan area. The Model UN team was named 1st Place Outstanding Delegation in 2005 and 2nd Place Outstanding Delegation in 2006 at the Georgia State Competition, with only three years of experience. History Meadowcreek High School opened in August 1986 to relieve overcrowding at Berkmar High School and Norcross High School. It was named for the Meadows Family School and the Creek Indians, both once located near the site of the school. Today, its location at 4455 Steve Reynolds Boulevard is prime real estate, fronted by a five-lane thoroughfare a mile or so from Interstate 85. The opening of Meadowcreek High School was not without problems, including many delays in construction. Faculty and staff were unable to work in the building until the Friday before school began on Monday. Most worked all weekend to prepare for the first day of classes. The excitement and pride of being in a new facility had to be postponed for some faculty and students because the gym, theater, band and chorus rooms, and science labs were not completed when school began. Still, the newly assembled staff of 50 and the new student body, two-thirds of whom came from Berkmar and one-third from Norcross, worked at overcoming these obstacles and created a spirit of cooperation and commitment to their new home. During the first year, Meadowcreek temporarily housed 500 eighth-grade students and 20 teachers from the overcrowded Sweetwater Middle School. At the time, Meadowcreek served a unique student body made up of students representing at least a dozen cultures, nationalities and languages. One project which helped unite the students, faculty, and community, and began to give the school a sense of identity was the spring musical Li'l Abner, which involved students, teachers, parents, and others in the production. Meadowcreek students also demonstrated that they could compete with the more established schools in the county by winning in junior varsity competitions in wrestling, soccer, and football. Four county winners in the Mosaic writing competition came from Meadowcreek the first year. The school's mascot is the Mustang, and its colors are Carolina blue, navy blue, Vegas gold, silver and white. Carolina blue and white were chosen in a vote by the first student body from a variety of choices. Vegas gold, navy blue and silver were added with the establishment of Meadowcreek U in 2014. Warriors and Indians were also finalists for the mascot.Meadowcreek High School - general Building facts *The school is divided into 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 buildings. **The 1000 building is the original structure, opened in 1986. Much of the 1000 building has been modified since 1986. The old theatre from the commons was torn down to make way for the expansion of the commons. To expand the library, the main hall in the 1200 section was removed. **The 2000 building added more classrooms and computer labs. **The 3000 building also added more classrooms to relieve overcrowding. **The 4000 building was the largest of the construction projects at the school. Phase I consisted of adding more classrooms and computer labs. Phase II added new band, chorus, dance, and orchestra rooms. A new theatre, considered the best in the county, and a new athletic gym were also added. The area between the athletic gym and the theatres shares a large communal area with a concession stand.

Two bus lanes a cycle lane and four lanes for general traffic, unusually the Southbound Bus lane is in the middle of the road. The A202 is a primary A road in London. It runs from New Cross Gate to London Victoria station. A section of the route forms a part of the London Inner Ring Road between Vauxhall and Victoria, known as Vauxhall Bridge Road. No part of the route is in the London Congestion Charge zone, but the section between Vauxhall and Victoria is part of the zone's boundary, which is to the immediate west of Vauxhall Bridge Road. The A202 is managed by Transport for London (TfL) in its entirety, and is designated a London Red Route.  Route  = London Borough of Lewisham = At its eastern end, the A202 begins at a junction with the A2/New Cross Road, in the New Cross area of the London Borough of Lewisham. The A2 carries traffic eastbound towards the M25 and destinations in Kent. New Cross Gate station is situated to the east of the A202 terminus. Heading westbound, the route is named Queen's Road as it enters Peckham and the London Borough of Southwark. = London Borough of Southwark = Continuing westbound, the A202 passes along the northern rim of Nunhead as it continues towards Peckham town centre. It passes the eponymous railway station, Queens Road Peckham, as it enters the central portion of the locality. Queen's Road was formerly known as Deptford Lane. It was renamed in honour of Queen Victoria, who often passed through it on her way to the Royal Naval School at New Cross. The route is named Peckham High Street between the railway station and the road's junction with Rye Lane, after which it is named Peckham Road. St Giles Church and the Camberwell College of Arts mark the end of Peckham Road and the point at which it becomes Camberwell Church Street, and at which the route enters Camberwell. The A202 meets the A215 at a crossroads to the south of King's College Hospital, after which the route is known as Camberwell New Road. A short portion of Camberwell New Road forms the border between the Boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth. = London Borough of Lambeth = Camberwell New Road enters Lambeth at a junction with Foxley Road in Kennington. In the Lambeth, the A202 meets the A23, which runs southbound towards Brixton and Gatwick Airport (), and the A3, which links the City of London to Clapham and destinations in Surrey and Hampshire. Oval tube station is situated at the A202 junction with the A3, and A23 roads. In Kennington, the A202 runs along the southern rim of The Oval as Harleyford Road. The Oval is the home ground of Surrey County Cricket Club. As it leaves Kennington, the route enters the large Vauxhall gyratory, which encircles the Vauxhall Bus Station. As of April 2019, TfL has plans to reconfigure the gyratory and remove the bus station. The Vauxhall area is famous for its \\"gay village.\\" The Royal Vauxhall Tavern is situated on the A202 route, at the point where Harleyford Road merges with the gyratory and the nearby Kennington Lane. The A202 leaves the gyratory in a northwesterly direction over Vauxhall Bridge, the point at which it also leaves Lambeth. At this point, the A202 forms part of the London Inner Ring Road. If heading north-west, traffic travels clockwise around the Ring Road. Travelling anti-clockwise, the Ring Road leaves the Vauxhall gyratory along the A3204/Kennington Lane towards Elephant and Castle in an eastbound direction. = City of Westminster = After Vauxhall Bridge, the A202 continues northwest. The route, carried by Vauxhall Bridge Road, forms the boundary between Millbank and Pimlico. The A202's western terminus is at Victoria station. The Ring Road continues clockwise (northbound) on A302/Grosvenor Place, which leads to Hyde Park Corner.  Landmarks   Cycle Superhighway 5  Cycle Superhighway 5 (CS5) runs alongside the A202 between Kennington and Westminster. The route begins near The Oval on the 'northbound' side of Harleyford Road. CS5 runs northwest towards Vauxhall. At Vauxhall, the route crosses Kennington Lane at a signal- controlled junction, running along the eastern perimeter of the gyratory. North of the gyratory, CS5 runs as a bike freeway across Vauxhall Bridge (adjacent to the A202 southbound carriageway). On the northern side of the bridge, CS5 meets CS8 at a signposted junction. CS8 runs from Wandsworth to Lambeth Bridge, near the Houses of Parliament. CS5 continues northwards to Regency Street, where it leaves the A202 and travels towards the centre of Westminster. Cyclists may rejoin the A202 northwest towards Victoria at a signal-controlled junction at this point. South of The Oval, cyclists on the A202 meet Cycle Superhighway 7. CS7 runs alongside the A3 between Elephant and Castle and Clapham Common. The northbound terminus of CS7 is the City of London, whilst its southern terminus is in Collier's Wood. For the most part, CS5 is traffic-free and cyclists are segregated from other road traffic.

It extends for just over from an intersection with NY 30A in the town of Glen to a junction with NY 30 in the town of Florida. The route is a two-lane highway known as Mill Point Road, named for a small hamlet situated near NY 161's midpoint. At Mill Point, the road crosses Schoharie Creek. NY 161 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and has not been altered since. Route description NY 161 westbound approaching the junction with NY 30A in Glen NY 161 begins at a five-way intersection in the hamlet of Glen, located within the town of the same name. NY 30A heads southwest to northeast through the junction at a sharp angle, while Auriesville Road splits from NY 30A north of NY 161 and Logtown Road begins straight ahead from NY 161's west end. The route heads to the east as a two-lane highway named Mill Point Road, leaving the populated hamlet for more rural, open areas of the town. After crossing of rolling farmland, the highway intersects Noeltner Road by way of a Y intersection. The junction once served as the southern terminus of NY 288; however, it now marks the south end of County Route 164 (CR 164). Past Noeltner Road, NY 161 takes on a more northeasterly alignment, slowly bringing the route down the west side of a shallow valley surrounding Schoharie Creek. At the base of the gully is the small hamlet of Mill Point that gives NY 161 its name. It continues on, crossing the creek and entering the town of Florida before quickly ascending the valley's eastern face. Outside of the depression, NY 161 turns to the northeast, crossing another of rolling farmland and passing over South Chuctanunda Creek before ending at a junction with NY 30 north of the hamlet of Minaville and southwest of the city of Amsterdam. History On July 11, 1906, the state of New York let a contract for a project to improve of highway within the town of Florida to state highway standards. One of the roads improved at this time was the portion of modern NY 161 east of Denise Road. The project cost $29,072 (equivalent to $ in ) and was completed by mid-1908. The 2.74 miles of improved highway were added to the state highway system on July 1, 1908, and legislatively designated as State Highway 299. The section of modern NY 161 west of Schoharie Creek was improved to state highway standards in the early to mid-1920s, while the piece between the creek and Denise Road was rebuilt sometime after 1926. NY 161 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 161 originally extended further eastward along the current Logtown Road and terminated at NY 162 in the hamlet of Rural Grove. NY 161A NY 161A was a short spur in the town of Florida that connected NY 161 to NY 30 just north of the hamlet of Minaville by way of Youngs Corners and Dunlap Roads. The highways were state-maintained by 1926 and designated as NY 161A . The designation was removed .

It is approved by the Free Software Foundation although it has not been approved Open Source by the Open Source Initiative.  Author  The Ruby license was created on 21 December 1995 with Ruby programming language by Yukihiro Matsumoto. Matsumoto, also known as Matz, born on 14 April 1965. He is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer from Tottori Prefecture, best known as the chief designer of the Ruby programming language and its reference implementation, Matz's Ruby Interpreter (Ruby MRI). He was a self- taught programmer until the end of high school. He graduated in computer science at University of Tsukuba, where he joined the research department on programming languages and compilers. In 2006, Matsumoto was the head of the research and development department at the Network Applied Communication Laboratory, an open source systems integration company in Shimane Prefecture.  History  For versions up to 1.9.2, the ruby language has been made available under an explicit dual-licence scheme which allowed users to choose between a dedicated Ruby licence or the GNU General Public Licence v2 (GPLV2), which is one of the most common free software licences. In 2007, GNU General Public Licence v3 (GPLv3) was released. It adds rules on hardware restrictions on software modification and a clause that removes any legal value in Digital rights management, or DRM, technology, allowing end-users to bypass or remove DRM without falling foul of laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. This restrictions causes that for the language versions since 1.9.2, starting at 1.9.3, the reference implementation of Ruby has used a version of the Ruby License that includes an explicit dual-licensing clause that allows covered software to be distributed under the terms of the FreeBSD License, which, by contrast, has been confirmed as both GPL-compliant by the Free Software Foundation and as an official open source licence by the Open Source Initiative, but is far more permissive: unlike the GPL, it does not seek to enforce a 'sharealike' requirement on its licensees. The change gives developers a bit choice in what they are permitted to do with the source code, allowing those with the requisite knowledge the ability to change the underlying source to make a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù proprietary language, and redistribute it in a binary format. The Free Software Foundation comments: \\"This is a free software licence, compatible with the GPL via an explicit dual-licensing clause.\\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#Ruby  Compatibility  The Ruby License is approved by the Free Software Foundation and is considered compatible with the GNU General Public License. Debian Free Software Guidelines is a set of guidelines that the Debian Project uses to determine whether a software license is a free software license and to determine whether a piece of software can be included in Debian. Ruby license is considered a free software license by this corporation because of the integrity of the author source code, free distribution and the no discrimination, among other things. Nevertheless, the Open Source Initiative does not explicitly include Ruby license like an open source license. Anyway, the explicit dual-licensing clause of the actual version of Ruby License allows covered software to be distributed under the terms of the FreeBSD License, that the OSI accepts.Licenses approved by the OSI It's also considered \\"unnecessary\\" to be certified by OSI, because GPLv2 is already certified.  Copyleft  Copyleft is a general method to make a program (or other type of work) free, demanding that all modified and extended versions of it are also free. The Ruby License has unusual copyleft requirements, stating that redistributions should not necessarily be under the terms of the Ruby license, but placed \\"in the Public Domain or otherwise Freely Available\\". For example, a modified form of a program licensed under the Ruby license may be placed under the FreeBSD License, which is a non copyleft license, so it is permissive, and it can cause the software to become private.  Projects under Ruby License  The Ruby License is a license applied to the Ruby programming language and also available to be used in other projects. Some of these projects are projects based on Ruby programming Language. JRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language atop the Java Virtual Machine. It distributes some additional libraries that are not covered by JRuby's license, like most files found in src/lib/ruby/1.8, which are distributed under Ruby license. MacRuby is an implementation of Ruby 1.9 directly on top of Mac OS X core technologies such as the Objective-C runtime and garbage collector, the LLVM compiler infrastructure and the Foundation and ICU frameworks. MacRuby contains code from the Ruby project and the source code of the most MacRuby examples, unless specified, are covered by the Ruby license. RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a \\"gem\\"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. IronRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language targeting Microsoft .NET framework. It is implemented on top of the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), a library running on top of the Common Language Infrastructure that provides dynamic typing and dynamic method dispatch, among other things, for dynamic languages. Software under Ruby license (including the older version when GPLv2 was a listed alternative Ruby 1.9.2 license) may be included in binary form within an Apache product if the inclusion is appropriately labeled.

On 1 January 2007, it became part of the new Vordingborg municipality. It is to the east of Stege and 15 km south-west of M√∏ns Klint. As a result of the growing popularity of holiday homes, many of which are available for rental, it has developed rapidly over the past 30 years. History =The beginnings= At dusk, summer 2008. The history of M√∏n dates back many thousands of years with traces of tribes living from hunting and fishing in the area. By about 3000 BC, in the neolithic period, the inhabitants built farming settlements throughout the island and created the first ancient monuments in the form of graves or barrows built of huge stones, one of which can be found near R√•bymagle, \\\\- Brochure, in Danish, on ancient burial monuments with map. Retrieved 22 November 2006. just a couple of kilometers from R√•bylille Strand. There are also several burial mounds in the area. Much fuller accounts of the history of the area can be found in the articles on M√∏n and History of Denmark. =Recent history= The hamlet of R√•bylille, 2 km north of R√•bylille Strand, consists of a few thatched cottages, some dating back to the 17th century. A few similar cottages as well as some larger farmhouses were built closer to the coast when R√•bylille Strand was simply just the beach for R√•bylille. After the end of World War II, plots of land became available for holiday homes or summer houses as they are known in Denmark. These proved increasingly popular, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, with the result that today there is a quite network of unsurfaced roads, each flanked by small or medium-sized wooden chalets and their gardens. The names of the roads in R√•bylille Strand may appear rather curious. In fact, they are all based on the Danish terms for the components of a sailing ship. Local services R√•bylille Strand ‚àí Looking down to the beach in spring R√•bylille Strand is served by a regular bus service from Stege which in turn has services to Vordingborg where there is a railway station. It has a German bakery and two bed and breakfast establishments. Within a radius of 6 km, there are two historic churches (Keldby and Elmelunde), a supermarket, a golf course and a camping ground. In season, there are a number of roadside stalls selling fresh produce such as new potatoes, strawberries, honey and herbs. Television reception is rather limited (to Denmark's main public channels) but many houses are equipped with satellite receivers. Mobile phone reception can be difficult in parts of the community. Broadband Internet connections are not always possible due to R√•bylille Strand's distance from the nearest relay station in Kelby but service is improving. Tourism Marshland draining channel The main attraction is of course the beach itself which, facing south, enjoys all-day sunshine. The sea is fairly shallow, making it ideal for bathing, boating and fishing. Signposted walks and cycle routes pass through the area. It is within a few minutes drive of historic Stege, the white chalk cliffs of M√∏ns Klint, the beautiful park of Liselund, and the fishing village of Klintholm Havn. There are several arts-and-crafts workshops in the neighbourhood, with exhibitions of ceramics, glass, sculptures, jewelry and paintings. Of particular interest is the old farm museum, Museumsg√•rden, on the road from R√•bylille Strand to Keldbylille. In this 19th-century thatched farmhouse, you can see what farming and living conditions were like in former times. Environment East M√∏n is a quiet, hilly area with mixed farming. To the east, the ground rises to the wooded natural park which leads to the chalk Cliffs of M√∏n. The climate is sufficiently warm in the summer for a vineyard near R√•bylille Strand but winters can be cold, wet and snowy. There are many varieties of land and sea birds, particularly swallows, pheasants and swans, while wild deer, squirrels, hares and foxes are among the animal species you are most likely to see. Until the 1960s, the area where most of the holiday homes now stand was marshland. The water was drained away through a series of ditches and channels connected to a powerful pumping station. At the same time, a three-meter high dyke was constructed along the seafront to prevent flooding. Some of the marshland still exists and has become a bird sanctuary. Winter sunset over R√•bylille Strand Climate M√∏n has a relatively mild climate compared to the rest of Denmark. Data from Denmark's Meteorological Institute \\\\- DMI average weather conditions for SW Zealand, Lolland and Falster.

The summer days are long and bright with about 17 hours of daylight while in the winter, the days are short and often quite dull. In view of the shallow depth of the Baltic, the temperature of the sea can rise to about 20 ¬∞C in the summer months. And during exceptionally cold winters, partly as a result of the low salinity of the Baltic, the seawater has also been known to freeze.

Biography Pollock was born on December 25, 1902 in Denver, Colorado. He was the eldest of five brothers born to Stella May McClure and LeRoy Pollock. His father, who was born as a McCoy, had taken the surname of his parents' neighbors, who adopted him after his own parents died within a year of each other. In 1926 Pollock moved to New York to study painting. In 1930, he and another brother, Frank, persuaded their brother Jackson to join them there, effectively launching his own artistic career. In 1935, he moved to Washington, D.C. to work with the Resettlement Administration. Two years later he took a job as a political cartoonist for the United Automobile Workers' newspaper in Detroit, Michigan. From 1938 to 1942 Pollock supervised Mural Painting and Graphic Arts for the Federal Arts Project (WPA) in Michigan. After visiting Michigan State University in 1942, he joined the faculty in the Art Department, where he would teach for the next two decades. Artistic style Charles Pollock's career as a painter is sharply divided into two periods. Until the mid 1940s, Pollock followed the social realist movement, studying under Thomas Hart Benton at the Art Students League of New York. Pollock was inspired by the works of the Mexican Mural Renaissance, particularly the works of Diego Rivera and Jos√© Clemente Orozco. During the Great Depression and the New Deal era of the 1930s, Pollock began working for the Resettlement Administration, alongside fellow Social Realist Ben Shahn, supervising murals through the Midwestern and Southern United States. Pollock was then selected as supervisor of the mural painting and graphic arts division of the Federal Art Project at the WPA, settling in Detroit, Michigan. Charles Pollock abandoned social realism in the 1940s, and turned to abstract expressionism and color field painting. Some attribute the shift to the influence of his famous brother Jackson, although Charles Pollock painted in a very calm and organized manner unlike Jackson's drip painting style. Legacy Pollock had painted public works projects for the Michigan State University in the early 1940s, when it was then Michigan State College; three of his murals can be seen in the Fairchild Theatre foyer. A collection of Pollock's later abstract expressionist works are housed in Paris, the city where Pollock died in 1988. The Smithsonian American Art Museum also houses dozens of works by Charles Pollock.

In 2019, it was renamed to Morecambe Bay Academy during the process of becoming an academy. Admissions There are approximately 1500 pupils. It is situated just off the A589. History =Grammar school= The Ward family donated the land to Lancashire county council. The main school building is an art deco construction containing the administration area, school hall, dining facilities, and gym as well as the English, Maths and Science faculties, two Design Technology workshops and the RE department. In the 1930s there were around 300 boys and girls, 400 in 1938, 650 in 1942, 500 in 1953, and 850 in 1964. During the 1960s and 1970s two ROSLA blocks (which currently house Art, Drama, Music and PSE). In the late 1960s, the Department of Education and Science chose the school (along with the Rosebery School for Girls) to build an experimental sixth form centre. =Comprehensive= In September 1973 Morecambe Grammar School amalgamated with Euston Road Secondary Modern on the Dallam Avenue site to form Morecambe High School, growing considerably since the amalgamation. There were 1150 boys and girls with 240 in the sixth form. In 1992, some unused land was sold to provide funding for construction of a Sports Hall. The Sports Hall was opened by former rugby union player Bill Beaumont. This facility has its own climbing wall and a large storage area for the equipment used for Outdoor Pursuits. The site extends to some of playing fields including rugby, football and hockey pitches and an all weather surface. In the mid-1990s the school expanded to its current size of 1500. To accommodate this growth 12 new classrooms were built to house the Humanities and Languages faculties. In addition there is a dedicated Sixth Form block including a common room, teaching areas and the Media Studies studios. In 2002 the Lawther Library was opened, which was funded in large part by a donation by Professor Patrick Lawther, a former student of the school. The 300 square metres study area includes a computer resource area and the Careers Library. Recent developments In early 2009 the schools new multi use sports area opened giving it four new netball courts or five tennis courts. A new Technology Block opened in October 2007. New rooms cover areas such as manufacturing, CAD/CAM and textiles. At the beginning of the 2006/7 school year, the school introduced a house system. This saw pupils in years 8‚Äì11 assigned to a House, one of Coniston, Helvellyn, Langdale, and Scafell mostly named after Lakeland hills. Each House consists of 10 forms. The school was awarded specialist status in 2007 for specialist status in maths and computing. The schools main recent improvements are in ICT.

Not realising that the Royal family always went to sleep during the performances, Graeme is horrified to find them asleep and prods them awake. The result of actually seeing the performances makes them demand another show.

Purpose  Preservation breeding can have several purposes: # Protection of genetic diversity within a species or a breed; # Preservation of valuable genetic traits that may not be popular or in fashion in the present, but may be of great value in the future; # Population or re- population of an area where a species previously existed; # Support of a wild population that is defective or infected, by breeding healthy individuals and releasing them into the population in order to strengthen the overall health of the population.  Mechanism  Preservation breeding can take the following forms: # Selective breeding of rare breeds and rare pedigrees, particularly monitoring breeding genetics in small populations to ensure diversity is maintained as much as possible; # Rare breeds that suffer life- threatening genetic deficiencies can be intentionally cross-bred with other breeds that have the critical gene, in order to preserve the rare breed into the future;  History  The term preservation breeding was first used by notable American Kennel Club Judges Douglas Johnson and Bill Shelton in breeder seminars for dog breeders in the early 2000s.

Engraver and sculptor Sievier showed an early talent for drawing, and studied under John Young and Edward Scriven, before attending the Royal Academy Schools from 1818. His speciality was portrait engravings, though he also did other works, including subjects from William Etty (whose portrait he also engraved).Sievier, Robert William (1794-1865) By 1823, however, he had abandoned engraving for sculpture. His sculpture portrait subjects included Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Sir Thomas Lawrence (the latter work now in the Sir John Soane's MuseumThe Collections). His students included William F Woodington and Musgrave Watson. Sievier exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1822 until 1844, and his output there included several busts, figure subjects, gravestones and monuments.

In 1837 he came third in the competition to design a monument to Nelson in Trafalgar Square, with a proposal devised jointly with the architect Charles Fowler. Inventor In 1836, Sievier patented a process for rubberising fabrics and formed a ‚Äòpatent‚Äô company (the London Caoutchouc Company - caoutchouc being the original name for India rubber). The company became large-scale manufacturers of elastic driving bands for machinery, rope for mines, waterproof cloths and garments, and waterproof canvas, as well the first rubber-insulated wire.History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - Distant Writing by Steven Roberts His interests in manufacturing took over from the early 1840s onwards. Sievier's factory was situated close to his home, the Old Manor House, in Upper Holloway, at the south corner of Red Cap Lane (later Elthorne Road). Sievier also carried out experiments in electrical telegraphy there. The house was demolished in 1897. In Mar 1841 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He died in Kentish Town, London and is buried there in Kensal Green Cemetery.

Starting from a poor Italian background in Brooklyn, he eventually became chairman of Della Femina Travisano & Partners, an agency which he founded with Ron Travisano in the 1960s. Over the next two decades they grew the company into a major advertising house that was billing $250 million per year and had 300 employees and offices in both New York and Los Angeles. Della Femina is known for his larger-than-life personality and colorful language, and was referred to as a \\"'Madman' of Madison Avenue\\". In 1970, he wrote a book about the advertising industry, humorously titled, From Those Wonderful Folks Who Gave You Pearl Harbor: Front-Line Dispatches from the Advertising War. The book became a best-seller, described by The Guardian as \\"one of the defining books about advertising\\", and eventually inspired the television series Mad Men. Biography Della Femina was born into a working- class family in Coney Island, Brooklyn. His father, Michael, was a composing room employee for The New York Times. Della Femina graduated from Lafayette High School and attended one year of night school at Brooklyn College.Della Femina, Jerry, (1978). An Italian Grows in Brooklyn (1st ed.). Little, Brown. . In 1952, at age 16, he worked as a delivery boy for the Ruthruff and Ryan advertising agency. He also worked at The New York Times as a messenger boy, dropping off proofs at advertising agencies. He tried unsuccessfully in 1954 to get into advertising himself and was repeatedly rejected until in 1961, when he landed a job as a copyeditor at Daniel & Charles, then worked through multiple other agencies. He worked for two and a half years at Delehanty, Kurnit & Geller, and then became a creative supervisor at Ted Bates Advertising. Della Femina Travisano & Partners In 1967, he started his own agency, Della Femina Travisano & Partners, founding it with Ron Travisano, an advertising supervisor he had met while working as a copyeditor at Delehanty, Kurnit & Geller. Della Femina owned one-third, Travisano owned one-third, and the rest was distributed among two other partners whom they had known from DKG and had followed them to Ted Bates Advertising. Della Femina was chairman, and Travisano was vice-chairman and co-director of creative services. Their first account was for Squire, a company that made hairpieces, and they came up with an ad, \\"Are you still combing your memories?\\" In 1970, they won their first major account, for Blue Nun Wine, and came up with a campaign that used the talents of comics Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. The agency was also known for its work on Isuzu (creating the fictional spokesman Joe Isuzu), Beck's Beer, Chemical Bank, Dow Brands (Fingerman), and Pan Am. Their most famous campaign was the Meow Mix Theme, conceived by Ron Travisano and composed by David Lucas of Lucas/McFaul, which featured an apparent singing cat. In 1981, they won the account for the New York Mets, marking the first time a Major League Baseball team had hired an ad agency. By 1985, when Travisano sold his shares and left the agency, they had around 300 employees in New York and Los Angeles were still privately held and were billing approximately $250 million annually. Later agencies Della Femina sold the agency in 1986 to a British group, WCRS, for a reported $30 million USD, though he continued working at the company. WCRS was then sold to a French ad agency group, Eurocom. Della Femina was not happy with the loss of control, left in June 1992, and started a new agency, Jerry, Inc., in December of that year. Accounts included the New York Mets, Newsweek, Marvel Comics, and Financial Security Assurance. He merged it in May 1994 with the New York office of Ketchum Advertising, forming Jerry & Ketchum, with new clients including North Shore University Hospital. The name later changed to Della Femina/Jeary and Partners. Personality A self- styled \\"publicity slut\\", Della Femina made colorful comments throughout his career that made headlines. His book From Those Wonderful Folks Who Gave You Pearl Harbor (1971) was a best-seller. The title refers to a tongue-in cheek slogan proposed for the client Panasonic during a brainstorming session. USA Today described him as \\"the most colorful creative guy in an industry full of colorful creative guys\\". Restaurateur He ran a restaurant, Della Femina, in East Hampton, until he sold it in early 2011, because, \\"I‚Äôm just not ready to have my wealth redistributed. I‚Äôm not ready to pay more tax money than the next guy because I provide jobs and because I work a 60-hour week and I earn more than $250,000 a year. So why am I dropping out? Read a brilliant book by Ayn Rand called Atlas Shrugged, and you‚Äôll know.\\" Current projects He currently co-publishes the regional weekly newspaper The Independent based in East Hampton, New York. Accolades He received honorary doctorates from the University of Missouri in 1983 and from Long Island University in 1989. Advertising Age named him one of the \\"100 most influential advertising people of the century\\". Personal life Della Femina has been married to journalist and television host Judy Licht since 1983. They met in 1981 when she interviewed him for Channel 5. They have two children, now adults. Della Femina also has three grown children by a previous marriage: Donna, Michael, and Jodi.

It was a member of the Coalition of Essential Schools and uses a project-based learning curriculum. History The land where Nathan Hale High School is located today was previously occupied by the Fisher Dairy Farm and later the Meadowbrook Golf Course. At that time, Jane Addams was the only secondary school in the area and was part of the Shoreline School District. Nathan Hale High School opened in 1963 with 1,206 students, all sophomores and juniors, and grew to 2,400 students across three grades by the end of the decade. In 1969, unknown individuals painted a Raider on the school's smokestack in the middle of the night. The school radio station, KNHC (for \\"Nathan Hale Communications\\"), was founded in 1971. A learning resource center was added in 1972 using bond funds. The first greenhouse was built in 1973 to house horticulture classes, and carpentry students built a newer solar greenhouse in 1982-83, near a sewer plant that was later redeveloped into Meadowbrook Pond in the late 1990s. Nathan Hale's enrollment dropped dramatically after the district-wide 1978 desegregation plan closed or reassigned many of its feeder schools. The school began admitting ninth graders in 1979. New sports fields were added in 2000 and a new performing arts center was completed in 2005, hosting a free concert by Rihanna a few months later. =Renovations= The original building underwent a major renovation between 2009 and 2011 as part of Bex III, rebuilding 75% of the school and adding a new library and synthetic turf football field. The new building was designed with CES principles in mind and won an AIA National Award in 2014. The old smokestack was demolished during the renovation, but part of it was saved and moved to the south entrance in 2013. In 2015, the old greenhouses were demolished to make way for redevelopment of Thornton Creek, and a new greenhouse was opened behind Jane Addams Middle School in 2016. Programs and facilities Ninth grade academies have existed at Nathan Hale for several decades. They organize students into block classes with a reduced student‚Äìteacher ratio in health, science, language arts, and social studies. Beginning with the 2018-19 school year, tenth graders take block classes in humanities, art, biology, and career/technical education. Seniors complete a year-long Hale Action Project as a graduation requirement. Nathan Hale has a 17,000 square foot performing arts center, and its sports facilities include a football field, two gyms, and a weight room. Students use Jane Addams Middle School's soccer field, and swimming classes meet at the Meadowbrook Pool. Nathan Hale has hosted a vocational horticulture program since the 1970s, offering school year and summer classes through Seattle Skills Center. Student activities Nathan Hale is home to student-run radio station KNHC. Nathan Hale's journalism class produces the Sentinel, the school newspaper, which won first place with special merit from the National Scholastic Press Association in 1999. Music performance ensembles at Nathan Hale include Jazz band, Vocal Jazz, Concert Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra, Concert Choir and Wind Ensemble The theater department produces an annual fall play and spring musical. Bilingual students belonging to the Hale Ambassadors program attend school events to orient families and provide translation. Community partnerships Nathan Hale High School has a Teen Health Center run by Kaiser Permanente that provides free care to students. Nathan Hale also works with neighboring Jane Addams Middle School to improve the transition from middle school to high school for students. Sports Nathan Hale is a member of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA). The school has been in the second largest classification, known as 3A, since the 1984-85 school year. It was previously in the largest classification. The Raiders are a member of the Metro League and Sea-King District. The school supports 16 WIAA activities, including baseball, boys' and girls' basketball, cheer, cross country, football, golf, gymnastics, boys' and girls' soccer, softball, coed swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling. Three non-WIAA sanctioned sports are also fielded: boys' lacrosse, girls' lacrosse, and ultimate. The boys' lacrosse team was founded in 1992, making Hale the first public high school in Seattle to have a field lacrosse team. In 2016, former NBA star Brandon Roy was hired as the head basketball coach, and top recruit Michael Porter Jr., as well as his brothers Jontay and Coban, transferred to the school when their father, Michael Porter Sr., became the assistant coach at the University of Washington. This led to the school becoming nationally relevant, including a national #1 ranking on maxpreps.com. The basketball team completed the 2016-17 season undefeated, defeating Garfield High School 68-51 in the class-3A state championship game in Tacoma, Washington. That season the boy's basketball team traveled to Oregon to play in the Les Schwab Invitational which they won. The girls' ultimate team were national champions in 2018.

It is very similar to the Beale number where a larger number indicates higher performance; however, the West number includes temperature compensation. The West number is often used to approximate of the power output of a Stirling engine. The average value is (0.25) for a wide variety of engines, although it may range up to (0.35),http://www.bekkoame.ne.jp/~khirata/academic/simple/simplee.htm particularly for engines operating with a high temperature differential. The West number may be defined as: : W_n = \\\\frac{Wo}{PVf} \\\\frac{T_\\\\text{H} + T_\\\\text{K}}{T_\\\\text{H} - T_\\\\text{K}} = B_n \\\\frac{T_\\\\text{H} + T_\\\\text{K}}{T_\\\\text{H} - T_\\\\text{K}} where: * Wn is the West number * Wo is the power output of the engine (watts) * P is the mean average gas pressure (Pa) or (MPa, if volume is in cm3) * V is swept volume of the expansion space (m3, or cm¬≥, if pressure is in MPa) * f is the engine cycle frequency (Hz) * TH is the absolute temperature of the expansion space or heater (kelvins) * TK is the absolute temperature of the compression space or cooler (kelvins) * Bn is the Beale number for an engine operating between temperatures TH and TK When the Beale number is known, but the West number is not known, it is possible to calculate it. First calculate the West number at the temperatures TH and TK for which the Beale number is known, and then use the resulting West number to calculate output power for other temperatures. To estimate the power output of a new engine design, nominal values are assumed for the West number, pressure, swept volume and frequency, and the power is calculated as follows:ornl-tm-10475 :W_o = W_n PVf \\\\frac{T_\\\\text{H} - T_\\\\text{K}}{T_\\\\text{H} + T_\\\\text{K}} For example, with an absolute temperature ratio of 2, the portion of the equation representing temperature correction equals 1/3. With a temperature ratio of 3, the temperature term is 1/2. This factor accounts for the difference between the West equation, and the Beale equation in which this temperature term is taken as a constant. Thus, the Beale number is typically in the range of 0.10 to 0.15, which is about 1/3 to 1/2 the value of the West number.

The Book Previous readers of Noon will be in familiar territory, the book is set in the near future of Manchester 2002, and the drugs as music metaphor is the essence of the novel. Eschewing conventional punctuation, capitalisation and grammar, the book reads as if it is a series of song lyrics. The book also traces the history of pop music in Manchester, starting with skiffle in 1957, running through the sixties, before coming to an angry explosion with the punk of 1977 and the Buzzcocks. This love for music is also expressed by the names of the streets. Poking fun at the increasing excesses taken towards marketing our heritage, Manchester streets have been renamed after Mancunian bands and musicians. So we are given Ian Curtis Boulevard, a street called Gerald, Bee Gees Avenue and even Northern Uproar cul-de-sac. This was Noon's farewell book to Manchester, before he moved to Brighton, and, for the time being, seems to be the last set in the Vurt/Manchester universe.

Novempopulania (Latin for \\"country of the nine peoples\\") was one of the provinces created by Diocletian (Roman emperor from 284 to 305) out of Gallia Aquitania, which was also called Aquitania Tertia. The area of Novempopulania was first named Aquitania, as it was here where the original Aquitani dwelt primarily. The territory extended within the triangular area outlined by the River Garonne, the Pyrenees and the ocean, as described by Caesar in De bello gallico for Gallia Aquitania. In his work, Caesar describes the Aquitania as being different in language and body make-up from their northerly neighbours and more similar to the Celtiberians. The province of Aquitania was enlarged by Augustus, and it began to signify a larger and more diverse territory. Creation and evidence Novempopulania stands for the nine peoples making up the original territory (Aquitania Tertia). It seems clear that at the time of the lower empire (2nd to 4th century), Article in French and Basque the nine peoples were granted by the emperor the detachment from the proper Gauls (Celts) by means of the magister pagi Verus Flamen Dumvir, and as a result a celebrating altar was erected dedicated to the deity of the pagus. This fact is accounted for by the remains of the altar unearthed in the current Basque town of Hasparren. The newly acquired status may have affected not only the tax system but the conscription and military order too, since two separate bodies were created within Aquitania, i.e. the \\"Cohortes Aquitanorum\\" for old Aquitanians and \\"Cohortes Aquitanorum Biturigum\\" for those of proper Gaul origin. The number of peoples went on to be twelve later, the tribes being identified with a corresponding capital town or civitas, namely Civitas Ausciorum, Civ. Aquensium, Civ. Lactoratium, Civ. Convenarum, Civ. Consorannorum, Civ. Boatium, Civ. Benarnensium, Civ. Aturensium, Civ. Vasatica, Civ. Turba, Civ. Illoronensium, Civ. Elusatium. These civitas are in turn identifiable with present-day towns and cities as follows: Auch, Dax, Lectoure, Comminges, Couserans, Buch and Born, B√©arn or Lescar, Aire- sur-l'Adour, Bazas, Tarbes, Oloron, Eauze. Elusa (Eauze) remained the capital city of Novempopulania throughout most of its existence. Wide evidence of slab engravings have been found scattered all over the area comprising Novempopulania. These recordings feature names of deities, persons and places with easily identifiable similarities to present-day Basque, a fact that provides along with current and ancient place-names north of the Pyrenees (e.g. Illiberris mentioned by Ptolemy on the eastern fringes of Novempopulania) and traces of Basque in the Gascon (especially in the B√©arnese dialect) the basis for an Aquitanian proto-Basque theory. Early Middle Ages In 418, in the stir of the crumbling Roman rule and its territories overrun by Germanic tribes, Emperor Honorius allocated Aquitania to the Visigoths as foederati, with their tribes settling on the fringes of Novempopulania at both banks of the River Garonne as far south as Toulouse, where they established their seat. Other than this, their power tenure over Novempopulania may have been more nominal than real. Furthermore, after the 507 Battle of Vouille they were expelled from the area by the Franks. In the early Middle Ages, accounts of events taking place at this time on the territory are confusing and blurred, and so are the names of the peoples and their geographical location, who are as of now dubbed Vascones, Wasconia, Guasconia (as opposed to the Spanoguasconia, according to the Ravenna Cosmography) with no clear boundaries. At this point, Vascones had taken on an extended meaning arguably encompassing all Basque language tribes, different from the more restricted definition provided at the time of Augustus. The crisis at the end of the Ancient Age and outset of the Middle Ages brought about much unrest and turmoil in the Novempopulania, where the bagaudae and Vascon raids later are often mentioned in different documents. The Novempopulania was to become the core region of the Duchy of Vasconia, established by the Franks at the beginning of the 7th century with a view to holding back the Basques, while often conducting a semi-autonomous governance of Basque-Aquitanian background. It later split into the Duchy of Gascony and the County of Vasconia.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds usually in groups of three, white or creamy white flowers and ribbed, oval or bell-shaped fruit. Description Angophora costata is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth pinkish or cream-coloured bark that weathers to grey and is shed in small scales. It is the only Angophora to have smooth bark on the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, elliptical to egg-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs with a stem-clasping base, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, glossy green but paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with usually three buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to globe-shaped, up to long and wide. There are five sepals up to long and the petals are white to creamy white with a green keel, long and wide. Flowering occurs from October to December. The fruit is a oval or bell-shaped capsule up to long and wide. Taxonomy and naming The Sydney red gum was first formally described in 1788 by Joseph Gaertner and given the name Metrosideros costata in his book De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum. In 1916, James Britten changed the name to Angophora costata in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. In 1986, Gregory John Leach described three subspecies in the journal Telopea and two names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: ** Angophora costata (Gaertn.) Britten subsp. costata has a glabrous floral cup and fruit mostly less than wide; ** Angophora costata subsp. euryphylla L.A.S.Johnson ex G.J.Leach has a hairy floral cup and fruit more than wide. The third subspecies, subsp. leiocarpa is regarded as a synonym of Eucalyptus leiocarpa. Recent genetic work has been published showing Angophora to be more closely related to Eucalyptus than Corymbia, and the name Eucalyptus apocynifolia has been proposed for this species if it were to be placed in the genus Eucalyptus.Brooker, M.I.H. (2000), A new classification of the genus Eucalyptus L'Her. (Myrtaceae). Australian Systematic Botany 13(1): 135 Distribution and habitat Angophora costata grows in sandy soil, often over sandstone and occurs naturally in Queensland and New South Wales. It is widely distributed in south-eastern Queensland and disjunctly in the White Mountains National Park. In New South Wales it mainly occurs in coastal areas south from Coffs Harbour to Narooma and as far west as the Blue Mountains. In Victoria it is a commonly planted ornamental and is naturalised in some places. Use in horticulture Smooth- barked apple grows well in a variety of situations and can be easily grown from seed in a loose, well-drained seed-raising mixture. Some specimens have straight trunk but others have a more branching habit with twisted trunks. The tree sometimes sheds branches and should not be planted close to buildings.  Significant individuals  Angophora Reserve in the Sydney suburb of Avalon was named after a huge individual, reportedly around 300 years of age. That tree died in the late 20th century. Also in Sydney, the upper Lane Cove River Valley has several large Sydney red gums, one near Conscript Pass was measured at 45 metres tall. The largest known living tree in New Zealand (241 cm diameter) is located at Hobsonville near Auckland.

He was signed to Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records briefly but was incarcerated soon after. Before signing he had spent time with various other labels, featured on numerous songs and had already generated quite a buzz due to prominent beefs, appearances on mixtapes and Smack DVD. He was released from prison in 2016. He has since actively protested his innocence, and stated that he pleaded guilty to a criminal charge only because of the situation being effectively stacked against him in such a way that he felt he could not win a trial, despite the fact that he didn't participate in any crime. In his eyes, it was a better choice to plead guilty and accept the sentence than to risk a trial, which would have not only put him at risk of being convicted of a more serious crime but also at risk of a much longer sentence. He has also indicated since his release that he is a changed man and has left his previous life of crime and drama long behind him and is moving on in a positive direction. Soon after his release Tru Life featured on a song with Rick Ross which was received well. The music video for the song, released on YouTube, gathered over 1 million views within one month. As of January 2017 Tru Life has featured on a few mixtape tracks but has not released a single. In 2017, he announced that he has signed a deal with American rapper Future's Freebandz record label, under the aegis of Sony's Epic Records. Career Tru Life's career started in 1999 after being signed to Dreamworks Records. His album, Cryin' Out Loud, was scheduled to be released in November 2001. In an interview, Tru Life says \\"They weren't ready to do black music\\", and \\"there were too many bumps in the road, and I couldn't move.\\" He eventually landed an audition with Jay-Z. After more than ten minutes, Tru Life was able to convince Jay-Z of his skills, which prompted Jay-Z to reply \\"Somebody, get this kid in front of a camera!\\". He was signed to a six-figure record deal later that evening.Ogunnaike, Lola (2005) \\"Jay-Z, From Superstar to Suit \\", New York Times, August 28, 2005 Tru Life gained a significant amount of notice when he made an original song \\"Wet Em Up\\" for Grand Theft Auto IV's fictional radio station \\"The Beat 102.7\\", which was used in the Playboy X trailer released weeks prior to the game. In 2009 Tru Life stated that after a break of around 1 and 1/2 years he was getting back into music and mentioned that he was earlier signed to Def Jam but personally asked Jay-Z to get him off Def Jam, which he did, before signing him to Roc La- Familia, a subsidiary of his main label Roc-A-Fella. Tru Life had a feud with Mobb Deep that was documented in the film Beef.\\"Rapper Tru Life Lands Deal With Roc La Familia\\", Worldwideconnected.com He also has a 'beef' with Dipset, in which Tru Life depicted Dipset's Jim Jones wearing a Borat-style mankini; Jones' affiliates retaliating by hacking Tru Life's MySpace page and putting up a similar picture of Tru Life.Sunday, Billy (2007) \\"Tru Life Lost \\", XXL Magazine\\"Now, New York Rappers Beef Via Photoshop\\", New York Magazine, 2007 Since coming out of prison in 2016 Tru Life has stated he is done with any beefs or feuds he had in the past. He is of the opinion that he has been through so much in his life that the old rivalries he was once engaged in now seem meaningless. Before and after going to prison Tru Life has always been a conscious observer of his own life as well as rap music, street life and gang culture in general, and made a point of not glamorising a criminal lifestyle, being in a gang, or going to prison. Since his release from Prison Tru Life has said that whilst he has a good relationship with Jay-Z, he is not signed to him any more nor associated with him as far as his business goes, instead choosing to remain independent and using his own sharply honed business skills and the experience and skills he gained from Jay-Z to begin to forge his own brand, establish his own label. In 2017, Tru Life signed to Future's Freebandz label imprint. Tru Life had known Future when he went by Meathead and had not garnered a label deal.http://thesource.com/2016/06/28/ny-rapper-tru-life-on- the-breakfast-club-theres-nothing-cool-about-prison/ Tru Life celebrated the signing on an Instagram Live video where he ate Fruity Pebbles cereal with Ros√© champagne substituted for milk, a trademark of Tru Life's persona.http://forbezdvd.com/tru-life-signs-to-future-freebandz-label-tru- yellin-free-band-gang/ June 2009 assaults On June 15, 2009, Jason Gray also known as Jay Black, 30, and Christopher Guerrero, 20, were attacked in a lobby on East 26th Street in Manhattan. Roberto Rosado, Jr. and his brother Marcus were involved in the incident, though their level of involvement remains disputed. Guerrero was stabbed in the abdomen. Guerrero died of his wounds and Gray was critically injured. The assaults were said to have stemmed from a dispute at Club Pacha on W. 46th Street. The brothers were subsequently arrested and charged with murder in 2011. Rosado, Jr. was additionally charged with weapons possession. Tru Life pleaded guilty to \\"gang assault\\" and was sentenced to eight years in prison. His brother pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Tru Life began his prison sentence in 2011 and was released in April 2016, having served five years of his sentence.

As early as 1990, O'Brien was under surveillance by federal agents where he was observed with Mello at a 1990 meeting with \\"Cadillac\\" Frank Salemme regarding illegal gambling.

It is a revision of Somewhere in the Night, which Moorcock published in 1966 under the pseudonym Bill Barclay. Although Moorcock is best known as the author of fantasy fiction and science fiction-based parables such as Behold the Man and The Dancers at the End of Time, here he writes a light-hearted caper that parodies the spy novel genre. The Chinese Agent was recently reissued in the United Kingdom as Jerry Cornell's Comic Capers. The new edition includes a sequel, The Russian Intelligence (1980). Characters *Jeremiah \\"Jerry\\" Cornell is a handsome but slightly seedy Londoner whose shady past might have sent him to prison, were it not for certain skills that make him more valuable as an agent for British Intelligence. His name, with the initials \\"J.C.\\", is one of the author's trademarks: other Moorcock protagonists include Jherek Carnelian and Jerry Cornelius. *Arnold Hodgkiss is a young Chinese American patent attorney whose secret identity is \\"Jewellery Jules.\\" He is a notorious jewel thief who has never been caught, or even suspected. *Shirley Withers is a receptionist at the National Insurance Company (aka Cell 87), where she and Jerry both work. She initially dislikes him, mostly because she can never remember his name; she keeps calling him \\"Mr. Cornelius.\\" Later, she becomes Jerry's girlfriend, and, although he thinks it is only a temporary arrangement, she has other ideas. *Kung Fu Tzu, the Chinese agent of the title, is in London to steal plans for \\"Project Glass\\", a powerful new laser technology. He becomes convinced, through a series of accidents, that Jerry is a super agent of James Bond calibre. *The Cornells, Jerry's blood relatives, are an assortment of hideously depraved petty thieves, most of whom live together in a filthy hovel in London's slums. The most disgusting of them, Uncle Edmond, is a junk dealer with a semi-sentient midden heap in his yard. Plot introduction Arnold Hodgkiss, a jewel thief who has come to London to steal the Crown Jewels, is dreamily casing the Tower of London when a strange man approaches him and says \\"The crown is large.\\" Hodgkiss, nonplussed, replies \\"And very heavy\\", unwittingly giving the correct countersign. The man, a spy, thrusts a parcel at Hodgkiss and disappears. Hodgkiss keeps the parcel, hoping to turn it in some way to his advantage. Soon afterward, Jerry Cornell receives a new assignment: he is to discover the whereabouts of plans for \\"Project Glass,\\" which have been stolen. Although the thief has been caught, the plans are still missing, and are believed to be in the hands of a fiendish Chinese agent named Kung Fu Tzu. Meanwhile, Kung is hopping mad because he never actually got the plans; they were given to Hodgkiss by mistake. The comedy of errors intensifies as Cornell tracks Kung, who in turn follows Hodgkiss, who eludes Kung but finds trouble aplenty when he tries to steal a brooch from a stall on Portobello Road. Comments Moorcock's comic instincts show through, sometimes darkly, in many of his works; here, he gives them free rein. Nobody dies, either ‚Äì at least, not permanently. As the absurd characters frantically chase each other through the heart of London, Moorcock offers both lively comic adventure and a bizarre (but oddly affectionate) look at the city's slum-dwellers. London's Portobello Road, for example, with its hard-bitten costermongers, becomes nothing less than a force of nature: when Hodgkiss, a world-renowned jewel thief, tries to lift a brooch from a Portobello merchant's stall, he is hunted down like a dog. A still better example is Jerry's odious Uncle Edmond, who is so fantastically dirty that the rubbish pile in his yard has congealed and come to life. When two communist operatives try to intimidate him, he sneaks up behind them and pushes them into the quivering pile, escaping while they fight to extricate themselves from its gelatinous embrace.

Origin  Sheep shearing at the showground The origin of the show dates back to the 1790s when Monmouth's agricultural society organised ploughing matches. However it was not until 1857 that it was proposed that a cattle show should be created. On 30 May 1857, the eighth Duke of Beaufort gave ten pounds and John Rolls placed twenty pounds into a fund to start the Monmouth Cattle Show. The show was first staged in the October of the same year. Rolls was President of the show for his lifetime and he was succeeded by his son John Allan Rolls in 1870.  Venues  Cornering at Monmouth Show Dog agility and obedience trials In 1876 the show was held in the town's newly established cattle market in Chippenham Fields. The show was then held annually (firstly in October, but then eventually moved to August ‚Äì taking up its now traditional date of the last Thursday in August) up until the First World War. The show was restarted in 1919 when it was renamed the Monmouthshire County Show. The show was not held during the period of the Second World War, but from 1946 until 2006 it was held each year on the grounds of Vauxhall Fields. Nor was it held in 1956 or 2001 due to outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, nor 2020 on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic. 2007 marked the 150th anniversary of the Monmouthshire Show Society. That same year the show moved to a new site on the Redbrook Road in Monmouth. Date When the show started it was originally held in October but it was brought forward to September to improve the likelihood of good weather. The date has now moved to the first Saturday in July since 2017.

E-Loan was a pioneer in the online lending industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As of 1999, it was the number 1 site for online lending, with Quicken Loan's later online offering playing catch-up in 2nd after E-Loan declined a buyout offer. As of 2017, E-Loan is focused on its personal loan referral business, and as of May 15, 2017 all of its deposit customers were transferred to Popular Direct. E-Loan is a division of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico.  History  E-Loan was founded by Janina Pawlowski and Christopher Larsen in 1997. Former co-workers at a California-based mortgage lender, Pawlowski and Larsen had disagreed with their supervisor‚Äôs on-the-job demands and decided to build their own mortgage business together. They took a chance on creating an online-based lending service, just as the Internet became ubiquitous. At the time, E-Loan‚Äôs services included purchase and refinance mortgage loans, home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, and auto loans. Growth By mid-1997, the website, www.eloan.com, was launched. At the time it was the pioneer in online mortgage lending, with a Radically Simple value proposition at the time. In 1998, declining interest rates boosted mortgage originations to $1.5 billion, a 70% increase. Online loans increased only by $4.2 billion. However, at the time, E-Loan controlled 25% of the online lending market, making it the number-one online mortgage business in the world. E-Loan received $25.4 million in venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital, Yahoo Inc., and Softbank Holdings Inc.  Yahoo Investment  By August 1998, E-Loan needed a capital injection to secure growth. The online lender was burning through $250,000 per month as it tried to retain 150 employees. The founders met with Intuit Corp, which offered $130 million to acquire E-Loan. The deal would net Pawlowski and Larsen $10 million each and give them $16 million in Intuit stock. However, as part of the acquisition, E-Loan shifted from an autonomous company to having a board of trustees in charge of the decision making. In August 1998, Pawlowski approached Yahoo and negotiated to sell 23% of E-Loan for $25 million. Though the offer was substantially less profitable than the Intuit deal, it effectively maintained E-Loan‚Äôs autonomy. It also made E-Loan Yahoo‚Äôs preferred mortgage site.  Recovery & Development  In 2002, E-Loan established its headquarters in Pleasanton, California. It also created the E-loan Auto Fund One, a qualified special purpose entity that purchased prime auto loans from E-Loan and then held them. For this entity, E-Loan secured a $540 auto loan credit facility with Merrill Lynch. During this time, E-Loan‚Äôs revenues from sales consisted of discounted cash flows, net of interest, service fees, and credit losses. E-Loan started using proprietary and commercially available licensed technology from fintech providers like Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems, and Oracle. E-Loan also began using automated credit filters and proprietary underwriting engine to lower the cost of the loan origination process. The use of licensed technology effectively helped bolster E-Loan‚Äôs growth and reputation within the mortgage lending industry. In 2003, E-Loan formed Escrow Closing Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary that provides mortgage closing services such as documentation preparation and signing, disbursement, and recording services. In 2004, E-Loan originated more than $5 billion in mortgage loans. Most of those loans were fixed rate, and 70% were lines of credit. By the end of 2004, it employed 930 employees, had $121 million in assets, and $86 million in stockholder‚Äôs equity. It generated $135 million in annual revenue, and $822,000 in net income. As of 2004, 17% of the company‚Äôs shares were owned by insiders. The largest shareholder, at 5.05%, was Christian Larsen, following by Harold Bonnikson at 1.28% and Matthew J. Roberts at .85%. In 2004, 38% of the company was owned by institutional holders. The largest institutional shareholders were Second Curve Capital at 7.77%, Wells Fargo & Co. at 5.11%, American Century Investment Mgmt at 2.11%, Rice, Hall, James, & Associates at 1.82%, and Gruber & McBaine Capital Management at 1.63%.  Banco Popular Acquisition  In August 2005, the Puerto Rico-based commercial bank, Banco Popular, acquired E-Loan for $300 million. Banco Popular‚Äôs parent company, Popular Inc., known for being the largest financial institution in Puerto Rico had $46 billion in assets, more than 135 branches in the U.S., and more than 280 branches in Puerto Rico at the time it purchased E-Loan. The goal of the acquisition was to increase E-Loan‚Äôs access to financial holdings, and therefore, its loan production capacity. With this increased lending capacity, both Popular and E-Loan sought to capitalize on a cost advantage through economies of scale. In October 2008, E-Loan's parent company, Popular, Inc. said E-Loan would no longer operate as a direct mortgage lender in 2009, but would continue to provide certificates of deposit and savings accounts. Operational, general and administrative support functions would be transferred to other Popular subsidiaries. The company subsequently moved its headquarters in 2009 from Pleasanton, California to Rosemont, Illinois. Company officials said customers who have already obtained loans through E-Loan would not be affected as they were transitioned to another subsidiary of Popular.  Development After the Acquisition  In May 2017, E-Loan deposit products transitioned to Popular Direct products. Both E-Loan and Popular Direct are owned and operated by Banco Popular North America.  Awards  Since its inception, E-Loan has garnered various awards for privacy and ease-of-use: *Web Marketing Association's Web Awards Financial Services Standard of Excellence Award (2013) *New Media Awards Standard of Excellence Award (2013) *Interactive Media Award‚Äôs (IMA) Best In Class in the Banking Category (October 2013) *Top Financial Company for Privacy by TRUSTe and the Ponemon Institute (April 2007) *Ranked #3 in Privacy by The Customer Respect Group (August 2005) E-Loan was the only financial services company and the highest ranking online company to make the top ten. *Safest Places On the Web.

Like the rest of the family, the African finfoot and the sungrebe, the relationship to other birds is poorly understood. Description The masked finfoot is an underwater specialist with a long neck, a striking sharp beak and lobed feet which are green. The male and female both have a black mask and eyebrow that contrasts with a white eyering and lateral cervical stripe. The rest of the neck is grey, the breast is pale and the back, wings and tail are rich brown. The males have an all black chin while the females have a white chin. Habits and range The masked finfoot can be found in a range of habitats across the eastern Indian subcontinent through to Malaysia and Indonesia in a variety of fresh to brackish wetlands. This range includes forest, wooded savannah, flooded forest, and even mangrove swamps. The finfoot feeds on aquatic invertebrates, including both adults and larval mayflies, dragonflies, crustaceans, also snails, fish and amphibians. They are thought to be highly opportunistic and take some of their prey directly off the waters surface. They are adept out of water and will forage on the banks as well, unlike the grebes, which they resemble but are not related to. Finfoots are not gregarious in habits and are usually seen singly or in pairs. They are very secretive. Even experienced ornithologists see them very rarely, making them a prized sighting for birders and twitchers. Because they are so elusive, it is not known if they spend most of their time in the water, where they are almost always seen, or on land. The breeding biology is poorly known. It is thought to coincide with the rainy season. In Bangladesh, the breeding season was observed to extend from June to September. They build a pad-shaped nest of small sticks low above water. The nests are occasionally seen to have few long leaves, grass and reeds. Three to seven eggs are laid. The chicks are dark grey in colour with a white spot on the tip of the beak. The chicks are fed with fish and shrimps. The chicks leave the nest shortly after hatching. Status and conservation The masked finfoot is considered endangered and declining, with fewer than 2,500 birds estimated to be the world population, and populations are fragmented. Threats are human disturbance and habitat loss. The bird is protected in Malaysia.

History  Actionslacks formed in Northern California's East Bay in 1994 when ex-Pillbox members Tim Scanlin and Mark Wijsen met drummer Marty Kelly and discovered a mutual appreciation of late-70s English punk rock, 1980s American post-punk and guitar-based New Zealand indie rock. The band played one gig in Berkeley, California under the name King Friday but changed their name after Scanlin realized he \\"just couldn't be in a band named after a puppet.\\" The band soon became a regular on the San Francisco and West Coast club circuit and released the \\"Tugboat Mutiny\\" b/w \\"A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.\\" 7\\" single on their own Permanent Records imprint. In 1996 the band's first full length, Too Bright, Just Right, Good Night was released on the Minneapolis Skene! label. Actionslacks' second LP, One Word (a reference to the spelling of their name as well as a nod to the influence of Overwhelming Colorfast's second album Two Words) was recorded in 1997 and released in 1998 by the Arena Rock Recording Company. The band toured with labelmates Harvey Danger and an ascendant Death Cab for Cutie in support of the record. Wijsen left the band in late-1998 and Scanlin and Kelly began working on more pop-oriented songs, first with producers Greg Freeman (Pell Mell, Virginia Dare) and Jeff Palmer (Granfalloon Bus, Sunny Day Real Estate, Mommyheads) and later with new band members Aaron Rubin (bass; Mr. T Experience, Samiam) and Chuck Lindo (guitar and vocals; The Nukes, Jumbo Shrimp, The American Professionals). The Scene's Out of Sight was recorded in the fall of 1999 with producer/engineer J. Robbins at John Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone recording studio and released in early 2001 by the Self-Starter Foundation. The band's following grew in part due to well- timed promotions with Napster, various song placements in television shows and video games, and a strong showing on college radio. Prior to touring in support of the album, Rubin left the band and Lindo took time off to attend to other projects. Enter new permanent bassist Ross Murray and touring guitarist/singer Doug Modie. In 2002 Scanlin moved to Los Angeles and the band began a continuing long-distance relationship. Full Upright Position was written and recorded between 2001 and 2003 in various studios in California and Washington, DC. J. Robbins once again engineered and the band produced, venturing into the far-ranging territory of multi-instrumentation, elaborate arrangements and stylistic diversity (including elements of pop, alt-country and electronica). The album's release was complicated by Kelly's relocation to Maine in late 2003 and record label issues. Nevertheless, the band managed to tour both the East and West coasts, adding keyboard/vocalist Darice Bailey to help reproduce the band's new sound. Actionslacks took a semi-hiatus beginning in late 2004, with occasional live appearances and writing sessions amid individual projects, careers, and family life. In early 2008 the band was reinvigorated by the idea of a new writing and recording paradigm, writing new tracks via online collaboration and meeting up at Tiny Telephone to rehearse and record over the course of 8 days with engineer Aaron Prellwitz. The resulting collection, which marks a return to the aggressive yet tuneful punk sound of The Scene's Out of Sight, was self-released as Kids With Guitars in spring 2009. Downloaders were invited to pay however much they wished for the record. The long-distance writing approach was repeated in late 2009 and also culminated in a recording session at Tiny Telephone. While gathered the band celebrated its 15th anniversary with a show at the Bottom of the Hill. The six songs recorded during the session ultimately made up the band's final release, 2012's self-titled EP.

Playing career  = Chelsea = Britton started his career with Scottish amateur side Hillside Rangers. Aged 17 he signed as an apprentice with Londoners Chelsea in the summer of 1971, making his debut during the 1972‚Äì73 season against Derby County on 30 December 1972. With Chelsea's relegation from the First Division in 1975, which saw the departure of many of the club's established players, Britton became a regular in the first team. He was a key part of manager Eddie McCreadie's young side, alongside the likes of Ray Wilkins, Steve Finnieston and Tommy Langley, which won promotion back to the top flight in 1976‚Äì77. Chelsea were relegated once again following the 1978‚Äì79 season and remained in the old Second Division for the remainder of his time at Stamford Bridge, which came to an end in August 1982 when he returned to his home town and signed for Dundee United. In total, he played 289 games and scored 34 goals for Chelsea. = Dundee United = As a Dundee United player in the 1982‚Äì83 season, Britton helped the club win the Scottish league championship for the only time in their history. His only league goal came in a 3-3 draw with Hibernian on 26 March 1983. He also scored against Raith Rovers in the League Cup on 21 August 1982. = Blackpool = After playing two games for Arbroath at the start of the 1983‚Äì84 season, Britton joined Blackpool in November on a one-month loan deal. He impressed manager Sam Ellis, who signed him permanently for a small fee when his loan period expired. In his first season at Bloomfield Road, his goal tally was bettered only by Paul Stewart, and his best period came when he teamed up in midfield with Mike Conroy. Britton was in the Blackpool side that won promotion from the Fourth Division in 1985, swapping places with his next club Burnley, whom he joined in August 1986. But, such were the finances at Turf Moor, that manager Brian Miller was initially only able to sign him on loan. = Burnley = Britton's headed goal for the Clarets, three minutes into the second half of the final game of the 1986‚Äì87 season, secured a 2‚Äì1 win over promotion chasing Leyton Orient, helping to preserve Burnley's Football League status. Many of the side that played against Orient were subsequently released. Britton was one of only 2 members of that team to feature in the starting eleven at Wembley just one year later the other being Ray Deakin, when the Clarets faced Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Associate Members' Cup Final in front of 80,841 fans, a record for the trophy. The 1988‚Äì89 season proved to be Britton's last at Burnley and his last in League football. He'd scored his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Tranmere Rovers, and in January 1989 he scored at Prenton Park once again in what proved to be manager Brian Miller's final game in charge. Miller was replaced by Frank Casper and although Britton remained in the side for much of the remainder of the season, he was released at the end of his third year with the club.  Retirement  Having ended his professional career, Britton became involved in local semi- professional football, briefly managing Nelson in the mid-1990s. He lived in East Lancashire where he was the manager of the Seedhill Athletics and Fitness Centre operated by Pendle Leisure Trust. On 31 March 2016, it was reported that Britton had died of cancer at the age of 61.Ian Britton: 1954 - 2016  References   *  External links  *Clarets-Mad Player Profile * Category:1954 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Footballers from Dundee Category:Scottish footballers Category:Arbroath F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Dundee United F.C. players Category:Morecambe F.C. players Category:Nelson F.C. managers Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Scottish football managers Category:Place of death missing ","title":"Ian Britton (Scottish footballer)"},{"id":"8038692","text":"Matt Clark is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. The role was originated by Eddie Cibrian in May 1994, who left the show in 1996. After Russell Lawrence briefly playing the character in 2000, Rick Hearst took over the role that year, departing in 2001 after the character was killed off. Hearst returned for several appearances as an apparition. Matt was known as an antagonistic villain who created problems for Nick and Sharon Newman, beginning when they were teens in high school. He raped both Sharon Collins and Amy Wilson, and framed Nicholas Newman for multiple crimes. Casting and characterization Rick Hearst played Matt Clark from 2000 to 2001. Eddie Cibrian was hired to portray recurring character Matt Clark in May 1994. In October of that year, he signed a three- year contract with the series. Cibrian said that he believed the writers \\"were going to turn the story into something bigger\\" and wanted to keep it going. The character exited in 1996 after nearly three years. Russell Lawrence became the next actor in the role, portraying Matt in 2000. However, he was replaced a few months later with Rick Hearst who debuted in October 2000. Hearst was familiar with the soap opera genre, having played Alan-Michael Spaulding on Guiding Light for several years prior. TimesDaily wrote: \\"Expect the storyline of the vengeful Matt to be stepped up with Hearst in the role\\". In April 2001, it was announced that Hearst would exit, and the character died onscreen the following month. However, due to Hearst's popularity with viewers, the actor returned for several recurring guest appearances beginning July 2001 as a vision being seen by the insane Tricia Dennison after his character's death. Speaking on his exit and appearances afterward, Hearst said: \\"I look at every opportunity as a gift. When I was let go (...) and was brought back as a freaking apparition for six months, I looked at it as, they called me for work this week.\\" Matt has been characterized by Soaps In Depth as the show's previous \\"bad boy\\", and a \\"cocky jock-turned rapist\\" by Star-News. Cibrian called him \\"horrific\\", stating: \\"I've never encountered anybody like him in my life. Nor would I ever want to.\\" The character started out as a \\"regular guy\\" on the show, but after Cibrian became a regular cast member, he began doing \\"awful things\\" and became \\"the bad guy\\", beginning with raping Sharon Collins (Sharon Case). Cibrian found the role challenging and said: \\"Unfortunately there are people in the world like Matt. That‚Äôs why they put this in the script, so people could be aware.\\" Storylines As a high school senior in 1994, Matt Clark dates Sharon Collins and develops a bitter rivalry with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow) who ends up winning Sharon from him. A fight between Matt and Nick results in Nick being badly beaten. Shortly thereafter, Matt rapes Sharon, causing her to sink into a depression. Matt then dates Amy Wilson (Julianne Morris), Sharon's best friend. Reacting to Nick and Sharon becoming king and queen of their high school Polynesian dance, Matt exposes Sharon's secret: that she is not a virgin, and had given up a baby for adoption when she was 16. While Nick is briefly angry at Sharon, he forgives her and the pair become engaged. After Sharon confesses to Nick that Matt raped her, just prior to their planned wedding, Nick goes after Matt, but instead finds him lying in a pool of blood on his apartment floor, having been shot. Nick is arrested, while Matt survives and falsely claims that Nick shot him. After a trial, Nick is found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Nick's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) tracks down Amy in a mental institution, who has been suffering from PTSD. Amy reveals that she was the person who shot Matt after he raped her. Nick is acquitted and Matt leaves town in 1996. In 2000, Matt Clark resurfaces in town under the alias of Carter Mills, having had plastic surgery to change his appearance, and begins working at Nick and Sharon's coffeehouse. Carter uses Tricia Dennison (Sabryn Genet), a woman he slept with, to frame Nick for selling drugs. Sharon grows close with Carter while Nick is in jail. Carter nearly succeeds in raping Sharon by using a date rape drug, but Nick arrives home and his plans are thwarted. Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) begins searching for Matt Clark, realizing that he may have had plastic surgery. Carter later meets Sharon at a cabin in the woods and tries to rape her there, but is stopped when Victor arrives. Tricia drives off with Carter in her car but deliberately drives off a cliff in an attempt to kill them both. While Tricia survives the crash, Carter had fatal injuries. Carter pulls out his own breathing tube, killing himself, and framing Nick for his murder. Nick is implicated in Carter's murder, but is ultimately found not guilty. Just before Matt's death, he lied to Nick, telling him that he had raped Sharon. Sharon becomes pregnant, and Nick demands a paternity test, which she refuses (not wanting to harm the child). After a fight with Nick, Sharon runs after him and trips over a chair. The fall causes her to give birth prematurely to a stillborn baby. A paternity test confirmed that Nick was the father, not Matt. Reception Both Cibrian and Hearst became popular for their portrayals of Matt. In 1996, soap opera journalist Seli Groves of The Beaver County Times newspaper opined that it was likely for Matt to return one day, writing that \\"characters with this sort of seething history are often recalled from soap limbo\\". A message published in the newspaper by a viewer named Andrea P. described the character of Matt as \\"a real rat\\", but with the observation that Cibrian \\"played it so well\\". When Lawrence was cast in the role, Toby Goldstein of TimesDaily noted that Matt was \\"likely to bring misery to Nick and Sharon's lives\\". Global TV's Aaron Hagey-MacKay included the character's death on a list of the \\"Top drunken, brutal, mysterious and volcanic deaths of Y&R;\\". Entertainment Weekly called Matt an \\"evil rapist\\", while Sara Bibel of Xfinity argued in 2009 that the character was written out due to being a rapist, stating that the soap opera was \\"the one show with a zero tolerance for sexual assault\\".

It has a land area of 230.675 sq mi (597.445 km¬≤), over 95 percent of which is designated as off-reservation trust land. According to the 2000 census, the resident population is 2,167 persons.Ramah Navajo Reservation (Tribal Census Tract 9458), Navajo Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land, Arizona/New Mexico/Utah United States Census Bureau The Ramah Reservation's land area is less than one percent of the Navajo Nation's total area. Although part of the Navajo Nation, the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation has had an independent history from that of the other Navajo lands. The Ramah Navajo have been recorded in this area of New Mexico since 1540, when they came to the aid of the Zuni in their defense against the Spanish conquistador Francisco V√°squez de Coronado. In the years from 1868 through the 1960s, the Ramah Navajo acted independently of the Navajo Nation. Although part of the Navajo Nation since the 1960s, they accomplished some \\"firsts.\\" They founded the Pine Hill community with its Pine Hill Navajo School and health clinic. Community leaders, professionals, and Michael Gross, a lawyer from the East who had begun to work in legal services for Native Americans, obtained funding directly from the U.S. Congress in the early 1970s for the school and clinic. Although the Ramah Band of Navajo had lived on their lands for several centuries up to the 1970s, their rights to them had not been fully secured under United States law since a transfer by the U.S. government had not occurred. The Navajo on these lands were not eligible for the services and benefits provided by the governmental agencies and departments to federally recognized tribes on trust lands. In 1979, the volunteer, Jan Crull, Jr. succeeded, securing Public Law 96-333 .John Melcher,chair.

Crull's work led to his nomination by the Navajo for the Rockefeller Public Service Award in 1981, which was endorsed by U.S. senators Dennis DeConcini, Pete Domenici, and John Melcher; and U.S. congressmen Manuel Lujan, Jr. and Paul Simon.

He was the Bishop of Chester in the Church of England and a Lord Spiritual (member of the House of Lords). Early life and education Born in Solihull, the son of Thomas Forster by his marriage to Edna Russell, Forster was educated at the town's Tudor Grange Grammar School. He stated in the House of Lords on 8 February 2016 that he had spent his gap year making Land Rover Defenders and was auto-enrolled into the TGWU. He studied at Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in chemistry, promoted to Oxford Master of Arts (MA Oxon) in 1973. At the University of Edinburgh, he graduated as a Bachelor of Divinity (BD) in theology in 1977 and as a Doctor of Philosophy in 1985. Ordained ministry He was ordained a deacon at Petertide 1980 (on 29 June) and a priest the next Petertide (12 July 1981), both times by David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool, at Liverpool Cathedral. From 1980 to 1982, Forster was assistant curate of the Mossley Hill Parish Church in Liverpool. He was senior tutor at St John's College, Durham, from 1983 to 1991 and became the vicar of Beverley Minster in 1992. =Episcopal ministry= In 1996, Forster was appointed the 40th Bishop of Chester. He was consecrated a bishop (alongside John Packer, Bishop of Warrington and later Bishop of Ripon and Leeds) during a service at York Minster, by David Hope, Archbishop of York, on 13 November 1996.Diocese of Chester ‚Äî Bishops (Accessed 6 May 2017) He was enthroned on 11 January 1997 and in 2001 took his seat as a Lord Spiritual in the House of Lords. In 2003, Forster raised controversy when he was investigated by the police for an alleged \\"hate speech\\" after suggesting that homosexual people should seek psychiatric treatment. However, no charges were made, and the police were satisfied that no offence had been committed. He was one of nine bishops who signed a letter disagreeing with the decision of Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, not to block the appointment of Jeffrey John as Bishop of Reading in 2003. In 2012, amid controversy over the amount of expenses claimed by bishops for attending the House of Lords, it was revealed that Forster had claimed more than any other bishop in 2010/11. In that year he was a member of two select committees. He had claimed ¬£34,909 and had attended on 97 days. In March 2019, he called for Parliament to agree to Theresa May's Brexit deal during a debate in the House of Lords. In March 2019, Forster faced calls to resign following the cover-up of a child sex abuse scandal in the diocese. A priest who had been accused of sex offences 35 years earlier, wrote confidentially about the allegations in a letter to the diocese in 2009. Chester diocese failed to tell police, and allowed him to act as a retired priest for a further five years. The letter came to light during a police investigation in 2017 of a previous Bishop of Chester, Victor Whitsey, who has been named in abuse cases as a paedophile. Following a meeting with John Sentamu, Archbishop of York, Forster formally delegated all diocesan safeguarding responsibility to Keith Sinclair, Bishop of Birkenhead. Sir Roger Singleton CBE, interim director of the Church's National Safeguarding Team, instigated a Church Disciplinary Measure (CDM) process against Forster, which can result in a tribunal if evidence of malpractice is found. The Bishop claimed that he acted in accordance with the policy guidance which applied in 2009, and vigorously contested the allegation by the Interim Safeguarding Director. The Church also announced plans for an independent review to identify any lessons that can be learned. In April 2019, Forster announced that he would retire on 30 September 2019. Personal life Forster married Elisabeth Anne Stevenson in 1978, and they have four children. His brother-in-law, Kenneth Stevenson, was also a bishop.

Armed with crossbows, it fought both on land and in naval battles; notable cases of the latter are the battles of Meloria and Curzola.  Membership  The members of the Genoese crossbowmen were trained and organized in Genoa, but also came from other parts of Liguria. They also came from other regions of Montferrat, certain towns of the Plain of the Po, including Pavia, Piacenza and Parma, and Corsica, but were formed and organized in Genoahttps://www.academia.edu/21560829/_Boni_balistrarii_de_ripperia_Ianue_._Balestrieri_genovesi_attraverso_due_cartulari_del_1357_in_Archivio_Storico_Italiano_CLXVIII_2010_. Commanders of the companies usually came from the noble families of the city.  Equipment  The main armament of the Genoese crossbowmen was the crossbow, made in Genoa by the Balistrai Corporation. As well, the mercenaries were equipped with a dagger, a light metal helmet, a gorget, a hauberk and a large shield, called a pavese (pavise), which was used while reloading the crossbow. The usual team consisted of a crossbowman and two assistants, one supporting the pavise, the other responsible for spanning a second bow, thus doubling the rate of fire.  History  Fresco by Lazzaro Tavarone at the Palazzo Cattaneo Adorno, depicting the crossbowmen of Genoa during the storming of Jerusalem. The Genoese crossbowmen came to prominence during the First Crusade, when the Genoese commander Guglielmo Embriaco used the corps in the course of the siege of Jerusalem, and again at the Battle of Jaffa in 1192 during the Third Crusade. The Genoese crossbowmen remained one of the most respected military corps until the 16th century, well after the introduction of black-powder weapons in Europe. The heavy losses created by Genoese crossbows led medieval monarchs to extreme measures. Emperor Frederick II, after the defeat at the siege of Parma triggered by a Genoese sally, ordered that the crossbowmen taken prisoner have their fingers cut off. During the Battle of Cr√©cy, in August 1346, upwards of 5,000 Genoese crossbowmen, led by Ottone Doria and Carlo Grimaldi, were employed by the French in the first line against the English. Unfortunately the precipitous nature of the French advance to Cr√©cy had meant that the wagons containing the pavises and extra ammunition had been left behind and the crossbowmen found themselves unable to deploy in their usual well-protected teams N F Green: Lives and Times of the Garter Knights 1348-1600 pp16-17. At around 4 PM, a sudden rainstorm arose. The English longbowmen simply removed their bowstrings, and stored them under their water- resistant leather caps to keep them dry. Crossbows, on the other hand, cannot be unstrung and restrung without tools. The strings of the crossbows thus became stretched upon being drenched by rain. When the rain-soaked and now- stretched crossbow strings were used roughly an hour later during the initial attack against the emplaced and defending English, the crossbows were largely rendered useless. When the Genoese crossbowmen, unprotected by their usual pavises, came under heavy fire from the English longbowmen, the Genoese commander, Ottone Doria, ordered his troops to retreat. The French knights commanded by Charles II, Count of Alen√ßon behind the Genoese crossbowmen saw this as cowardice and cut them down as they retreated. Most of the crossbowmen were killed, their commander included. Losing only a very small number of soldiers, the English won the battle handily through directed long distance shooting with longbows against the French men-at-arms and the Genoese crossbowmen.

It is commonly known as snow-in-summer, narrow- leaved paperbark, flax-leaved paperbark and in the language of the Gadigal people as budjur. A hardy plant, it flowers prolifically in late spring or summer, making it a popular garden shrub or small tree in temperate places. Melaleuca trichostachya is a similar species but its leaves are arranged differently and the fruits have projecting valves.Street trees in Albany, California Description Melaleuca linariifolia is a small tree growing to a height of with distinctive and attractive white or creamy white, papery bark and a dense canopy. Its leaves are arranged in alternating pairs (decussate), glabrous except when very young, long, wide, linear to lance-shaped and with a distinct mid-vein. The flowers are white to creamy-white, perfumed and arranged in spikes on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering, sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. Each spike is up to wide and long and contains 4 to 20 individual flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower and each bundle contains 32 to 73 stamens. The flowers cover the tree over a relatively short period, between October and February and are followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long and long scattered along the stems. The fruiting capsules have valves which do not project beyond the rim of the capsule. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca linariifolia was first formally described in 1797 by James Edward Smith in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. Smith noted that \\"This, we are told by Mr White, is a large tree, the bark of which is very thick and spongy, serving the purpose of tinder.\\" The specific epithet linariifolia means \\"with leaves like Linaria\\" (a genus of plants in the family Plantaginaceae). Distribution Snow-in-summer occurs from the Maryborough district in Queensland to Bawley Point in the Ulladulla district in New South Wales. There is also a disjunct population in the Blackdown Tableland National Park in Queensland. It is found in heath and dry sclerophyll forest habitats, usually growing near watercourses or swamps. Uses =Horticulture= Melaleuca linariifolia is cultivated as an ornamental tree for parks and gardens and is also used as a screen or windbreak in Australia and overseas. It is popular as a nature strip tree in Melbourne in Victoria. It tolerates both dry and boggy conditions and is frost hardy. It should be planted with caution as it can damage wastewater pipes, and is easily ignitable, so should not be planted in fire-prone areas. It has also become a garden escape in Western Australia, however it suitable for planting under powerlines and is a food or habitat sources for native animals, including many insects. There is a range of cultivars that has been developed including dwarf forms such as 'Snowstorm' which grows to a height of , 'Seafoam' at , and 'Claret Tops' at , which features claret coloured new growth.Melaleuca linariifolia 'Claret Tops'.

He played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cincinnati Bengals for six seasons and was invited to three Pro Bowls, as well as an All-Pro in 1976. He played college football at Louisiana State University, where he was a three-time first-team All-American. He is a Republican former member of the Louisiana State Senate, having served a single term from 1996 to 2000. Early life and college  Casanova attended the Roman Catholic Notre Dame High School in Crowley, Louisiana. As a senior at Notre Dame, he was chosen to play in the Louisiana High School Coaches Association all-star game. After high school, Casanova attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he played for the LSU Tigers football team. He was a running back, kick returner, and defensive back for the Tigers. As a freshman in 1968, he led the Bayou Bengals in rushing with 209 yards on 54 attempts. He also returned punts and kickoffs, and was a defensive standout.Tommy Casanova ‚Äì Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame. lasportshall.com. Retrieved December 31, 2016. In 1969, Casanova's first year on the varsity, he was shifted to cornerback. LSU fielded four defensive All-Americans in linebackers George Bevan and Mike Anderson, defensive tackle Ron Estay, and Casanova. Casanova was recognized as a first-team All-American by Football News. The Tigers lost only one game that year, to arch-rival Ole Miss. As a junior in 1970, Casanova was a consensus All-American. He earned first-team honors from the Associated Press (AP) and American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), and second-team honors from United Press International (UPI) and the Central Press. In a 61‚Äì17 rout of Ole Miss in the final game of the regular season, Casanova had punt return touchdowns of 61 and 73 yards, tying the NCAA record for punt return touchdowns in a game. Prior to his senior year in 1971, Casanova was featured on the front cover of the September 13, 1971 issue of Sports Illustrated, with the headline, \\"Tommy Casanova of LSU, Best Player in the Nation.\\" In the second game of the season, against Texas A&M;, Casanova pulled his right hamstring muscle and subsequently missed the next five games. He recorded his only interception of the year later that season in a nationally televised 28‚Äì8 victory over No. 7 Notre Dame. Despite missing nearly half the season due to injury, Casanova was again a consensus All-American, earning first-team recognition from the Football Writers Association of America and UPI. After his college career, Casanova played in the 1972 Chicago College All-Star Game against the Dallas Cowboys. His defensive play was lauded in the All-Stars' 20‚Äì7 loss. Casanova was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995. In 2000, the Walter Camp Football Foundation selected Casanova for their All-Century team, honoring the best college football players of the 20th century. His jersey number 37 was retired by LSU football on October 10, 2009. NFL and collegiate coach Pete Carroll has stated that Casanova was one of his all-time favorite players. NFL Casanova was drafted in the second of round of the 1972 NFL Draft with the 29th overall pick by the Cincinnati Bengals. After the draft, he received an offer from the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League, which he considered but he ultimately declined, and signed with the Bengals. Casanova played as a safety with the Bengals and also returned punts. As a rookie, he intercepted five passes on defense and had a 66-yard punt return for a touchdown. He was named the team MVP by his teammates after the season. In 1973, he had four interceptions, including two against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the seventh game of the season. He also had an interception in the Bengals' 34‚Äì16 divisional playoff loss to the Miami Dolphins. Casanova was invited to his first Pro Bowl after the 1974 season. In 1975, Casanova moved from free safety to strong safety. His most productive year on defense was in 1976; he intercepted five passes and returned two of them for touchdowns and also returned a recovered fumble for a touchdown. He was invited to his second Pro Bowl and was recognized as a first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. He had another Pro Bowl appearance in 1977 and retired after that season. Casanova compiled 17 interceptions in his career with the Bengals and scored three touchdowns on defense and one on a punt return. Later life and politics While playing for the Bengals, Casanova began to pursue his M.D. at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. In 1977, he quit playing football early to pursue his medical degree full-time. He graduated from the UC College of Medicine in 1980, and then began a three-year residency in ophthalmology in New Orleans. After completing his residency in 1983, Casanova went on to complete a specialization in oculoplastic surgery at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In the 1995 nonpartisan blanket primary in the historically Democratic District 26, formerly District 24, the Republican Casanova upset veteran Democrat state Senator Armand Brinkhaus. Casanova received 21,543 votes (58 percent) to Brinkhaus's 15,753 (42 percent). In addition to Acadia and St. Landry, the district included parts of five other parishes: Avoyelles, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis, and Lafayette. During his term Casanova served alongside another physician, Donald E. Hines, who subsequently was the state Senate President from 2004 to 2008. After a single term, Casanova declined to seek reelection and returned to his ophthalmology practice in Crowley. He was succeeded by the Democrat Fred Hoyt.

It is a tree with spongy bark, prickly leaves and spikes of creamy-white flowers. Description It is a small to medium-sized tree up to high with a dense, rounded canopy and drooping branchlets. The spongy bark is white or light brown and peels off in large strips. The leaves are sessile, long and wide. They are slightly twisted, have sharply-pointed tips, are arranged alternately on the branchlets and have between 15 and 30 veins. Flowers appear in summer in cream or white cylindrical \\"bottlebrush\\" spikes which are long and in diameter. Often new growth appears at the end of the spikes. Following flowering, grey-brown, woody capsules appear in clusters along the branchlets. These are ovoid, stalkless and in diameter Newcastle Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1797 by botanist James Edward Smith in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London from plant material collected by David Burton near Port Jackson. The specific epithet (styphelioides) refers to the similarity of the leaves of this species with those of a plant in the genus Styphelia in the family Ericaceae. Distribution and habitat The species occurs along stream banks or other moist situations, mostly in coastal areas from Nowra in New South Wales and northwards in to Queensland. Use in horticulture This melaleuca thrives in a variety of situations ranging from swampy to hot and dry, and due to its deep-rooting characteristics lawn can be grown under its canopy. It is used as a street tree in Sydney, with good examples in Campsie, an inner southwestern suburb, and also along numerous streets in various suburbs of Greater Melbourne.

However, this collection of aphorisms may have appeared some time after the first attested translations, and may even have been compiled in Central Asia or China.Sharf 1996, p.360 According to tradition, it was translated by two Yuezhi monks, Kasyapa Matanga (Ëø¶ËëâÊë©È®∞) and Dharmaratna (Á´∫Ê≥ïËò≠), in 67 CE. Because of its association with the entrance of Buddhism to China, it is accorded a very significant status in East Asia.Kuan, 12. Story of translation In the Annals of the Later Han and the Mouzi lihuo lun, Emperor Ming of Han (r. 58-75 C.E.) was said to have dreamed of a spirit, who had a \\"gold body\\" and a head which emitted \\"rays of light\\".Sharf 1996, p.360 His advisers identified the spirit as Buddha, who was supposed to have the power of flight.Sharf 1996, p.360 The emperor then ordered a delegation (led by Zhang Qian Sharf 1996, p.360) to go west looking for the Buddha's teachings. The envoys returned, bringing with them the two Indian monks Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaratna, and brought them back to China along with the sutra. When they reached the Chinese capital of Luoyang, the emperor had the White Horse Temple built for them.Sharf 1996, p.361 They are said to have translated six texts, the Sutra of Dharmic-Sea Repertory (Ê≥ïÊµ∑ËóèÁ∂ì), Sutra of the Buddha's Deeds in His Reincarnations (‰ΩõÊú¨Ë°åÁ∂ì), Sutra of Terminating Knots in the Ten Holy Terras (ÂçÅÂú∞Êñ∑ÁµêÁ∂ì), Sutra of the Buddha's Reincarnated Manifestations (‰ΩõÊú¨ÁîüÁ∂ì), Compilation of the Divergent Versions of the Two Hundred and Sixty Precepts (‰∫åÁôæÂÖ≠ÂçÅÊàíÂêàÁï∞), and the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters. Only the last one has survived.Kuan, 19-24. Scholars, however, question the date and authenticity of the story. First, there is evidence that Buddhism was introduced into China prior to the date of 67 given for Emperor Ming's vision. Nor can the sutra be reliably dated to the first century. In 166 C.E., in a memorial to Emperor Huan, the official Xiang Kai referred to this scripture multiple times. For example, Xiang Kai claims that, \\"The Buddha did not pass three nights under the [same] mulberry tree; he did not wish to remain there long,\\" which is a reference to Section 2 of the scripture. Furthermore, he also refers to Section 24 of the scripture, when Xiang Kai tells the story of a deity presenting a beautiful maiden to the Buddha, to which the Buddha replies that \\"This is nothing but a leather sack filled with blood.\\"Sharf 1996, p.361 Nonetheless, while these sections seem to mirror the extant edition of the text, it is possible that the edition we now have differs substantially from the version of the text circulating in the second century. Structure and comparison with other works The Sutra of Forty-two Chapters consists of a brief prologue and 42 short chapters (mostly under 100 Chinese characters), composed largely of quotations from the Buddha. Most chapters begin \\"The Buddha said...\\" (‰ΩõË®Ä...), but several provide the context of a situation or a question asked of the Buddha. The scripture itself is not considered a formal sutra, and early scriptures refer to the work as \\"Forty-two Sections from Buddhist Scriptures\\" or \\"The Forty-two Sections of Emperor Xiao Ming.\\" Sharf 1996, p.361-362 It is unclear whether the scripture existed in Sanskrit in this form, or was a compilation of a series of passages extracted from other canonical works in the manner of the Analects of Confucius. This latter hypothesis also explains the similarity of the repeated \\"The Buddha said...\\" and \\"The Master said,\\" familiar from Confucian texts, and may have been the most natural inclination of the Buddhist translators in the Confucian environment, and more likely to be accepted than a lengthy treatise. Among those who consider it based on a corresponding Sanskrit work, it is considered to be older than other Mahayana Sutras, because of its simplicity of style and naturalness of method. Scholars have also been able to find the aphorisms present in this scripture in various other Buddhist works such as Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta, Anguttara Nikayas, and Mahavagga. Furthermore, scholars are also uncertain if the work was first compiled in India, Central Asia, or China.Sharf 1996, p.362 In fiction In Jin Yong's novel The Deer and the Cauldron, the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters is the key to the Manchu's treasures. The Shunzhi Emperor, who is unwilling to let out the secret, spread rumours about it being the source of life of the invading Manchus. The protagonist, Wei Xiaobao, manages to get hold of all the eight books at the end of the novel. In modern Buddhism The Sutra in Forty-two Chapters is well known in East Asian Buddhism today. It has also played a role in the spread of Buddhism to the West. Shaku Soen (1859-1919), the first Japanese Zen master to teach in the West, gave a series of lectures based on this sutra in a tour of America in 1905-6. John Blofeld, included a translation of this scripture in a series begun in 1947.Sharf 1996, p.362.

The station was owned by Midwest Broadcasting. The channel 25 frequency was then used by WCGV-TV (unrelated to WCAN-TV) until January 8, 2018, when it went off the air and moved to a subchannel of CW affiliate WVTV as a result of the FCC spectrum auction. History WCAN, which first signed on the air at 11:25 P.M. Central Time on September 6, 1953, was the first UHF and second overall television station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A primary affiliate of the CBS network, perhaps it is most noted for having been the only CBS affiliate in Wisconsin to air Edward R. Murrow's See It Now broadcast of March 9, 1954, in which the anti-Communist campaign of Wisconsin Senator Joseph R. McCarthy was criticized. As a CBS affiliate, the station did well in the ratings, even surpassing NBC affiliate WTMJ-TV, rare at the time for a UHF station. The station, along with WOKY-TV (channel 19, now WVTV), was also profitable as a CBS affiliate, and helped spur purchases of UHF converter boxes in the Milwaukee area. On October 21, 1954, CBS purchased rival WOKY, a part-time ABC/Dumont affiliate, for $335,000 and announced it was moving its affiliation from WCAN-TV to the newly acquired station. WCAN-TV owner Lou Poller sold CBS the studio facilities of WCAN-TV, effectively merging the station into WOKY-TV, which then took on the new call sign WXIX. The last day of broadcasting for WCAN-TV was February 26, 1955, after which Poller turned the license for the station back to the Federal Communications Commission. CBS had given Poller the old WOKY-TV studio to continue broadcasting on Channel 25, but Poller never did so. In 1958, the FCC shifted the UHF channel allocations in Milwaukee from Channels 19, 25 and 31 to Channels 18, 24 and 30. Lou Poller held a construction permit to put a new station on Channel 24, but sold it in December 1966 to Field Communications, which had just put WFLD on the air in Chicago and was seeking to expand that independent station's market coverage with a full-powered repeater station in Milwaukee. However, Field never built the station, and the permit was deleted by the FCC in 1969. WCGV-TV, whose original construction permit dates back only to 1973, started broadcasting on Channel 24 in 1980, coincidentally using the old WCAN-TV studio site on North 27th Street in Milwaukee.

The Eco-Lodge has a restaurant and 7 comfortable cabins each with 3 beds and private bathroom. \\"Bala\\" means \\"bullet\\" or \\"cannon ball\\". The landmark is the ‚Äôshot hole‚Äô in the nearby Mountain range that is visible from the lodge. San Miguel is a small community of 32 families. They are Tacana Indians who have historically lived along the shores of the Beni and Tuichi rivers and within the boundaries of the famous Madidi National Park. They live in harmony with their environment and from various small commercial ventures such as handicrafts, fishing and agriculture. Now they also live from visits to their eco-tourism lodge that they have built and run themselves with the financial and technical help of local authorities and several NGOs and the United Nations Development Fund. The inhabitants of San Miguel del Bala use the income from the community-based project to better their lives - education, health, and such - and to preserve the incredibly rich biodiversity in and around the Madidi National Park. When Madidi was created it was their biggest enemy, but tourism's many advantages to the community have completely changed their opinion. Instead of hating the national park they are now among its fiercest protectors and are proud to be nominated as honorary park rangers by the national park itself. Their way of living and the way they manage their lodge is completely sustainable and will allow their children and grandchildren to live maybe even better than they are living.

Stream also owned an FM station in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Stream leased space in a newly constructed bank building in Odessa and built new studios and production spaces. The new ownership also built a new FM transmitter facility that was more centrally located between Odessa and Midland and enabled the station to upgrade to 100,000 watts. With the upgrades, the station relaunched as KUFO-FM, becoming a popular album-oriented rock station. The manager and chief architect was Frank Hall. The program director was J. Michael Scott. The relocation of equipment was handled by Paul Easter (Houston Christian Broadcasters and Fort Bend Broadcast Services). In the fall of 1985, Stream sold its two Odessa stations to separate owners. KUFO-FM was sold by Stream to East/West Broadcasting, formed by partners Steve Horowitz, Bill Gruber and Dick Warren. East/West relaunched the station as KODM \\"FM98\\" with a more mainstream sound. The audience that KUFO's rock format had built over the years was very loyal, and when the new KODM ownership announced it was going to change formats, much pressure was put on them to somehow save it. So, to keep the peace, a deal was made with KBAT FM to donate all of the AOR albums in the KODM library to KBAT FM, which was struggling with their ratings at the time. Within a few months, KODM was moved from the bank building to new facilities in a strip mall called Market Place, located at University and Parkway in Odessa. Program consultant Lee Randall was contracted to re-format the programming and to position it for a broader audience with wider advertiser appeal. One of the more positive changes made was the teaming of Dave Perkins and Kathy Redwine as hosts of the morning show. Rodney Scott, an overnight DJ who stayed on from KUFO, made several \\"after work\\" morning show appearances. His contribution became so popular that he relinquished his overnight duties and became a permanent member of the morning team. Other staff disc jockeys included Kacey Caldemeyer, Keri Teegarden (from KUFO), program director Brad Holcomb, and Will Wallace. Brad's brother, Gordon, served as sales manager. During its four-year run as an East/West Broadcasting property, \\"FM98\\" dominated the Arbitron ratings and enjoyed massive popularity among adults, particularly women. At a Business Appreciation luncheon held in May, 1987, the Odessa Chamber of Commerce honored KODM with the Business Excellence Award for 1986, citing KODM's \\"...firm belief in Odessa and the area's economic future.\\" The award was presented to station partner and manager Bill Gruber by Bill Griffin, then-president of the Odessa Chamber. KODM was again sold in May 1989, to New York-based D&F; Broadcasting (KROD/KLAQ in El Paso) based in New York. At that time, many of its staffers moved on to other ventures; Dave Perkins was hired by WGAR FM in Cleveland, Ohio, where his morning show became one of the top five in the Cleveland market. On April 7, 2017, KODM rebranded as \\"Mix 97.9\\", with no change in format.KODM Turns Off Its Lite Radioinsight - April 7, 2017 Personalities Current on-air personalities include The Kidd Kraddick Morning Show, Alicia Seline, and Kevin Chase.

Its site is occupied by the modern town of Ereƒüli in Konya Province, Turkey. Strabo, after mentioning Tyana, says \\"that not far from it are Castabala and Cybistra, forts which are still nearer to the mountain,\\" by which he means Taurus. Cybistra and Castabala were in that division of Cappadocia which was called Cilicia. Strabo makes it six days' journey from Mazaca to the Pylae Ciliciae, through Tyana, which is about half way; then he makes it 300 stadia, or about two days' journey, from Tyana to Cybistra, which leaves about a day's journey from Cybistra to the Pylae. William Martin Leake observed, \\"We learn also from the Table that Cybistra was on the road from Tyana to Mazaca, and sixty-four Roman miles from the former.\\" Ptolemy places Cybistra in Cataonia. When Cicero was proconsul of Cilicia (51/50 BCE), he led his troops southwards towards the Taurus through that part of Cappadocia which borders on Cilicia, and he encamped \\"on the verge of Cappadocia, not far from Taurus, at a town Cybistra, in order to defend Cilicia, and at the same time hold Cappadocia.Cicero, ad Fans. 15.2, 4. Cicero stayed five days at Cybistra, and on hearing that the Parthians were a long way off that entrance into Cappadocia, and were hanging on the borders of Cilicia, he immediately marched into Cilicia through the Pylae of the Taurus, and came to Tarsus.Cicero, ad Att. 5.20 This is quite consistent with Strabo.  Bishopric  Cybistra was from an early stage a Christian bishopric, as shown by the participation of its bishop Timotheus in the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Cyrus took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 351 and was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the Roman province of Cappadocia Secunda, to which Cybistra belonged, sent in 458 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian after the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. The diocese no longer appears in Notitiae Episcopatuum from the end of the 15th century.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 401-404Raymond Janin, v.

He also wrote in many other genres which, over six and a half decades, included eleven collections of poems, eight plays, eight novels, fifteen collections of essays, several of which won major literary awards. He also translated several books from diverse languages into Turkish.Details under the author‚Äôs name at the Turkish Cultural Foundation  Biography  Melih Cevdet Anday was born in Istanbul in 1915 and lived there until his parents moved to Ankara in 1931. He graduated from Gazi High School and for a while began studying sociology in Belgium on a State Railways scholarship but had to return home in 1940 after the German invasion. Between 1942‚Äì51 he worked as a publication consultant for the Ministry of Education in Ankara and then as a city librarian. During this time he began his career as a journalist for several newspapers. After 1954, he worked as a teacher for the Istanbul Municipal Conservatory. Between 1964 and 1969, Anday served on Turkish Radio Television‚Äôs Board of Directors. After he retired from his position in the Conservatory in 1977, Anday was assigned to UNESCO Headquarters in Paris as Cultural Attach√© until recalled after a change of Government.Turkish Cultural Foundation  Literary career  As a poet, Anday was one of the leaders of the Garip movement, which also included Orhan Veli and Oktay Rifat. According to the preface of their joint collection, published in 1941, poetry should abandon the formalism and rhetorical classical style of previous centuries, making itself simple, colloquial, and matter of fact‚Äîan artless art designed to serve the common people.There is a translation of the preface in the online journal by poets Sidney Wade and Efe Murad, The Critical Flame However, present there even then was an uneasy acknowledgement of French Surrealism, and Anday was eventually to change his engaged style to a cerebral neo-surrealism as he cautiously navigated beyond the difficult political waters of his country. This culminated in what was regarded at the time as his masterwork, the four- sectioned long poem \\"Ulysses Bound\\" (Kollari Bagli Odysseus) of 1963.Tal√¢t Sait Halman, A Millennium of Turkish Literature: A Concise History, Syracuse University 2011, pp.99-100 In this he deploys an original rhetoric of his own: :A slow world, in progress, with no memory :Visible only to the eye before there was an eye :Where nameless beings were advancing among other beings :Trees grew before trees were :And a star in the temple of the clouds :Opened wide the unharvested sky :To the bloody dawn of the epochs before there was reason.Song 1, section 1 Other sectioned poems of some length were to follow, including \\"On the Nomad Sea\\" (G√∂√ßebe Denizin √úst√ºnde, 1970)Translated in A Brave New Quest: 100 Modern Turkish Poems, Syracuse University Press 2006, pp.72-77 and \\"A poem in the manner of Karacaoglan\\" (Karacaoƒülan‚Äôƒ±n Bir ≈ûiiri √úzerine √áe≈üitlemeler‚Äôde).See External Links below for some sections But there were also many short poems of disarming simplicity such as \\"Sun\\" (I was just about to speak/ When suddenly the sun came out) and \\"Seagull\\" (Seagull, capital letter/ Scribbled by a child) whose thoughtful qualities journey beyond his earlier manner. From henceforth his varied work began to earn Anday official recognition. In particular his play Mikado‚Äônun √á√∂pleri (The Mikado Game) earned him several awards: Most Successful Playwright of the 1967‚Äì1968 Drama Season; the ƒ∞lhan ƒ∞skender Prize; Ankara Art Lovers Foundation for the Best Playwright in 1971‚Äì1972.A translation was included in An Anthology of Turkish Drama Vol.1, pp.271-324, Syracuse University 2008 Another play, √ñl√ºms√ºzler ya da Bir Cinayetin S√∂ylencesi (The Immortals or the Legend of a Murder) won the Enka Art Prize in 1980. His poetry collection Teknenin √ñl√ºm√º (Death of the Boat) won the 1978 Sedat Simavi Foundation Literature Prize, and √ñl√ºms√ºzl√ºk Ardinda Gilgamis (Gilgamesh Beyond Death) gained the 1981 T√ºrkiye ƒ∞≈ü Bankasƒ± Prize. In 1971 UNESCO honoured among him other outstanding European authors. He also received the T√úYAP Honour Prize for 1991 and the 2000 Aydin Dogan Foundation‚Äôs Literature Award.

It is one of three species in the mesite family or the Mesitornithidae, and though classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), it is the most widespread of the three. Description This species is a medium-sized terrestrial bird which is often described as rail-like (a family with which the mesites are sometimes placed). The species has a plain face, marked only by a slightly contrasting fleshy eye-ring around a rather large eye and a variable white streak behind the eye. It has a short straight bill. The upperparts of the bird are rufous brown, the underside tawny with no barring or spotting. Ecology The brown mesite is a humid forest species, it forages by walking through the forest floor flicking over leaf-litter in order to find invertebrates. Its rufous brown plumage provides reasonable camouflage on the shady forest floor. The preferred habitat is undisturbed deciduous forest from sea-level up to . One to three eggs are laid in a nest which consists of a loose platform made from twigs and lined with plant fibre and leaves. The eggs are dull white with brown markings on one end. Soon after hatching the chicks leave the nest. It is secretive and rarely seen. The brown mesite has never been observed flying; this may be simply due to its secretive habits, or it may be because it is in fact flightless.Roots, Clive. Flightless Birds. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2006. 136-37. Print. Distribution The brown mesite has a patchy distribution in humid evergreen forest along the eastern coast of Madagascar, from Marojejy National Park in the north to T√¥lanaro to the south. Status The population of this species is patchily distributed, and is vulnerable for preferring lower elevation forests which are under the greatest pressure from human disturbance. It is suspected that the population is rapidly declining because of predation by dogs, rats and by hunting. Its forests are also threatened by logging and subsistence agriculture. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the conservation status of this bird as ‚Ä≥vulnerable‚Ä≥.

Monklandsgate was the name of a political scandal in the former Scottish local government district of Monklands (now part of North Lanarkshire) which dominated the Monklands East by-election in 1994. Monklandsgate consisted of allegations of sectarianism spending discrepancies between Protestant Airdrie and Catholic Coatbridge, fuelled by the fact that all 17 of the ruling Labour group were Roman Catholics. Accusations included: ¬£21m spent on capital projects in Coatbridge while only ¬£2m was spent in Airdrie; councillors handing out green job application forms while the job centre handed out white ones; and also accusations of nepotism as dozens of council workers were related to Labour councillors. The accusations were of increased interest to the media as the Monklands West MP was Tom Clarke, former Monklands District Provost and one time Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, while the Monklands East MP was the Labour leader, John Smith. The allegations of sectarianism were found to be untrue, however allegations of nepotism proved to be true.

She spent most of her life in New Zealand and Britain.  Early life  She was born in Mudgee, New South Wales, Australia, to bank manager William Smoult Robison and his wife Mary, a literary and well-travelled relative of the Carr-Saunders family of Surrey. The family moved to Christchurch, New Zealand, an Anglican settlement founded on the colonizing principles of Edward Gibbon Wakefield in 1868. Maud, as she was always known, was one of the first pupils at the new Christchurch High School of girls.Alexander, Sally. \\"Reeves [n√©e Robison], Magdalen Stuart [known as Maud Pember Reeves] (1865‚Äì1953), suffragist and socialist.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. 2004-09-23. Oxford University Press.  Marriage and family  Described as tall and striking, with a handsome face, full red lips, dark eyes, and brown hair, Maud met her husband, William Pember Reeves at a coming-out ball when she was nineteen. Pember Reeves was a journalist, politician, and son of a newspaper proprietor, who \\"grew up an Englishman.\\" His vision for New Zealand was \\"no slums and no poverty\\". They married at Christchurch on 10 February 1885. The Reeves's first child, William, lived only a few hours. Their daughter Amber Reeves was born in 1887 and their second daughter, Beryl, in 1889. In December 1895 their son Fabian was born. Fabian (1895‚Äì1917) was killed in the First World War, aged 21 and a Flight Lieutenant in the RNAS. Maud's own household was unorthodox. In 1900 Maud's favourite sister, Effie Lascelles, recently widowed, moved in with her two daughters. Amber remembered a house filled with children, relatives, servants, nursemaids, \\"frightful rows\\" in the nursery, and her mother too busy to pay much attention to children. The Reeves marriage after the birth of Fabian was not intimate. William did not approve of birth control. The tensions in their marriage, H. G. Wells‚Äîwho until his affair with Amber was a close friend‚Äîwrote, were about money and birth control. When Amber, then a student at Cambridge, became pregnant by H. G. Wells‚Äîa public and political scandal‚ÄîMaud offended her daughter by suggesting an abortion.  Education, employment and suffrage  In the early years of their marriage Maud acted, assisted her mother-in-law in charitable works, and for three years was the lady editor of the weekly Canterbury Times, edited by her husband and owned by his father. In 1889, Maud took the first part of a BA in French, mathematics, and English at Canterbury College (founded in 1873). In 1890 the family moved to Wellington, where William Reeves had been a radical member of the house of representatives since 1887. Maud's studies were abandoned for her duties as the wife of a minister and suffragism. Maud was converted to women's suffrage by Julius Vogel, a former prime minister and friend of her husband. She had been president and founder of the women's section of the Christchurch Liberal Association. Education, she believed, would both convince women of the need to vote and civilize national debate. Although never a temperance advocate, Maud worked closely with Kate Sheppard, the Women's Christian Temperance Union's suffrage superintendent, and Ellen Ballance, the prime minister's wife, and she used her considerable charm to influence her husband's colleagues. In September 1893 New Zealand was the first country in the world to grant women the vote, and Maud chaired the first public meeting of enfranchised women in Christchurch on 11 October.  Fabian Women's Group  In 1896 the family moved to London after William's appointment as Agent-General, the representative of New Zealand government within the British Empire.Fry, Ruth. \\"Magdalene Stuart Reeves\\". Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Retrieved 23 April 2017. There, the couple became friends with a number of left-wing intellectuals, such as George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Maud joined the Fabian Society in 1904, a precursor to the Labour Party, which promoted social reform, the Women's Liberal Association, and the executive of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1906. At Maud's instigation the Fabian Society's statement of its basic aims included a clause on equal citizenship in 1907, when she was elected, with Ethel Bentham and Marian Phillips, to the society's executive committee. Maud founded the Fabian Women's Group with Charlotte Wilson in 1908. Held in Maud's Brunswick Gardens drawing-room early in 1908, after a winter of suffrage agitation. \\"the FWG intended both to give women more prominence in the Fabian Society and \\"to study women‚Äôs economic independence in relation to socialism.\\"Ross, Ellen. \\"Maud Pember Reeves\\". Slum Travelers: Ladies and London Poverty, 1860-1920, University of California Press, 2007, pp. 208‚Äì225. Member of the FWG included Beatrice Webb, Alice Clark, Edith Nesbit, Susan Lawrence, Margaret Bondfield, and Marion Phillips.  Round About a Pound a Week (1913)  Initiated by Maud in 1909, the FWG's Motherhood Special Fund Committee began a study of the domestic lives of families with new babies living on a subsistence wage of about a pound a week. The FWG had raised money and was able to give each mother extra cash for her children's food for their first year of life. The Fabians expected that the extra money would improve infant health and survival statistics for the sample group, which it definitely did‚Äîdemonstrating that high child death rates in slum areas were caused by poverty and not maternal ignorance or negligence. The Lambeth mothers' project was prompted by the recognition that more infants died in the London slums than in Kensington or Hampstead. It asked 'How does a working man's wife bring up a family on 20s a week?'. Forty-two families were selected from a lying-in hospital in Lambeth, London, to have weekly visits, medical examinations from Dr Ethel Bentham every two weeks, and 5s. to be paid to the mother for extra nourishment for three months before the birth of the baby and for one year afterwards. The mothers wrote down their weekly expenditure. Eight families withdrew because the husbands objected to this weekly scrutiny. Eight other mothers who could not read or write dictated their sums to their husbands or children. The verbatim accounts of the 'maternal manner of recollecting'‚Äî'Mr. G's wages was 19 bob out of that e took thruppons for es diner witch is not mutch e bein sutch an arty man'‚Äîis one of the features of the book which is in part an ironic comment on class relations: Lambeth women, familiar with the habits of educated visitors, politely anticipated sitting in draughts, listening to the gospel of porridge, and being advised against marriage. The conclusions from the project were first published in 1912 as a Fabian Tract and later became Maud's Round about a Pound a Week (1913). Poverty, the book argued, and neither maternal ignorance nor degeneration, caused ill health and high mortality. Had the children of Lambeth been 'well housed, well fed, well clothed and well tended from birth' who knows what they would have become. Fabian women were would-be lawmakers. The state must cast off its 'masculine' guise and 'co-parent'. The individual not the family should be the economic unit, and the state should pay family endowment, train midwives, make burial 'a free and honourable public service', introduce a legal minimum wage, and build clean, light, roomy buildings at economic rents for the working classes. If socialism should address the needs of working mothers then women themselves must want more: 'If people living on ¬£1 a week had lively imaginations, their lives, and perhaps the face of England, would be different.' Round about a Pound a Week is available via archive.org and was reprinted in 2008 by Persephone Books. Persephone's online description of the text states: > The reason the book remains unique is its mixture of factual rigour, wit and > polemic. As Polly Toynbee points out in her new Persephone Preface, one of > the most shocking facts to emerge is that 'the Fabian women deliberately > avoided the poorest families‚Ä¶ because they wanted to show how the general > standard of living among ordinary manual workers was below a level which > could support good health or nutrition.' Yet the book is consistently on the > side of the mothers; without being in any sense do-gooding it explains 'to a > middle-class world of power and condescension' that they could not do better > than they were doing on the tiny house-keeping allowance that their husbands > were able to give them. And it is about far more than how the women of > Lambeth 'managed'. It is full of the kind of human detail that is usually > only found in a novel. Polly Toynbee ends her preface by asking what Maud > Pember Reeves would think nowadays. She concludes that she would be proud of > the NHS and the welfare state but that she would be perplexed that the > inequalities between rich and poor are still so enormous.  Later life and death  In March 1917 Maud was appointed director of women's services in the Ministry of Food. Following the death of Fabian in June 1917 from wounds sustained during service in the First World War, Maud turned privately to spiritualism, and later to Higher Thought. From the early 1920s her participation in public life declined. She travelled to New Zealand with William in 1925, but while she had conversed with the London poor she had never met a Maori. She was a conscientious grandmother, and she nursed both William and her sister through their final illnesses. Amber described her mother as \\"serious-minded\\" and \\"obviously chaste to the last degree\\". Her focus on the needs of others was as austere as her prose, but the unflinching eye for detail and clamour of voices in Round about a Pound a Week dramatized both the \\"almost intolerable conditions\\" of women's daily lives and Fabian feminism's response. After twenty-one years as a widow, having lived with her sister Effie in Cambridge, Maud died in a nursing home at 27 Powis Gardens, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 13 September 1953.

Career details Hannah Fury began the self- teaching process of mastering the piano at the age of 16 after finding inspiration in a song which she described as having coalesced in her mind-- naming it \\"The Vampire Waltz.\\" By the early 1990s she initiated the process of producing and releasing her own music, starting with a four-song demo tape. Eventually the songs from this tape were developed into the self-released 1998 EP Soul Poison, soon followed by the full-length 2000 album, The Thing That Feels, which met with generally favorable critical notices. Seven years later, in August 2007, she released her second full-length album, and sixth CD overall, Through the Gash. All six of her CDs have been released on her own independent label MellowTraumatic Recordings. Despite not having the support of a major record label, her recordings have gained a devoted following who consistently praise her work. Noticeably shy of the limelight, Hannah Fury has never performed live. Musical style For most of her music, Hannah Fury has relied on vocals, keyboard and piano. She frequently uses overdubbing of her own voice to create harmonization and occasionally uses other instruments such as bass guitar. Starting with her CD Subterfuge, she has also introduced programmed drum machine to her instrumentation choice. She continues to use drum machines in Through the Gash. Reviewers of her work have compared her to Tori Amos, Kate Bush and Lisa Germano. Songwriting Long before Wicked was transformed into the same-titled Broadway musical, Fury composed and sang seven songs based on the original novel. Five of them appear on her first full-length CD album The Thing That Feels, a thirteen-song compilation released in 2000 ‚Äî the other two are included on the 2003 six-song single I Can't Let You In. Fury has said that she was particularly obsessed with the book's character of Elphaba. Hannah Fury's lyrics have also included references to such eclectic subject matter and imagery as the Marvel Comics character Man-Thing, matricide, mandrakes, caged birds, drowning and, most particularly, Marie Antoinette, who was mentioned in \\"The Necklace of Marie Antoinette\\" from Soul Poison, in \\"Carnival Justice (The Gloves Are Off) Part II\\" from Subterfuge, and in \\"Beware the Touch\\" from Through the Gash. In addition an illustration of Marie Antoinette has consistently appeared in merchandise sold in promotion of Fury's music. The connection to the French queen is further emphasized by the singer's website, which draws heavily on the aesthetics of the Rococo era, associated with Marie Antoinette and her Palace of Versailles. Fury has worked with artist Scott Radke, whose puppets appear on the cover of Fury's EP Subterfuge and are also featured in her video for the song \\"Carnival Justice (The Gloves Are Off) Part II\\" from the same CD. As well as writing, performing and producing her music, Hannah Fury also designs jewelry for her boutique collection. Personal life Fury married on September 21, 2017. She lost her husband to cancer in 2020. Fury stated that many of the songs on \\"Little Family\\" were inspired by his battle against the disease. Fury and her husband were involved in a near-fatal traffic collision in 2015.

Loving, a private in the United States Army, was sentenced to death following his conviction for murdering two military soldiers, working as part-time taxi drivers on December 12, 1988. He was stationed at Fort Hood, Texas at the time of the murders. Murders and arrest Dwight Jeffrey Loving was a native of Rochester, New York, born c. 1968. He was an Army Private First Class stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. On the night of December 11, 1988, he committed two armed robberies of convenience stores, netting less than $100. He then decided to rob some cab drivers. On December 12, during the course of those robberies, Loving murdered two taxicab drivers and attempted to murder a third. The court-martial evidence, which included Loving's undisputed videotaped confession, established that the first robbery and murder victim, Pvt. Christopher Fay, was an active duty soldier working for extra money as a cab driver; at approximately 8:00 p.m. on December 12, Fay drove Loving from Killeen, Texas, to a secluded area of Fort Hood, where Loving robbed him at gunpoint; after taking Fay's money, Loving shot Fay in the back of the head; while watching blood \\"gushing out\\" of Fay's head, Loving shot him in the back of the head a second time. Fay's dead body was discovered by another soldier at Fort Hood a short while later. Loving, after fleeing to his Fort Hood barracks, called for a second cab at 8:15 that same evening. The second cab, driven by retired Army Sergeant Bobby Sharbino, drove Loving from Fort Hood to a secluded street in Killeen. Loving then robbed Sharbino at gunpoint, ordered him to lie down on the seat, and murdered him by shooting him in the head. After the second murder, Loving socialized with his Italian girlfriend and others at local nightclubs. Later that evening, he robbed and attempted to murder a third cab driver, Howard Harrison, who successfully defended himself. Loving escaped on foot. The next day, a Joint Task Force composed of FBI, Texas Rangers and the US Army Criminal Investigation Division (USACIDC) agents pursued Loving. Army special agents arrested him and videotaped his confession. He reviewed the tape and signed a transcript of his confession. Trial, sentence, appeals, and commutation He was convicted at a court martial held at Ft. Hood in March 1989. He was found guilty on April 3, 1989. He made several attempts to have his sentence invalidated. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of his death sentence on June 3, 1996, in a decision by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Loving's attorneys had contended that the doctrine of separation of powers allowed only Congress rather than the President to define the \\"aggravating factors\\" that weighed in his sentencing. He lost a subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court in 2001. The lack of executions in the intervening decades was due to a Supreme Court decision in 1969 had held that the military did not have jurisdiction over crimes committed off-post by military personnel. The Supreme Court's reversal of that decision in 1987 made the possibility of military death sentences more likely. As they had in 1996, attorneys from the Cornell University Law School's Death Penalty Project were seeking further Supreme Court review of his case in November 2009, following his failure to persuade the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces that he had lacked adequate representation during the sentencing phase of his trial. Loving was not executed because neither President George W. Bush nor President Barack Obama authorized his execution. According to the New York Times, \\"Military executions require presidential approval\\". On January 17, 2017, three days before leaving office, President Obama commuted Loving's death sentence to life imprisonment without parole.

Taylor and Roderick Taylor, the film stars Eliza Dushku, Mike Vogel, Naike Rivelli and Lindsay Robba. Plot In the medieval era, a witch named Mamba is tortured and skinned alive in punishment for her crimes. Her skin and organs are then used to make a cursed game. A player who wins the game is granted a wish; however, a player losing the game is killed in a fashion predicted by the game. In the present day, Jason (Mike Vogel), while shopping with his friend Tomas (Iman Nazemzadeh) and Tomas' girlfriend Lisa (Lindsay Caroline Robba), acquires the board game from a handicapped shop owner called Malek (Alex O'Dogherty). The three friends travel back to Tomas' beachfront house, and at night a party occurs on the beach. Jason meets Erica (Eliza Dushku), before it begins to rain, causing most of the party-goers to leave; leaving behind only Jason, Erica, Tomas, Lisa, Elena (Naike Rivelli), Miguel (Ander Pardo) and Pablo (Boris Martinez). Erica suggests that the group should play the game, to which they all agree. However, Pablo is soon eliminated and takes Tomas' car to go to the shop and get beer. On his travel, Pablo stops to urinate, but falls over the edge of a cliff. He survives the fall, but is barely alive. A group of crabs then attacks him, gouging out his eyes and killing him. Meanwhile, Miguel, Lisa, Elena and Tomas also lose the game, before Detective Izar (Gary Piquer) arrives and informs the group of Pablo's death, cutting the game short. The group attend Pablo's funeral, where Erica realizes his death mirrors the games prediction. Soon after, Tomas, Lisa and Miguel travel to a wood-cutting factory (that belongs to Miguel's family but is currently empty) to have a photo shoot. While Lisa models, she feels unwell; she stops the photo shoot and leaves with Tomas. After their departure, Miguel is attacked by snakes. He attempts to climb a stack of logs, but a snake bites him and he falls into a large group of snakes that kill him with their venomous bites. Meanwhile, Jason and Erica start up a romance. While they are in Jason's car they witness ghostly versions of Pablo and Miguel, before receiving a call from Tomas telling them of Miguel's death. Jason and Erica meet Tomas, Lisa and Elena at Tomas' apartment, where they tell the others they suspect the group are dying because of the game. Tomas, Lisa and Elena remain skeptical, however. After Jason, Erica and Elena have left, Lisa becomes more ill. Tomas tends to her, before the pair go to bed. The following morning, Lisa has aged into an old woman and is rushed to hospital. Jason, Erica and Elena arrive at the hospital and tell Detective Izar their theory about the game. They then go in to see Lisa. Elena becomes distraught at her appearance and about her friends' deaths, and leaves despite Tomas' attempts to get her to stay. Lisa soon dies, prompting Jason, Erica and Tomas to seek answers from Malek. They find Malek at his home, but he is no longer handicapped. He explains to them that he won the game and wished to no longer be handicapped. Meanwhile, Elena is traveling home to Milan in her car when she is involved in a car accident. Her car leaks gas, and a broken electrical wire ignites it, burning her to death. Jason, Erica and Tomas go to Jason's house, where they find Detective Izar looking for the game. Jason and Erica escape with it, but Tomas is caught by the Detective, who puts him in the trunk of his car. Later, Jason receives a call from the Detective demanding the game in return for Tomas, but Tomas attempts to escape and the Detective shoots him dead. At Tomas' beachfront house, Jason and Erica decide to play the game in the hope that they can win and wish for it to be a week in the past, so that their friends will be alive. Erica is eliminated, and realizes her death will involve the sea. Jason wins the game, and will get his wish as long as he passes the game onto another person. Jason and Erica go to bed, but Erica discovers she must die for Jason to get his wish, so she enters the sea. Jason wakes up and rushes out to save her, but Detective Izar shows up, takes the game away and leaves with it. Erica then emerges from the sea and reveals herself to be Mamba, granting Jason his wish that they have never played the game. However, Jason and his friends now become trapped, forced to relive the week again and again.

The game consists of a wooden case with a dragonfly motif, a board with sequential spaces laid out in a spiral, an instruction sheet, small wooden playing pieces, two dice, a set of cards, and a central tower with two snakes and a dial. The object of the game is for a player to get their playing piece to the center space, and then place that piece in the correct snake's mouth. Spaces are either safety spots known as \\"Windows of Heaven\\" or spaces with Grim Reapers shown known as \\"Open Graves\\", which cause the player to draw a card. If the card is an Epitaph (a card with the words Vae Victis written below), the player who drew it is dead. If the card is not an Epitaph card, that player is safe. Even if all but one player is dead, that player must continue playing until they reach the center. They do not need to reach the center space by exact count. Once there, they must ask the tower one question and place the playing piece in either the mouth of the black snake Spatium (Space) or of the white snake Tempus (Time). If they choose correctly, their wish comes true. If they choose wrongly, they suffer the same fate as the witch: being skinned alive. Even if they choose correctly, the wish does not come true until all the players are dead from the effects of the Epitaph cards drawn during the game and the game is passed onto someone else.

They were led by Tali White on lead vocals (of the Lucksmiths), initially as a side project, from 2001. They released three albums Private Transport (2002), Inner North (2004) and Speak Up (2008). In 2012 the group disbanded but occasionally reformed for one-off performances.  History  The Guild League were formed in 2001 as an indie pop, side project in Melbourne by Tali White on lead vocals (also in the Lucksmiths). They issued a three-track extended play, Jet-set...Go! in 2002 via Matin√©e Records. One of the other musicians was Richard Easton on guitar. Karen E Graves of AllMusic observed it was \\"a teaser for things yet to come... [the group] exist in a world of delightful acoustic pop, drawn out in exquisite detail by White's quirky travelog-style lyrics.\\" Their first album, Private Transport (2002), is credited to 16 musicians from Australia and the United States. White provided lead vocals, drums, guitar, percussion and piano. He explained to Kath Ogovany of Australian Music Info how \\"I was in San Francisco for about four months and in between some Lucksmiths tours and had some time on my hands and had some friends who were willing to muck around so we started recording this album there and when I got back to Australia The Luckies were having a pretty relaxed sort of year‚Ä¶ so I recorded the rest of it with a whole lot of good friends here.\\" Private Transport was issued through Matin√©e in United States and the now-defunct Candle Records in Australia. It included the track, \\"Siamese Couplets\\", which featured \\"Australian-accented rapping\\". While the album's last track, \\"A Faraway Place\\", was \\"a dazzling near-a cappella tune.\\" Aside from Easton and White, fellow musicians included Clare Bowditch on backing vocals, Marty Brown on drums (of Clare Bowditch Band, Art of Fighting), Pete Cohen on bass guitar, double bass and backing vocals (of Sodastream), Brent Kenji on guitar (of the Fairways), Jaime Knight on guitar (of #Poundsign#, Dear Nora), Craig Pilkington on guitar (of the Killjoys), and Alicia Vanden Heuvel on bass guitar (of #Poundsign#, the Aislers Set). The band had reduced in size by 2004 when their second album Inner North was released. It was recorded by the line- up of Brown, Pilkington, White, Cressida Griffith on cello and bass, Rodrigo Pintos-Lopez on guitar and Gus Rigby on tenor saxophone and baritone saxophone. AllMusic's James Christopher Monger rated it at four-out-of-five stars and opined \\"beautiful and fluid Inner North. Sophomore records are notoriously spotty, if only because the listener's first exposure to the group is their only frame of reference, so when a loosely assembled 'supergroup' puts out a second record that sounds like a veteran, joined-at-the-hip 'band,' it's all the more impressive.\\" In November 2006 the line-up was Griffith, Rigby and White with Roger Clark on trumpet, Phil Collings on drums and Gerry Eeman on guitar (also in Basic Shape). They issued their third album, Speak Up, on 12 October 2008. An editorial review at Amazon.com states it \\"is the sound of a band full of optimism and new ideas. There s a little bit for everyone... [it] mixes guitars with strings, keyboards, bursts of trumpet and saxophone, wonderful female backing vocals, and handclaps, all complemented by Tali's crystal clear and perfectly pitched vocals.\\" White is the main songwriter for the band, writing all lyrics. Music is written either solely by White, or in collaboration with others including Pintos-Lopez, Eeman or Collings. Aaron Zelinsky claimed in March 2009 on his blog for Huffington Post that US President Barack Obama had adapted the lyric, \\"The quiet burden of your absence\\", from the Guild League's song, \\"Shirtless Sky\\" from Inner North, in his inaugural address to Congress. By May 2011 the group were rarely playing together, White told Jack Franklin of The Beat magazine how there are \\"six of us in the band and all of us have hundreds of other things on our plates, so it's always a big joy when we can get together. It's just going to be fun to play the songs again. We still really love playing them ‚Äì they're good songs ‚Äì so hopefully people come along and hear them, yeah. We would love to get another gig in this year but I've got a baby on the way and Cressida (cellist/bassist) had a child in February, so we're very new to that; Phil's (drums) got another kid on the way so, there's a lot of kids going on ‚Äì but we will try and get another gig in this year if possible.\\" Discography = Albums = * Private Transport (2002) * Inner North (2004) * Speak Up (2008) = Extended plays = * Jet-set...Go!

It is one of three species in the mesite family Mesitornithidae, and is restricted in distribution to a small low-land region in southwest Madagascar. Description The subdesert mesite is a medium-sized terrestrial bird which is often described as rail-like (a family with which the mesites are sometimes placed). The species has a long and downward-curved bill distinguishing it from the other members of the family. Both sexes are greyish above and show thin white eyebrows. Both have white underparts; the male has black crescent-shaped spots on the side of the neck and upper breast. The female has rufous spots that may merge into a general rufous tone, and has a tawny cheek patch. Distribution and habitat The subdesert mesite is restricted to spiny thicket with open areas, from sea-level to an altitude of . It is restricted to the long, and wide, coastal strip between the Fiherenana river and the Mangoky river, in the south-west of Madagascar. To the north of Manombo there is an area of circa where the habitat is still suitable; elsewhere the habitat is becoming fragmented. Behaviour and ecology The subdesert mesite forages by picking invertebrates, seeds and fruit off the ground and may dig into the surface. The birds nests are exposed platforms of twigs built in a bush within of the ground. One or two eggs are laid and the incubation and care of the young is shared by both sexes. They may be polyandrous or polygynous. The birds live in communal groups and have a loud ‚Ä≥nak! nak!‚Ä≥ alarm call when disturbed. Status The population of this species may be dense within its restricted geographic range. It is vulnerable to habitat degradation, by slash-and-burn cultivation of maize, burning for charcoal, commercial timber and for construction. which is happening in most of its range apart from to the north of Manombo. The birds are also taken by dogs, by hunting, and introduced rats (Rattus sp) may also be a problem. In 2002 there was an estimated population 115,000 and it is estimated that numbers are falling. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the conservation status of this bird as ‚Ä≥vulnerable‚Ä≥.

An inscription on the arch records that it was constructed in the year of the Battle of Waterloo, but although designed and constructed in 1815, its erection was not completed until the following year.

The bridge is made wholly from cast iron, apart from the stone bastions, and was only the seventh such bridge to be built. In 1923, the bridge‚Äôs masonry abutments were refurbished, and its superstructure was strengthened by encasing the inner three ribs in concrete. A reinforced cantilevered concrete deck was also added, which provided extra space for new footways; the cast iron parapet railings were re-erected on the outside of the new footways.

The sexes are dissimilar but both have elongated wings. The uppersides of the male forewing are orange bordered with brown and have a large four sided black stigma. The color of the uppersides of the female wings are dark brown with golden spots in the center but are highly variable, light to very dark.

Females can always be identified by the square white transparent spot at the end of the forewing cell. Underside of wings on both sexes are variable but the female hindwing is brown with light colored four- sided spots. The sachem is often mistaken for other skipper butterflies in the genus Hesperia.

During the warmer North American months, it can be found in northern parts of North America up to Montana, Washington, and New York excluding most of the Rocky Mountains. One was sighted and photographed in southern Manitoba, Canada, on July 11, 2015. Strays have been reported in British Columbia, Canada, three times, once each in 1937, 1953, and 1960. Atalopedes campestris can be found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, lawns, pastures, parks, oil fields, and landfills. It had been observed that the sachem expanded its range northward rapidly during the beginning of the 21st century. A study by Crozier shows that this expansion is due to the winter warming trend of climate change rather than evolution of cold tolerance for this species.  Life cycle  The sachem butterfly undergoes fours stages of complete metamorphosis: = Eggs = Eggs are greenish-white and are laid singly on or near the host plant leaves. The height of the egg is . The width of the egg is . The egg has polygonal sculpturing on its surface. = Larvae = The Atalopedes campestris larva (or caterpillar) goes through five stages called instars. Each caterpillar must shed its exoskeleton in order to grow. Differences between instars can be seen in altered body proportions, colors, patterns, changes in the number of body segments, or head width. Larvae of the Family Hesperiidae \\"have a head, three thoracic segments, and ten abdominal segments.\\" Each segment in the thorax has a pair of true legs. Segments three to six and ten in the abdomen have prolegs. Respiration openings, called spiracles, can be found on the first segment of the thorax and segments one to eight of the abdomen. The last abdominal segment, segment ten, features an anal comb. The anal comb is shaped like a fan and located near the anus to launch the caterpillar excrement, or frass, away from the caterpillar. Sometimes the frass is propelled several feet away. The sachem caterpillar's head is black. Its body is dark olive green with black dots or bumps and a dark dorsal line. The legs are brown. The length of the larvae in the last instar varies from . The larvae construct nests made of a host plant leaf (or leaves) and silk that they excrete. They build new shelters as they grow and move through their different instars. The larvae spend most of their lives in these shelters. = Pupa = The sachem larva pupates in the same silked-leaf nest where it spends most of its life. The pupa is dark brown, almost black and is cream colored on the end of the abdomen which has brown dots. The proboscis extends beyond the wings. The length of the pupa is with a width of . The pupae of hesperiid have the same basic structure as the larvae‚Äîa head, three thoracic segments, and ten abdominal segments. The last abdominal segment is modified into the cremaster which is used to cement the pupa to the nest. Before an adult butterfly emerges from the pupa, the legs, wing, and antennae of the butterfly can be seen in the pupa; these are cemented to the body. = Adult = An adult butterfly emerges from the pupa. The time that adult sachems take flight, mate, and the female lays fertilized eggs is known as a flight. This happens three times, May through November, in the northern part of their range. In the southern part of their range, flights occur four to five times, March through December. Males perch on grasses during the day to await females. Migration occurs to the north and only one mass migration is known to occur in late summer.  Larval host plants  The host plants used by the sachem caterpillar are various grasses including Bermuda grass, hairy crabgrass, red fescue, St. Augustine grass, Indian goosegrass, seashore saltgrass, and Imperata cylindrica.

It is a full-sized ISA compatibility card, and unlike other such add-ons, it does not emulate a 3DO system, but rather the whole system's logic board is included, with the input (controllers) and output (video & audio) redirected to the PC. The product was marketed as a single board for CD-ROM drive owners (but only drives with a Panasonic interface) or bundled with the necessary CD-ROM drive. The software drivers allowed for Windows (3.1) based gameplay, which featured real-time stretching of the game window and screenshot capturing. As graphics boards of the time (1994) were not up to par with the system's needs, a pass-through using a VGA feature connector link was used, thus reserving an area on screen to be used by the 3DO Blaster card's output. Thus, there was no impact on the CPU. As with the first 3DO system from Panasonic (REAL FZ-1) an FMV daughter-card enabling Video CD playback was planned, but since the 3DO Blaster failed to achieve momentum, it was never released. Saved games were stored in NVRAM on the card. Bundle contents The card was sold with the cables needed, a 3DO controller by Logitech, and two 3DO games on CD: \\"Shock Wave\\" from Electronic Arts and \\"Gridders\\" from Tetragon. Despite showing the 'long boxes' of the two games on the back of the packing box, they were included in jewel cases only. A third CD, containing demos of popular 3DO games was also included.

The World 7 team featured Kath Harby (Australia), Elaine Davis (Jamaica), Leana Du Plooy (South Africa) and Vilimaina Davu (Fiji) and Team Pasifika. She moved to New Zealand in 2000 and quickly established herself in the Silver Ferns defence circle. During her Silver Ferns career, Davu became well known for her tough defensive style and frequent contact penalties. She also won the Fijian Sportswoman of the Year in 2000.http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=52202 Vilimaina won Sports Personality of the Year by Sport Canterbury for netball in 2002.

Since then Kecoughtan has been used as an educational facility for high school students in the Fox Hill area, a major neighborhood in the Hampton Roads region. Kecoughtan is the only high school near the neighborhood. The word Kecoughtan comes from the name of the Virginia Algonquian Native Americans living there when the English colonists arrived in the Hampton Roads area in 1607. The Native Americans were originally named Kikotan (also spelled Kiccowtan, Kikowtan etc.) The first academic school year was 1963-64. Since the school was built to handle the overflow of Hampton High School students who were previously enrolled as sophomores at Hampton High School were enrolled as juniors at Kecoughtan High School.

The lake reaches depths of nearly . It is located east-southeast of the city of Almaty and is above sea level. History Lake Kaindy is located in the south of Kazakhstan, within Kolsai Lakes National Park. It is located above sea level, east of Almaty. The lake was formed as the result of a major limestone landslide triggered by the 1911 Kebin earthquake forming a natural dam. It blocked the gorge and was filled by mountain river water. Lake Kaindy is about 400 meters long, reaching depths of nearly 30 meters at its deepest point. Altered by limestone deposits, the water maintains a bluish-green color. The lake contains trunks of submerged Picea schrenkiana trees that rise above the surface of the lake. The area is often referred to as a \\"sunken forest\\". The cold water helps preserve the tree trunks, which are overgrown with algae and various other water plants. In recent years, Lake Kaindy has become a popular international tourist destination. The lake is also known for ice diving and trout fishing in the winter season. The uniqueness of the lake lies in the fact that after the emergence of a natural dam that blocked the gorge, the water that filled the dam formed the lake and did not destroy the spruce trees growing in this place along the river. (The Kaindy river flows into the lake, passing through a two- sided rock face about 20 meters high). The upper part of the trees protruding from the water lost their side branches and bark, and the wood turned white. When you look at such a panorama, you get the feeling that you are looking at a submerged squadron: the bare trunks of trees resemble the masts of submerged ships. The lake surface itself changes color regularly and is often a very beautiful blue color. This strange color is caused by lime and other minerals that were in the water a hundred years ago. But as soon as you get closer to the lake, the water becomes crystal clear, and sometimes you can even see trout in it. Despite the low water temperature, Kaindy lake is popular with diving enthusiasts.

It has 22,824 inhabitants per the , and is the head town of the Nogoy√° Department. It lies in the southwest of the province, by the Nogoy√° Stream (a tributary of the Paran√° River), about 95 km southeast from the provincial capital Paran√°, on National Route 12. The main economic activity in the area is the dairy industry (producing milk and cheese), which makes Nogoy√° the unofficial dairy capital in Entre R√≠os. Agriculture is also significant, featuring wheat, corn, sorghum, sunflower and soybean crops. History View of the city in 1887. At left background, the \\"Bas√≠lica Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen\\". The town started as an informal settlement by the Nogoy√° River around 1760. Its name means \\"Wild Water\\". A chapel was built by Father Fernando Andr√©s Quiroga y Taboada to serve the region in 1782; this place of worship (today the Basilica of Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen) served as a focal point for more settlers, and is considered the foundational event of Nogoy√°. Nogoy√° was recognized as a town in 1826. There is no exact date for the anniversary of the foundation, but locals observe City Celebration Day on July 16, the same day that Roman Catholics celebrate the Virgin under the invocation of \\"Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen;\\" She is considered the spiritual mother of the town. Every year, on July 16, the venerated image is taken out of the temple and carried by volunteers through the streets of Nogoy√°, followed by thousands of pilgrims. At the end of her pilgrimage, it is returned to the Basilica receiving a salute of white tissues shaken in the air by the multitude. The image is honored with a special crown, called Alianza de las Alianzas (\\"alliance of alliances\\"), made of gold and jewelry, including wedding rings, offered up by settlers. The brother of provincial caudillo Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, Cipriano Urquiza, was murdered in Nogoy√° in 1844. Assigned its own Partido, or county, in 1849, and made its capital, the town was the seat of the Convention that reformed the Constitution of Entre R√≠os in 1860. The Entre R√≠os Central Railway arrived in Nogoy√° in 1887. A center of cattle ranching in the 19th century, the area around Nogoy√° would be home to a growing number of dairy farms during the 20th. La Sibila, the largest dairy established in subsequent years, would grow to process over 1,000,000 liters of powdered milk a day, and remains the town's largest employer. Other important installations include a Molinos R√≠o de la Plata mill, Nogopaint, and a microbrewery, Cerveza Nogoy√°. The city's economy was further bolstered by the 2003 completion of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, giving Nogoy√° a direct highway link to Rosario.

It starts in A Coru√±a and runs south past the cities of Santiago de Compostela, Pontevedra and Vigo, before ending at the town of Tui, a few kilometres north of the Portuguese border at the Minho River. The AP-9 is 178 km (111 miles) in length. The first 16 km (10 miles), from A Coru√±a to the A-6 autov√≠a near the towns of Gu√≠samo and Betanzos, form part of European route E70, while the remainder forms part of European route E01. Between A Coru√±a and Vigo, the motorway runs parallel to the N-550 road, and between Vigo and Tui it runs parallel to the A-55 autov√≠a . The AP-9 has two spurs: the 36 km (22.5 mile) long AP-9F from Gu√≠samo to Ferrol, which runs parallel to the N-651 road and also forms part of European route E01; and the 4 km (2.5 mile) long AP-9V, which runs into the centre of Vigo. History Construction of the motorway, originally known as the A-9, began in the mid-1970s with the section between Pontevedra and Vigo, including the Rande Bridge, and also the section between A Coru√±a and Santiago de Compostela. The latter opened in 1979, the former two years later. Between 1988 and 1992, these two sections were gradually linked. In 1994, construction of the spur to Ferrol commenced. In the late 1990s, the A-9 was extended from Vigo to what is now the junction with the Autoestrada AG-57. Then, in the early 2000s, it was extended from this point to Tui. The spur to Ferrol was completed in 2003, and in the same year the A-9 was redesignated the AP-9, as part of the general redesignation of Spanish autopistas and autov√≠as.

Plot Wilbur Hoolihan (Lou Costello) accidentally kills a hack horse owned by King O'Hara (Cecil Kellaway) and his daughter, Princess (Patsy O'Connor) by feeding it candy. In hopes of raising enough money to replace it, he and his friend Grover Mockridge (Bud Abbott) visit a gambling parlor. They are successful in raising the money, but before they can purchase a new horse, a con man swindles Wilbur out of his cash. They are informed by some touts that an old horse is available for nothing at one of the tracks. They visit the track and mistakenly take the wrong horse, a champion by the name of Tea Biscuit. They present the horse to O'Hara as a replacement for his deceased horse. The horse's real owner, Col. Brainard (Samuel Hinds), offers a reward for Tea Biscuit. By this time O'Hara has taken a fare up to Saratoga. Wilbur and Grover, realizing their error, drive to Saratoga. The three touts also realize that Wilbur and Grover took Tea Biscuit, and trail them hoping to recover the horse and collect the reward. Wilbur and Grover manage to find O'Hara and hide Tea Biscuit in their hotel room, but they are hounded by the house detective, Warner (Eugene Pallette), who was tipped off by the touts. Wilbur and Grover head to the race track in time for a big race. Grover makes a deal with Warner: for $100 he will give him the horse Wilbur rides. Grover then uses that money to bet on Tea Biscuit. Before the race, Wilbur is thrown off Tea Biscuit and lands on Rhubarb. Tea Biscuit, with a real jockey aboard, wins the race. Wilbur rides Rhubarb and loses. Warner and the touts take Wilbur's horse, which they believe is Tea Biscuit, to Col. Brainard for the reward, but it is the wrong horse. Grover holds the only winning ticket on Tea Biscuit, and uses their winnings to buy O'Hara a real replacement horse.

It took effect on April 1, 1896, was amended in 1917 and repealed in 1923. History Among other provisions, the Raines law increased the cost of liquor licenses, raised the drinking age from sixteen to eighteen, and prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sundays except in hotels, as well as in lodging houses with at least 10 rooms that served drinks with complimentary meals.J. Raines. The Raines Liquor-Tax Law, The North American Review, Vol. 162, No. 473 (Apr., 1896), pp. 481-485 Most men worked a six-day week, and Sunday was the only free day for recreation, so the new law was not very popular. Answering the demand, saloon owners quickly found a loophole by adding small slightly furnished rooms, complimentary food and applying for a hotel license since state statutes seemingly allowed that any business was considered a hotel if it had 10 rooms for lodging and served at least sandwiches with its liquor. =Raines sandwiches= Free lunch, by Charles Dana Gibson. The meal requirement was met by the cheapest sandwich available, sometimes reused across tables, or sandwiches made of rubber. Jacob Riis wrote in 1902 of saloon keepers who mocked the law by setting out \\"brick sandwiches,\\" two pieces of bread with a brick in between, thus fulfilling the legal requirement of serving food. He also writes of altercation in a saloon where a customer attempted to eat a sandwich that the bartender had served just for show; \\"the police restored the sandwich to the bartender and made no arrests.\\", p. 224 =Raines law hotels= Scores of \\"Raines law hotels,\\" often located directly above saloons, opened.The Raines Law Hotel and the Social Evil, by Committee of Fifteen.

The name was abbreviated officially to B.N.F.M.R.A. (the organisation was normally known as ‚ÄòThe BNF‚Äô during its life). It was formed in 1920 by members of the British Non-Ferrous Metals Federation which represented the commercial interests of British manufacturers of coppers and copper alloys, lead, zinc and other non-ferrous metals and their alloys, latterly including titanium. Robert Hutton was appointed director in 1921. Membership The 600 or so subscribing members formed Industry Committees representing each of the main metal interests which discussed and agreed the topics for technical work to be done and a Council that controlled overall finances. Initially there was an annual government grant towards the work but this was changed to support funding for individual projects. When topics for research were agreed and funded by the industry they were then submitted to the government for approval of matching support funding but after the 1960s policy dictated that this became more and more difficult to obtain. The BNF also took on some contracts wholly sponsored by organisations which included some government departments. Individual technical enquiries from members were answered on a free and confidential basis. Laboratories For many years after the new art deco fronted building was opened in 1939 the work was carried out in laboratories fronting on Euston Street, London, NW1. These included three parallel four-story blocks of laboratories and offices with the basements being used for the heaviest equipment and for storage of samples. The Euston Street building was extended to the right of the main entrance making the address 81‚Äì103 Euston Street, N W 1, with the laboratories behind being in Regnart Buildings and Euston Buildings which fronted on Stephenson Street. The extension was opened on 13th May 1959 by Sir Alexander Fleck. In the mid 1950s the Duke of Edinburgh toured all departments. The laboratories were grouped in specialist sections, including Analytical Chemistry, Corrosion, Creep Testing, Electroplating, Fatigue Testing, General Metallurgy, Information Library, Mechanical Testing, Melting and Casting, Members Liaison, Metallography, Metal Working, Physics (X-ray crystallography), Spectrography. The laboratories were an excellent training ground both for assistants who studied for their qualifications part- time and for recent graduates from universities. As such members found that staff could be ideal recruits for industrial work. There were 150‚Äì200 staff and the average time for researchers to stay was about three years and they could then be found in industries in Britain and worldwide. From the late 1930s to the 1960s through the war and then post-war recovery the Director was Mr G. L. Bailey with Miss E. M. (Helen) Hills as his secretary. Reports There was a quarterly report on each research topic presented to the individual research committee and an annual one circulated also to members on request. Final results were compiled as a report that was immediately available to members. After about two years the commercial confidentiality was dropped and a paper was presented at a meeting of the Institute of Metals or other organisation and subsequently published in their Journal. Some researches that had resulted in valuable definitive advancements were then published in book form. Wartime work Much of the work done by the BNF during the 1939‚Äì45 period was of vital use for the defence industry. This especially included solving many of the corrosion problems of seawater cooled condenser tubes and tube plates that had resulted in many ships being unserviceable and significant improvements in corrosion resistant alloys for seawater pumps and pipe fittings. No work was ever carried out on active materials for nuclear weapons. Some consultancy work was undertaken on paperwork for new designs. There has been much publicity about Melita Norwood (n√©e Sirnis) who joined the BNF in 1932 as a clerk, was eventually promoted to secretary and retired 1972. As secretary to a Research Superintendent she had access to the papers prepared at the BNF for presentation to the research committees and some contractors. Some of these she chose to copy to Russian intelligence. This information was made use of by them and did occasionally result in one of their research organisations publishing development work on non-ferrous metals similar to and sooner than the BNF in Britain. BNF- Fulmer During the 1970s the BNF became the BNF Metals Technology Centre and moved out of London to Grove Laboratories, Denchworth Road, Wantage, Oxfordshire. Recognising globalisation, membership was then opened to companies based overseas. In 1990 the BNF bought Fulmer Research Laboratories from the Institute of Physics and was renamed the BNF-Fulmer, then BNF (Fulmer Materials Centre). The laboratories were closed in 1992.

Named for former company president E.C. Marshall, the station is located on Lake Norman and began commercial operation in 1965. Marshall is the second largest coal facility owned by Duke Energy in the Carolinas. It generates enough electricity (2.09 GW) to power approximately two million homes. The plant consists of four units. The first two, at 350 MWe each, were launched in 1965 and 1966. The other two units, at 648 MWe each, were launched in 1969 and 1970. A unique type of burner arrangement in the boilers keeps the nitrogen oxide emissions from the Marshall facility well below regulatory limits. In 2004, Duke Energy began installing scrubbers, which will lower the station's sulfur dioxide emissions by approximately 95 percent. The project was completed in late 2007. On December 11, 2014, Duke Energy, to repair a rusted, leaking pipe, received approval from North Carolina to dump Coal Ash (containing arsenic, lead, thallium and mercury, among other heavy metals) from the Marshall Steam Station into Lake Norman.http://www.hickoryrecord.com/news/duke-to-repair-leaky-pipe-at-coal- ash-dump-in/article_2bd33b10-8185-11e4-989c-e347c5127e28.html A combination of factors has led to elevated levels of trihalomethanes, or THMs, in eight of the 12 water sampling stations around Charlotte, according to regularly scheduled water tests in August 2015. A Duke Energy spokeswoman called the utility's use of bromide cleaners at two area coal plants a \\"triggering event\\" contributing to the increase in THMs since January 2014. In 2013, Duke started using calcium bromide at Allen Steam Station in Gaston County and Marshall Steam Station in Catawba County to meet federal air-quality rules, including the removal of mercury. In May 2015, Duke stopped using bromide as a cleaner [Duke Energy has not yet commented on what they have replaced it with]. These effects are unrelated to continuing concerns over the disposal of coal-ash and its impact on drinking water.http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/queen_city_agenda/2015/08/duke- energy-city-water-quality-concerns-but- still.html?ana=e_vert_st_20150817http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/08/duke- energy-tests-show-ash-ponds-don-t- effect.html?ana=e_du_pub&s;=article_du&ed;=2015-08-25&u;=jFGEoJyeJYHFwZ4W/oMBM4H/9NF&t;=1440530902 Groundwater at Marshall, north of Charlotte, does flow toward Lake Norman, and the contaminated field abuts the lake for about 30 feet of shoreline near its largest ash basin.http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/09/duke-energy- completes-groundwater-contamination.html On October 3, 2015, Duke reported that a sinkhole had formed at the base of the Marshall Steam Station dam north of Charlotte on Lake Norman.

Incident  Police stated that the bus went over the side of the road after a car driven by another Lee High student tried to swerve around the bus, causing the bus driver to swerve going over the edge of the elevated roadway. The driver was ejected from the bus before it went over the side of the bridge, as he was not wearing a seat belt. The bus hit the 32-inch-high cement bridge rail and rode the top of the rail for 117 feet before it plunged over the side. Four students were killed and 23 were injured after the bus plunged almost . Of the four, all were female students who ranged in age from 16 to 19 years-old.  Aftermath  The crash was extensively covered by CNN and USA Today. A photograph of James \\"Rusty\\" Edward Moore Jr. sitting next to his girlfriend who was covered by a blanket went viral, as many thought Moore Jr was sitting next to a dead body. The girlfriend however was just resting and cold. The crash reignited debate over the installation of seat belts in buses, and whether Alabama should follow the lead of states such as Florida in legislating compulsory lap belts. Following the crash Alabama Governor Bob Riley ordered a report be made into the issue. A study group consisting of education and transport officials interviewed 17 expert witnesses, and in early 2007 released recommendations that a pilot program be run with lap and shoulder belts being installed in a limited number of new buses from 2008. A similar accident occurred on November 21, 2016, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where a school bus driver lost control of a bus, causing it to roll over on its side and crash into a tree, killing six students and injuring 23.

The southern terminus is at PA 23 in East Earl Township. The northern terminus is U.S. Route 222 Business (US 222 Bus.) in Reading. PA 625 is a two-lane undivided road its entire length. The route runs through rural areas in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country of northeastern Lancaster County, passing through Bowmansville. PA 625 continues into Berks County and runs through more rural areas, intersecting PA 568 in Knauers before coming to a junction with PA 724. Past this intersection, the route heads into developed areas and passes through Kenhorst before coming to its northern terminus. The route was designated as the westernmost of segment of PA 73 in 1928, which continued past Reading to Philadelphia. By 1940, the entire length of PA 73 between Blue Ball and Reading was completely paved. PA 625 was designated onto its current alignment by 1966 following the rerouting of PA 73 to its current terminus at Leesport. Route description PA 625 begins at an intersection with PA 23 west of the village of Goodville and east of Blue Ball in East Earl Township, Lancaster County, heading north on two-lane undivided Reading Road. The route passes through the Pennsylvania Dutch Country of eastern Lancaster County, which is home to many Amish farms. The road heads through agricultural areas with some homes, passing to the east of an industrial complex before crossing the Conestoga River. The route curves northeast through more farmland with a few trees and residences and turns north to cross Black Creek into Brecknock Township. PA 625 continues through rural areas with some development before it runs through the residential community of Bowmansville. North of Bowmansville, the road passes under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76). The route runs through a mix of farms, trees, and residential and commercial development to the east of parallel Muddy Creek, curving to the northeast. PA 625 enters Brecknock Township in Berks County and becomes New Holland Road, crossing Muddy Creek and passing through forested areas with some homes. The road runs through a mix of woods, fields, and residences as it reaches a junction with PA 568 in the community of Knauers. The route continues through rural land with some development and turns east to cross into Cumru Township. PA 625 curves northeast and becomes parallel to Angelica Creek, running through wooded areas with some homes and passing to the east of a golf course. The road winds north through forests and forms the eastern border of Nolde Forest Environmental Education Center. The route continues through woodland and comes to an intersection with PA 724, at which point PA 724 Truck follows the route. Past this intersection, PA 625 enters the borough of Kenhorst and passes businesses before it continues north through residential and commercial areas. The road curves northeast and continues past more homes. PA 625 continues into the city of Reading and soon comes to its northern terminus at US 222 Bus. southwest of the downtown area. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, present-day PA 625 was not designated as part of a route. In 1928, the road between PA 23 in Blue Ball and Reading was designated as the westernmost part of PA 73, which continued through Reading northeast to Oley and southeast to Philadelphia. At this time, a portion of the road south of Reading was paved while the remainder south to Blue Ball was unpaved. By 1930, PA 73 was paved in the Bowmansville area and from south of Reading to south of Angelica; the remainder of the route between Blue Ball and Reading was under construction at this time. The entire length of road was paved by 1940. By 1966, PA 73 was realigned to head from Oley to Leesport, and PA 625 was designated on the former alignment between PA 23 in Blue Ball and US 222 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading. PA 625 has remained on the same alignment since. Major intersections PA 625 Truck Pennsylvania Route 625 Truck (PA 625 Truck) is a truck route of PA 625 that bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over Angelica Creek in Cumru Township, on which trucks over 32 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The route follows PA 568, US 222, US 222 Bus., and PA 724. It was signed in 2013.

Portrayed by Camryn Grimes, the character was introduced in 1997 by William J. Bell as the biological daughter of Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) whom she had given up for adoption. Grace Turner (Jennifer Gareis), Sharon's best friend, tracked Cassie down in hopes of reuniting her with Sharon, but decided to keep the girl for herself. A year passed before Sharon learned Cassie was her daughter, regaining custody with her husband Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), who adopted her. In 2005, the producers decided to kill off Cassie by having her die from injuries sustained in a car accident. The character's death was felt in storyline for years to follow, leading to the dissolution of her parents' marriage and numerous events thereafter. Grimes continued to recur in the role throughout the years following her character's death, usually in dreams or as a hallucination to the mentally ill. Grimes' final return as Cassie's ghost was over the course of July 8, 2013 to October 30, 2014, during which the actress would return to The Young and the Restless as a main cast member, as Cassie's previously unknown twin sister, Mariah Copeland. In January 2020, it was reported that Grimes would be reprising the role of Cassie, appearing on February 7th. Both the actress and character were well-received by fans and enjoyed critical acclaim, with Grimes becoming the youngest recipient of the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2000, at age 10. Character development  When she debuted, Cassie was 6 years old, having been born on January 8, 1991. She was adopted by Alice Johnson (Tamara Clatterbuck) as an infant. However, in 1994, Alice disappeared and left her in the care of her elderly mother Millie. Sharon's best friend Grace Turner (Jennifer Gareis) later tracked down Cassie and took her for herself. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that Grace wanted Cassie as a \\"pet\\" despite knowing Sharon was her biological mother. As she grew up, she went from a sweet child to a \\"rebellious\\" teen who began to lie to her parents. She also wanted to hang out with older kids at school, like Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei) and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). She was grounded because of her \\"rebellious streak\\". Cassie was described as a \\"good girl\\" who wanted to \\"fit in\\" but began cutting classes, giving her parents attitude and \\"a whole host of other angsty teenage pleasantries.\\" Cassie died following a car crash on the episode that aired May 24, 2005. Grimes said that she has missed the show since leaving, and was shocked to find out that Cassie was killed off. She stated: \\"If it's meant to happen, it's meant to happen. Everything happens for a reason, I think.\\" Of Cassie's last scene, she said it was \\"ridiculously hard [...] If you watch my death scene, where Sharon is crying over me - I'm supposed to be dead - but I'm crying.\\" If Cassie wasn't killed off, Grimes wanted her to have a love interest, stating: \\"I always wanted a love interest. If I'd stayed on the show, I had hoped that was where it would go eventually. Liberty Kontranowski of About.com labeled Cassie's death as one of the \\"saddest and hardest-hitting storylines\\" of daytime. After her death, her parents began 'Cassie's Foundation', a movement \\"to prevent teenage drinking and driving.\\" Storylines Cassie was born in 1991, when her then sixteen- year-old mother Sharon Collins (Sharon Case) was pressured to sleep with her high school boyfriend, Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), which she did. Sharon gave the child up for adoption, as she and her mother were financially struggling, and Frank wanted nothing to do with the child. Three years later, in 1994, Sharon moves to Genoa City, where she meets and eventually marries Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), son of wealthy business tycoon Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). In 1997, Sharon and Nick's newborn son, Noah Newman (Robert Adamson) becomes ill and it is believed that he may die. As a result, Sharon's best friend Grace Turner (Josie Davis, replaced mid-storyline by Jennifer Gareis) tracks down the baby Sharon gave up for adoption, Cassie, who had been adopted by a woman named Alice Johnson (Tamara Clatterbuck). However, Alice abandoned Cassie, and her frail, elderly mother Millie ended up caring for her. Millie reluctantly allows Grace to bring Cassie to Genoa City. When Noah survives, Grace decides to keep Cassie, wanting to raise the six-year-old with her boyfriend Tony Viscardi (Nick Scotti). Sharon meets Cassie, unaware that she is her daughter. A year later, Sharon learns the truth about Cassie being her daughter. In the process, Grace attempted to run away with Cassie, but her plans are foiled. Cassie is soon adopted by Sharon and Nick. At age eleven, Cassie almost drowns in a frozen pond. In 2003, Frank Barritt shows up in town, surprising Sharon and Cassie at Fenmore's Boutique, without divulging to Cassie who he is. Cassie and Frank share another encounter at Crimson Lights. Frank, having read about her near-death in the pond, wants to form a relationship with his daughter. Nick warns Frank to stay away, and Sharon simply tells Cassie that Frank is someone from her past. Later, Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby) murders Frank and frames Sharon. At the time of his death, Frank had plans to look into his parental rights with Cassie. Nick and Sharon tell Cassie that Frank was her father, and the prospect of never knowing her biological father devastates her. In 2005, Cassie turns fourteen and yearns to be a part of the \\"popular kids\\" clique at school. She develops a crush on Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is two years older than her, and socializes with the older teens: Daniel, Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), Colleen Carlton (Lyndsy Fonseca), Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), and Sierra Hoffman (Asia Ray Smith). The five of them laugh behind Cassie's back at her attempts to act mature around them. Cassie begins rebelling, skipping classes and being rude to her parents. One night, Cassie attends a party, despite telling her parents that she was going to see a movie. At the party, she finds a drunken Daniel passed out, and decides to drive him home to the Newman ranch, where he lives with his mother Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford). Cassie, who is under-age and without a license, crashes the car, injuring herself significantly, and Daniel to a lesser extent. Daniel and Cassie are both rushed to the hospital with no memories of the crash, and it is believed that Daniel drove while intoxicated. A severely injured Cassie remembers that she was driving, and staggers out of the hospital to find Daniel and tell him. Nick finds her at Crimson Lights where she collapses, and dies hours later at the hospital with Nick and Sharon by her side; she manages to tell Nick part of the truth, and promises her parents that they will have another daughter. Nine months after Cassie‚Äôs death, with Sharon spending more and more time with work and Brad Carlton, Nick cheats on Sharon with Phyllis, resulting in the birth of a daughter, Summer Newman (Hunter King), which ends his marriage to Sharon. After her death, Cassie appears on multiple occasions to both Nick and Sharon as a spirit or in a dream. In 2009, she visits Sharon in a dream, while she is pregnant with Nick's child. Sharon gives birth to a daughter, Faith Newman (Alyvia Alyn Lind), who is stolen at birth by Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), and it is believed for six months that she was stillborn. Nick and Sharon are reunited with Faith in 2010. Before this, Cassie visits Sharon and assures her that she will be reunited with her daughter. In 2013, Cassie made various appearances as an apparition to Sharon while she was off her bipolar disorder meds, and had altered DNA test results between Nick and Summer in order to get closer to Nick. Cassie continued appearing in dreams and visions to Sharon throughout 2014.  Reception  She was awarded the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2000 for her portrayal of Cassie, becoming the youngest winner to receive the award, at age 10, beating Kimberly McCullough, who won at age 11. Grimes was credited in 2009 as the medium's most talented younger actresses right up until the end, and her character's death is named #41 in the list of The 100 Most Memorable Moments in Soap History, both recognitions by Soaps Hunks. After Cassie was killed off, fans were upset. According to Akron Beacon Journal, some fans were \\"depressed\\" and angry that Cassie was killed off. They also hoped that she could possibly be \\"brought back to life\\" like the character of Taylor Forrester (Hunter Tylo) on the show's sister-soap, The Bold and the Beautiful. Liberty Kontranowski of About.com praised the character, stating \\"Cassie was a great character, brilliantly played by the Emmy-winning Camryn Grimes. It was devastating to see her go, but it was a story that will continue to impact the members of Genoa City for years to come.\\" References External links *Cassidy \\"Cassie\\" Newman @ soapcentral.com Category:The Young and the Restless characters Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional identical twins Category:Fictional socialites Category:Television characters introduced in 1997 Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Cassie Newman"},{"id":"8039960","text":"Emission-aware programming is a design philosophy aiming to reduce the amount of electromagnetic radiation emitted by electronic devices through proper design of the software executed by the device, rather than changing the hardware. Emission sources Emission considerations require the evaluation of many details such as the clock frequencies and switching rates which are related to the oscillator. Rise/fall times and signal harmonics are related to the output driver. The data transfer rates can be dependent on hardware or can be controlled by software and often have to meet a certain protocol. Impedances, trace loading and the various circuit components are hardware related and must be considered from the beginning of the design. Three basic actions for emission reduction can be defined: * Avoidance of unnecessary RF noise. : Only this action can be applied to software-based emission control. Reduction of, for instance, the switching frequency or the number of switching circuits reduces the power consumption and therefore the emissions. For example this could be low voltage operation or the usage of power reduction modes. * Keeping RF energy insulated from antenna structures. : RF energy is not a problem if the structures dealing with it are too small for acting as effective antennas. A decoupling capacitor keeps most of the RF energy locally in a small loop between the device and the capacitor as shown in the figure. Insulation of RF energy by correct placement of a decoupling capacitor. * Transforming RF energy into heat. : Any impedance formed by coils, capacitors, resistors, ferrites etc. can be used for this purpose. In the following all components that can be influenced by the software design will be described. =Oscillator= Microcontrollers require a clock source for the switching of the internal transistors. Almost all controllers require an external crystal or ceramic resonator. Since the ceramic resonator is potentially sensitive to spikes which can shorten clock periods typically a Pierce oscillator configuration is used. Harmonic frequencies of the clock cause unwanted emissions. The circuit internal to the MC in simplified form is a NAND gate followed by an inverter. The external oscillator is not the only source of emissions. The system clock circuits consists of an internal RF divider followed by large amplifiers. These amplifiers drive long lines inside the components and might cause interferences. The use of internal oscillators instead of external ones should be preferred. (An additional hardware measure is the use of spread spectrum oscillators.) =Power supply= The field strength is proportional to the current as a consequence the power supply, providing the current for the entire system, is a strong source of emissions. Physically, a reduction of the power consumption of the system and the minimising of circuit loops (by the usage of decoupling capacities) emitting the noise, improves the EME performance. A software based solution is to temporary disable peripheral devices when not needed and thereby reduce unnecessary power consumption. =I/O pins= If an MC uses external memory space or peripheral devices continuous transitions on several data/address bus lines are implied. The emission depends on the frequency of the transitions, their quantity, rise/fall time and duration. The quantity of transitions, of port traffic can be influenced by the use of interrupts instead of continuous polling of ports. The use of interrupts is software based as well. For the IRQ or reset pins (input pins) the termination is more important than for general I/O ports. If noise causes these two pins to mis-trigger it will have a negative effect on the circuit behavior. A high current consumption is often observed, particularly in CMOS devices, when the input pins are unconnected due to leakage current internal to the IC. Terminating high impedance input pins can therefore lead to a reduction in supply current and hence reduces emission. With most MC the internal pull-up resistors can be used to set unused pins to a defined voltage level. =Ringing= To achieve fastest possible transmission rates the fastest possible switching rates are applied. The faster the switching rate the more likely over- and undershooting (ringing) will occur. Ringing of the output signal is mainly caused by parasitic elements of the output structure e.g. the capacitive components like the parasitic capacities and the load capacitances as well as the parasitic inductances that are built by the bond wire and the lead frame. In four techniques to reduce ringing are described: * Digital control * Increasing the on-resistance * Feedback control * Skewing of the output driver switching =Ground bounce= Ground bounce is a voltage bounce caused by simultaneous switching of several outputs from one logic state to the other, for example from high to low. The voltage built up across the parasitic inductance of the IC ground return connection causes a transient voltage potential shift in the ground reference potential with respect to the system ground. Ground bounce is caused by CMOS crowbar current and the dynamic switching currents of capacitive loads. Rise and fall time One way of reducing the emissions of an MC System is to extend the rise and fall time (slew rate control). Some controllers like the Motorola HCS08 offer the feature of software controlled slew rate output buffers enabling the user to extend the rise time from 3 ns to 30 ns for each pin separately. Some microcontrollers offer current limiting, a way of limiting the maximum current driven by the output port (e.g. Motorola MCS12). Emission control: power saving The most effective way of reducing emissions is to temporary shut down unused modules in the MC, thereby saving power. Most controller support several sleep modes. Conclusion In order to reduce electromagnetic emissions on software basis the following measures should be considered: * Oscillator (kind and frequency) * Power (Saving modes, low voltage operation and supply) * I/O port switching frequency and power (if possible: slew rate control and skewing) Most software implemented improvements on emission can only be detected using an average- detector.

The name is not in use for any modern administrative entity, but remains as the usual description for historical purposes, in the case of the registration district being only a name change. The name \\"Abernethy\\" is derived from the local River Nethy (\\"aber\\" is Pictish for a river mouth or junction). The name Kincardine is of mixed Gaelic and Pictish origin, \\"ceann\\" being Scots Gaelic for head and \\"cardden\\" the Brythonic/Pictish for a wooded area; the latter element also features as \\"garten\\" in other nearby placenames. The current main village, Bridge of Nethy, now more well known as Nethy Bridge was located around the confluence of the River Nethy and the Duack Burn, at ; its earlier growth was mostly upriver along the banks of the Nethy. The Ecclesiastical Parish The Church of Scotland parish was created in the 16th century by the combination of the parishes of Kincardine and Abernethy, both of which have ancient origins and past or later associations with other churches. Both parish churches (and associated burial grounds) remain in use. The baptism registers (up to 1856, since deposited with the Registrar General with microfilm copies at a number of places) have poor coverage around the 1820s, apart from those events not recorded if the parishioners were members of other churches. The pre-1855 marriage registers are in a similar condition but also contain some \\"extra\\" entries concerning parishioners who married in other parishes or denominations, including some Roman Catholic marriages (indicated as \\"married by a priest\\"). Changes in modern church-going habits have led to Church of Scotland ministers usually covering more than one of the original parishes, in this case resulting in the once \\"United Parish\\" of Abernethy and Kincardine becoming separated again and the parts joined to neighbouring parishes; the 2006 circuits for the area are now advertisedStrathspey and Badenoch Herald, 15 Nov 2006. as \\"Abernethy, Cromdale and Advie\\" and \\"Boat of Garten and Kincardine with Duthil Carrbridge\\". =Abernethy Kirk= This churchAbernethy Kirk.

The Civil Parish and Registration District The civil parish (based on the boundary of the ecclesiastical parish) originally straddled parts of Inverness-shire and Morayshire; county boundary changes in the latter half of the 19th century resulted in the entire parish being contained within Inverness-shire. The parish council has since been abolished. It remained as a registration district (since 1972 renamed as Nethybridge) until 2001, generally matching the 19th century census district; from 2002 it became part of the Grantown on Spey and Nethybridge registration district. General Register Office - List of Parishes and Registration Districts Due to a combination of registration district boundaries not being tied to local authority boundaries and later changes of the county boundary, events will be found described as happening in Invernessshire or (until 1862) Morayshire but (barring any confusion with the Perthshire town of Abernethy) the same address within this parish is usually being referred to if only the county varies.

The margravial title was given to princes of the Prussian Royal House and did not express a territorial status. He is best known as the recipient of Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg concertos.Malcolm Boyd. Bach: the Brandenburg Concertos. Cambridge University Press, 1993.  Biography  Born in Berlin, Christian Ludwig was the youngest son of the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William (1620‚Äì1688), ruler of Brandenburg-Prussia, and his second wife Princess Sophia Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg (1636‚Äì1689). Like his elder brothers, he inherited large estates around Schwedt, Vierraden and Wildenbruch his mother had acquired to provide for her sons, while according to the Hohenzollern primogeniture principle the rule over Brandenburg-Prussia passed to Frederick-William's first-born son, Crown Prince Frederick III, who became King in Prussia in 1701. Even in Brandenburg- Schwedt, however, he had to accept the prerogative of his eldest brother Margrave Philip William. Moreover, sober times began in 1713 with the accession of King Frederick William I, known as the \\"Soldier King\\", who enlisted large financial resources to build up the Prussian Army. Nevertheless, Christian Ludwig, interested in the musical works of Georg Frideric Handel, was able to maintain a court orchestra at the Berlin City Palace. He also was vested with the manors of Malchow and Heinersdorf, earning him a regular income and an officer commission. From 1695 Margrave Christian Ludwig served as a general lieutenant at the Stettin garrison and commander of the Old Prussian Infantry Regiment No.7. He also acted as administrator of the secularised Prussian Principality of Halberstadt and was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle for his merits. When Johann Sebastian Bach was sent to Berlin by Prince Leopold of Anhalt-K√∂then in 1719, the composer met with the music- loving margrave. Bach appreciated Christian Ludwig's interest in his compositions and two years later dedicated his Six Concerts Avec plusieurs Instruments (BWV 1046‚Äì1051) to him. Margrave Christian Ludwig died without heirs in Malchow. He is buried in the Hohenzollern crypt of Berlin Cathedral.

In architecture, a vault (French vo√ªte, from Italian volta) is a self-supporting arched form, usually of stone or brick, serving to cover a space with a ceiling or roof. The simplest kind of vault is the barrel vault (also called a wagon or tunnel vault), which is generally semicircular in shape. The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of voussoirs are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the keystone, is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by centering consisting of a framed truss with a semicircular or segmental head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings. The parts of a vault exert lateral thrust that requires a counter resistance. When vaults are built underground, the ground gives all the resistance required. However, when the vault is built above ground, various replacements are employed to supply the needed resistance. An example is the thicker walls used in the case of barrel or continuous vaults. Buttresses are used to supply resistance when intersecting vaults are employed. Vault types =Dome= Assyrian bas- relief from Nimrud showing domed structures in the background. Amongst the earliest known examples of any form of vaulting is to be found in the neolithic village of Khirokitia on Cyprus. Dating from BCE, the circular buildings supported beehive shaped corbel domed vaults of unfired mud-bricks and also represent the first evidence for settlements with an upper floor. Similar beehive tombs, called tholoi, exist in Crete and Northern Iraq. Their construction differs from that at Khirokitia in that most appear partially buried and make provision for a dromos entry. The inclusion of domes, however, represents a wider sense of the word vault. The distinction between the two is that a vault is essentially an arch which is extruded into the third dimension, whereas a dome is an arch revolved around its vertical axis. =Pitched brick barrel vault= In a pitched-brick vault the bricks lean (are pitched) against an existing wall. Pitched-brick vaults are named for their construction, the bricks are installed vertically (not radially) and are leaning (pitched) at an angle: This allows their construction to be completed without the use of centering. Examples have been found in archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia dating to the 2nd and 3rd millennium BCE,Lynne C. Lancaster, \\"Early Examples of So-Called Pitched Brick Barrel Vaulting in Roman Greece and Asia Minor: A Question of Origin and Intention\\" which were set in gypsum mortar. =Barrel vault= St Paul's Cathedral Choir looking east, London Pointed barrel vault showing direction of lateral forces. A barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault and resembles a barrel or tunnel cut lengthwise in half. The effect is that of a structure composed of continuous semicircular or pointed sections. The earliest known examples of barrel vaults were built by the Sumerians, possibly under the ziggurat at Nippur in Babylonia,Spiers (1911) states that the vaults under the ziggurat were 4000 BCE; more recent scholarship revises the date forward considerably but imprecisely, and casts doubt on the methodology and conclusions of the original excavations of 1880. See which was built of fired bricks cemented with clay mortar. The earliest barrel vaults in ancient Egypt are thought to be those in the granaries built by the 19th dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses II, the ruins of which are behind the Ramesseum, at Thebes.Willockx, Sjef (2003) Building in stone in Ancient Egypt, Part 1: Columns and PillarsPhotograph of the barrel vaults at the RamesseumArchitectural elements used by ancient Egyptian builders The span was and the lower part of the arch was built in horizontal courses, up to about one-third of the height, and the rings above were inclined back at a slight angle, so that the bricks of each ring, laid flatwise, adhered till the ring was completed, no centering of any kind being required; the vault thus formed was elliptic in section, arising from the method of its construction. A similar system of construction was employed for the vault over the great hall at Ctesiphon, where the material employed was fired bricks or tiles of great dimensions, cemented with mortar; but the span was close upon , and the thickness of the vault was nearly at the top, there being four rings of brickwork. Assyrian palaces used pitched-brick vaults, made with sun-dried mudbricks, for gates, subterranean graves and drains. During the reign of king Sennacherib they were used to construct aqueducts, such as those at Jerwan. In the provincial city D≈´r-Katlimmu they were used to created vaulted platforms. The tradition of their erection, however, would seem to have been handed down to their successors in Mesopotamia, viz. to the Sassanians, who in their palaces in Sarvestan and Firouzabad built domes of similar form to those shown in the Nimrud sculptures, the chief difference being that, constructed in rubble stone and cemented with mortar, they still exist, though probably abandoned on the Islamic invasion in the 7th century. In all the instances above quoted in Sumer and Egypt the bricks, whether burnt or sun-dried, were of the description to which the term \\"tile\\" would now be given; the dimensions varied from to being generally square and about to thick, and they were not shaped as voussoirs, the connecting medium being thicker at the top than at the bottom. The earliest Egyptian examples of regular voussoirs in stone belong to the XXVIth Dynasty () in the additions made then to the temple of Medinet Habu, and here it is probable that centering of some kind was provided, as the vaults are built in rings, so that the same centering could be shifted on after the completion of each ring. The earliest example of regularly shaped voussoirs, and of about the same date, is found in the cloaca at Graviscae in Etruria, with a span of about , the voussoirs of which are from 5 to long. The cloaca maxima in Rome, built by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus (603 BCE) to drain the marshy ground between the Palatine and the Capitoline Hills, was according to Commendatore Boni vaulted over in the 1st century BCE, the vault being over long, in span, with three concentric rings of voussoirs. The enormous Eyvan-e Khosro at Ctesiphon (near present-day Baghdad) was built over 1,500 years ago during the Persian Sasanian period as a throne room. The arch is about high, across and long, built entirely without centering and it was the largest vault constructed until modern times.Iran, Seven Faces of Civilization ‚Äì youtube.com =Groin vaults= A groin vault viewed from the underside, showing the arris or 'groin'. So far, all the vaults mentioned have been barrel vaults, which, when not built underground, required continuous walls of great thickness to resist their thrust; the earliest example of the next variety, the intersecting barrel vault, is said to be over a small hall at Pergamum, in Asia Minor, but its first employment over halls of great dimensions is due to the Romans. When two semicircular barrel vaults of the same diameter cross one another their intersection (a true ellipse) is known as a groin vault, down which the thrust of the vault is carried to the cross walls; if a series of two or more barrel vaults intersect one another, the weight is carried on to the piers at their intersection and the thrust is transmitted to the outer cross walls; thus in the Roman reservoir at Baiae, known as the Piscina Mirabilis, a series of five aisles with semicircular barrel vaults are intersected by twelve cross aisles, the vaults being carried on 48 piers and thick external walls. The width of these aisles being only about there was no great difficulty in the construction of these vaults, but in the Roman Baths of Caracalla the tepidarium had a span of , more than twice that of an English cathedral, so that its construction both from the statical and economical point of view was of the greatest importance.Artlex Art Dictionary The researches of M. Choisy (L'Art de b√¢tir chez les Romains), based on a minute examination of those portions of the vaults which still remain in situ, have shown that, on a comparatively slight centering, consisting of trusses placed about apart and covered with planks laid from truss to truss, were laid ‚Äì to begin with ‚Äì two layers of the Roman brick (measuring nearly square and 2 in. thick); on these and on the trusses transverse rings of brick were built with longitudinal ties at intervals; on the brick layers and embedding the rings and cross ties concrete was thrown in horizontal layers, the haunches being filled in solid, and the surface sloped on either side and covered over with a tile roof of low pitch laid direct on the concrete. The rings relieved the centering from the weight imposed, and the two layers of bricks carried the concrete till it had set. Plan of a groin vault from above showing resultant outward thrust. Groin vault from above. As the walls carrying these vaults were also built in concrete with occasional bond courses of brick, the whole structure was homogeneous. One of the important ingredients of the mortar was a volcanic deposit found near Rome, known as pozzolana, which, when the concrete had set, not only made the concrete as solid as the rock itself, but to a certain extent neutralized the thrust of the vaults, which formed shells equivalent to that of a metal lid; the Romans, however, do not seem to have recognized the value of this pozzolana mixture, for they otherwise provided amply for the counteracting of any thrust which might exist by the erection of cross walls and buttresses. In the tepidaria of the Thermae and in the basilica of Constantine, in order to bring the thrust well within the walls, the main barrel vault of the hall was brought forward on each side and rested on detached columns, which constituted the principal architectural decoration. In cases where the cross vaults intersecting were not of the same span as those of the main vault, the arches were either stilted so that their soffits might be of the same height, or they formed smaller intersections in the lower part of the vault; in both of these cases, however, the intersections or groins were twisted, for which it was very difficult to form a centering, and, moreover, they were of disagreeable effect: though every attempt was made to mask this in the decoration of the vault by panels and reliefs modelled in stucco. The widest hall vaulted by the Romans was that of the throne room in the palace of Diocletian on the Palatine Hill, and this had the enormous span of , its thrust being counteracted by other halls on either side with buttresses outside. In provincial towns and in other parts of the Roman Empire, where the material pozzolana was not procurable, the Romans had to trust to their mortar as a cementing medium, but this, though excellent of its kind, was not of sufficient cohesive strength to allow of the erection of vaults of more than about span, which were generally built in rubble masonry. There still exist in Asia Minor and Syria some vaulted halls, generally attached to thermae, which are carried on walls of great thickness. There were many varieties of the Roman vault, whether continuous or intersected, such as those employed over the corridors on the Colosseum and the theatre of Marcellus, but in these cases the springing of the vault was above the summit of the arches of the main front, so that there was no intersection; on the other hand, over the corridors were either elliptical or semicircular, or over the staircases rising vaults, all of which were more difficult to construct; there were also numerous solutions of vault over circular halls, of which that of the Pantheon is the most important example, having a diameter of , and over the hemicycles, which were sometimes of great size; that known as Canopus in Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli had a diameter of , and was vaulted over with a series of ribs, between which were alternating rampant flat and semicircular webs and cells; in the same villa and in Rome were octagonal halls with various other combinations of vault. Another type of vault not yet referred to is that of the Tabularium arcade where the Cloister vault was employed. Fig. 3 compared with fig. 2 will show the difference; in the former the angles of intersection are inset, and in the latter they are groins with projecting angles at the base, which die away at the summit. =Rib vault= The rib vault of Reims Cathedral, France. Reference has been made to the rib vault in Roman work, where the intersecting barrel vaults were not of the same diameter. Their construction must at all times have been somewhat difficult, but where the barrel vaulting was carried round over the choir aisle and was intersected (as in St Bartholomew-the-Great in Smithfield, London) by semicones instead of cylinders, it became worse and the groins more complicated. This would seem to have led to a change of system and to the introduction of a new feature, which completely revolutionized the construction of the vault. Hitherto the intersecting features were geometrical surfaces, of which the diagonal groins were the intersections, elliptical in form, generally weak in construction and often twisting. The medieval builder reversed the process, and set up the diagonal ribs first, which were utilized as permanent centres, and on these he carried his vault or web, which henceforward took its shape from the ribs. Instead of the elliptical curve which was given by the intersection of two semicircular barrel vaults, or cylinders, he employed the semicircular arch for the diagonal ribs; this, however, raised the centre of the square bay vaulted above the level of the transverse arches and of the wall ribs, and thus gave the appearance of a dome to the vault, such as may be seen in the nave of Sant'Ambrogio, Florence. To meet this, at first the transverse and wall ribs were stilted, or the upper part of their arches was raised, as in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes at Caen, and the Abbey of Lessay, in Normandy. The problem was ultimately solved by the introduction of the pointed arch for the transverse and wall ribs ‚Äì the pointed arch had long been known and employed, on account of its much greater strength and of the less thrust it exerted on the walls. When employed for the ribs of a vault, however narrow the span might be, by adopting a pointed arch, its summit could be made to range in height with the diagonal rib; and, moreover, when utilized for the ribs of the annular vault, as in the aisle round the apsidal termination of the choir, it was not necessary that the half ribs on the outer side should be in the same plane as those of the inner side; for when the opposite ribs met in the centre of the annular vault, the thrust was equally transmitted from one to the other, and being already a broken arch the change of its direction was not noticeable. Rib vault of church Sint- Niklaaskerk in Ghent, Belgium. Top of the rib-vaulted ceiling over the nave of Salisbury Cathedral. The first introduction of the pointed arch rib took place at Cefal√π Cathedral and pre-dated the abbey of Saint-Denis. Whilst the pointed rib-arch is often seen as an identifier for Gothic architecture, Cefal√π is a Romanesque cathedral whose masons experimented with the possibility of Gothic rib-arches before it was widely adopted by western church architecture.Basic architectural history course Besides Cefal√π Cathedral, theintroduction of the pointed arch rib would seem to have taken place in the choir aisles of the abbey of Saint-Denis, near Paris, built by the abbot Suger in 1135. It was in the church at Vezelay (1140) that it was extended to the square bay of the porch. Before entering into the question of the web or stone shell of the vault carried on the ribs, the earlier development of the great vaults which were thrown over the naves of a cathedral, or church, before the introduction of the pointed arch rib, shall here be noted. As has been pointed out, the aisles had already in the early Christian churches been covered over with groined vaults, the only advance made in the later developments being the introduction of transverse ribs' dividing the bays into square compartments; but when in the 12th centuryTransverse ribs under the vaulting surfaces had been employed from very early times by the Romans, and utilized as permanent stone centerings for their vaults; perhaps the earliest examples are those in the corridor of the Tabularium in Rome, which is divided into square bays, each vaulted with a cloister dome. Transverse ribs are also found in the Roman Piscinae and in the Nymphaeum at Nimes; they were not introduced by the Romanesque masons till the 11th century. the first attempts were made to vault over the naves, another difficulty presented itself, because the latter were twice the width of the aisles, so that it became necessary to include two bays of the aisles to form one square bay in the nave. This was an immense space to vault over, and moreover, it followed that every alternate pier served no purpose, so far as the support of the nave vault was concerned, and this would seem to have suggested an alternative, viz. to provide a supplementary rib across the church and between the transverse ribs. This resulted in what is known as a sexpartite, or six-celled vault, of which one of the earliest examples is found in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes (S. Etienne) at Caen. This church, built by William the Conqueror, was originally constructed to carry a timber roof only, but nearly a century later the upper part of the nave walls were partly rebuilt, in order that it might be covered with a vault. The immense size, however, of the square vault over the nave necessitated some additional support, so that an intermediate rib was thrown across the church, dividing the square compartment into six cells, and called the sexpartite vault this was adopted in the cathedrals of Sens (1170), Laon (1195), Noyon (1190), Paris (1223‚Äì1235), and Bourges (1250). The intermediate rib, however, had the disadvantage of partially obscuring one side of the clerestory windows, and it threw unequal weights on the alternate piers, so that in the cathedral of Soissons (1205) a quadripartite or four-celled vault was introduced, the width of each bay being half the span of the nave, and corresponding therefore with the aisle piers. To this there are some exceptions, in Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, and San Michele, Pavia (the original vault), and in the cathedrals of Speyer, Mainz and Worms, where the quadripartite vaults are nearly square, the intermediate piers of the aisles being of much smaller dimensions. In England sexpartite vaults exist at Canterbury (1175) (set out by William of Sens), Rochester (1200), Lincoln (1215), Durham (east transept), and St. Faith's chapel, Westminster Abbey. In the earlier stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs consisted of independent or separate voussoirs down to the springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) the lower part of the transverse diagonal and wall ribs were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from one side to the other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. cerce) being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in clerestories, the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term ploughshare vaulting is given. Lierne ribs, of the Liebfrauenkirche, M√ºhlacker 1482. One of the earliest examples of the introduction of the intermediate rib is found in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, and there the ridge rib is not carried to the wall rib. It was soon found, however, that the construction of the web was much facilitated by additional ribs, and consequently there was a tendency to increase their number, so that in the nave of Exeter Cathedral three intermediate ribs were provided between the wall rib and the diagonal rib. In order to mask the junction of the various ribs, their intersections were ornamented with richly carved bosses, and this practice increased on the introduction of another short rib, known as the lierne, a term in France given to the ridge rib. Lierne ribs are short ribs crossing between the main ribs, and were employed chiefly as decorative features, as, for instance, in the Liebfrauenkirche (1482) of M√ºhlacker, Germany. One of the best examples of Lierne ribs exists in the vault of the oriel window of Crosby Hall, London. The tendency to increase the number of ribs led to singular results in some cases, as in the choir of Gloucester Cathedral, where the ordinary diagonal ribs become mere ornamental mouldings on the surface of an intersected pointed barrel vault, and again in the cloisters, where the introduction of the fan vault, forming a concave-sided conoid, returned to the principles of the Roman geometrical vault. This is further shown in the construction of these fan vaults, for although in the earliest examples each of the ribs above the tas-de-charge was an independent feature, eventually it was found easier to carve them and the web out of the solid stone, so that the rib and web were purely decorative and had no constructional or independent functions. =Fan vault= Fan vaulting over the nave at Bath Abbey, Bath, England The fan vault would seem to have owed its origin to the employment of centerings of one curve for all the ribs, instead of having separate centerings for the transverse, diagonal wall and intermediate ribs; it was facilitated also by the introduction of the four- centred arch, because the lower portion of the arch formed part of the fan, or conoid, and the upper part could be extended at pleasure with a greater radius across the vault. The simplest version is that found in the cloisters of Gloucester Cathedral, where the fans meet one another at the summit, so that there are only small compartments between the fans to be filled up. In later examples, as in King's College Chapel, Cambridge, on account of the great dimensions of the vault, it was found necessary to introduce transverse ribs, which were required to give greater strength. Similar transverse ribs are found in Henry VII's chapel and in the Divinity School at Oxford, where a new development presented itself. One of the defects of the fan vault at Gloucester is the appearance it gives of being half sunk in the wall; to remedy this, in the two buildings just quoted, the complete conoid is detached and treated as a pendant. Byzantine vaults and domes Section through the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. The vault of the Basilica of Maxentius, completed by Constantine, was the last great work carried out in Rome before its fall, and two centuries pass before the next important development is found in the Church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) at Constantinople. It is probable that the realization of the great advance in the science of vaulting shown in this church owed something to the eastern tradition of dome vaulting seen in the Assyrian domes, which are known to us only by the representations in the bas-relief from Nimrud, because in the great water cisterns in Istanbul, known as the Basilica Cistern and Bin bir direk (cistern with a thousand and one columns), we find the intersecting groin vaults of the Romans already replaced by small cupolas or domes. These domes, however, are of small dimensions when compared with that projected and carried out by Justinian in the Hagia Sophia. Previous to this the greatest dome was that of the Pantheon at Rome, but this was carried on an immense wall thick, and with the exception of small niches or recesses in the thickness of the wall could not be extended, so that Justinian apparently instructed his architect to provide an immense hemicycle or apse at the eastern end, a similar apse at the western end, and great arches on either side, the walls under which would be pierced with windows. Unlike the Pantheon dome, the upper portions of which are made of concrete, Byzantine domes were made of brick, which were lighter and thinner, but more vulnerable to the forces exerted onto them. Neo-Byzantine vaults in portal of the Basilique du Sacr√©-C≈ìur, Paris, France. The diagram shows the outlines of the solution of the problem. If a hemispherical dome is cut by four vertical planes, the intersection gives four semicircular arches; if cut in addition by a horizontal plane tangent to the top of these arches, it describes a circle; that portion of the sphere which is below this circle and between the arches, forming a spherical spandril, is the pendentive, and its radius is equal to the diagonal of the square on which the four arches rest. Having obtained a circle for the base of the dome, it is not necessary that the upper portion of the dome should spring from the same level as the arches, or that its domical surface should be a continuation of that of the pendentive. The first and second dome of the Hagia Sophia apparently fell down, so that Justinian determined to raise it, possibly to give greater lightness to the structure, but mainly in order to obtain increased light for the interior of the church. This was effected by piercing it with forty windows ‚Äì the effect of which, as the light streaming through these windows, gave the dome the appearance of being suspended in the air. The pendentive which carried the dome rested on four great arches, the thrust of those crossing the church being counteracted by immense buttresses which traversed the aisles, and the other two partly by smaller arches in the apse, the thrust being carried to the outer walls, and to a certain extent by the side walls which were built under the arches. From the description given by Procopius we gather that the centering employed for the great arches consisted of a wall erected to support them during their erection. The construction of the pendentives is not known, but it is surmised that to the top of the pendentives they were built in horizontal courses of brick, projecting one over the other, the projecting angles being cut off afterwards and covered with stucco in which the mosaics were embedded; this was the method employed in the erection of the P√©rigordian domes, to which we shall return; these, however, were of less diameter than those of the Hagia Sophia, being only about 40 to instead of The apotheosis of Byzantine architecture, in fact, was reached in Hagia Sophia, for although it formed the model on which all subsequent Byzantine churches were based, so far as their plan was concerned, no domes approaching the former in dimensions were even attempted. The principal difference in some later examples is that which took place in the form of the pendentive on which the dome was carried. Instead of the spherical spandril of Hagia Sophia, large niches were formed in the angles, as in the Mosque of Damascus, which was built by Byzantine workmen for the Al-Walid I in CE 705; these gave an octagonal base on which the hemispherical dome rested; or again, as in the Sassanian palaces of Sarvestan and Firouzabad of the 4th and 5th century, when a series of concentric arch rings, projecting one in front of the other, were built, giving also an octagonal base; each of these pendentives is known as a squinch. Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus. There is one other remarkable vault, also built by Justinian, in the Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople. The central area of this church was octagonal on plan, and the dome is divided into sixteen compartments; of these eight consist of broad flat bands rising from the centre of each of the walls, and the alternate eight are concave cells over the angles of the octagon, which externally and internally give to the roof the appearance of an umbrella. Romanesque Nave of Lisbon Cathedral with a barrel vaulted soffit. Note the absence of clerestory windows, all of the light being provided by the Rose window at one end of the vault. Although the dome constitutes the principal characteristic of the Byzantine church, throughout Asia Minor are numerous examples in which the naves are vaulted with the semicircular barrel vault, and this is the type of vault found throughout the south of France in the 11th and 12th centuries, the only change being the occasional substitution of the pointed barrel vault, adopted not only on account of its exerting a less thrust, but because, as pointed out by Fergusson (vol. ii. p. 46), the roofing tiles were laid directly on the vault and a less amount of filling in at the top was required. The continuous thrust of the barrel vault in these cases was met either by semicircular or pointed barrel vaults on the aisles, which had only half the span of the nave; of this there is an interesting example in the Chapel of Saint John in the Tower of London ‚Äì and sometimes by half-barrel vaults. The great thickness of the walls, however, required in such constructions would seem to have led to another solution of the problem of roofing over churches with incombustible material, viz. that which is found throughout P√©rigord and La Charente, where a series of domes carried on pendentives covered over the nave, the chief peculiarities of these domes being the fact that the arches carrying them form part of the pendentives, which are all built in horizontal courses. The intersecting and groined vault of the Romans was employed in the early Christian churches in Rome, but only over the aisles, which were comparatively of small span, but in these there was a tendency to raise the centres of these vaults, which became slightly domical; in all these cases centering was employed. Gothic Revival and the Renaissance One good example of the fan vault is that over the staircase leading to the hall of Christ Church, Oxford, where the complete conoid is displayed in its centre carried on a central column. This vault, not built until 1640, is an example of traditional workmanship, probably in Oxford transmitted in consequence of the late vaulting of the entrance gateways to the colleges. Fan vaulting is peculiar to England, the only example approaching it in France being the pendant of the Lady-chapel at Caudebec, in Normandy. In France, Germany, and Spain the multiplication of ribs in the 15th century led to decorative vaults of various kinds, but with some singular modifications. Thus, in Germany, recognizing that the rib was no longer a necessary constructive feature, they cut it off abruptly, leaving a stump only; in France, on the other hand, they gave still more importance to the rib, by making it of greater depth, piercing it with tracery and hanging pendants from it, and the web became a horizontal stone paving laid on the top of these decorated vertical webs. This is the characteristic of the great Renaissance work in France and Spain; but it soon gave way to Italian influence, when the construction of vaults reverted to the geometrical surfaces of the Romans, without, however, always that economy in centering to which they had attached so much importance, and more especially in small structures. In large vaults, where it constituted an important expense, the chief boast of some of the most eminent architects has been that centering was dispensed with, as in the case of the dome of the Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, built by Filippo Brunelleschi, and Ferguson cites as an example the great dome of the church at Mousta in Malta, erected in the first half of the 19th century, which was built entirely without centering of any kind. Vaulting and faux-vaulting in the Renaissance and after It is important to note that whereas Roman vaults, like that of the Pantheon, and Byzantine vaults, like that at Hagia Sophia, were not protected from above (i.e. the vault from the inside was the same that one saw from the outside), the European architects of the Middle Ages protected their vaults with wooden roofs. In other words, one will not see a Gothic vault from the outside. The reasons for this development are hypothetical, but the fact that the roofed basilica form preceded the era when vaults begin to be made is certainly to be taken into consideration. In other words, the traditional image of a roof took precedence over the vault. The separation between interior and exterior ‚Äì and between structure and image ‚Äì was to be developed very purposefully in the Renaissance and beyond, especially once the dome became reinstated in the Western tradition as a key element in church design. Michelangelo's dome for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, as redesigned between 1585 and 1590 by Giacomo della Porta, for example, consists of two domes of which, however, only the inner is structural. Baltasar Neumann, in his baroque churches, perfected light-weight plaster vaults supported by wooden frames.Maren Holst. Studien zu Balthasar Neumanns W√∂lbformen (Mittenwald: M√§ander, 1981). These vaults, which exerted no lateral pressures, were perfectly suited for elaborate ceiling frescoes. In St Paul's Cathedral in London there is a highly complex system of vaults and faux-vaults. The dome that one sees from the outside is not a vault, but a relatively light-weight wooden-framed structure resting on an invisible ‚Äì and for its age highly original ‚Äì catenary vault of brick, below which is another dome, (the dome that one sees from the inside), but of plaster supported by a wood frame. From the inside, one can easily assume that one is looking at the same vault that one sees from the outside. India Vaults and dome of the Gol Gumbaz There are two distinctive \\"other ribbed vaults\\" (called \\"Karbandi\\" in Persian) in India which form no part of the development of European vaults, but have some unusual features; one carries the central dome of the Jumma Musjid at Bijapur (A.D. 1559), and the other is Gol Gumbaz, the tomb of Muhammad Adil Shah II (1626‚Äì1660) in the same town. The vault of the latter was constructed over a hall square, to carry a hemispherical dome. The ribs, instead of being carried across the angles only, thus giving an octagonal base for the dome, are carried across to the further pier of the octagon and consequently intersect one another, reducing the central opening to in diameter, and, by the weight of the masonry they carry, serving as counterpoise to the thrust of the dome, which is set back so as to leave a passage about wide round the interior. The internal diameter of the dome is , its height and the ribs struck from four centres have their springing from the floor of the hall. The Jumma Musjid dome was of smaller dimensions, on a square of with a diameter of , and was carried on piers only instead of immensely thick walls as in the tomb; but any thrust which might exist was counteracted by its transmission across aisles to the outer wall. Islamic architecture The Muqarnas is a form of vaulting common in Islamic architecture. Modern vaults Saint Sava. The vaults, 37.7 m high and 24 m wide are designed as concrete boxes. They were prefabricated and lifted with chains to their supposed position =Hyperbolic paraboloids= The 20th century saw great advances in reinforced concrete design. The advent of shell construction and the better mathematical understanding of hyperbolic paraboloids allowed very thin, strong vaults to be constructed with previously unseen shapes. The vaults in the Church of Saint Sava are made of prefabricated concrete boxes. They were build on the ground and lifted to 40 m on chains. =Vegetal vault= When made by plants or trees, either artificially or grown on purpose by humans, structures of this type are called tree tunnels.

Only South Karnataka was Mysore State from 1947 to 1956. The Unification of Karnataka refers to the formation of the Indian state of Karnataka (then named Mysore State) in 1956 when several Indian states were created by redrawing borders based on linguistic demographics. Decades earlier, during British rule the demand for a state based on Kannada demographics had been made. Historical background Territories before unification During the period of British rule, areas that now comprise Karnataka were under as many as 20 different administrative units with the princely state of Mysore, Nizam's Hyderabad, the Bombay Presidency, the Madras Presidency and the territory of Kodagu being the most important ones. In effect, nearly two-thirds of what is now Karnataka fell outside the rule of the Wodeyar kings of Mysore. This meant that the Kannadigas in these regions, in spite of their large numbers, did not have an administrative patronage. Kannadigas in the Hubli-Karnataka region for example, came under the rule of the Bombay Presidency where Marathi was the official language. Those in the Hyderabad-Karnataka region came under the Nizam's rule where Urdu was the main language. Kannadigas in South Canara came under the rule from the Madras Presidency which used Tamil as their main language. Under these conditions, a feeling of discontent began among Kannadigas outside Mysore. Thus, while the Kannadigas under the Nizam felt that Urdu was being forced on them at the expense of Kannada, those in the Bombay Presidency felt similarly concerning Marathi. These areas also remained economically undeveloped. It was in these conditions that the movement that first started as a protest against linguistic oppression, began demanding the creation of a separate state consolidating all Kannada-speaking regions. This was called the Ekikarana or 'Unification' movement. Role of North Karnataka Almost the entire southern half of Karnataka was then under the Wodeyars of Mysore with Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar. The official language of the state was Kannada and the state was also one of the more progressive states of the day. Important protagonists of the Ekikarana movement including Aluru Venkata Rao were from northern parts of Karnataka. One of the earliest and most important organisations that was chosen to lead the movement, the Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha also began in Dharwad. The Vidyavardhaka Sangha and other organisations Participants of the first Kannada Sahitya Parishat The Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha, Dharwad, was established in 1890. It was established by R H Deshpande with the objective of working for the resurgence of the Kannada language which had been marginalised under the rule of the Bombay Presidency where Marathi was the official language. The Vidyavardhaka Sangha became the aegis under which leaders from all over Karnataka gathered to further their agitation. The influence and success of the Vidyavardhaka Sangha soon lead to more such organisations being set up throughout Karnataka. The most notable of these were the Kannada Sahitya Parishat (Bangalore) that was set up in 1915, the Karnataka Sangha (Shivamogga) that began in 1916 and the Karnataka Samithi in Kasaragod in 1955. Karnataka Samithi (R), Kasaragod Karnataka Samithi (R), Kasaragod was established in 1955 to advocate a merger of Kasaragod with Karanataka state. Umesha Rao, popularly known as Gadinadu Gandhi, was the first president of the organisation and the only person to be elected to the Kerala Assembly unanimously. On his death in 1957, B. S. Kakkillaya succeeded him as president until 1967. A prominent figure in the movement for unification of Karnataka, Kakkillaya was later honoured by the government of Karnataka, which gave the Suvarna Karnataka Ekikarana Award to the Samithi on the occasion of Suvarna Karnataka Rajyotsava in 2006. His photograph was among those used in the Karnataka Government's Suvarna Karnataka calendar of 2006. Kallige Mahabala Bhandari, an advocate, was elected to the Kerala Assembly from Manjeshwaram Constituency in Kasaragod under the Samithi banner. U. P. Kunikullaya was similarly elected in 1967. The efforts of the Samithi led to the Kasgarod unification issue being referred to the Justice Mahajan Commission by the government of India in 1966. B. V. Kakkillaya prepared a case for presentation before the commission, where K. R. Karanth, a former minister under Rajagopalachari in the then state of Madras and a leading advocate, represented the Samithi. The commission upheld the claim for merger of Kasaragod with the state of Karnataka. The Parliament of India is yet to take a final decision in the matter. B. V. Kakkillaya took over the presidency of the Samithi in 2000. During his term as president, the government of Kerala nominated him as a member of the State Level Committee for Linguistic Minorities in Kerala. He, too, received the Rajyotsava award in 2006. Aluru Venkata Rao Although resentment and protest had started as early as in 1856 and the Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha had been established in 1890, the movement took a dramatic turn with the arrival of Aluru Venkata Rao on the scene. Speaking at a meeting of the Sangha in 1903, Alur Venkata Rao made a case for integrating all Kannada regions of Madras Province and north Karnataka with Mysore kingdom. Aluru himself was inspired by the protests that followed the British partitioning of Bengal. In 1907 and again in 1908, Rao organised the All-Karnataka Writers' Conference in Dharwad. Inspired by the Vidyavardhaka Sangha and the efforts of Deshpande, Aluru helped found the Kannada Sahitya Parishat in Bangalore in 1915. This Parishat found a patron in the ruler of Mysore. The Parishat began holding annual literary conferences (that continue today) in different parts of the state. Intellectuals from across the Kannada speaking regions attended these conferences. During the Home Rule Movement, Aluru floated the idea of a Karnataka 'Provincial' unit of the Indian National Congress. This soon took shape and the Karnataka Pradesh Congress committee was formed. =Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava= Amidst all this, Aluru published his most renowned achievement, the Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava in 1912. Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava literally means The glory that was Karnataka!. It was a book that recounted in detail the history of Karnataka until the fall of Vijayanagar after which the Marathas, Nizam and the British took over. The book impacted the young and old alike. The movement soon caught the imagination of the public and people started rallying around the Ekikarana movement and the movement picked up momentum. For all these efforts and for being the one who inspired a whole movement, Aluru is today remembered as the Kannada Kula Purohita or the 'High priest of the Kannada clan'. British India Growth of the movement Starting with Aluru's call for a Kannada linguistic state, the movement had slowly started gaining momentum and following. It was also around the time that the Indian independence movement was gathering momentum. Organisations in the movement began organising rallies, talks and conferences where demands for a separate state for Kannada speaking people was made. Apart from Aluru, supporters like Gudleppa Hallikeri, Siddappa Kambli, R H Deshpande, Rangarao Diwakar, Koujalgi Srinivasarao, Srinivas Rao Mangalvedhe, Kengal Hanumanthaiah, Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar, S Nijalingappa, T Mariyappa, Subramanya, Sowcar Chennaiah, H K Veerangowda, H C Dasappa, H Siddaiah, K. R. Karanth, B. S. Kakkillaya, B. V. Kakkillaya and Anakru were by now prominent in the movement. Anakru in particular, was influential with his writing and oratory. Nagpur Conference Due to the efforts of these organisations and leaders, the movement not only gained in momentum but also attained a quasi- political influence. In 1920, Karnataka State Political Conference was held at Dharwad. At this conference, which was presided over by V P Madhav Rao, a unanimous resolution was passed demanding the unification of all Kannada speaking areas. The conference also advised Kannadigas to attend the Nagpur Congress to be held later that year in large numbers. Almost 800 delegates attended the Nagpur conference where the Indian National Congress made the decision to create the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee. This aided the movement and leaders of the Congress like S Nijalingappa and Kengal Hanumanthaiah (both of whom went on to become Chief Ministers of Karnataka) and Gudleppa Hallikeri also served as active members of the movement. 1924 Belgaum Conference In 1924, the Belgaum congress was held under the aegis of the newly formed Karnataka Pradesh Congress committee arm of the INC. Mahatma Gandhi presided over this historic conference. This conference was attended by Kannadigas from all parts in large numbers. The first Karnataka Unification Conference was also organised at the same venue. This was presided over by Siddappa Kambli. These two conferences were attended by a significant number of leaders, writers, poets and intellectuals from Karnataka. It was here that Huilgol Narayana Rao first sang his Udayavagali namma cheluva kannada nadu, which meant Let our charming Kannada land dawn!. The INC lent formal support to the cause; this was the first time the movement had explicit political support. As a result of these conferences, the Karnataka Ekikarana Sabha which was to work in collaboration with the KPCC began with the objective of the unification of Karnataka. The Karnataka Ekikarana Sabha later came to be known as the Karnataka Ekikarana Sangha. Nehru committee recommendation In 1928, due to the efforts of Gudleppa Hallikeri, the formation of a single province by uniting all Kannada speaking areas was recommended by the Nehru Committee. It was stated by the committee that there was a \\"strong prima facie case for unification\\". It also went on to state that it believed Karnataka could also be a financially strong province. This recommendation aided the movement. There was later support from literary figures like Kuvempu, Bendre, Gokak, S B Joshi, Betgeri Krishna Sharma, M Govinda Pai, Shivarama Karanth and Kayyara Kiyyanna Rai. There was also widespread support growing from the newspapers and media. Several smaller public and college organisations also began, notably in Bengaluru, Shivamogga and Raichur. 1937 elections Following the Simon Commission, elections were held in 1937. The Congress said it would favour the formation of the separate Karnataka and Andhra states. This was met with some resistance from the British and also some of the princely states. While the princely states feared that they might stand to lose some territory, the British themselves were unsure of how they would handle the reorganisation. Siddappa Kambli sensing the reluctance, decided that the movement had to approach the Simon Commission with their case. But the other leaders of the movement like Gangadharrao Deshpande, Rangarao Diwakar, Koujalgi Srinivasarao and Aluru advised him not to do so as they had boycotted the commission. Gudlappa Hallikeri invited the Maharaja of Mysore to tour the Kannada speaking provinces of Bombay and Hyderabad. After the tour and several discussions the movement gained his active support. 1946 conference The tenth conference of the Ekikarana movement was held on 10 January 1946 in Mumbai. This conference was inaugurated by Sardar Patel and attended by the likes of B. G. Kher, the then Chief Minister of Bombay presidency. In his speech at the conference, Sardar Patel stated that the interests of all linguistic groups would be high on the list of priorities for the new government of independent India. This served to reduce the apprehensions of the movement leaders and the common people. This was also to have a bearing on the constituent assembly that met in the same year. In the same year, the All- Karnataka convention, a gathering of Kannadigas was held in Davanagere, in central Karnataka. This was presided over by Mr. M P Patil, the revenue minister of Mumbai. This convention attracted tens of thousands of Kannadigas from Karnataka. Leaders like Gudlappa Hallikeri, Kengal Hanumanthaiah, T Mariyappa, Subramanya, Sowcar Chennaiah, H K Veerangowda, H C Dasappa and H Siddaiah attended this convention and urged the constituent assembly to create the linguistic states. Post Independence Political Divisions of Karnataka post Independence. India soon gained independence in 1947. The new government soon began delaying concerning the Karnataka Ekikarana movement. Kannada speaking areas were now grouped under five administrative units of the Bombay and Madras provinces, Kodagu, and the princely states of Mysore and Hyderabad. The Akhila Karnataka Ekikarana Parishat met in Kasargod and reiterated the demand for a separate state for Kannadigas. =Opposition by Mysore State= Ironically, the state of Mysore and several politicians opposed unification of Karnataka, on the pretext that Mysore state has fertile lands, more developed and present North Karnataka was not developed with large area of dry land. =Liberation of Hyderabad-Karnataka= While Karnataka became independent with the rest of the country on 15 August 1947, this did not occur in some parts of the state that were under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad. Hyderabad consisted of large portions of what were later to be the north eastern districts of Bidar, Gulbarga and Raichur of Karnataka state. The Lingayat minority in these regions also largely believed that they had been neglected and resented the oppression of the Nizam and the Razakars. The Nizam refused to accede to India until his rule was overthrown by force. Following the 'police action' against the Nizam, Hyderabad province and its citizens became independent on 17 September 1948. This day is celebrated by the Karnataka government as the Hyderabad-Karnataka liberation day. =The Dhar and JVP committee= In the same year, the government appointed the Dhar commission to look into the demands of the Ekikarana movement as well as those of the other parallel movements in the other states. The Dhar commission in its report, opposed any reorganisation of the states. This was criticised by all quarters including the Jaipur Congress. The government now formed the 'JVP' committee. This committee had Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Dr Pattabhi Sitaramayya on the board. This committee examined the demands again and created a report. The JVP report, however, favoured only the creation of the Andhra state while the Karnataka Ekikarana movement was deliberately ignored. The Ekikarana movement saw this as a betrayal of the Congress which had declared the creation of linguistic provinces as one of its goals in its 1951 manifesto. The movement now formed the Karnataka Ekikarana Paksha to contest the 1951 polls. This was supported by literary figures as well as politicians like Gudlappa Hallikeri, Kengal Hanumantayya, S Nijalingappa and C M Poonacha, the Chief Minister of Kodagu. =The Fazal Ali Committee= In January 1953, at the Congress session in Hyderabad, a resolution was also passed favouring the creation of Andhra Pradesh but not Karnataka. A. J. Dodmeti, a senior Congress leader and the member of the Bombay assembly, immediately resigned from his seat and launched a hunger strike at Jakkali in Dharwad. This was widely supported. In the riots at Hubli that followed, many people were injured and several courted arrest. In the Hubli-Dharwad by- elections that followed, the Congress were defeated while the Karnataka Ekikarana Paksha's candidate won by a landslide. Under pressure, Prime Minister Nehru constituted the States Reorganisation Commission (SRC), also known as the Fazal Ali commission due to being headed by Justice Fazal Ali. At the same time, the Mysore government appointed a fact-finding committee, headed by M. Sheshadri. The SRC opposed the unification but its findings were ignored due to overwhelming support in favour from Mysoreans such as Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. Congress leader Gudlappa Hallikeri furthered the cause of unification within his party by advocating for states based on linguistic demographics. He also represented and urged unification in front of the SRC. The SRC eventually recommended the reorganisation of the states based on linguistic demographics and this was soon ratified in parliament. Aftermath The ratification in parliament of the recommendations of the SRC was reacted to positively by Kannadiga people, although there was also disappointment at the non-inclusion of certain parts of Mysore state. Most notable among the excluded areas was Kasargod, which had been one of the centres from which the Ekikarana movement had launched its agitation. This is an issue that continues to affect those who fought for the unification of Karnataka. On 1 November 1973, under Devaraj Urs as Chief Minister, Mysore state was renamed as Karnataka. Ekikarana Awards To mark the celebrations of the 50th year of Karnataka's unification, the state government headed by the then Chief Minister H D Kumarswamy awarded 36 individuals and 4 organisations with the Ekikarana Award for the service they had rendered for uniting Karnataka. The Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha, Dharwad and the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Bengalooru (that Aluru once assisted and headed) and Karnataka Samithi (R), Kasaragod were included among the recipients.

Saints Theodorus (ca. 775-ca. 842) and Theophanes (ca. 778-845), called the Grapti (from the Greek graptoi, \\"written upon\\"), are remembered as proponents of the veneration of icons during the second Iconoclastic controversy. They were brothers and natives of Jerusalem. Joint History Theophanes Vita prima was recorded in the Life of Michael the Synkellos.Dr. Mary Cunningham, The Life of Michael the Synkellos (Belfast Byzantine Texts and Translations, 1991), . Theophanes and his brother Theodore were born in Palestine near the end of the eighth century, sons of the Venerable Jonah the Presbyter. Both grew up in Jerusalem, entered the Monastery of Mar Sabba near Bethlehem together, and became disciples of St. Michael the Synkellos (later syncellus of the Patriarch of Jerusalem). In 813 Michael and his two disciples left Jerusalem originally on a journey to Rome. They had been sent by the Patriarch of Jerusalem to support the Pope in his stand against the Franks over the question of the filioque, which some Benedictines from the West had recently introduced to Jerusalem. In the course of their journey, in about 812, they landed in Constantinople, entered a monastery, and where in opposition to the Emperor Leo V (813-20) they energetically defended the veneration of images. However, the Seventh Ecumenical Council had condemned Iconoclasm as a heresy, so they were detained, interrogated, beaten and imprisoned by order of the Emperor Leo V (the Armenian) in 815. During the whole of the second iconoclast period‚Äînearly thirty years‚Äîthey suffered at various times exile, imprisonment and torture. Under the succeeding emperor, Michael II (820-29), they were brought into the monastery of Sosthenes on the Bosphorus. Michael's successor, the tyrannical and Iconoclastic Theophilos (829-42), exiled them again, but recalled them in 836 to the capital, had them scourged several times, and had twelve lines of verse cut into their skin (hence the nickname \\"written upon\\"). Theophilus beat them with his own hand and ordered that they be branded on their faces with twelve lines of ‚Äòbadly composed‚Äô‚Äî the emperor‚Äôs own words ‚Äî, if metrically correct, quantitative iambic verses. The ordeal took two days. They were thrown into prison in the town of Apamea in Bithynia, where Theodore died in prison of his wounds in 841. Michael and Theophanes survived to see Orthodoxy triumph over Iconoclasm in 842 during the reign of the Empress Theodora. Michael was made abbot of the Monastery of Chora, where he died, just two months after Theophanes, in January 846. The brothers are venerated as saints. In the Eastern Orthodox Church the feast of Theophanes is observed on 11 October, that of Theodorus on 27 December. In the Roman Church the feasts of both are celebrated on 27 December (Cf. Nilles, \\"Kalendarium manuale utriusque Ecclesi√¶\\", I, 300, 368 sq.). Theophanes the Branded Theophanes the Branded also called Theophanes Graptus or Theophanes of Nicaea (775 - 845) was a Byzantine monk and hymnographer. Next to Joseph the Hymnographer, Theophanes is the major contributor to the Orthodox liturgical book called the Parakletike. Theophanes was consecrated as Metropolitan of Nicaea by Patriarch Methodius in 842 and administered it until his death in 845. =Works= Theophanes wrote a large number of religious poems, among them one on his dead brother. (cf. Christ and Paranikas, \\"Anthologia gr√¶ca carminum christianorum\\", Leipzig, 1781). As a hymnographer, Theophanes belongs to the tradition of the Lavra of Mar Sabbas, which includes many of the greatest writers of canons, including St Andrew of Crete, St Kosmas of Ma√Øouma and St John of Damascus. His contribution to the Parakletike consists of sets of canons in all Eight Tones for the Angels, and the Departed. He is sometimes said also to have written a set for the Apostles, but those in Tones 7 and 8 are ascribed to Joseph in the Paraklitiki, that in Tone 7 being ‚Äòsigned‚Äô acrostically in the Ninth Ode. Not all of these are ‚Äòsigned‚Äô in the acrostic, but that for the Angels in Tone 1 has as its acrostic the following, ‚ÄòThe first hymn of Theophanes for the Angels‚Äô, while that for the departed in Tone 5 has, ‚ÄòThe fifth canon of Theophanes for the dead‚Äô. Unfortunately none of these texts has been critically edited and the printed service books often differ widely in their ascriptions.

The text was originally written in Latin. It is a metrical paraphrase of the O Antiphons, a series of plainchant antiphons attached to the Magnificat at Vespers over the final days before Christmas. The hymn has its origins over 1,200 years ago in monastic life in the 8th or 9th century. Seven days before Christmas Eve monasteries would sing the ‚ÄúO antiphons‚Äù in anticipation of Christmas Eve when the eighth antiphon, ‚ÄúO Virgo virginum‚Äù (‚ÄúO Virgin of virgins‚Äù) would be sung before and after Mary‚Äôs canticle, the Magnificat (Luke 1:46b-55). The Latin metrical form of the hymn was composed as early as the 12th century.History of Hymns: ‚ÄúO Come, O Come, Emmanuel‚Äù, https://www.umcdiscipleship.org/resources/history-of-hymns-o-come- o-come-emmanuel The 1861 translation by John Mason Neale from Hymns Ancient and Modern is the most prominent by far in the English-speaking world, but other English translations also exist. Translations into other modern languages (particularly German) are also in widespread use. While the text may be used with many metrical hymn tunes, it was first combined with its most famous tune, often itself called Veni Emmanuel, in the English-language Hymnal Noted in 1851. Later, the same tune was used with versions of \\"O come, O come, Emmanuel\\" in other languages, including Latin.  Origin  The words and the music of \\"O come, O come, Emmanuel\\" developed separately. The Latin text is first documented in Germany in 1710, whereas the tune most familiar in the English-speaking world has its origins in 15th-century France. =Of the text= The pre-history of the text stretches back to the origins of the O Antiphons themselves, which were in existence by, at the latest, the eighth century. However, to speak meaningfully of the text of the hymn per se, they would need to be paraphrased in strophic, metrical form. It is certainly within the realm of possibility that efforts along those lines could have been made quite early; we know, for instance, that they were paraphrased extensively by the English poet Cynewulf in a poem written before the year 800. However, despite popular imagination of an early origin for \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel,\\" the hymn's history is first substantiated only much later.  First publication: Psalteriolum Cantionum Catholicarum  While \\"O come, O come, Emmanuel\\" is often linked with the 12th century (or earlier centuries), the earliest surviving evidence of the hymn's text is in the seventh edition of Psalteriolum Cantionum Catholicarum, which was published in Cologne in 1710. That hymnal was a major force in the history of German church music: first assembled by Jesuit hymnographer Johannes Heringsdorf in 1610 and receiving numerous revised editions through 1868, it achieved enormous impact due to its use in Jesuit schools.Theo Hamacher, \\"Das Psalteriolum cantionum, das Geistliche Ps√§lterlein u. ihr Herausgeber P. Johannes Heringsdorf SJ,\\" Westf√§lische Zeitschrift 110 (1960), 285 ff. The text of the Psalteriolum Cantionum Catholicarum version is essentially expanded, rather than altered, over the subsequent centuries. That version exhibits all of the hymn's characteristic qualities: it is strophic and metrical (in the 88.88.88.88 hymn meter), and the order is altered so that the last of the O Antiphons (the titular \\"Veni Emmanuel\\") becomes the first verse of the hymn. Each stanza consists of a four-line verse, which adapts one of the antiphons, and a new two-line refrain (\\"Gaude, gaude! Emmanuel \\\\ nascetur pro te, Israel,\\" i.e., \\"Rejoice, Rejoice! Emmanuel will be born for you, O Israel\\"), which provides an explicitly Advent-oriented response to the petition of the verse. This first version of the hymn includes five verses, corresponding to five of the seven standard O Antiphons, in the following order: # \\"Veni, veni Emmanuel!\\" = \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\" # \\"Veni, O Jesse Virgula\\" = \\"O Come, Thou Rod of Jesse\\" # \\"Veni, veni, O Oriens\\" = \\"O come, Thou Dayspring, from on High\\" # \\"Veni, clavis Davidica\\" = \\"O come, Thou Key of David, come\\" # \\"Veni, veni, Adonai\\" = \\"O come, Adonai, Lord of might\\" Thesaurus Hymnologicus (1844) Text in Daniel, Thesaurus Hymnologicus (1844) In 1844, \\"Veni, veni Emmanuel\\" was included in the second volume of Thesaurus Hymnologicus, a monumental collection by the German hymnologist Hermann Adalbert Daniel. While the Latin text in this version was unchanged from Psalteriolum Cantionum Catholicarum, Daniel's work would prove significant for the hymn in two ways. First, the Thesaurus would help to ensure a continued life for the Latin version of the hymn even as the Psalteriolum came to the end of its long history in print. Second ‚Äî and even more significantly for the English- speaking world ‚Äî it was from Thesaurus Hymnologicus that John Mason Neale would come to know the hymn. Neale would both publish the Latin version of the hymn in Britain and translate the first (and still most important) English versions.Raymond F. Glover, The Hymnal 1982 Companion, vol. 1 (New York: Church Publishing, 1995), 56 () Expansion of text This five-verse version of the hymn left two of the O Antiphons unused. Possibly under the influence of the Cecilian Movement in Germany, two new verses ‚Äî \\"Veni, O Sapientia\\" (lit. \\"Come, O Wisdom\\") and \\"Veni, Rex Gentium\\" (lit. \\"Come, King of Peoples\\") ‚Äî were added that adapted the remaining antiphons. No precise date or authorship is known for these verses. At present, their first known publication is in Joseph Hermann Mohr's Cantiones Sacrae of 1878, which prints a seven-stanza Latin version in the order of the antiphons (i.e. with \\"Sapientia\\" as the first verse and \\"Emmanuel\\" as the last verse).Joseph Mohr, SJ, ed., Cantiones Sacrae (New York: Frederick Pustet, 1878), p. 81, hymn #36 Digitized version =Of the music= Because \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" is a metrical hymn in the common 88.88.88 meter scheme (in some hymnals given as \\"8.8.8.8 and refrain\\"), it is possible to pair the words of the hymn with any number of tunes. The meter is shared between the original Latin text and the English translation. However, at least in the English-speaking world, \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" is associated with one tune more than any other, to the extent that the tune itself is often called Veni Emmanuel. The \\"Veni Emmanuel\\" tune The familiar tune called \\"Veni Emmanuel\\" was first linked with this hymn in 1851, when Thomas Helmore published it in the Hymnal Noted, paired with an early revision of Neale's English translation of the text. The volume listed the tune as being \\"From a French Missal in the National Library, Lisbon.\\"Hymnal Noted, parts I & II (New York: Novello, 1851), 131 (Hymn 65 or 30) Google Books However, Helmore provided no means by which to verify his source, leading to long-lasting doubts about its attribution. There was even speculation that Helmore might have composed the melody himself. The mystery was settled in 1966 by British musicologist Mary Berry (also an Augustinian canoness and noted choral conductor), who discovered a 15th-century manuscript containing the melody in the National Library of France.Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale, m.s. lat. 10581, ff. 89v-101. View scanned MS from BnF For a modern transcription by Peter Woetmann Christoffersen, see pp. 11‚Äì18 of this PDF. The manuscript consists of processional chants for burials. The melody used by Helmore is found here with the text \\"Bone Jesu dulcis cunctis\\"; it is part of a series of two-part tropes to the responsory Libera me. As Berry (writing under her name in religion, Mother Thomas More) points out in her article on the discovery, \\"Whether this particular manuscript was the actual source to which [Helmore] referred we cannot tell at present.\\" (Recall that Hymnal Noted referred to Lisbon, not Paris, and to a missal, not a processional.) Berry raised the possibility that there might exist \\"an even earlier version of\\" the melody.Mother Thomas More, \\"O Come O Come Emmanuel,\\" The Musical Times 107, no. 1483 (Sept. 1966), 772 JSTOR However, there is no evidence to suggest that this tune was connected with this hymn before Helmore's hymnal; thus, the two would have first come together in English. Nonetheless, because of the nature of metrical hymns, it is perfectly possible to pair this tune with the Latin text; versions doing so exist by Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Philip Lawson and , among others. In the German language, Das katholische Gesangbuch der Schweiz (\\"The Catholic Hymnal of Switzerland\\") and Gesangbuch der Evangelisch-reformierten Kirchen der deutschsprachigen Schweiz (\\"The Hymnal of the Evangelical-Reformed Churches of German-speaking Switzerland\\"), both published in 1998, adapt a version of the text by Henry Bone that usually lacks a refrain to use it with this melody.At KG 304 and RG 362 divisio = { \\\\override BreathingSign.Y-offset = #0 \\\\override BreathingSign.minimum-X-extent = #'(-1.0 . 0.0) \\\\override BreathingSign.minimum-Y-extent = #'(-2.5 . 2.5) } maxima = { \\\\divisio \\\\once \\\\override BreathingSign.stencil = #ly:breathing-sign::divisio-maxima \\\\breathe } finalis = { \\\\divisio \\\\once \\\\override BreathingSign.stencil = #ly:breathing- sign::finalis \\\\breathe } \\\\header { tagline = ##f } \\\\score { << \\\\language \\"english\\" ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" \\\\remove \\"Bar_engraver\\" midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" } << \\\\key g \\\\major ew Voice = \\"melody\\" { \\\\voiceOne \\\\relative c' { e2 \\\\mark \\\\markup { \\\\italic \\"In free rhythm\\" \\\\smallCaps Unison } g b b b a( c b) a g \\\\maxima a b g e g a( fs e) d e1.\\\\fermata \\\\finalis a2 a e e fs g1( fs2) e d1. \\\\maxima g2 a b b b a( c b) a g1.\\\\fermata \\\\finalis \\\\break d'2 \\\\mark \\\\markup { \\\\smallCaps Refrain } d1 r2 b2 b1 r2 \\\\maxima b2 a( c b) a g a b g e g a( fs e) d e1. \\\\fermata \\\\finalis } } ew Voice { \\\\voiceTwo \\\\relative c' { e2 e <> <> <> <> <> <> d( \\\\maxima <> <> d) c d <> d b s b1. \\\\finalis e2 c e b d d e d cs s1. \\\\maxima <> <> <> <> <> <> <> <> d1. \\\\finalis <> <> r2 <> <> r2 \\\\maxima <> <> <> <> d <> <> <> <> d <> d b1 b1. \\\\finalis } } >> ew Lyrics \\\\with { \\\\override VerticalAxisGroup #'staff-affinity = #CENTER } \\\\lyricsto \\"melody\\" \\\\lyricmode { O come, O come Im -- man -- u -- el, And ran -- som cap -- tive Is -- ra -- el That mourns in lone -- ly ex -- ile here Un -- til the son of God ap -- pear.

The hymn text was embraced both out of a Romantic interest in poetic beauty and medieval exoticism and out of a concern for matching hymns to liturgical seasons and functions rooted in the Oxford Movement in the Church of England. The Hymnal Noted, in which the words and tune were first combined, represented the \\"extreme point\\" of these forces. This hymnal \\"consisted entirely of versions of Latin hymns, designed for use as Office hymns within the Anglican Church despite the fact that Office hymns had no part in the authorized liturgy. The music was drawn chiefly from plainchant,\\" as was the case with the Veni Emmanuel tune for \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel,\\" the combination of which has been cited as an exemplar of this new style of hymnody. \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" was thus ideally situated to benefit from the cultural forces that would bring about Hymns Ancient and Modern in 1861. This new hymnal was a product of the same ideological forces that paired it with the Veni Emmanuel tune, ensuring its inclusion, but was also designed to achieve commercial success beyond any one party of churchmanship, incorporating high-quality hymns of all ideological approaches. The volume succeeded wildly; by 1895, Hymns Ancient and Modern was being used in three quarters of English churches. The book \\"probably did more than anything else to spread the ideas of the Oxford Movement\\" (which include the aesthetics of \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\") \\"so widely that many of them became imperceptibly a part of the tradition of the Church as a whole.\\" Its musical qualities in particular \\"became an influence far beyond the boundaries of the Church of England.\\" It is very reflective of these cultural forces that the form of \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" in Hymns Ancient and Modern remains predominant in the English-speaking world. (This predominance encompasses not just the Veni Emmanuel tune, but also the revised English translation that included, for example, the title used in this article ‚Äî see the section O Come, O Come, Emmanuel ¬ß English versions below.) =Other tunes= While the \\"Veni Emmanuel\\" tune predominates in the English-speaking world, several others have been closely associated with the hymn. In the United States, some Lutheran hymnals use the tune \\"St. Petersburg\\" by Dmitry Bortniansky for \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.\\"vid. e.g.: O. Hardwig, ed., The Wartburg Hymnal (Chicago: Wartburg Publishing House, 1918), #78; Andreas Bersagel et al., eds., The Concordia Hymnal (Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing House, 1932), #118 via Hymns and Carols of Christmas A Moravian hymnal from the US gives a tune attributed to Charles GounodHymnal and Liturgies of the Moravian Church (Bethlehem, PA: Provincial Synod, 1920), #106 via Hymns and Carols of Christmas Alternative tunes are particularly common in the German-speaking world, where the text of the hymn originated, especially as the hymn was in use there for many years before Helmore's connection of it to the \\"Veni Emmanuel\\" tune became known. Among several German paraphrases of the hymn, one is attributed to Christoph Bernhard Verspoell ‚Äî one of the earliest and most influential to arise around the late-18th/early-19th century. It is associated with its own distinctive tune, which has enjoyed exceptionally long-lasting popularity in the Diocese of M√ºnster.\\"O komm, o komm Emanuel:\\" \\"Evergreen\\" im Bistrum A more faithful German translation by Henry Bone became the vehicle for a tune from JBC Schmidts' Sammlung von Kirchenges√§ngen f√ºr katholische Gymnasien (D√ºsseldorf 1836), which remains popular in German diocesan song- books and regional editions of the monolithic hymnal Gotteslob. This melody was carried across the Atlantic by Johann Baptist Singenberger, where it remains in use through the present in some Catholic communities in the United States. The Archdiocese of Cologne's supplement to Gotteslob (#829) includes a tune by CF Ackens (Aachen, 1841) with the Bone translation. A version by Bone without a refrain is commonly connected with a tune from the Andernacher Gesangbuch (Cologne, 1608), but it can also be used with the melody of the medieval Latin hymn Conditor alme siderum, further demonstrating the flexibility of metrical hymnody. Text The text of \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel,\\" in all its various versions, is a metrical paraphrase of the O Antiphons, so the intricate theological allusions of the hymn are essentially the same as for the antiphons. One notable difference is that the antiphon \\"O Radix Jesse\\" (\\"root\\" of Jesse) is generally rendered in meter as \\"Veni, O Iesse virgula\\" (\\"shoot\\" of Jesse). Both refer to the writings of the prophet Isaiah ( and , respectively), but the hymn's \\"virgula\\" precludes the formation of the acrostic \\"ero cras\\" from the antiphons. =Latin text= As discussed above, the Latin text of \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" was mostly stable over time. In the versions below, a number at the end of each stanza indicates where it fits into the order of the O Antiphons (e.g. the first verse, \\"Veni, veni Emmanuel,\\" corresponds with the last antiphon, [7]). Original Five- Stanza Text from Psalteriolum Cantionum Catholicarum (1710) =Additional stanzas from Cantiones Sacrae (1878)= =English versions= John Mason Neale John Mason Neale published the five-verse Latin version, which he had presumably learned from Daniels' Thesaurus Hymnologicus,Raymond F. Glover, The Hymnal 1982 Companion, vol. 1 (New York: Church Publishing, 1995), 56 () in his 1851 collection Hymni Ecclesiae.John Mason Neale, Hymni ecclesiae: e breviariis quibusdam et missalibus gallicanis, germanis, hispanis, lusitanis desumpti (Oxford: J.H. Parker, 1851), 57 (Google Books) In the same year, Neale published the first documented English translation, beginning with \\"Draw nigh, draw nigh, Emmanuel,\\" in Medi√¶val Hymns and Sequences. He revised this version for The Hymnal Noted, followed by a further revision, in 1861, for Hymns Ancient and Modern. This version, now with the initial line reading \\"O come, O come, Emmanuel,\\" would attain hegemony in the English-speaking world (aside from minor variations from hymnal to hymnal).Hymns ancient and modern: for use in the services of the church (London: Novello, 1861), hymn #36 (Google Books digitization of the 1867 edition) Thomas Alexander Lacey (1853‚Äì1931) created a new translation (also based on the five-verse version) for The English Hymnal in 1906, but it received only limited use.The English Hymnal (London: Oxford UP, 1906), hymn #8 (see p. 12 of the PDF via IMSLP) It is noteworthy that the text is here correctly listed as 18th cent. in origin. It would take until the 20th century for the additional two stanzas to receive significant English translations. The translation published by Henry Sloane Coffin in 1916 ‚Äî which included only the \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" verse by Neale and Coffin's two \\"new\\" verses ‚Äî gained the broadest acceptance, with occasional modifications.Henry Sloane Coffin and Ambrose White Vernon, eds., Hymns of the Kingdom of God, revised ed. (New York: The A.S. Barnes Company, 1916), Hymn #37. Quoted in Hymns and Carols of Christmas. A full seven-verse English version officially appeared for the first time in 1940, in the Hymnal of the Episcopal Church. Contemporary English hymnals print various versions ranging from four to eight verses. The version included in the Hymnal 1982 of the Episcopal Church is typical: there are eight stanzas, with \\"Emmanuel\\" as both the first and the last stanza. From this version, six lines date from the original 1851 translation by Neale, nine from the version from Hymns Ancient and Modern (1861), eleven (including the two supplementary stanzas, following Coffin) from the Hymnal 1940, and the first two lines of the fourth stanza (\\"O come, thou Branch of Jesse's tree, \\\\ free them from Satan's tyranny\\") are unique to this hymnal.Raymond F.

The school is owned by Cognita. AIS is made up of three sub-schools: Early Years (for children aged 2 months to 6 years); an Elementary School (for students in Prep to Year 5) and a Secondary School (Year 6 to Year 12). AIS engages different global curricula across its sub- schools. In 2007, the school adopted the International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Program (PYP) for Elementary students. In Secondary school, students take the Australian Curriculum (Years 6 to 8); the Cambridge IGCSE (Years 9 and 10) and for Years 11 and 12, students have the choice between the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IB DP) or the New South Wales (NSW) Higher School Certificate (HSC) examinations. AIS has implemented a pro- active response to the COVID-19 situation and has facilitated home-based learning in April and May 2020. History The Australian International School opened on 3 February 1993 at its first campus on Mount Sophia, an area behind Plaza Singapura and the Cathay Building reconstruction. The School started under the leadership of Miss Coral Dickson with 32 students and 7 teachers, with no air-conditioning, uniform or facilities that are now taken for granted. By the end of 1993 there were over 200 students. The school experienced rapid growth and by the end of July 1994, with numbers just over 500, the students moved to Emerald Hill, directly behind Orchard Road. Although the School was bigger and could accommodate more students it still did not have a full‚Äìsized gym, pool, theatre and other much needed facilities. As the School continued to expand it was clear that space was running out at Emerald Hill and by the end of 1997, AIS had moved to Ulu Pandan, near Clementi, the site of the old Singapore American School, which had recently moved to a new site at Woodlands. The School enjoyed just over 5 years at Ulu Pandan during which time it finally secured land to construct a purpose built school at Lorong Chuan, with first class facilities. In February 2002, Mr Peter Bond began as Principal of AIS. The School moved from Ulu Pandan to its final \\"home\\" at Lorong Chuan over the holidays in July 2003, with 1100 students enrolled. The school was officially opened by then Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, John Anderson and Singapore's then Acting Minister for Education, Tharman Shanmugaratnam. In October 2007, the School was purchased by the Cognita Group of Schools and in July 2008, a Junior School and Preschool wing were built to house children from Preschool to Year 2 at a purpose-built facility. The campus is a bright, airy and semi-modern building with large pod spaces for group work. In 2011, a new Senior building was opened to accommodate Year 10, 11 and 12 students. This wing incorporates private study spaces, nearly 40 classrooms and a new Science, Art, Music and Technology area. In January 2012, Dr Nick Miller took over as Principal of AIS, and the School moved to a new school structure with two sub-schools: Elementary School (Preschool, Junior School and Primary School) and Secondary School. In March 2014, Dr Nick Miller announced his resignation as the Principal of AIS. At the end of 2014, Andre Casson took over as Principal of AIS. Currently there are roughly 2800 students enrolled and the School employs over 220 members of teaching staff. Leadership Team The school's executive team comprises: * Andre Casson (Head of School) * Dr Edward Groughan (Principal) * PJ Roberts (Managing Director - Operations) *Rachael Symes (Head of Early Years) * Adam Patterson (Head of Elementary) * Kalea Haran (Head of Secondary) * Dr Kirrilee Hughes (Director of Marketing and Admissions) * Anita Mahesan (Director of Finance) Ownership AIS has been privately owned by Cognita since 2007. Cognita is an international independent schools group. Founded in 2004, the Cognita family of schools now incorporates over 69 schools world-wide, with schools in the UK, Spain, South America, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam, covering the age range of 3 ‚Äì 18 years.  Curriculum  AIS' Early Years is inspired by the principles of the Reggio Emilia teaching philosophy, which places the child at the centre of the learning journey and values he environment as the 'third teacher'. Children are given the opportunity to explore the environment around them, where new discoveries can be made. Instead of restricting students to a rigid learning format, the curriculum allows them to acquire knowledge based on their innate learning abilities. The Australian Curriculum begins at Nursery and extends through to Year 8. Alongside this, the globally renowned International Baccalaureate Primary Years Program (IB PYP) is introduced from Early Years to Year 5 in the Elementary School, supported by selected complementary teaching methodologies and a curriculum framework specific to the needs of students. In Years 9 and 10, all AIS students take the Cambridge IGCSE, the world's most popular international qualification for this age group. The Cambridge IGCSE is highly regarded for its academic rigour and for preparing students for their senior secondary years. In Years 11 and 12, AIS offers the choice between two highly challenging graduation programs: the New South Wales Higher School Certificate (NSW) or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IB DP). .

She was based in Santa Barbara, California. Early life Mildred Cooper was born in Buenos Aires, the daughter of Reginald Cooper and Harriet Hathaway Jacobs. Her father was born in England; her mother was born in Argentina to American-born parents. She began her serious musical studies at the Williams Conservatory in Argentina, and pursued further training in Italy, Germany and France, where she studied piano with Moritz Moszkowski and composition with Nadia Boulanger.Nicole V.

She moved with her children to California in 1927 and established a studio in Santa Barbara, where she started her experiments with two pianos by tuning the first a quarter tone higher than the second. This increased the normal 88 pitch levels to 176, expanding so the gamut by a quarter step to emphasize the character of the harmony.Maurice Hinson, Music for More Than One Piano: An Annotated Guide, p. 42, Indiana University Press (2001), Her first work in this medium was the ballet Xanadu (1930), which was performed in the production of Eugene O'Neill's Marco Millions in the Lobero Theatre.

The governing body is the United States Field Hockey Association (USFHA), which is a US Olympic Committee organization. The team won Bronze at the 1932 Summer Olympics, and has had success in the Pan American Games and Pan American Cup. Field hockey is not a major sport at college level in the United States, so the men's team does not have as much experience as most other international teams that have professional players. The sport is largely thought of as a women's game in the United States; field hockey has historically been used as a ‚ÄúTitle IX‚Äù sport to offset the numerous men who play college football, and as such, colleges have typically only sponsored women's field hockey teams. The players on the national team play overseas in European and Australian pro leagues. Tournament history =Summer Olympics= In their first Olympics in 1932, team USA hosted India and Japan. With only three teams in the tournament, the U.S. lost both their games and finished third for the Bronze medal. The team was again the host nation for the Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Games. During group stages, they lost to Australia 2‚Äì1. In the 9th-12th place playoff, the US lost to Kenya in sudden death penalty strokes 6-5 after a 1-1 regulation and then lost 11th/12th place game to Malaysia 9‚Äì8 in sudden death penalty strokes after 3‚Äì3 tie in regulation.

The Trust for Public Land ranks one part of Mill Creek as the 142nd largest park located within the limits of a US city. Mill Creek MetroParks now stretches from the near west side of Youngstown to the southern borders of the city and neighboring Boardman township. The park \\"encompasses approximately 4400 acres (10.5 km¬≤), 20 mi (32 km) of drives, and 15 mi (24 km) of foot trails\\" as well as a variety of bridges, ponds, streams, well-tended gardens, and waterfalls. If including the total size of the park system, Mill Creek ranks among the largest metropolitan-owned parks within the city limits of any US city.  History  Mill Creek Park was founded in 1891 due to the \\"untiring efforts of Youngstown attorney Volney Rogers.\\" Rogers secured options on much of the land and was able to purchase large tracts of it. This was no small task given that he was compelled to deal with more than 90 landowners. Once the land was secured, Rogers framed and promoted what he called the \\"Township Park Improvement Law.\\" Upon the law's passage, Rogers turned over all of the land he had secured for park purposes. Rogers had the area declared a park by the state legislature. It officially opened in 1893. Rogers enlisted the help of his brother Bruce, who had studied landscape architecture and became the first park superintendent.The Youngstown Vindicator, Youngstown, Ohio, December 1, 1946 In 1899, the project benefited from the contributions of well-known landscape architect Charles Eliot. The Olmsted Brothers firm provided extensive design work from 1923‚Äì1962. The same year that the park opened, the Mahoning County commissioners issued bonds to pay for the parkland, and Rogers purchased $25,000 of them, with the understanding that they would be the last ones paid. Ironically, the financial panic of 1893 facilitated the park's development. As a later newspaper account observed: \\"Unemployed men found work there. A second bond issue paid for their wages. The men cut trails, established drives, restored Pioneer Pavilion (a renovated factory building that was the oldest structure in the park) and built Lake Cohasset Dam\\". =Fellows Riverside Gardens= Formal entrance to Fellows Riverside Gardens. Fellows Riverside Gardens is a free public garden located at the northern end of Mill Creek MetroParks. Its twelve acres feature a landscape of diverse and colorful plant displays, roses of all classes, seasonal displays of annuals, perennials, flowering bulbs, and scenic vistas. The D. D. and Velma Davis Education & Visitor Center has made the Gardens an all-season destination. Fellows Riverside Gardens attracts over 400,000 visitors a year. =Mill Creek Golf Course= Mill Creek Golf Course features two 18-hole championship courses designed by Donald Ross that opened to the public in 1928. Both courses are par 70 with four sets of tees, stretching from 5095 yards to 6511 yards. The South Course plays over a flat terrain with tree-lined fairways. Natural areas and streams come into play on five holes. The South Course has been selected by Golfweek as one of America‚Äôs 30 Best Municipal Courses. The North Course weaves through tall trees and includes a variety of natural hazards. =Lanterman's Mill= Lanterman's Mill in Mill Creek Park Lanterman's Mill was built in 1845‚Äì46 by German Lanterman and Samuel Kimberly. Restored in 1982‚Äì85 through a gift from the Ward and Florence Beecher Foundations, this community treasure represents one of the many pioneer industries developed along Mill Creek and operates today as it did in the 1800s, grinding corn, wheat, and buckwheat. The nearby East Gorge Walk and West Gorge Trail offer a peek into the area's geologic history. Listed in the Mid-America Walking Atlas, the award-winning Gorge Trail is a two-mile loop along Mill Creek that consists of a boardwalk bordered on one side by the stream and on the other side by a massive wall of sandstone. =Ford Nature Center= The Ford Nature Education Center opened to the public in 1972 as the headquarters for the Park‚Äôs nature education programs in the northern part of Mill Creek Park. The education center is housed within the stone mansion donated to the Park in 1968 by the children of the late Judge John W. Ford. A staff of naturalists at the Ford Nature Center offer a variety of programming throughout the year including hikes, school programs, workshops, and special events. Displays include the depiction of plants and animals of four local habitats, a children's interactive discovery room and a room with live turtles, snakes and other animals native to northeast Ohio. The Center also houses a library, bird observation area, teachers‚Äô resource center and a gift shop. The grounds include wildlife gardens and walking trails. Lakes, ponds and wetlands Mill Creek Park contains three man-made lakes, a pond and a wetland. =Lake Glacier= Lake Glacier was created in 1906 by the damming of Mill Creek at the \\"narrows\\" as it approached the Mahoning River. This 44-acre lake has provided recreational opportunities for many generations. Boating and fishing are permitted in season. Kayaks and pedalos are available to rent at the Glacier Boathouse on West Glacier Drive. A passenger boat is available for individual rides and group reservations. A barrier-free fishing dock is located along West Glacier Drive. Hikers can access Old Tree Trail and East Glacier Trail. =Lake Newport and wetlands= In 1924, Alice Baldwin Lewis donated 70 acres of land specifying that part of the land was to be used for creating a lake. Mill Creek meandered through this shallow valley making it a suitable site for a man-made lake. In 1928 a dam was built, creating what is now known as Lake Newport. Lake Newport, the largest of Mill Creek Park's three lakes, offers 60 acres of open water and 40 acres of wetlands. Boating and fishing are permitted in season. A boat launch is located on East Newport Drive. Kayaks and pedalos are available to rent at the Boathouse on West Newport Drive. The Newport Wetlands, located at the southern end of the lake, provide habitat for a variety of plants and animals. Visitors can experience this complex web of flora and fauna by walking the Albert E. Davies Wetland Trail, a boardwalk through the wetlands with interpretive signs along the way. =Lake Cohasset= Lake Cohasset, the oldest of Mill Creek Park's lakes, was built in 1897 and is known for its hemlocks. The name comes from the Algonquin word \\"Conahasset\\", meaning \\"long rocky place\\". This 28-acre lake offers visitors a secluded place to view wildlife in their natural habitats. Boating and fishing are not permitted on Lake Cohasset. =Lily pond= Migrating waterfowl and resident goldfish have made this four-acre pond a popular site since 1896. The Lily Pond Circle Trail loops around the pond, providing a path for visiting recreationalists.

Hoffman's studio, ca. 1895 Frank Vincent DuMond (August 20, 1865 ‚Äì February 6, 1951) was one of the most influential teacher-painters in 20th- century America. He was an illustrator and American Impressionist painter of portraits and landscapes, and a prominent teacher who instructed thousands of art students throughout a career spanning over fifty years. Early life and education Frank Vincent DuMond was born on August 20, 1865 in Rochester, New York, to Elisabeth and Alonzo DuMond, partner/owner of an ornamental iron works manufacturer. He was interested in drawing from a young age, and was involved in the local art scene in the early 1880s. He got a job creating illustrations for a sign painting business.Archives of American Art Journal, p. 26. After graduating from a Rochester public school, DuMond moved to New York City in 1884. From 1884 to 1888, he attended the Art Students League of New York, studying under Carroll Beckwith and William Sartain. DuMond financed his art education by taking a job creating illustrations for New York's Daily Graphic newspaper. As a result of his fine work there, he was offered a job at Harper's Weekly. He also later did work for such magazines as Century, McClure's, and Scribner's. He moved to Paris to continue his studies. From 1888 or 1889 to 1891 he attended Acad√©mie Julian,askart.com where his instructors included Benjamin Constant, Jules Joseph Lefebvre, and Gustav Boulanger. He attained recognition in 1890 when a painting of his, Holy Family, exhibited at the Salon, was awarded a prestigious medal. His early work was in the Art Nouveau style, then in Paris he was influenced by the Barbizon school, later becoming an Impressionist. In 1895 he married Helen Savier of Portland, Oregon, another artist. They spent five years painting in France, where he also held summer classes for the Art Students League, painting landscapes outdoors from dawn until sunset. In 1900 he was elected into the National Academy of Design, and became a full Academician in 1906. Iris Work DuMond exhibited at the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, and the Saint Louis Exposition. He served as director of fine arts at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland in 1905, and he helped organize the first exhibition at the Portland Art Museum that year. For the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition, he prepared two huge murals, 12 feet high by 47 feet long, which now hang in the San Francisco Public Library. \\"The Capture of the Tourelles\\" ‚Äì illustration from Mark Twain's Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc The editor of Harper's, who was also president of the Art Students League, convinced him to take a job teaching at the League. He still performed illustration work for a while in addition to teaching, including the artwork for Mark Twain's Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc. In a teaching career spanning more than fifty years, DuMond taught thousands of artists at the Art Students League. His students included Norman Rockwell, Georgia O'Keeffe, John Marin, Frank J. Reilly, Charles Webster Hawthorne, Frank Herbert Mason, Ogden Pleissner, Kenneth Hayes Miller, Louis Bouch√©, Eugene Speicher, Helen Winslow Durkee, Arthur Maynard and Rosina Cox Boardman. DuMond developed a Prismatic Palette, used especially for landscapes. His students were taught to see a progression of prismatic light in pre-mixed paints placed in a tonal progression flowing from yellow to violet on the warm side and from yellow to green to blue green to violet on the cool side. A student quoted DuMond, \\"Silently glowing over this whole landscape is a rainbow. You must learn to see it. It is there always.\\" Variations of the Prismatic Palette are still used by many artists and teachers and by schools, including the Ridgewood Art Institute in New Jersey. DuMond was a member of the Old Lyme Art Colony in Old Lyme, Connecticut, where he lived in a neighborhood called Grassy Hill.

Education In most cases, a school or school district will have a leading group of people as a part of central administration. In a school district, these terms may include a Superintendent (education), chief operating officer, school headmaster, and/or other leadership roles in one or more specific department. People on central administration are usually appointed by a board, such as a Board of education. They are comparable to positions such as a Chief executive officer. They rank over all other administration, requiring leadership skills. Central administrative staff have an executive oversight and supervision on school and/or school district administration. The department exists in Universities as well again playing a key role in the organisation of the department. The department is often also tasked with data protection, disaster control planning and other areas. Government Central administration is also a key part of the civil service in many countries; in the United Kingdom, for example, the department supports the chief executive's office and other key areas. In the United States, many arms of government have a central administration department. For instance, in correctional facilities, the office of the director is under its tutelage. It plays a role in the function of various arms of state, such as in India, where it plays a pivotal role in the functioning of the civil service. The department also plays a key role in making critical decisions for many countries; in Pakistan (which borders India), for example, there has been a discussion about whether the government should bring rebellious minded tribal areas under tighter control of central administration. Organizations In many other organizations, a ‚Äúcentral administration‚Äù department plays a key role to its function. In the information technology sector, Central Administration is a key resource, along with development teams. Central administration departments are often tasked with providing IT Support to various organisations, providing key technological support. The nature of the role means the professionals have very high access to PC systems (domain admins, etc.) as they need to undertake functions that include creation and amending of user accounts. Software Central administration can refer both to people within a department as well as consoles, applications, and other tools that help its function. Central administration is part of Windows SharePoint server; it allows system administrators or those within Central admin departments the ability to prioritise various tasks as well as allowing users to view resources and currently running services.

It is regarded as a landmark event in the history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Key participants were Alonzo T. Jones and Ellet J. Waggoner, who presented a message on justification supported by Ellen G. White, but resisted by leaders such as G. I. Butler, Uriah Smith and others. The session discussed crucial theological issues such as the meaning of \\"righteousness by faith\\", the nature of the Godhead, the relationship between law and grace, and Justification and its relationship to Sanctification. Introduction The Seventh-day Adventist Church General Conference Session of 1888 was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It was one of the most significant meetings the denomination had ever had up to that time since it was formally organized on May 23, 1863. Church historians, theologians, and laypersons consider the session to be important. They differ in their own perspective and interpretation of the specific events, the message presented there, and the ensuing reactions. The \\"joint Minneapolis Institute and General Conference, of 1888, involved vastly more than appeared on the surface. It was the culmination of a whole series of developments that led up to it.\\"LeRoy Edwin Froom. Movement of Destiny. Washington DC: Review and Herald, 1971; p. 239. Foundational experience The founding pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church believed in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour and the Bible as their guide in life. Those who had come through the Millerite Movement had first-hand knowledge of disappointment and discouragement. As they studied the Scriptures concerning end time prophecy, the sanctuary types and their fulfillment, and the perpetuity of the law of God, they saw the necessity for organization as a means for proclaiming these truths to the world. The denomination was formally organized on May 23, 1863, in Battle Creek, Michigan. The men and women who were a part of the development of this denomination came from various religious backgrounds, bringing with them into the new movement some beliefs peculiar to their former associations. Two significant hold-over theological views were semi-Pelagianism and semi- Arianism.Erwin Roy Gane. \\"The Arian or Anti-Trinitarian Views Presented in Seventh-day Adventist Literature and the Ellen G. White Answer,\\" 1963. Masters thesis on file at James White Library, Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan. The focus of the early Seventh-day Adventist Church tended more toward basic denominational organization and development, emphasis on obedience to the Ten Commandments, and efforts at evangelism and church growth during the anguish of the American Civil War and its aftermath. After its formation the doctrines of Salvation and righteousness by faith were understood and accepted but stayed in the background, mostly because these truths were familiar to most churches, so bringing out of these and other specific theological points awaited later focus and discussion. Though their Biblical arguments brought many to the church, they had minimized the centrality of the indwelling Christ as the only power to obey the commandments and to keep the Sabbath, and self-satisfaction and complacency began to affect the church. > \\"There was nothing wrong with such material progress. . . .It was right and > proper that institutes be established, that the work spread into new regions > and churches everywhere be raised up. But ministers and laity alike mistook > this growth for the true end and purpose of the Advent movement ‚Äî a > spiritual preparation for the return of Christ. Confusion resulted, and > self-esteem and complacency began to surface in the weekly reports of 'the > advance of the cause' as published in the Review.\\"Robert J. Wieland and > Donald K. Short. 1888 Re-Examined. Uniontown, Ohio: The 1888 Message Study > Committee, 1987; p. 10. Sources of the developing conflict By the second generation of the movement, the denomination had become well established across the United States and had mission fields around the world. As the church grew, so did opposition (and in some places, persecution), particularly regarding the seventh-day Sabbath. Emphasis on the Ten Commandments as a part of obedience to God was a firmly established and central tenet of the denomination by the 1870s. Sunday-keeping Christians claimed that keeping the seventh-day Sabbath was a sign of legalism or judaizing. Convinced of the Biblical correctness of the seventh-day Sabbath, Seventh-day Adventists turned to their Bibles to show the beliefs and doctrines from scripture and teach other Christians, prompting the moniker \\"People of the Book\\" to be applied to them, and not a few became decidedly legalistic.Gerhard Pfandl, \\"Minneapolis, 1888: An Adventist Watershed,\\" Adventist World. Accessed 12-21-10. So at the 1888 General Conference Session in Minneapolis, the presentation of the message of Christ as the only source of righteousness by two young preachers was going to create conflict with some members including church leaders. =Defending Sabbath observance= Ministers and laypersons alike used scriptures in debating the beliefs of Adventist, including this particular issue from Scripture. However, there was still much opposition to the Sabbath belief, and there were Christians that said that Seventh-day Adventists were indeed legalists who held strictly to the \\"letter of the law.\\" All the work involved in developing and extending the denomination seemed to force attention upon what the individual could accomplish, opening the door to self-reliance in spiritual matters as well. The Christ centered gospel was displaced by man's efforts.R. W. Schwarz. Light Bearers to the Remnant. Boise, Idaho: Pacific Press, 1979; p. 184. > \\"Powerful arguments were developed to establish [the law's] 'binding > obligations.' Debaters and polemicists emerged, stressing the Sabbath, the > Law, etc. ‚Äî like lawyers arguing a case. Spirituality waned, and not a few > became decided legalists. . . . Cold intellectualism and dry theory > increased. Christ often became secondary, and Righteousness by Faith largely > lost sight of, through outward profession without inner experience. The > majesty of the message and the law was magnified. But something was lacking. > Discussions were logical and convincing, but not Christ centered.\\" =Arianism and the atonement= A second issue that paved the way for the discussions at Minneapolis was the semi-Arian view on the divinity of Christ. This was not an openly discussed theological perspective but was a view that many of the early church leaders had brought in from the churches they came from and some prominent individuals still held on to them such as Uriah Smith.Firmly eschewing the idea of a creed, the denomination made no attempt at developing a systematic declaration of fundamental beliefs until 1872. A declaration of the nature of the Godhead and Christ as the fully divine Son of God did not appear in public literature until after the epochal session in 1888. After the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference, additions on these subjects were made to the Bible Readings for the Home Circle, published by the Pacific Press. Uriah Smith (1832‚Äì1903), long-time editor of the Review and Herald (now Adventist Review), the official organ of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, had expounded this position in his discourse on the Book of Revelation first published in 1865. Commenting on Revelation 1:4, Smith set forth a straight Arian position by claiming that the language of the verse was \\"applicable only to God the Father,\\" and was \\"never applied to Christ.\\"Uriah Smith. Thoughts on the Revelation. Battle Creek, Michigan: Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association, 3rd edition, 1885; p. 16. Another Adventist pioneer who held to the Arian view was Joseph H. Waggoner (1820‚Äì1889), Ellet J. Waggoner's father. J.H. Waggoner was an early convert to the Advent movement, serving on the committee called in 1860 to form the legal organization of the denomination. In 1881, Joseph H. Waggoner succeeded James White as editor of the Pacific coast evangelistic magazine, Signs of the Times. Through his several books on the atonement, the elder Waggoner wrote that Christ was only God in \\"a subordinate sense,\\" and thus not fully divine. His main point of dispute was the Trinitarian concept of three divine persons (God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit). In his expanded volume on the atonement,Elder J. H. Waggoner. The Atonement; An Examination of a Remedial System in the Light of Nature and Revelation. Oakland, Calif.: Pacific Press, 1884; pp. 146-199. J.H. Waggoner devoted two chapters in his attempt to prove that the Trinitarian view was false because it inferred that Christ, being God, could not have died on the cross of Calvary, and thus full atonement for sin could not have been made. Ellen White wrote very clear passages of the oneness of the GodHead and eventually led the Seventh-day Adventist Church to firmly reject Arianism and accept the concept of the Godhead that the Church holds today on the Trinity. Church historians point out that the teachings and writings of Ellen White, who was raised in a Methodist family, ultimately proved influential in shifting the church away from its largely semi-Arian roots towards Trinitarianism.Jerry A. Moon, The Adventist Trinity Debate Part 1: Historical Overview and The Adventist Trinity Debate Part 2: The Role of Ellen G. White. Copyright 2003 Andrews University Press. See also \\"The Arian or Anti-Trinitarian Views Presented in Seventh-day Adventist Literature and the Ellen G. White Answer\\" by Erwin Roy Gane Open confrontation E.J. Waggoner was selected as a delegate from California to attend the 1886 General Conference session held that year at Battle Creek, Michigan. When he arrived he found that church leaders such as Butler strongly opposed his emphasis on Christ as the sole source of righteousness, especially in light of Waggoner's teaching on the law in Galatians. Butler prepared a small booklet titled \\"The Law in the Book of Galatians\\" that was handed out to all the delegates at that conference, countering Waggoner's position.(Read a PDF of this document online) In this document, Butler presented his position on the law in Galatians, and stated that Waggoner's view would lead the antinomian Christians who opposed Sabbath-keeping to find a reason to claim that the moral law (especially the fourth commandmentRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.) was \\"nailed to the cross\\" and therefore was \\"no longer binding\\" on New Testament Christians.Eld. G. I. Butler. The Law in the Book of Galatians: Is It the Moral Law, or does it refer to that System of Laws Peculiarly Jewish? Review and Herald: Battle Creek, Mich., 1886; p. 7. > \\"The Westerners had reverted to the early Seventh-day Adventist position > that the law Paul here referred to as the 'schoolmaster to bring us to > Christ' (verse 24) was the whole body of the moral law including the Ten > Commandments. This position the Adventists had almost entirely abandoned > during the 1860s and 1870s; the 'schoolmaster' was reinterpreted to mean the > ceremonial and sacrificial laws of Moses which pointed forward to the > Messiah. This reinterpretation had developed largely as a reaction to > Protestant clergymen who interpreted Paul's statement in Galatians 3:25 ('we > are no longer under the schoolmaster') to mean that the Ten Commandment law > had been abrogated; thus, the seventh-day Sabbath was no longer > viable.\\"Schwarz, p. 185. Ellen White initially saw the conflict as a small diversionary topic but quickly realized the danger and that it was counter-productive to the real issue of the fulfillment of Adventist message of Christ's return and moved to resolve the uncomfortable situation. =Summary of the forerunning conflict= Thus we find these two main points of contention facing the delegates at Minneapolis: justification is by faith not by works, and the semi-Arian view of the Godhead and its effect on the doctrine of the atonement. Prior to the 1888 Minneapolis conference a third topic of contention developed between Uriah Smith and A.T. Jones. Jones was an avid student of history, especially as it applied to the prophecies of the Bible. He had discovered that the Alemanni and not the Huns were one of the ten horns (tribes or nations) described prophetically in Daniel 7. Smith took grave exception to this new view, relying on the traditional position of the Millerites to support his position. > \\"Jones was accordingly regarded by some as the fosterer of a new historical > 'heresy,' while Waggoner was thought to be projecting a doctrinal deviation > ‚Äî which departures would have to be settled at the Minneapolis > Meeting.\\"Froom, p. 241. Preconceived opinions and strong prejudice were > firmly entrenched due to the previous two years' contentions between > Waggoner and Butler, and Jones and Smith. Season of debate =Ministerial Bible Institute= Prior to the actual General Conference session, a Bible Institute was convened beginning on Wednesday Oct. 10, 1888. The General Conference session began on Oct. 18 and ran through more than two full weeks, ending on Sunday Nov. 4, 1888. It was during the Bible Institute that A.T. Jones delivered his evidence supporting the idea that the Alemanni were one of the ten horns of prophecy that succeeded the crumbling Roman Empire. \\"Jones had done his homework well. No one was able effectively to dispute the historical evidence he cited in favor of the Alemanni's right to supplant the Huns as one of the kingdoms succeeding Rome. Uriah Smith, Adventism's most noted prophetic expositor, was placed on the defensive. On one occasion he modestly disclaimed originality for the list of kingdoms he had given in Thoughts on Daniel. Smith admitted having simply followed Millerite and earlier interpreters on this point.\\"Schwarz, p. 187. Such strong lines were drawn regarding this subject that during the ensuing weeks of the conference when men would pass each other in the halls, they inquired of each other whether they were \\"Huns\\" or \\"Alemanni.\\" \\"Thus did a dispute over a minor point set the pot of controversy boiling before the really significant theological presentation began.\\"Schwarz, p. 188. \\"Many had come to the Conference expecting a clash, and so were not disappointed. Such entered it in a fighting spirit, and a definite split developed. The gulf was wide and deep.\\"Froom, p. 245. From the onset of the 1888 Minneapolis Conference, Ellen White perceived that a battle over truth was erupting within the denomination. At first, Ellen White rejoiced that the spirit of God was at the meeting and commented that the leaders \\"heard as it were God speaking to them through his Son. They saw, they felt the divine influence of the Spirit of God and all witnessed to the gracious words that proceeded from His mouth [Ellen White, Manuscript 24, 1888.].\\" Ellen White soon discovered, however, that other forces were deliberately at work planning to disrupt and confuse the mission and message of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Ellen White was convinced that God had \\"raised up\\" for this moment these two young ministers, E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones, to give a message to the delegates at the conference.\\"I believe without a doubt that God has given precious truth at the right time to Brother Jones and Brother Waggoner. Do I place them as infallible? Do I say that they will not make a statement or have an idea that cannot be questioned or that cannot be error? Do I say so? No, I do not say any such thing. Nor do I say that of any man in the world. But I do say God has sent light, and do be careful how you treat it.\\"Ellen G. White 1888 Materials, 566. =General Conference session= When E.J. Waggoner arrived at the Conference, a blackboard had been placed on the speaker's platform with views on the law in Galatians written upon it. J.H. Morrison had affixed his signature under the statement: \\"Resolved ‚Äî That the Law in Galatians Is the Ceremonial Law.\\" Waggoner was invited to place his signature under the opposing proposition: \\"Resolved ‚Äî That the Law in Galatians Is the Moral Law.\\" Waggoner declined, saying that he had not come to the meetings to debate, but to present truth as it is found in Scripture. Waggoner began to present what he had discovered from the Bible on the subject of Christ and His righteousness. \\"The preaching of the younger men (Waggoner was 33, Jones was 38) was trying to the older leaders. Their vigorous preaching somehow seemed to have a note of authority that was resented.\\"Froom, p. 246. Supported in their resistance by letters of encouragement from G.I. Butler to \\"stand by the old landmarks\\" these older men resisted what was being presented.A prostrating fever of some variety (some historians claim it was malaria, others report that it was typhoid) and nervous exhaustion prevented Butler from attending the 1888 General Conference. But from his sickbed, he was in constant communication with his chief cohorts, Uriah Smith and J.H. Morrison, who were at the conference. His decided position was \\"stand by the old landmarks\\" on the traditional view on the prophecy of Daniel, and on the law in Galatians. J. H. Morrison was selected to offer the rebuttal to Waggoner's presentations. He spoke sincerely and earnestly expressing the fear that Waggoner's view, if adopted, would direct attention away from the Adventist position of explicit obedience to all the commandments of God. When it was again Waggoner's turn at the pulpit, he and A.T. Jones offered a unique reply. Standing before the assembly they opened their Bibles and without personal comment alternately read sixteen passages bearing on the subject at hand.Waggoner opened the rejoinder by reading Jer. 23:5-7; Jones followed reading Eph. 2:4-8. Continuing to alternate, they went through the following verses ‚Äî Waggoner: Gal. 2:16-21, Rom. 1:14-17, Gal 3 (entire chapter), Gal. 5:16, Gal. 2 (entire), Rom. 5 (entire), Rom. 8:14-39. Jones's verses were: Rom. 11:1-33, Rom. 2:13-29, Rom. 3 (entire), Rom. 9:7-33, Rom. 4:1-11, Rom. 1:15-17, 1 John 5:14. Notwithstanding Ellen White's considerable influence to assist Waggoner and Jones, the debate over the law in Galatians soon became heated. Even Ellen White could not stay the negative tide that had enveloped the Conference, and she concluded, \\"it is evident that a delusion was upon our brethren.\\" Although she supported and protected Waggoner and Jones as much as possible, Ellen White realized that their theological positions were being resisted by the church's leaders. Most Precious Message The claim was that Waggoner's \\"new light\\" was nothing more than what Adventists had always presented on justification by faith, which was theoretically true as Adventist taught that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ, but the emphasis had tended to be more on works and on sanctification. Placing righteousness by faith squarely on the foundation of Christ and His righteousness, and Christ's work as our High Priest during the antitypical Day of Atonement brought a fresh perspective to the doctrine as it had previously been preached from Adventist pulpits. Ellen White saw the importance of the 1888 message Jones and Waggoner brought and why it was needed for the members can be seen in her comments on the message of righteousness by faith. \\"Many had lost sight of Jesus. They needed to have their eyes directed to His divine person, His merits, and His changeless love for the human family. All power is given into His hands, that He may dispense rich gifts unto men, imparting the priceless gift of His own righteousness to the helpless human agent.\\" Testimonies to Ministers, 92. \\"The uplifted Saviour is to appear in His efficacious work as the Lamb slain, sitting upon the throne, to dispense the priceless covenant blessings, the benefits He died to purchase for every soul who should believe on Him. John could not express that love in words; it was too deep, too broad; he calls upon the human family to behold it. Christ is pleading for the church in the heavenly courts above, pleading for those for whom He paid the redemption price of His own lifeblood. Centuries, ages, can never diminish the efficacy of this atoning sacrifice. The message of the gospel of His grace was to be given to the church in clear and distinct lines, that the world should no longer say that Seventh-day Adventists talk the law, the law, but do not teach or believe Christ.\\" Ibid. \\"If Christ is all and in all to every one of us, why are not His incarnation and His atoning sacrifice dwelt upon more in the churches?\\" Selected Messages, vol. 3, 187. The preachers had proclaimed with a \\"loud voice\\" the claims of the law of God, but barely an \\"inaudible whisper\\" was heard of the faith of Jesus: \\"The faith of Jesus has been overlooked and treated in an indifferent, careless manner. It has not occupied the prominent position in which it was revealed to John. Faith in Christ as the sinner's only hope has been largely left out, not only of the discourses given but of the religious experience of very many who claimed to believe the third angel's message.\\" Ibid., 168. Thus, the Seventh-day Adventist message was in danger of becoming a lifeless, Christless message with Legalism as its focus rather than Christ \\"A legal religion has been thought quite the correct religion for this time. But it is a mistake. The rebuke of Christ to the Pharisees is applicable to those who have lost from the heart their first love. A cold, legal religion can never lead souls to Christ; for it is a loveless, Christless religion.\\" Ibid., vol. l, 388. =Refutation of Arianism= Waggoner centered his logical proof on the fact that Christ possesses \\"all the fullness of the Godhead\\" being \\"by nature the very substance of God, and having life in Himself, He is properly called Jehovah, the self-existent One.\\"E.J. Waggoner. Christ and His Righteousness. Melbourne, Aust.: Echo Publishing, 1892; p. 23. This is a truth no Arian would ever admit. However, it is also true that Waggoner would never have utilized the term Arian in a pejorative manner. While he rejected the idea that Christ was a created being, he still maintained: \\"There was a time when Christ proceeded forth and came from God, from the bosom of the Father (John 8:42; 1:18), but that time was so far back in the days of eternity that to finite comprehension it is practically without beginning.\\"Waggoner, p. 21-22 The nature and relationship of the Godhead, let alone the divinity of Christ, is too complex for human comprehension. Nonetheless, Waggoner's entire discussion on Christ and His righteousness was linked to the divinity of Christ. For Waggoner, the equality of Christ with God magnifies his condescension and humility in assuming humanity. In fact, Waggoner wrote: \\"Let no one, therefore, who honors Christ at all, give Him less honor than he gives the Father, for this would be to dishonor the Father by just so much; but let all, with the angels in heaven worship the Son, having no fear that they are worshiping and serving the creature instead of the Creator.\\"Waggoner, p. 24 The everlasting covenant promise God made to fallen Adam in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:15) was that Emmanuel‚ÄîGod with us‚Äîwould \\"save His people from their sin\\" (Matt. 1:21). Jesus fulfilled this promise in every aspect. > \\"Think of it; God swore by Himself! That is, He pledged Himself, and His own > existence, to our salvation in Jesus Christ. He put Himself in pawn.

Such an expanded concept on the length and breadth of the atonement had never been heard before from any pulpit. Ellen White declared it to be \\"a most precious message,\\" a message that \\"was to bring more prominently before the world the uplifted Saviour, the sacrifice for the sins of the whole world. It presented justification through faith in the Surety; it invited the people to receive the righteousness of Christ, which is made manifest in obedience to all the commandments of God.\\"Ellen G. White. Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers. Mountain View, Calif.: Pacific Press, 1962; pp. 91-92. =Foundation for Righteousness by Faith= Far from promoting antinomian sentiments, Waggoner's message presented Christ in all His glory as the Saviour of all mankind, it brought balance between Justification and Sanctification. When properly understood through a heart appreciation of what it cost the Godhead to redeem fallen man from sin, this truth results in a heart surrender to the will of God, producing faithful obedience to all the commandments of God. > \\"'Do you mean to teach universal salvation?' someone may ask.

The Glad Tidings ‚Äî Galatians Made Clear. > Paris, Ohio: Glad Tidings Publishers, 1972; p. 13-14. This was the message of Christ and His righteousness presented by E.J. Waggoner and A.T. Jones at the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference. Due to the conflict, Jones and Waggoner's presentations were coolly received or outrightly rejected by many of the leaders of the denomination, notwithstanding Ellen Whites words that it was the \\"old light\\",Selected Messages, book 3, p. 168 something that she had been preaching for decades. Even so, these two men were invited to preach at subsequent camp meetings, worker's meetings, and ministerial institutes over the next several years. E.J. Waggoner wrote extensively on the subject of Christ and His righteousness, developing the stenographic notes made by his wife during the 1888 conference into a book with that title. A.T. Jones would be a principal speaker at the next several General Conference sessions, and would write an exposition on the work of Christ as our High Priest relating to the perfection of Christian character, titled Consecrated Way to Christian Perfection (1901). Ellen White supported Waggoner's and Jones' Christ centered view on justification by faith and their refutation of Arianism, and later wrote that she had been teaching for \\"forty-five years\\" this same message as Jones and Waggoner had presented it at that sessionManuscript Releases, vol. 1, p. 142 Eight years later, in 1896, Ellen White wrote, \\"In this scripture [Gal. 3:24], the Holy Spirit through the apostle is speaking especially of the moral law. The law reveals sin to us, and causes us to feel our need of Christ and to flee to Him for pardon and peace.\\"Selected Messages, vol. 1, p. 234. Although no manuscripts of the exact words from the 1888 conference are known to exist or preserved, save Ellen White's comments, in E.J. Waggoner's book, Christ and His Righteousness, we are given a glimpse into what might have been said. These chapters (series of articles) are the first writings of Waggoner on the subject written in the early part of 1889 just weeks after the 1888 general conference session. The focus in this book, as well as other later books like, The Gospel in Creation, contain the building blocks with a definition of a true righteousness by faith theology and experience. Namely the Holy Spirit's use of Power of the Word of God in the believer. Meaning that because the Word has innate power by virtue of its supernatural origination and through the Holy Spirit's ability to use it, forms Christ within the believer. Therefore, His righteousness internally replaces our internal unrighteousness. This concept has been lost sight of through the years in Adventist circles. Since 1986, certain members in good standing of the church, have written their own books defining the tenets of what they believe Jones and Waggoner taught as the 1888 message. One tenet of belief heavily stressed by Robert Wieland and others was \\"Universal Justification\\". While this subject is worthy of study and discussion, it was not the foundation of Waggoner or Jones teaching. Both men's books taught the concept of The Power of the Word as the central key, which ironically is absent from all books written in the last 50 years that attempt to define what the 1888 message is. Reading primary sources will be the only way to unlock this mystery, with an answer as to why Ellen White regarded E.J. Waggoner and A.T. Jones\\"s sermons, at the 1888 general conference, as the beginning of the Latter Rain.

The inventor of the Ras Lila dance, with his daughter Shija Lailoibi playing as Radha at the first performance, he is a legendary figure in Manipur, and much of his actions as King had been mythologized. He is also credited with spreading Vaishnavism in Manipur State after his grandfather Pamheiba made Hinduism the official religion and for creating a unified Manipur. Early years Maharaja Bhagya Chandra ascended to the throne of Manipur in 1759, a few years after the death of his grandfather Pamheiba and his father Samjai Khurai-Lakpa at the hands of his uncle Chitsai. In 1762, Manipur was attacked by the Burmese, assisted by the Chitsai. He, along with the Rani and a few loyal attendants fled to Ahom (modern-day Assam), where they lived under the protection of the Ahom ruler, Rajeswar Singha. =Life in Assam= Bhagya Chandra's crafty uncle wrote a letter to the Ahom king Rajeswar Singha saying that the person taking refuge at his court was not the true Bhagya Chandra. The uncle advised Rajeswar Singha to get rid of him. King Rajeswar Singha was somewhat persuaded by this letter and began treating Bhagya Chandra with suspicion. In Meitei legends, the real Bhagya Chandra was said to have supernatural powers. To see whether the usurper was correct, King Rajeswar Singha designed a test at the behest of his court. In a public arena, Bhagya Chandra, while unarmed, was to catch and tame a wild elephant. =First epiphany= Confronted with insurmountable odds, King Bhagyachandra prayed to Lord Govinda (Krishna) for guidance. Govinda appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to enter the arena donning a garland while holding japa beads. At the end of the instructions, Govinda assured him of victory. The dream also stated that Bhagya Chandra would be the sole king of Manipur. Upon regaining the kingdom, he should install a Krishna murti. The Deity, Govinda, should be carved from a certain old jackfruit tree growing on the slopes of Kaina hill. After installing the Deity, Govinda said the king should arrange for the performance of a Rasa- Lila, in which Krishna would be worshipped with song and dance. Bhagya Chandra also received in this vision a complete plan on how to execute the Ras Lila. =The test of power= Bhagya Chandra entered the arena, donning the garland and japa he was instructed to in the vision. In the ensuing fight, the spectators noted that the elephant seemed to recoil as if struck by a ghost. King Bhagya Chandra said that he saw \\"Lord Krishna as the mahout\\". The retaking of Manipur =First expedition= After the duel, Bhagya Chandra appealed to Ahom king Rajeswar Singha for military assistance. Rajeswar Singha agreed to send an army to overthrow Chitsai and reinstate Bhagya Chandra. The expedition hit many snags in Nagaland where they were attacked by Naga tribesmen and poisonous snakes. Rajeswar Singha called off the unsuccessful venture in 1767. =Second expedition= In November 1768, Bhagya Chandra and Rajeswar Singha decided to make another attempt to invade Manipur. This time Bhagya Chandra led 10,000 Ahom troops across the Kachari kingdom to the Mirap river. Many battles ensued between the Ahoms and Meiteis on one side, and the Naga, Chitsai and the Burmese on the other. In 1773, Bhagya Chandra was reinstated as Ningthou of Manipur Dealings with the East India Company In 1762, the British and Manipur signed a bilateral treaty with Gaurisiam, which spelled that the British and Meiteis would encourage trade and commerce. The British gave necessary help for protection against the Burmese and Naga. Manipur gave up a village for an East India Company post. The name \\"Manipur\\" (assigned by the British for Ching-Thang's kingdom) for what was called \\"Meitrabak\\" came into being in 1774 when the Governor General of India Mr. Rendel, surveyed the area westward from Ningthi to Cachar and Northward from Chittagong to the Brahmaputra and renamed it. Reign Monument of Bheigyachandra Maharaj In 1775 he established his capital at Bishenpur and carved the Govinda murti at the hill of Kaina. On 11 January 1779 he was \\"re- crowned\\" amid many performances of his now-popular Rasa Lila. During his reign, the Meiteis repelled the Burmese from Manipur. Though his exploits, did not equal Pamheiba's, his reign was characterized by security. He was a great patron of the arts and religion, and his strong Vaishnavism reflected on the Meiteis. He was an ardent devotee of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and during his reign a statue of Nityananda was created. In 1796 he moved his capital to Kangla and a year later on 5 February 1798 he abdicated the throne to his eldest son Labeinyachandra. His last few years were on pilgrimage top various Vaisnavit holy sites, including Nabadwip. He died on 25 December 1798 in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Family Ching-Thang Khomba was son to Samjai Khurai-Lakpa, who had two brothers Mantri Ananda Shai and Chitsai. Ching-Thang had many siblings, the most famous of whom was Gaurisiam, King of Manipur until his death in 1763. Cultural works The tradition of Rasa Lila in Manipur is attributed to Ching-Thang. The first Manipur Maha Rasleela was performed in 1777. It was his daughter Shija Lailoibi, who first took the role of Radha in the Manipuri dance .Under the influence of Bengali missionaries, he also started the tradition of Sankirtan in Manipur. =Literary works= *Laithok Laikha Jogi References Category:1748 births Category:1799 deaths Category:Meitei royals Category:Gaudiya religious leaders Category:Hindu monarchs ","title":"Ching-Thang Khomba"},{"id":"8040490","text":"Gaurisiam or Guru Sham () () (18th century CE - 1763) was a Manipuri King who ruled between 1756 and 1763.Manipur Princely State - (11 gun salute) He was the brother of Ching-Thang Khomba, King of Manipur.

The stems are typically simple or branching in the lower half of plant, and they are erect, generally flexible, and of green to reddish color. Pentachaeta leaves are normally narrowly linear, ciliate and green. The terminal inflorescences are solitary with heads radiate, disciform or discoid; peduncles manifest as wispy with bell-shaped involucres measuring three to seven millimeters. This genus has green phyllaries in two to three generally equal series, lanceolate to obovate, with margins widely scarious, and a naked receptacle. The white, yellow or red corolla may be simplified to a tube. The disk shaped flowers manifest linear, acute style tips.

His association with the Padres dates back to 1980.MLB biog of Leitner Background Leitner was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx, and at age 8 moved with his family to the adjacent city of Yonkers, New York, in Westchester County. He played football for Roosevelt High School in Yonkers. After high school he attended and graduated from Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and then completed a master's degree at Oklahoma University in Norman, Oklahoma. Before starting his long tenure in San Diego in 1980, Leitner worked as a television sportscaster at WFSB in Hartford, Connecticut, and at WCAU-TV in Philadelphia. He has previously been a broadcaster for the Philadelphia Eagles, the San Diego Clippers and the San Diego Chargers, and with university sports in Oklahoma, Hartford, and San Diego. He has six sons and one daughter. He has been divorced four times. On May 29, 2018 he announced via Twitter that he had been diagnosed with cancer and would be leaving the Padres broadcasts indefinitely. On June 15 he announced via Twitter that his cancer scare was a benign tumor, and on June 29 he announced that he would return to Padres broadcasting. Sports commentary Leitner is currently the commentator for San Diego Padres baseball, San Diego State Aztecs football, and San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball. He is known for his outspoken style, and for referring to the team as \\"My Padres\\" when they are winning and/or playing well. When the team is losing or in a bad stretch, he refers to the team as \\"Your Padres.\\" For years, Leitner did television on the Padres' cable TV network, as well as doing the 5 and 11 pm sportscasts for KFMB-TV. His home run call is \\"ball going, ball gone!\\" Leitner has a history of mocking those who like NHL hockey, and those who complain to the station that he does not show highlights. To \\"appease\\" hockey fans, Ted would occasionally show a highlight clip of an NHL game, typically two enforcers squared off in a fight. If only one NHL game was being played on a given night, Leitner would claim that he was about to show every goal scored. The 3 or 4 goals would then be shown in rapidly edited fashion. In 2015 he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. Political commentary Leitner has also dabbled in news and political commentary during his career and once did a news-oriented talk show for KFMB radio. One of his most notable programs was when the guest was entertainer and outspoken Bush administration critic Harry Belafonte. On the 20-minute segment, Belafonte would condemn the entire Bush administration, especially then Secretary of State Colin Powell as well as Attorney General John Ashcroft.

It is included in both the state and federal lists of endangered species. It is endemic to the San Francisco Bay Area of California, United States, and occurs only at altitudes less than . P. bellidiflora is found chiefly on rocky, grassy areas. The conservation status of this species was, as of 1999, characterized by a declining population, with a severely diminished and fragmented range. The specific bellidiflora refers to the similarity of the flowers with those of common daisies (Bellis). Description Pentachaeta bellidiflora is a small annual wildflower growing from a slender taproot, which, although it appears smooth, is actually covered by fine hairs. The sparsely hairy stems may number between in length and are typically simple, or branching in the lower half of plant. They are erect, generally flexible, and of green to reddish color. White-rayed Pentachaeta leaves are normally narrowly linear, ciliate (fringed with hair) and green, measuring less than long and one millimeter wide. Upper and lower leaf surfaces are smooth.P. bellidiflora, in Jepson Manual, University of California Press (1993) The terminal inflorescences number four or five solitary, roughly circular heads per plant. Peduncles are wispy, with bell-shaped involucres measuring 3 to 7 millimeters, and they range from glabrous to short-haired. Like all of its genus, P. bellidiflora has green phyllaries in two to three generally equal series, lanceolate to obovate, with margins widely scarious (dry and membranous), and a naked receptacle. The yellow corollas are five-lobed, and each of the 16 to 38 disk shaped florets (per head) has linear, acute style tips. They may be slightly red-tinged underneath. Fruits are 1.5 to 3.0 millimeters in diameter and are generally compressed in an oblong to fusiform shape; they are typically covered with small hairs. The plant presents fragile pappuses with five or fewer slender bristles, slightly expanded at the base. Flowering season ranges from late March until late June. From a chromosomal standpoint, the species is diploid, (contains one set of chromosomes from each parent), and has 2n=18. Distribution and habitat White-rayed pentachaeta is found in serpentine grassland as well as valley and foothill grassland. It is currently known only to survive in serpentine bunchgrass communities and native prairies in two small areas of San Mateo County, including populations in Edgewood County Park and on San Francisco Water District lands at serpentine outcrops on the eastern slopes of Crystal Springs Reservoir, in the vicinity of State Route 92.Earth Metrics Inc., Report of endangered species search and vegetative survey of the Polhemus Property at the northeast corner of the intersection of Ralston Avenue and State Route 92, San Mateo, prepared for San Mateo County, California, July 1989 It was formerly known to occur from Marin to Santa Cruz counties. One study Fall Meeting Supplement, abstract #B31B-03, accessed 2006-11-23 declares only one population remains. Prior range is defined by the following USGS maps: Soquel (387B)* 3612188, Santa Cruz (387E) 3612281, Castle Rock Ridge (408A)* 3712221, Big Basin (408B)* 3712222, Davenport (408C)* 3712212, Felton (408D)* 3712211, Woodside (429A) 3712243, San Francisco South (448B)* 3712264, Montara Mountain (448C)* 3712254, San Mateo (448D)* 3712253, San Quentin (466B)* 3712284, San Rafael (467A)* 3712285, Point Bonita (467D)*. Conservation As of the declaration of Federal endangerment status, the finding of the United States Environmental Protection Agency was that the total species population was sufficiently small and fragmented that it was subject to stochastic extinction.Federal Register: February 3, 1995, Volume 60, Number 23 Recent habitat destruction by urban development, off road vehicle use and actions of highway maintenance crews have been responsible for the severe reduction in range and viability of this species. Population sizes vary from year to year depending on local rainfall and competition from invasive plants. In 1997, P. bellidiflora was the subject of a recovery workshop conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game, where the need for permanently protecting and managing the existing populations, and reintroduction strategies for populations into suitable protected habitat were analyzed. Management and recovery actions for the species have been addressed in the United States Federal Recovery Plan for Serpentine Soil Species of the San Francisco Bay Area, finalized in 1998.The Status of Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Animals and Plants of California, White-rayed pentachaeta, California Department of Fish and Game Habitat Conservation Planning Branch, 2000 See also *San Mateo thorn-mint References External links *U.S. Federal Listing Details for Pentachaeta bellidiflora Category:Endemic flora of California Category:Astereae Category:Critically endangered plants Category:Natural history of San Mateo County, California Category:Endemic flora of the San Francisco Bay Area ","title":"Pentachaeta bellidiflora"},{"id":"8040759","text":"Mark Nohra (born October 23, 1973 in Beirut, Lebanon) is a former running back and fullback with the Canadian Football League's B.C.

Newman argues that architectural and environmental design plays a crucial part in increasing or reducing criminality. The theory developed in the early 1970s, and he wrote his first book on the topic, Defensible Space in 1972. The book contains a study from New York that pointed out that higher crime rate existed in high-rise housing projects than in low-rise complexes. This, he concluded, was because residents felt no control or personal responsibility for an area occupied by so many people. Throughout his study, Newman focused on explaining his ideas on social control, crime prevention, and public health in relation to community design.  Theory  As defined in Newman's book Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space, defensible space is \\"a residential environment whose physical characteristics‚Äîbuilding layout and site plan‚Äîfunction to allow inhabitants themselves to become key agents in ensuring their security.\\" He goes on to explain that a housing development is only defensible if residents intend to adopt this role, which is defined by good design: \\"Defensible space therefore is a sociophysical phenomenon,\\" says Newman. Both society and physical elements are parts of a successful defensible space. The theory argues that an area is safer when people feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for that piece of a community. Newman asserts that \\"the criminal is isolated because his turf is removed\\" when each space in an area is owned and cared for by a responsible party. If an intruder can sense a watchful community, he feels less secure committing his crime. The idea is that crime and delinquency can be controlled and mitigated through environmental design. There are five factors that make a defensible space: #Territoriality ‚Äì the idea that one's home is sacred #Natural surveillance ‚Äì the link between an area's physical characteristics and the residents' ability to see what is happening #Image ‚Äì the capacity of the physical design to impart a sense of security #Milieu ‚Äì other features that may affect security, such as proximity to a police substation or busy commercial area #Safe Adjoining Areas - for better security, residents obtain higher ability of surveillance of adjoining area through designing the adjoining area The concept of defensible space is controversial. A United States Department of Justice experiment in Hartford, Connecticut closed streets and assigned police teams to certain neighborhoods. New public housing projects were designed around ideas of limited access to the city, but Hartford did not show any dramatic drop in crime. Yet, the private places of St. Louis do have much lower crime than public streets. The reason appears to be that in St. Louis, people had the capacity and incentives to defend their defensible spaces. Residents had the right to ask an unwelcome individual (i.e. not a resident or guest) to leave their street, because they jointly owned it. On public streets, one cannot legally act against someone until they have committed a crime.  Intention  The intention of physical features is to create a sense of territorialism in community members which will ensure a safe living environment for those that care for it. Defensible space works with a hierarchy of living and community spaces. According to the theory, housing developments that evoke territorialism are ‚Äúthe strongest deterrents to criminal and vandal activity.‚Äù Housing should be grouped in such a way that members feel a mutual benefit. Also to deter crime, areas should be defined for function, paths should be defined for movement, outdoor areas should be juxtaposed with homes, and indoor spaces should visually provide for close watch of outside areas. Newman holds that through good design, people should not only feel comfortable questioning what is happening in their surroundings, but they should feel obligated to do so. Any intruder should be able to sense the existence of a watchful community and avoid the situation altogether. Criminals fear the likelihood that a resident, upon viewing the intrusion, would then question their actions. This is highly effective in neighborhoods that cannot afford a professional crime watch. The defensible space theory is applicable to any type of planned space. From low density housing to high rises, the key is the development of a communal area in which residents can ‚Äúextend the realm of their homes and the zone of felt responsibility.‚Äù Circulation paths and common entry are important aspects of defensible design as well. Residents must also feel a need to extend their protective attitudes to locations where property and urban streets and surroundings connect. The interfacing between private property and community space should be protected similarly. Newman‚Äôs intent in creating the principles of defensible space is to give the residents of a community control of public spaces that they formerly felt were out of reach. In effect, residents care enough for their area to protect it from crime as they would protect their own private property. = Principles = Oscar Newman‚Äôs basic five principles of designing defensible space as quoted in Design Guidelines for Creating Defensible Space are as follows: #The assignment to different resident groups the specific environments they are best able to utilize and control, as determined by their ages, life-styles, socializing proclivities, backgrounds, incomes, and family structures. #The territorial definition of space in residential developments to reflect the zone of influence of specific inhabitants. Residential environments should be subdivided into zones toward which adjacent residents can easily adopt proprietary attitudes. #The juxtaposition of dwelling interiors with exterior spaces and the placement of windows to allow residents to naturally survey the exterior and interior public areas of their living environments and the areas assigned for their use. #The juxtaposition of dwellings‚Äîtheir entries and amenities‚Äîwith city streets so as to incorporate the streets within the sphere of influence of the residential environment. #The adoption of building forms and idioms that avoids the stigma of peculiarity that allows others to perceive the vulnerability and isolation of a particular group of inhabitants. To create a defensible space community, residential areas should be subdivided into smaller entities of similar families because control is enhanced. Responsibility for the area is more easily assumed in a smaller group of families as opposed to a larger community. Smaller groups more frequently use an area geared toward them. The number of activities in the space is increased; thus, a feeling of ownership and a need to protect the property follows. On the other hand, when larger groups use a community space, no one has control over the area, and an agreement over its acceptable uses is often in dispute. = Housing Types = In Newman's 1980 book, Community of Interest, he provided recommended housing types for different family types. He recommended families with children to live in single-family homes and walk-up apartments. However, mid-rise buildings with a doorman is okay if it is a smaller family. He recommended the elderly live in mid-rise and high-rise buildings with a doorman and sometimes these buildings without a doorman would suffice. Lastly, since working adults often treat housing as a hotel guest, mid-rise and high-rise buildings with a doorman is highly recommended.  Today  The defensible space theory was largely popular in city design from its emergence until the 1980s. Some of his basic ideas are still taken into consideration presently, and all contemporary approaches and discussions of the relationship between crime and house design use Newman's theory as a critical point of reference.Reynald, D.M. and Elffers, H., 2009. The future of Newman's Defensible Space Theory: Linking Defensible Space and the routine activities of place. European Journal of Criminology, 6(1), pp.25-46. Although modifications were made to the original theory in the 1980s, Newman's basic principles still exist in design, and have been used by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development as \\"both a criminological concept and a proven strategy for enhancing our Nation's quality of life\\".  In popular culture  In the HBO miniseries Show Me a Hero, Newman, a recurring character, articulates his theory of defensible space to Judge Sand as they are trying to plan where to place two hundred new units of desegregated public housing in the city of Yonkers, New York.

The book generated greater acceptance of the Adventist church within the evangelical community, where it had previously been widely regarded as a cult. However, it also proved to be one of the most controversial publications in Adventist historyGeorge Knight in the annotated edition describes the original as \\"the most divisive book in Seventh-day Adventist history\\", p.xiii and the release of the book brought prolonged alienation and separation within Adventism and evangelicalism. Although no authors are listed on the title of the book (credit is given to \\"a representative group\\" of Adventist \\"leaders, Bible teachers and editors\\"), the primary contributors to the book were Le Roy Edwin Froom, Walter E. Read, and Roy Allan Anderson (sometimes referred to as \\"FREDA\\"). In Adventist culture, the phrase Questions on Doctrine has come to encompass not only the book itself but also the history leading up to its publication and the prolonged theological controversy which it sparked. This article covers all of these facets of the book's history and legacy. History =Background= The publication of Questions on Doctrine grew out of a series of conferences between a few Adventist spokespersons and Protestant representatives from 1955 to 1956. The roots of this conference originated in a series of dialogues between Pennsylvania conference president, T. E. Unruh, and evangelical Bible teacher and magazine editor Donald Grey Barnhouse. Unruh was particularly concerned because of a scathing review written by Barnhouse about Ellen White's book, Steps to Christ. Unruh had sent him a copy of the book in 1949. In the spring of 1955 Barnhouse commissioned Walter Martin to write a book about Seventh-day Adventists. Martin requested a meeting with Adventist leaders so that he could question them about their beliefs. The first meeting between Martin and Adventist leaders occurred in March 1955. Martin was accompanied by George Cannon and met with Adventist representatives Le Roy Edwin Froom and W. E. Read. Later Roy Allan Anderson and Barnhouse joined these discussions. Initially both sides viewed each other with suspicion as they worked through a list of 40 questions. Central to these concerns were four alleged items of Adventist theology: (1) the atonement was not completed at the cross; (2) salvation is the result of grace plus the works of the law; (3) Jesus was a created being, not from all eternity; and (4) that Jesus partook of man's sinful, fallen nature at the incarnation. By the summer of 1956 the small group of evangelicals became convinced that Seventh-day Adventists were sufficiently orthodox to be considered Christian. Barnhouse published his conclusions in the September 1956 issue of Eternity magazine in the article, \\"Are Seventh-day Adventists Christians?\\"Donald Grey Barnhouse, \\"Are Seventh-day Adventists Christians?\\" Eternity, September 1956, 7. In it, they concluded, \\"Seventh-day Adventists are a truly Christian group, rather than an anti-Christian cult.\\"as quoted by Loren Dickinson This greatly surprised its readers, and 6,000 canceled their subscriptions in protest.Richard Schwarz, Light Bearers to the Remnant (Boise, Idaho: Pacific Press, 1979), 544; as quoted by Dickinson Following this announcement, Adventists were gradually invited to participate in Billy Graham's crusades.Dickinson =Conflict within Adventism= In Barnhouse's article it was stated that most Adventists believed in the sinless human nature of Christ and those who did not were part of the \\"lunatic fringe.\\" M. L. Andreasen, a conservative Adventist theologian, took exception to this statement. Further debate broke out between Andreasen and Froom in February 1957 after Froom published an article on the atonement in Ministry magazine. In this article Froom argued that the atonement was a \\"full and complete sacrifice.\\"Knight 2003, p .xviii He furthermore asserted that \\"the sacrificial act on the cross [is] a complete, perfect, and final atonement for man's sins.\\" Froom's articulation of the atonement still held to the Adventist belief in Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary going into the Holy of Holies to begin a final atonement for humanity. Venden points out that the atonement must have been complete at the cross‚Äîthe sacrifice was sufficient. When Jesus died for man's sin it was enough to purchase man's salvation and man cannot add anything to it. Yet, the atonement involves more that just sacrifice. The process of redemption, the restoration of man's broken relationship to at-one-ment with God, was not completed at the cross, else there would be no more sin or sickness or pain or sorrow or separation or battered children or hospitals or funeral trains or tombstones or broken hearts. It is the winning of men back to a love relationship with God that is not yet completed. Andreasen articulated a three-phase understanding of the atonement. In the first phase Christ lived a perfect life despite having a fallen nature. During the second phase the death of Christ on the cross occurred. And finally, during the third phase (the focal point of his theology), Christ demonstrates that man can do what He did. Satan was not defeated at the cross but would be defeated by the \\"last generation\\" in its demonstration that an entire generation of people could live a sinlessly perfect life.M. L. Andreasen, The Sanctuary Service, chapter entitled \\"The Last Generation\\" Questions on Doctrine intensified the tensions over these issues because it brought more weight to the death of Jesus as a complete work of atonement and that though Jesus possessed Adam‚Äôs physical human nature after the fall, he did not inherit Adam's fallen spiritual nature. \\"When Adam Came from the Creator's hand, he bore, in his physical, mental and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker‚ÄîGod created man in His own image.\\"White, E., 1903, Education, p. 15 As a consequence, Andreasen embarked on a campaign against QOD. He published a series of responses to Froom in 9 papers written in 1957/1958 and in a series of booklets entitled Letters to the Churches (1959). On April 6, 1961, Andreasen's ministerial credentials were suspended by the church because of his ongoing public protests against church leadership. But a few months later on March 1, 1962, after Andreasen died on Feb. 19, 1962, the General Conference executive committee revoked its earlier decision on his ministerial credentials.Knight 2003, p .xxv =Evangelicals Divided Over Questions on Doctrine= In 1960, Walter Martin published his own response to Questions on Doctrine, entitled The Truth About Seventh-day Adventism,Walter Martin, The Truth about Seventh Adventists (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 1960) which had wide circulation.Questions on Doctrine Annotated, Republished by Mark Kellner. Adventist Review The book carried with it a disclaimer that only those Adventists whose theology agreed with Questions on Doctrine were true members of the body of Christ. From June 1960 till July 1961 Adventist magazine Ministry published a long series of responses to Martin's book, which are available online.Articles from Ministry (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald), .

Schuyler English, and Frank Mead. Many conservative Evangelicals disagreed with Martin and Barnhouse's positive assessment of Adventism. The leaders of this view included a large amount of Reformed writers. Differences associated with the Calvinist-Arminian dispute were a major part in the debate (Adventism is soteriologically Arminian), but Martin did not regard conformity to Calvinism as a test of Christian orthodoxy. In 1962 Norman F. Douty published Another Look at Seventh-day Adventism and Herbert Bird, Theology of Seventh-day Adventism, both of which argued that Adventists were still a cult. Dutch Calvinist theologian Anthony Hoekema grouped Adventism together with Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses and Christian Science in his 1963 publication The Four Major Cults. In this book Hoekema praises Adventists for moving away from Arianism, but argues that Questions on Doctrine failed to truly repudiate the doctrine of Christ's sinful nature, and similarly failed to remove ambiguities and inconsistencies regarding the atonement. =Legacy= Questions on Doctrine has proven to be divisive for many Adventists in the latter half of the twentieth century. Church historian George R. Knight has written that \\"Official Adventism may have gained recognition as being Christian from the evangelical world, but in the process a breach had been opened which has not healed in the last 50 years and may never heal.\\" Conservative Herbert Douglass agreed, \\"most, if not all, of the so-called 'dissident' or 'independent' groups of the last 45 years are direct results of the explicit and implicit positions espoused by [Questions on Doctrine] on the atonement and the Incarnation.\\"as quoted on http://qod.andrews.edu/index.html Around 138,000 to 147,000 copies of QOD were circulated, but the book was so controversial that it was placed out of print in 1963. Throughout the following decades, the two Adventist camps‚Äîthose who supported and opposed QOD respectively‚Äîcontinued to struggle with the issues it brought up which was not eased by \\"the ambiguous stance taken by General Conference leadership on Questions on Doctrine\\". Much of the controversy had centred on the nature of the incarnate Christ and the Augustinian doctrine of Original Sin. Regarding the Nature of Christ on earth, the prelapsarian position was accepted by the authors of QOD as a 'sine qua non' for acceptance with the Evangelicals. Froom had attempted to support this in QOD with a number of quotations from the writings of Ellen White. He used a \\"cut and paste\\" technique before digitisation was available. In 1978, Dr Ralph Larson published a short pamphlet entitled \\"The Fraud of the Unfallen Nature\\", in which he painstakingly dissected out the clauses pasted together by Froom and decisively demonstrated that in almost every instance the excerpts taken from her writings, in context, said exactly the opposite. He went on to show that Ellen White endorsed the postlapsarian position, either directly or by implication in over 400 quotations. The main use of her writings to endorse the opposite position had come from the famous \\"Baker Letter\\", written by EG White to a Tasmanian pastor who had taken a Christological position of Adoptionism, which was a variant of Arianism. At that time (1890s) the SDA position on the Trinity was moving away from the Arian position of some of the pioneers, such as Uriah Smith. Whilst supporting the equality and divinity of the three members of the Godhead, Ellen White prudently avoided using the term 'Trinity', as the term had variable interpretations by different religious groups, including Catholicism. She had simply warned Baker to be careful how he described the human nature of Christ, lest people were to believe that He was a created being, and therefore take the position that He was a sinner. Larson later published \\"The Word Was Made Flesh\\" in which he devoted a chapter to the misquoting of Ellen White on Christology (available at https://www.amazon.com/Word-Was-Made-Flesh-Seventh-Day/dp/1572580321). Meanwhile, evangelicals were concerned that the withdrawal of QOD signified a doctrinal retreat by Adventists and called for the book to be reprinted. In an interview around 1986 with Adventist Currents, Martin himself said :\\"If the Seventh-day Adventist [Church] will not back up its answers with actions and put Questions on Doctrine back in print... then they're in real trouble that I can't help them out of; and nobody else can either\\"\\"Currents Interview: Walter Martin\\" in Adventist Currents, July 1983, 15. Text as quoted by Kellner QOD was not republished until Andrews University Press independently chose to reprint the book in 2003 as part of their \\"Adventist Classic Library\\" series. This new edition contained annotations and a historical introduction by George R. Knight.World Church: \\"Questions on Doctrine\\" Book Annotated, Republished, Adventist News Network, 18 November 2003. The text of the original book had also been available online for several years prior to this republishing, through a private website. One review is by Nancy Vyhmeister.Nancy Vyhmeister, review of Questions on Doctrine 2003 edition. College and University Dialogue 2005, v17, n3, p30-31 \\"It's a very positive and aggressive statement of Adventist beliefs\\", according to George Knight. \\"This book played an important role in the history of the Adventist Church\\", according to Gerhard Pfandl. Questions on Doctrine generated a theological movement which backs the theology of Andreasen and opposes the teaching set forward in the book. These \\"historic Adventists\\" perceive Questions on Doctrine as representing a major departure from traditional Adventist teaching, and believe that its publication has been harmful to the church. Other Adventists feel that Questions on Doctrine represents a courageous and insightful restatement of Adventist theology, while acknowledging that the book is not free from fault. For instance, it is clear that the authors pushed the facts too far with regard to Adventism's historic understanding of the Trinity, and present data about the human nature of Christ in a way that presents a false impression. Evangelical Kenneth Samples has described four unique perspectives of Walter Martin given by Adventist friends of Samples. A more evangelical Adventist told him, \\"I really like Walter Martin. He stood up for us.\\" A more liberal Adventist said, \\"Who's Walter Martin that he should ever question our orthodoxy?!\\" A more fundamentalist Adventist said, \\"Walter Martin poisoned our church.\\" A cultural Adventist friend said, \\"Who's Walter Martin?\\"!Kenneth Samples, \\"Evangelical Reflections on Seventh-day Adventism: Yesterday and Today\\". Paper presented at the Questions on Doctrine 50th anniversary conference; appears in the audio version (MP3) only [see last two minutes], not his written paper. Walter Martin considered his impact on evangelicals' perception of Adventism one of the highlights of his career. 50th anniversary conference A scholarly conference marking the 50th anniversary of the book's publication was held from October 24‚Äì27, 2007 at Andrews University in Michigan. It was precipitated by Julius Nam's 2005 doctoral dissertation on the book. Chapter 4 available online. Scholars, church leaders and pastors from widely varying positions on the Adventist theological spectrum gathered with non-Adventist evangelical scholars interested in Questions on Doctrine for dialogue. Prior to the event, General Conference administrators including incumbent president Jan Paulsen had voiced reservations and even outright opposition to the conference, fearing that it might reignite a firestorm of controversy within the denomination. In spite of this, the conference was hailed as a success by participants from all sides, and was felt to have promoted \\"healing\\". The organizers of the conference were Julius Nam, Michael W. Campbell and Jerry Moon, Adventist scholars specializing in Adventist history. Three institutions co-sponsored the event: Andrews University, Loma Linda University and Oakwood College. The keynote speakers were conservative theologian Herbert Douglass, Adventist historian George Knight, and Biblical Research Institute director √Ångel Rodr√≠guez. Presenters included Roy Adams, Arthur Patrick, Jon Paulien, Richard Rice, A. Leroy Moore and Woodrow Whidden. The \\"conservative\\" position was represented by Larry Kirkpatrick, Colin and Russell Standish as well as Douglass. In addition there were contributions from non-Adventist scholars Kenneth Samples and Donald Dayton.Keynote speakers and presenters from the Questions on Doctrine website Topics Questions on Doctrine addressed the following topics: * Christology * The role of Ellen G.

Stapleford is first mentioned in 956 when it was given the Latinised name of Stapelforda, formerly Stapleton. Unlike most parishes, the spelling has hardly changed since then. The parish, however, was inhabited long before this. Wandlebury Ring, which lies within the parish boundary, is an Iron Age hill fort, originally built in the 3rd century BC, but rebuilt with a double bank in the 1st century AD. More recently, the village found fame with the discovery that Barack Obama is a direct descendant of one Thomas Blossom, who grew up here towards the end of the 16th century before emigrating to the United States. Stapleford is home to two pubs, The Rose and The Three Horseshoes,. The village also is home to Saint Andrew's church, a primary school, several garages, two hairdressers, allotments, a youth football club, a cricket team and several farms. Famous ex-residents include Robert Huff (racing driver) and Nobel laureates Sir John Sulston and Sir James Mirrlees. From 1750 to 1755, John Berridge, the later evangelist, served as curate in Stapleford near Cambridge, riding out from Clare College. He performed his duties with \\"a sincere desire to do good\\". He preached and taught \\"the importance of sanctification\\". Yet, as Berridge later reflected, his ministry in Stapleford was fruitless because he neither believed nor preached the gospel of justification by faith. Because he believed that he was having \\"no beneficial effect, spiritual or moral\\" on his congregation, he resigned, later to become vicar of Everton, near Sandy. Stapleford is twinned with Villedomer, in the Loire region of France. Stapleford is also twinned with Nachingwea, one of the six districts in the Lindi Region of Tanzania.

The aim was to destroy Imperial Japanese installations, take prisoners, gain intelligence on the Gilbert Islands area, and divert Japanese attention and reinforcements from the Allied landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi. Preparations and organization The raid was among the first American offensive ground combat operations of World War II. The force was drawn from the 2nd Raider Battalion and comprised a small battalion command group and two of the battalion's six rifle companies. Because of space limitations aboard ship, each company embarked without one of its rifle sections. Battalion headquarters, A Company and 18 men from B Company‚Äîtotaling 121 troops‚Äîwere embarked aboard the submarine and the remainder of B Company‚Äîtotaling 90 men‚Äîaboard . The raiding force was designated Task Group 7.15 (TG 7.15).Rottman (2005), pp.59‚Äì60. The Imperial Japanese Navy created the Makin Atoll Garrison in 1942. It was part of the Marshall Islands Garrison, and officially titled the 62nd Garrison Force.Á¨¨62Ë≠¶ÂÇôÈöä At the time of the Makin raid the total force opposing the American landing consisted of 71 armed personnel of the Japanese seaplane base led by Warrant Officer (Heisouchou) Kyuzaburo Kanemitsu of the Special Naval Landing Force equipped with light weapons. In addition there were also four members of the seaplane tender base and three members of a meteorological unit. Two civilian personnel were attached to the Japanese forces as interpreters and civilian administrators. Execution of raid Makin as seen by USS Nautilus The Marine Raiders were launched in LCRL rubber boats powered by small, outboard motors shortly after 00:00 (midnight) on 17 August. At 05:13, Companies A and B of the 2nd Raider Battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. Evans Carlson, successfully landed on Makin. The landing had been very difficult because of rough seas, high surf, and the failure of many of the outboard motors. Lt. Col. Carlson decided to land all his men on one beach, rather than two beaches as originally planned. At 05:15, Lt. Oscar Peatross and a 12-man squad landed on Makin. In the confusion of the landing, they did not get word of Carlson's decision to change plans and to land all the Raiders on one beach. Thus, Peatross and his men landed where they originally planned. It turned out to be a fortunate error. Undaunted by the lack of support, Peatross led his men inland. At 07:00, with Company A leading, the Raiders advanced from the beach across the island to its north shore before attacking southwestward. Strong resistance from Japanese snipers and machine guns stalled the advance and inflicted casualties. The Japanese then launched two banzai charges, which were wiped out by the Raiders, thus killing most of the Japanese on the island. At 09:00, Lt. Peatross and his 12 men found themselves behind the Japanese, who were fighting the rest of the Raiders to the east. Peatross's unit killed eight Japanese and the garrison commander Sgt. Major Kanemitsu, knocked out a machine gun and destroyed the enemy radios but suffered three dead and two wounded. Failing to contact Carlson, they withdrew to the subs at dusk, as planned. At 13:30, 12 Japanese planes, including two flying boats, arrived over Makin. The flying boats, carrying reinforcements for the Japanese garrison, attempted to land in the lagoon but were met with machine gun, rifle and Boys anti-tank rifle fire from the Raiders. One plane crashed, and the other burst into flames. The remaining planes bombed and strafed but inflicted no American casualties. Evacuation of Raiders At 19:30, the Raiders began to withdraw from the island using 18 rubber boats, many of which no longer had working outboard motors. Despite heavy surf, seven boats with 93 men made it to the subs. The next morning several boatloads of Raiders were able to fight the surf and reach the sub, but 72 men, along with just three rubber boats, were still on the island. At 23:30, the attempt by most of the Raiders to reach the submarines failed. Despite hours of heroic effort, 11 of 18 boats were unable to breach the unexpectedly+strong surf. Having lost most of their weapons and equipment, the exhausted survivors struggled back to the beach to link up with 20-fully armed men, who had been left on the island to cover their withdrawal. An exhausted and dispirited Carlson dispatched a note to the Japanese commander that offered to surrender, but the Japanese messenger was killed by other Marines, who were unaware of Carlson's plan.p. 27 Wiles, Tripp Forgotten Raiders of '42: The fate of the Marines Left Behind on Makin Potomac Books, Inc., 31/03/2007 At 09:00 on 18 August, the subs sent a rescue boat to stretch rope from the ships to the shore that would allow the remaining Raiders' boats to be pulled out to sea. However, just as the operation began, Japanese planes arrived and attacked, sinking the rescue boat and attacking the subs, which were forced to crash dive and wait on the bottom the rest of the day. The subs were undamaged. At 23:08, having managed to signal the subs to meet his Raiders at the entrance to Makin Lagoon, Carlson had a team, led by Lt. Charlie Lamb, build a raft made up of three rubber boats and two native canoes, powered by the two remaining outboard motors. Using that raft, 72 exhausted Raiders sailed 4 miles from Makin to the mouth of the lagoon, where the subs picked them up. =Casualties= A Marine Raider, injured during the Makin operation, is lifted through a hatch on USS Argonaut to be taken ashore at Pearl Harbor, 26 August 1942. USMC casualties were given as 18 killed in action and 12 missing in action. Of the 12 Marines missing in action, one was later identified among the 19 Marine Corps graves found on Makin Island.Pacific Wrecks website Of the remaining eleven Marines missing in action, nineLeatherneck forum were inadvertently left behind or returned to the island during the night withdrawal. They were subsequently captured, moved to Kwajalein Atoll, and executed by Japanese forces. K≈çs≈ç Abe was subsequently tried and executed by the Allies for the murder of the nine Marines. The remaining two Marines missing in action have never been accounted for. Carlson reported that he had personally counted 83 Japanese bodies and estimated that 160 Japanese were killed based on reports from the Makin Island natives with whom he spoke. Additional Japanese personnel may have been killed in the destruction of two boats and two aircraft. Morison states that 60 Japanese were killed in the sinking of one of the boats. Japanese records are however more precise and the entire garrison casualties were 46 killed of all ranks (not including the purported large casualties Carlson reported for the boats he had sunk). This was confirmed when supporting Japanese forces returned to the island and found 27 Japanese survivors of the raid.Sato Kasumasa, \\"Gyokusai no Shima,\\" Kojinsha Press, Tokyo,2004, pp.54-55, Conclusions This is a plaque commemorating the Makin Island Raid in 1942. This plaque is located on the island of Kwajalein. Although the Marine Raiders succeeded in annihilating the Imperial Japanese garrison on the island, the raid failed to meet its other material objectives. No Japanese prisoners were taken, and no meaningful intelligence was collected. Also, no significant Japanese forces were diverted from the Solomon Islands area. In fact, because the vulnerabilities to their garrisons in the Gilbert Islands were highlighted by the raid, the Japanese strengthened their fortifications and defensive preparations on the islands in the central Pacific. As a result, the objective to dissipate Japanese forces may have had the unintended consequence of causing heavier losses for American forces during the battles of the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaigns. However, the raid did succeed in its objectives of boosting morale and testing Raider tactics.Pearl Harbor To Guadalcanal, History Of The Marine Corps Operations In World War II, Volume I, p. 284. Bioarchaeological recovery In 2000, 58 years after the raid, the remains of 19 Marines were found on Makin Island through bioarchaeological excavation and recovery, then sent to the Defense Department's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii, where they were identified. Six of these Marines were returned to their families for private burial ceremonies. The remaining 13 were buried with full honors at Arlington National Cemetery after a funeral service at Fort Myer Chapel at which the Marine Commandant General James L. Jones spoke. The remaining eleven Marines have not yet been located.http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/raiders-1942.htm References in popular culture The raid on Makin is featured in Call of Duty: World at War, in the first single player level ‚ÄòSemper Fi‚Äô, and as a campaign location in the game Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault. W.E.B. Griffin's novel Call To Arms, Book Two of The Corps series, focuses on the forming of the Marine Raiders and the raid on Makin Island, as told through the novel's protagonist, Lt. Kenneth 'Killer' McCoy. The 1943 American war film Gung Ho! was loosely based on the raid, and Evans Carlson was employed as a technical advisor during production. See also *Dallas H. Cook *Clyde A.

Founded as Carl Ally, Inc. in 1963, Ally elevated partner Amil Gargano and renamed the firm Ally & Gargano in 1976. Ally sold his voting stock in the agency to Gargano in 1979, remaining chairman. That year Edward M. Gallagher joined A&G; as chief operating officer, and quickly brought in the MCI account. The company went public in 1983, but a string of client losses and budget cutbacks increased internal tensions. Ally formally retired from Ally & Gargano on January 1, 1985, and in June 1986, Marketing Corporation of America (MCA) bought Ally & Gargano for $26.6 million. After further account losses, including the showcase Saab account in December 1988, MCA sold control and 50 percent of the agency to Wesray Capital Corporation for $30 million. Carl Ally was inducted into the American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame in 1991, and Gargano left A&G; that year when his contract expired. The agency closed on July 26, 1995.

Features  XVidCap works using an on-line encoding facility with the FFmpeg libavcodec / libavformat. It can capture any movement on an X11 display either as single frames (like a number of JPEG images) or it can encode the captured frames to a video on-line. It can also grab and embed an audio recording provided users have an OSS compatible system and FFMPEG libraries with compiled audio capture support.  History  Rasca Gmelch developed an early version that was able to capture to individual frames and save them in individual screenshot files. Whilst this approach requires considerable storage, these files could later be converted into a video with tools like transcode.

Accessed February 19, 2011. \\"Frederick Erastus Humphreys was born September 16, 1883, at Summit, New Jersey, the only child of Jay and Fannie Brush Humphreys.\\" He attended the Pennsylvania Military College, and won an appointment from New York to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He was made Cadet Captain, he lettered in fencing, and was the top eighth student of seventy-eight in the West Point Class of 1906. After graduation and commissioning, he was assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers and sent to Fort Riley, Kansas where he worked in bridge construction. 2nd Lt. Humphreys deployed to Cuba during the Pacification Expedition, and a year later, returned to attend the Engineer Officer Basic Course. Humphreys volunteered for assignment to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps and was chosen to replace Benjamin Foulois in pilot training by the Wright brothers. On October 26, 1909, after three hours of instruction by Wilbur Wright, he became the first Army aviator to solo in a heavier-than-air craft, and thus the first pilot of the first progenitor of the United States Air Force. The Army's sole military airplane crashed on November 5, 1909, after which Humphreys returned to the Corps of Engineers. In 1910, Humphreys resigned his commission to attend to his father's business, the Humphreys Homeopathic Medicine Company, founded by his grandfather in 1853. Thereafter he served as an officer of the company, the last twelve years of his life as its president. =National Guard= In June 1915, Humphreys joined the New York National Guard's 22d Engineers Regiment as a First Lieutenant. He was called up with his regiment for Mexican Border service after Pancho Villa's raids in 1916, he served as an aide to Major General John F. O'Ryan, Commanding General of the New York (later 27th) Division. Shortly after his return to New York, the regiment was inducted into federal service for World War I. After initial service with his regiment at the divisional training post at Spartanburg, South Carolina, he was recalled and was transferred to the Air Service in January 1918. After flight training at Rockwell Field in San Diego, California he was assigned to the first class of the School of Military Aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for advanced technical training. He remained at MIT as head of the school's Department of Practical Aircraft Design, and then was made school commander. At about the time of the Armistice, he was assigned to the newly founded Technical Section, Engineering Division, at McCook Field, in Dayton, Ohio, remaining there until he was demobilized in February 1919. He returned to New York, and was appointed Colonel of the 102nd Army Engineers, a position he had until his retirement due to ill health on July 11, 1939. At the time he was the senior Colonel of New York. He was advanced to Brigadier General on the State Retired List. =Death= Recuperating from pneumonia in Miami Beach, Florida he had a heart attack and died in 1941. He was 57 years old, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

He is an Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and a fellow of the British Academy. He has published on international political economy, law, the First World War and land tenure. During the 1990s and 2000s, Offer's main interest was in post-war economic growth, particularly in developed societies, and the challenges that affluence presents to well being. His most recent work is on the strife between neoclassical economics and social democracy, each of them vying to shape the post-war decades. Apart from his academic work, he has published a memoir of the Six Day War in Israel. Biography Avner Offer was born and raised in Israel. He was educated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (B.A. 1973) and Oxford University (D.Phil. 1979). He has worked at the University of York, the Australian National University, and the University of Oxford, with research fellowships at the University of Southampton, the University of Cambridge, Rutgers University and New York University. He was a Professorial Fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, between 1992 and 2000. He is married with two children. Offer's book of 2006, The Challenge of Affluence: Self-Control and Well-Being in the United States and Britain since 1950, represents to some extent a challenge to Neoclassical economics. Through it he argues that \\"well-being\\" has in fact lagged behind the increasing affluence of western societies: that \\"affluence breeds impatience, and impatience undermines well-being...the paradox of affluence and its challenge is that the flow of new rewards can undermine the capacity to enjoy them.\\"The Challenge of Affluence: Self-control and Well-being in the USA and Britain since 1950. (Oxford, 2006) The central concepts are therefore future discount, bounded rationality, and myopia. In the 2016 The Nobel Factor: The Prize in Economics, Social Democracy, and the Market Turn, he argues the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics has disproportionately been awarded to proponents of the neoclassical school. According to the book's thesis, the Nobel Prize provides a halo of scientific authority but its committee has underrepresented social democracy as a school of economical thought.

It is a component of Australian bushfood, but is considered an agricultural weed in other areas. Description C. bulbosus is perennial and rhizomatous, with fine grassy foliage and triangular culms. The inflorescence is rarely branched and consists of a cluster of spikes of reddish-brown bracts, eventually producing small, three-sided seeds. The small tubers which form on short stolons are a traditional bush tucker food for Australian Aboriginal peoples. They are dug up on creek banks when the grass of the onion has dried out. The husk can also be eaten. They are eaten raw or cooked in the hot earth by the fire. Cultural significance Its name in the Arrernte language of Central Australia is merne yalke. In a neighbouring language, Kaytetye, it is called erreyakwerra. Some Kaytetye, the Kwerrimpe women, have a bush onion dreamingTurpin, Myfany (comp.), Growing up Kaytete: Stories by Tommy Kngwarraye Thompson, Jukurrpa Books, Alice Springs, 2003, , pp 3-5 which involves the bush onion and the origins of the Kaytetye people and language.

Background \\"Kaw-Liga\\" is one of just a handful of songs that Williams wrote with Fred Rose, who produced his records and published his songs through his company Acuff-Rose. Rose often \\"doctored\\" the songs Hank composed, making suggestions and revisions, with biographer Roger M. Williams noting that Rose's contribution to Hank's songs was probably craftsmanship, whereas Williams' was genius. Roy Acuff later recalled: Kowaliga is a community in central Alabama on Lake Martin. Named after a legendary Native American for which a wooden statue was later placed near the lake, the song was written by Hank when he was staying at a lakeside cabin that he owned and still stands today. Content The song tells the story of a wooden Indian, Kaw-Liga, who falls in love with an \\"Indian maid over in the antique store\\" but does not tell her so, being, as the lyrics say: The Indian maid waits for Kaw-Liga to signal his affection for her, but he either refuses or is physically/emotionally unable (interpretations vary) to talk. Some interpret Kaw-Liga as a stoical Native American stereotype but the subject of masculine pride and emotional hardness is a popular one in country music and the then common \\"dime-store Indians\\" (which were the store's way of advertising that they sold tobacco) being made of unmoving wood was a perfect symbol of the general aversion to expression of emotion common to all men. Because of his stubbornness, Kaw-Liga's love continues to be unrequited, with Hank Williams, the narrator/singer of the song lamenting, The song ends with the Indian maid being bought and taken away from the antique store by a buyer, leaving Kaw- Liga alone, and he Recording and release The song was recorded as part of William's final recording session on September 23, 1952 at Castle Studio in Nashville. The remarkably productive session also produced \\"I Could Never Be Ashamed of You,\\" (written for his soon-to-be wife Billie Jean), \\"Take These Chains From My Heart\\" (also written by Rose), and Hank's masterpiece ballad \\"Your Cheatin' Heart.\\" More than any other song, \\"Kaw-Liga\\" bears evidence of the guiding hand of Rose, who moulded the song into nothing like Williams had recorded up to that point. It begins in a minor key, which modulates into a major key on the chorus, and also features big band drummer Farris Coursey, who had played brushes on Williams' previous song \\"Moanin' the Blues\\" and played in WSM's dance band. In addition, the song fades out, the only Hank Williams song to do so. Williams is also backed by Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Chet Atkins (lead guitar), Jack Shook (rhythm guitar), and Floyd \\"Lightnin'\\" Chance (bass). The single was released posthumously in January 1953 on the MGM Records label and it remained No. 1 on the Billboard Country chart for 14 weeks. The flipside, \\"Your Cheatin' Heart, remained #1 on the country chart for 6 weeks. A demo version of Williams singing \\"Kaw-Liga\\" with just his guitar, likely recorded in 1951, is also available. On the recording, Williams flubs a chord and can be heard muttering \\"shit\\" before starting the song again. In 1996, \\"Kaw-Liga\\" was referenced by Tracy Lawrence‚Äôs single \\"Time Marches On\\", featuring the lyrics \\"Hank Williams sings 'Kaw-Liga' and 'Dear John' and time marches on.\\" \\"Time Marches On\\" held the number one spot on Billboard‚Äôs Hot Country Songs chart for three weeks.

Campbell Ewald is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG). Controversy Campbell Ewald‚Äôs Social Media group gained notoriety in 2006 with a user-generated content campaign for the Chevrolet Tahoe called the Chevy Apprentice, which allowed the public to create their own Tahoe ad in hopes of winning a new Tahoe SUV. Controversy arose when several environmentalist groups began creating anti-Chevrolet ads that garnered national media attention. Overall, the controversy only helped as the Tahoe had the most successful launch in Chevrolet history. History The 109-year-old agency has a long-standing history in the Detroit metropolitan area and the advertising industry. In 1911, Frank Campbell and Henry Ewald merged their individual Detroit companies to form Campbell Ewald, beginning with just six employees. Campbell, a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, left the business in 1917 to work in relief in war ravaged France, and subsequently lived a life of adventure until his death in Oregon, when he was crushed by a boulder at age 72. Henry Ewald was left to run the agency. Chevrolet became the agency's first major client in 1919 and by 1922, Campbell Ewald was awarded all of General Motors' ad business. The agency continued its partnership with GM for more than 90 years. They later diversified into the government, healthcare, retail, technology and other fields. Campbell Ewald became a part of the Interpublic Group of Companies in 1972. Adweek named Campbell Ewald Midwest Agency of the Year for the second consecutive year in 2002, citing their win of the United States Postal Service account, in addition to their continued work for clients such as the U.S. Navy and Chevy. In April 2010, GM moved Chevrolet ad works to rival agency Publicis Worldwide, ending a 91-year relationship with Campbell Ewald.

Voice modems are used for telephony and answering machine applications. Similar to the Hayes command set used for data modems, in which the host PC commands the modem via a series of commands known as AT commands, there exists a well- defined set of common voice AT commands that are somewhat consistent throughout the industry. Implementation problems Because voice mode is not the typical use for a modem, many modems on the market have poor or buggy support for their voice modes. Characteristics of a good voice modem depend greatly upon the intended application, and include: * Reliable operation. Many modems simply \\"lock up\\" or crash the host PC, though this is more common with Winmodems. Others have flow control bugs and other implementation bugs, possibly causing calls to hang, audio to skip, or audio to keep playing after an attempted abort. * Good audio characteristics. Some modems have an uncorrectably low signal volume or produce audio noise. Some modems are unable to recognize all but the best DTMF signals. Some modems do a poor job of recording, or detecting and reporting silence or the end-of-call voltage reversal, which some applications need. * Support for caller ID, if needed. \\"Type-1 caller ID\\" as used in North America is missing from the vast majority of modems. Nearly all modem chipsets support caller ID, but because the typical dial-up Internet user doesn't need caller ID, the extra components needed to support caller ID are often omitted for cost reasons. * Support for multiple instances. The drivers for many internal modems (typically Winmodems) cannot tolerate more than one of the same device inside a single computer. Symptoms of incompatibility include crashes, blue screens of death, or simple inoperability of all but a single modem. External RS-232-based (serial) modems do not have this limitation because each modem contains its own microprocessor and is unaware of other modems on the same host. USB modems may or may not have this problem, because some USB modems are simply serial modems with a \\"USB-to-serial\\" converter chipset (in which case there should be no problem), and other USB modems are \\"host-controlled\\" and are essentially externally attached Winmodems (in which case the problem may persist). Plus versus Hash Each voice modem platform tends to support either one of two sets of voice commands‚Äîin particular, one flavor of the command set contains a plus (+) sign, and the other contains a hash (#) sign. Detecting voice mode Support for voice mode can be detected on a modem by issuing the following command: AT+FCLASS=? This command is usually supported containing the plus sign whether a modem supports \\"plus\\" or the \\"hash\\" command set, because the command (which stands for \\"fax class\\") is part of the industry-standard fax commands which always use the plus. A modem supporting voice will respond with a comma-delimited list of numbers that includes the number 8. A modem not supporting voice will respond with ERROR, or with a list of numbers not including 8. (Many modems will report 0,1,2 indicating support for data (0), and class 1 and 2 faxes‚Äîthis is an indication that voice support is not present.) Modems supporting the \\"hash\\" command set usually respond to AT#CLS=? as well. Entering voice mode The command AT+FCLASS=8 or AT#CLS=8 will put the modem in voice mode. Most modems still remain on-hook and respond with OK. Once this command has been accepted, most modems will respond with Data Link Escape (DLE) messages instead of or in addition to normal modem responses. For example, instead of reporting a phone line ringing with the RING message, many modems will instead send the DLE ASCII character, followed by the letter R. The specific set of DLE events reported by each modem is specific to its chipset and documented in its reference guide. Querying the modem's capabilities The command AT+VLS=? or AT#VLS=? usually returns a list of operating modes that are specific to each modem. Each of these numbered modes determines the telephone line's on-hook or off-hook status, as well as sound routing between each of the following: * Recording/playback * Telephone handset * Speakerphone jack (which could simply be hard-wired as an audio input on the PC's sound card instead of being a discrete jack) * Microphone jack (available on some voice modems) Many chipsets offer a listing of all the possible combinations of modes even if the specific modem board doesn't support them all. That's because the board manufacturer is almost always different from the chipset maker, and the chipset comes pre-configured to support all possible hardware, even if not implemented on the circuit board. Example of response to AT+VLS=? from a modem on the market in 2006: AT+VLS=? 0,\\"\\",0000000000,0000000000,B084008000 1,\\"T\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,0B8419E000 2,\\"L\\",0884008000,0CE4008000,0884018000 3,\\"LT\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,0B8419E000 4,\\"S\\",0084008000,0484008000,3084018000 5,\\"ST\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,0B8419E000 6,\\"M\\",0084008000,04E4008000,3084008000 7,\\"MST\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,0B8419E000 8,\\"S1\\",0084008000,0484008000,3084018000 9,\\"S1T\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,0B8419E000 10,\\"MS1T\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,0B8419E000 11,\\"M1\\",0084008000,04E4008000,3084008000 13,\\"M1S1T\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,0B8419E000 14,\\"H\\",0084008000,04E4008000,3084018000 15,\\"HT\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,0B8419E000 16,\\"MS\\",0084008000,04E4008000,3084018000 17,\\"MS1\\",0084008000,04E4008000,3084018000 19,\\"M1S1\\",0084008000,04E4008000,3084018000 20,\\"t\\",0B8418E000,0FE418E000,BB8419E000 While every modem is different, usually mode 0 means on-hook (hung up) and mode 1 is sufficient to pick up the phone, record/playback audio, and detect DTMF (touch tones). The command AT+VSM=? or AT#VSM=? usually returns a list of audio data formats supported by the modem. Each format includes a name (such as PCM, ADPCM, Œº-law, A-law), a number of bits per sample (usually 2, 3, 4, 8, or 16) and an audio sampling rate (usually 7,200, 8,000, or 11,025 Hertz). These are industry-standard audio codecs whose implementations are well published. The ADPCM standard is an exception. Modems claiming to support ADPCM almost always support Dialogic ADPCM, also known as \\"VOX\\", which is similar but not compatible with other ADPCM implementations, including Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA) ADPCM as well as MS ADPCM (a Microsoft implementation used in WAV files). Modems may support these as well, if a qualifier is listed‚Äîotherwise, by default, ADPCM means Dialogic. Example response to AT+VSM=? from a modem on the market in 2006: AT+VSM=? 1,\\"UNSIGNED PCM\\",8,0,8000,0,0 129,\\"IMA ADPCM\\",4,0,8000,0,0 130,\\"UNSIGNED PCM\\",8,0,8000,0,0 140,\\"2 Bit ADPCM\\",2,0,8000, 141,\\"4 Bit ADPCM\\",4,0,8000,0,0 The desired audio data format is selected using the same command but with a number instead of a question mark. It is used for both sending and receiving. Answering calls Answering calls is usually done with either the AT+VLS=n or AT#VLS=n commands, where n is a number representing the modem's mode. For the vast majority of modems, this number will be 1 to answer a telephone call, and 0 to hang up; other numbers activate other functionality when present, such as speakerphone. Some modems answer in response to ATA‚Äîthe standard data-mode answer command‚Äîbut other modems will interpret this as a command to actually answer in data and not voice mode. Transmitting audio data To begin transmitting audio data, the host sends the command AT+VTX or AT#VTX. This results in a response from the modem of CONNECT or VCON. (Modems using the \\"plus\\" command set usually respond CONNECT, while those using the \\"hash\\" set respond VCON, which stands for voice connect.) From then on, the modem interprets any data sent from the computer as wave audio data, using the codec selected by the AT+VSM or AT#VSM command. The audio data is always sent to the modem slightly faster than it can play it, so the modem may buffer a small portion of it and play it smoothly with no clicks or pops caused by delays in the computer's operating system. For example, during playback of an 8 kHz audio file at 8-bit resolution (which creates 8,000 bytes, or 80,000 bits when including start/stop bits, per second), the data must travel over the serial port at a minimum of 115,200 bits per second. (115,200 bit/s is the first setting of a typical computer serial port that's greater than 80,000.) In addition, due to some extra overhead involved in doubling DLE bytes in the stream (mentioned below), a small amount of extra bandwidth is mandatory to allow for this. When the modem wants the computer to temporarily pause so the playback can catch up, it temporarily lowers the CTS (Clear to Send) signal on the RS-232 serial port. The modem re-raises the signal in time for the computer to resume sending audio data before the playback buffer becomes completely empty. When the computer wants to signal the end of audio data, most modems expect to see an ASCII DLE character (0x10), followed by the ! character. Because the DLE byte can and often does occur in normal audio data, it must be sent twice to the modem when it is to be interpreted as a byte of audio data. Most modems also accept a sequence of DLE + CAN (cancel) as a signal to cancel audio playback. The distinction is that the modem is to understand that it is to immediately abort playback now, rather than let remaining data in the playback buffer run to completion. When the modem is done playback, it responds OK. =Throttling playback= During playback, it is necessary to send the audio data at a rate that keeps the audio playing smoothly, but without sending it faster than the modem can handle it. It is also desirable to make sure the modem can always abort playback and discard any buffered audio in case a message is to be canceled. Message cancellation is expected by callers who already know the answers to voice prompts and provide their answer early (and who would become irritated at being forced to listen to a prompt they've already responded to). There are several ways to keep the computer sending audio data to the modem at a rate to keep up with playback without overrunning the audio buffer. The most straightforward is to use CTS flow control. The following caveats exist. * Some voice modems have bugs in their implementation of flow control. In particular, a large number of Conexant chipsets will sometimes drop their CTS line and never bring it back up during playback. Conexant is a hugely popular chipset in voice modems today and they otherwise implement voice commands well, making it worthwhile to consider working around this bug. Some Conexant chipsets will also not bring CTS back up if the \\"playback abort\\" command is sent or processed by the modem while CTS is down. * Some voice modems offer a very large transmit buffer (for example, 4 seconds' worth of audio) coupled with a bug that prevents the host from requesting an \\"abort playback\\". The result is that if a caller presses a touch-tone that's supposed to interrupt a message, and the host is providing unlimited audio data mediated by CTS alone, the end result is that the message can't be interrupted for at least 4 seconds. A second way to throttle playback involves polling a \\"tick\\" timer provided by the host computer's operating system and based on a hardware clock that's independent of the host's CPU load. This may or may not be available, and it depends entirely on the host operating system. However, when available, it is extremely reliable. It is reasonable to assume that the PC needs to stay ahead of the playback by a couple of hundred bytes and that the modem will buffer this. (The commands AT+VBQ or AT#VBQ on voice modems will often reveal the size of the buffer in bytes, and 1 to 2 kilobytes is a typical response.) A third way to throttle playback involves inserting dummy DLE messages into the output stream such that the audio data takes a known amount of time to transmit through the serial port, and the playback is essentially clocked by the UART in the serial port. For example, when considering using dummy DLE stuffing, a few things must first be noted. In a typical scenario, one second of audio might be 8,000 one-byte samples, and with a small percentage of the samples being equal to the DLE byte and must be doubled, a typical second of audio might be 8,050 bytes. The trick involves inserting enough meaningless DLE messages into the bytes that the modem will discard (that is, a DLE followed by a byte without any specific meaning) so that there are exactly 11,520 bytes (assuming a serial port locked at 115,200 bit/s) which will take exactly 1 second to transmit through the serial port. Although it is possible that interrupt latency on the host PC may cause slightly less than 11,520 bytes to be sent per second, most voice modems will buffer enough bytes before actually starting playback to permit a small skew here. Also the PC can be programmed to convert a second of audio into slightly fewer than 11,520 bytes (all voice modems will buffer a small overrun without the need for flow control as long as it is no more than a few hundred bytes). Dummy DLE stuffing is unlikely to work with \\"Winmodems\\" that have no physical UART. It makes sense only with external serial modems that are physically clocked to a specific bit rate by a clock generator behind the external serial port. Recording audio data The method for recording audio data is the same, except that the command is AT+VRX, or AT#VRX, and the modem transmits audio data while the computer receives it. The RTS/CTS flow control are not used here (the computer must accept all the audio data it receives, and the modem automatically paces its transmission to match the audio sampling rate). The modem never stops transmitting until the computer tells it to stop, which is usually with CTRL-C. The data is always terminated with DLE+!, and all DLE bytes naturally occurring in the stream are sent twice to differentiate them from normal DLE messages. Before, during, and after recording, the modem may notify the computer host of specific events including, but not limited to, the following: * Touch-tone keypresses detected * Silence detected * Line polarity reversal detected (often meaning caller hang-up) * Dial tone detected * Fax tone detected When the modem wants to tell the host about these, it sends a DLE byte, plus a (usually) 1-byte message describing the event. The list of supported events varies by modem, but usually a digit (as well as * and #) mean touch-tones pressed, and the letter \\"s\\" means silence detected. Some modems report only one event for each touch-tone keypress, while others report a keypress repeatedly until the key is released, and then a special \\"key released\\" event. Terminating a voice call Any of the following commands usually cause the modem to hang up and terminate a voice call: AT+VLS=0, AT#VLS=0, ATH, ATZ. Dropping the RS-232 DTR (data terminal ready) signal often accomplishes this as well. The modem remains in voice mode (except in the case of ATZ). Voice modems do not automatically hang up even when the caller on the other end does. They may report the hangup, dialtone, or silence events, but it is up to the computer to act upon them. If when the modem is recording, the caller hangs up and the computer doesn't react, the modem will continue providing the audio recording everything else heard on the line, such as dial tones, telephone company error messages, and so forth.

The detrusor muscle remains relaxed to allow the bladder to store urine, and contracts during urination to release urine.Netdoctor.co.uk - The bladder and how it works Reviewed by Dr Hilary McPherson, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and Dr Kate Patrick, specialist registrar Related are the urethral sphincter muscles which envelop the urethra to control the flow of urine when they contract. In older adults over 60 years in age, the detrusor muscle may cause issues in voiding the bladder, resulting in uncomfortable urinary retention. Structure The fibers of the detrusor muscle arise from the posterior surface of the body of the pubis in both sexes (musculi pubovesicales), and in the male from the adjacent part of the prostate. These fibers pass, in a more or less longitudinal manner, up the inferior surface of the bladder, over its apex, and then descend along its fundus to become attached to the prostate in the male, and to the front of the vagina in the female. At the sides of the bladder the fibers are arranged obliquely and intersect one another. The 3 layers of muscles are arranged longitudinal-circular-longitudinal from innermost to outermost. Function During urination the muscle is contracted via parasympathetic branches from the pelvic splanchnic nerves to empty the bladder. At other times the muscle is kept relaxed via sympathetic branches from the inferior hypogastric plexus to allow the bladder to fill.

It was previously home to Ronald J. Duke Lake, a artificial lake on the North Fork of the Dunkard Fork of Wheeling Creek, that was constructed in 1960, but drained in 2005 due to structural concerns about the dam. Ryerson Station State Park is from Wind Ridge just off Pennsylvania Route 21 very close to the West Virginia state line. History The park is named for Fort Ryerson. This fort was constructed by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1792 to resist the raids of local Native Americans who fought against the settlement of the Ohio River Valley by the United States. Ownership of the land in this part of Pennsylvania was disputed among several parties including Virginia, Pennsylvania and the Native Americans. The state acquired the land in 1958. Duke Lake was completed with the construction of a dam in 1960 and finally the park was opened in 1967. Recreation There is a camping facility on a ridge overlooking the park. There are 48 sites for tents and travel trailers. There are no flush toilets or showers at the camp site. Group tenting is permitted in the large group tenting area. Two wooden cottages are available for rent. The cottages have electric lights and outlets as well as double and single bunks that sleep up to five, wooden floors, windows, skylights, a porch, fire ring, and picnic table. Over 275 picnic tables are available for use on the ground of Ryerson Station State Park. The park also has five pavilions. There is a small playground in the main picnic area. Hunting is permitted in of Ryerson Station State Park. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, eastern gray squirrels, wild turkey and white-tailed deer. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Duke Lake had been stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission with trout in the spring and again in the fall. Non-powered and electric powered boats with current registration from any state and having a launching or mooring permit from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission had been permitted onto the waters of the lake. Gasoline powered boats were prohibited. In July 2005, Duke Lake was drawn down due to concerns about the structural integrity of the dam across the North Fork of the Dunkard Fork of Wheeling Creek. As of March 2012, the lake bed remains dry. Structural cracks in the Duke Lake Dam are reported to be the result of longwall mining. The dam had been scheduled to be rebuilt by 2017 in a deal with Consol Energy that allowed the company to refrain from admitting fault for the original damage, continue mining under the park, and begin drilling for natural gas under the park in the future. However, due to the ground's mining-related instability, the rebuild was abandoned in 2015. The swimming pool is open from 11:00 am until 7:00 pm beginning Memorial Day weekend and ending Labor Day weekend. The park has of hiking trails. The trails pass through several different habitats, mature forests, evergreen plantations, wet valley bottoms and fields. The snow-covered slopes of the park are opened to sledding and tobogganing when the weather permits. Duke Lake is open for ice fishing and ice skating. Fish and skate at your own risk as the thickness of the ice is not monitored by the park staff. Cross-country skiing and snowmobiling are permitted on some of the hiking trails.

Description It is a graceful, pendulous shade tree, which grows from about tall and has a trunk with a diameter of up to about 0.45 m. It has a spreading crown that becomes weeping as the tree matures. Young plants have rigid branches and short straight phyllodes that appear in clusters as trees mature the branches become pendulous and the light green spiky phyllodes in crease in length but are no longer clustered. It has a heavy bloom of spherical pale yellow flowers after winter rains. The tree has a slow growth rate and is both drought and frost tolerant. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1882 as part of the work Definitions of some new Australian plants as published in Southern Science Record. It was reclassified as Racosperma estrophiolatum by Leslie Pedley in 1987 then returned to the genus Acacia in 2001. It is closely related to Acacia excelsa and more distantly related to Acacia dolichophylla. The type specimen was collected near the Finke River in the Northern Territory by H.Kempe. Distribution The tree is found in north western parts of South Australia, southern parts of the Northern Territory and eastern parts of the Pilbara and Goldfields regions of Western Australia. It is usually found in areas with about 220‚Äì350 mm/year of average rainfall. A. estrophiolata grows mostly on sandy alluvial flats in sandy well drained soils, found as scattered trees among tall open shrubland and open woodland communities. Uses =Food= Traditionally, Australian Aborigines would use the gum from the tree as a sweet bushtucker treat. Its name in the Arrernte language of Central Australia is Ngkwarle athenge arlperle. It is still sometimes eaten today. Acacia estrophiolata Bark The gum is snapped off the branches, either clear or red. It is then ground and mixed with a little water, then left to set again to a chewable gum, and eaten with a small stick. =Forage= The tree makes good forage for livestock. The seeds are edible and are 28.9% protein. Acacia estrophiolata Foliage =Traditional medicine= Parts of the tree are used topically to treat skin problems such as burns, cuts, scabies, sores and it is also used for treating major wounds. It is used as a lotion to treat eye problems. =Wood= The wood is very hard and it is good for making posts for fences. It is used by indigenous Australians to make spears and arrows.

He is known for his excellent lithographs of cross-sections of the human body, and his pioneer work in biomechanics. He also pioneered the use of frozen cadavers for anatomical investigations. Biography He studied at the universities of G√∂ttingen and W√ºrzburg. In 1872, he became professor of topographical anatomy at the University of Leipzig. Braune was inspired by the photographic work of French scientist √âtienne-Jules Marey (1830‚Äì1904) involving anatomical movement. Marey believed that movement was the most important of all human functions, which he described graphically for biological research in Du mouvement dans les fonctions de la vie (1892) and Le Mouvement (1894). These works helped lead the way towards Braune's experimental, anatomical studies of the human gait, being published in the book Der Gang des Menschen (co-written with physiologist Otto Fischer 1861‚Äì1917).WorldCat Titles 'Der Gang des Menschen Braune's study of biomechanics of gait covered two transits of free walking and one transit of walking with a load. The methodology of gait analysis used by Braune is essentially the same used today. With Otto Fischer, he conducted research involving the position of the center of gravity in the human body and its various segments. By first determining the planes of the \\"gravitational centers\\" of the longitudinal, sagittal and frontal axes of a frozen human cadaver in a given position, and then dissecting the cadaver with a saw, they were able to establish the center of gravity of the body and its component parts. Braune and Fischer also did extensive work on the fundamentals of resistive forces that the body's muscles need to overcome during movement. In unrelated investigative work, Braune had a decisive role in the publication of the musical pieces composed by Frederick the Great of Prussia.Brockhaus' Konversations-Lexikon. 14th ed., Leipzig, Berlin and Vienna 1894; Vol. 3, p. 456 Braune was son-in-law to German physician Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795‚Äì1878).

The economic focus tends to be on monetizing other scarcities, complimentary goods rather than the free content itself. One way to make money with copylefted works is to sell consultancy and support for users of a copylefted work. Generally, financial profit is expected to be much lower in a \\"copyleft\\" business than in a business using proprietary works. Another way is to use the copylefted work as a commodity tool or component to provide a service or product. Android phones, for example, are based on the Linux kernel. Firms with proprietary products can make money by exclusive sales, by single and transferable ownership, and litigation rights over the work. Internal use Businesses and governments can obtain value and cut costs by using copyleft software internally. See for example Linux adoption. Development By building on existing free software, businesses can reduce their development costs. With software that is copyleft, the business will then have the disadvantage that selling licences is rarely possible (because anyone can distribute copies at no cost), but the business will have the advantage that their competitors can't incorporate that improved version into a product and then distribute it without that competitor also making their modifications available to the original distributor, thereby avoiding a type of free rider problem. Copyleft enables volunteer programmers and organizations to feel involved and contribute to software and feel confident any future derivatives will remain accessible to them, and that their contributions are part of a larger goal, like developing the kernel of an operating system (OS). Copylefting software makes clear the intent of never abusing or hiding any knowledge that is contributed. Copyleft also ensures that all contributing programmers and companies cannot fork proprietary versions to create an advantage over another. The argument for investments in research and development for copyleft businesses may seem weak, by not having exclusivity over the profits gained from the result. Economically, copyleft is considered the only mechanism able to compete with monopolistic firms that rely on financial exploitation of copyright, trademark and patent laws. Distribution Commercial distributors of Linux-based systems (like Red Hat and Mandriva) might have had some ups and downs in finding a successful construction (or business model) for setting up such businesses, but in time it was shown to be possible to base a business on a commercial service surrounding a copylefted creation. One well-known example is Mandrake, which was one of the first companies to succeed on the stock market after the implosion of large parts of the IT market in the early 21st century. They also had success in convincing government bodies to switch to their flavor of Linux. However, excluding some notable exceptions like the Debian Project (which is expressly noncommercial and committed to free software on principle), most Linux distributors don't actively seek to limit their usage of proprietary software or restrict the proliferation of non-free licenses in connection with their distributions. There appears to be no real reason why an exploitation of commercial services surrounding copylefted creations would not be possible in small-scale business, which as a business concept is no more complex than making money with a \\"public domain\\" recipe for brewing coffee-- successfully exploited by so many cafeteria owners. However, there are few examples so far of SMEs having risked such a leap for their core business. UserLinux, a project set up by Bruce Perens, supports the emergence of such small-scale business based on free software, that is, copylefted or otherwise freely licensed computer programs. The UserLinux website showcased some case studies and success stories of such businesses.Case_Studies on userlinux.com (archived 2007) Art In art, making commercial services out of a copylefted creation is more difficult to do in practice than in software development. Public performances could be considered as one of a few possibilities of providing such \\"services\\". The music industry objected to peer-to-peer file exchanging software, but the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) gave some suggestions to resolve the issue. Objections to the appropriation of ideas for commerce believe intellectual works should not be compared to material property. Giving someone a physical object results in lost possession and control of that thing and can require asking for something in return, payment or barter. But when someone gives an idea to someone, they lose nothing, and need not ask for anything in return. Often copylefted artistic creations can be seen to have a (supporting) publicity function, promoting other, more traditionally copyrighted creations by the same artist(s). Artists sticking to an uncompromising copylefting of the whole of their artistic output, could, in addition to services and consultancy, revert to some sort of patronage (sometimes considered as limiting artistic freedom), or to other sources of income, not related to their artistic production (and so mostly limiting the time they can devote to artistic creation too). The least that can be said is that copylefting in art tends toward keeping the art thus produced as much as possible out of the commercial arena--which is considered as an intrinsic positive goal by some. Some artists, such as Girl Talk and Nine Inch Nails, use copyleft licenses such as the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- ShareAlike license that don't allow commercial use. In this way they can choose to sell their creations without having to compete with others selling copies of the same works. However, some argue that the Attribution- NonCommercialShareAlike license is not a true copyleft. Where copylefted art has a large audience of modest means or a small audience of considerable wealth, the act of releasing the art may be offered for sale. See Street Performer Protocol. This approach can be used for the release of new works, or can be used for the conversion of proprietary works to copylefted works. See Blender.

Eventually, the water reaches the ocean. Cheonjeyeon means Pond of the Emperor of Heaven. According to Korean legend, seven nymphs would descend from the heavens at night and bathe in the waterfall's pond. The falls are a popular tourist attraction on Jeju-do. The warm temperate forest around Cheonjeyeon Waterfall was designated Natural Monument No. 378 in 1993 because of the rare plants it contains and its value for scientific research. Rare plants such as the solipnan (ÏÜîÏûéÎÇú) plants or skeleton fork fern (Psilotum nudum) can be found around the falls in the crevices of rocks. Since ancient times, it is thought that standing under the waterfall on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month can cure diseases by the eighth lunar month, though swimming is now prohibited.

It is a colourless solid used as an ingredient in toothpastes. Cavity prevention Stannous fluoride was introduced as an alternative to sodium fluoride for the prevention of cavities. It was introduced for this purpose by Joseph Muhler and William Nebergall. In recognition for their innovation, these two individuals were inducted into the Inventor's Hall of Fame. Stannous fluoride converts the calcium mineral apatite into fluorapatite, which makes tooth enamel more resistant to bacteria-generated acid attacks. ; over time these react with sodium fluoride to form calcium fluoride, which is almost completely insoluble and thus ineffective for tooth protection. Stannous fluoride is a more stable ingredient and thus remains effective in strengthening tooth enamel upon longer storage. Stannous fluoride has been shown to be as effective as sodium fluoride in reducing the incidence of dental caries and controlling gingivitis. Stannous fluoride was used under the trade name Fluoristan in the original formulation of the toothpaste brand Crest, though it was later replaced with sodium monofluorophosphate under the trade name Fluoristat. Stannous fluoride is the active ingredient in Crest Pro Health brand toothpaste. Crest Pro Health issues a warning on the tube that stannous fluoride may cause staining, which can be avoided by proper brushing, and that its particular formulation is resistant to staining. However, any stannous fluoride staining that occurs due to improper brushing is not permanent. Stannous fluoride is also used in Oral-B Pro-Expert. Stannous fluoride is also readily available in over-the-counter rinses. Production SnF2 can be prepared by evaporating a solution of SnO in 40% HF. :SnO + 2 HF ‚Üí SnF2 \\\\+ H2O Aqueous solutions Readily soluble in water, SnF2 is hydrolysed. At low concentration, it forms species such as SnOH+, Sn(OH)2 and Sn(OH)3‚àí. At higher concentrations, predominantly polynuclear species are formed, including Sn2(OH)22+ and Sn3(OH)42+. Aqueous solutions readily oxidise to form insoluble precipitates of SnIV, which are ineffective as a dental prophylactic.David B. Troy, 2005, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, , Studies of the oxidation using M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy on frozen samples suggests that O2 is the oxidizing species. Lewis acidity SnF2 acts as a Lewis acid. For example, it forms a 1:1 complex (CH3)3NSnF2 and 2:1 complex [(CH3)3N]2SnF2 with trimethylamine, and a 1:1 complex with dimethylsulfoxide, (CH3)2SO¬∑SnF2. In solutions containing the fluoride ion, F‚àí, it forms the fluoride complexes SnF3‚àí, Sn2F5‚àí, and SnF2(OH2).Egon Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman (2001) Inorganic Chemistry, Elsevier . Crystallization from an aqueous solution containing NaF produces compounds containing polynuclear anions, e.g. NaSn2F5 or Na4Sn3F10 depending on the reaction conditions, rather than NaSnF3. The compound NaSnF3, containing the pyramidal SnF3‚àí anion, can be produced from a pyridine‚Äìwater solution. Other compounds containing the pyramidal SnF3‚àí anion are known, such as Ca(SnF3)2. Reducing properties SnF2 is a reducing agent, with a standard reduction potential of Eo (SnIV/ SnII) = +0.15 V. Solutions in HF are readily oxidised by a range of oxidizing agents (O2, SO2 or F2) to form the mixed-valence compound Sn3F8 (containing SnII and SnIV and no Sn‚ÄìSn bonds). Structure The monoclinic form contains tetramers, Sn4F8, where there are two distinct coordination environments for the Sn atoms. In each case, there are three nearest neighbours, with Sn at the apex of a trigonal pyramid, and the lone pair of electrons sterically active.Wells A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry 5th edition Oxford Science Publications Other forms reported have the GeF2 and paratellurite structures. Molecular SnF2 In the vapour phase, SnF2 forms monomers, dimers, and trimers. Monomeric SnF2 is a non-linear molecule with an Sn‚àíF bond length of 206 pm. Complexes of SnF2, sometimes called difluorostannylene, with an alkyne and aromatic compounds deposited in an argon matrix at 12 K have been reported. Safety Stannous fluoride can cause redness and irritation if it is inhaled or comes into contact with the eyes. At acute levels (over 2 mg/m3), if ingested, it can cause abdominal pains and shock. Rare but serious allergic reactions are possible; symptoms include itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing. When used in dental products, mild tooth discoloration may also occur; this can be removed by brushing.

It is a cytochrome P450 enzyme, which belongs to the oxidoreductase class, and converts cholesterol to 7-alpha-hydroxycholesterol, the first and rate limiting step in bile acid synthesis. The inhibition of cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) represses bile acid biosynthesis.  Evolution  Sequence comparisons indicated a huge similarity between cytochromes P450 identified in man and bacteria, and suggested that the superfamily cytochrome P450 first originated from a common ancestral gene some three billion years ago. The superfamily cytochrome P450 was named in 1961, because of the 450-nm spectral peak pigment that cytochrome P450 has when reduced and bound to carbon monoxide. In the early 1960s, P450 was thought to be one enzyme, and by the mid 1960s it was associated with drug and steroid metabolism. However, the membrane-associated and hydrophobic nature of the enzyme system impeded purification, and the number of proteins involved could not be accurately counted. Advances in mRNA purification in the early 1980s allowed to isolate the first cDNA encoding a complete cytochrome P450 (CYP) protein, and thereafter, results of many cloning studies have revealed a large number of different enzymes. Advances in molecular biology and genomics facilitated the biochemical characterisation of individual P450 enzymes: * The cytochromes P450 act on many endogenous substrates, introducing oxidative, peroxidative, and reductive changes into small molecules of widely different chemical structures. Substrates identified to date include saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, eicosanoids, sterols and steroids, bile acids, vitamin D3 derivatives, retinoids, and uroporphyrinogens. * Many cytochrome P450 enzymes can metabolise various exogenous compounds including drugs, environmental chemicals and pollutants, and natural plant products. * Metabolism of foreign chemicals frequently results in successful detoxication of the irritant; However, the actions of P450 enzymes can also generate toxic metabolites that contribute to increased risks of cancer, birth defects, and other toxic effects. * The expression of many P450 enzymes is often induced by accumulation of a substrate. * The ability of one P450 substrate to affect the concentrations of another in this manner is the basis for so-called drug-drug interactions, which complicate treatment.  Molecular structure  Cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase consists of 491 amino acids, which on folding forms 23 alpha helices and 26 beta sheets. Cholesterol 7-alpha Hydroxylase Rotation  Function  Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is a cytochrome P450 heme enzyme that oxidizes cholesterol in the position 7 using molecular oxygen. It is an oxidoreductase. CYP7A1 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is important for the synthesis of bile acid and the regulation of cholesterol levels.317x317px = Synthesis of bile acid = Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of bile acid from cholesterol via the classic pathway, catalyzing the formation of 7Œ±-hydroxycholesterol. The unique detergent properties of bile acids are essential for the digestion and intestinal absorption of hydrophobic nutrients. Bile acids have powerful toxic properties like membrane disruption and there are a wide range of mechanisms to restrict their accumulation in tissues and blood. The discovery of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) which is located in the liver, has opened new insights. Bile acid activation of FXR represses the expression of CYP7A1 via, raising the expression of small heterodimer (SHP), a non-DNA binding protein. 317x317px The increased abundance of SHP causes it to associate with liver receptor homolog (LRH)-1, an obligate factor required for the transcription of CYP7A1. Furthermore, there is an \\"FXR/SHP-independent\\" mechanism that also represses CYP7A1 expression. This \\"FXR/SHP-independent\\" pathway involves the interaction of bile acids with liver macrophages, which finally induces the expression and secretion of cytokines. These inflammatory cytokines, which include tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1beta, act upon the liver parenchymal cells causing a rapid repression of the CYP7A1 gene. = Regulation of activity = Regulation of CYP7A1 occurs at several levels including synthesis. Bile acids, steroid hormones, inflammatory cytokines, insulin, and growth factors inhibit CYP7A1 transcription through the 5‚Ä≤-upstream region of the promoter. The average life of this enzyme is between two and three hours. Activity can be regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation. CYP7A1 is upregulated by the nuclear receptor LXR (liver X receptor) when cholesterol (to be specific, oxysterol) levels are high. The effect of this upregulation is to increase the production of bile acids and reduce the level of cholesterol in hepatocytes. It is downregulated by Sterol regulatory element- binding proteins (SREBP) when plasma cholesterol levels are low. Bile acids provide feedback inhibition of CYP7A1 by at least two different pathways, both involving the farnesoid X receptor, FXR. In the liver, bile acids bound to FXR induce small heterodimer partner, SHP which binds to LRH-1 and so inhibits the transcription of the enzyme. In the intestine, bile acids/FXR stimulate production of FGF15/19 (depending on species), which then acts as a hormone in the liver via FGFR4.  Enzymatic mechanism  = Specificity = One feature of enzymes is their high specificity. They are specific on a singular substrate, reaction or both together, that means, that the enzymes can catalyze all reactions wherein the substrate can experience. The enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase catalyzes the reaction that converts cholesterol into cholesterol 7 alpha hydroxylase reducing and oxidizing that molecule. = Interactive pathway map =  Clinical significance  Deficiency of this enzyme will increase the possibility of cholesterol gallstones. Disruption of CYP7A1 from classic bile acid synthesis in mice leads to either increased postnatal death or a milder phenotype with elevated serum cholesterol. The latter is similar to the case in humans, where CYP7A1 mutations associate with high plasma low-density lipoprotein and hepatic cholesterol content, as well as deficient bile acid excretion. There is also a synergy between plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and risks of coronary artery disease (CAD). Glucose signaling also induces CYP7A1 gene transcription by epigenetic regulation of the histone acetylation status. Glucose induction of bile acid synthesis have an important implication in metabolic control of glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis under normal and diabetic conditions. CYP7A1-rs3808607 and APOE isoform are associated with the extent of reduction in circulating LDL cholesterol in response to PS(define PS, Plant Sterol?) consumption and could serve as potential predictive genetic markers to identify individuals who would derive maximum LDL cholesterol lowering with PS consumption. Genetic variations in CYP7A1 influence its expression and thus may affect the risk of gallstone disease and gallbladder cancer. One of the many lipid lowering effects of the fibrate drug class is mediated through the inhibition of transcription of this enzyme. This inhibition leads to more cholesterol in the bile, which is the body's only route of cholesterol excretion. This also increases the risk of cholesterol gallstone formation. Inhibition of CYP7A1 is thought to be involved in or responsible for the hepatotoxicity associated with ketoconazole. The levorotatory enantiomer of ketoconazole, levoketoconazole, shows 12-fold reduced potency in inhibition of this enzyme, and is under development for certain indications (e.g., Cushing's syndrome) as a replacement for ketoconazole with reduced toxicity and improved tolerability and safety.

The district boundaries extend from Butler Road in Spokane Valley east to the Idaho border, and from the Spokane River north to the foothills of Mount Spokane. The district operates six K-8 elementary schools; one comprehensive high school; an Enrichment Center that offers extensive early-childhood education, alternative education and special education; and a wide array of online learning programs that serve both residents of the area and many beyond. In addition, East Valley co-manages a vocational skills center with adjacent districts.About the District (Retrieved 28 March 2011)  History and development  East Valley School District was organized in 1886. East Trent School District #63 was the first school district in the Spokane Valley area, it was later developed with the EVSD. In 1888, the first public school house in the East Valley School District was constructed in the area now known as Otis Orchards. This one-room schoolhouse served the areas later known as East Farms, Moab and Otis Orchards. The Little White School on the Hill was built with twenty dollars worth of wood donated by William Pringle and was officially designate] School District #76 by the territorial legislature. Washington would not become a state until one year later in 1889. The more modern \\"Cobblestone School\\" (1909‚Äì1918) replaced the Little White School on the Hill and boasted its first graduating high school class in 1914. A new high school wing was added to the Cobblestone School in 1918. Cobblestone School, known for its tall bell tower, shake siding and field stone trim, was allegedly designed by famous local architect Kirtland Cutter. Cutter's other local designs include the Davenport Hotel and many other historic buildings which still stand in the Spokane area. In 1923, Stucco High School was built just west of Cobblestone School. When fire destroyed the old Cobblestone Elementary School in 1930, a second stucco building was constructed to house. With each new building, or as additional smaller school districts combined with the Otis Orchards School District, new school district numbers were assigned. Otis Orchards School District became #314 in 1922 after combination with the Moab School District. E.H. McHenry became their first official superintendent. Borden School District from Canfield Gulch combined with Otis in 1925 creating the new district #341. Schools in Newman Lake, Idlewild and Green Mountain also combined and joined with Otis between 1933 and 1938. In 1943, Otis was renumbered to Otis Orchards School District #348. In 1957, on a site just west of the old stucco schools, red brick additions of the new Otis Orchards Elementary began. Otis Orchards‚Äô public schools combined with the East Trent School District #63 in 1959 forming the new East Valley School District #361, Otis Orchards‚Äô old stucco school buildings were used to house high school students until the new Trentwood-area East Valley High School could be completed. The original East Valley High School opened its doors in the fall of 1960. Harold Hoffman, superintendent of Otis Orchards Public Schools, was retained as the first superintendent of the new East Valley School District #361.Brief History of the East Valley School District (Retrieved 18 April 2011) Schools in the district * High Schools **East Valley High School * Middle Schools ** East Valley Middle School * Elementary Schools ** East Farms Elementary ** Otis Orchards Elementary ** Trent Elementary ** Trentwood Elementary * Choice School ** Continuous Curriculum School ** Washington Academy Arts and Technology  References   External links  * East Valley School District Website * District Statistics - Staff, Students, Schools Category:East Valley School District Category:School districts in Washington (state) Category:Public school districts in Spokane County, Washington ","title":"East Valley School District (Spokane, Washington)"},{"id":"8042213","text":"Jubal Brown (born ) is a video producer and multi-media artist based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He gained notoriety in 1996 when he deliberately vomited primary colours on paintings in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Brown has made a number of videos, many of which have been screened in North America and Europe. Canadian Art magazine called Brown \\"the dark prince of Toronto art\\". Biography Jubal Brown graduated at the Ontario College of Art and Design, and is a founding member of the famefame media-art collective. Brown has made a number of videos that have been screened in North America and Europe. His works have been well received in London, and Canadian Art magazine called some of them \\"the most provocative and intelligent (and often very funny) video works to come out of Toronto in years\\". Many of his videos are made up of hundreds of brief samples taken from mainstream media, all packed together to create a \\"hyper-dense, jittery, relentless (and often deeply disturbing) audiovisual assault\\". Brown said that his intention was to \\"push the ideas of mass media to their logical and ridiculous conclusions: sex, death, speed, power\\". He believes that there is a lot of \\"useless information\\" in films, and his videos condense the material into \\"its one telling moment\\". He said that \\"our generation is raised on media and we can therefore eat a lot more, much more quickly.\\" The Blob (9 min) is a video Brown released in 2000 which includes cut-ups of the 1958 science fiction/horror film, The Blob, its 1988 remake, plus many other media sources themed on paranoia. Operation (1999) is a 10-minute recording of Brown performing surgery on himself. In the spirit of body-art mutilation, he attempts to remove a lump of fat on his torso with a pocket knife. When Operation was shown in London, many viewers had to look away, which is the effect the video set out to achieve. Life Is Pornography (2005, 23 min) includes clips of genocides rated as video game scores, stills of \\"horrible\\" images, like a picture of someone's eye with a nail through it, and a rework of fragments of the Britney Spears video, Toxic. A voice-over calls pornography the \\"reduction of human culture into exploitable parts\\". Mike Hoolboom writing in Practical Dreamers: Conversations With Movie Artists called Life Is Pornography \\"a deeply wounded, romantic and despairing tape\\". Brown released his longest video, Total War (53 min) in 2008. He said it \\"brings together a lot of the ideas, emotionally and technically, I've been developing over the past 10 years\\". The video highlights the media excesses that modern warfare evokes. Brown believes Iraq was the first \\"YouTube war\\", and Total War includes YouTube clips, network news clips, action film scenes, TV sitcom fragments, and other \\"found-footage\\". ArtUS described Total War as Brown's first \\"breakout work\\", with elements of streams of consciousness, in contrast to his previous fast-paced, trance-like mashups. =Controversies= In 1996, Brown vandalised two paintings in art galleries by vomiting on them. The first was on May 15 in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, where he threw up red vomit on Raoul Dufy's Harbor at le Havre after eating red gelatin and red cake icing. The second attack was on November 2 in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, when he ate blue Jell-O and blue cake icing and projectile-vomited in blue on Piet Mondrian's Composition With Red and Blue. Neither of the paintings was damaged and both were successfully cleaned. The galleries initially believed that the incidents were accidental, but in early December 1996, Brown admitted that his actions were deliberate. He said that they were part of a \\"performance art trilogy\\" entitled \\"Responding to Art\\" that targeted \\"oppressively trite and painfully banal\\" works. He said Harbor at le Havre \\"was just so boring it needed some colour\\", and he found Composition With Red and Blue \\"lifelessness threatening\\". The Ontario College of Art and Design called Brown's behaviour \\"reprehensible in the extreme\\" and issued apologies to the museums in Toronto and New York, but took no further action against him. Brown's intention was to attack three paintings, each with one of the three primary colours: blue, red and yellow, but he never completed the trilogy with yellow. In 2001 Brown defended a student at his bail hearing after he was arrested in Toronto for being one of three students who had made a 17-minute video of a cat being skinned alive and beheaded. The students from the Ontario College of Art and Design claimed it was \\"a work of art\\" and \\"a political statement condemning meat consumption\\". Brown said, \\"I don't support the killing of animals for food or art. But whether it is art is not for us to answer.\\" Selected videography Source: Practical Dreamers: Conversations With Movie Artists * Fuck the Black Hole (1997, 5 min) * Dead Museum (1999, 10 min) * Intimate Moment (1999, 5 min) * Operation (1999, 10 min) * The Blob (2000, 9 min) * Deathday Suit (2002, 8:41 min) * Speed (2002, 11 min) * Satanism, Just Be Yourself (2003, 6 min) * The Worst Ever (2003, 7 min) * The 6th Day (2004, 9:25 min) * The Blackness (2004, 15 min) * In Bloom (2004, 15 min) * Life Is Pornography (2005, 23 min) * We're in Heaven (2005, 33 min) * Party Tap #52 (2006, 6 min) * Total War (2008, 53 min) Selected exhibitions Source: Experimental Television Center * Images Festival (Toronto) * Canada House (London) * Art Basel (Switzerland) * Toronto International Art Fair (Toronto) * Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (Halifax) See also * Video art * Visual music References Cited works * External links * . * Jubal Brown's official website * Jubal Brown's video works Category:1970s births Category:Living people Category:Canadian video artists Category:Canadian multimedia artists Category:Artists from Toronto Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Jubal Brown"},{"id":"8042230","title":"Gi Talo Gi Halom Tasi"},{"id":"8042237","text":"Mount Hehuan (; also called Joy Mountain) is a mountain in Central Taiwan. The peak lies on the borders of Nantou and Hualien counties and is located within Taroko National Park. Hehuanshan is a popular destination in central Taiwan. The 3,421-metre east peak and 3,422-metre north peak of Hehuanshan are both higher than the main peak. Mount Hehuan is part of the Central Mountain Range (‰∏≠Â§ÆÂ±±ËÑà).  Recreation  Snow, rare in the rest of Taiwan, is relatively common on Mount Hehuan during the winter months. Highway 14 leads to Wuling, a saddle between the main peak and the east peak of Hehuanshan. At 3,275-metre, Wuling is also the highest point of Taiwan accessible by highway. From Highway 14, a trail leads to the summit of the main peak. At the summit, there is a weather station.  History  In the past, a military training area was built in the proximity of Hehuanshan. The mountain range also features the remains of a ski lift, reportedly used by Taiwan's elite during the martial law period and inaccessible to most people. The unreliability of snowfall has meant that the ski lift was abandoned years ago. Remains of the ski lift mechanism are still visible to hikers on the east peak trail.  Highway 14  Hehuanshan East and Main Peak at sunset from North Peak Highway 14 connects Puli, through Wushe (Ren-ai), and Qingjing Farm to Wuling. The narrow and winding road is considered a dangerous and difficult road. The road is often clogged in winter, when many locals travel up the mountain to see snow. Highway 14 is currently the only available road crossing the Central Mountain Range via the famous Taroko Gorge. The Central Cross-Island Highway, which crossed the mountains north of Hehuanshan, was damaged during the September 21, 1999 earthquake and closed indefinitely.

He was also known as Haim Pereira Mendes. Family history and education Henry Pereira Mendes was born into an old Spanish & Portuguese rabbinic family. His father Abraham Pereira Mendes was Rabbi in Birmingham, England, as well as in Jamaica and the Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island. His grandfather David Aaron de Sola was the Rabbi at Bevis Marks Synagogue in London, and his great-grandfather Raphael Meldola was the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of London. In addition, his brother Frederick de Sola Mendes also served as a rabbi in New York. He was educated at Northwick College (rabbinics), at University College (London). In Addition, he studied and graduated from the medical school of New York University, taking the degree of M.D. (1884). The degree of D.D. was conferred upon him by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (1904). On October 15, 1890, Henry married Rosalie Rebecca Piza, daughter of Samuel and Rachel Piza of St. Thomas, Danish West Indies. Rabbinic career In 1874, Rev. Mendes became Minister of the newly formed Sephardic congregation in Manchester, England. In 1877, he was called to the Congregation Shearith Israel of New York where he served until 1920, retaining the title of Rabbi Emeritus. As his successor, Rabbi David de Sola Pool, describes it: \\"The Rev. Jacques Judah Lyons, the venerable hazan of the congregation, was failing in health, and he passed away on August 13, when Dr. Mendes had been installed for only two and a half months. It was no easy task for the young preacher from abroad to fill the void created by the death of Mr. Lyons, who was bound to the congregation by almost forty years....But Dr. Mendes loyally continued the traditions....It is impossible to record the untiring affectionate personal service which Dr. Mendes at all times gave to the members of his congregation in joy and in sorrow...an inspiration to the bride and bridegroom under the canopy, and a stay of strength to those stricken by bereavement. He was a spiritual father to two generations in his congregation. However occupied or weary he might be, no call ever found him other than ready to respond.‚Äù In addition, to synagogue duties, Rev. Mendes served as professor of homiletics at Yeshiva Isaac Elchanan from 1917 to 1920. After retiring in 1920, he traveled for four years through Europe and South America. During that time, he reconnected with his first congregation in Manchester, and assisted them with Hebrew school curricula. Musical contributions Rev. Mendes also made musical contributions to the congregation. As Jewish music scholar Neil W. Levin explains: \\"Mendes also composed settings for the hazzan and choir of Shearith Israel, judiciously retaining the stylistic continuity of the Amsterdam Sephardi musical tradition and preserving its unique aura and melodic character, and some of these settings earned a place in the congregation‚Äôs permanent standard repertoire. Such is the case with his setting of uv‚Äônukho yomar, sung to this day at the conclusion of the Torah service after the Torah scrolls have been replaced in the ark, and his setting of Psalm 23.\\" Shooting On March 5, 1892, he was shot in the abdomen at his home by a beggar named Jose Mizrachee, narrowly escaping with his life. Years later, at the man's passing, Dr. Mendes paid for his funeral and ensuring a proper Jewish burial. Organizational activities During his long career, Dr. Mendes participated in the establishment of a number of organizations for the betterment of both Jews and non-Jews: * New York Board of Ministers - In 1881, he was one of the founders of the New York Board of Ministers and acted as its secretary from its foundation up to 1901 when he became president. * Jewish Theological Seminary - In 1886, Rev. Mendes joined Sabato Morais in helping to establish the Jewish Theological Seminary, of which he became secretary of the advisory board and professor of history. On the death of Dr. Morais, he became acting president of the faculty until the appointment of Solomon Schechter in 1902. * Montefiore Home - In 1884, the centennial of the birth of Sir Moses Montefiore, Rev. Mendes moved his congregation to convene the leading Jews of New York to mark the event by some practical work. The outcome was the Montefiore Home for Chronic Invalids, established in the same year. * Guild for Crippled Children - In 1896, he was made vice-president of the Guild for Crippled Children, and in 1901 established the Jewish branch of that guild. * Orthodox Union - He promoted the formation of the Union of Orthodox Congregations of the United States and Canada (1897) and was subsequently elected its president. * Young Women's Hebrew Association - He was also one of the founders of the Young Women's Hebrew Association of New York (1902). Zionism Rev. Mendes was an ardent voice in the striving for a Jewish homeland. He was asked by Theodore Herzl to spread the Zionist cause in America and became one of the founders of the Federation of American Zionists, serving as Vice-President. He was also a member of the Actions Committee of Vienna (1898‚Äì99). Following are some of his writings on the issue: * \\"The Solution of Zionism,\\" The North American Review, 1 Aug 1895 https://archive.org/details/jstor-25103563 * \\"Zionism,\\" The North American Review, 1 Jan 1897 https://archive.org/details/jstor-25119049 * \\"The Zionist Conference in Basle, Notes and Comments,\\" The North American Review, 1 Nov 1898 https://archive.org/details/jstor-25119100 * \\"The Hague Conference and Palestine,\\" The North American Review, 7 Sept 1906 https://archive.org/details/jstor-25105623 * \\"The Rejuvenation of the Jew,\\" The North American Review, 1 Jan 1897 https://archive.org/details/jstor-25118900 Books and articles Rev. Mendes authored books on a wide range of topics: Judaism, history, current affairs, and even fiction -- always with an ethical message. In addition, he was a prolific contributor to various journals. Together with his brother Frederick de Sola Mendes and others, he was one of the founders of \\"The American Hebrew\\" (1879). He wrote as well for the North American Review.

Opera News said that \\"Rescigno was a seminal figure in the history of opera in America, a maestro and mentor who shaped the destiny and reputation of two major U.S. companies ‚Äî Lyric Opera of Chicago and Dallas Opera ‚Äî as well as countless singing and conducting careers. Vigorous musical integrity, idiomatic style and unfailing support of his singers were the hallmarks of his performances throughout his distinguished career, which lasted more than fifty years.\\" Biography Born into a musical family in New York City, he studied with Pizzetti, Giannini and Polacco. He made his debut in 1943, conducting La traviata, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for Alfredo Salmaggi's opera company. He then toured the United States with the San Carlo Opera Company, serving as the company's music director from 1944-1947. He then took music director posts with the Connecticut Opera and Havana Opera. He made his conducting debut with the San Francisco Opera in 1950 conducting Lily Pons in The Barber of Seville and Dorothy Kirsten in Madama Butterfly. In 1953, Rescigno co-founded the Lyric Opera of Chicago with businesswoman and amateur singer Carol Fox and businessman Lawrence V. Kelly, serving as the company's artistic director and principal conductor from 1954 to 1956. For the company's inaugural performance he conducted Maria Callas in her American debut in the title role of Bellini's Norma. He went on to collaborate with the famous soprano several more times, including conducting her only stage appearances as Cio-Cio-San (Chicago, 1955) and her 1959 Carnegie Hall concert of Il pirata. In 1957, Rescigno co-founded the Dallas Opera with Kelly after the two left Chicago following a dispute with the Lyric board. He served as artistic director and principal conductor of the Dallas Opera from 1957 to 1990. While there he conducted the U.S. debuts of such singers as Teresa Berganza, Montserrat Caball√©, Pl√°cido Domingo, Gwyneth Jones, Magda Olivero, Dame Joan Sutherland, Jon Vickers, and stage director Franco Zeffirelli. He also worked with Callas in Dallas. He presented there the American premieres of Handel's Alcina and Vivaldi's Orlando furioso, the latter of which starred Marilyn Horne and was the first Vivaldi opera ever to be mounted in the United States. He also conducted the world premieres of Virgil Thomson's Fantasy in Homage to an Earlier England (1966) and Dominick Argento's The Aspern Papers (opera) (1988). He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1978, conducting Don Pasquale (with Beverly Sills, in John Dexter's production), followed by L'elisir d'amore (1980), L'italiana in Algeri (with Marilyn Horne and Rockwell Blake, 1981), and La traviata (1981‚Äì1982). He conducted at most of the major opera houses of Italy, and made guest appearances at Glyndebourne Festival Opera, Royal Opera at Covent Garden, Op√©ra National de Paris, Vienna State Opera, Zurich Opera, and the Teatro Col√≥n among other theaters. His close association with Maria Callas, having been one of her favourite conductors, resulted in several album recordings of operatic arias made for EMI, from 1958 to 1969. He also recorded an album of Verdi arias with Robert Weede (in 1953), excerpts from Francesca da Rimini (with Mario Del Monaco and Magda Olivero, 1969), and complete sets of Tosca (with Mirella Freni, 1978) and Lucia di Lammermoor (with Edita Gruberov√°, 1983). Also available, on DVD, are a 1959 concert from Hamburg with Callas, and a 1981 performance of L'elisir d'amore from the Met, with Judith Blegen and Luciano Pavarotti.

This area was known as Jeolla Province during the Joseon era. However, it is believed that the dialect dates to the Baekje kingdom. Like the Chungcheong dialect, the Jeolla dialect is considered non-standard. Pansori texts are written in the Jeolla dialect.Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, vol. 7, p. 935  Grammar  = Verb endings = In place of the usual -seumnida (ÏäµÎãàÎã§ ) or -seyo (ÏÑ∏Ïöî ) endings, a southern Jeolla person will use -rau (ÎùºÏö∞ ) or -jirau (ÏßÄÎùºÏö∞ ) appended to the verb. For a causal verb ending, expressed in standard language with a -nikka (ÎãàÍπå ) ending, Jeolla people use -ngkkei (ÏùëÍ≤å ), so the past tense of the verb \\"did\\" (\\"because someone did it\\"), haesseunikka (ÌñàÏúºÎãàÍπå ), becomes haesseungkke (ÌñàÏäπÍ≤å ). A similar sound is used for the quotative ending, \\"somebody said...\\". The usual verb endings are -dago (Îã§Í≥† ) and -rago (ÎùºÍ≥† ). Jeolla dialect prefers -dangkke (ÎãπÍ≤å ). Jeolla dialect speakers have a tendency to end their sentences with -ing, (Ïûâ) especially when asking a favor. This can be compared to the word \\"eh,\\" as used by some Canadians.  Tone  = Pitch and intonations = There are two major accentual patterns in the Southern Jeolla dialect: low-high-low and high-high- low. The use between the two is determined by a phrase's initial segment. If it has a spread or constricted laryngeal feature, the high-high-low pattern would be used while the low-high-low pattern characterizes all other phrases. These laryngeal features produce aspirated consonants (denoted with an apostrophe) and its use in determining accent patterns can be seen in onomatopoeia. For example, panchak (Î∞òÏßù) meaning ‚Äútwinkle‚Äù can be accented as so: L-H-L: panc' akpanc'ak ‚Äútwinkle twinkle‚Äù H-H-L: p'anc'akp'anc'ak ‚Äúmuch more twinkling than usual‚Äù In Gwangju, studies have concluded that there are three major accentual patterns: * The first is when the high accent appears only in the initial syllable. This accentual pattern is generally characterized by an initial long vowel syllable. For example, ha:n.kuk (ÌïúÍµ≠) ‚ÄúKorea‚Äù follows this H-L pattern. * The second pattern consists of two initial high syllables and it pertains to words with a tense, aspirated initial consonant. Words that follow this H-H pattern include tho.k'i (ÌÜ†ÎÅº) ‚Äúrabbit‚Äù and t'ak.t'a.ku.ri (Îî±Îî∞Íµ¨Î¶¨) ‚Äúwoodpecker.‚Äù * The third pattern, L-H, occurs when only the second syllable has a high accent and it applies to all other words such as ka.…Ør (Í∞ÄÏùÑ) ‚Äúautumn‚Äù and min.t…Ør.re (ÎØºÎì§Î†à) ‚Äúdandelion‚Äù  Pronunciation  = Vowel transformations = Regarding pronunciation differences, there is often a tendency to pronounce only the second vowel in a diphthong. For example, the verb ending that indicates \\"since,\\" -neundae, becomes -neundi (ÎäîÎîî). The name of the large city of Gwangju (Í¥ëÏ£º) becomes Gangju (Í∞ïÏ£º), and the verb 'to not have, to be absent', eopda ÏóÜÎã§, becomes very close to upda (ÏõÇÎã§). Other instances of vowel transformation called umlauting occurs in the Jeolla dialect. The word ‚Äúcaught‚Äù is ‚Äújaphida‚Äù (Ïû°ÌûàÎã§) in standard Korean, yet in the Jeolla dialect it is pronounced ‚Äújaephida‚Äù (ÏûΩÌûàÎã§). Because of the ‚Äúi‚Äù(„Ö£) vowel following it, the ‚Äúa‚Äù („Öè) vowel turns into an ‚Äúae‚Äù („Öê). This transformation occurs in several other words: * RABBIT: toekki (Ìá¥ÎÅº) rather than tokki (ÌÜ†ÎÅº) * MEAT: goegi (Í¥¥Í∏∞) rather than gogi (Í≥†Í∏∞) The standard ‚Äúo‚Äù sound changes into ‚Äúoe‚Äù due to the following ‚Äúi‚Äù vowel. = Short and long vowels = The Southern Jeolla dialect, unlike several other Korean dialects, has distinctions between long and short vowel sounds. There is a \\"vowel shortening rule\\" where a word-initial syllable becomes short when the word occurs non- initially in a compound such as saaram (ÏÇ¨Îûå) ‚Äúa man‚Äù of nuuns' aram (ÎààÏÇ¨Îûå) ‚Äúa snowman‚Äù or when the word is placed in certain non-initial positions such as: * i' (Ïù¥) ‚Äúthis‚Äù + saaram (ÏÇ¨Îûå) ‚Äúa man‚Äù becomes i saram (Ïù¥ ÏÇ¨Îûå) ‚Äúthis man\\" Short vowel sounds can also be replaced by long vowels causing a greater ‚Äòdragging‚Äô emphasis on vowels in the Jeolla dialect than standard Korean. The tendency is for ‚Äúi‚Äù sounds („Ö£) to be pronounced as ‚Äúeu‚Äù („Ö°), as in the word ‚Äúlie,‚Äù or geojitmal (Í±∞ÏßìÎßê), which is pronounced as geu~jitmal (Í∑∏ÏßìÎßê). In addition, ‚Äúe‚Äù („Öî) is pronounced as ‚Äúi‚Äù („Ö£) instead as it is in the word ‚Äúpillow‚Äù or baege (Î∞∞Í≤å), which is pronounced as bi~ge (ÎπÑÍ∞ú).  Geographical subdivisions  In addition to the north and south division, the Jeolla dialect varies between the eastern and western parts as well. Eastern dialects characterize localities such as Muju (Î¨¥Ï£º), Jinan (ÏßÑÏïà), Jangsu (Ïû•Ïàò), Imsil (ÏûÑÏã§), Namwon (ÎÇ®Ïõê), and Sunchang (ÏàúÏ∞Ω) while western dialects pertain to Okgu (Ïò•Íµ¨), Iksan (ÏùµÏÇ∞), Wanju (ÏôÑÏ£º), Gimje (ÍπÄÏ†ú), Buan (Î∂ÄÏïà), Jeongeup (Ï†ïÏùç), and Gochang (Í≥†Ï∞Ω).  Distinct phrases  There are some words that are unique to the dialect as well: utjeseo (ÏõÜÏ†úÏÑú) for \\"why\\", sibang (ÏãúÎ∞©) for \\"now\\", and dwitgan (Îí∑Í∞Ñ) for \\"outhouse.\\" Another notable word is geosigi (Í±∞ÏãúÍ∏∞), which is used as a placeholder name or a euphemism for embarrassing words, similar to the English ‚Äúwhatcha-ma-call-it.‚Äù Other specific phrases include exclamations used to express surprise or shock, such as Wamma! (ÏôêÎßà) and Omae! (Ïò§Îß§).  Perceptions of the Jeolla dialect  The general impression surrounding the Jeolla dialect include strong accents and fast speech.

Life and family Lady Anne with her mother in February 1934, by Bassano Ltd She was the elder child and only daughter of Arthur Wellesley, 5th Duke of Wellington, 5th Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo, and his wife, the Hon. Lilian Maud Glen Coats (elder daughter of George Coats, 1st Baron Glentanar). During her late teens, she dated (and was rumoured to be the fianc√©e of) Edward, Prince of Wales. In the winter of 1928, she was suffering from pneumonia whilst the prince was touring Africa, and he is said to have received coded radio bulletins in regard to her health. Rumours of their engagement were later officially denied by Buckingham Palace. On 23 March 1933, she married the Hon. David Rhys, younger son of the 7th Baron Dynevor. The couple had two children, Llewelyn Arthur (1935‚Äì2005) and Elizabeth Maud (1937‚Äì2001), before divorcing in 1963. Her brother, Henry, had inherited their father's titles in 1941. Upon Henry's death in September 1943, she inherited the Spanish Dukedom of Ciudad Rodrigo and the honour of Grandee of Spain (which had been awarded to her ancestor, the 1st Duke, and was able to pass through the female line), whilst the non-Spanish titles passed to her uncle, Lord Gerald Wellesley. She thus became the 7th Duchess of Ciudad Rodrigo, and her husband was styled as Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo. However, she ceded the dukedom to her uncle in 1949.

The timing of the recording nearly coincided with The Three Stooges receiving their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 30, 1983. This recording made #15 on the US Billboard charts in early 1984. In Canada, the song was simultaneously released by The Knuckleheads on Attic Records, while Jump 'N the Saddle's version was also available. The Knuckleheads' version was the hit in Canada, reaching #29 on the Canadian RPM charts. In Australia, both versions were issued, and both were minor chart hits.

That was however, the role assigned him by [the director].\\" \\"...Taylor's line readings sounded so frothily coy and cheerful, you'd have thought he'd studied with Billie Burke.

See: Atkol Video, p. 88. Bruce Wayne's directory of adult film lists 34 films. See: Wayne, p. 218. Atkol lists two films (Bi- Ballers and Studio X) which Wayne does not. A cast listing cannot be independently confirmed for Bi-Ballers by Adam Film World or Internet Adult Film Database (IAFD). However, although Adam Film World has no listing for Studio X, IAFD confirms the existence of the film and that Taylor is in the cast. See: Cole Taylor. Internet Adult Film Database.

She may be best remembered today for her performance as Cio-cio-san in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, having recorded this role complete in 1939 with Beniamino Gigli as Pinkerton. Career Born in Mogliano Veneto, in the Province of Treviso, she made her debut at La Scala at the age of 23 as Biancofiore in Zandonai's Francesca da Rimini. She was an immediate success, and her clear \\"nightingale-like\\" voice came to be highly appreciated throughout the world. Her best-known roles included the bel canto parts of Amina (in Bellini's La sonnambula), Lucia (in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor) and Gilda (in Verdi's Rigoletto). In 1922 she performed several parts opposite the tenor Carlo Broccardi at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo; including Cio-cio- san, Gilda, and the title heroine in Alfredo Catalani's La Wally. In 1924, fresh from triumphs in Milan and Paris, but before her debut in London or New York, she was engaged by Dame Nellie Melba to be one of the star singers of an Italian opera company that Melba was organising to make a tour of Australia. She proved a popular and critical success on the tour, and there was no rivalry between the ageing Melba and the much younger Dal Monte. Rather, they threw bouquets after each other's performances. In 1928, on her third visit to Australia, she married tenor Enzo de Muro Lomanto in St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. The wedding party created international headlines when, according to some sources, it gave the Fascist salute on the cathedral steps.\\"The Melba ‚Äì JC Williamson Tour of 1928\\", andrewsopera.blogspot.com, 17 July 2006; accessed 4 June 2015. This was disputed when the original article about the wedding was republished: \\"From the Archives, 1928: Near riot at opera singers' Sydney wedding\\", republication of an article from 24 August 1928 in The Sydney Morning Herald, 23 August 2020 On 12 January 1929 at La Scala she created the role of Rosalina, in the world premiere of Umberto Giordano's Il re. She retired from the operatic stage in 1945. However, she continued to work in the theatre (as well as to make the occasional recording) and appeared in a number of films, of which the best known is perhaps her last, Enrico Maria Salerno's Anonimo veneziano, a 1970 story about a musician at La Fenice. She became a singing teacher and coach; her pupils included Dodi Protero, Dolores Wilson and Gianna D'Angelo. Death Dal Monte died in 1975 at the age of 81, in Pieve di Soligo, as a result of circulatory disorders.

Members of The Singing Angels come from 7+ Ohio counties in the greater Cleveland-Akron metropolitan area, United States, and are ambassadors representing the best in Northeast Ohio area musical youth. After the first holiday season, The Singing Angels were in demand all year round and performed at programs including church fund raisers and business conferences in downtown hotels. The Lakeside Summer Art Festival became an annual performance in 1965. The group's first television special was made for Christmas 1967 at WEWS-TV and repeated in 1968. In 1969, the Angels had their first Command Performance at the White House. That Christmas, Wayne Newton introduced them to the nation on the Kraft Music Hall Special on NBC. The Singing Angels‚Äô first international tour was to Romania in 1974. The first rehearsal hall was in the Statler Hotel, followed by the old downtown Cleveland YMCA. In 1970, the Angels made the Cleveland Fire Training Academy their musical home. Today, they rehearse in the Cleveland Masonic Temple. The Angels have sung in over 30 foreign countries, starting with their first official tour to Romania. Subsequent tours included China in 1983, where the Angels sang at the Great Wall of China. This was in an era when United States visitors were strictly prohibited in the communist country. In July 2000 the Angels were the sole representatives of the United States at the World Fair Expo 2000, held in Hanover, Germany. The Singing Angels' signature song \\"Let There Be Peace On Earth\\" was heard in several pavilions hosted by other nations. The Singing Angels have been featured on national and international television, have performed four times at the White House and have appeared in concert with a host of superstars, including Bob Hope, Kenny Rogers, Wayne Newton, Celine Dion, B.J. Thomas, Roberta Flack, Eartha Kitt, Cathy Rigby, the U.S. Army Band, and the world-renowned Cleveland Orchestra.

Other highlights of Bill's career have included appearances as soloist with the Cleveland Symphony \\"Pops\\" Concerts; Singing Star of Chicago Theatre of the Air and tenor lead in the NBC-TV production of \\"Macbeth\\". In 1977, he was awarded the Ohio State Governor's Award \\"for excellence of achievement benefiting mankind and improving the quality of life for all Ohioans.\\" Bill was a Captain in the Infantry in World War II and is a past President of the Rotary Club of Cleveland. He sat on the committee that, with the help of non-profit consultants, forged the group's Long Range Strategic Plan, approved by the Board of Directors in November 2002. A ceremony during the Spring Benefit Concert featured alumni from each decade of the group paying tributes to him. The group has created The Singing Angels William C.

It was the first of five Abbott and Costello films to be directed by Jean Yarbrough. It was re-released in 1953. Plot Eddie Harrington (Bud Abbott) and Albert Mansfield (Lou Costello) are plumbers who receive a call about a leak in the private bathroom of Mr. Van Cleve (Thurston Hall), a wealthy businessman. The grumpy man, though his costume is ready, does not attend the ball but goes to bed instead. The leak is keeping him awake, but the costume ball that his wife (Nella Walker) is throwing downstairs is not. Eddie and Albert enlist the aid of a friend, Elsie Hammerdingle (Marion Hutton), a taxi driver, to take them to the mansion. While they are upstairs attempting to fix the leak‚Äîbut flooding the room instead‚ÄîPeter Evans (Kirby Grant), a guest dressed as a cab driver, mistakes Elsie for another costumed guest, despite her insistence that she really is just a cab driver. He winds up inviting her to another gala event, Mrs. Winthrop's (Margaret Irving) estate Briarwood, where a valuable painting, The Plunger (a heavy gambler), is to be unveiled. Mrs. Van Cleve was intending to send Eddie and Albert a letter of complaint for the devastation that they inflicted on her home. However, she is distracted for a moment while doing her mail, and instead sends them her own invitation to the unveiling of the Plunger at Briarwood. They think it is a reward for a job well done and look at it as a chance to meet other wealthy clients. Albert, being a plumber, can only think of a plumbing tool and is amazed at the value of the painting. However, a loan shark named Drexel (Thomas Gomez) to whom they owe money (they borrowed money from him to start their business and are balking at repaying him), demands they steal the painting while they are there. When they refuse to go through with the plan, Drexel and Marlow (Murray Leonard), a crooked chauffeur at the party, attempt to steal the painting themselves. When the painting is discovered to be missing, Gloria Winthrop (Ann Gillis), accuses Elsie, Eddie, and Albert of being the thieves. However, they clear their names when Eddie and Albert, in a fire truck, capture Drexel and Marlow and recover the painting. At the end, some guests claim that Eddie and Albert stole their tuxedos and the two are chased across a field.

Routines This film includes the classic Bagel Street scene‚Äîitself adapted from the popular vaudeville routine Floogle Street‚Äîduring which Abbott and Costello attempt to deliver straw hats to the Susquehanna Hat Company, but everyone they meet along the way has a reason for hating that company, including a lunatic who claims that he was killed on Bagel Street, and each of them destroys a hat until there are none left. This is followed by another scene where the two go careening down a steep street on a sofa, barely missing collisions, and causing havoc until the sofa lands in the river. Another classic routine at the end of the movie was the throwing of rocks to stop the boys in their tracks at a tremendous distance. The point of comedy was no one could throw anything at that distance to hit their target with accuracy. This routine was \\"borrowed\\" from earlier comedies such as Laurel and Hardy and later with The Three Stooges. Production Filmed from June 12 through July 21, 1944, with much of it being filmed at the Jewett Estate on Arden Road in Pasadena, California. Although Abbott and Costello made this film for Universal Pictures after they filmed Lost in a Harem for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, this movie was released first. Lou Costello had recently returned to work following a battle with rheumatic fever. As a result, Universal wanted to release this film as quickly as possible. To save time, much of the climactic fire engine chase was lifted from W.C. Fields' Never Give a Sucker an Even Break. Home media This film has been released twice on DVD. The first release was on The Best of Abbott and Costello Volume Two, May 4, 2004, and the second was on October 28, 2008 as part of Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection.

His next career was in Hollywood, as an actor, where he took on the role of Reverend Jerry Bedford on the 1960s television series Peyton Place. Hartley had minor roles in films with Cary Grant, Robert Redford and Clint Eastwood, and then in the late 1970s was cast in his own series, ABC's Chopper One, about helicopter flying police officers. The series was short lived, and thereafter Hartley moved to Aspen, Colorado, where he volunteered as the Managing Artistic Director of the local theater, and then turned to commodity trading full-time. In 1987 he became involved with Pavilion Communications Inc., a company designed to acquire smaller entertainment companies. Through this, Hartley learned of an opportunity to take over RKO Pictures. He and wife Dina Merrill purchased 51% of the company and merged Pavilion Communications with RKO Pictures Corporation in 1991, forming RKO Pictures, LLC. Their first major project was the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. As chairman and chief executive officer of RKO Pictures, Hartley has led RKO's worldwide development and production activities in movies and television as well as the expansion of the RKO brand to stage and other entertainment and distribution venues. He produced a remake of Mighty Joe Young (1998) with Disney, Ritual (2000) with Miramax, a remake of The Magnificent Ambersons (2002), and Shade (2003). For RKO Stage, he produced the musicals Never Gonna Dance (2003), Curtains (2007), Gypsy (2008), 13 (2008), all on Broadway, and Top Hat (2012) in the West End, winner of the 2013 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical. In 2013, he was appointed chairman of the board of Orbis International, a nonprofit eye-healthcare organization dedicated to saving sight worldwide that he has been involved with since 2010. Hartley belongs to a number of motion picture and television guilds and associations, is a board member of the Steadman Philippon Research Institute (formerly, Steadman-Hawkins Sports Medicine Foundation), and serves as director of the Harvard Business School Association of Southern California. He and Merrill founded the Story Project¬Æ to promote literacy among inner-city youth, beginning in the Santa Monica Boys and Girls Club. Hartley is also a frequent lecturer and is published periodically in business journals. He is also a published poet as well as a creator of stories for the screen. =Producer credits= Film *Barely Lethal (producer) *A Late Quartet (producer) *Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (producer) *Are We Done Yet?

The museum manages ArtsPost, a shop and gallery space for New Zealand art and design. Both are managed by the Hamilton City Council. Outside the museum is The Tongue of The Dog, a sculpture by Michael Parekowhai that has helped to increase visitor numbers. The sculpture was commissioned by MESH Sculpture Trust, Hamilton. Building and History The current Waikato Museum building is located at 1 Grantham Street in Hamilton‚Äôs central business district on the west bank of the Waikato River. It was designed by Ivan Mercep of the Auckland architectural firm JASMad Group Ltd (now named Jasmax) who later designed Te Papa. Waikato Museum of Art and History opened in 1987. The event was the culmination of years of planning and debate surrounding the need for a combined regional museum and art gallery. The name of the institution has since been changed to Waikato Museum Te Whare Taonga O Waikato, to better reflect and honour the local iwi (tribe) Tainui. The museum is situated on Ngaati Wairere land, a haapuu (sub- tribe) of Waikato, Tainui. Of major significance to the museum's history is the Kiingitanga (The King Movement). The museum is kaitiaki or caretakers of taonga tuku iho (rare and sacred objects). The interior and exterior of the museum building are inspired by and integrated with the environment. The design is oriented toward the steep riverbank on which the museum is situated. This approach is in keeping with Hamilton‚Äôs long-term urban strategy to enhance its river frontage. ArtsPost is located on Victoria Street next to the museum and occupies Hamilton‚Äôs former Post and Telegraph office. Designed by architect John Campbell, it was built 1901 for a cost of ¬£2,400. Hamilton City Council purchased the building in 1992 to create a high profile facility for the promotion of the visual arts. In consultation with the Historic Places Trust, the building was restored and ArtsPost opened on 27 June 1998. Exhibitions, Education and Public Programmes Waikato Museum offers a range of exhibitions (curated in-house and touring), as well as a full complement of education and public programmes. Waikato Museum‚Äôs education, collections and research, and public programmes have four area of focus: art, social history, science, and tangata whenua. The overall aim of the institution is to reflect the passions, history, heritage and culture of the Waikato region. Highlights for visitors include the majestic 200-year-old waka taua (war canoe) Te Winika and accompanying interpretation; Exscite and Milk Matters, interactive science galleries for children; and Te Whaanau Marama, a celebration of Maaori astronomy. In April 2015, the museum opened a major exhibition to mark the centenary of the World War I. Funded by a grant from the Lotteries Commission, For Us They Fell tells the untold stories of the Waikato men who served in the Great War and the families they left behind. The museum offers a range of events including artist talks, workshops and a popular school holiday programme during each of the four mid-term holidays. Since 2010, the museum has hosted Bat Tours, supported by the Waikato Regional Council. Participants enjoy a presentation before being led on a tour to the bat-nesting site and can have encounters with longtailed bats, glow worms, shortfin eels and other native species.

Early years Born in Evesham, Worcestershire, Lanchbury attended Cheltenham Grammar School, where he played in the First XI. After leaving school, he made a number of appearances for Gloucestershire's Second XI between 1969 and 1971. At the end of July 1971, he was called into the first team to open the batting in the County Championship match at Worcester, but although Gloucestershire won by an innings, bowling out their opponents for 58 and 88, Lanchbury failed personally, being bowled for a duck by Vanburn Holder. Despite this failure, he kept his place in the side for the next few matches, but his highest score from eight further first-class innings (and a solitary appearance in the John Player League) was the 38 he hit in the return encounter against Worcestershire at Cheltenham, and later in August a run of four successive dismissals for single-figure scores saw him dropped. He left the county at the end of the season and made the short trip to join Worcestershire. Sitting out 1972 was a frustrating season for Lanchbury as he made no first-team appearances, having to wait until the New Zealanders' visit to New Road in late April 1973 to make his senior debut for his new county. Play was possible on only two of the scheduled three days and the game was drawn, but Lanchbury made a handy 46 in the Worcestershire middle order. He ended up playing in another four first-class games that summer, as well as making two nondescript appearances at List A level. However, by the end of the year he was firmly back in the seconds, for whom he hit 132 not out against Glamorgan II in late August. The 1974 season held few highlights for Lanchbury, other than his solitary first-class half-century: 50* against Oxford University early in the season. At this point he was scoring consistently for the second team, and in mid-June he was recalled to County Championship action against Warwickshire, scoring 29 and 27 before being dismissed in each innings by Eddie Hemmings. He played a couple more first-team matches with little success, but he did make 97 in a minor match against the Canadians in July. That was the end of his county career, and in 1975 Lanchbury played in the Lancashire League as Lowerhouse's professional. Through the late 1970s and 1980s he also played a number of minor games for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Ireland and Scotland, but in 1984 he joined Wiltshire, and played for them until 1988. He played twice for them at List A level in the NatWest Trophy, as well as representing the Minor Counties representative side in two Benson & Hedges Cup games. He also made one final first-class appearance, for Minor Counties against the Zimbabweans at Cleethorpes in 1985; in this game he bowled the only two overs of his first-class career.

Their goal is to make music creators, and their music, a vibrant and integral part of human culture. Through commissions, grants, mentorships, performances, publications, residencies, and hosted gatherings, they provide innovative opportunities for composers and their music to flourish, and they link communities and composers through creation, connection, and engagement. ACF facilitates an ecosystem that reflects the diversity of our world, and they partner with a variety of creative musicians and organizations to develop generations of new music creators, performers, and advocates. Since March 2019, ACF has been working to center racial equity in all of its activities, including a public Racial Equity and Inclusion Forum that featured musical creators and collaborators at the Twin Cities PBS station in September 2019. The organization is currently undergoing a comprehensive strategic plan and transformation over the 2019-20 season to respond to the feedback and recommendations artists have offered ACF in its endeavors to both model and advocate for greater racial equity for music makers. By highlighting the individuals creating music through their unique stories and the impact of their art, ACF strives to demonstrate the relevance, vitality, and beauty of the musical experiences being designed and experienced across the country. Furthermore, they seek to shine light on those artists working on the fringe, the artists whose stories reimagine the word ‚Äúcomposer,‚Äù and the transformations made possible through musical experiences. ACF is committed to being a welcoming and inclusive place for creative artists across racial and gender identities, musical languages, and communities. History ACF organized in 1973 as a group of students at the University of Minnesota, led by co-founders Libby Larsen and Stephen Paulus, for the purpose of creating performance opportunities outside the academic setting. They incorporated in 1975 as the Minnesota Composers Forum and focused their early efforts on a series of concerts featuring the music of their members. In the early 1980s the organization expanded their services by launching the Jerome Composer Commissioning Program (1979), the McKnight Fellowships (1982) and innova¬Æ recordings (1983) ‚Äì all of which continue today. One of the earliest public advocacy initiatives was the Composers Voice program with Minnesota Public Radio (1993), a series of 13 one-hour broadcasts featuring prominent national composers such as John Adams, Meredith Monk and Philip Glass among others. In 1996 the Board of Directors adopted the current name of American Composers Forum (ACF) in recognition of its growing national reach. Eight chapters were established in major urban centers, and the 50-state commissioning program Continental Harmony was launched in 1998 as a millennium celebration in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts. Among its more singular historical programming was the First Nations Composer Initiative from 2004-2010 to support the unique needs of Native American composers and performers. BandQuest¬Æ, a series of music for middle school bands composed by prominent American composers, has reached an estimated 625,000 students since its inception in 1997. There are now twenty-two published works in the series ranging from Michael Colgrass, Libby Larsen, Michael Daugherty and klezmer revivalist, Hankus Netsky, to name a few. ChoralQuest¬Æ is the newest education program for middle school, with commissions from Stephen Paulus, Alice Parker, Jerod Tate, Jennifer Higdon, and Chen Yi among others. NextNotes¬Æ, the newest program, awards promising high school students with meaningful performance and mentorship opportunities. Over the course of four decades, ACF has nurtured the work of thousands of composers. The innova recording label has released over 600 titles, and our BandQuest¬Æ and ChoralQuest¬Æ series for middle level students has reached over half million students. New programs like ACF  connect offer direct connections and commissions with leading national ensembles. The organization has a rich history of granting programs, readings, salons, conferences, and residencies that support the creation of new work and connect composers to communities. Today, ACF has over 1,000 members across the country, including composers, performers, colleges, and universities. Members come from both urban and rural areas; they work in virtually every musical genre, including orchestral and chamber music, world music, opera and music theater, jazz and improvisational music, electronic and electro-acoustic music, and sound art.

It is the twelfth episode in the series, which was written Silvio Horta, produced by Salma Hayek and directed by Jim Hayman. Plot The show begins with a scene of Betty desperately trying to get onto the closed set of the live filming of a television show to see Daniel. She was apparently told that she specifically was forbidden to pass, and guards carry her away as she screams to Daniel, who is about to go on television. Then the screen flashes: 24 hours earlier... ...To where it all began, at MYW, where Betty, who just after settling into her new job and meeting another unattractive doppelg√§nger named Ruthie (played by Amanda's actress, Becki Newton), gets her first assignment from Sofia. She wants Betty to write an article about her experience of being an outsider at MODE. When Betty informs her that she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing an article like that yet, Sofia breaks down in tears and tells Betty that she feels this is where she loses Daniel...just like all of the other girls. She informs Betty that this is her chance to make it big and that she needs to get over to Mode and get started on the article. When Betty leaves Sofia cuts the act and quickly wipes away her fake tears. So Betty goes back to MODE to see Marc first and gets his feedback about his first impression of her when she came to work at MODE. He frantically cleans the office in preparation for Wilhelmina‚Äôs return. He shows her a screensaver collage that he has on his computer of his favorite Betty pics that make him laugh. Betty tells him that he had better delete all of those or she will tell everyone about his personal profile on a certain website. Betty goes to Amanda next for her article. Amanda tells her that she originally hated Betty for taking the position she had wanted as Daniel's assistant. Amanda then admits she has come to envy Betty's carefree ways. Amanda quickly comments, somewhat insincerely, that this doesn‚Äôt mean they are friends. At the Slater apartment, Wilhelmina and Ted continue to become closer and progress with their relationship. Ted brings out an obviously different side of her that her employees never get to see until today. When Wilhelmina arrives at the office, everyone is shocked to see her in a good mood. She was even nice to an employee whom she had just fired. She tells Marc that Ted took her shopping at an outlet mall and she was able to shop right alongside of fat people. Later Marc brings a delivery for Wilhelmina to her office and almost faints when he opens it. Wilhelmina is thrilled to find a stuffed armadillo that Ted has sent her. Meanwhile, at the Suarezes', Ignacio and his caseworker, Constance Grady, have a falling-out. He tries to get a new one but she returns to his home and stresses to him that she can‚Äôt just be gotten rid of like a pair of socks. Hilda suggest to her father that he should try being nice to her and maybe start by getting her a small gift. Back at MODE, Betty catches Daniel and informs him that Sofia was downstairs crying and that if he doesn‚Äôt want to lose her...he knows what he needs to do. Betty leaves MODE and grabs some lunch from a hotdog vendor. She sees Sofia exit a cab across the street and approach Hunter (her ex, who supposed to be in Europe). Betty hides behind the vendor and spies on Sofia while shoving down her lunch. She sees Sofia put some money in Hunter‚Äôs shirt pocket and hop back in the cab. Hunter then enters a male strip club (Called \\"Boylesque\\") and Betty runs back to MODE. Betty goes straight to Christina and tells her that she saw Sofia with Hunter and when she tells her about the bar, Christina suggests they investigate more since Christina is a frequent patron of the establishment. Wilhelmina and Ted have lunch and she thanks him for the gift. She tells him that she is now focusing on the important things in life...versus \\"hemlines and heels.\\" Ted informs her that he is carrying around a lot of baggage. She stresses that everyone has baggage, but that they can work through it. Wilhelmina goes to see the mystery woman (she brings photos of her and Ted, but our bandaged person is not interested as she throws them to the ground) and tells her that plans sometimes fail and that the attempt to take over Mode may not happen. She tells Wilhelmina that if she isn‚Äôt with her then she must be against her. Wilhelmina says to let the chips fall where they may and leaves. Daniel takes Sofia to his father‚Äôs house to have dinner with both of his parents. Claire introduces herself as his alcoholic mother and takes Sofia away to see some of Daniel's baby pictures. They finally sit down to dinner and Sofia is shocked to find out that Daniel's brother had died. They begin to talk about her life growing up and she informs them that she wasn‚Äôt raised with a silver spoon in her mouth...and that they could barely afford plastic ones. They later retire to the family room and tell Sofia that sometimes a marriage can be awful, but when bad things happen you realize that you could have never survived it without your partner. Daniel‚Äôs parents get up and begin to dance...Daniel and Sofia follow their lead. Claire tells Bradford that she does like Sofia, but that she thinks that she is hiding something. Unfortunately, Claire's instincts were right. Across town at the same time, Betty and Christina go to the strip club to find out more information about Hunter (\\"The 9\\") as he is known in the club. Christina gets sidetracked with all of the male dancers and Betty tries to keep focused on the task at hand. They finally get Hunter over to them and continue to tip him so that he will talk to them. Betty is startled to find out that Sofia hired him to play the part of her fianc√©. Betty immediately calls Daniel to tell him the news but before she can get it out, Daniel tells her that he has just proposed to Sofia. He thanks Betty for their talk earlier today because it helped him make the decision. Betty can‚Äôt think of anything to say but \\"congratulations,\\" and hangs up. Wilhelmina makes plans for her and Ted to go to the opera. She notices his bag on the floor and she asks what is going on. He informs her that he talked to his ex-wife today and feels that he must try to work things out with her. Though obviously hurt, Wilhelmina tells him that they probably never had a real chance anyway (what chance would a roadrunner and an armadillo have?) and lets him leave. She then numbs herself and turns back to her old attitude (She even ran into the same guy she had fired and asked him why he was still there after she'd fired him). After she returns Marc tells her that Steve, the private investigator who was working for Bradford but turned out to be a traitor, called, and she goes to answer his message. The next day at work when Betty approaches Sofia with her morning coffee, Sofia ask her where she got it...\\"Hunter‚Äôs crotch?\\" Sofia informs her that she hired Hunter because she had to keep Daniel on his toes so that she would not end up like the other girls. Sofia grabs her coat and tells her that she and Daniel are announcing their engagement on the air this morning. Betty insists that she will grab her things and head right down, but Sofia instructs her to stay there and finish the article about working at MODE. While on her way back to her desk Betty notices two of Sofia‚Äôs team members (Ruthie and a disabled person who describes herself as \\"Handi-capable\\") reviewing her latest article that has just been sent to press. Betty can‚Äôt believe the title, \\"Fling to Ring in 60 Days,\\" which the ladies tried to shield from Betty after she asked to see the advance copy. Betty then grabs the article from them and the chase is on. With Ruthie on foot and the other on wheels (in a wheelchair), the two employees chase Betty all the way to the elevator. The doors shut just in time and Betty is safe to read the article. She is able to see all of the steps that Sofia recommends (to get a proposal in 60 days) in her relationship with Daniel in a series of flashbacks of Daniel and Sofia's interactions. Betty rushes over to Christina and tells her that it was all a lie and hands her the article. Which brings us back to what happened at the start of the episode, as Sofia and Daniel are about to go live on the air when Betty rushes in. Security guards carry Betty out of the studio as she screams for Daniel. The show begins and Sofia tells the morning show hosts all about her new magazine. She tells them that she is also sitting there with the most notorious bachelor in Manhattan...and that she got him to propose to her in 60 days. Daniel squirms as Sofia holds up the article and tells the audience that they can do the same thing. Daniel admits that he was not aware that she was doing this, but that they have fallen in love. Sofia turns to Daniel and informs him that he is the one who has fallen in love. She takes the ring off and hands it to him. While all of Manhattan watches the television show, Sofia tells Daniel that she has to focus on her work right now. After the show ends Daniel tells Sofia that he can‚Äôt believe she did this to him. She insists that this is how he has treated numerous girls. She informs him that she had to do it and that this is how she has gotten to where she is today. She tells him that for what it is worth, he was so much more than she thought he would be. Daniel leaves the studio in a total state of shock. Betty tries to stop him to convey how sorry she is, but he doesn‚Äôt even notice her there. Bradford stands by Daniel at his house and offers to fire Sofia, but Daniel insists that the stunt that she pulled will probably get him the biggest launch of any magazine he has ever had. Sofia enters the office to thunderous applause from all except Betty. Sofia tells Betty that she does believe in her potential and that she sees a lot of herself in her. Betty hands her the article that she has written about working at MODE and tells her that at least the people that work at MODE don‚Äôt pretend to be what they‚Äôre not. Betty informs Sofia that she is nothing like her and tells her that she quits! Betty turns around and leaves. Ignacio makes his caseworker's day by giving her a little gift. She hugs him ecstatically and tells him that she hopes to be seeing a lot more of him. Ignacio sits stunned on the couch as she leaves. Amanda greets an unsuspecting Sofia as she gets into the elevator to leave for the day. When the doors close Amanda drops her cunning smile, and starts to give Sofia a vicious and brutal beating with her purse as the doors close and the elevator creeps slowly to its destination. Meanwhile, Betty goes to see Daniel at MODE, but Marc quickly informs her that he was last seen at JFK this morning and that no one knows where he is! Production This would be Hayek's last appearance in front of the cameras on Ugly Betty as Sofia. Although there have been rumors circulating that her character would return, producer Horta notes that the door might be open but there are no plans right now.From TV Guide (May 1, 2007) Regardless, Hayek did not make a return appearance on Ugly Betty. This episode featured Becki Newton in a dual role, playing Amanda and Ruthie. According to Horta, he told TV Guide that Ruthie will return in future shows.from TV Guide (01-17-07) However, this was not to be. Newton also provided the screaming voice of Marc when he sees the armadillo. In addition, a scene featuring Sofia and Amanda fighting in the elevator and then later exiting afterwards was deleted from this outing. The scene was among the deleted outtakes featured in the first season DVD. The website DudeCruise.com, which Betty mentioned in this episode, is a redirect to the official Ugly Betty website. This would be the first of several \\"websites\\" (set up by The Walt Disney Company) featured in the series that actually lead to the show, since the websites don't exist. The website mentions again in Secretaries' Day, when Wilhelmina and Marc at the Meade Building stairways, she admits that she was the one who hacks into his computer, and cancelling his subscription to the website, which angers Marc. There was a filming error in one scene. When Marc is opening the package containing the Armadillo in front of Wilhelmina, the ribbon on the package appears and disappears between shots. In the episode, Sofia mentions that Pen√©lope Cruz wants to play her in a movie version of her book. In real life, Hayek and Cruz are best friends and even Cruz has admitted that she would like to guest star on the show one day. This is the first of the very few episodes where the first act does not end on a close-up of Betty when transitioning to the title sequence. Instead, it ends on a close-up of Sofia. Casting Mark Indelicato, although credited, was absent from this episode. Music notes In the strip bar scene, the song played in the background is Michael Gray's 2004 Dance hit \\"The Weekend\\". Ratings The episode was watched by more than 13.5 million viewers in the United States, its third highest episode ever.From The Futon Critic (January 12, 2007) Awards Alan Dale submitted this episode for consideration in the category of \\"Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series\\" on his behalf for the 2007 Emmy Awards.

The soils were rarely examined below the depth of normal tillage. These chemists held the \\"balance-sheet\\" theory of plant nutrition. Soil was considered a more or less static storage bin for plant nutrients‚Äîthe soils could be used and replaced. This concept still has value when applied within the framework of modern soil science, although a useful understanding of soils goes beyond the removal of nutrients from soil by harvested crops and their return in manure, lime, and fertilizer. The early geologists generally accepted the balance-sheet theory of soil fertility and applied it within the framework of their own discipline. They described soil as disintegrated rock of various sorts‚Äîgranite, sandstone, glacial till, and the like. They went further, however, and described how the weathering processes modified this material and how geologic processes shaped it into landforms such as glacial moraines, alluvial plains, loess plains, and marine terraces. Geologist Nathaniel Shaler (1841‚Äì1906) monograph (1891) on the origin and nature of soils summarized the late 19th century geological concept of soils. Early soil surveys were made to help farmers locate soils responsive to different management practices and to help them decide what crops and management practices were most suitable for the particular kinds of soil on their farms. Many of the early workers were geologists because only geologists were skilled in the necessary field methods and in scientific correlation appropriate to the study of soils. They conceived soils as mainly the weathering products of geologic formations, defined by landform and lithologic composition. Most of the soil surveys published before 1910 were strongly influenced by these concepts. Those published from 1910 to 1920 gradually added greater refinements and recognized more soil features but retained fundamentally geological concepts. The balance-sheet theory of plant nutrition dominated the laboratory and the geological concept dominated field work. Both approaches were taught in many classrooms until the late 1920s. Although broader and more generally useful concepts of soil were being developed by some soil scientists, especially Eugene W. Hilgard (1833‚Äì1916) and George Nelson Coffey (1875-1967) in the United States and soil scientists in Russia, the necessary data for formulating these broader concepts came from the field work of the soil survey.Soil Survey: Early Concepts of Soil.

Fallou before his death in 1877 In his two books \\"First Principles of Soil Science\\" (1857, 2nd ed. 1865) and \\"Pedology or General and Special Soil Science\\" (1862) Friedrich Albert Fallou developed his collected field observations of soil into a systematic approach. He explained why soil formation was worthy of study and appealed for recognition of soil science as a discipline. In the 1862 work, he presented a proposal for soil profile description, discussed the physical and chemical properties of soils, and proposed classification of soils based on mineral properties. Vasily Dokuchaev is recognized today as more influential than Fallou, however in the years closely following Dokuchaev's death, Fallou was regarded as the founder of modern soil science by Dokuchaev's student, influential Russian pedologist Konstantin Dmitrievich Glinka (1867-1927). Fallou's historical status as founder is supported by Moscow soil scientist and bibliographer of Russian soil science, Arseny Yarilov, Editor of ‚ÄúPochvovedenie‚Äù (means soil science). Yarilov titled his 1904 article about Fallou in Pochvovedenie Friedrich Albert Fallou, Founder of Soil Science.  Vasily Dokuchaev  V. Dokuchaev with chernozem :The scientific basis of soil science as a natural science was established by the classical works of Vasily V. Dokuchaev. Previously, soil had been considered a product of physicochemical transformations of rocks, a dead substrate from which plants derive nutritious mineral elements. Soil and bedrock were in fact equated. :Dokuchaev considers the soil as a natural body having its own genesis and its own history of development, a body with complex and multiform processes taking place within it. The soil is considered as different from bedrock. The latter becomes soil under the influence of a series of soil-forming factors‚Äîclimate, vegetation, country, relief and age. According to him, soil should be called the \\"daily\\" or outward horizons of rocks regardless of the type; they are changed naturally by the common effect of water, air and various kinds of living and dead organisms.Krasil'nikov, N.A. (1958) Soil Microorganisms and Higher Plants. Beginning in 1870, the Russian school of soil science under the leadership of V. V. Dokuchaev (1846‚Äì1903) and N. M. Sibirtsev (1860‚Äì1900)Sibirtzev N. M. √âtude des sols de la Russie // Compte rendu: Congr√®s g√©ologique international, 7-me session, Russie, 1897. St. P√©tersbourg: M. Stassul√©witsch, 1899. P. 73-125: carte : 2 pl. was developing a new concept of soil. The Russian workers conceived of soils as independent natural bodies, each with unique properties resulting from a unique combination of climate, living matter, parent material, relief, and time. They hypothesized that properties of each soil reflected the combined effects of the particular set of genetic factors responsible for the soil's formation. Hans Jenny later emphasized the functionally relatedness of soil properties and soil formation. The results of this work became generally available to Americans through the publication in 1914 of K.D. Glinka's textbook in German and especially through its translation into English by C.F. Marbut in 1927.Glinka K.D. The great soil groups of the world and their development. Michigan: Edwards bros. 1927. 234 p. The Russian concepts were revolutionary. Properties of soils no longer were based wholly on inferences from the nature of the rocks or from climate or other environmental factors, considered singly or collectively; rather, by going directly to the soil itself, the integrated expression of all these factors could be seen in the morphology of the soils. This concept required that all properties of soils be considered collectively in terms of a completely integrated natural body. In short, it made possible a science of soil. The early enthusiasm for the new concept and for the rising new discipline of soil science led some to suggest the study of soil could proceed without regard to the older concepts derived from geology and agricultural chemistry. Certainly the reverse is true. Besides laying the foundation for a soil science with its own principles, the new concept makes the other sciences even more useful. Soil morphology provides a firm basis on which to group the results of observation, experiments, and practical experience and to develop integrated principles that predict the behavior of the soils.  Curtis Marbut  Under the leadership of C. F. Marbut, the Russian concept was broadened and adapted to conditions in the United States. This concept emphasized individual soil profiles to the subordination of external soil features and surface geology. By emphasizing soil profiles, however, soil scientists at first tended to overlook the natural variability of soils which can be substantial even within a small area. Overlooking the variability of soils seriously reduced the value of the maps which showed the location of the soils. Furthermore, early emphasis on genetic soil profiles was so great as to suggest that material lacking a genetic profile, such as recent alluvium, was not soil. A sharp distinction was drawn between rock weathering and soil formation. Although a distinction between these sets of processes is useful for some purposes, rock and mineral weathering and soil formation are commonly indistinguishable. The concept of soil was gradually broadened and extended during the years following 1930, essentially through consolidation and balance. The major emphasis had been on the soil profile. After 1930, morphological studies were extended from single pits to long trenches or a series of pits in an area of a soil. The morphology of a soil came to be described by ranges of properties deviating from a central concept instead of by a single \\"typical\\" profile. The development of techniques for mineralogical studies of clays also emphasized the need for laboratory studies. Marbut emphasized strongly that classification of soils should be based on morphology instead of on theories of soil genesis, because theories are both ephemeral and dynamic. He perhaps overemphasized this point to offset other workers who assumed that soils had certain characteristics without examining the soils. Marbut tried to make clear that examination of the soils themselves was essential in developing a system of Soil Classification and in making usable soil maps. In spite of this, Marbut's work reveals his personal understanding of the contributions of geology to soil science. His soil classification of 1935 depends heavily on the concept of a \\"normal soil,\\" the product of equilibrium on a landscape where downward erosion keeps pace with soil formation. Clarification and broadening of the concept of a soil science also grew out of the increasing emphasis on detailed soil mapping. Concepts changed with increased emphasis on predicting crop yields for each kind of soil shown on the maps. Many of the older descriptions of soils had not been quantitative enough and the units of classification had been too heterogeneous for making yield and management predictions needed for planning the management of individual farms or fields. During the 1930s, soil formation was explained in terms of loosely conceived processes, such as \\"podzolization,\\" \\"laterization,\\" and \\"calcification.\\" These were presumed to be unique processes responsible for the observed common properties of the soils of a region.  Hans Jenny  In 1941 Hans Jenny's (1899‚Äì1992) Factors of Soil Formation, a system of quantitative pedology, concisely summarized and illustrated many of the basic principles of modern soil science to that date. Since 1940, time has assumed much greater significance among the factors of soil formation, and geomorphological studies have become important in determining the time that soil material at any place has been subjected to soil-forming processes. Meanwhile, advances in soil chemistry, soil physics, soil mineralogy, and soil biology, as well as in the basic sciences that underlie them, have added new tools and new dimensions to the study of soil formation. As a consequence, the formation of soil has come to be treated as the aggregate of many interrelated physical, chemical, and biological processes. These processes are subject to quantitative study in soil physics, soil chemistry, soil mineralogy, and soil biology. The focus of attention also has shifted from the study of gross attributes of the whole soil to the co-varying detail of individual parts, including grain-to-grain relationships.  Guy Smith  In both the classification of Marbut and the 1938 classification developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the classes were described mainly in qualitative terms. Classes were not defined in quantitative terms that would permit consistent application of the system by different scientists. Neither system definitely linked the classes of its higher categories, largely influenced by genetic concepts initiated by the Russian soil scientists, to the soil series and their subdivisions that were used in soil mapping in the United States. Both systems reflected the concepts and theories of soil genesis of the time, which were themselves predominantly qualitative in character. Modification of the 1938 system in 1949 corrected some of its deficiencies but also illustrated the need for a reappraisal of concepts and principles. More than 15 years of work under the leadership of Guy D. Smith culminated in a new soil classification system. This became the official classification system of the U.S. National Cooperative Soil Survey in 1965 and was published in 1975 as Soil Taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys. The Smith system was adopted in the U.S. and many other nations for their own classification system. Another factor has had an immense impact on soil survey, especially during the 1960s. Before 1950, the primary applications of soil surveys were farming, ranching, and forestry. Applications for highway planning were recognized in some States as early as the late 1920s, and soil interpretations were placed in field manuals for highway engineers of some States during the 1930s and 1940s. Nevertheless, the changes in soil surveys during this period were mainly responses to the needs of farming, ranching, and forestry. During the 1950s and 1960s nonfarm uses of the soil increased rapidly. This created a great need for information about the effects of soils on those nonfarm uses.  Bioturbation  A major re- evaluation of soil formation and the role of biota commenced in the 1980s, as soil-geomorphologists began to re-evaluate Charles Darwin's and Nathaniel Shaler's early ideas on the role of bioturbation in soil formation.Darwin, C., 1881, The formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms, with observations on their habits: London, John MurrayShaler, N.

USSR and post-Soviet Russia  In the Soviet Union the national government established a nationwide free outpatient polyclinic system, where each health center covered a part of a city, a neighbourhood, and this system has been preserved in post-Soviet times. Each general practitioner (therapeut) out of some 10 to 20 working in each state outpatient health centre serves his patients on weekdays both in his room during his 3‚Äì4 reception hours and spends another 3‚Äì4 hours on house visits (which become most numerous during flu and colds epidemics and can reach 40 per day) on his assigned block of streets with a standard number of residents. Unlike Soviet times, however, each patient now has to produce apart from his citizen ID (pasport with place of residence stamp showing his registration on the clinic's precinct) a now uniform medical insurance policy of obligatory medical insurance provided by a number of medical insurance companies through either financing by employers for working people or by the state ‚Äì for children as well as old age and disability pensioners through regional funds of medical insurance. The purpose of such visit is primary diagnostics and prescription of treatment and mode of conduct as well as prescribing blood, urine and other tests to be carried out at the polyclinic The doctor also supplies the patient with a sick leave from work or study for a number of days and the leave is to be closed by the same doctor or his/her substitute and sealed at the clinic on the patient's recovery and checkout. If need be, the GP may arrange a visit to the sick person from one of specialist physicians from his/her clinic and of his/her nurse for giving injections. There are two identical state systems of outpatient clinics running parallel ‚Äì for adults and for children. With the rise of private enterprise since 1990, city dwellers may place a phone order for a house call from a private medical facility (to be paid for out of patient's own money).

History  The band received its earliest recognition in the mid-1990s by touring with My Dying Bride, Tiamat and Atrocity. Much like the latter two groups, the band had begun as traditional death metal, then evolved in an industrial music and gothic metal musical direction on later albums. The band received heavy rotation on MTV Germany, and made appearances at various extreme metal festivals, including Germany's Wacken Open Air in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2008, in addition to inclusion on Nuclear Blast compilation samplers. The band re-signed to Massacre Records in 2006 after a 10-year stint with Nuclear Blast; Massacre had been the band's first label. In 2013 they signed with Steamhammer/SPV to release their next album, Antiserum.

Similar standards exist for other network and card systems, with the USIM Application Toolkit (USAT) for USIMs used by newer-generation networks being an example. A more general name for this class of Java Card-based applications running on UICC cards is the Card Application Toolkit (CAT).ETSI TS 102 223 V9.1.0 The SIM Application Toolkit consists of a set of commands programmed into the SIM which define how the SIM should interact directly with the outside world and initiates commands independently of the handset and the network. This enables the SIM to build up an interactive exchange between a network application and the end user and access, or control access to, the network. The SIM also gives commands to the handset such as displaying menus and/or asking for user input. STK has been deployed by many mobile operators around the world for many applications, often where a menu-based approach is required, such as Mobile Banking and content browsing. Designed as a single application environment, the STK can be started during the initial power up of the SIM card and is especially suited to low level applications with simple user interfaces. In GSM networks, the SIM Application Toolkit is defined by the GSM 11.14 standard released in 2001. From release 4 onwards, GSM 11.14 was replaced by 3GPP TS 31.111 which also includes the specifications of the USIM Application Toolkit for 3/4G networks. Advantages * Some manufacturers claim that STK enables higher levels of security through identity verification and encryption, which are necessary for secure electronic commerce.SIM Toolkit * STK has been deployed on the largest number of mobile devices. Limitations Updating Android software is done over GSM where the SIM Toolkit may install automatically with new software regardless of automatic install applications. Change in applications and menus stored on the SIM is difficult after the customer takes delivery of the SIM and sometimes may be recognized as surveillance software. To deliver updates, either the SIM must be returned and exchanged for a new one (which can be costly and inconvenient) or the application updates must be delivered over- the-air (OTA) using specialized, optional SIM features. , mobile network operators can, for example, deliver updated STK application menus by sending a secure SMS to handsets that include a Toolbox (S@T) compliant wireless internet browser (WIB). When using a SIM card compliant to the BIP (Bearer Independent protocol ) in a BIP-compliant handset, the updates can be delivered very quickly as well (depending upon the network connectivity available to and supported by the handset, i.e. GPRS/3G speed). It might also be possible to change the menu of STK applications based on the Wireless Internet Gateway (WIG) specification.Gemplus to Deliver SIM Card-Based Solution to Oi For First GSM Launch in Brazil - Smart Card Alliance The update limitations hinder the number and frequency of STK application deployments.http://www.mygemplus.com/pss/telecom/download/GemConnect_online_sdk.pdf STK has essentially no support for multimedia, only basic pictures. The STK technology has limited independent development support available. If a mobile phone does not support SIM Application Toolkit, users may not be able to use the service or network correctly. Issues with several mobile network operators have been noticed on smartphones that don't support STK, like Nokia N900. In newer networks USIM Application Toolkit (USAT) is the equivalent of STK for 3G networks. USAT takes advantage of the multiapplication environment of 3G devices by not activating until a specific application has been selected, unlike STK which is activated at startup. Some functions are card related rather than application related.

All forms of human communication can contain fallacies. Because of their variety, fallacies are challenging to classify. They can be classified by their structure (formal fallacies) or content (informal fallacies). Informal fallacies, the larger group, may then be subdivided into categories such as improper presumption, faulty generalization, error in assigning causation, and relevance among others. The use of fallacies is common when the speaker's goal of achieving common agreement displaces observance to the soundness of the reasoning. The premise should be recognized as not well-grounded, the conclusion as unproven (but not necessarily false), and the argument as unsound.  Formal fallacies  A formal fallacy is an error in the argument's form. All formal fallacies are types of . * Appeal to probability ‚Äì a statement that takes something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might be the case). * Argument from fallacy (also known as the fallacy fallacy) ‚Äì the assumption that, if an argument is fallacious, then the conclusion is false. * Base rate fallacy ‚Äì making a probability judgment based on conditional probabilities, without taking into account the effect of prior probabilities. * Conjunction fallacy ‚Äì the assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them. * Masked-man fallacy (illicit substitution of identicals) ‚Äì the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one. = Propositional fallacies = A propositional fallacy is an error that concerns compound propositions. For a compound proposition to be true, the truth values of its constituent parts must satisfy the relevant logical connectives that occur in it (most commonly: [and], [or], [not], [only if], [if and only if]). The following fallacies involve relations whose truth values are not guaranteed and therefore not guaranteed to yield true conclusions. Types of propositional fallacies: * Affirming a disjunct ‚Äì concluding that one disjunct of a logical disjunction must be false because the other disjunct is true; A or B; A, therefore not B. * Affirming the consequent ‚Äì the antecedent in an indicative conditional is claimed to be true because the consequent is true; if A, then B; B, therefore A. * Denying the antecedent ‚Äì the consequent in an indicative conditional is claimed to be false because the antecedent is false; if A, then B; not A, therefore not B. = Quantification fallacies = A quantification fallacy is an error in logic where the quantifiers of the premises are in contradiction to the quantifier of the conclusion. Types of quantification fallacies: * Existential fallacy ‚Äì an argument that has a universal premise and a particular conclusion. = Formal syllogistic fallacies = Syllogistic fallacies ‚Äì logical fallacies that occur in syllogisms. * Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise (illicit negative) ‚Äì a categorical syllogism has a positive conclusion, but at least one negative premise. * Fallacy of exclusive premises ‚Äì a categorical syllogism that is invalid because both of its premises are negative. * Fallacy of four terms (quaternio terminorum) ‚Äì a categorical syllogism that has four terms. * Illicit major ‚Äì a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its major term is not distributed in the major premise but distributed in the conclusion. * Illicit minor ‚Äì a categorical syllogism that is invalid because its minor term is not distributed in the minor premise but distributed in the conclusion. * Negative conclusion from affirmative premises (illicit affirmative) ‚Äì a categorical syllogism has a negative conclusion but affirmative premises. * Fallacy of the undistributed middle ‚Äì the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed. * Modal fallacy ‚Äì confusing necessity with sufficiency. A condition X is necessary for Y if X is required for even the possibility of Y. X doesn‚Äôt bring about Y by itself, but if there is no X, there will be no Y. For example, oxygen is necessary for fire. But one cannot assume that everywhere there is oxygen, there is fire. A condition X is sufficient for Y if X, by itself, is enough to bring about Y. For example, riding the bus is a sufficient mode of transportation to get to work. But there are other modes of transportation ‚Äì car, taxi, bicycle, walking ‚Äì that can be used. * Modal scope fallacy ‚Äì a degree of unwarranted necessity is placed in the conclusion.  Informal fallacies  Informal fallacies ‚Äì arguments that are logically unsound for lack of well-grounded premises. * Argument to moderation (false compromise, middle ground, fallacy of the mean, ') ‚Äì assuming that a compromise between two positions is always correct. * Continuum fallacy (fallacy of the beard, line-drawing fallacy, sorites fallacy, fallacy of the heap, bald man fallacy, decision-point fallacy) ‚Äì improperly rejecting a claim for being imprecise. * Correlative-based fallacies ** Suppressed correlative ‚Äì a correlative is redefined so that one alternative is made impossible (e.g., \\"I'm not fat because I'm thinner than him\\"). * Definist fallacy ‚Äì defining a term used in an argument in a biased manner (e.g., using \\"loaded terms\\"). The person making the argument expects that the listener will accept the provided definition, making the argument difficult to refute. * Divine fallacy (argument from incredulity) ‚Äì arguing that, because something is so incredible or amazing, it must be the result of superior, divine, alien or paranormal agency. * Double counting ‚Äì counting events or occurrences more than once in probabilistic reasoning, which leads to the sum of the probabilities of all cases exceeding unity. * Equivocation ‚Äì using a term with more than one meaning in a statement without specifying which meaning is intended. **Ambiguous middle term ‚Äì using a middle term with multiple meanings. ** Definitional retreat ‚Äì changing the meaning of a word when an objection is raised. **Motte-and-bailey fallacy ‚Äì conflating two positions with similar properties, one modest and easy to defend (the \\"motte\\") and one more controversial (the \\"bailey\\"). The arguer first states the controversial position, but when challenged, states that they are advancing the modest position. ** Fallacy of accent ‚Äì changing the meaning of a statement by not specifying on which word emphasis falls. ** Persuasive definition ‚Äì purporting to use the \\"true\\" or \\"commonly accepted\\" meaning of a term while, in reality, using an uncommon or altered definition. ** * Ecological fallacy ‚Äì inferring about the nature of an entity based solely upon aggregate statistics collected for the group to which that entity belongs. * Etymological fallacy ‚Äì assuming that the original or historical meaning of a word or phrase is necessarily similar to its actual present-day usage. * Fallacy of composition ‚Äì assuming that something true of part of a whole must also be true of the whole. * Fallacy of division ‚Äì assuming that something true of a composite thing must also be true of all or some of its parts. * False attribution ‚Äì appealing to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased or fabricated source in support of an argument. ** Fallacy of quoting out of context (contextotomy, contextomy; quotation mining) ‚Äì selective excerpting of words from their original context to distort the intended meaning. * False authority (single authority) ‚Äì using an expert of dubious credentials or using only one opinion to promote a product or idea. Related to the appeal to authority. * False dilemma (false dichotomy, fallacy of bifurcation, black-or-white fallacy) ‚Äì two alternative statements are given as the only possible options when, in reality, there are more. * False equivalence ‚Äì describing two or more statements as virtually equal when they are not. * Feedback fallacy ‚Äì believing in the objectivity of an evaluation to be used as the basis for improvement without verifying that the source of the evaluation is a disinterested party. * Historian's fallacy ‚Äì assuming that decision makers of the past had identical information as those subsequently analyzing the decision. This should not to be confused with presentism, in which present-day ideas and perspectives are anachronistically projected into the past. * Historical fallacy ‚Äì a set of considerations is thought to hold good only because a completed process is read into the content of the process which conditions this completed result.\\"The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology\\", John Dewey, The Psychological Review, Vol. III. No. 4. July 1896. p. 367 ** Baconian fallacy ‚Äì using pieces of historical evidence without the aid of specific methods, hypotheses, or theories in an attempt to make a general truth about the past. Commits historians \\"to the pursuit of an impossible object by an impracticable method\\". * Homunculus fallacy ‚Äì using a \\"middle- man\\" for explanation; this sometimes leads to regressive middle-men. It explains a concept in terms of the concept itself without explaining its real nature (e.g.: explaining thought as something produced by a little thinker ‚Äì a homunculus ‚Äì inside the head simply identifies an intermediary actor and does not explain the product or process of thinking). * ‚Äì arguing that, if experts in a field of knowledge disagree on a certain point within that field, no conclusion can be reached or that the legitimacy of that field of knowledge is questionable. * If-by-whiskey ‚Äì an argument that supports both sides of an issue by using terms that are emotionally sensitive and ambiguous. * Incomplete comparison ‚Äì insufficient information is provided to make a complete comparison. * Inconsistent comparison ‚Äì different methods of comparison are used, leaving a false impression of the whole comparison. * Intentionality fallacy ‚Äì the insistence that the ultimate meaning of an expression must be consistent with the intention of the person from whom the communication originated (e.g. a work of fiction that is widely received as a blatant allegory must necessarily not be regarded as such if the author intended it not to be so).Wimsatt, William K. and Monroe C. Beardsley. \\"The Intentional Fallacy.\\" Sewanee Review, vol. 54 (1946): 468‚Äì88. Revised and republished in The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry, U of Kentucky P, 1954: 3‚Äì18. * Lump of labour fallacy ‚Äì the misconception that there is a fixed amount of work to be done within an economy, which can be distributed to create more or fewer jobs. * Kettle logic ‚Äì using multiple, jointly inconsistent arguments to defend a position. * Ludic fallacy ‚Äì failing to take into account that non-regulated random occurrences unknown unknowns can affect the probability of an event taking place. * McNamara fallacy (quantitative fallacy) ‚Äì making an argument using only quantitative observations (measurements, statistical or numerical values) and discounting subjective information that focuses on quality (traits, features, or relationships). * Mind projection fallacy ‚Äì assuming that a statement about an object describes an inherent property of the object, rather than a personal perception. * Moralistic fallacy ‚Äì inferring factual conclusions from evaluative premises in violation of fact‚Äìvalue distinction (e.g.: inferring is from ought). Moralistic fallacy is the inverse of naturalistic fallacy. * Moving the goalposts (raising the bar) ‚Äì argument in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded. * Nirvana fallacy (perfect-solution fallacy) ‚Äì solutions to problems are rejected because they are not perfect. * Proof by assertion ‚Äì a proposition is repeatedly restated regardless of contradiction; sometimes confused with argument from repetition (', ') * Prosecutor's fallacy ‚Äì a low probability of false matches does not mean a low probability of false match being found. * Proving too much ‚Äì an argument that results in an overly- generalized conclusion (e.g.: arguing that drinking alcohol is bad because in some instances it has led to spousal or child abuse). * Psychologist's fallacy ‚Äì an observer presupposes the objectivity of their own perspective when analyzing a behavioral event. * Referential fallacySemiotics Glossary R, Referential fallacy or illusion ‚Äì assuming that all words refer to existing things and that the meaning of words reside within the things they refer to, as opposed to words possibly referring to no real object (e.g.: Pegasus) or that the meaning comes from how they are used (e.g.: \\"nobody\\" was in the room). * Reification (concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) ‚Äì treating an abstract belief or hypothetical construct as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity (e.g.: saying that evolution selects which traits are passed on to future generations; evolution is not a conscious entity with agency). * Retrospective determinism ‚Äì believing that, because an event has occurred under some circumstance, the circumstance must have made the event inevitable (e.g.: because someone won the lottery while wearing their lucky socks, wearing those socks made winning the lottery inevitable). * Slippery slope (thin edge of the wedge, camel's nose) ‚Äì asserting that a proposed, relatively small, first action will inevitably lead to a chain of related events resulting in a significant and negative event and, therefore, should not be permitted. * Special pleading ‚Äì the arguer attempts to cite something as an exemption to a generally accepted rule or principle without justifying the exemption (e.g.: a defendant who murdered his parents asks for leniency because he is now an orphan). = Improper premise = * Begging the question (') ‚Äì using the conclusion of the argument in support of itself in a premise (e.g.: saying that smoking cigarettes is deadly because cigarettes can kill you; something that kills is deadly). ** Loaded label ‚Äì while not inherently fallacious, use of evocative terms to support a conclusion is a type of begging the question fallacy. When fallaciously used, the term's connotations are relied on to sway the argument towards a particular conclusion. For example, an organic foods advertisement that says \\"Organic foods are safe and healthy foods grown without any pesticides, herbicides, or other unhealthy additives.\\" Use of the term \\"unhealthy additives\\" is used as support for the idea that the product is safe. * Circular reasoning (') ‚Äì the reasoner begins with what he or she is trying to end up with (e.g.: all bachelors are unmarried males). * Fallacy of many questions (complex question, fallacy of presuppositions, loaded question, ') ‚Äì someone asks a question that presupposes something that has not been proven or accepted by all the people involved. This fallacy is often used rhetorically so that the question limits direct replies to those that serve the questioner's agenda. = Faulty generalizations = Faulty generalization ‚Äì reaching a conclusion from weak premises. * Accident ‚Äì an exception to a generalization is ignored. ** No true Scotsman ‚Äì makes a generalization true by changing the generalization to exclude a counterexample. * Cherry picking (suppressed evidence, incomplete evidence) ‚Äì using individual cases or data that confirm a particular position, while ignoring related cases or data that may contradict that position. ** Survivorship bias ‚Äì a small number of successes of a given process are actively promoted while completely ignoring a large number of failures * False analogy ‚Äì an argument by analogy in which the analogy is poorly suited. * Hasty generalization (fallacy of insufficient statistics, fallacy of insufficient sample, fallacy of the lonely fact, hasty induction, secundum quid, converse accident, jumping to conclusions) ‚Äì basing a broad conclusion on a small or unrepresentative sample. * Inductive fallacy ‚Äì A more general name to some fallacies, such as hasty generalization. It happens when a conclusion is made of premises that lightly support it. * Misleading vividness ‚Äì involves describing an occurrence in vivid detail, even if it is an exceptional occurrence, to convince someone that it is a problem; this also relies on the appeal to emotion fallacy. * Nut Picking (suppressed evidence, incomplete evidence) ‚Äì using individual cases or data that falsifies a particular position, while ignoring related cases or data that may support. Named in contrast to Cherry Picking. * Overwhelming exception ‚Äì an accurate generalization that comes with qualifications that eliminate so many cases that what remains is much less impressive than the initial statement might have led one to assume. * Thought-terminating clich√© ‚Äì a commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom, used to quell cognitive dissonance, conceal lack of forethought, move on to other topics, etc. ‚Äì but in any case, to end the debate with a clich√© rather than a point. = Questionable cause = Questionable cause is a general type of error with many variants. Its primary basis is the confusion of association with causation, either by inappropriately deducing (or rejecting) causation or a broader failure to properly investigate the cause of an observed effect. * ' (Latin for \\"with this, therefore because of this\\"; correlation implies causation; faulty cause/effect, coincidental correlation, correlation without causation) ‚Äì a faulty assumption that, because there is a correlation between two variables, one caused the other. ** ' (Latin for \\"after this, therefore because of this\\"; temporal sequence implies causation) ‚Äì X happened, then Y happened; therefore X caused Y. ** Wrong direction (reverse causation) ‚Äì cause and effect are reversed. The cause is said to be the effect and vice versa. The consequence of the phenomenon is claimed to be its root cause. ** Ignoring a common cause * Fallacy of the single cause (causal oversimplification) ‚Äì it is assumed that there is one, simple cause of an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes. * Furtive fallacy ‚Äì outcomes are asserted to have been caused by the malfeasance of decision makers. * Gambler's fallacy ‚Äì the incorrect belief that separate, independent events can affect the likelihood of another random event. If a fair coin lands on heads 10 times in a row, the belief that it is \\"due to the number of times it had previously landed on tails\\" is incorrect. ** Inverse gambler's fallacy * Magical thinking ‚Äì fallacious attribution of causal relationships between actions and events. In anthropology, it refers primarily to cultural beliefs that ritual, prayer, sacrifice, and taboos will produce specific supernatural consequences. In psychology, it refers to an irrational belief that thoughts by themselves can affect the world or that thinking something corresponds with doing it. * Regression fallacy ‚Äì ascribes cause where none exists. The flaw is failing to account for natural fluctuations. It is frequently a special kind of post hoc fallacy. = Relevance fallacies = * Appeal to the stone (') ‚Äì dismissing a claim as absurd without demonstrating proof for its absurdity. * Argument from ignorance (appeal to ignorance, argumentum ad ignorantiam) ‚Äì assuming that a claim is true because it has not been or cannot be proven false, or vice versa. * Argument from incredulity (appeal to common sense) ‚Äì \\"I cannot imagine how this could be true; therefore, it must be false.\\" * Argument from repetition (', ') ‚Äì repeating an argument until nobody cares to discuss it any more; sometimes confused with proof by assertion * Argument from silence (') ‚Äì assuming that a claim is true based on the absence of textual or spoken evidence from an authoritative source, or vice versa. * Ignoratio elenchi (irrelevant conclusion, missing the point) ‚Äì an argument that may in itself be valid, but does not address the issue in question.  Red herring fallacies  A red herring fallacy, one of the main subtypes of fallacies of relevance, is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion. Red herring ‚Äì introducing a second argument in response to the first argument that is irrelevant and draws attention away from the original topic (e.g.: saying ‚ÄúIf you want to complain about the dishes I leave in the sink, what about the dirty clothes you leave in the bathroom?‚Äù). See also irrelevant conclusion. * ' ‚Äì attacking the arguer instead of the argument. (N.b., \\"ad hominem\\" can also refer to the dialectical strategy of arguing on the basis of the opponent's own commitments. This type of ad hominem is not a fallacy.) **Circumstantial ad hominem ‚Äì stating that the arguer's personal situation or perceived benefit from advancing a conclusion means that their conclusion is wrong. ** Poisoning the well ‚Äì a subtype of ' presenting adverse information about a target person with the intention of discrediting everything that the target person says. ** Appeal to motive ‚Äì dismissing an idea by questioning the motives of its proposer. ** ‚Äì a sophistical and unfalsifiable form of argument that attempts to overcome an opponent by inducing a sense of guilt and using the opponent's denial of guilt as further evidence of guilt. ** Tone policing ‚Äì focusing on emotion behind (or resulting from) a message rather than the message itself as a discrediting tactic. ** Traitorous critic fallacy (', 'thus leave') ‚Äì a critic's perceived affiliation is portrayed as the underlying reason for the criticism and the critic is asked to stay away from the issue altogether. Easily confused with the association fallacy (\\"guilt by association\\") below. * Appeal to authority (argument from authority, ') ‚Äì an assertion is deemed true because of the position or authority of the person asserting it. ** Appeal to accomplishment ‚Äì an assertion is deemed true or false based on the accomplishments of the proposer. This may often also have elements of appeal to emotion (see below). ** Courtier's reply ‚Äì a criticism is dismissed by claiming that the critic lacks sufficient knowledge, credentials, or training to credibly comment on the subject matter. * Appeal to consequences (') ‚Äì the conclusion is supported by a premise that asserts positive or negative consequences from some course of action in an attempt to distract from the initial discussion. * Appeal to emotion ‚Äì manipulating the emotions of the listener rather than using valid reasoning to obtain common agreement. ** Appeal to fear ‚Äì generating distress, anxiety, cynicism, or prejudice towards the opponent in an argument ** Appeal to flattery ‚Äì using excessive or insincere praise to obtain common agreement. ** Appeal to pity (') ‚Äì generating feelings of sympathy or mercy in the listener to obtain common agreement. ** Appeal to ridicule (') ‚Äì stating that the opponent's position would lead to an absurdity or contradiction. ** Appeal to spite ‚Äì generating bitterness or hostility in the listener toward an opponent in an argument. ** Judgmental language ‚Äì using insulting or pejorative language in an argument. ** Pooh-pooh ‚Äì stating that an opponent's argument is unworthy of consideration. ** Wishful thinking ‚Äì arguing for a course of action by the listener according to what might be pleasing to imagine rather than according to evidence or reason. * Appeal to nature ‚Äì judgment is based solely on whether the subject of judgment is 'natural' or 'unnatural'. (Sometimes also called the \\"naturalistic fallacy\\", but is not to be confused with the other fallacies by that name.) * Appeal to novelty (', ') ‚Äì a proposal is claimed to be superior or better solely because it is new or modern. (opposite of appeal to tradition) * Appeal to poverty (') ‚Äì supporting a conclusion because the arguer is poor (or refuting because the arguer is wealthy). (Opposite of appeal to wealth.) * Appeal to tradition (') ‚Äì a conclusion supported solely because it has long been held to be true. * Appeal to wealth (') ‚Äì supporting a conclusion because the arguer is wealthy (or refuting because the arguer is poor). (Sometimes taken together with the appeal to poverty as a general appeal to the arguer's financial situation.) * ' (appeal to the stick, appeal to force, appeal to threat) ‚Äì an argument made through coercion or threats of force to support position. * ' (appeal to widespread belief, bandwagon argument, appeal to the majority, appeal to the people) ‚Äì a proposition is claimed to be true or good solely because a majority or many people believe it to be so. * Association fallacy (guilt by association and honor by association) ‚Äì arguing that because two things share (or are implied to share) some property, they are the same. * (bare assertion fallacy) ‚Äì a claim that is presented as true without support, as self- evidently true, or as dogmatically true. This fallacy relies on the implied expertise of the speaker or on an unstated truism.Whitney, William Dwight. (1906). \\"Ipse dixit\\", The Century dictionary and cyclopedia, pp. 379‚Äì380; Westbrook, Robert B. \\"John Dewey and American Democracy\\", p. 359.VanderMey, Randall et al. (2011). Comp, p. 183; excerpt: \\"Bare assertion. The most basic way to distort an issue is to deny that it exists. This fallacy claims, 'That's just how it is.' \\" * Bulverism (psychogenetic fallacy) ‚Äì inferring why an argument is being used, associating it to some psychological reason, then assuming it is invalid as a result. The assumption that if the origin of an idea comes from a biased mind, then the idea itself must also be a falsehood. * Chronological snobbery ‚Äì a thesis is deemed incorrect because it was commonly held when something else, known to be false, was also commonly held. * (also known as \\"appeal to worse problems\\" or \\"not as bad as\\") ‚Äì dismissing an argument or complaint due to what are perceived to be more important problems. First World problems are a subset of this fallacy. * Genetic fallacy ‚Äì a conclusion is suggested based solely on something or someone's origin rather than its current meaning or context. * I'm entitled to my opinion ‚Äì a person discredits any opposition by claiming that they are entitled to their opinion. * Moralistic fallacy ‚Äì inferring factual conclusions from evaluative premises, in violation of fact-value distinction; e.g. making statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. This is the inverse of the naturalistic fallacy. * Naturalistic fallacy ‚Äì inferring evaluative conclusions from purely factual premises in violation of fact-value distinction. Naturalistic fallacy (sometimes confused with appeal to nature) is the inverse of moralistic fallacy. ** Is‚Äìought fallacy ‚Äì statements about what is, on the basis of claims about what ought to be. * John Searle, \\"How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'\\", The Philosophical Review, 73:1 (January 1964), 43‚Äì58 (anti-naturalistic fallacy)Alex Walter, \\"The Anti-naturalistic Fallacy: Evolutionary Moral Psychology and the Insistence of Brute Facts\\", Evolutionary Psychology, 4 (2006), 33‚Äì48 ‚Äì inferring an impossibility to infer any instance of ought from is from the general invalidity of is-ought fallacy, mentioned above. For instance, is P \\\\lor eg P does imply ought P \\\\lor eg P for any proposition P, although the naturalistic fallacy fallacy would falsely declare such an inference invalid. Naturalistic fallacy fallacy is a type of argument from fallacy. * Straw man fallacy ‚Äì misrepresenting an opponent's argument by broadening or narrowing the scope of a premise and refuting a weaker version (e.g.: saying ‚ÄúYou tell us that A is the right thing to do, but the real reason you want us to do A is that you would personally profit from it). * Texas sharpshooter fallacy ‚Äì improperly asserting a cause to explain a cluster of data. * Tu quoque ('you too' ‚Äì appeal to hypocrisy, whataboutism) ‚Äì stating that a position is false, wrong, or should be disregarded because its proponent fails to act consistently in accordance with it. * Two wrongs make a right ‚Äì assuming that, if one wrong is committed, another wrong will rectify it. * Vacuous truth ‚Äì a claim that is technically true but meaningless, in the form no A in B has C, when there is no A in B.

The SAIA 90 was the last stage of the ACA (Avi√≥n Caza Argentino) project, which was started by the National Reorganization Process to develop an Argentine fighter aircraft. The three stages of the project were: * The FMA IA 63 Pampa, a trainer/attack aircraft, which was the only of the three to reach production. The Vought Pampa 2000 version was entered into the US JPATS competition in the 1990s but lost to the T-6 Texan II. * The IA 67 Cordoba, a light attack bomber project that remained unbuilt. * The SAIA 90, an air superiority aircraft with \\"stealth\\" characteristics (including a small radar cross-section).  History  By 1980 the Fabrica Militar de Aviones and Dornier had an ongoing relationship as a result of the combined development of the IA 63, and both were considered a cooperative agreement for the production of future airplanes. This agreement called to both parties to establish a common office in the city of C√≥rdoba, Argentina within the year for the production, marketing and associated support services of their products. The development of a trainer was the first of three steps in F√°brica Argentina de Aviones' strategy, elaborated after the development of the IA 58 Pucar√° by the mid-1960s. The steps of this strategy included the Pampa, a light transport and a combat aircraft. The German maker produced a series of preliminary designs, which contemplated various aspects for a combat aircraft, which the air force could then adopt to its own requirements. Description The Dornier studies included analyses of the basic requirements, including air combat under anticipated operative conditions, and taking into account the characteristics of likely weapons. SAIA 90 from below According to the analysis the aircraft should be capable of a sustained maneuvering speed of Mach 0.9 at an altitude of 6000 m; quick acceleration from Mach 0.9 to 1.5 at 9000 m, high deceleration, independent of the relative speed; reasonable combat autonomy with integral fuel tanks; and minimal radar and infrared signatures (Stealth). Possible armament included: *1 Mauser 27mm gun with 150 rounds. *2 AAM InfraRed (AIM-9 Sidewinder class) *4 AAM radar-guided (AIM-120 AMRAAM class). *Up to 5000 kg of air-to-surface munitions. = The avionics = The air-to-air radar was to be able to detect a 5 m2 target at a distance of 90 km without being detected by enemy ECM, and track 6 targets that could be identified with IFF. For air-to-ground attacks, the radar was to be able to map the terrain. = Configuration = Although it was desirable to achieve a combination of the advantages that a heavily loaded delta wing with low weight offers; the trans-sonic/subsonic turn rate, longitudinal stability and short field characteristics desired were impossible to combine into a single wing design. The opposing solution of commitment for the pattern, was the continuation of the border of attack of the wings that generated a vortex of high energy and it improved the aerodynamic yield notably in big angles of incidence. Another characteristic of the design was the artificial longitudinal stability that allowed equilibrating the airplane by means of the application of positive forces on the line planes. This way a direct wing was configured with big arrow angles, continuations in the union wing-fuselage and a double derives located before the stabilizers that it keeps certain likeness to the F/A-18C Hornet. Engines were two turbofan of 5600 kg of thrust (possibly General Electric F404) Maximum speed was to ne around Mach 2. Empty weight was to be 7.800 kg. This relatively low value would be achieved by means of the use of compound materials. The experience of Dornier in these materials was wide (Alpha Jet and Do 228). In the proposal for this airplane suggested the use in the wing of 65% Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP), 20% aluminium and the rest in several materials as the titanium, the front fuselage would have 60% of CFRP, the central 18% and the bottom 10%, being completed with other materials employees in the wing, and the stabilizers would have 55% of CFRP, while the fin would take 70%, the same materials would be used for the intake ramps and the landing gear. (aeroespacio 1982/83)  Terms of the project  SAIA 90 over Buenos Aires The F√°brica Militar de Aviones estimated development would take 12 to 15 years after specifications were approved. The first flight of the prototype was planned for 1989, with deliveries two years later.  Looking for partners  By the middle of 1980 F√°brica Militar de Aviones faced serious financial difficulties, with a deficit of U$S 50 million annually. It searched for partners to face diverse business to allow it to survive, giving 49% of their property. It was evident that the factory could not complete the project by itself; it maintained diverse contacts, such as Aermacchi-Aeritalia, McDonnell Douglas and Fairchild, with the intention of attracting a partner with whom to share the project. Although the intention of the air force was to add McDonnell Douglas, which maintained negotiations for a possible license of production of the A-4M Skyhawk II (now, the A-4AR Fightinghawk) and another one of ejection seats for the trainer IA 63 Pampa, but the American company resisted assuming the risk, because its offer of fighters was covered. Another possibility was explored then with Aeritalia-Aermacchi, but the financial problems that it crossed the country they made finally abandon the project.

Its fourth and current clubhouse is located at 38 East 37th Street on the corner of Park Avenue, in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan. It was designed by Benjamin Wistar Morris and opened on February 2, 1931.About the Club, Union League Club website, accessed November 21, 2008 The building was designated a New York City landmark on October 25, 2011.Postal, Matthew A. \\"Union League Club Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (October 25, 2011) The club is considered one of the most prestigious in New York City. Union League clubs, which are legally separate but share similar histories and maintain reciprocal links with one another, are also located in Chicago and Philadelphia. Additional Union League clubs were formerly located in Brooklyn, New York and New Haven. History The club dates its founding from February 6, 1863, during the Civil War. Tensions were running high in New York City at the time, because much of the city's governing class, as well as its large Irish immigrant population, bitterly opposed the war and were eager to reach some kind of accommodation with the Confederate States of America. Thus, pro-Union men chose to form their own club, with the twin goals of cultivating \\"a profound national devotion\\" and to \\"strengthen a love and respect for the Union.\\" The Union League (also known as Loyal Leagues) was actually a political movement before it became a social organization. Its members raised money both to support the United States Sanitary Commission, the forerunner of the American Red Cross, which cared for the Union wounded following battles, and the Union cause generally. The New York League was founded by four prominent professionals and intellectuals: Henry Whitney Bellows, Frederick Law Olmsted, George Templeton Strong, and Oliver Wolcott Gibbs. The men, all members of the United States Sanitary Commission, desired to strengthen the nation state and the national identity. They first aimed to recruit a coalition of moneyed professionals like themselves. Strong believed that the club would only thrive with a respectable catalogue of moneyed men. Olmsted especially desired to recruit the new generation of young, wealthy men, so that the club might teach them the obligations and duties of the upper class. The founders aimed to win the political governing elite over to support of the Union and abolition. They also believed that a centralized government was essential to their prosperity. The national government enforced contracts, tariffs, and an expanding infrastructure, all in the best interest of the professionals in the merchant, financial, and manufacturing classes, which in turn, benefited the population at large. These professionals also Developed an economic interest in the federal government, because as the war progressed, Union League ideas had their effect and New York City's elite bore a disproportional amount of the nation's debt. As they bought more and more war bonds, the holders had an increasing economic interest in the success of the Union, in addition to the convictions that led them to buy the bonds in the first place. Edward Lamson Henry's Presentation of Colors, 1864, depicts the outfitting of two African-American regiments at the Union League Club of New York's first clubhouse on 17th Street, facing Union Square The club held its first official meeting on March 20, 1863. At this first meeting, Robert B. Minturn, head of the nation's second largest shipping firm, was elected president. Some of the elected vice presidents included William H. Aspinwall, Moses Taylor, and Alexander T. Stewart.Lawson, Melinda. Patriot Fires: Forging a New American Nationalism in the Civil War North. Lawrence: University of Kansas, 2002. Print. It did not take long for the club's enemies to make their displeasure felt with the new organization. On July 13, 1863, just five months after the club's foundation and only days after receiving word of the twin Union victories at Gettysburg and at Vicksburg, the New York Draft Riots exploded right in the club's backyard. The Union League Club was high on the vandals' list of targets (right after the Colored Orphan Asylum), but some brave members kept them at bay by maintaining an armed vigil in the locked and barricaded clubhouse on East 17th Street, just off Union Square Park. Bellamy salutes in 1917 at a Fifth Avenue, New York ceremony opposite the Union League Club reviewing stand during the recent \\"Wake Up, America\\" celebration where thousands marched in the procession A few months later, the members decided to make an unmistakable gesture that they had not been intimidated. The club decided to recruit, train and equip a Colored infantry regiment for Union service. The 20th U.S. Colored Infantry was formed on Riker's Island in February 1864. The next month, it marched from the Union League Club, down Canal Street and over to the Hudson River piers to embark for duty in Louisiana. In spite of numerous threats, the members of the Union League Club marched with the men of the 20th, and saw them off. During World War I, the club sponsored the 369th Infantry, the famed Harlem Hellfighters, which was commanded by William Hayward, a club member. During Reconstruction, Union Leagues were formed all across the South. They mobilized freedmen to register to vote. They discussed political issues, promoted civic projects, and mobilized workers opposed to segregationist white employers. Most branches were segregated but there were a few that were racially integrated. The leaders of the all-black units were mostly urban Blacks from the North, who had never been slaves. Foner (p 283) says \\"virtually every Black voter in the South had enrolled.\\" Black League members were special targets of the Ku Klux Klan's violence and intimidation, so the Leagues organized informal armed defense units. After the end of Reconstruction, the Union League Club of New York devoted itself to civic projects and clean government. It and its members helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art,John K.

Morgan II. Unlike many club buildings, the current clubhouse is purpose-built, rather than being a converted mansion or building constructed for another purpose. Membership The club has always promoted clean government and public-spiritedness. Many of its early members, notably cartoonist Thomas Nast, were instrumental in breaking \\"Boss\\" Tweed's political organization. (A future club president, Elihu Root, served as one of Tweed's defense counsels.) Manhattan District Attorney and club member Charles S. Whitman used the privacy afforded by the club to secretly interview witnesses during his investigation of the case that sent NYPD Lt. Charles Becker to the electric chair in 1915. Whitman was elected New York Governor as a result. In all, 15 U.S. Presidents have been members of the club. Two presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Chester A. Arthur, were members of the club prior to entering the White House and former presidents resident in New York, notably Ulysses S. Grant and Herbert Hoover, were active members. Theodore Roosevelt was blackballed when he first applied for membership in 1881, possibly because his mother, Martha Bulloch Roosevelt, was a well-known Confederate sympathizer. Following the sudden deaths of his wife and mother in 1884, however, he was offered membership and accepted. After running on the Bull Moose Party ticket in 1912, Roosevelt was persona non grata at the club for several years, being welcomed back after the United States entered World War I. Long a men's club, it decided to admit women in the 1980s. Faith Whittlesey, President Reagan's Ambassador to Switzerland was the first female member (1986). Women now play prominent roles in the club's leadership including the Board of Governors, the Admissions Committee, the Public Affairs Committee, and the House Committee. In 2020, the club elected its first woman president, Mary Beth Sullivan. Brent Scowcroft, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Henry Kissinger are Honorary Members, as well as Neil Armstrong, Margaret Thatcher, Antonin Scalia, Barbara Bush, and H. Norman Schwarzkopf. The club has a strong artistic tradition (see list of members below). Some artist-members in the 19th century contributed paintings to the club in lieu of dues, and these remain part of the club's collection. =Awards= The club bestows four awards: The Lincoln Literary Award to outstanding American authors; The Theodore Roosevelt American Experience Award to individuals who have \\"enriched the American experience;\\" The American History Award to an individual who has had a significant and/or enduring impact on, or relating to American History; and The Eastman Johnson Award, to individuals whose unique contributions to art and culture have elevated the ideals of American Citizenship. =Notable members= Some league members from 1903 *George Bethune Adams, federal judge; *Chester A.

As of 2000, the Church had 12,475 members in 133 local churches. The Church sponsors missionaries in seven countries. Its official emblem is composed of a red flame, symbolizing the fire of the Holy Spirit which descended at Pentecost, atop an open Bible. It has published an official magazine, The Evangelical Challenge, and a newsletter, The Heartbeat.  History  The Evangelical Church of North America was officially born June 4, 1968, in Portland, Oregon. But the origin of The Evangelical Church can be traced back to two earlier movements: the Wesleyan awakening in England under John Wesley, the founder of The Methodist Church, and the United Brethren in Christ movement in Pennsylvania, spearheaded by preachers such as William Otterbein and Martin Boehm. The early Methodists in England and later North America declared that men can be saved from sin, through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, and that this experience must be followed by a life of dedication and holiness, or \\"sanctification.\\" Meanwhile, the work of the United Brethren in Christ grew rapidly after its first Conference was held in York County, Pennsylvania, in 1789. These brethren believed that God is a God of order, and that where there is no order and no church discipline, the spirit of love and charity will be lost. This stream of Protestantism found much in common with the early American Methodists‚Äîa relationship that would eventually lead up to the formation of the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB) in 1946. At its annual session in 1967, the Pacific Northwest Conference of the EUB Church voted by a two-thirds majority to secede from its parent body and continue to operate as a separate denomination. The action was taken in anticipation of the EUB's upcoming merger with the Methodist Church (USA). Dissenters differed with an increasingly Modernist trend in American Methodism over Biblical authority, \\"the social gospel,\\" and the doctrine of Entire Sanctification. The EUB Book of Discipline (the controlling document of church governance) made no provision for the secession of local congregations or regional conferences, and the denomination did not recognize the validity of the Pacific Northwest Conference's action (or similar votes taken at congregational meetings). The merger between the EUB and The Methodist Church was effected in April 1968, forming the United Methodist Church. This action took title to all assets and properties formerly belonging to the Pacific Northwest Conference, including its local churches and organizations. On June 4, 1968, in Portland, Oregon, forty-six congregations and about eighty ministers met in a session to organize a separate denomination known as the Evangelical Church of North America (ECNA). Before the end of June 1968, laity and ministers from North Dakota and Montana, representing more than twenty additional congregations, had joined. In 1969, the Evangelical Church entered into a financial settlement agreement with the Methodists whereby the new denomination gained title to some of the facilities of the former EUB Church, including most of the secessionist congregations' property. That same year, the Holiness Methodist Church united with the Evangelical Church, bringing along a mission field in Bolivia. In 1975, the Wesleyan Covenant Church, became part of the Evangelical Church, along with its missionary work in Mexico and Brownsville, Texas, and its work among the Navajo Indians in New Mexico. At some point the Evangelical Church in Canada was formed as a conference of the ECNA, but by 1993 it separated and merged into the Evangelical Missionary Church of Canada (EMCC).http://www.theevangelicalchurch.org/#!our-roots/c14wg A mention was made at the 2006 General Conference of the Evangelical Methodist Church (EMC) of talks of a possible merger with the ECNA. By 2014, the denominations were sharing a common ministry training school. Theology The Evangelical Church is strongly Wesleyan-Arminian, emphasizing free will over determinism and salvation through a two separate and instantaneous acts of Grace, justification and sanctification, attained through Faith resulting in repentance. This, together with Biblical inerrancy and belief in a direct command of God to universally evangelize, are common to the various bodies which comprise the Holiness movement. The Church has an official Statement of Faith, which is based on that of the Methodism inherited from the EUB, but which has been revised to make these emphases of doctrine more specific and Evangelical. Governance The polity of the Evangelical Church can be described as congregational-connectional. Like other denominations in the Methodist tradition, the principal governing body of the Evangelical Church is a general conference, with delegates from each of six regional conferences. The regional conferences meet annually with delegates from each of the local congregations within their respective territories. The Church does not have bishops, but is led by Conference Superintendents and a General Superintendent, who are elected to fixed terms, and who all have pastoral and administrative responsibilities. Affiliations The Evangelical Church is a member of the Christian Holiness Association and the National Association of Evangelicals. The Evangelical Church is a missionary oriented church averaging at least one adult missionary per local church. The three major organizations supported, beyond the Evangelical Church Missions department, are OMS International, World Gospel Mission and Wycliffe Bible Translators. In addition, Evangelical Church members serve through a score of other interdenominational missions organizations.

Gardner was the first to build a home in the area that would take its name from him. This name was kept despite his history during the Revolutionary War. He had at first supported his fellow colonists' demands for redress from Britain, but felt actually declaring independence was a reckless move that would backfire on the colonists and stayed out of the war.

They ended up becoming permanent settlements, forming distinct cultures as enclaves of mainlanders in Taiwanese cities. Over the years, many military dependents' villages have suffered from urban problems such as housing dereliction, abandonment, urban decay, and urban slum. The houses in these villages were often haphazardly and poorly constructed, having been built hastily and with limited funding. The residents had no private land ownership rights for the houses they lived in, as the land was government property. Hsinchu city, with a new memorial stone. Following the passage of the Act for Rebuilding Old Quarters for Military Dependents in 1996, the government began an aggressive program of demolishing these villages and replacing them with highrises, giving the residents rights to live in the new apartments. As of 2019, there are less than 30 left out of an original number of 879, and some have been preserved as historic sites. In a broad sense, the word can also mean the quarters for U.S. Military Advisory Group officers and their dependents in Taiwan. Architecture Military Dependents' Village house In the 1950s, most Dependents' Villages, except the legacy from the Japanese colonization, were built with minimal building standards on public land. The very common properties were built with straw-laid roof and mud-consolidated bamboo wall. It was only after the 1960s that the military reconstructed properties with bricks; and at the same time incorporated private toilets, bathrooms, kitchens, main pillars, roof tiles and electrical circuits into the properties. Till this, the properties of the Dependents Village had finally reached the same standards aligning with the rest of the architectures in Taiwan. By the end of the 1970s, Taiwan's property market was heated up with tremendous amount of newly built and renovated properties. However, due to housing ownership problems, houses in the Dependents Villages could not been rebuilt and replaced. Most of them suffered from outdated facilities and crowdedness. Each house had only 6‚Äì10 ping (1 ping ‚âà 3.3 square metres) excluded the attached garden. Hence brick construction or reinforced brick- built, low level ju√†nc≈´n properties had been comparatively derelict, especially within inner urban area. Generally speaking, ju√†nc≈´n from ten to hundreds of units tend to segregate themselves from the rest of the society. Although it tightened the relationship within the village, it had unavoidably prevented mingling and communications between the tenants and the rest of the communities outside. Dependents' Villages is a unique cultural landscape that may soon pass into oblivion, as old soldiers pass away and urban renewal and redevelopment takes place. Also, out of patriotism and anti-Communism, residents of the military dependents' village, sharing the same professionalism, could usually build their own sense of community through frequent social networking. In the early period, considering the sensitivity of soldiers' identity, the surrounding areas of military camps were heavily guarded, including the dependents' village; for the sake of clarification, relatives of soldiers had to present their resident permit in order to have access. Because the salary of soldiers was low at that time, the government provided educational assistance, medical treatment, and daily necessities like rice, flour, salad, and so forth, to supplement their living, which could be received only by showing a certain certificate as evidence. Mahjong is the most popular leisure activity. As the residents of the dependents' village all came from different provinces, along with them, they brought different tastes and regional wheaten foods, which contributed to the elaboration of Taiwanese wheaten food culture. Part of the slang used in military dependents' village later got integrated into the vocabularies of Taiwanese language. Initially, none of the military families would have expected a permanent stalemate across the Taiwan straits. They either hoped to regroup, rearm, and then retake the mainland with US assistance, or feared that Communist armies would press on and take Taiwan too. In either case, the immediate impulse was to consider Taiwan as a temporary refuge for the medium-term. Urban debates Ju√†nc≈´n is a burdened landscape inherited from the martial law era (1949‚Äì1987) in Taiwan. It has been seen as an unfair welfare provision that was predominately available to the Kuomintang (KMT) military and their families. The impact to the society in terms of social segregation and imbalance resource allocation has turn out to be more revolted than expected. Ju√†nc≈´n has now been the focus of dynamic architectural, political and cultural debate shaped by tensions between different collective memories as well as conflicting interests and visions of what the new urban landscape of 'new' Taiwan should be. G. Delanty and P. R. Jones's discourse (2002) about continuous debates and struggles as to which memories and symbols are to be preserved or destroyed from the urban landscape of the city can be clearly realized in the context of ju√†nc≈´n and its preservation.

MAC addresses are uniquely assigned to each card, so using MAC filtering on a network permits and denies network access to specific devices through the use of blacklists and whitelists. While the restriction of network access through the use of lists is straightforward, an individual person is not identified by a MAC address, rather a device only, so an authorized person will need to have a whitelist entry for each device that he or she would use to access the network. While giving a network some additional protection, MAC filtering can be circumvented by using a packet analyzer to find a valid MAC and then using MAC spoofing to access the network using that address. MAC address filtering can be considered as security through obscurity because the effectiveness is based on \\"the secrecy of the implementation or its components\\".  Port security  Many devices that support MAC filtering do so on a device basis. Whitelisted MAC addresses are allowed through any port on the device and blacklisted MAC addresses are blocked on all ports. Other devices, such as Cisco Catalyst switches, support MAC filtering on a port-by-port basis. This is referred to as port security. Port security may be configured statically with a list, dynamically based on the first given number of addresses detected, or a combination of these two methods. When port security is configured, the default settings are to allow only one MAC address per port, and to shut down the port if the allowed number of addresses is exceeded. Wireless client isolation MAC filtering is also used on enterprise wireless networks with multiple access points to create a private VLAN and prevent clients from communicating with each other.

The Most Holy Governing Synod () was the highest governing body of the Russian Orthodox Church between 1721 and 1918 (1918 is when the Church re-instated the Patriarchate). The jurisdiction of the Most Holy Synod extended over every kind of ecclesiastical question and over some partly secular matters. Peter I of Russia established the Synod on January 25, 1721 in the course of his church reform. Its establishment was followed by the abolition of the Patriarchate. The Synod was composed partly of ecclesiastical persons, partly of laymen appointed by the Tsar. Members included the Metropolitans of Saint Petersburg, Moscow and Kyiv, and the Exarch of Georgia. Originally, the Synod had ten ecclesiastical members, but the number later changed to twelve. Background A series of reforms by Peter the Great inspired the creation of the Most Holy Synod. The new Imperial Age saw radical change and developments in economic, social and cultural aspects of Russian life. Peter traveled twice to Europe and made reforms that reflected his desire to westernize Russia and worked to Russify the European models to better fit his nation. Beyond forming the Synod in an effort to enfeeble the power and authority of the Russian Orthodox Church, he also challenged traditional Russian values, which were rooted in religion and a social structure defined by boyars and aristocracy, merchants, clerics, peasants and serfs. He did so by implementing enlightenment ideals‚Äîexcept for any that would have resulted in democratizing the Russian government, tolerating political or religious dissent, or encouraging the free growth of thought or ideas; establishing the Julian calendar; reorganizing the Russian army in the European style; establishing a meritocracy (as opposed to the previous system of delineating positions by aristocratic lineage); outlawing or taxing beards (which were common among the Old Believers); etc. Peter‚Äôs desire for the consolidation and standardization of authority led to the creation of the Synod. With one leader (the patriarch) the church proved too great of a threat to Peter‚Äôs rule, and he was unwilling to share power.Riasanovsky, Nicholas Valentine, and Mark D. Steinberg. ‚ÄúThe Reign of Peter the Great.‚Äù A History of Russia. Vol. I. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. 211-29. Print. pp. 215-219 Road to the Synod When the conservative Patriarch Adrian died in 1700, Peter left the position unfilled and instead Metropolitan Stephen Iavorsky, a supporter of reform, administered the church for roughly twenty years. In 1721 the church officially came under the cloak of the Russian national government with the Spiritual Order, which was ostensibly written primarily by Archbishop Theophanes Prokopovich.Riasanovsky, Nicholas Valentine, and Mark D. Steinberg. ‚ÄúThe Reign of Peter the Great.‚Äù A History of Russia. Vol. I. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. 211-29. Print. page 230 After Patriarch Adrian died, Peter, through the inspiration and encouragement of his official A.A. Kurbatov, decided to abolish the patriarchal Razryadnyi Prikaz (rank prikaz), which was in charge of civil and military administration, and redirected all matters to the appropriate prikaz, an administrative or judicial office. This event and others demonstrated that little by little, Peter‚Äôs administration rendered each church division powerless and their duties transferred to paralleled governmental departments. Some scholars argue, though, that Peter did not intend to abolish the Patriarchate when he began altering the administrative structure of the church. Delaying choosing a new patriarch proved economically advantageous; by restricting ecclesiastic land ownership and other financial luxuries of the clergy, the state saved money. This gave Peter further incentive to abolish the Patriarchy.Cracraft, James. The Church Reform of Peter the Great. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1971. Print pages 114-115. In 1711, reform allotted the Senate jurisdiction over all peoples, including ecclesiastical subjects. This meant that the state now had authority over issues that had been previously reserved for church authorities. With this power came the ability, in certain situations, for the state to determine clerics for administration in religious positions.Cracraft, James. The Church Reform of Peter the Great. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1971. Print. page 137 In 1716 Peter formulated an oath for the bishops-elect of Vologda and Astrakhan and Yavorskii. The oath, divided into seven parts, served as a supplement to the present oath. The first two parts regard the appropriate method for dealing with heretics and oppositionists. The third section designates that monks of their dioceses were not to travel outside diocese limits, unless for an urgent matter, and only then with written permission. The oath prohibited the building of any unnecessary churches (point 4) and the hiring on of any unessential clerics (point 5). The oath required clergy to visit their diocese at least once a year in order to dispel superstition or apostates and to congregate believers (point 6). Finally, the oath compelled bishops to swear that they would not become involved in secular affairs or legal proceedings.Cracraft, James. The Church Reform of Peter the Great. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1971. Print. page 141 Peter‚Äôs attitude towards the Church Peter was determined to westernize Russia during his reign, and the church was an integral part of his campaign. As mentioned earlier, the new structure of the church in many ways resembled that of European countries, such as Sweden and Germany.Riasanovsky, Nicholas Valentine, and Mark D. Steinberg. ‚ÄúThe Reign of Peter the Great.‚Äù A History of Russia. Vol. I. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. 211-31. Print. pages 230-231 In a broader sense, though, Peter was attempting to modernize Russia through secularization, which was a vital step in the course of European political modernization during this time. Secularization, in this instance, meant the institutionalization and increased breadth of the state‚Äôs wealth and authority coupled with the dwindling power of the church.Cracraft, James. \\"Diplomatic and Bureaucratic Revolutions, Revolutions and Resistance.\\" The Revolution of Peter the Great. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2003. 60-65, 120-130. Print. page 62 The church also became politically subject to the government, instead of the traditional relationship between church and state, in which rulers, such as Ivan IV, felt in some ways subject to the approval of the Orthodox Church in order to remain a legitimate sovereign. Peter used the Synod to find and punish dissident Russians. An addition in 1722 to the Ecclesiastic Regulation, which replaced the patriarch as the church head, required clerics to report any seditious confessions.Cracraft, James. \\"Diplomatic and Bureaucratic Revolutions, Revolutions and Resistance.\\" The Revolution of Peter the Great. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2003. 60-65, 120-130. Print. page 120 Before the creation of the Most Holy Synod, Peter concerned himself with improvements in the church. He was particularly interested in improving the education of the clerics, since many were illiterate and unable to administer sacraments.Cracraft, James. The Church Reform of Peter the Great. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1971. Print. At the time Peter established the Synod, he also issued the Spiritual Order, mentioned above. One key aspect of this edict was that it disregarded or denied the divinity of the church and saw it primarily as a state institution.Krindatch, Alexey. \\"Changing relationships between Religion, the State, and Society in Russia.\\" GeoJournal 67.4 (2006): 267-282. Print. page 269 Formation The Holy Synod replaced the job of the patriarch with ten, and later twelve, clerics. The chief procurator (Ober-Prokuror), the first of which was Colonel I. V. Boltin, oversaw the Synod in order to verify the legality of their actions and the prompt and orderly fulfillment of their responsibilities.Cracraft, James. The Church Reform of Peter the Great. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1971. Print. page 175 Peter required priests to report traitorous confessions, but he did not push his ability to control to the limit, for example abstaining from secularizing church lands. Under the Synod, the church became more tolerant of various denominations, even extending this policy to the Old Believers for a period of time. Intermarriage between Orthodox and Western Christians was permitted starting in the year of the Synod‚Äôs formation.Riasanovsky, Nicholas Valentine, and Mark D. Steinberg. ‚ÄúThe Reign of Peter the Great.‚Äù A History of Russia. Vol. I. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. 211-29. Print. pages 230-231 The Synod was intended, presumably, to mirror the church-state relationship in the Lutheran countries of northern Europe. Although the emperor did not wield authority in matters of faith, the government effectively controlled organization, finances and policies of the church. With the mindset that the government should play an active role in the lives of citizens, Peter expected the church to do the same. He directed the church to form public welfare projects for the benefit of the common people. These included almshouses and Christian schools.Riasanovsky, Nicholas Valentine, and Mark D. Steinberg. ‚ÄúThe Reign of Peter the Great.‚Äù A History of Russia. Vol. I. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011. 211-29. Print. pages 230-231 In November 1718, Peter formed an Ecclesiastical College in St. Petersburg, as it was the center of civil government. Soon, the ‚ÄúEcclesiastical College‚Äù would have a name change to ‚ÄúMost Holy All-Ruling Synod‚Äù.Cracraft, James. The Church Reform of Peter the Great. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1971. Print. page 153 Duties The Synod functioned under the Ecclesiastical Regulation statute with the goal of administrating and reforming the church. The statute stated that the eleven members of the college were to be of varying classes and ranks. One president, two vice-presidents, four councilors and four assessors comprised the council and each member would get one vote when determining a dispute.Cracraft, James. The Church Reform of Peter the Great. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1971. Print. page 165 Formed as a reaction to Peter‚Äôs views of Russia as compared to Western Europe, the Synod was a concentration of clerics who had received extensive formal higher education. It worked to gain as much of the disputed church property as possible, and after assuming control of the patriarchal domain the Synod was accountable for the lives of 6000 people. It was to be revered absolutely in all things and possessed ‚Äúpatriarchal power, honour, and authority‚Äù.Cracraft, James. The Church Reform of Peter the Great. Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 1971. Print. pages 183 and 230 The primary duties of the Synod were to supervise the direction of the Orthodox faith, instruct people on religious matters, celebrate feasts and determine questions of order and ritual.

There were two different editions printed in the United States in 1920. The earlier, entitled The Protocols and World Revolution, associated with Boris Brasol and published by Small, Maynard and Company. The later, entitled Praemonitus Praemunitus associated with Harris A. Houghton and published by the Beckwith Company. Biography She was the granddaughter of two servicemen of the tsar of Russia. One of her grandfathers resigned being a colonel-lieutenant, another one was a major. Her father Vladimir Karpovich Debogory-Mokriyevich (May 24, 1848 - Nov. 2, 1926) had been imprisoned under the tsarist government for revolutionary activities. He was a well-known Russian Revolutionary-Narodnik (Populist), who escaped from prison in Siberia and later married her mother Julie Gortynsky (1860 -1933?) in Switzerland. Her mother Julie Gortynsky was from a noble family and educated at the Kiev Institute for noble girls in Kiev (Gortynsky family clan produced many well educated women: Julie's cousin Maria Gortynsky-Pavlova (1854 - 1938) was the first Russian woman - professor of Paleontology and academician of Academy of Sciences of USSR, her other cousin Olga Gortynsky (1855 - 1903) was among the first Russian women licensed to practice as a Doctor of Medicine). Upon graduation Julie studied in Paris and Geneva. Natalie was born in Geneva on April 15, 1887 and was in Russia a few times until 1895 when her mother Julie was exiled from Russia with no permission to return due to her unreliability and close ties with emigre Vladimir Debogory-Mokrievich. After Nicholas II's amnesty of 1905 Julie returned to Russia and Natalie had never seen her mother again. Natalie married Albert Sonnichsen, a writer,Who's Who; 1919 had one child Eric in 1909, and was divorced from him in 1919. Eventually she moved to Paris, after losing custody of her son in a very public legal fight, and she worked as Sol Hurok's publicity person in Europe and eventually a writer for the International Herald Tribune. She died in 1939 in Paris, and her ashes are interred in vault no. 4780 in the columbarium at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. She worked as the assistant of the physician and military intelligence officer in the service of the U.S. War Department, Harris Ayers Houghton, who paid for her services out of his own private funds. Houghton engaged her as his personal and investigative assistant for nine months, and subsequently claimed that no public funds were used for her services. She had obtained a Russian version of the Protocols of Zion from the notorious White Russian and extremely antisemitic tsarist officer Boris Brasol, and thereafter she requested, under her own initiative and received authorization to translate it into the English language. She did not work alone, but with close consultation with Brasol, and another former tsarist officer, General G. J. Sosnowsky. See also *Harris A.

For information on the 1945 landings by Australian forces in the same area, see Second Battle of Balikpapan. The First Battle of Balikpapan took place on 23‚Äì24 January 1942, off the major oil producing town and port of Balikpapan, on Borneo, in the Netherlands East Indies. After capturing the destroyed oilfield at Tarakan from the Allies in the Battle of Tarakan, the Japanese force‚Äîthe Sakaguchi Detachment (named for its commander, Major General Shizuo Sakaguchi)-moved on to Balikpapan with the hope that the oilfields there had not been destroyed. In the ensuing conflict, the Japanese successfully landed and seized the oil facilities. A short time later an American destroyer task force ambushed the Japanese invasion convoy and sank multiple transports. Background The Dutch army in Balikpapan numbered approximately 1,100 troops, under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel Cornelis van den Hoogenband. The city itself was protected by coast, anti-aircraft, and field batteries. The entrance of the harbor was protected by a minefield laid by the minelayer Soemenep under the command of Lt. T. Jellema. On 18 January, the Dutch commander ordered the destruction of oil installations in Balikpapan and started to evacuate his staff to Samarinda. However, the destruction was not complete; the only serious damage was to tanks, pipes and special quays in the harbor area. Battle =Land engagement= On 22 January, the Japanese fleet was sighted moving south by an American PBY flying boat, and on 23 January formations of Dutch bombers attacked the convoy. Despite this, the Japanese unit successfully landed approximately southeast of Balikpapan airfield on the evening of 24 January. The assault unit landed without meeting enemy resistance and, by dawn, had occupied the airfield. The southward advance moved slowly as the bridges had been destroyed, and the unit reached the northern outskirts of Balikpapan City on the night of 25 January. The Dutch garrison troops had been withdrawn and the Japanese entered the city without a fight. A portion of the Sakaguchi Detachment called the Surprise Attack Unit proceeded up the river in camouflaged landing craft, evaded detection, and landed just south of the reservoir at 04:30 on the 25th. It proceeded to the village of Banoeabaroe, arriving there at 14:40, thus cutting off the Dutch line of retreat. While the unit was advancing along the road to Balikpapan City, it ran into a Dutch military column, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel C. van den Hoogenband, attempting to escape from Balikpapan. After defeating this Dutch column, the Surprise Attack Unit proceeded to Balikpapan City. After Balikpapan was occupied, a new detachment was formed led by Lt. Col. Kume. He was ordered to secure and protect the oil fields. The main force moved forward along the Balikpapan City-Samboaja-Sangasanga-Samarinda-Road, mopping up the remaining Dutch troops in the vicinity of Samarinda. =Naval Engagement= Replica Brewster B339C. The Dutch used the fighter also as a light dive bomber against Japanese convoys. In the afternoon of 23 January, nine Dutch Martin B-10 bombers, escorted by 20 Brewster Buffaloes from 2-VLG-V and 3-VLG-V, attacked the Japanese convoy. The transport ship Tatsugami Maru was damaged and sunk. Near Balikpapan, the Dutch submarine , under Lieutenant Commander van Well Groeneveld, attacked and sank the transport Tsuruga Maru and reportedly damaged the patrol boat P-37 by midnight, but was later heavily damaged itself by depth charges and forced to withdraw to Surabaya. While the Japanese invasion force was landing at Balikpapan, on the early morning of 24 January, at around 02:45, the 59th U.S. Navy Destroyer Division under Rear Admiral William A. Glassford and Commander Paul H. Talbot, acting on orders from Admiral Hart, attacked the Japanese navy escort led by Rear Admiral Shoji Nishimura for about four hours.Costello (1981), p. 191. The U.S. Destroyer Division composed of , , and attacked the twelve transport ships and the three patrol boats (World War I-era destroyers) escorting them. The Japanese destroyer escorts were undertaking a search for the Dutch submarine which had been sighted earlier. At least four transport ships‚ÄîKuretake Maru, Nana Maru, Sumanoura Maru and Tatsukami Maru‚Äîand patrol boat P-37 were sunk in torpedo attacks. Two other transports were damaged by gunfire or torpedoes. Gunfire from one of the armed transports damaged the John D. Ford. The Ford returned fire, inflicting 50 casualties on the transport. At 04:00 the Ford withdrew. Aftermath = Analyses = The battle was the first surface engagement in Southeast Asia that the U.S. Navy had participated in since the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898. The American destroyers expended all of their torpedoes with only a few hits, mostly because of the as yet unrealized problems with the Mark 15 torpedo running too deep. Because the landing had taken place around 21:30, the raid was too late to stop the capture of Balikpapan. While the various attacks on the Japanese transports did little to prevent the fall of Balikpapan, it proved that Admiral Hart's conservative strategy could be effectively used against Japanese forces until Allied forces in the Southeast Asia area could be bolstered.Jeffrey C. Nelson. (1994). ABDACOM: AMERICA‚ÄôS FIRST COALITION EXPERIENCE IN WORLD WAR II It was under his orders that the destroyers conducted the raid and sank the four transports. Crucial to the success of the destroyer raid was also the fact that it had been conducted by an all American force, operating under the same doctrine and protocol, whereas other ABDACOM engagements of combined forces (the Battle of the Java Sea, notably) suffered from much confusion. Hart was later relieved of command and replaced with the much bolder Conrad Helfrich. Balikpapan remained under Japanese control until July 1945, when the Japanese force was defeated by an Australian-led force in the 1945 Battle of Balikpapan.

Professor Joseph Camilleri was the director of the centre from 2006 until 2013. The current director is Professor Alberto Gomez. The research centre specialises in the philosophy, method and practice of dialogue between communities, cultures, religions and civilisations. The key aims of the Centre include: * Educational projects designed to promote inter- cultural/inter-civilisational dialogue in schools and universities * Research that addresses the challenges and opportunities presented by cultural, religious and political diversity and conflict * Policy advice to governmental bodies, international agencies and non-governmental organisations * Events, such as public forums, conferences, workshops, professional development days, courses, seminars consultations and media events * Publications, such as working papers, books, articles, reports and media comment. Projects of the centre thumb The focus of the centre is largely concentrated on inter- cultural, inter-religious conflict and inter-civilisational conflict, as well as the researching of practical methods of dialogue which may encourage peaceful resolutions to conflict and mechanisms for cooperation. The Centre for Dialogue has several current ongoing projects which act as the hallmark of the institutions' study. Examples of such ongoing projects are investigating the tensions relations to the role of religion and culture in international politics, particularly since the 11 September terrorist attacks. Such projects continue to focus on how the government, nongovernment and civil society sectors have responded, most notable in Europe, the United States, and Asia (including Australia). The projects investigate both domestic conflict (for example, strategies to curb escalating tensions between Muslims and non- Muslims) and international tensions (for example, the implications arising from the rise of Political Islam and the War on Terror in international politics). Other projects include: * The Education Dialogue Project, which has investigated ways that dialogue can enhance intercultural awareness and understanding in Victorian schools. * The Dialogue Diaspora Project which explores the nature of tensions between ethno-nationalist diasporic communities in Australia whose homelands are in conflict (for example, the Sri Lankan, Iraqi and Cypriot communities). The project examines the formation and transformation of such conflicts in Australia and explores practical dialogical methods to reduce their impact. * The Northern Interfaith Network which is developing a network of initiatives in Melbourne's culturally-diverse northern suburbs with five municipalities and seven organisations. It aims to provide government agencies (federal and state), religious and ethnic groups and community organisations with tested guidelines to facilitate community based dialogue initiatives. The Centre for Dialogue also runs several educational programmes, such as the Muslim Leadership Program for Young Muslims which aims to empower young Muslim men and women and help them to reach their full potential as citizens and future leaders. Publications left The Centre for Dialogue composes and distributes publications arising from their diverse research projects. This includes the publication of books, edited volumes and journal articles, as well as discussion papers that are distributed to relevant organisations and government departments. The centre also distributes a bi-annual newsletter that reports on the centre's activities, as well as includes opinion pieces on issues that relate to the centre's interests. The Centre for Dialogue also distributes several working papers each year that do not necessarily relate to the centre's projects. Monographs are submitted to the centre to be considered by the editorial committee for publication. The intention of the Working Papers is to provide the research community (including students and academics), policy-makers, journalists and community leaders with an opportunity to contribute to ongoing debates. Papers are preferred to focus on the dynamics of conflict (whether intrastate, inter-state, or trans-state). They generally must also identify ways in which the theory and/or practice of dialogue has contributed to coexistence, co-operation and mutual enrichment and highlight methods that may foster peaceful relations in the future. The Centre for Dialogue and its staff provide the core of the editorial input of the scholarly journal, Global Change, Peace and Security, published by Routledge and edited from La Trobe University. The previous director; Professor Joseph Camilleri's most recent book, co-authored with Professor Jim Falk, was launched by UNDP head, the Hon Helen Clark, in Sydney, Australia in February 2010. The book \\"Worlds in Transition: Evolving Governance Across a Stressed Planet\\", Edward Elgar, UK, is a synoptic overview of the way in which humans have come to collectively seek to shape their futures, and the challenges posed to that in a time of rapid transition. The Centre for Dialogue hosts one major national or international conference and one major public lecture each year, such as an international conference titled 'Europe and Asia: Between Islam and the United States' in 2008, and a 2009 controversial keynote address by former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.

Early life He was born in Moundsville, West Virginia. At age 19 he apprenticed in the Mackintosh Hemphill Steel Foundry in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in 1909, at the age of 40, he became president of Mackintosh Hemphill, but resigned shortly thereafter due to ill health, suffering from lungs irritated by a galvanizing compound used in steel mills. He moved to Hot Springs, Arkansas, thinking that he was going to die. Oil business ventures In 1910 he was approached by John G. McCaskey, a social acquaintance from Pittsburgh, and E. W. Marland, president and founder of the 101 Ranch Oil Company of Ponca City, Oklahoma, that was on the verge of failure, having run out of money after drilling seven wells and only having found natural gas.(1) McFadden was impressed with Marland and, after visiting the Miller Brothers 101 Ranch property, decided to invest in the company. McCaskey then raised additional funds from Pittsburgh investors, reorganized the company and was elected president; McFadden was elected vice president, general manager. Shortly thereafter a drilling lease was obtained on the Willie Cry Ponca Indian allotment, and on June 11, 1911, the well ‚ÄúWilly- Cries-For-War‚Äù struck oil, bringing wealth to the company and its investors. (2, 3) Later, after McCaskey sold his interests in the 101 Ranch Oil Company and the Kay County Gas Company to Marland Refining Company (later the Marland Oil Company), McFadden was appointed president of the Kay County Gas Company, and also vice president of Marland Refining Company and an executive at Marland Oil Company. Political activity In 1914 McFadden was elected mayor of Ponca City, serving until 1920. Philanthropic activities and honors McFadden funded and sponsored a private camp, Camp McFadden, for Camp Fire Girls, with over 5,000 girls attending the camp through 1950. He also financed the American Legion Orphans Home School in Ponca City. In 1935 McFadden was placed in Oklahoma‚Äôs Hall of Fame. E. W. Marland had a statue of McFadden cast in his likeness called \\"The Plainsman\\" which is now on exhibition at Woolaroc Museum in Northeastern Oklahoma on Oklahoma State Highway 123 about southwest of Bartlesville, Oklahoma and north of Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1946 McFadden was awarded the Gulich Award given by the Camp Fire Girls. McFadden married to Helen Charolette Williams Levi in 1920. They had no children. In 1928 McFadden moved to Fort Worth, Texas, where he died on November 1, 1956, at the age of 87. Sources * 1 American Biography a New Cyclopedia, Volume LXV.

For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2005, the airport had 170,000 aircraft operations, an average of 465 per day: 97% general aviation, 2% air taxi and 1% military. At that time there were 281 aircraft based at this airport: 62% single-engine, 21% multi- engine, 12% jet and 5% helicopter. Historic Hangar #2 houses the Greater Saint Louis Air & Space Museum and the airport is still home to the nation's oldest flight school, Parks College of Engineering and Aviation's Center for Aerospace Sciences, which holds CAA Flight School Certificate #1. History One of the Curtiss-Wright hangars The airport opened in 1929 as Curtiss- Steinberg Airport. In 1940 it was renamed Curtiss-Parks Airport, followed by Parks Metropolitan Airport later that same year. Taken over by the United States Army Air Forces on 1 August 1939 as a basic (level 1) pilot training airfield. Assigned to USAAF Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command). Parks Air College conducted contract basic flying training. Flying training was performed with Fairchild PT-19s as the primary trainer. Also had several PT-17 Stearmans and a few P-40 Warhawks assigned. Inactivated 12 March 1944 with the drawdown of AAFTC's pilot training program. The airport closed in 1959 and reopened six years later as Bi-State Parks Airport. It was renamed St. Louis Downtown-Parks Airport in 1984 and received its current name in 1999. The two survivors out of the airport's original four hangars, Hangar 1 and Hangar 2, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Past airline service In 1971, Air Mid-America Airlines was operating scheduled passenger flights from the airport nonstop to Chicago Midway Airport (MDW) and Springfield, IL (SPI) with 40-passenger seat Convair 600 turboprop airliners.http://www.timetableimages.com, Dec. 15, 1971 Air Mid-America Airlines timetable In 1984, Air Midwest was operating scheduled passenger flights from the airport nonstop to Chicago Midway Airport (MDW) and Kansas City Downtown Airport (MKC) with Swearingen Metro II commuter propjets.http://www.departedflights.com, Sept. 1, 1984 Air Midwest route map See also * Illinois World War II Army Airfields * 31st Flying Training Wing (World War II) References * Shaw, Frederick J.

He was the first Resident Commissioner of the colony of South Australia, the first Mayor of Adelaide and the first resident South Australian to be knighted. Early life and career James Hurtle Fisher was born on 1 May 1790 in Sunbury, then part of Middlesex, England, the eldest son of James and Henrietta Harriet Fisher. He was articled to London solicitors Brown and Gotobed and admitted to practice in July 1811. He married Elizabeth Johnson on 5 October 1813. He commenced practice as a solicitor in 1816. Bound for South Australia Fisher became a member of the South Australian Building Committee in September 1835; in November he was selected as resident commissioner. On 13 July 1836, he was formally appointed Registrar, and, on the next day, Resident Commissioner, under the South Australian Act. This meant he also had a position in the South Australian Legislative Council. His role as Resident Commissioner gave him the power to dispose of public lands in the new colony ‚Äì the proceeds of the sale would be, following Wakefield's plan, used to fund the emigration of workers to the colony. In power he was to be second only to the governor, with the added stipulation that his powers and those of the governor would be entirely separate. In July 1836 Fisher and his family left England, accompanying the governor's party aboard . They arrived at Holdfast Bay on 28 December 1836, where the new settlement was proclaimed. Disputes with Governor Hindmarsh Fisher had been allowed to draft his own instructions ‚Äî these were not shown to Governor Hindmarsh. Disputes between the two men over their powers had begun aboard the Buffalo and were revived during sessions of the new Council of Government. In February 1837 the Resident Magistrate's Court bound the two to keep the peace towards each other. Disagreement also arose over the site of the city, which Hindmarsh wanted moved closer to the port, and over the slow progress of the survey. Hindmarsh failed in his bid to move the city and the survey did progress. In March Fisher called a meeting of holders of land orders to select their town acres, and the remaining acres were auctioned soon after. Further controversy arose with encroachment of the governor's garden on public land. In August, Hindmarsh suspended Robert Gouger from his office of Colonial Secretary. John Brown, a servant of Fisher and not subject to the governor, was nevertheless also suspended on 11 September 1837. Fisher immediately issued a handbill stating that Brown still held office; Hindmarsh later issued a contradictory proclamation. Tit-for-tat accusations continued, with both parties communicating to London. In March 1838 Governor Hindmarsh was recalled to London, leaving Adelaide in July. This was no victory for Fisher, however: the new governor, George Gawler, was given the combined powers of Governor and Resident Commissioner, effective on his arrival in October 1838. Fisher returned to law and became a leader of the South Australian Bar. Political life In October 1840, Fisher was elected inaugural Mayor of Adelaide. He was again mayor from 1852‚Äì54. He was elected into the South Australian Legislative Council in 1853, becoming Speaker of the South Australian Legislative Council (1855‚Äì56), and upon self-government, President of the South Australian Legislative Council (1857‚Äì65), after which he retired from politics. In 1860 he was made Knight Bachelor, becoming the first resident South Australian to be knighted. Death Fisher died in Adelaide on 28 January 1875, survived by four sons and four daughters. Family James married Elizabeth Johnson (1792 ‚Äì 2 July 1857). Among their children were: *Elizabeth \\"Bessey\\" Fisher (15 April 1815 ‚Äì 1905) married John Morphett on 15 August 1838. *James Fisher (1816‚Äì1913), pastoralist.

Shipster, but the wedding had to be cancelled due to his illness; he died the following day. Shipster's late wife Emma was closely related to Adelaide's Dr. John Palmer Litchfield, Thomas Reynolds and Dr. Ruby Davy. J. H. Fisher brought up and educated his young son. She later married John Vidal James (1820‚Äì1897), pioneer settler at Inman Valley and Willunga, later Colonial Storekeeper. They returned to England in 1855. *George William Taylor Fisher (1825 ‚Äì 6 August 1859) lost in the wrecking of *Marianne Fisher (5 February 1827 ‚Äì 18 June 1927), last surviving emigrant *William Dundas Fisher (1829 ‚Äì 2 December 1886) married Sarah Melville on 27 July 1859, died at South Yarra. *Hurtle Eyles Fisher (c. 1831 ‚Äì 30 June 1905) survived the wrecking of SS Admella to become a prominent Victorian horse breeder who brought Fisherman to Australia, and whose Lantern won the 1864 Melbourne Cup. *Emily Ann Fisher (1837‚Äì ) married Joseph Palmer on 10 November 1855. Memorials James Hurtle Fisher is commemorated in various ways: * Hurtle Square, Adelaide is named after him * A memorial plaque exists at Holy Trinity Church (then Trinity Church), of which he was one of the first trustees * His portrait is preserved at Parliament House, Adelaide A memorial and plaque near the corner of North Terrace and West Terrace, Adelaide, marks the approximate location of the Land and Survey offices and Fisher's and Colonel William Light's huts, which were destroyed by fire in 1839.

He served as the first Ambassador of Cape Verde to Portugal from 1975 until 1981 following his country's independence. Biography Fortes was born in Mindelo on Cape Verde's S√£o Vicente island in 1933. He is a graduate in law of the University of Lisbon (1966), chaired the Association of Cape Verde Writers (2003-2006) and is the author of some of the most significant works of Cape Verdean literature.

He was a judge in Angola in the capital Luanda and Benguela and joined several governments in the Cape Verde Republic.http://www.antoniomiranda.com.br/poesia_africana/cabo_verde/corsino_fortes.html He represented the PAICV. Corsino Fortes's first book P√£o & Fonema (Bread & Phoneme), which appeared in 1974, made an immediate impact. 1974 was a momentous year for Portugal and its African colonies as it was the year in which the authoritarian Estado Novo regime was overthrown, an act which began the process that led to the decolonisation of the Cape Verde Islands in 1975. Not long after he was the first Cape Verdean ambassador to Portugal for a year. He became the first ever Cape Verdean ambassador to France on August 25, 1976 and served until December 2, 1981 which was succeeded by Andr√© Corsino Tolentino. When Corsino Fortes was deputy secretary to the Prime MInister and Minister of Social Communications, he inspired a television model of Iceland in which television stations existed and operated in small cities and proved the experimental mode for the country's model, a few years before RTC started television broadcasting in 1997. After P√£o & Fonema he published Arvore e Tambor (Tree and Drum) in 1986. Both P√£o e Fonema and √Årvore e Tambor expressed a new conscience of reality in Cape Verde and a new traditional and cultural works on the archipelago. He finished what he had long seen as a trilogy in 2001 with Pedras de Sol & Subst√¢ncia which was collected with the previous two books under the title A Cabe√ßa Calva de Deus (The bald head of God), they were sagas on the freedom to the people.Revista S√°bado (Saturday Review), no. 587, 30 July - 5 August 2015 Sinos de Silencio was his very last book published in 2015.

The northern part of the association contains the greatest concentration of Christian-heritage congregations in the Ohio Conference, many having been founded by settlers from North Carolina and Kentucky in the 1810s and 1820s. Some of the Cincinnati-area congregations were started originally as Evangelical Protestant churches, a German-language free-church movement that first appeared in the Pittsburgh, Pa. area in the early 19th century. In 1925, this small group joined the Congregational Christian Churches; some of its churches were also located in Indiana and St. Louis in addition to Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.

Not only did churches prosper in the settlement, but other institutions bearing the Congregationalist stamp such as Oberlin College, one of the U.S.' first coeducational places of higher learning, as well. In the years preceding the Civil War, pastors and laity often became staunch proponents for the abolition of slavery; some devoted missionaries went to the South after the war to teach newly emancipated African-Americans, under the auspices of the American Missionary Association Many, if not most, churches in this five-county association (Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, and Lorain) carry on much of that politically and socially progressive mission and advocacy to this day. Moreover, the E&R-heritage; congregations in the region were generally less inclined toward traditionalism than those elsewhere in Ohio, adding their ethnic flavor to a quintessential \\"Yankee\\" church. The association's territory encompasses virtually all of the Cleveland metropolitan area. Because Cleveland houses the national headquarters of the UCC, many of the ordained staff members there hold their ministerial standing in this association. *Congregational, Amherst (CC) *St. Peter's, Amherst (E&R;) *First Congregational, Andover (CC) *First, Austinburg (CC) *UCC, Avon Lake (CC) *South Haven, Bedford (CC) *First Congregational, Berea (CC) *UCC, Brecksville (CC)* *UCC, Brooklyn (CC) *UCC, Brooklyn Heights (CC) *Congregational, Burton (CC) *Auburn Community, Chagrin Falls (CC) *Bainbridge Community, Chagrin Falls (UCC) *Federated, Chagrin Falls (CC) *Pilgrim Christian, Chardon (CC) *Community, Chesterland (CC)* *First Congregational, Claridon (CC) *Archwood, Cleveland (CC, E&R; union)* *Bethany, Cleveland (E&R;) *Denison Avenue, Cleveland (CC) *Euclid Avenue Congregational, Cleveland (CC)* *Friedens, Cleveland (E&R;) *La Iglesia Unida de Cristo, Cleveland (UCC; Spanish language parish) *Mt.

M√©nard also worked with the Iroquois, and was said to speak six Indian dialects.Kellogg, Louise P., \\"The First Missionary in Wisconsin\\", The Wisconsin Magazine of History, Volume 4, number 4, June 1921. He survived the continuous attacks from the Iroquois on the Huron. Biography M√©nard joined the Jesuits on 7 September 1624 in Paris. After the usual course of studies at La Fl√®che, Bourges, and Orleans, he set out from Dieppe in the beginning of May, 1640. Arriving at Qu√©bec he was assigned to work among the Hurons, laboring first, however, among the Nippissings.Campbell, Thomas. \\"Ren√© M√©nard.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10.

The 55-year-old M√©nard didn't expect to return. The night before departure he wrote to a friend, \\"In three or four months you may include me in the Memento for the dead, in view of the kind of life led by these peoples, of my age, and of my delicate constitution. In spite of that, I have felt such powerful promptings and have seen in this affair so little of the purely natural, that I could not doubt if I failed to respond to this opportunity that I should experience an endless remorse.\\" Leaving Trois- Rivi√®res, Qu√©bec at the end of August, they paddled for six weeks up the St. Lawrence, up the Ottawa River, and across Georgian Bay. The party didn't go easy on the frail Father. Separated from the French traders and his assistant, he was forced to paddle continuously and carry heavy loads with meager rations. When they passed Sault Ste. Marie into Lake Superior, Father M√©nard had penetrated further into the Great Lakes region than any Western official before.Schmirler, A. A. A., \\"Wisconsin's Lost Missionary: The Mystery of Father Rene Menard\\", The Wisconsin Magazine of History, Volume 45, number 2, winter, 1961-1962. After his party's canoe was destroyed by a falling tree in mid-October, M√©nard wintered with some Ottawas at Keweenaw Bay near what is now L'Anse, Michigan. He sheltered in a hut he made of tree branches and at times he subsisted on fish begged from the Indians and boiled moss. Despite the hardships and resistance from many Indians, he baptized and taught the Christian faith.\\"A priest journeys to a Wisconsin village of exiled Hurons in 1661.\\" Wisconsin Historical Society. This page links to translations of M√©nard's final letters. In the spring he heard that a band of Hurons in the interior was starving, and he set off to minister to them, though he himself had only a bag of sturgeon and some dried meat. He and a fur trader nicknamed L'Esperance walked and canoed down into what is believed to be present-day Taylor County in north central Wisconsin. At a rapids a day's journey from the Huron village, M√©nard, now weak with hunger himself, became separated from his companion, and disappeared. His cassock and breviary were later found among the Dakotas. Bishop Laval of Qu√©bec wrote of M√©nard and the fur traders, \\"Seven Frenchmen attached themselves to this Apostle, they to catch beavers, he to gain souls.\\" A roadside sign in Iron County, Michigan, along the Michigamme River claims Father M√©nard died there on July 4, 1661.

The island, which has an area of 0.05 km¬≤, is officially a neighbourhood in the Adalar district of Istanbul, Turkey. Sivriada was often used by the Byzantine clerics as a distant place for peaceful worship, and by the Byzantine emperors as a convenient prison to detain prominent people whom they deemed troublesome. The first famous person to be imprisoned in the island by the order of emperor Nikephoros I was Plato of Sakkoudion, the uncle of renowned cleric Theodoros Stoudites, for supporting his nephew in his conflict with the emperor. Other famous people who stayed in the island for religious and political reasons were Gebon, Basil Skleros, Nikephoritzes (the chief minister of Michael VII Doukas), Patriarch John of Constantinople and Patriarch Michael II of Constantinople. The graves of those who died on the island during the Byzantine period can still be seen today. The ruins of a Roman settlement and a 9th-century Byzantine monastery can still be seen on the shore, close to the fishermen's shelter, a small wharf which is often used by yachts. The most important buildings on the island were built in the 9th century AD, including a church, a chapel dedicated to religious martyrs, a monastery on the eastern end (with its walls still seen today) and a cistern in the center of the island (a part of which can still be seen). In 1911, in an event called \\"Hayƒ±rsƒ±zada Dog Massacre\\", the Governor of Istanbul ordered the stray dogs in the streets to be rounded up and exiled to Sivriada. About 80,000 dogs were killed during the ordeal, mostly due to hunger and thirst on the barren land of the island, and some due to drowning as they tried to escape the horrible conditions of the island. A severe earthquake which immediately followed the event was perceived by the local as \\"a punishment by God for abandoning the dogs.\\" That is why the island is known both as Sivriada and Hayƒ±rsƒ±zada (\\"the inauspicious island\\").

Harvey was born at Barnwell, Cambridgeshire. He started his first-class career playing one game for Marylebone Cricket Club against Scotland in 1961. In 1962 he umpired two matches for MCC. He was picked up by Derbyshire in 1963 season and, after three matches, made his debut in that year's County Championship against Somerset. He scored a century against Kent in his second Championship match. Though his average fluctuated over following seasons, he continued to perform well throughout the mid-1960s. In the 1966 season he was the only Derbyshire player to score a century in the Championship, and in the 1967 season he scored his best season average. One fine innings was at Chesterfield in the 1968 season when he scored 92 as Derbyshire lost by only eight runs to the touring Australians. With one season out of the game during his eleven-year spell, Harvey saw the team through some tough times, heading the opening order on his peak form, but happy to perform in the middle order when his form was suffering. Harvey was released from Derbyshire in a shake-up in the 1972 season. He put in one-day appearances for Minor Counties North and Cambridgeshire in 1975 and for Minor Counties East in 1976. Harvey was a right-handed batsman and played 344 innings in 206 first-class games with an average of 24.16 and a top score of 168. He also played 81 innings in 84 one- day matches. He was a right-arm offbreak bowler and took one first-class wicket at the cost of 71 runs and one in one day cricket.John Harvey at Cricket Archive Harvey became coach and groundsman at Bradfield College, and started playing for Berkshire in 1978. He was captain of Berkshire in 1980 and represented them until the age of 46, in the Minor Counties Championship. Harvey's approach at Bradfield was appreciated by the boys over his 25 years there.

Currently, only small number of Veprs are used by the Ukrainian security service. Design Although the Vepr has been proclaimed as a revolutionary upgrade to the AK-74, it is, in fact, an interesting yet fairly simple modification of the basic AK-74 system in a bullpup design, with the following modifications: *The standard gas- operated, rotating-bolt AK-74 mechanism is removed from its furniture and a new butt plate is mounted directly on the rear of the receiver. *A polymer cheek rest is fitted to the receiver cover. *The trigger and pistol grip are placed in front of the magazine. *The cocking handle is removed from the bolt carrier and a new cocking handle arrangement is placed on the left side of the forearm. Common characteristics with the AK-74 The weapon still fires 5.45√ó39mm ammunition from 30-round magazines at an approximate rate of fire of 600 to 650 rounds per minute, the barrel length remains the same and the muzzle brake has been retained, which suggests that the Vepr's ballistic performance should be identical to that of the AK-74. The weapon's weight is almost the same as that of the AK-74M variant, and its length is comparable to that of a folding-stock AK with the stock folded. The main advantage of the bullpup layout thus lies in the fact that the weapon becomes much shorter and thus easier to store, to carry and to handle in confined spaces. However, the bullpup's overall superiority to conventional rifle configurations, in which the magazine and chamber are in front of the trigger and pistol grip rather than behind, has yet to be seen. Right-handed use The Vepr's only serious readily-visible drawback seems to be the fact that its layout, as that of the British SA80, does not favour ambidextrous operation, for three reasons: *Like the AK-74, the weapon still ejects to the right, which becomes a problem because a right-ejecting bullpup weapon, held left-handed, presents the ejection port directly against the operator's face; *Notably, the standard Kalashnikov-type combined safety lever / fire selector lever arrangement has not been revised. In the original weapon, the selector lever was noted for its relatively uncommon safe-auto-semi options sequence (rather than the typical safe-semi-auto), but the only real problems were that the lever was made infamous for its characteristic \\"Kalashnikov Clack\\" and it could not be operated without letting go of either the pistol grip or the forearm. The use of the same selector lever in a bullpup configuration adds further problems: the lack of any other form of fire selector device, which would ideally be placed as close to the trigger as possible, results in awkward handling with the weapon shouldered, especially when holding it left-handed; *The charging handle is still placed to one side, now favouring right-handed operators but making it difficult to work the cocking handle with the right hand while holding the weapon left-handed. Accessories The Vepr includes adjustable open sights and a conventional side mount, on the left, for day or night scopes. The front sight is strikingly similar to that of the American M16 series of rifles. A relatively large red dot sight of Ukrainian production can also be fitted as standard. The latest versions of the Vepr also include an integral 40mm underslung grenade launcher, with a dual trigger layout in which the front trigger fires the grenade launcher and the rear trigger fires the rifle.

He played most of his career with the BC Lions, where he has been part of two Grey Cup championship teams (94th Grey Cup and 99th Grey Cup) and was the last remaining active Lions player from the 2006 roster that won the 2006 Grey Cup. He holds numerous Lions franchise records and had been named a western all-star five times and a league all-star four times.BC Lions records Phillips was known for his durability, having only missed four games in his 12-year career which includes a consecutive games-played streak of 181 games. He was also a member of the Montreal Alouettes in 2017. He is a 2006 graduate of Eastern Washington University which is also where he played college football for the Eastern Washington Eagles. College football career Phillips played high school football at Franklin High in his home town of Seattle. Following graduation in 2000, Phillips played junior college football at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut, California. Phillips played college football as a defensive back, running back, and kick returner at Eastern Washington University. As a senior, Phillips was named to the first- team All-Big Sky Conference as a cornerback and kick returner. Phillips had 5 interceptions, 16 kick returns for 330 yards (a 20.6 yard average) during his senior year for the Eagles, and in 2003, rushed for 85 yards on 11 carries (a 7.7 yard average), with 3 receptions for 17 yards. Professional football career =BC Lions= Following a free agent camp in Portland, Oregon, Phillips joined the BC Lions for the 2005 season. He started all 18 games during his rookie season where he recorded 56 tackles, good for third on the team, as well as three interceptions. In 2006, Phillips moved from his defensive halfback position to the defense's nickel back for all 18 regular season games. Phillips recorded 23 defensive tackles, five special teams tackles, two interceptions (one for a 23-yard touchdown), two fumble recoveries and 3 pass knockdowns. Phillips added the Lions sole interception in the Western Division Championship game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders, and chipped in three tackles in the Lion's 2006 Grey Cup victory over the Montreal Alouettes. In 2007, Phillips led the CFL with 12 interceptions, tying a team record held by former Lions defensive back, Larry Crawford, in the process. He also set a franchise record for most interception return yards in a season with 299 yards. The previous record had been 188. He also recorded the most tackles in his career with 65 made that year. At the conclusion of the season, Phillips was named a CFL All-Star for the first time in his career. 2008 was a stark contrast to the previous year as Phillips recorded only one interception in 18 games. The following year, he bounced back with four interceptions while recording the first fumble-return touchdown of his career, in addition to his third career interception return touchdown. In 2010 he recorded his highest sack tally to date with four for the year, to accompany another five interceptions with 49 tackles. Subsequently, he earned his second CFL All-Star selection that year. Phillips was part of the 2011 BC Lions team that began the year with five consecutive losses and finished to win the 99th Grey Cup in Vancouver, which had never been done before in CFL history. During the season, he recorded 46 defensive tackles with four interceptions and one interception return touchdown. He had two tackles in the Western Final that year and one in the Grey Cup game itself as he won his second Grey Cup championship. For the 2012 and 2013 seasons, Phillips earned All-Star selections in both years while fostering his reputation as an excellent coverage defensive back. He recorded four interceptions with 32 defensive tackles in 2012 and two interceptions with 36 defensive tackles in 2013. In 2014, he added another three interceptions to his tally while registering 36 defensive tackles. For the 2015 season, Phillips led the league with six interceptions and made 26 defensive tackles in just 14 games. For the first time in his professional career, he did not play in a game, ending his consecutive games-played streak at 181 games. Despite playing in only 14 games, Phillips was named to the 2015 CFL Western All-Star team for the fifth time in his career. He scored his fifth career interception return touchdown in a game against the Montreal Alouettes on August 20, 2015, which tied for the franchise record for interception return touchdowns. He also set the franchise record for defensive touchdowns with six total, including his fumble return touchdown in 2008. He finished the season tied for the franchise record for most interception return yards with Larry Crawford who also had 790 yards. In 2016, Phillips set the franchise record for most interception return yards in a career after his 26-yard return against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, on July 1, 2016, brought him to 816 yards total. He played in his 200th career game on August 4, 2016 against the Alouettes, which is the sixth-most games played in BC Lions' history.Lions wrap up three-game road swing in Montreal Phillips was signed through the 2017 CFL season with the Lions after he signed a contract extension on January 24, 2016.Phillips in orange through 2017 Nevertheless, at age 34, he was released by the Lions on February 10, 2017, just prior to the opening of the free agency period. =Montreal Alouettes= Shortly after his release from BC, Phillips signed with the Montreal Alouettes on February 15, 2017.The Alouettes sign four-time CFL All-Star Ryan Phillips He dressed in two games for the Alouettes, recording eight tackles, but was released on July 16, 2017.Alouettes' transactions - July 16 Personal life In addition to being a professional football player, Phillips is a high school teacher in the Seattle school system during the off season.

As a Marxist group with Communist sympathies, it tried not just to create more employment opportunities for psychologists, but also to work towards the establishment of non-capitalist institutions that would assure the proper social utilization of psychologists. Yet although the Psychologists League did manage to create some job opportunities for psychologists, especially through the Works Progress Administration, in its more ambitious goals it proved to be less successful. In fact its influence on the policies of the American Psychological Association was largely negligible.

It serves 950 students from the predominantly rural towns of Mentz, Montezuma, Throop, and Conquest. Residents of these towns live in the Port Byron and Auburn postal areas. The Port Byron Central School District operates the A.A. Gates Elementary School (NCES School ID ) and the Dana L. West Junior/Senior High School.(NCES School ID ) Both schools are connected through a series of hallways. The complex, which includes athletic fields, is located on the east side of the Village of Port Byron. Athletics Port Byron's mascot is the black panther, their team colors are maroon and white, and the main athletic rival is Weedsport. Port Byron has played in many leagues over the years such as the Tri-County League and the Onondaga High School League (OHSL) Southern Division. Today, the Panthers play in the Section 3 Patriot League. The Panthers have had many winning seasons. Football Port Byron was a powerhouse in football throughout the career of legendary coach Gino Alberici, a 32-year veteran at the school, who retired in 1993. Alberici began his career on the 1953 undefeated football team at Auburn High School and was named to the All-American football team that same year. He was a Social Studies teacher, soccer, football and basketball coach at Port Byron during his 32-year run. During which time his teams won a total of 167 games and 13 league titles. In Alberici's final coaching season, the Panther's went 7-1. Alberici's retirement was a big loss to the district. The Panthers are big in spirit and pride and currently rebuilding. Baseball 1977 produced an undefeated season (12-0) in the Onondaga High School League (OHSL) Southern Division. They also took a first-place finish over all schools in all of Onondaga County and placed seven out of 11 players on the All-Star Team that season. Tennis The 1980 tennis team won their first championship in the OHSL Southern Division. Track The 1980 track team enjoyed being co- champions of the OHSL Southern Division with several athletes being Class \\"C\\" champions in their events. The Port Byron All Stars Cross Country 1990-1991 Team, led by captain Thomas Guy, had the privilege of bringing back the Section-A All American Varsity trophy of the 1990 fall season, and the financial disbursement back to Port Byron from NYS has kept the district operating at a minimal level ever since. Music Port Byron's school alma mater \\"Hail to Port Byron\\" was composed by Elvin Freeman, who had a distinguished career. He was a member of the military band at West Point, a member of the John Philip Sousa Band as well as being an instructor of the Syracuse University Band. Freeman also was a composer and for Port Byronites, his most important work will always be \\"Hail to Port Byron.\\" The band was active in the New York State School Music Association (NYSSMA) performing level 1 and 2 in the festivals. Today, only sixth-grade students are eligible for NYSSMA participation in All State. Port Byron has been represented at this level for All State Choir, Wind Ensemble and Concert Band by a select group of students. The music program at Port Byron experienced monumental growth from 1975 to 1979 under the direction of Jonathan Bowen. Students participated in NYSSMA solo competitions in record numbers. The Port Byron Marching Panthers band (by audition) was selected to march down Main Street U.S.A., Disney Land, Florida. The group at this time consisted of 96 members between the band and colorguard. They also competed in the Seneca Falls Pageant of Bands as well as others events across New York State. The Port Byron Marching Panthers hold a unique record that is likely never to be repeated, except by Nik Doerle, who plays trumpet at the school. On October 21, 1977, (by invitation) the Marching Panthers provided the half-time show on Weedsport's field for the 1977 OHSL playoffs.

Humphreys (March 11, 1816 ‚Äì July 18, 1900) was a physician and the founder of Humphreys Homeopathic Medicine Company in New York City in 1853. Biography Frederick was born in Marcellus, New York, on March 11, 1816 to Erastus Humphreys (1785‚Äì1848), a physician. Frederick was raised in Auburn, New York, where he went to the Auburn Academy. In 1832 he joined his uncle and brother in their clock business. In 1835 he returned home to manage his father's farm. In 1837, at the age of 21, he married Cornelia Palmer (c 1816‚Äì1840), and they moved to Chillicothe, Ohio, where Cornelia's father lived. In Chillicothe Frederick entered the Methodist Episcopal ministry. His wife died in 1840 and Fredrick returned to Auburn as an itinerant preacher. On August 1, 1843, Frederick married his second wife, Frances Maria Sperry (1826‚Äì1902) of Ludlowville, Tompkins County, New York. They had the following children: Helen Frances Humphreys (1844‚Äì?); Frederick Hahnemann Humphreys (1847‚Äì1919); Alvah Jay Sperry Humphreys (1851‚Äì1884) who was the father of Frederick Erastus Humphreys; and Frank Landon Humphreys (1858‚Äì?). He was the personal physician of Theron T. Pond (?‚Äì1852), and Humphreys claimed that Pond gave him permission to manufacture Pond's Creams before he died. Humphreys began to manufacture the product under the name \\"Pond's Extract\\". Palmer, who took over the Pond's corporation, received an injunction from Humphrey using the name 'Pond's Extract' or manufacturing the cream. Around 1871 the lawsuit of Palmer vs. Humphrey was still pending, when F. W. Hurtt, a banker of New York, bought the alleged rights from Humphrey Homeopathic Medicine Company, and took Palmer into the new partnership, giving him a one-eighth interest in the new corporation. Frederick Humphreys died in 1900 in Monmouth Beach, New Jersey, and he was buried in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn.The first in the family to the United States was Michael Humphrey who lived in Windsor, Connecticut in 1640.

History  ABC Railway's beginnings trace back to the organization of the Akron and Barberton Belt Railroad (ABB) which had been formed in the late 19th century. ABB owned of track in and around Akron, Ohio. By the 1980s, ABB's traffic had fallen due to a lack of business in the tire industry in Akron. In 1994, the new Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway purchased the ABB. After the ICC and W&LE; signed an agreement and contract in 1993, W&LE; made arrangements to form a new railroad in Akron using the former ABB as its basis. In early 1994, WE created Akron Barberton Cluster Railway (ABCR) from the former ABB assets. It also included the former Erie main line from Barberton to Rittman and from Kent to Ravenna, Ohio sold by Conrail. In 1997, ABCR was granted permission to tear out 45% the former ABB \\"Loop\\" line which looped from the grade in Barberton and Firestone Park to the WE's Brittain Yard in Akron. In 1999, ABCR took the line out of service, and in 2001, they tore the line out completely with expenses paid off by parent railroad company, WE.  Current system  ABCR has trackage rights on CSX's New Castle Subdivision from the yard in Akron south to Barberton, where it swings off around their headquarters area. ABCR is headquartered in a small building off a local road in Barberton, Ohio. ABCR uses the restored Erie Railroad line from Barberton to Rittman, Ohio. In 2002, the railroad acquired the line to the General Electric factory in northern Ravenna, Ohio. ABCR has purchased trackage rights with METRO Regional Transit Authority in 2006, to connect to the Canton area.

Cleveland has been and continues to be deeply rooted in railroad history. History =Early history= Cleveland railroading began in the 19th century when the New York Central and Nickel Plate Road (New York, Chicago, & St. Louis) built two major lines along Lake Erie that handled major traffic per day, and had major yards on them at this point. The line that became part of the New York Central was originally the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad. This later became part of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (LS&MS;). This is the source of the Amtrak train name, \\"The Lake Shore Limited\\", that still operates through Cleveland in the middle of the night. The Nickel Plate Road, (NYC&St.L;) came along later as \\"That nickel-plated air line\\", and was financed by Jay Gould, of the notorious Gould Syndicate, which was one of the fast and furiously competitive rail entities of the day. NKP's line bridged over the NYC's line in the western part of Cleveland, and the NYC line wyed in the mid-Cleveland area. One leg of the wye was an entity of NYC, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis (named Big Four). The Nickel Plate Road was bought by the New York Central to eliminate it from competition - which is what Gould intended. The interstate Commerce Commission forced the New York Central to sell off the Nickel Plate, and one of the Central's operating men took it over after assurances that the Central would \\"give him a free hand\\" in running it, and it improved considerably after that transition occurred. The C.C.C. & St. L, known as \\"The Big Four\\", was totally independent and later became a part of the New York Central System. The line began at Front Street, near Lake Erie, and at various times had a wye track connecting to the New York Central, just a little west of the current Amtrak station building. Erie passenger trains also used this line to reach the Erie station which was more-or-less beneath the Cleveland Union Terminal viaduct, that heads west paralleling Columbus Road, and then crossing the Cuyahoga River on a ballasted deck Warren Truss bridge. The RTA 9th street light rail line now runs over part of this line to reach its connection into the \\"Terminal Tower\\" from the west approach. The Big Four ran southwest past the present Cleveland Airport area to Galion, where it divided, with one branch running to Columbus and Cincinnati, and the other going to Indianapolis and St. Louis. Two principal New York Central passenger trains covered these routes, although there were many others. The Southwestern Limited joined two sections from Boston and Manhattan in Albany, and traveled through Cleveland to St. Louis, and the Ohio State Limited ran from Grand Central Terminal (GCT) in Manhattan through Cleveland to Columbus and Cincinnati. Westbound it did not stop in Cleveland, due to the middle-of-the night schedule, but eastbound it did. CCC&StL; and the NYC came close to one another and paralleled each other for one mile (1.6 km) west of Cleveland in Berea. After this point, the CCC&StL; continued southwest to Cincinnati and the NYC continued west to Toledo. There were high-speed crossovers at this point where the passenger trains heading west from the Cleveland Union Terminal (C.U.T./Terminal Tower) could cross over from the line paralleling the Big Four to the New York Central if they were continuing west to Toledo, Detroit and/or Chicago, and the same for eastbound trains. The NKP line continued west to Bellevue where they had a major hump classification yard, then continued west through Fostoria to Fort Wayne, IN. The Nickel Plate Road also owned two other lines to the west of Cleveland - the Cloverleaf, and the Lake Erie and Western. The Cloverleaf was the route from Toledo to St. Louis, and the L.E. & W. - nicknamed \\"Leave Early and Walk\\" - went from Sandusky to Peoria. In practice, the Cleveland to St. Louis passenger trains ran on the NKP to Arcadia, then southwest on the L.E. & W. to Frankfort, Indiana, and thence over the Cloverleaf to St. Louis. To the east, The NKP ran to Buffalo, New York, where connection was made with the Lackawanna Railroad (Delaware, Lackawanna and Western) - later part of the Erie-Lackawanna, and thus NKP traffic could continue on to Hoboken, New Jersey. The New York and Erie Railroad, or \\"ERIE\\", was originally chartered to run through and connect only with railroads in New York State, which limited its ambitions, and it originally reached Buffalo, New York. Later it came under the control of the Gould Syndicate and for a time was known as \\"The Scarlet Woman of Wall Street.\\" It even was mentioned as a joking reference in Horatio Alger's rags- to-riches book, \\"Ragged Dick\\". The Cleveland connection was chartered in 1848 as the Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad. The Erie main line ran from a major division point in Meadville, Pennsylvania to Youngstown, Ohio, and then westward through Akron to Chicago. Later, a cut-off was built between Shenango, Pennsylvania and Leavittsburg, Ohio, and the Cleveland - Youngstown line crossed it there. The route through Youngstown was referred to by train crews as \\"the back door\\". Erie traffic moved from Youngstown to Pittsburgh over the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie, which was part of the New York Central System, and that line ended in Connelsville, Pennsylvania. In the early days, traffic continued over the Western Maryland to Baltimore, but later, it moved over the Baltimore and Ohio, giving access to Washington D.C. After these three divisions built through Cleveland, a commuter line (somewhat like a trolley/street car) called the \\"Cleveland Union Terminal Railroad\\" (CUT) built around the downtown area of Cleveland. NYC had joint ownership of this railroad three years after its formation. The Cleveland Union Terminal Project was conceived of by the Van Sweringen brothers, who developed Shaker Heights, and built what became the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit. They owned the Nickel Plate, the Pere Marquette, and the Chesapeake and Ohio railroads at this time. The C.U.T. was intended to bring the railroads into Cleveland's Public Square, and this benefited the Nickel Plate because it stayed on the higher ground and did not descend to the lakefront. Only the Pennsylvania Railroad (Cleveland and Pittsburgh) stayed out of this arrangement, retaining their uptown station at E.55th Street and Euclid Avenue. The C.U.T. ran under overhead, or \\"trolly wire\\" electrification with heavy P-1a 4-C+C-4 double-ended \\"motors\\" equipped with pantographs - the same wheel arrangement that was later used on the famous P.R.R. GG-1's. The line started at Collinwood on the east end, where the steam locomotives were removed, and ran about 17 miles to Linndale, on the west side. The electrification ended there, and steam locomotives took over the westbound trains again at that point. The actual line continued to Berea, where it could join either the Big 4 or the New York Central, depending on the destination. The Nickel Plate accessed the C.U.T. trackage at E. 34th street on the east approach, and at W. 30th St. on the west approach. The B&O; and the Erie eventually entered the C.U.T. from the east approach after dieselization, at which time the electrification was removed, and the \\"motors\\" were sent to work in Grand Central Station in New York City, after being converted to third rail operation, and designated as P-2b's. The stub of the Wheeling and Lake Erie connection remained under the Eagle Avenue Viaduct until track removal began in the Penn Central era, but it was never used. The Erie-Lackawanna commuter train to Youngstown, Ohio was the last train to use the C.U.T., arriving and departing weekdays from Track 14. The last eastbound run was on January 14, 1977, and track removal was begun immediately after the final departure The Cleveland Union Terminal had a total of 37 tracks at one time, arranged as two stub-end tracks (1&2) for the Shaker Rapid Transit, used as storage, 3&4 for eastbound Shaker Rapid departure, 5 which was occasionally used the same way during rush hour or public events, like Cleveland Browns football games, 6 which was used for storage, and 7 which was the Shaker Rapid arrival track. This went west under the Cleveland Sheraton Hotel and a parking structure to a turning loop that led back around to tracks 3 and 4. Tracks 8,9 and 10 were used by the CTS line from Windemere in East Cleveland to the Cleveland Airport extension. A complicated track structure under the Ontario Street subway allowed CTS eastbound trains to cross above the depressed westbound CTS and Shaker track to proceed eastward, as they ran left-hand until they reached the Northern Ohio Traction junction, where the Shaker Rapid shops were, and the two lines diverged and continued separately. Railroad passenger tracks were arranged in pairs from 11 & 12 through 21 & 22\\\\. There was a stub-end switch engine, or \\"depot motor\\" lead that could hold two engines in between tracks 15 and 16 on the east approach, visible between Huron and Prospect roads above. On the west end, there were two longer stub- end tracks that could hold one switch engine each, but were also used for mail cars under the U.S. Post Office building. Track 23 was a \\"running track\\", and had a platform on each side, and a chalkboard for the \\"Pullman Line\\", so crews knew which cars went to which trains when sleeping cars were switched into through trains. An additional set of coach yard tracks, named 1 through 9 (but really 24 to 32) filled the remaining space, with narrow service platforms between each track. An automatic car-washer stood on coach yard track 5. At the extreme west approach, just in from the viaduct, there were two more stub- end tracks that led into the car shop and the wheel lathe house. This has all been replaced by a parking lot, except for three rapid transit or \\"light rail\\" tracks, which have been moved south from their original positions into the tracks 11-13 area. The rapid transit storage and service has been moved to the former Orange Avenue Fruit Terminal yard, which is where the original C.U.T. coach yard would have been moved to if the Wheeling and Lake Erie and the Pennsylvania Railroad had required their own space in the terminal. Another short line conglomerate system built around in a loop shape near downtown called the Newburgh & South Shore Railroad (N&SS;). Back in those times, what is now \\"Harvard\\" was called \\"Newburgh.\\" With now nearly of track in and around the downtown Cleveland area, the Erie Railroad thought they ought to step in, which they did, purchasing of property, and built a line from Cleveland to Connellsville, PA (just south of Pittsburgh). Wheeling & Lake Erie came into town about a year later with their line that ran south to Canton. At this time, Cleveland's industrial environment had seen a good upgrade with a lot of railroads serving the area. The Wheeling and Lake Erie (W. & L.E.) was on a 99-year lease to the Nickel Plate railroad, and thus came under control of the Norfolk and Western, and then the new Norfolk Southern system. The original line was variously the Cleveland, Canton and Southern, among other names, and joined the actual W. & L.E. in Brewster, Ohio, south of Canton, where the W. & L.E. mainline crosses from Toledo in the northwest going to Martins Ferry, Ohio, across the Ohio River from Wheeling. Passenger trains operated until the 1930s from Cleveland to Zanesville, Ohio, and Martins Ferry. Parts of the railroad have been re-formed independently from Norfolk Southern and still operate as the W. & L.E. The railroad's own publicity states that plastics are now a major online freight source. Railroads built branch lines and industrial lines off of the main lines, and soon Cleveland had of track. By this time, Pennsylvania had built their line from Pittsburgh into town, and Baltimore and Ohio built a line north from central Akron into town. A shortline switching company, the \\"River Terminal\\" railroad, was formed. =1950 to 1990= In the early 1950s, NKP started to fail at business, and in 1964, N&W; bought the NKP. Now the NKP Lake line was in N&W;'s name, and N&W; cancelled many of their stops in Cleveland, which forced other railroads to have to make runs instead of N&W.; W&LE; acquired one of the runs, and B&O; acquired the other five. B&O; had nearly of track in the Cleveland corporation limits at this time. In 1967, NYC became PC, and then thought-to-be successful Penn Central canceled all of their stops in Cleveland, which put two factories in the hole. And one shut down completely. One industry refused an offer from River Terminal and Newburgh & South Shore. They offered immediate business. The factory still turned them down, and eventually, the lights faded in that industry. By this time, there were only a handful of industries left, when suddenly, a factory from \\"Whiskey Island\\" called B&O; up (which at the time was filing for bankruptcy to Chessie system) to make the runs. In 1971, B&O; made their first run to Whiskey Island, and the Island seemed really successful, until Chessie took charge in 1972. Chessie cancelled their stop there in 1975 after acquiring Western Maryland and obtaining more 'important' runs. PC went bankrupt to Conrail a year later in 1976, and Conrail was a bright future for Cleveland. They re-opened many of the runs in Cleveland, and acquired the train to Whiskey Island. Pretty soon, all you could find in Cleveland was Conrail. Conrail bought the CCC&StL;, the NYC, the Pennsylvania, and the Erie. Chessie was soon in competition with this and contacted many factories in Cleveland in search for trains to run, but it had seemed Conrail acquired all of them, the only Chessie run left, was the run to the dock facility near downtown, which was failing. An unmentioned N&W; line serving the dock was also in use, but failing severely. It wasn't long until the dock facilities went out, and N&W; and Chessie had no runs left in Cleveland. The Big Blue obtained N&SS; and RT in 1979, then re-opened all the shortline companies as one single entity known as \\"Cleveland Works Railway Organization\\" (CWRO). The CWRO consisted of the \\"Cuyahoga Valley Industrial Railroad, the Newburgh & South Shore, the River Terminal and the Cleveland Union Terminal. In 1980, Chessie was absorbed by CSX, and CSX opened one single line back to two tiny companies near the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland. CSX started making some money here, so they continued those runs. In 1982, the old N&W; line was acquired in the merger by NS. NS also had some success at finding a couple needy businesses near downtown Cleveland. This run stayed open. NS had spun off of track at this time, and a Class III bought it right up, without any engines or rolling stock, known as the \\"Flats Industrial\\" railroad corporation. FI arrived at an agreement and signed a contract with Conrail that they be under joint ownership with Conrail and the CWRO. FI was given one single SW1001 at the time, which is what they still have. In late 1982, CWRO and Conrail got a call from local Cleveland welding and iron ore companies and one dock facility. They asked if they could have the CWRO companies serve their industry, which ran for along the Cuyahoga River. They paid the CWRO $1.5 million up front. Of course, Conrail got a percentage of this money. The CWRO at this time was very successful, and bought 19 switcher locomotives which they keep based at the south end of the welding company. Conrail soon paid the welding company for an outdoor barn-sized storage building. After the arrangements were made, Conrail gave this building to CWRO for a fee of course, and made it CWRO's own, personal repair shops. In 1984, the Cleveland Union Terminal tracks were sold to the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) as a commuter business. =1990 to Present= In 1999, Conrail was split up on June 1 between NS and CSX. CSX got the former CCC&StL; trackage, and the former B&O; trackage. NS got the former NYC trackage and PRR trackage. the former N&W; trackage and the N&SS; trackage which it bought from the CWRO in 2000 for $2.2 million. Conrail The Conrail system in Cleveland featured a number of routes and secondary lines. The former New York Central Chicago Line was the primary east-west route through Cleveland, with the addition of the former Pennsylvania Railroad's Cleveland line allowing traffic to and from the Pittsburgh region to pass through to points near Buffalo or Chicago and Detroit. The Conrail system also included the former Big Four mainline, as well as New York Central Cleveland Short Line, which was a bypass around the congested downtown trackage. The Conrail system also included the Randall Secondary, which was the former Erie mainline into Cleveland. The Randall Secondary was in a steady decline under Conrail due to the lack of online business. The last train to the end of the line in Mantua was in the early 1990s. Until the Conrail split, the Randall Secondary saw occasional service to a frozen food plant in Solon, Ohio. In the late 1990s, Conrail began several large projects along their system in anticipation of the NS/CSX split. These projects included adding a second track to the 100+ year old Marcy Trestle over the Cuyahoga River, the restructuring of the interchange and diamond between the Big Four and Cleveland Short Line, and the addition of a second mainline track on the Big Four mainline from Berea south to the connection with the CSX (former B&O;) Chicago Line at Greenwich, Ohio. Cleveland Works Railway The ISG Cleveland Works Railway (CWRO) was created in 2002 as a terminal and switching railroad for International Steel Group's Cleveland Works steel mills. This railroad was created when ISG purchased and combined the assets from the River Terminal(RT)and Cuyahoga Valley (CUVA) Railways (not to be confused with the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railway). Both of these rail lines handled switching in and around the Cleveland steel mills and Sun Oil distribution center. Although the RT and CUVA Railways were out of the railroad business they continued to distribute benefits to former railway employees for years afterward. Norfolk Southern The Norfolk Southern system through Cleveland was fairly lean, consisting only of the former Nickel Plate mainline with some industry along the route. NS did not run any trains on the former Wheeling line, and sold the line to the new Wheeling and Lake Erie in 1990. The NS mainline through Lakewood, Ohio was the site of a heated battle between the railroad and the city over noise complaints. Lakewood features a large number of level grade crossings in very close proximity, each requiring a horn sounding. Through the 1990s, traffic levels dropped off, and then rebounded. The rebound in traffic caused alarm from citizens living near the tracks. Congressional representatives stepped in, and numerous ideas were floated to alleviate the complaints of the community. Ideas included increasing crossing safety to allow for horn-exempt crossings, and even fleet scheduling of trains to avoid excessive nighttime trains. The discussions continued well into the late 1990s, when the discussion about the Conrail breakup began. As a condition of the breakup, Norfolk Southern received the former New York Central Chicago Line from the downtown Cleveland drawbridge to points west. Using an upgraded interchange track between the Nickel Plate main and the former Big Four at a location known as Cloggsville, NS was able to route a majority of their trains off of the Nickel Plate and therefore avoiding the city of Lakewood, much to the relief of local citizens. During the Conrail breakup, Norfolk Southern received the former Pennsylvania Railroad mainline from Cleveland to Pittsburgh, the former New York Central mainline from the Cuyahoga River drawbridge west to Chicago, the Big Four mainline from DK Tower on the south side of downtown Cleveland to the connection with the Cleveland Short Line just east of Rockport Yard, which was also given to NS, and the former Erie mainline known to Conrail as the Randall Secondary. NS also received trackage rights over the Cleveland Short Line from the Harvard Connection west to Rockport Yard. In 2009, the Randall Secondary was leased to the Cleveland Commercial Railroad. Loads for customers are interchanged via the NS at the crossing and interchange track with the NS Cleveland Line. The Cleveland Commercial crews are based out of Glenwillow on the Wheeling and Lake Erie, but use a connection through a scrap dealer to transfer to the former Erie side of their operation. Newburgh & South Shore The Newburgh & South Shore has been owned by OmniTrax since the 1990s. The majority of the N&SS; operation revolves around their Marcelline Yard in Newburgh Heights, with switching duties at Charter Steel, formerly American Steel and Wire. Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway On May 17, 1990, the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway (1990) began operations over several hundred miles of secondary routes across Ohio previously owned by Norfolk Southern. This included the original Wheeling and Lake Erie Cleveland Line to Canton. Primary commodities shipped included coke and scrap metal. The Wheeling typically ran two turns into Cleveland each weekday. In 2001, citing economic downturn, LTV Steel decided to idle their Cleveland steel mills, which hurt business for the Wheeling, whose primary customer in Cleveland proper was the steel industry. In early 2002, the Wheeling embargoed the Cleveland Line from CP Harvard to the terminus at Campbell Yard. This line was shut down due to a combination of little traffic, increased wait times at the CP Harvard crossing with the NS (former Conrail) Cleveland Line, and subsequent vandalization of stopped trains at the Harvard crossing. The remaining Wheeling line was truncated into an interchange track with the NS Randall Secondary. In early 2002, the Independent Steel Group reopened the mills in Cleveland and once again requested coke trains from the Wheeling. The Wheeling decided to use trackage rights which were grandfathered to them from the original Wheeling and Lake Erie over the former Big Four line from Wellington to Cleveland. Wheeling continues to operate coke trains into Cleveland via Big Four trackage rights. =W&LE; Cleveland Line lease= In late 2002, the Wheeling began leasing the remainder of the Cleveland line from Glenwillow to the interchange track near CP Harvard to the Connotton Valley Railway. This line mostly hauled scrap metal and steel coils. The Connotton Valley ran for a few years, also running a weekend excursion train from the historic Bedford depot to Glenwillow depot and back. In 2004, the Connotton Valley Railway ceased operations, and the Wheeling leased the line to another new operator, the Cleveland Commercial Railroad. The Cleveland Commercial Railroad has had much more success than previous operator Connotton Valley, including the successful lease and operation of the Norfolk Southern Randall Secondary in 2009.

Born in Slough, Buckinghamshire, Busby signed professional forms with QPR in 1970 and made his debut in a 1‚Äì2 defeat against Leicester City in April 1970. He played midfield and was considered one of the brightest prospects that the QPR youth team had produced for many years. He began establishing himself in the first team towards the end of the 1971‚Äì72 season when he started the last fourteen matches. The 1972‚Äì73 season again saw him start every game until catastrophe struck in a game against Fulham at Craven Cottage in October. He suffered an extremely badly broken leg and it was thought at the time to be career-ending. After the best part of eighteen months out of the game he did return to play but was never quite the same player and remained only a fringe player until he moved to Portsmouth on loan for a spell in 1976. At the end of that season he was transferred to Notts County before rejoining Rangers in September 1977. He went on to play 146 league games for Rangers scoring 17 league goals in his 2 spells with the club. He retired in 1981 following an injury. He is the younger brother of former Fulham striker Viv Busby. He had a brief spell as joint manager of Maidenhead United with Alan Devonshire from June 1996 to March 1997.

The status was removed because of the protests of the Sambhaji Brigade, a Maratha group claiming that the status of Konddeo as the teacher of Shivaji was introduced by Brahmin historians.

Retrieved 4 September 2012. The bones were found near Pelican Rapids, Minnesota on June 16, 1931, during construction on U.S. Route 59. The bones were brought to Dr. Albert Jenks at the University of Minnesota, who identified them as the bones of a woman who was 15 or 16 years old, but who had never borne children. The woman had two artifacts‚Äîa dagger made from an elk's horn and a conch shell pendant. The conch shell came from a snail species known as Busycon perversum, which had previously only been known to exist in Florida. Discovery The road crew dug up the site without an investigation by archaeologists, so some of the exact details of the woman's death were hard to determine. The site indicated that the woman had not been ritually buried, and there was a thin layer of broken clam or mussel shells over the body. This led to the hypothesis that the woman had drowned, either by breaking through the ice or by falling off a boat, and that her body had been covered in mud at the bottom of a glacial lake. Before 1926, most scientists theorized that human beings had only appeared in America within the last couple of thousand years. The discovery of Minnesota Woman provided evidence that humans had been in America for many thousand years before that. Scientists now recognize the girl as someone whose ancestors were Paleo- Indian. Radiocarbon dating places the age of the bones approximately 8,000 years ago, approximately 7890 ¬±70 BP or near the beginning of the Archaic period in Minnesota. These skeletal remains have been reburied in South Dakota on October 2, 1999, by Sioux tribes and are not available for further study.

Meynert believed that disturbances in brain development could be a predisposition for psychiatric illness and that certain psychoses are reversible. In 1861 he earned his medical doctorate, and in 1875 became director of the psychiatric clinic associated with the University of Vienna. Some of his better known students in Vienna were Josef Breuer, Sigmund Freud, who in 1883 worked at Meynert's psychiatric clinic, and Julius Wagner-Jauregg, who introduced fever treatment for syphilis. Meynert later distanced himself from Freud because of the latter's involvement with practices such as hypnosis. Meynert also ridiculed Freud's idea of male hysteria; though some authors believe this to be due to his own hidden suffering of the illness, prompting a reconciliation with Freud near to his death.Fancher, R., E. (1996). Pioneers of Psychology (3rd eds). Norton and Company Inc., London/New York Other famous students of Meynert's were Russian neuropsychiatrist Sergei Korsakoff (1854‚Äì1900), German neuropathologist Carl Wernicke (1848‚Äì1905) and Swiss neuroanatomist Auguste- Henri Forel (1848‚Äì1931). Meynert's work was an important influence in the career of German neuropathologist Paul Flechsig (1847‚Äì1929).  Brain research  Meynert's work was largely focused on brain anatomy, pathology and histology, including the mapping of its intricate pathways and topography. He made many contributions involving the study of the cellular architecture of the brain and is often considered to be the founder of cerebral cortex cytoarchitectonics. Meynert developed theories in regards to correlations between neuroanatomical and mental processes. He conceptualized that a coupling between one mental association and its temporal successor as a literal contact between cortical nerve cells linked to one other by nerve fibers, and a series of cortical associations could therefore be construed as being a \\"train of thought\\". He also theorized that ideas and memories are to be envisioned as being attached to specific cortical cells. In regards to mental illness, Meynert conceptualized that a conflict existed between the cerebral cortex and the sub-cortical regions as the primary cause for abnormal function of cerebral components. Also he formulated that a causal connection existed between cerebral pathologies and psychoses due to a lack of \\"cerebral nutrition\\" related to vasomotor functionality.Answers.com; Theodor Meynert Meynert's aim was to establish psychiatry as an exact science based on anatomy. In his 1884 textbook Psychiatrie. Klinik der Erkrankungen des Vorderhirns, Meynert forewords with the statement: > \\"The reader will find no other definition of 'Psychiatry' in this book but > the one given on the title page: Clinical Treatise on Diseases of the > Forebrain. The historical term for psychiatry, i.e., 'treatment of the > soul,' implies more than we can accomplish, and transcends the bounds of > accurate scientific investigation.\\"Mental Illness as a \\"Brain Disease\\"  Anatomical terms  He has several anatomical structures named after him, including the basal optic nucleus of Meynert, the substantia innominata of Meynert and \\"Meynert cells\\", which are solitary pyramidal cells located in the cerebral cortex near the calcarine fissure. In 1869 Meynert described the dorsal tegmental decussation of the left and right tectospinal and tectobulbar tracts, located in the mesencephalon (midbrain).

Retrieved 2009-10-01 was a Scottish-born Australian explorer and cattle grazier, and leader of the South Australian Burke Relief Expedition - one of the search parties for the Burke and Wills expedition. McKinlay was also a member of Charles Sturt's Central Exploring Expedition from 1844-1845. The town of McKinlay in north western Queensland is named after him. Early life On 16 August 1819, John McKinlay was born at Sandbank on the River Clyde, in county Argyle and Bute, Scotland. He was the third son of Dugald McKinlay, a merchant, and Catherine n√©e McKellar. John McKinlay was educated at Dalinlongart School and migrated to New South Wales, Australia with his brother Alexander in 1836. The brothers worked with a squatter uncle until 1840 and afterwards took up a property called \\"Yambro\\" on Lake Victoria between the Darling River and the South Australian border. John McKinlay was interested in the Indigenous Australians who inhabited the area, and his knowledge of their ways was of great use later when he became an explorer. In 1844, at the age of 25, John McKinlay was selected to be a part of Charles Sturt's Central Australian Exploring Expedition. McKinlay successfully participated in Sturt's expedition from 1844-1845, which gave him exploration experience of Australia, which at the time was a fairly foreign country to him. South Australian Burke Relief Expedition McKinlay was chosen by the South Australian House of Assembly in August 1861 to lead an expedition to search for the Burke and Wills expedition party, whose fate was unknown. McKinlay left Adelaide on 16 August 1861 with nine other men, 70 sheep, two packhorses and four camels. On 20 October 1861 the grave of a European, supposed to be Charles Gray, was found near Cooper Creek. However, after John King, the sole survivor of the Burke and Wills expedition, had recounted the events it was discovered that Charles Gray died north of Cooper Creek, near what is today known as Coongie Lake. The remains that McKinlay found are still unidentified to this day. McKinlay reported this to the government, and soon afterwards learned that the remains of Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills had also been found. McKinlay decided to explore in the direction of Central Mount Stuart, but was driven back by heavy rains and floods. McKinlay then decided to make for the Gulf of Carpentaria, hoping to find HMVS Victoria which had been sent to meet Burke's party. By 20 May 1862 the shore of the Gulf was thought to be only around five miles (8 km) away, but the intervening country was very difficult, and it was decided to turn east and make for Port Denison on the north Queensland coast. A station on the Bowen River near Port Denison was reached on 2 August 1862, and after resting a few days the expedition reached Port Denison. The party then returned by sea to Adelaide. McKinlay received a grant of ¬£1000 from the government and a gold watch from the Royal Geographical Society of England. Mid-life and Northern Territory exploration On 17 January 1863 McKinlay married Jane Pile ( ? ‚Äì 14 February 1914), a daughter of James Pile (c. 1799 ‚Äì 19 March 1885) an old friend and father of pastoralist and horse trainer John Pile, but was soon off exploring again. In September 1865 he was chosen to lead an party of twelve to explore the Northern Territory and to find a more suitable site for settlement than Escape Cliffs, to which B. T. Finniss had staked his reputation, and was proving a costly embarrassment. It was an exceptionally rainy season and while on the East Alligator River the expedition was surrounded by flood waters. With great resource McKinlay, having killed his horses, constructed a raft with their hides and saplings and with Edmunds and his party made a perilous journey to the coast. McKinlay reported favourably on the country around Port Darwin and Anson Bay as being suitable for settlement. Late life The McKinlay Monument, erected in memory of John McKinlay in 1875, located in Gawler, South Australia. After his return to South Australia from the Northern Territory in 1866, McKinlay took up pastoral pursuits near the town of Gawler, South Australia. John McKinlay died in Gawler on 31 December 1872. McKinlay was buried in the Willaston General Cemetery, with his wife Jane Pile, who died later in 1914. A monument to John McKinlay's memory was erected on the main street of Gawler, Murray Street, in 1875.

The delegation of North Korea was inspected at Frankfurt International Airport by American airline officials during a stop in Germany. American Airlines personnel demanded that the members of the delegation and their belongings be searched. In response to these demands, the North Korean government withdrew its delegation from the Summit. As diplomats, the officials should not have been subject to search. Over 150 world leaders participated in the discussion, including 100 heads of state, 47 heads of government, three crown princes, five Vice presidents, three Deputy Prime Ministers, and 8,000 other delegates. The Group of 77 was also present to discuss the changes the United Nations faced at the turn of the 21st century. The Summit The President of Finland Tarja Halonen and the President of Namibia Sam Nujoma co-chaired the Millennium Summit. This was due to the Presidency over the General Assembly of Theo-Ben Gurirab in the fifty-fourth session and that of Harri Holkeri in the fifty-fifth session. Therefore, the heads of state of Finland and Namibia were chosen to preside over the summit. On Wednesday, 6 September 2000, the Millennium Summit was opened by Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Before moving into the summit, Annan called for a minute's silence for four United Nations workers who were killed in West Timor by pro-Indonesian militiamen. U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a plea for world peace and disarmament. Sixty-three other speakers spoke for five minutes each. In the duration of the summit, Bill Clinton held separate meetings with Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yaser Arafat, calling on them to reach a peace agreement among the two nations, although no actual progress was made in doing so. Both sides were still committed to reaching such an agreement, however. On Thursday, 7 September 2000, various heads of state discussed peacekeeping issues. They discussed these issues at a round-table meeting of the United Nations Security Council. Seventy speakers were scheduled for this day during the summit, including Chinese President Jiang Zemin, South African President Thabo Mbeki, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, and President of Sierra Leone Ahmad Kabbah. The final day of the Millennium Summit, Friday, 8 September 2000, ended after 60 world leaders said their speeches for five minutes each. The speakers included Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. =Middle East peace negotiations= Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called for Yaser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to reach an agreement with him. During the summit, Barak stated: > \\"The opportunity for peace in the Middle East is now at hand and must not be > missed. Jerusalem, the eternal capital of Israel, now calls for a peace of > honour, of courage and of brotherhood. We recognise that Jerusalem is also > sacred to Muslims and Christians around the world and cherished by our > Palestinian neighbours. A true peace will reflect all these bonds.\\" Yaser Arafat responded to Ehud Barak's comments by saying the Palestinians have already contributed to the peace efforts by making significant sacrifices towards a compromise between the two countries. =Peacekeeping forces= Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair urged the overhaul of the United Nations' peacekeeping forces. He called for the creation for a military staff to supervise the operations. American President Bill Clinton also stressed the importance of these peacekeeping missions. =The Millennium Declaration= The Millennium Declaration was adopted during the Millennium Summit by the world leaders who attended, striving to \\"free all men, women, and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty.\\" By the end of the Summit, the Millennium Declaration's eight chapters were drafted, from which the Millennium Development Goals, originally developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), were particularly promoted in the years following the summit. The delegates at this summit agreed on the following eight chapters: # Values and Principles # Peace, Security and Disarmament # Development and Poverty Eradication # Protecting our Common Environment # Human Rights, Democracy and Good Governance # Protecting the Vulnerable # Meeting the Special Needs of Africa # Strengthening the United Nations  Follow-up  Additional summits are to be held every five years after the Millennium Summit to assess the progress of the United Nations in reaching towards the Millennium Development Goals. The first follow-up to the Millennium Summit was held in the year of 2005 at the 2005 World Summit. The United Nations summit for the adoption of the Post-2015 Development Agenda will be held from 25 to 27 September 2015, in New York and convened as a high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly. Proposed 6 themes for Interactive Dialogues are: * Eradicating poverty in all its dimensions and addressing inequality * Tackling climate change and achieving more sustainable lifestyles * Building strong, inclusive and resilient economies * Promoting peaceful societies and strong institutions * A renewed global partnership and adequate means of implementation * Reviewing progress on SDG commitments; universality and differentiations Footnotes See also * United Nations Millennium Campaign * United Nations Millennium Forum * Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict External links * Copy of the Millennium Declaration * Lil' MDGs ‚Äì MDGs for Children 23px ‚áí Development cooperation stories 23px ‚áí Development Cooperation Issues 17px ‚áí The Vrinda Project Documentary: Stories of Millennium Development Goals Category:United Nations conferences Category:2000 in the United States Category:2000 in New York (state) Category:Diplomatic conferences in the United States Category:20th-century diplomatic conferences Category:2000 in international relations Category:Events in New York City Category:2000 conferences Category:Turn of the third millennium Category:September 2000 events in the United States ","title":"Millennium Summit"},{"id":"8044051","title":"Baljuvon District"},{"id":"8044073","text":"Nelson Tift (July 23, 1810 ‚Äì November 21, 1891) was an American jurist, businessman, sailor, and politician who is best known for founding the city of Albany, Georgia. Biography Tift was born in Groton, Connecticut. Early in his life he became a devout Episcopal. He moved with his family to Key West, Florida in the 1820s, where he assisted his father in a mercantile business, and then to Augusta, Georgia in 1830, where he was also in business. During his travels, he opened many side businesses and ventures. He arrived in what would later be called Albany and set up a small trading post. On July 5, 1840, he was elected to the Baker County, Georgia Inferior Court and was re-elected to that post in January 1841. In 1840, he owned 11 slaves. Tift was married and had at least one daughter, Fannie, who was married to Confederate War Captain Thomas N. Nelson; he fought in the war and died at Tupelo, Mississippi in 1864. In 1840, Tift was elected as a colonel of the local unit of the Georgia Militia. In 1841, he was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives and was re-elected to that one-year position in 1847, 1851, and 1852. While a state legislator, he supported the reopening of the international slave trade as a means to extend slave ownership to all white Georgians, and chastised white artisans for opposing the use of slave craftsmen. Although not an advocate of immediate secession, he accepted the final decision and lent his services to the new nation.Georgia Encyclopedia Tift founded, edited and published the Albany Patriot newspaper from 1845 until 1858. In 1850, he owned eight slaves. In 1860, he owned nine slaves in Albany, and an additional 19 slaves spread out over two locations in surrounding Dougherty County. Civil War years and later life During the American Civil War, Tift was a captainCSA Navy Ranks in the Confederate States Navy supply department. He built gunboats for the Confederate navy and supplied the Rebel army with beef and hardtack produced by his factories at Albany and at nearby Palmyra in Lee County. After the war ended, he was elected to the 40th United States Congress as a U.S. Representative with the Democratic Party and served from July 25, 1868, until March 3, 1869. He was not permitted to qualify for re-election in 1868 and unsuccessfully contested the election of his replacement, Richard H. Whiteley. After his congressional service, Tift worked in various businesses. He served as a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention in 1877. He was extremely popular with the people of Albany, and built a large home in the center of the city that still stands today. He died in Albany on November 21, 1891 and was buried in that city's Oakview Cemetery. Tift County, Georgia, was named in his honor, but in March 2013 the Georgia Legislature voted to adopt a resolution written by Edd Dorminey of Tifton, naming Tift County after its founder (and Nelson Tift's nephew), Henry Harding (H.H.) Tift. Because H.H. Tift was living in 1905 when Tift County was founded, the county could not be named after him. Wanting the county to honor the Tifts, the delegates chose Nelson Tift, as he was deceased. Role in Georgia On September 24, 1836 Tift, with a group of men headed by John Rawls, president of the bank of Hawkinsville, entered into an agreement to found a city on the west bank of the Flint River.Glancing Backward Albany Georgia This city would eventually acquire the name of Albany; it was named for Albany, New York as both cities are at the head of navigable rivers. A booster, he promoted education, business, and railroad construction. He opposed Radical Reconstruction in the state and in Congress, and was scornful of the Yankee carpetbaggers who came into Georgia after the war. Fair concludes that Tift became \\"more Southern than many natives.\\" His pro-slavery attitudes before the war and his support for segregation afterward made him compatible with Georgia's white elite.Fair, John D. \\"Nelson Tift: A Connecticut Yankee in King Cotton's Court,\\" Georgia Historical Quarterly (2004) 88#3 pp 338‚Äì374 References Retrieved on 2009-05-01 * Glancing Backward Albany, Georgia 1836‚Äì1986 External links * * Nelson Tift entry at The New Georgia Encyclopedia * Colonel Nelson Tift historical marker * The Bridge House historical marker Category:1810 births Category:People from Groton, Connecticut Category:Members of the Georgia House of Representatives Category:Georgia (U.S. state) state court judges Category:Confederate States Navy captains Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:1891 deaths Category:People from Albany, Georgia Category:American city founders Category:People of Georgia (U.S. state) in the American Civil War Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Democrats Category:Northern-born Confederates Category:Tift County, Georgia Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:People from Hawkinsville, Georgia Category:People from Baker County, Georgia Category:19th-century American journalists Category:American male journalists Category:American slave owners Category:19th-century American male writers Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Nelson Tift"},{"id":"8044077","text":"Christine Paule Pelosi (born May 5, 1966) is an American Democratic Party political strategist from California. Pelosi is the author of Campaign Boot Camp (2007), a guide to successful campaigning. She is a daughter of Nancy Pelosi and Paul Pelosi and sister of Alexandra Pelosi. Biography Pelosi is the daughter of Nancy Pelosi and was born in California. Pelosi is the author of Campaign Boot Camp 2.0 (2012) and Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders' (2007), books used in her leadership trainings for candidates and causes. Since 2005 she has directed the AFSCME PEOPLE Congressional Candidates Boot Camp, which prepares Democrats for campaigns and has helped over 40 challengers get elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Her work in public policy and politics includes service as Executive Director (1998‚Äì99), Platform Chair (1995‚Äì2008), and Women's Caucus Chair (2011‚Äìpresent) of the California Democratic Party; Deputy City Attorney (Construction and Trial Teams) and Assistant District Attorney (Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Unit) for the City of San Francisco; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Special Counsel in the Clinton/Gore Administration (1999‚Äì2001); and, Chief of Staff to U.S. Representative John F. Tierney (2001‚Äì2005). Pelosi has also served as a board member and the Interim Executive Director of the Young Democrats of America (2011). In addition, Pelosi has served as volunteer board member for the National AIDS Memorial Grove and the New Leaders Council. She holds a JD from the University of California Hastings College of the Law and a bachelor's degree from Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service.  Democratic National Committee  Pelosi has been elected six times to the Democratic National Committee, where she cofounded the DNC Veterans and Military Families Council and serves as a vice chair. A member of the DNC Resolutions Committee since 2001, she has co-authored dozens of DNC policy statements embracing civil rights, voting rights, economic justice, women's equality, the Fight for 15, gun violence prevention, and veterans and military families.[citation needed] As a member of the DNC, Pelosi has also been a Superdelegate to the Democratic Party National Conventions. She endorsed Senator Barack Obama on June 3, 2008, when he won the popular delegate vote, and joined Ready for Hillary [Clinton] in April 2014. Pelosi is currently running for an open position of the DNC Executive Committee representing the Western Region. She is promoting her vision to: * Ban corporate donations and ban corporate lobbyists from serving as DNC chair- appointed, at-large members. Instead empower diverse grassroots Democrats so that more voices can be heard; * Organize a DNC 50-state strategy with state- based staff required to perform coalition building with Democrats and nonpartisan groups; * Work to democratize our presidential nominating process by ending superdelegates' capacity to trump the will of the voters and by reforming our calendar, caucuses, and convention to maximize participation; * Expand Party outreach by dedicating DNC staff to Member services, caucuses, councils, and committees; and, * Revive our connection to the American people by establishing a DNC Artists Council to defend the First Amendment and engage communities through the arts.  Superdelegate reform  In 2016, Pelosi joined Anna Galland, the executive director of MoveOn.org Civic Action, in calling for a change in how superdelegates to the Democractic Party Convention view their representational obligations. She also co-authored a resolution at the California Democratic Party Convention that \\"called for a broad overhaul of how the party nominates its presidential candidates, including the elimination of caucuses and most super-delegates\\". This reflects a long- standing position of Pelosi's. In 2008, she promoted the reduction of the total number of superdelegates to have superdelegates vote for the winner of the pledged delegates and to allow absentee ballots at the caucuses.  Electoral College member  In 2016, Pelosi was a presidential elector for the state of California in the United States presidential election. Every presidential election year, the 538 members of the Electoral College meet in their state capitals on December 19 to cast the official vote for president. She helped lead the effort to inform the electors and the public about foreign interference in elections. Her motion of opposition to Russian interference in the United States elections was formally unanimously approved by California's Electoral College.

Since its beginning in 1984, the convention hosted many authors such as Robert J. Sawyer, Larry Niven, and J. Michael Straczynski; it also hosted the judging for the Robyn Herrington Memorial Short Story Competition. Appearances had also been made by Jeremy Bulloch and Dirk Benedict. Con-Version held programming on the Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in the form of panels, both round table and instructional, based on all areas of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. There was a costume contest, masquerade, con-suite, dance, art show and auction, gaming, and vendors room. Con-Version focused on all aspects of the genre, from the written word to art and graphics, and from big screen and television to costuming. In recent years, a musical performed by members of IFWA, the Imaginative Fiction Writers Association, had been a fixture. In 1996, Con-Version was the Canvention‚Äîthe Canadian National Science Fiction Convention, at which the Prix Aurora Awards were presented. In 2002, Con-Version was again also CanVention but also ConSpec. In 2005, Con-Version held a mini-convention, Con-Version 21.5, in conjunction with that year's Westercon, which was also in Calgary. The convention originally started when a group of those that were running Non-Con left the con-com and sought to start their own con \\"version\\". Or so the lore says. It then became the Con-Version Science Fiction and Fantasy Society and was registered as such and continued that way till the later years. It then rebranded the society and became known as the Calgary Science Fiction and Fantasy Society. Later the convention was operated by the non-profit Calgary & Area Fandom Enhancement Society. The convention was originally held on the third weekend of July. This happened from Con-Version One till 16. At Con- Version 17 it moved to the third weekend of August. After previously cancelling their 2011 event, the group cancelled its 2012 convention and all foreseeable future events in September 2011. As with many other fan run conventions, Con-Version was met with the popularity of Fan-Expo comic and entertainment expositions that it could not compete with. Other conventions have had some luck within Calgary such as the When Words Collide Writer's Conference which has been growing over the years. Con-Version Conference Areas *Con-Suite - hospitality suite, where delegates could meet each other, socialize, and get a drink. This was usually a licensed room. *Masquerade/Costume Contest - costumers and cosplayers would dress in costumes throughout the con but this would be the one event where they showed them off and were judged and competed for prizes. *Dance - the costume contest was typically followed by a large dance. *Slave Auction - this only ran in the later years and typically was a fundraising event *IFWA Writer's Workshop (Imaginative Fiction Writers Association)- the weekend prior to the conference there would be a writer's workshop that was held at another location. This also contained a short story writing contest. *Programming panels to discuss SF, science and other activities. *24 hour video room - a room that showed various SF films and movies throughout the weekend of the conference. *Dealers room - a large part of the con was a room where various vendors and dealers of SF goods would have tables to sell their wares. *Art Show - usually adjoining the dealers room.

She has been portrayed by Rachel Ames on a contract basis from 1964 to 2002, and on a recurring basis from 2002 to 2007, making guest appearances in 2009, 2013, and 2015. Casting Rachel Ames originated the role of Audrey in 1964 in what was originally a thirteen-week stint with an option for an additional thirteen weeks. The character's popularity prompted the series to keep the character on canvas. Ames took an extended leave in 1970 when she had to be put on bedrest during her pregnancy. Maura McGiveney played Audrey temporarily while Ames was gone. Ames also crossed over to General Hospital's spinoff series Port Charles as Audrey in 1997. In 2002, Ames was dropped to recurring status, and ultimately retired from the series in October 2007. Ames briefly reprised the role for a couple of episodes in October 2009 and reprised the role once again in April 2013 for the series' 50th anniversary.

In North Queensland, the sub-species occurs at altitudes over 700 m above sea level.http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/species/pubs/66668-conservation- advice.pdf With natural discontinuities and habitat clearings, there are 13 different populations in three distinct places to find this glider in North Queensland. One population resides on Mount Windsor Tableland, another on Mount Carbine Tableland, and the third lives in a linear habitat going from Atherton to Kirrama on the Atherton Tableland. These three populations together are estimated to contain around 6000 individual gliders. With their habitat in danger, the yellow-bellied glider is classified as uncommon to rare and is named vulnerable to the tropics. This species is more widespread in southern Queensland, NSW and Victoria. Appearance and behaviour The yellow-bellied glider is a marsupial about the size of a rabbit. It typically has grey-brown fur on its back and has an off-white to orange or yellow belly. It has large pointed ears and a long tail that can grow to reach 48 cm in length. Its body length is smaller reaching to about 30 cm long and the marsupial weighs a total of 700 g. The males are usually bigger than the females. There are two subspecies: * P. a. australis in the south (which is locally common) * P. a. reginae in northern Queensland (which is rare and threatened with logging) The yellow-bellied glider is the largest species of Petaurus, the wrist-winged gliders, a group of arboreal marsupials, and can glide up to 150 m. The yellow-bellied glider has been observed to jump up to 100 m or 114 m. It is similar in appearance to the mahogany glider, although slightly larger in size. It is also similar in appearance to the greater glider, a species that is more closely related to the lemur-like ringtail possum than to the other members of the genus Petaurus. The yellow-bellied glider is gregarious and spends the day in a leaf-lined tree hole, which is usually shared with other members of the same family. It is also one of the most vocal possum gliders. It has a distinctive growling call that it uses as means of communication.http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/biodiversity/southeast- bcp/pdfs/gliders.pdf It has been recorded to have been heard up to 500m away. A recording of the distinctive call can be heard at Reproduction Breeding occurs in spring in the south, but throughout the year in Queensland in the north. Sexual maturity for the glider is around two years of age when the glider will then pair up with another glider, usually in a monogamous relationship and mate August to December. The offspring are normally born between May and September. They then stay in the marsupium for about 100 days. The young are then left in the den for 2‚Äì3 months before they are weaned from the mother and go off on their own. While in the dens both parents will care for the offspring. In North Queensland the dens are made in Eucalyptus grandis trees and are lined with leaves. Their total life expectancy is about six years. Diet The yellow-bellied glider's diet consists of nectar, honeydew, insects, pollen and a wide spread of tree sap including different Eucalyptus sap, Corymbia sap, some Angophora sap, and Lophostemon sap. It shows a strong preference for trees with a smooth bark, possibly relating to the volume of sap flow. It obtains the tree sap by biting a 'V' shape wedge/notch into the bark to promote the flow of gum and sap. It usually incises the bark on the trunks or upper branches of the trees. Conservation Habitat loss and fragmentation due to timber-harvesting and agriculture are the main threats to this species. The previous felling of old nest trees together with regular proscribed fire regimes and general timber removal have led to a degradation of the remaining habitats. Previously it had been listed as a species of \\"Least Concern\\" because of a wide distribution, including several protected areas. This listing was changed to \\"Near Threatened\\" in the 2016 IUCN Red List publication because of a population decrease of 30% over three generations.

In order to secure the fish on the hook, a sharp motion is performed to push the barb of the hook into the fish's mouth, preferably in the corner. If this motion were not performed, while it is possible for a fish to set itself, the likelihood of successfully landing the fish is minimal since, without the barb of the hook secured, the fish could shake the hook out of its mouth. The motion is usually a sharp, sweeping motion of the rod, either upwards or to the side, depending on the orientation of the rod at the moment the fish bites. Some fishermen will perform several hooksets in quick succession to ensure that the fish is securely hooked, especially on fish with tough mouths such as some saltwater species. It can also be important to act quickly so that the bait is not swallowed. This would cause the hook to set in the gut of the fish and that would tend to kill it which would not be appropriate when catch and release is wanted or required. In contrast, anglers using circle hooks shouldn't set the hook with a vigorous action, since the hook's design allows it to set itself when the angler reels in. Timing is important when setting the hook when fly fishing as fish such as trout will spit out the fly quickly when they find it is not real.

They are currently on Laguana's digital record label, Neglektra.  History  Sharky Laguana and Ian Sefchick both played in the Cincinnati, Ohio, punk band The Rottweilers while in high school. In 1990, Laguana moved out to San Francisco with his four-track and started Creeper Lagoon as a solo project. Sefchick moved to San Francisco some years later, did a brief stint with the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and then reunited with Laguana in Creeper Lagoon. The lineup was rounded out by bassist Geoffrey Chisholm and drummer Patrick Mangan (who was later replaced by David Kostiner). The quartet released its self-titled five-song debut EP in 1997 on Oakland rap label Dogday. Four of those songs were re-worked for the band's 1998 full-length debut, I Become Small and Go, released on the Dust Brothers vanity label, Nickelbag, and featured the production of Dust Brother John King on a few tracks. The band was named Spin Magazine's Best New Artist in 1998. Their success led them to the DreamWorks label for their follow-up, 2001's Take Back the Universe and Give Me Yesterday. After the album and subsequent tour, the band broke up, with Laguana retaining the band name. Creeper Lagoon went on to release an EP in 2002 (Remember the Future) and an album in 2006 (Long Dry Cold). Creeper Lagoon's song \\"Under the Tracks\\" appears on the soundtrack of the 2002 film Orange County. The track has been falsely attributed to Coldplay on many music sites.

It is the third novel about the Austin family, taking place between the events of The Moon by Night (1963) and A Ring of Endless Light (1980). Unlike those two novels and Meet the Austins (1960), it does not center on Vicky Austin specifically, but on a family friend, Josiah \\"Dave\\" Davidson. Plot summary As the story opens, the Austin family has settled in a New York City apartment after the events of The Moon by Night, and made some friends; blind young pianist Emily Gregory and Josiah \\"Dave\\" Davidson, who helps Emily get around. Emily is studying under the tutelage of the passionate, leonine Emmanuel Theotocopulous, better known as Mr. Theo. Canon Tallis, newly arrived at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine after the events of The Arm of the Starfish, meets the Austin children and their friends just as they encounter an anachronistic Genie in a junk shop. Tallis advises and helps to protect the children as they are drawn into a mystery involving the Genie, a street gang called the Alphabats, and the local bishop's strange behavior. Dave is skeptical of the Genie, as is Suzy Austin, but the others are not sure. Centralized, single-minded activity on the part of the criminal Alphabats excites the suspicion of Canon Tallis, who interrogates Dave and Dr. Wallace Austin. Dr. Austin has been working on the creation and perfection of a laser-based Micro-Ray, which is so unerringly precise that it may do more than simply penetrate the corporeal. Dave was once a member of the Alphabats, but has turned from their ways. He is in denial of his past, not even talking about it. Tension builds as the 'Bats try to draw Dave into their new mischief, whose mastermind is none other than the Bishop himself. The Genie appears to be the bishop's servant, and also appears to possess a Micro-Ray. It is revealed that the bishop has given up hope for the world; that he hopes to establish a state of control over humanity, whereby he may prevent anything he deems detrimental to its success. His Genie, Hythloday, uses the Micro-Ray to control the Alphabats. A concentrated beam from it stimulates the brain's pleasure center, giving the victim a feeling of flight. The Alphabats, hoping to receive more of this pleasure as a reward, carry out the bishop's demands. Eventually, Rob Austin is captured. Vicky and Emily track him to the Cathedral, where they are joined by Vicky's family, Canon Tallis, and Mr. Theotocopulous. The united group expose the bishop as an imposter, being the original bishop's brother, actor Henry Grandcourt; break apart his plans to seize power; and unmask Hythloday as the dishonest scientist Dr. Hyde. The Micro-Ray is seized. Dave makes his peace with both his past and future, coming eventually to look upon those who have been with him as his family. Major characters *Josiah \\"Dave\\" Davidson -- A somewhat troubled teenager at the time of The Young Unicorns, Dave is a carpenter's son, a former gang member and choir boy, and the friend and sometime protector of the Austin children. *Emily Gregory -- The only child of widowed Dr. Gregory, Emily was blinded under mysterious circumstances. Although she is learning to adjust, the danger to her is not over. *Vicky Austin -- The protagonist of the other Austin family novels, Vicky is a budding poet and writer, the second eldest of four children. (Her elder brother John is away at college.) Often at odds with her younger sister, Suzy. Vicky has a mentor and kindred spirit in her maternal grandfather, retired minister Grandfather Eaton. At the time of The Young Unicorns, Vicky is fifteen years old, and feeling out of place and isolated in the big city, after a summer in which two boys competed for her attention. Nevertheless, she considers Emily her first real \\"best friend.\\" *Suzy Austin -- Generally considered the beauty of the family, Suzy \\"has wanted to be a doctor ever since she could talk,\\" and prefers science and rational explanations to fantasy and philosophizing. Being the closest to Emily in age, Suzy resents the fact that Vicky is Emily's best friend among the Austins. *Rob Austin -- The youngest of the Austin children, seven-year- old Robert Austin is curious and loving, with a penchant for insightful questions. Madeleine L'Engle has acknowledged that Rob is based on her own youngest child, Bion Franklin. In The Young Unicorns, Rob's trusting nature gets him into trouble. *Canon Tom Tallis -- Episcopal Canon. Tallis, a brusque, incisive man who is surprisingly adept at dealing with dangerous situations, appears in four novels. The character is based on L'Engle's spiritual advisor at St. John the Divine, Canon Edward Nason West.About the Author - Madeleine L'Engle *Emmanuele Theotocopoulos (nickname Mr. Theo) -- Elderly and excitable, Mr. Theo is Emily's piano teacher, an old friend of Canon Tallis, and the cathedral's semi-retired organist. Fiercely protective of Emily and to a lesser extent the Austins, he frequently has temper tantrums which mask his love for the objects of his anger. Locations and sources The primary setting of the book is the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, an Episcopal cathedral in New York City. Madeleine L'Engle was a volunteer librarian and writer-in-residence at this cathedral for several decades. It was early in this period in which she wrote The Young Unicorns. The Austin children and Emily attend school at St. Andrew's School, an Episcopal school that may be based on St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's Anglican School where L'Engle taught in the early 1960s. As L'Engle's own family, the Franklins, did in 1959, the Austins at the time of the novel have recently moved back to New York after years of living in rural Connecticut. Unlike the Franklins, however, who stayed primarily in New York thereafter but also retained their Connecticut farmhouse, the Austins' move to New York is temporary. Reception At the time of the book's publication, Kirkus Reviews said, \\"The Young Unicorns is a kind of aggiornamento of the Austin series and The Arm of the Starfish--via cross-references and a congeries of characters--and Wrinkle...the latter because seven-year-old Rob Austin speaks with the same precocious wisdom as Charles Wallace and, in the clinch, withstands evil with the same indomitable innocence: the roles are interchangeable... Miss L'Engle envelops these melodramatics in church music and theological speculations; she also writes with an insinuating slickness: the insupportable is readable.\\" Series notes The Young Unicorns is unusual among the Austin family series of books in that it is written from a third-person omniscient point of view and does not have Vicky Austin as its central character. Vicky is the first person protagonist and narrator of the first two novels in the series, Meet the Austins and The Moon by Night, and of the book that follows The Young Unicorns, A Ring of Endless Light. The Young Unicorns centers largely on the Austins' new friend Dave Davidson, but also has moments from the point of view of each of the Austins (both children and adults) and of Canon Tallis. It takes place approximately six months after The Moon by Night; A Ring of Endless Light takes place the following summer.

He was made a member of the Calgary Stampeder's Wall of Fame in 1992, and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2006, Burden was voted to the Honour Roll of the CFL's top 50 players of the league's modern era by Canadian sports network TSN.  Early years  Following an outstanding high school football career at Raleigh's William G. Enloe High School, Burden and Charley Young became the first African-Americans recruited to the North Carolina State University football team in 1970. As sophomore in 1971, he led the team with 227 carries for 910 yards (4.0-yard avg.) and 8 rushing touchdowns. He set the school's single-game record with 198 rushing yards against Kent State University. In 1972, when Lou Holtz arrived as the new head coach at North Carolina State University, he implemented split-back veer offense to take advantage of the talent at running back, that included Burden, Young, Stan Fritts and Roland Hooks. At the time, this was arguably the best group of running backs in the nation, they were known as \\"The Four Stallions\\" and everyone of them went on to play in a professional football league.

That office detailed her as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida to assist with the use of classified information in the prosecution of Panamanian military leader Manuel Noriega. In April 2012, she was hired as outside counsel by the Federal Trade Commission to lead an antitrust inquiry into Google. =Justice Department= After completing her four-year obligation to the U.S. Army, Wilkinson became a full-time Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York in 1991, prosecuting various kinds of cases including narcotics, white collar offenses, and violent crimes. Among her cases was the first United States prosecution of a bombing of an airliner‚Äîthe 1994 case against Colombian narcoterrorist Dandeny Mu√±oz Mosquera, whom she successfully prosecuted for the bombing of an Avianca civilian airliner as well as murder of U.S. citizens and other drug-related crimes.

She then became special counsel to the deputy attorney general, advising the top management of the Department on criminal policy and investigations. She was promoted to principal deputy of the Department's Terrorism and Violent Crime Section, and it was in that capacity that she participated in the trial team in U.S. vs. McVeigh and Terry Nichols. She won the Attorney General's Exceptional Service Award an unprecedented second time. =After the Justice Department= After leaving the Justice Department, Wilkinson became a co-chair with Gerald Kogan of the Constitution Project's Death Penalty Committee of the Criminal Justice Program, \\"a bipartisan committee of death penalty supporters and opponents who all agree that the risk of wrongful executions in this country has become too high.\\" She also became a partner in Latham & Watkins, LLP, Washington, D.C., where she co- chaired the White Collar Practice Group and advised clients on internal investigations. =Fannie Mae= In 2006, Fannie Mae recruited Wilkinson as parts of its effort to rebuild its relationship with regulators after accounting scandals and complaints about its corporate culture.

Sullivan before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which was concerned with resolving former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's petition for writ of mandamus in a criminal proceeding against General Flynn. As the trial judge, Sullivan didn't immediately grant a United States Department of Justice request to drop criminal charges against Flynn, subsequent to Flynn's guilty plea, but instead appointed retired United States District Judge John Gleeson as an Amicus curiae, \\"friend of the court,\\" and scheduled an oral argument on government's motion. Before the hearing, the Washington Post described Sullivan's hiring of an attorney as a \\"rare step that adds to this criminal case‚Äôs already unusual path\\". On June 24, the DC Cicuit court panel granted Flynn's petition in a 2-1 ruling, \\"direct[ing] the district court to grant the government‚Äôs Rule 48(a) motion to dismiss ... [and] vacat[ing] the district court‚Äôs order appointing an amicus as moot,\\" with Judge Rao writing for the majority and Judge Wilkins dissenting, and the panel unanimously denied the request that the case be reassigned to another judge.Appeals court orders Flynn case dismissal, after years-long legal saga; In re Michael T. Flynn, No. 20-5143, June 24, 2020 While initially a lost for Wilkinson, the DC Circuit court agreed to re-hear the case again pursuant to an en banc hearing. Ultimately, the DC Circuit on August 31 reversed the panel's decision, denied Flynn's counsel request for a writ of mandamus and denied the request to assign the case to a different judge, allowing Sullivan to rule on the Justice Department motion to drop or uphold the prosecution. A substantial win for Wilkinson, the Judges Karen Henderson, a George W. Bush appointee and Neomi Rao, a Donald Trump appointee dissented in the 8-2 decision. The two judges who ruled in favor of Flynn in June, Rao and Henderson, also reversed their earlier position that the case should not be taken from Sullivan and assigned to another judge in their dissent.Appeals court deals setback to Flynn‚Äôs attempt to end DOJ case, Politico, Josh Gerstein, August 31, 2020.

The Office is currently led by Beth Ann Williams. History The Office of Legal Policy (OLP) was established by Attorney General William French Smith in 1981 as the principal Department office to plan, develop, and coordinate the implementation of major policy initiatives of high priority to the Department and to the Administration, and to assist the President and the Attorney General in the Administration's judicial selection process for Article III judges. OLP devoted considerable efforts to the areas of criminal and civil justice reform, as had some of its predecessor policy offices (among them, the Office of Criminal Justice, the Office of Policy and Planning, and the Office for Improvements in the Administration of Justice). OLP also supervised the work of the Office of Information and Privacy (OIP) with respect to Freedom of Information and Privacy Act matters. In 1989, the office was renamed as the Office of Policy Development (OPD), and OIP was established as a separate Department component. For a one-year period, OPD was organized as a component of the newly created Office of Policy and Communications, together with the Office of Public Affairs and the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. In 1993, that structure was discontinued and OPD was established again as an independent component. In May 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft restored the name of the office as the Office of Legal Policy and confirmed its principal policy role within the Department.

The exterior is all blue glass except for granite accents at the base on the eastern and western facades and granite columns at the main entrance. It is currently the eighth-tallest building in Philadelphia. The building was originally intended to have a twin tower just to its west but the office-space requirements of the company ultimately ended plans for it. That lot remained vacant until an apartment building was built on it around 2015-2016. Alain Robert, the famous \\"French Spider-Man\\", scaled the building to the 44th floor in 1997, two years after the back-lit Blue Cross logo was added to the building's pediment.

The correct hat would be a semi-formal homburg, bowler, or boater hat. Just as morning dress is considered the formal daytime equivalent of formal evening attire dress coat i e. white tie, so the stroller is considered the semi-formal daytime equivalent of the semi-formal evening attire dinner jacket i.e. black tie (also called tuxedo). Unlike other dress codes, there is no clear equivalent for women, though typical morning dress and cocktail dress have both been identified as alternatives. Wearing black lounge suit the traditional way with formal trousers largely fell out of use following the counterculture of the 1960s, although its practice has still been observed occasionally ever since. For a semi-formal wedding day attire, the groom may dress in a dark-grey suit jacket with a dove-grey or buff waistcoat and optionally a wedding tie. For a semi-formal funeral day attire, the mourner may wear a matching black jacket and waistcoat presumably with black necktie. Name In British English it is called black lounge suit. Since black was reserved for formal wear, it was unknown as a colour for lounge suits, so the term was unambiguous. It has also been referred to as Marlborough suit in the U.K. In American English the style is referred to as stroller suit, club coat or sack coat.https:chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1997-01-02-9701020106-story,amp.html Around continental Europe, the style is often called a Stresemann after the German chancellor Gustav Stresemann (1878‚Äì1929) of the Weimar Republic, who wore the style as an alternative to morning coat. In German it is also known as (English: \\"Bonn suit\\") after the capital of post World War II Western Germany. It is also known as director's suit from the term inside director (especially in Japan), or citydress. History Background: Max Alvary (1856‚Äì1898) in black lounge suit before the conventional name of it in 1896. Israeli pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim (born 1942) at the Musikverein in Vienna, Austria (2008). While early prototypes of black lounge suit did occur in the late 19th century, current form was settled on around 1900. Stresemann famously wore the suit during the negotiations of the Locarno Treaties in 1925, and in Germany it became synonymous with him. Winston Churchill is depicted in many photographs and paintings wearing a black lounge suit and striped formal trousers while serving as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom this mode of dress is now unusual, though the dress code sometimes does occur in fraternal orders such as Freemasonry for semi-formal daytime meetings. It is also still worn within the legal profession, especially by barristers. Indeed, the striped formal trouser are in some circles referred to as \\"barrister trousers\\". The stroller's apparent decline in use, as opposed to the staying power of its evening counterpart the dinner jacket, could be attributed to several factors: daytime formality in general, and specifically the standard of changing clothes for various occasions, fell out of general use in post- World War II Western culture; and strollers were sometimes associated with uniformed servants, a concept which had also fallen out of favour. By the late 20th century, fictional characters in media depicted wearing strollers were often portrayed as self-important or inflexible snobs, often in opposition to more sympathetic characters dressed casually. Traditionally, in Continental Europe and the British Commonwealth of Nations, morning dress is worn to formal day events, and white tie for formal evening events. However, when both dress codes declined in use in the United States, this also affected the use of the stroller. Yet, notably, at his first inauguration in 1981, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan wore a black stroller, which generated some controversy among D.C. lawmakers. In media Gentlemen's valets of the early 20th century are often depicted in television and film wearing black lounge suits as their standard apparel. In the 1964 Walt Disney film Mary Poppins (set in the 1910s), the character of Mr. Banks wears a black lounge suit to work every day at the bank. Thunderball (1965) of the James Bond films features a black lounge suit wedding. The Pan Tau children's television series (1969‚Äì1978) features a black lounge suit-wearing protagonist with the same name. In the long-running BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? (1972-1985), the character Captain Peacock always wore a stroller as the store's floorwalker. The character of John Bates of Downton Abbey (2010‚Äì2015) typically appears in a stroller while serving as his lord's valet. In the German neo-noir crime drama Babylon Berlin (2017-), set during the Weimar Republic, German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann wears a Stresemann suit accordingly.

He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman and outfielder for the Chicago White Sox (1963‚Äì70), Washington Senators (1971), Cleveland Indians (1972 and 1974‚Äì75) and California Angels (1973‚Äì74). Biography The native of Malvern, Arkansas, stood tall and weighed during his playing days. He batted and threw left-handed. In 13 big- league seasons he played in 1,468 games and had 3,956 at bats, 484 runs, 972 hits, 150 doubles, 42 triples, 75 home runs, 404 RBI, 143 stolen bases, 332 walks, .246 batting average, .309 on-base percentage, .362 slugging percentage, 1,431 total bases, 42 sacrifice hits, 26 sacrifice flies and 48 intentional walks. On September 30, 1971, McCraw made the last offensive play for the Washington Senators franchise, when he was caught stealing second for the Senators final out of their final game in the bottom of the 8th against the New York Yankees. McCraw was also involved in a bizarre play against his future team, the Indians, at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium on May 17 of that year. Leading off the bottom of the 4th inning, he hit a 140-foot pop-up (some sources say it was 250 feet) for what should have been an out. Instead, shortstop Jack Heidemann, left fielder John Lowenstein and center fielder Vada Pinson collided going for the ball, which fell amongst the trio. All three players were injured and had to be replaced. McCraw circled the bases for what would be scored an inside-the-park home run. McCraw was the first player in Angels history to serve as a designated hitter. He went 1-for-4 in the Angels' 1973 season opener, a 3-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals at Anaheim Stadium.Retrosheet McCraw enjoyed a long career as a batting coach after his active career ended, logging 24 seasons on the Major League staffs of the Cleveland Indians (1975; 1979‚Äì82), San Francisco Giants (1983‚Äì85), Baltimore Orioles (1989‚Äì91), New York Mets (1992‚Äì96), Houston Astros (1997‚Äì2000), and Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals (2002‚Äì05).

Although he has not been charged in Canada,Adelman, Howard. 21st Century Sovereignty: Security, Immigration and Refugees the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) has stated that they believe he will \\"engage in or instigate the subversion by force of the government of Egypt\\" if allowed free. However, CSIS has refused to provide any public evidence to substantiate its claims. Life Following his graduation from the University of Zagazig in Egypt, Mahjoub says he served in the Egyptian military, but faced persecution and torture from the civil police force due to his \\"religious beliefs\\". He stated that he had tried to leave Egypt but was refused by state security; until June 1991 when he applied to leave the country as part of the Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. Following the pilgrimage, he went to the Sudan in August. Mahjoub spent five months looking for work as an agricultural engineer specializing in land reclamation, and believed it was his lack of experience that prevented him from finding a job.Mahjoub, Mohammad.

Bin Laden met with Mahjoub for 90‚Äì120 minutes, and told him that he'd been interviewing other agricultural engineers, but none that specialised in reclamation. He noted Mahjoub's lack of experience, and told him to take a week to study the needs at the Al-Damazin Farms, which included 4,000 seasonal workers tending nearly a million acres (4,000 km¬≤), and then decide whether he felt the job was right. Mahjoub met with Mubarak al-Duri, and agreed to sign on as the project's Deputy General Manager. On October 17, 1993, al-Duri wrote Mahjoub a reference letter vouching for his work with the farms in al-Damazin from February 1992 until May 1993.Transcript of Proceedings, Volume 9, Between Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and Solicitor General of Canada and Mohamed Zeki Mahjoub, March 5, 2001, p. 852, Exhibit 15 Mahjoub says he left the job following an argument about his comparatively low wages compared to other employees in the firm, and that despite his 10-hour shifts. he was often asked to work overtime up to 8 hours a day, and that bin Laden asked some mutual colleagues to offer Mahjoub back his job with a higher salary several times; he has had no contact with any of them since leaving the Sudan in 1995.Affidavit of Mohamed Zeki Mahjoub signed on September 6, 2000, in the Federal Court (Trial Division) between Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and Mohamed Zeki Mahjoub, pp.15-20, paras.39-59.

In 1998, he was introduced to Essam Marzouk at the house of Ahmed Khadr's in-laws in Toronto. Marzouk made a number of phone calls to Mahjoub, although Mahjoub denied knowing him in a 1998 interrogation. He still had Mubarak al-Duri, his old supervisor at the Sudanese farm project, in his address book with two UAE contact phone numbers - with a note scrawled beneath reading August 12, 1998, for which he could not identify the significance; but insisted that he hadn't been in contact with al-Duri since leaving the Sudan.CSIS, Summary of the Security Intelligence Report concerning Mohammad Zeki Mahjoub, February 2008 However, following his arrest, officers found a letter to Mahjoub signed by al-Duri postmarked with that date, speaking about how he'd invested money Mahjoub gave him and requesting any future business ideas, and giving him his postal box address in Dubai and fax, cellular and home telephone numbers; the latter two which were the ones entered in Mahjoub's address book.

In the 1999 case of the Returnees from Albania, an Egyptian military court sentenced Mohammed Mahjoub in absentia to 15 years imprisonment. Mahjoub was closely monitored by security forces from at least December 1998, when CSIS argues he \\"exhibited security consciousness\\" by looking over his shoulder three times while speaking on a payphone. Similarly in May 1999, CSIS argues that Mahjoub acted guilty, looking back several times while boarding a bus at the local shopping mall. In January 2000, he told a colleague that he prefers face-to-face communication because of \\"the Mukhabarat\\". In total, Mahjoub was interviewed by CSIS six times before his arrest, August 8 and October 24, 1997, then on January 13 and January 20, 1998, as part of the immigration screening process, and again about his connections to the Vanguards of Conquest on October 5, 1998, and March 31, 1999. Arrest Mohammad Zeki Mahjoub is represented in a 2004 protest outside the Toronto office of CSIS. On May 17, 2000, Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay signed a security certificate calling for Mahjoub's detention on the basis of a Security Intelligence Report provided to him. On June 12, Elinor Caplan, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, provided the necessary second signature. He was arrested either June 12 or July 7.Scheuer, Michael. \\"Through our enemies' eyes\\", 2003. p. 217 At the time of his arrest, he was carrying a slip of paper with Marzouk's former address, 105 10277 135th St. Box 150 Surrey B.C. V3T 4C, printed on it, and later confessed he had indeed known him. On October 5, the Federal Court of Canada upheld that the certificate was reasonable. While in prison, Mahjoub contracted Hepatitis C. In January 2005, judge Eleanor Dawson stated that there was no evidence suggesting Mahjoub was a danger to Canada simply because he had worked on a farm owned by Bin Laden and had met people such as Khadr. She stated the deportation order against Mahjoub was \\"patently unreasonable\\" since he would face torture or death if returned to Egypt.Behrens, Matthew. Campaign to Stop Secret Trials in Canada.

Between 1841 and 1843, a series of public councils was held at Champoeg, a settlement on the French Prairie of the Willamette River valley in present-day Marion County, Oregon, and at surrounding settlements.Carey, Charles History of Oregon. Chicago: The Pioneer Historical Publishing Co. 1922 The meetings were organized by newly arrived settlers as well as Protestant missionaries from the Methodist Mission and Catholic Jesuit priests from Canada. Since the first decade of the 19th century, a small but growing number of pioneers had settled in the Oregon Country, mostly to pursue business interests in the North American fur trade. Despite its economic value, the region was so vast and remote that it was left unorganized for several decades, with no European-American government in place to set laws and resolve disputes. Prior to the Champoeg Meetings, the closest thing to a government in the Oregon Country was the privately owned Hudson's Bay Company, which effected a loose authority mainly through the efforts of Dr. John McLoughlin at Fort Vancouver in present-day Vancouver, Washington. Uncertainty about settling the estate of prominent settler Ewing Young in 1841 stirred a group of settlers led by missionary Jason Lee to advocate for a settler-run local government in the region. The assemblies at Champoeg addressed issues of probate law and estate administration, how to reward hunters who killed animals preying on livestock, and how to compromise on a system of leadership for the proposed government. The meetings eventually culminated in a vote on May 2, 1843, which concluded in favor of forming what became the Provisional Government of Oregon. Though primarily supported by American pioneers and opposed by French Canadian settlers in anticipation of the region's annexation by the United States, several French Canadians also voted in favor of forming a provisional government. A state park and marker at the site of the May 2 vote commemorate the proceedings, as well as a large mural behind the desk of the Oregon Speaker of the House at the Oregon State Capitol in Salem. Background The Oregon Country was an enormous area of indeterminate boundaries on the Pacific Northwest coast. By 1805, it was claimed simultaneously by the United States as well as by three colonial European powers: Russia, Great Britain and Spain. Interest by these nations was mostly stimulated by the prospect for enormous wealth to be obtained from the area's rich natural resources, especially in the burgeoning fur trade. Several voyages were proposed to map the coast, with Alessandro Malaspina, Robert Gray, and George Vancouver arriving in the early 1790s. The overland treks of Alexander Mackenzie and Lewis and Clark which reached the Pacific coast in 1793 and 1805, respectively, continued to ferment interest by Europe and the United States. In 1818, the United States and Britain signed a treaty that called for the two countries to peaceably co-exist in the region, but not to exclude other claims. Through a series of other treaties the number of countries claiming the Oregon Country was eventually reduced to just two, the United States and Great Britain. As such expeditions expanded Euro-American knowledge of the Pacific Northwest, the possibilities of exploiting the fur trade provoked several companies to attempt to establish a permanent presence there. The first to do so was the Montr√©al-based North West Company, which under David Thompson arrived in what is now Montana and created posts such as the Saleesh House to trade with the Salish and Kootenai tribes.Malone, Michael P. Montana: A History of Two Centuries, Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1991, p.44 The American Pacific Fur Company financed the next commercial push into the region, working primarily with Chinookan peoples at Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River. The War of 1812 ended the American venture and its operations were sold to its competitor, the North West Company, which was itself amalgamated into the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821. From Fort Vancouver, located near the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers, the operations of the Hudson's Bay Company grew and quickly became the primary commercial force in the Oregon Country. Despite the activities of American mountain men and upwards of 12 attempted companies, the commercial hegemony of the British company remained in force until after the formation of the Provisional Government. Britain and the U.S. continued a tense \\"joint occupation\\" as economic activity in the region continued to expand. In the 1830s, missionaries, including Protestants such as Jason Lee, Henry H. Spalding, and Marcus Whitman and Catholics such as Fran√ßois Norbert Blanchet, Modeste Demers and Pierre-Jean De Smet, would also travel overland to the Oregon Country and establish missions among the Native Americans there. As time passed many of the trappers and missionaries settled the land and developed farms and timber and grist mills. Beginning in the 1840s, more and more settlers arrived via the Oregon Trail that the early missionaries and trappers had helped to blaze.Clarke, S.A. Pioneer Days of Oregon History. Cleveland: J.K. Gill Company. 1905 Finally, enough Americans, Canadians and Europeans (mainly English and French) were living in the ungoverned land that a critical mass was reached and the settlers began to develop plans for a government.A History of Oregon, 1792-1849, Chapter XXVII Meetings =Location= Oregon Institute building circa 1844 in present-day Salem The plans called for meetings to be held at the French-Canadian enclave of Champoeg on the banks of the Willamette River. This part of the Willamette Valley was and still is known as the French Prairie, since its early settlers spoke French as their first language. Some of the meetings were also held at the Oregon Institute (the predecessor to Willamette University) further south of Champoeg in present-day Salem and downriver in Oregon City. The name Champoeg has an unknown origin. Some theories are that it was a Native American name for its location along the Willamette River, originally Champooik. Other theories are that it is of French origin, or a French variation on the Native American term. The name was later used for one of the early districts of the Provisional Government of Oregon, part of which later became Marion County, Oregon. =1841= In 1841, the early settlers found themselves in need of a government after the death of pioneer Ewing Young. Young had accumulated much wealth as a successful rancher following the Willamette Cattle Company events of 1837 when he and a group of other settlers herded over 600 head of cattle from California to Oregon.Bancroft, Hubert Howe and Frances Fuller Victor. History of Oregon. San Francisco: History Co. 1890 This made him very wealthy and intertwined him economically with many of the other pioneers in the valley. Young had died without a will or an heir, thus necessitating the judgment of a probate court, because otherwise people were sure that Young's estate would be disposed for the Hudson's Bay Company, the Catholic Jesuit priests from Canada, or the Protestant Methodist Mission from the United States, which had happened in the past.Brown, James H. Brown‚Äôs Political History of Oregon: Provisional Government. Portland: Wiley B. Allen. 1892 The settlers decided to assemble at Champoeg, where they hoped to receive input from other prominent settlers and outline a plan of government for the region. Several meetings occurred over the subsequent months, which were attended by Fran√ßois Norbert Blanchet, William J. Bailey, Mr. Charlevon, David Donpierre, Gustavus Hines, William Johnson, Jason Lee, √âtienne Lucier, Robert Moore, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, Sidney Smith, and David Leslie.Grover, La Fayette. The Oregon Archives. Salem: A. Bush. 1853 The first meeting was held on February 17, 1841, and chaired by Jason Lee, who suggested a set of measures that would establish a civil government. Amongst the measures was one which would have organized a single criminal justice system applicable to all Oregon pioneers not employed by the Hudson's Bay Company. The proposed positions included a governor, an attorney general, justices of the peace, road commissioners, and even two people to serve as overseers of the indigent. This initial proposal was rebuked by Fran√ßois Blanchet, who counter-proposed a looser system with the post of a judge, rather than a governor, as the highest position.Loewenberg, Robert J. \\"Creating a Provisional Government in Oregon: A Revision.\\" The Pacific Northwest Quarterly 68, No. 1 (1977).( pp. 19-21 The second meeting, held the following day, was chaired by David Leslie. To mollify French-Canadian discontent over a potential governorship, Dr. Ira Babcock, a physician from the Methodist Mission, was elected as Supreme Judge, using the laws of New York State as his guide to probate any estates.Benson, Arthur F. History of the Judges of the Oregon Supreme Court, 1841-1946. (accessed July 24, 2014). However, the contemporary historian William H. Gray, in his book A History of Oregon, 1792-1849, explained that there would not have been any copy of the laws of New York available to the settlers and that instead Babcock acted \\"just as he pleased\\". In fact he led not only the judicial branch but also the legislative and executive branches. The only other estate that Babcock administered was that of Cornelius Rogers, previously a laborer of the ABCFM stationsDrury, Clifford.

Judson as justices of the peace. Additionally, a constitutional committee of seven, consisting of three Americans and four French-Canadians and chaired by Blanchet, was established to discuss further measures. During the next meeting, commenced on June 1, 1841, Blanchet reported the constitutional committee had not met and requested a reprieve from his duties. William J. Bailey was appointed as the new chairman, and the committee was advised to consult with Commodore Charles Wilkes of the U.S. government and Dr. John McLoughlin of the Hudson's Bay Company concerning forming a government. The group decided on subsequent meetings to be held on August 1 and on October 5. Meeting with five men, Wilkes judged their motivation based on getting \\"settlers to flock in, there by raising the value of their farms and stock\\"; consequently he advised the group to wait for the United States to project rule over them.Wilkes, Charles, Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition, New York City: G. P. Putnam and Co., 1856, p. 352 McLoughlin was equally unsupportive of the considered organization. These reactions discouraged the constitutional committee from ever meeting, nor were the planned general meetings convened. Despite falling short of the original goals set by Lee, these early meetings still helped to create \\"an organized community\\" in the Willamette Valley.Hussey, p. 138 =1842= In Oregon City at the Oregon Lyceum, pioneers debated the aspects of forming a temporary government with the expectation of eventually being annexed by the United States, or forming an independent country. Those favoring an independent nation were led by Lansford Hastings, then employed by Dr. McLoughlin, while George Abernethy led those opposed to a new country. Ultimately those favoring waiting for the United States to take ownership of the region won out in the debates. Hastings noted that if the United States hadn't \\"extended her jurisdiction\\" within in a few years many \\"were favorable to declaring themselves independent... of all powers of the world.\\"Excerpts from the New Orleans \\"Picayune.\\" The Quarterly of the Oregon Historical Society 2, No. 2 (1901), p. 202 On September 22, 1842, Dr. Elijah White organized and spoke at a meeting at Champoeg.Hussey, pp. 142-144 His purpose was to inform the settlers that he had been commissioned by the United States War Department as a sub-Indian agent. Additionally, he implied that the pioneers could select him as a magistrate for the region. However, White was not popular among the settlers and this led to additional discussions about forming a government. =1843= On February 1, 1843, residents of the Willamette Valley met at the Oregon Institute in present-day Salem, Oregon, to discuss at the so-called \\"First Wolf Meeting\\" the issue of predatory animals attacking livestock. The only fact known from the First Wolf Meeting is that Supreme Judge Babcock was elected chairman and appointed a committee of six in preparation for the \\"Second Wolf Meeting\\", which met on March 6 at the house of French-Canadian Joseph Gervais. The total population of non-indigenous people in the valley was under 500 during this time,Loewenberg, Robert J. Equality on the Oregon frontier: Jason Lee and the Methodist Mission. 1834-43. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1976. but the addition of about 1,000 Americans later in 1843 bolstered the pioneer presence. It was not until the Second Wolf Meeting that a system of bounties for wolves, cougars and bears was created. As one participant, William H. Gray, put it, the purpose of the discussions was to \\"get an object before the people upon which all could unite\\" to ensure settler \\"self-preservation, both for property and person\\". Bounties were to be paid by orders on the accounts of Fort Vancouver, the Island Milling Company or the Methodist Mission. The gathering set in motion the organizing of a provisional government, with the post of governor agreed upon. Notably, indigenous people were to get half the pay of pioneers for bounties. The last organizational meeting was held on May 2, 1843, in Champoeg, where Babcock was elected President again and, aware of the great friction on that issue, he called for a vote on whether to create a provisional government. Voting record There were two votes on May 2, neither of which was recorded at the actual event. The report presented by the committee is known to have included the position of Governor,Hussey, pp. 156-157 which was rejected immediately by French Canadians after being read. The meeting was then divided over adopting \\"the report of the committee and an organization\\". According to the only surviving contemporary record, taken by George LeBreton, a \\"great majority of those present\\" voted to form a government.George W. LeBreton; \\"Public Meeting at Champoeg, 1843\\" Oregon Historical Society catalog number PTD R76I12186; 2 may 1843 The first count of the division appeared by Gray in an article of the Astoria Marine Gazette in 1866 as 52 \\"Americans\\" for and 50 \\"French-Canadian and Hudson's Bay men\\" against considering a government, and was later published in his 1870 book A History of Oregon.Gray, William H. A History of Oregon 1792-1849, drawn from personal observation and authentic information. Portland: Harris & Holman. 1870. Additionally, Gray claimed that the French Canadians were \\"drilled\\" by Vicar General Blanchet to vote no, despite the two tiebreakers in Gray's version being the Catholics √âtienne Lucier and Fran√ßois X. Matthieu. Gray's book has been stated to be rife with \\"acrimonious partisanship and disregard of truth\\"; contemporaries including Blanchet, Jesse Applegate, Robert Newell, Peter Hardeman Burnett, and George Abernethy, among others, criticized portions of it. Newell stated the vote was 55-50, with three additional French Canadians supporting the motion.Robert Newell, (Oregon Register, 1866) quoted in Russel B. Thomas \\"Truth and Fiction about Champoeg.\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly 30, No. 3 (1929), p. 224 He also noted that the \\"First vote taken was that we have no Governor to defeat the wolf bummers.\\" The official record states that after the first vote, the report was voted on \\"article by article\\" without the office of Governor appearing. The list below was created several decades after the vote, and after many of the participants were deceased. No roll of participants is known to exist from the time of the actual meeting, and the only primary source from the time of the meeting states that \\"a great majority\\" passed the motion by acclamation.

The members selected were David Hill, Robert Shortess, Robert Newell, Alanson Beers, Thomas J. Hubbard, William H. Gray, Robert Moore, James A. O'Neil, and William M. Doughty. Other offices elected on May 2 were Albert E. Wilson as Supreme Judge, George W. LeBreton as Court Clerk and Recorder, Joseph L. Meek as Sheriff and William H. Willson as Treasurer. =Organic Laws= District boundaries drawn in 1843, showing modern U.S. state and international borders A gathering was held on July 5 to vote on the work of the legislative committee. The original Organic Laws of Oregon were modeled after the Ordinance of 1787 and Iowa's Organic Law, laying out the framework of a political structure modeled on the United States, with three branches of government. The government was created, as its preamble declared, \\"until such time as the United States of America extend their jurisdiction over us.\\" This document was recognized as the de facto first Oregon constitution. The election for the first Executive Committee was held with Joseph Gale, David Hill, and Alanson Beers elected as the committee members to serve in place of a Governor. The entire territory was then divided into four administrative districts: Yam Hill (also Yamhill), Clackamas (also Klackamas), Tuality (also Twality, and later Washington County), and Champoick (also Champoeg). The districts were generally divided according to watersheds such as the Willamette and Pudding Rivers. The northern border of the jurisdiction was not initially clearly delineated due to the ongoing Oregon boundary dispute and to the fact that there no willing participants in the government north of the Columbia River. Subsequent history Seal of the Provisional Government of Oregon The Provisional Government of Oregon originally hardly functioned due to various limitations upon its power, but after the adoption of the second Organic Code in 1845, its control over the Willamette Valley was solidified. It eventually established taxes, built roads, authorized ferries, passed laws, and even waged war against some Native American tribes in the Cayuse War following the Whitman Massacre. Oregon's pioneers considered this government framework that was installed by the adopted Organic Laws of Oregon to be their first constitution,Friedman, Lawrence M. A History of American Law. 1973 ed. New York City: Simon & Schuster. 1985, p. 116. although in 1844 the legislative committee specifically ruled the organic laws statutory rather than constitutional. online at Google Books Negotiations with the Hudson's Bay Company in 1845 expanded the provisional government's jurisdiction north of the Columbia River, its officers continuing to run the majority of the civil affairs in the newly created Vancouver district. In 1846, the boundary dispute with Great Britain was settled, which reduced the area claimed by the provisional government to that territory south of the 49th degree of latitude. A new territorial government was formed after 1848 when Oregon was organized as an official United States territory. The presidentially appointed governor of the Oregon Territory, Joseph Lane, arrived March 3, 1849, and he officially ended the provisional government by declaring that U.S. laws and government were in effect over the territory. Oregon later entered the Union as the 33rd U.S. state, on February 14, 1859. See also *List of governors of Oregon *William Gilpin *Thomas J.

The character was created in 1978, originally played by David Lewis. John Ingle stepped into the role in 1993, and besides a brief hiatus from 2004 until 2006, he portrayed Edward up until his death on September 16, 2012. Casting David Lewis originated the role of Edward in 1978. In 1987 and 1988, Les Tremayne stepped in temporarily due to Lewis' health. Starting on May 3, 1989, Lewis was forced to step down due to his illness. The character was killed off in a plane crash, but Lewis' voice was still heard whenever Lila spoke to her late husband's ghost. After recovering, Lewis returned as Edward on November 26, 1991. His health declined again and he left as the role was recast with John Ingle on August 17, 1993. Ingle received an award for Outstanding Scene Stealer at the Soap Opera Awards in 1999. Ingle was fired in December 2003, and the show planned to again kill off the character, but a last minute storyline change kept the character and Ingle on in a recurring capacity. However, Ingle opted for a contract role of Mickey Horton on Days of Our Lives, and Jed Allan was brought on to play Edward starting on March 1, 2004. In 2006, Allan was let go when Ingle was released from his Days of Our Lives contract and was re-hired for the Edward Quartermaine role. Allan last appeared on December 30, 2005. Ingle reprised the role on April 18, 2006. Following a decline in health and the death of his wife, rumors began circulating that Ingle's Edward was being written out. In September 2012, soap opera gossip site, Daytime Confidential reported that Ingle could possibly be making his last appearance. Former General Hospital scribe, Michele Val Jean also commented on Ingle's potential departure through Twitter. Ingle died on September 16, 2012. He filmed his final scenes on August 24, and the episode aired on September 11, 2012. Character background Edward was born on September 2, 1918 (according to the date in the family crypt). Edward and his wife Lila are considered to be two of the wealthiest individuals in the fictional town of Port Charles, New York. Edward is the Founder & Chairman, former CEO, and principal shareholder of E.L.Q. Industries. Many of his storylines involve health concerns, such as multiple heart attacks, a bout of amnesia in 1989, a stroke and faked coma, and a time in 2004 when his daughter Tracy had him committed to the Shadybrook Sanitarium, though he later escaped with the assistance of Luke Spencer. Portrayer John Ingle describes, \\"Edward likes to think that he's taught everyone around him how to be ruthless.\\" Storyline =1970s= Edward first showed up in Port Charles in 1978, making occasional visits to Port Charles with his wife Lila before moving in with his son, Alan and daughter- in-law, Monica. Edward quickly established himself as one of the most influential residents of Port Charles, becoming a member of the hospital board and a good friend to Steve Hardy and Lee Baldwin. Edward and Lila liked Monica, but warned her about their daughter, Tracy Quartermaine, who wanted to get the Quartermaine estate for her son, Ned Ashton. Edward was thrilled when Monica gave birth to a son, Alan James Quartermaine Jr., whom he hoped would inherit the Quartermaine estate one day. Edward decided to test daughter Tracy's loyalty after she tried to prove that Alan Jr. was fathered by another man, by pretending to have a heart attack. He created a will that would disinherit Tracy, but before he could sign it, he collapsed on the floor. He pleaded with Tracy to give him his heart medicine; she refused unless he promised not to sign the will. Tracy had failed the test, and Edward banished her. =1980s= Edward teamed up with his niece Alexandria Quartermaine to make money with her friends, Victor and Tony Cassadine, by finding the Ice Princess. The plan quickly got out of hand as the Cassadines planned to use the secret formula hidden in the Ice Princess to take over the world. Luke Spencer thwarted the plan in time and Alexandria wound up dead in the end. Alexandria's will left her ELQ shares to Lila. Edward tried to acquire the shares, but Lila was wise to his game. Edward became involved in Luke Spencer's schemes to make money, with little success. When Holly Sutton arrived in town, Edward immediately schemed to become financially involved in her alleged oil discovery, and charmed her in order to try to get in. When it was revealed that Holly's family, the Durban's, were perpetrating an oil scam, Edward blamed Luke for the whole mess. The Quartermaine's biggest problem arrived in the form of Susan Moore, Alan's ex-mistress and mother of his son, Jason. She and Crane Tolliver, Lila's first husband, had proof that Lila had never officially divorced him; this meant that Lila and Edward weren't legally married, and Alan and Tracy were illegitimate. Susan then blackmailed the Quartermaines with Crane's information. When Susan was killed, the whole Quartermaine clan was a suspect. Edward was concerned that the presence of Celia Quartermaine might cause Edward to lose ELQ because of the scandal. However, the real killer was Crane, who was exposed by Jimmy Lee Holt, Edward's son by Beatrice LeSeur. Lila and Edward were later married legally. Beatrice appeared in Port Charles to blackmail the Quartermaines, but she dropped dead at a charity gala, before she got the chance. Edward was suspected of poisoning her, but it turned out Beatrice had accidentally killed herself. Edward discovered what it was like to be broke when Monica and her new flame Sean Donely, found their way into ELQ's boardroom and took the company away from the Quartermaines. Monica then threw the Quartermaines out of the mansion, and they were forced to live above Kelly's. Lila rescued their family by starting a new business she called \\"Pickle-Lila,\\" which was a success and restored the Quartermaines' fortune and lifestyle. When Edward's cousin, Herbert, was killed, Edward was one of the suspects in Herbert's murder, but was proven innocent. While the Quartermaines remained important figures in Port Charles, things remained pretty calm for Edward at ELQ. Edward helped Alan fake his death during Monica's affair with Sean, but eventually helped reconcile the couple. News of Tracy's return after a decade of banishment threatened Edward's health; he was in bed, allegedly sick with a cold. Their reunion had Edward grabbing his heart medication from his dresser, leaving Tracy to remember her actions as a greedy young woman. Edward disappeared shortly after Tracy's return, and was presumed dead when he went on a fishing trip to the Bermuda Triangle. He rewrote his will, leaving everything to Ned, much to the family's dismay. =1990s= Two years later, Anna Devane found Edward playing beach bum in the Bahamas and dragged him back to civilization. He teamed up with Ned and got ELQ away from Paul Hornsby. In 1993 Edward banished Tracy a second time after she ran down Jenny Eckert. Edward set his grandsons against each other by loaning A.J. money to buy into the Port Charles Hotel, which was Ned's domain. Edward was arrested and tried for the murder of Bradley Ward, whose body had been discovered on the Spencers' front lawn. Just as it seemed certain that Edward was going to be put in prison, Bradley's mother Mary Mae Ward took the stand. She revealed that Bradley was Edward's son from the affair that they had during the war. Edward was then acquitted. Though Edward never knew his son, Bradley, his grandson, Justus Ward, was in Port Charles. Justus and Edward formed a bond when Edward set up a foundation to help businesses on Charles Street. Edward became so anxious to shut down Ned's singing career that he bought Ned's record company, L&B;, right out from under the noses of Ned's wife, Lois, and her business partner, Brenda Barrett. Lois got her company back with the help of Jasper \\"Jax\\" Jacks, and Jax got a spot on the ELQ board, which did not make Edward happy, especially when Jax teamed up with Tracy to take over ELQ. When this plan came to light, Edward banished his daughter a third time. When Edward found out Jason fathered a child, Michael, Edward became obsessed with bringing Michael home. He even tried to kidnap the child. This plan drove Justus away from the family and into the mob with Jason. Growing frustrated, Edward promised A.J. the CEO position at ELQ if he could bring Michael home to the Quartermaines, pitting him against Ned. A.J. couldn't believe his luck when it was revealed that Jason wasn't Michael's father ‚Äì A.J. was. Edward was thrilled as well, but he was forced to eat his words when A.J. was able to bring Michael into the Quartermaine fold by marrying Michael's mother, Carly. A.J. threatened to leave with his new family if Edward didn't fork over the CEO position. So A.J. was appointed as CEO, and Ned left, telling Edward that he would not come in and save the family again. Edward tried to keep a long lost family secret from being found out by Luke Spencer and Felicia Scorpio. Despite Edward and Reginald's efforts, Luke and Felicia discovered what they thought was the truth: Edward had killed Lila's fianc√©, Elliot Thompson, and married her in his place. Edward initially denied it, and then told them they were right. But Lila refused to let her husband take the blame and revealed the truth: she had killed Elliot in self-defense. The crime was covered up by the family. Luke and Felicia agreed to keep the murder a secret. Edward tried to ruin Ned and Chloe Morgan's sham of a marriage. He needed Ned back as CEO of ELQ, so he paired with Chloe's aunt, Gertrude, who also wanted to ruin Chloe's marriage. Edward planned to destroy Ned's record company, and then Gertrude would get her design company. Edward couldn't seem to make his plan work. When Chloe was the victim of a hit and run, Edward dropped his vendetta against the marriage, but not his plans to get Ned back at ELQ. However, Ned had no intention of returning to ELQ and managed to thwart Edward's plans yet again. All of Edward's efforts to keep Carly and Michael failed when Jason produced evidence that A.J. was responsible for burning down Jason and Sonny Corinthos' warehouse earlier that year. Sonny used the evidence to blackmail A.J. out of his parental rights, and igiving Carly a divorce. Edward was furious with A.J., kicked him out of ELQ, vowing to make him pay. =2000s= Edward tried to recruit Jax as CEO, in hopes that Ned would swoop in to save the company. Ned remained true to his promise, though, of not returning. Jax forgot about ELQ, though, to go after a drug company. Jax sold his shares of ELQ, which had come from A.J. and Tracy, to Edward. Edward then took over as CEO. Over the next several months, Edward's granddaughter, Emily was kidnapped, A.J. became an alcoholic again, and Ned announced his engagement to Alexis Davis. When Emily fell for her kidnapper, Zander Smith, Edward tried to keep them apart. Emily was nearly killed in a shootout after Zander's release, and she was sent away to boarding school amid her protests. Lila sided with Emily and against Edward, as did the household staff. Zander found Emily and they returned to Port Charles, but Emily refused to live at the mansion. Desperate to keep Emily and Zander apart, Edward faked his own mugging and blamed Zander. Zander was arrested and Edward promised to drop the charges if Emily stopped seeing Zander. But the truth about the mugging came out and Emily continued to see Zander. In 2001, Skye Chandler arrived, announcing that she was the daughter of Alan and Rae Cummings. Unbeknownst to Alan, Edward sold the baby and had the doctor tell Rae that the child had died. Edward hoped to use Skye to his own ends, not realizing Skye had payback on her mind. She managed to ELQ away from Edward. Edward suffered another heart attack, and grew close to his nurse, Melissa Bedford. He cut his family out of his will and put her in. He later took Melissa out of the will, at Alan's request, and Alan's suspicions about Melissa were later proven correct. Edward was blackmailing Skye so she would give him the CEO spot. But Skye turned the tables and came clean about her secrets. Lila appointed Edward co-CEO of ELQ with Skye; Edward had no choice but to accept Lila's decision. Edward and A.J. conspired to use A.J.'s new bride, Courtney, to get Michael back from Carly and Sonny, Courtney's brother. But A.J. actually fell in love with Courtney, and refused to continue their plans. The newlyweds moved out and Edward froze A.J.'s accounts. Edward also bribed Courtney's mother into not giving any money to the couple. Edward then went to battle against Jax, and used Skye as his pawn. By the time Skye wanted out of her deal with Edward, he blackmailed her to cooperate. Edward had a stroke while arguing with Skye, lapsing into a coma. Uncertain of Edward's chances of a recovery, Lila appointed Ned CEO of ELQ. Ned found out about Skye and Edward's agreement, and Skye was forced to tell Jax. Hurt, Jax broke up with Skye. In a drunken stupor, Skye was afraid that she'd pulled the plug on Edward's life support and went to Jax for help. Jax and Ned staged an argument in Edward's hospital room and tricked him into coming out of his \\"coma,\\" which they knew was a fake. Edward then admitted that he had pulled his own plug to set Skye up. Edward tried to get back ELQ, as well as get ahold of Ned and Alexis' unborn child. Ned refused, and fought Edward. Edward became suspicious that Alexis' child was actually Sonny's, and tried to strike a bargain with Sonny, but Ned had anticipated this move and thwarted Edward. Edward conspired with Faith Rosco to teach Ned a lesson. Faith soon proved to be a loose cannon, and Edward cut ties with her. When Alexis was put on trial for Luis Alcazar's murder, Edward conspired to get custody of her daughter, Kristina. He made sure Ned got full custody of Kristina, but when Ned refused to move into the house, Edward set fire to the gatehouse where Ned was staying, hoping to force them to move into the mansion. The plan nearly backfired, but the Quartermaines got custody of Kristina. Soon after, Kristina was kidnapped by Skye and A.J. because Edward hadn't delivered on his promise to give A.J. the CEO position. Alexis then took the baby, but Kristina was later returned home by Emily and Zander. Edward was later blackmailed into letting Alexis see Kristina. Tracy blew back into town just long enough to reveal that Skye was not a Quartermaine and to leave her son Dillon to live with his grandparents. Edward booted Skye off the board at ELQ, and was not happy to have Dillon left behind for him to take care of. Edward hired an English butler named Dobson, and told him to keep Kristina away from Alexis; Edward didn't realize that Dobson was really Alexis in disguise. The truth finally came out, but his attentions had been turned to Dillon, who was seeing Georgie Jones. Edward tried to forbid Dillon from seeing Georgie, but it didn't work. Dillon had an affair with Lulu Spencer, and she got pregnant. Desperate to get ahold of the unborn child, Edward threatened Lulu with a lawsuit when she decided to have an abortion. Lulu's father, Luke, held off Edward, and Dillon later supported Lulu, telling Edward to back off. The family rallied around Emily when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Certain she was going to die, she shared an impromptu bedside wedding with Zander. Emily recovered, and Edward welcomed Zander to the family. It wasn't long before Emily and Zander split up because she had fallen for Nikolas Cassadine. When she announced her engagement to Nikolas, Edward and the rest of the family were less than thrilled, as the Cassadines were flat broke. But right around that time, A.J. secretly emptied the family's bank accounts and took off, leaving the Quartermaines broke, as well. Edward was thrilled when Emily and Nikolas found a treasure on a sunken ship owned by a Quartermaine ancestor that could restore the family fortune. However, Edward was unwilling to share the fortune with the Cassadines, and made his opinion known to the happy couple. Sam McCall then skipped town with the treasure, and Edward had to find another way to get his fortune back. On the night of the auction for the treasure, the Port Charles Hotel burned down, trapping the Quartermaines inside. Lucky Spencer was in the process of arresting Edward for criminal negligence when he suffered a near fatal heart attack. Another all- time low came for Edward when Lila died in her sleep. After a heart wrenching goodbye, Edward faced life alone. Heather Webber married Edward to get her hands on Lila's fortune. The plan failed when Justus was named Lila's heir, and Heather tried to kill Edward. Luke and Skye caught on to her plan, and set Heather up. She went crazy, and Edward had the marriage annulled, then shipped her off to Shadybrook. Edward lived through losing many family members ‚Äì A.J., Justus, and Alan. Luke was the one who helped him move past losing his family. Edward was eager to provide for Elizabeth Spencer's son, Jake, when he suspected Jason was Jake's father. Edward, Monica, and Alice cornered Lulu, but Lulu told them that Jason was not Jake's father, and Edward was crushed. The Quartermaines suffered another devastating loss when Emily was killed by Diego Alcazar. Skye was the one to tell Edward about Emily, and before breaking down in her arms, he told her the story of how he had always wanted to be like Joseph F. Kennedy Sr., but as Kennedy's life progressed, his life fell apart. Edward feels his life has become like this and he has turned into a kind of poison. He even goes as far as telling Skye to leave town before she dies too. Edward tried to make Monica realize that Jason was not to blame for Emily's death. and get her to make peace with him, but she refused. Edward has lately, like many other veterans, fallen into the background. He developed a minor crush on Claudia Zacchara and disapproves of Lulu dating Johnny Zacchara. When he finds out that Luke and his house staff play cards on Tuesday nights, he is upset because he was not invited. He has softened in his old age. Edward was crushed to hear about Michael's shooting, and Tracy decided to invent some problems at ELQ to take his mind off his grief. Edward had been put on jury duty for Johnny's trial for the murder of Logan Hayes. He openly expresses his disdain for being there. When Carly decided that Michael should live at the Quartermaine Mansion after he recovered from his coma, Edward was happy, but he also tried to get Jason to move back home too, but Jason declined. In September 2009, Edward and his girlfriend Deidre Evans were on a date when he socialized with the mayor's wife, Andrea Floyd. When Andrea realized that Edward could implicate her in the murder of her husband's mistress, Andrea poisoned Edward's drink, resulting in him having a heart attack while driving to the hospital carnival, endangering many lives there. In an ironic twist, one of Edward's victims was Andrea herself. =2010s= In January 2010, Edward invites his great granddaughter Maya Ward to Port Charles to live at the mansion. Edward tried using his pull at the hospital to get Maya special treatment as an intern, but she assured him that she didn't need his help. Lulu tried getting Edward and Tracy to pull strings to have Michael's murder charges dropped, but after trying numerous times, they admitted that with Corinthos as his last name, Michael would be given the full extent of the law. Edward was beyond thrilled when his great-granddaughter Brook Lynn Ashton returned to Port Charles penniless. While Edward offered her a full education at PCU, a room at the Quartermaine Mansion, and unlimited funding, she declined, only to turn up at the mansion looking for a place to stay. Before she even moved into her room, Edward, Tracy, and Monica caught her transferring money from Edward's bank account to hers. While it infuriated Monica and Tracy, it made Edward proud. Edward and Monica were sick of experiencing Tracy's wrath after Luke left her, and pushed the couple back together so Tracy would be nicer to them. Edward also offered Maya and Ethan Lovett a million dollars each if they could stay married for a year. They reluctantly took him up on his offer. While Edward seemed quite content over Brook Lynn's relationship with Nikolas Cassadine, he despised Brenda's engagement to Sonny. He even went as far as refusing to walk her down the aisle. While the wedding went through much to his dismay, Edward seemingly enjoyed the reception as he spent time with his family. Edward was devastated later in the evening when Brenda's limo exploded. He arrived at the scene in his pajamas and had to be calmed down by Michael and his girlfriend Abby Haver. While the woman in the limo turned out to be an alive Sam McCall, the event still took quite a toll on Edward. Luke brought him home to Tracy where he remained quite shaken and even a bit forgetful. After Michael's graduation from high school, Edward pitched the idea of having Michael intern at ELQ. Jason told him that Michael already had a job working for Sonny, but it was up to Michael to make that decision. Not giving up, Edward offers Abby a well paying job at ELQ if she gets Michael to work there alongside her. Edward is delighted when Michael accepts his offer, much to Sonny and Carly's dismay. Edward attends a charity event hosted by Carly at the Metro Court, but has chest pains and nearly collapses in the lobby, Skye brings him up to her room. After saying that he's had too much excitement that night, Sonny bursts in with a gun pointed at Skye and Edward, demanding to know where Jax is. When Olivia tells Edward that Jason's been in a car accident, he and Skye head to the hospital. While Edward is sitting with Jason, Sam comes in and tells him that they're engaged, delighting Edward. A few days before Jason and Sam's wedding, Edward visits Jason and gives him Lila's wedding ring to give to Sam. On Christmas Eve, Edward tells Monica and Tracy that the year Lila died, she was planning on getting him monogrammed cuff links. Tracy sends Alice to the jewelry store to pick up a pair, but the store closes before Alice can get there. When Edward opens a present left for him under the tree, he finds a pair of monogrammed cuff links. When the town's water supply is contaminated, Tracy is seemingly immune to the effects of the pathogen, and decides to undergo tests in order to see if her blood could be used to create an antiserum. Dr. Patrick Drake is able to synthesize a single dose, which Tracy steals to give to Edward. A frail Edward, wise to Tracy's plans, refuses to take the antiserum, and instead requests that she give it to Patrick's daughter Emma Drake. A tearful Patrick gets Emma to drink it, as Edward looks on and smiles. In November 2012, Monica informs Tracy that Edward's health is in decline. A devastated Tracy refuses to allow a recently returned A.J. to see Edward, but permits Michael and Sam to say their goodbyes. Sam introduces Edward to her and Jason's son, Daniel Edward Morgan, named after Edward. Tracy eventually comes around, and allows A.J. to say his goodbyes to Edward, but he dies before he has the opportunity to do so. A.J. was devastated at not being able to apologize for his past misdeeds. Monica discloses that Edward's final word was the name of his beloved Lila. Following his funeral, Edward's will is read, which divides ELQ stock between his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, Monica, and Alice. He donates all of his cash and material belongings to charity, cutting Tracy out. The only thing left to Tracy is a jar of Pickle- Lila relish.

Both creations are extinct. The Burrard, later Burrard-Neale, later Burrard Baronetcy, of Walhampton in the County of Southampton, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 3 April 1769 for Harry Burrard, for many years Member of Parliament for Lymington, with remainder failing heirs male of his own to his brothers. He was the son of Paul Burrard and the grandson of Paul Burrard, who both represented Lymington in Parliament. Burrard outlived all of his four sons and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, Harry, the second Baronet, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel William Burrard. Sir Harry was an admiral in the Royal Navy and also represented Lymington in Parliament. In 1795 he adopted the additional surname of Neale on his marriage to Grace, daughter of Robert Neale, of Shaw House, Wiltshire. He was succeeded by his younger brother George, the third Baronet (who like the subsequent baronets used the surname Burrard only). He was a clergyman and served as Chaplain in Ordinary to Queen Victoria for 38 years. On his death the title passed to his son, George, the fourth Baronet, who sat as Member of Parliament for Lymington. He was childless and was succeeded by his half-brother, Harry, the fifth Baronet. The latter went bankrupt and the Walhampton estate was sold in 1883. He was succeeded by his cousin, Sidney, the seventh Baronet, the son of Colonel Sidney Burrard, younger son of the third Baronet. He was Surveyor General of India between 1911 and 1919. The title became extinct on the death of his son, the eighth Baronet, in 1965. The Burrard Baronetcy, of Lymington in the County of Southampton, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 12 November 1807 for Harry Burrard, a General in the British Army and Member of Parliament for Lymington. He was the nephew of the first Baronet of Walhampton and consequently in remainder to that title (see above for earlier history of the family). His son, the second Baronet, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The title became extinct on his death in 1870.

Dating originally from 1225, it was partially rebuilt twice as a result of fire damage, first after a 1380 war and again after a fireworks accident in 1879. The belfry tower at one corner of the building was completed in 1460, and in the next year was equipped with a carillon built by master craftsmen from Mechelen. The current carillon, the sixth installed since the original, has 52 bells. Inscribed on the tower are the Latin words nec spe, nec metu (\\"not with hope, not with fear\\"). This was the motto of Spain's Philip II, whose domain expanded into the Low Countries in 1555. A small wing of late Gothic style, facing the market square and adorned with five life-size statues, was added in the 16th century. From this annex one can access the cellars, which originally served as torture chambers. The schepenhuis with its belfry is one of an ensemble of related buildings that together have received UNESCO World Heritage status (see Belfries of Belgium and France).

refers to two different thread profiles. One is a type of leadscrew and the other is a type of hydraulic sealing thread form. The leadscrew type is often used in machinery and the sealing type is often used in oil fields. The asymmetric thread form allows the thread to have low friction and withstand greater loads than other forms in one direction, but at the cost of higher friction and inferior load bearing in the opposite direction. Buttress thread in machinery In machinery, the buttress thread form is designed to handle extremely high axial thrust in one direction. The load-bearing thread face is perpendicular to the screw axis.Barnwell, p. 163. or at a slight slant (usually no greater than 7¬∞) The other face is slanted, often at 45¬∞. The resulting thread form has the same low friction properties as a square thread form but at about twice the shear strength due to the long thread base. This thread form also is easy to machine on a thread milling machine, unlike the difficult-to-machine square thread form. It can also compensate for nut wear using a split nut, much like the Acme thread form.Bhandari, p. 204. Buttress threads have often been used in the construction of artillery, particularly with the screw-type breechblock. They are also often used in vises, because great force is only required in one direction. It is obvious on inspection that a buttress thread with perpendicular face, operating in a split nut, generates minimal disengagement force when tightened in the normally loaded direction, and thus it is possible to derive quick release devices to, for example, allow rapid repositioning of the movable jaw of a vise without having to rotate the screw by many turns. A screw profile, such as acme, where the thrust face is not perpendicular to the axis, generates a significant disengagement force on a split nut, therefore a more robust controlling mechanism would be required. Quick release vices are readily available. It is not known whether any of them are currently using buttress screws. An expired patent for a clamp using a buttress thread exists and this article describes a vise whose screw thread is disengaged by reverse rotation, which is likely to use a buttress thread, however no currently manufactured devices of that nature have been found at this time (October 2018).

The thread form is similar to that of Acme thread Figure 6.Oil field glossary entry for buttress thread but there are two distinct threaded portions of differing diameters and profiles, the larger having a wedging profile, with a tapered sealing portion in between the larger and smaller diameters. High torque may be transmitted and longitudinal force is transmitted almost parallel to the axis. The thread is about the same strength as standard v threads.

Demographics Most rural counties are experiencing persistent population decline. Compared with households in urban areas, rural households had lower median household income ($52,386 compared with $54,296), lower median home values ($151,300 compared with $190,900), and lower monthly housing costs for households paying a mortgage ($1,271 compared with $1,561). A higher percentage owned their housing units ‚Äúfree and clear,‚Äù with no mortgage or loan (44.0 percent compared with 32.3 percent). States with the highest median household incomes in rural areas were Connecticut ($93,382) and New Jersey ($92,972) (not statistically different from each other). The state with the lowest rural median household income was Mississippi ($40,200). Among rural areas, poverty rates varied from a low in Connecticut (4.6 percent) to a high in New Mexico (21.9 percent). About 13.4 million children under the age of 18 live in rural areas of the nation. Children in rural areas had lower rates of poverty than those in urban areas (18.9 percent compared with 22.3 percent), but more of them were uninsured (7.3 percent compared with 6.3 percent). A higher percentage of \\"own children\\" in rural areas lived in married-couple households (76.3 percent compared with 67.4 percent). (\\"Own children\\" includes never-married biological, step and adopted children of the couple). As of 2016, about 7 percent of homeless people in the United States live in rural areas, although some believe that this is an underestimate.Miles Bryan, In Rural America, Homeless Population May Be Bigger Than You Think, NPR All Things Considered (February 18, 2016). History Rural America was the center of the Populist movement of the United States in the 1890s. Since the 1930s, rural United States has largely been a stronghold for the Republican Party. The notable exception is Vermont, given its numerous Democrats elected to office in the 21st century. Health There are significant health disparities between urban and rural areas of the United States. The per capita rate of primary care physicians is lower in rural areas of the country (65 primary care physicians per 100,000 rural Americans, compared to 105 primary care physicians for urban and suburban Americans).Molly O'Toole, Healthcare access lagging in rural U.S.: report, Reuters (July 27, 2011). Rural Americans are also more likely than other Americans to suffer from chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. A study published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics in 2015 analyzed data on U.S. youth suicide rates from 1996 to 2010. It found that the rates of suicides for rural Americans age 10 to 24 was almost double the rate among their urban counterparts. This was attributed to social isolation, greater availability of guns, and difficulty accessing healthcare.Julie Beck, The Growing Risk of Suicide in Rural America, The Atlantic (March 10, 2015). Notwithstanding the economic and health challenges, a 2018 survey of rural adults found a majority felt they were better off financially than their parents at the same age. They thought their children would also experience such improvement. Forty percent said their lives came out better than they expected. Definitions Grants Chapel, Bonnerdale, ArkansasTwo major official definitions are produced by the Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Census Bureau definition is given by census tract, and policy experts note that it classifies many suburban areas as rural. The OMB definition is by county and classifies some rural areas into metropolitan counties. The USDA has four different systems for defining rural areas: Frontier and Remote (FAR) Area Codes, which define rural areas in four levels of increasing remoteness by ZIP Code, Rural‚ÄìUrban Commuting Areas (RUCA), Urban Influence Codes (UICs), and Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC). The United States Department of Health and Human Services has two agencies that define rural areas. The Health Resources and Services Administration addresses the shortcomings of the Census Bureau, OMB, and RUCA definitions to produce a definition that is balanced between them. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services uses its own definition for setting Medicare payment rates. CityLab defines rural areas by congressional district, based on census tracts and a machine-learning algorithm.

District 2 thumb Seeking an eighth term in Congress, incumbent Republican Congressman Terry Everett trumped the Democratic nominee, Chuck James, in this very conservative district based in the suburbs of Montgomery and southeastern Alabama with almost seventy percent of the vote, securing what would be Everett's last term in Congress before retiring. District 3 thumb This district, stretching from north to south on the eastern edge of Alabama, is Republican-leaning, but not so much as the other Republican-controlled districts. In that spirit, incumbent Republican Congressman Mike D. Rogers, seeking a third term in Congress, was re-elected over Democratic opponent Greg Pierce and independent challenger Mark Layfield, albeit by the thinnest margin of any member of the Alabama congressional delegation. District 4 thumb In this north Alabama district, the fifth-most conservative in the United States, incumbent Republican Congressman Robert Aderholt won a sixth term in Congress over Democratic nominee Barbara Bobo, defeating her with over seventy percent of the vote. District 5 thumb This district, found on the northernmost edge of Alabama, had not elected a Republican to Congress since Reconstruction, despite its strong proclivity towards Republican candidates at the national level and the socially conservative views of its residents. Long- time incumbent Democratic Congressman Bud Cramer had an especially easy time seeking a ninth term in Congress with no opponents. District 6 thumb This district, considered by the Cook Partisan Voting Index to be the most conservative congressional district in the country, owes its strong allegiance to Republicans to tapping the highly conservative residents of the Birmingham suburbs. To that effect, incumbent Republican Congressman Spencer Bachus won an eighth term in Congress with no opponents. District 7 thumb Incumbent Democratic Congressman Artur Davis sought a third term in this very liberal district that is mainly rooted in western Alabama but reaches into some portions of Birmingham. This is the most liberal and only majority black district in Alabama, and as such, Davis won his third term with no opponents.

Early life Edwards was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and graduated from Classen High School in Oklahoma City. He married Elaine June Sheets. He played college football at the University of Oklahoma and the University of Louisiana at Monroe. Professional career He began his professional career in the WFL in 1974 with the Birmingham Americans. He rushed for 575 yards on 99 carries and scored 7 TDs, while also catching 11 passes and returning kickoffs. In 1975, he moved to the Shreveport Steamers, where he rushed for only 163 yards on 49 carries and scoring 3 TDs. In the short existence of the WFL Edwards was the 20th all-time leading rusher. He starred with the Tiger-Cats from 1976 to 1978. He was an all star each season and won the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award in 1977 when he led the league in rushing with 1581 yards.

He was also an early college football player and coach, playing at the University of California, Berkeley and then serving single seasons as head football coach at Nevada State University‚Äînow known as the University of Nevada, Reno‚Äîand at California. Record at Nevada With Hopper leading the Sagebrushers through the season of 1900, Nevada State posted a third consecutive winning season, the last consecutive streak until Ray Courtright's posted four consecutive, from 1919 to 1922. Nevada State went 4‚Äì2‚Äì1 under his tutelage, including their first ever win over a major \\"first team.\\" Prior to this season, the Sagebrusher's primary opponents were small preparatory schools and the second teams of larger California universities. Those few times the 'Brushers faced a major, first team normally lead to crushing defeat. Hopper changed the tide forever by beating the Stanford \\"First Eleven\\", 6‚Äì0. Later work After coaching at California in 1904, Hopper went briefly to the Philippines for his career as an author for McClure's magazine. He was also a friend of novelist Jack London. Personal life Hopper was born in Paris, France to John Joseph Hopper, a native of Ireland, and his wife, Victoire Blanche Lefebvre. He attended schooling in Paris and later immigrated to the United States with his mother to California, where he completed his preliminary education. He married Mattie E. Leonard on September 21, 1901.http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d;=SFC19010922.2.149 He became a United States citizen in 1917. He is also a survivor of the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. After his graduation from the University of California in 1898 James Hopper completed law school at the Hastings Law School. He passed the state bar examination but never practiced law. Instead worked as a reporter on the San Francisco Chronicle, was on the staff of The Wave, a literary weekly and taught school for two years in the Philippines. About 1907 he and his wife moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California where his good friend, George Sterling, had established \\"Bohemia-by-the Sea\\". There he rented a house by the beach where he published stories that he hoped to sell to magazines. In Carmel many of his close associates were friends from his encounters at Coppa's ‚Äúbohemian‚Äù restaurant in San Francisco, including: Harry Leon Wilson, Xavier Martinez, Arnold Genthe, Francis McComas (painter) and his wife Gene as well as Perry Newberry, Mary Hunter Austin, and Sinclair Lewis. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website. When he left Carmel he returned to Oakland to write stories of his Philippine adventures for Sunset and other magazines.Carmel by-the-Sea by Syndney Temple Head coaching record References External links  * Category:1876 births Category:1956 deaths Category:19th-century players of American football Category:California Golden Bears football coaches Category:California Golden Bears football players Category:French emigrants to the United States Category:French people of Irish descent Category:French players of American football Category:Nevada Wolf Pack football coaches Category:Sportspeople from Paris ","title":"James Hopper (writer)"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(B,[["render",H]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/32.md","filePath":"drive/32.md"}'),D={name:"drive/32.md"},L=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{E as __pageData,L as default};
