In his 1964 autobiography, McCollum attributes his success in nutrition research to two people: Davis and Stephen Babcock. He also says that Davis was physically handicapped by severe burns that she received at age ten while playing at a bonfire when her clothing caught fire. She earned a bachelor of science degree in home economics in 1910 at the University of California, Berkeley. She then returned to the University of Wisconsin where she started but did not complete a master's degree. She moved to New Jersey, to work for the Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, later returning to the University of Wisconsin to teach and do research for a number of years. In 1913, Davis and McCollum identified what they termed fat-soluble A and water-soluble B, renamed later vitamins A and B, after long research on rats. Davis founded the nutrition laboratory at the University of Wisconsin. She later helped Rutgers University in New Jersey form a nutrition lab as part of its School of Pharmacy. She pursued history and gardening after her retirement in 1940. Davis died in Racine three days after her eightieth birthday on September 19, 1967.

Iran, Sasanian period, 5th or 6th century AD, stucco originally with polychrome painting. Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik is a book on the history of ornament by the Austrian art historian Alois Riegl. It was published in Berlin in 1893. The English translation renders the title as Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament, although this has been criticized by some. It has been called \\"the one great book ever written about the history of ornament.\\"E.H. Gombrich, The sense of order (London, 1984), 182. Riegl wrote the Stilfragen while employed as director of the textile department at what was then the √ñsterreichisches Museum f√ºr Kunst und Industrie (today the Museum f√ºr angewandte Kunst) in Vienna. His primary intention was to argue that it was possible to write a continuous history of ornament. This position is argued in explicit opposition to that of the \\"technical-materialist\\" school, according to which \\"all art forms were always the direct products of materials and techniques\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, p. 4. and that ornamental \\"motifs originated spontaneously throughout the world at a number of different locations.\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, pp. 17-18. Riegl associates this view with the followers of Gottfried Semper, who had advanced a related argument in his Der Stil in den technischen K√ºnsten; oder praktischer √Ñsthetik (Style in the technical arts; or practical aesthetics, 1878-79). However, Riegl consistently disassociates Semper's followers from Semper himself, writing that As the technical- materialist position had attained the status of dogma, Riegl stated that \\"the most pressing problem that confronts historians of the decorative arts today is to reintegrate the historical thread that has been severed into a thousand pieces.\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, p. 12 Accordingly, he argued for a continuous development of ornament from ancient Egyptian through Greek and Roman and up to early Islamic and, eventually, Ottoman art. Contents arabesques of tendrils, palmettes and half-palmettes in the Umayyad Mosque, Damascus 'Abraham of K√ºtahya ewer', probably made in K√ºtahya, dated 1510. Ottoman ƒ∞znik pottery The Stilfragen is divided into an introduction, which sets out the purpose of the work, and four chapters, each on a theme in the history of artistic style. The first chapter, \\"The Geometric Style,\\" argues that geometric ornament originated, not from such technical processes as wickerwork and weaving, but rather from an \\"immanent artistic drive, alert and restless for action, that human beings possessed long before they invented woven protective coverings for their bodies.\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, 30. He supported this position through an analysis of geometric ornament in Stone Age European art, in particular objects that had recently been discovered in the Dordogne. This ornament, he argued, developed from attempts to represent natural forms in two dimensions, which gave rise to the idea of an outline. After this \\"invention of line,\\" the cave-dwellers proceeded to arrange lines \\"according to the principles of rhythm and symmetry.\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, 33. The second chapter, \\"The Heraldic Style,\\" addresses compositions of \\"paired animals arranged symmetrically to either side of an intervening central element.\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, 42. This type of decoration had been associated by previous scholars, most notably Ernst Curtius, with the technical demands of silk-weaving. Riegl argued instead that heraldic ornament arose before the invention of mechanical weaving-looms, and stemmed from a desire for symmetry. The third chapter, \\"The Introduction of Vegetal Ornament and the Development of the Ornamental Tendril,\\" traces an unbroken evolution of vegetal ornament from ancient Egyptian through to late Roman art. Here Riegl argues that motifs such as the lotus flower, although they may originally have been endowed by the Egyptians with symbolic significance, were adopted by other cultures that \\"no longer understood their hieratic meaning,\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, 50. and thereby became purely decorative. In the most famous section of this chapter, Riegl argued that acanthus ornament was not derived from the acanthus plant, as had been believed since the time of Vitruvius, but was rather a sculptural adaptation of the palmette motif. It was therefore \\"a product of pure artistic invention,\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, 200. and not of \\"a simple compulsion to make direct copies of living organisms.\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, 206. The fourth chapter, \\"The Arabesque,\\" continues the development of the previous chapter through late antique and early Byzantine and into Islamic art. The arabesque is understood here as a geometricized version of earlier systems of tendril ornament, thereby establishing a \\"genetic relationship between the ornamental Islamic tendril and its direct predecessor, the tendril ornament of antiquity.\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, 229. The final two chapters are therefore presented as a continuous history of vegetal ornament from ancient Egypt through to Ottoman Turkey, in which individual motifs develop according to purely artistic criteria, and not through the intervention of technical or mimetic concerns. In the introduction it is suggested that this development could be continued to Riegl's own time, and that \\"ornament experiences the same continuous, coherent development that prevails in the art of all periods.\\"Problems of style, tr. Kain, 9. Significance The Stilfragen remains a fundamental work in the history of ornament, and has heavily influenced the work of Paul Jacobsthal and Ernst Gombrich, among others who have addressed the same themes.Rawson, Jessica, Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon, pp. 24-25, 1984, British Museum Publications, . Rawson's Appendix, pp. 199-222, summarizes the early history of flower ornament around the Mediterranean: \\"Details of the present description differ from Riegl's analysis; however the general outline proposed follows his fascinating account\\" (p. 199) Within Riegl's work as a whole, the Stilfragen constitutes his earliest general statement of principles, although his \\"theoretical thinking had not by any means reached maturity.\\"Henri Zerner, \\"Preface,\\" Problems of style, xxii. By severing stylistic development from external influences, such as technical procedures or a desire to imitate nature, Riegl raised an extremely complicated set of questions regarding the actual source and significance of stylistic change. As Otto P√§cht has written: Thus the concerns of the Stilfragen led directly into those of Riegl's next major study, the Sp√§tr√∂mische Kunstindustrie (Late Roman art industry, 1901), in which he approached style change in late antiquity not as a symptom of decline, but as the result of positive artistic concerns.

The film's plot is centered on a street racing circle funded by a group of multimillionaires who wager millions of dollars over their high-powered supercars. It was written and produced by Daniel Sadek, who also used his own automobile collection in the film. The film title was borrowed from the original working title of the 2001 movie, The Fast and the Furious. A critical and financial failure at the box office, the film is most notable for being funded by subprime loans issued by Sadek's company, Quick Loan Funding, which closed its doors in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis. It was featured on the CNBC special House of Cards as an example of the excess of the pre- meltdown mortgage market in the United States. Redline was released in North America on April 13, 2007. Plot Natasha Martin is a beautiful auto mechanic and aspiring musician who is invited to join music producer Infamous aboard his private jet en route to Las Vegas in appreciation of her services on his Ford GT. She is also a highly skilled race car driver, but is sometimes haunted by memories of her father's death at a NASCAR race many years ago. Meanwhile, on another side of town, Carlo has just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq. He meets up with his brother Jason before heading to Vegas themselves. Carlo is not happy that Jason is living with their mob boss uncle Michael D'Orazio, whom he always sees as the cause of their family's destruction. They are unaware that Michael has been running an unsuccessful counterfeiting ring and owes millions of dollars to another syndicate led by the \\"Godfather\\". On the outskirts of Vegas, a high-stakes race event is being held, with Michael, Infamous, Hollywood producer Jerry Brecken and Chinese businessman Marcus Cheng placing their bets over who has the better car. When Infamous' driver fakes an ankle injury, Natasha becomes Infamous' driver in exchange for $300,000 and a recording contract. However, she is unaware that Infamous has to place her on his wager, as Michael - who has been obsessed with her since watching her band perform on stage earlier - has placed four platinum bars at stake. At the same time, Brecken wagers his brand-new Enzo Ferrari on Natasha. Natasha (driving a Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren) takes on Jason (driving a Lamborghini Diablo). As they approach the finish line, Natasha is several car lengths ahead of Jason, but he quickly zips past her by engaging the onboard nitrous system. Unfortunately, because of the excessive speed, the Diablo loses downforce, flies off the ground and flips in mid-air before crashing upside down at the finish line. Attempting to avoid the falling Diablo, Natasha crashes on a barrier and is knocked unconscious. Before Carlo can reach Jason to rescue him, the Diablo bursts into flames, killing his brother instantly. Michael's henchmen, dressed as paramedics, place Natasha in an ambulance and speed off. Natasha wakes up in Michael's mansion, realizing that she is now his property. Meanwhile, Carlo meets up with an old military friend and picks up some ammunition and gear before riding a Ducati 999 with the intent to kill Michael. After breaking into Michael's mansion, Carlo and Natasha bump into each other and leave the complex. This prompts Michael to have his henchmen kidnap her mother and convince her to drive for him at the next race at Red Rock Canyon in Nevada. Meanwhile, after receiving an ultimatum by the Godfather to pay him $80 million following a botched attempt at giving him counterfeit bills, Michael raises his funds for the upcoming race by borrowing money from the banks using his mansion as collateral. In the final race, Michael, Brecken, Infamous and Cheng place their bets for a combined purse of $100 million. Infamous and Cheng are eliminated from the race after their cars (an SLR and a Porsche Carrera GT, respectively) are involved in separate crashes. During the race, Natasha (driving Michael's Enzo) receives a phone call from Carlo notifying her that he has rescued her mother. While she is several car lengths ahead of Brecken's Saleen S7 Twin Turbo, she stops the Enzo an inch away from the finish line and gives the S7 the win, costing Michael the race. With no money left, Michael is given a last ride from the Godfather's henchmen. As a way of thanking Natasha for handing his driver the victory, Brecken gives her a recording contract (which shortly gives her a gold record and lands her on the cover of Variety), an Enzo and a Koenigsegg CCX. The film ends with Natasha (in the Koenigsegg) and Carlo (in the Enzo) racing each other before being chased by the police on the freeway. Cast Daniel Sadek, the film's producer, makes a cameo appearance as a poker player, alongside professional players Gus Hansen and David Williams. Background Daniel Sadek, a third- grade dropout from Lebanon, migrated to the United States, where he worked at gas stations and car dealerships. After seeing many mortgage brokers buy cars from the Mercedes-Benz dealership he worked at, Sadek entered the real estate business and set up the subprime lending firm Quick Loan Funding in 2002. By 2007, Quick Loan Funding had approved US$4 billion in subprime mortgages, with Sadek's take-home earnings reaching US$5 million a month. He used his earnings to buy several homes in Southern California and Las Vegas, build his collection of expensive supercars and feed his insatiable appetite for gambling. During this time, Sadek was engaged to soap opera actress Nadia Bjorlin. Using his subprime lending firm as his source of funding, he produced the film Redline to show off his car collection and help Bjorlin break out of the soap opera scene. Enzo crash incident In March 2007, Eddie Griffin participated in a charity race at Irwindale Speedway to promote the film, using an Enzo owned by Sadek. During a practice run, Griffin lost control of the Enzo and crashed into a concrete barrier. He walked away unharmed, but the US$1.5 million supercar was badly damaged. Griffin went on to lash at reporters who claimed the crash was a publicity stunt. Box office and reception Redline was both a box office bomb and a critical failure. The film opened at #11 at the U.S. box office, grossing US$3.9 million in 1,607 theaters in its opening weekend. The budget of the film was US$26 million and after six weeks in theaters, the film grossed US$6.8 million in North America. Furthermore, Cartoon Network sued Sadek for failing to pay the US$845,000 advertising fee. The film was not screened for critics before it opened, and reviews after its premiere were universally unfavorable. , the film holds a 0% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews with an average rating of 2.04/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Redline has plenty of bad acting, laughable dialogue, and luxury cars.\\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 24 out of 100, based on 12 reviews. Jalopnik ranked the film number one on their list of The 12 Worst Car Movies of All Time. Home media Redline was released on DVD by The Weinstein Company on August 21, 2007.CDUniverse - Redline DVD Christopher Monfette of IGN gave the DVD an overall rating of 5 out of 10, citing that it gives \\"more of the same; none of the new.\\" The film has also been released on Blu-ray outside the U.S. Legacy In the CNBC special House of Cards, the crashing of two US$500,000 cars for a single scene is cited as a direct example of the excess of the pre- crash subprime loan market in the mid-2000s. Quick Loan Funding had long since crumbled following the film's release, and the expected profits from the film were heavily borrowed against. The film's failure further worsened the situation. Following the demise of his company, Sadek lost his escrow and lending licenses over issues of him withdrawing millions from his corporate accounts to gamble in Vegas. Aside from over a dozen cases revolving Quick Loan Funding, he was sued by Bellagio and Wells Fargo over unpaid debts and repeated cash advances done at gambling resorts worldwide. He declared bankruptcy in 2009. Vanity Fair listed Sadek at number 86 in their \\"100 to Blame\\" for the economic crisis, dubbing him \\"Predator Zero in the subprime- mortgage game.\\"  References  External links  Category:2007 films Category:2000s action films Category:American films Category:American action films Category:American chase films Category:American films about revenge Category:American road movies Category:American auto racing films Category:English-language films Category:Films about automobiles Category:Films scored by Klaus Badelt Category:Films set in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Films shot in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Films shot in Los Angeles ","title":"Redline (2007 film)"},{"id":"9856441","text":"The German Feldpost number (FPN) (German: Feldpostnummer) was a sort of postcode used for items sent by either military mail or airmail.

Six digit codes were used prior to the beginning of the war as exercise post numbers (German: √úbungspostnummern), and during it as collective post numbers (German: Sammel-Feldpostnummern) for places with a higher concentration of troops, such as 123 321 for Festung Posen. Letters following the digits indicated under which command the recipient was, for instance operation headquarters or companies, while letters preceding the numbers stood for the following: * L for units of the Luftwaffe * M for units of the navy (German: Kriegsmarine) * SCH for units involved in the coastal protection The letter A generally signified headquarters company, the others stood for line companies. The sequence of a Feldpost number did not necessarily mean that the location of the units were at the same area.

Modern scholars identify them with the Malloi who were settled in the Punjab region at the time of Alexander's invasion in the 4th century BCE. Later, the Malavas migrated southwards to present-day Rajasthan, and ultimately to Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Their power gradually declined as a result of defeats against the Western Satraps (2nd century CE), the Gupta emperor Samudragupta (4th century), and the Chalukya emperor Pulakeshin II (7th century). The Malwa region in central India is named after them. The Malava era, which later came to be known as Vikram Samvat, was probably first used by them.  Before Common Era  The Malavas are mentioned in several ancient Indian texts, including the Mahabharata and Mahabhashya. According to the Mahabharata, the hundred sons of the Madra king Ashvapati, the father of Savitri were known as the Malavas, after the name of their mother, Malavi. Although Malavas are not actually mentioned by Panini, but his sutra V.3.117 mentions a number of tribes aa the ayudhajivi samghas (those who live by the profession of arms) and the Kashika includes the names of the Malavas and the Kshudrakas in this group of tribes. The Malavas are actually mentioned in the Mahabhashya (IV.1.68) of Patanjali. The location of the original homeland of the Malavas is not certain, but modern scholars generally connect them with the \\"Malli\\" or \\"Malloi\\" mentioned in the ancient Greek accounts, which describe Alexander's war against them. At the time of Alexander's invasion in the 4th century BCE, the Malloi lived in present-day Punjab region, in the area to the north of the confluence of the Ravi and the Chenab rivers.  Southwards migration  Later, the Malavas (or at least a large population of them) migrated to present-day Rajasthan, possibly as a result of the Indo-Greek occupation of Punjab. They were probably headquartered at Malavanagara (present-day Nagar Fort), where several thousands of their coins have been discovered. These coins bear the legend Malavanam jayah (\\"victory of the Malavas\\"), and have been dated between 250 BCE and 250 CE. Several inscriptions dated in the Malava era have been found in various parts of Rajasthan, which suggests that the Malava influence extended to a wider part of Rajasthan. The Malavas ultimately migrated to the Malwa region in central India: this region was named after them sometime after the 2nd century CE. =Conflict against the Western Satraps= Gangadhar Stone Inscription of Vi≈õvavarman, king of the Aulikaras, a branch of the Malavas, and contemporary of Kumaragupta, 423 CE. Around 120 CE, the Malavas are mentioned as besieging the king of the Uttamabhadras to the south, but the Uttamabhadras were finally rescued by the Western Satraps, and the Malvas were crushed. The account appears in an inscription at the Nashik Caves, made by the Nahapana's viceroy Ushavadata: = Conflict with the Guptas = In the 4th century CE, during the reign of the Gupta emperor Samudragupta, the Malavas most probably lived in Rajasthan and western Malwa. The Allahabad Pillar inscription of Samudragupta names the Malavas among the tribes subjugated by him. The Aulikaras who ruled in the Malwa region may have been a Malava clan, and may have been responsible the name \\"Malwa\\" being applied to the region.  Post-Gupta period  Post-Gupta records attest to the Malava presence in multiple regions, including present- day Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. = Present-day Gujarat = Xuanzang (also 7th century) locates Malava (transcribed as \\"Mo-la-p'o\\") in present-day Gujarat, describing Kheta (Kheda) and Anandapura (Vadnagar) as parts of the Malava country. Xuanzang suggests that this Malava country was a part of the Maitraka kingdom. Like Banabhatta, he describes Ujjayini (\\"Wu-she-yen-na\\") as a distinct territory, but unlike Banabhatta, he locates Malava to the west of Ujjayini. The 7th century Aihole inscription of the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II, who defeated the Malavas, also locates them in present-day Gujarat. The 9th century Rashtrakuta records state that their emperor Govinda III stationed governor Kakka in the Lata country (southern Gujarat) to check the advance of the Gurjara-Pratiharas into Malava. = Present-day Madhya Pradesh = Although the region that ultimately came to be known as Malwa included the Ujjain, the post-Gupta records distinguish between the territory of the Malavas and the region around Ujjain. Banabhatta's Kadambari (7th century) describes Vidisha in present-day eastern Malwa as the capital of the Malavas, and Ujjayini (Ujjain) in present-day western Malwa as the capital of the distinct Avanti kingdom. This Malava king was defeated by the Pushyabhuti king Rajavardhana around 605 CE, as attested by Banabhatta's Harshacharita as well as the Pushyabhuti inscrpitions. The distinction between these Malava and Ujjain regions is also found in the writings of the 9th century Muslim historian Al-Baladhuri, who states that Junayd, the Arab governor of Sindh, raided Uzain (Ujjain) and al-Malibah (Malava) around 725 CE. From 10th century onward, historical records use the term \\"Malavas\\" to refer to the Paramaras, who ruled the present-day Malwa region. It is likely that the Paramaras were not descended from the ancient Malavas, but came to be called \\"Malavas\\" after they started ruling the Malwa region named after the ancient Malavas. In the Yadava-prakasha's Vijayanti (c. 11th century), Avanti (the area around Ujjain) and Malava are stated to be identical. Thus, it appears that the present-day definition of Malwa became popular in the later half of the 10th century.  Malava era  The era, which later became known as the Vikrama Samvat is associated with the Malavas. Initially it was mentioned as the Krita era and then as the Malava era. Most probably this era was mentioned as the Vikrama era for the first time in the Dholpur stone inscription of Chahamana ruler Chandamahasena in 898 CE.

History =First locations= Founded in Boston, Massachusetts in the late 19th century and in continuous operation since 1897, the society has been non-partisan and non-sectarian since its inception. The society was founded as a response to the establishment of the Scotch-Irish Society which was founded in 1889. AIHS was relocated to New York City in 1904 by T. H. Murray, then serving as society's Secretary-General. Perhaps the most notable member of AIHS at the time was President Theodore Roosevelt. The society's formal purpose is \\"to place permanently on record the story of the Irish in America from the earliest settlement to the present day, justly, impartially, fully, and sympathetically correcting neglect and misrepresentation by certain historians of the part taken in the founding, upbuilding and safeguarding of the Nation by persons of Irish birth and descent.\\" Notable members through the years have included politician William Bourke Cockran, tenor John McCormack, New York Governor Hugh Carey, and performer/composer George M. Cohan. In 1940, the Society moved to a Beaux-Arts townhouse on Fifth Avenue in New York City, which it still occupies. =Recent events= As of 2011, members included \\"prominent doctors, writers, lawyers and even some boldface names like Liam Neeson.\\" It continued to hold a \\"vast collection of rare books\\" and hold various cultural events such as poetry readings and concerts.

Career Born in Wibsey, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, Fassbender (which was her mother's maiden name) began studying classical piano, clarinet and timpani (later also playing synthesizer) at age 13. Eventually she met guitarist Kay Russell, who would become her songwriting partner throughout her career. Both women wrote lyrics and melodies together. Prior to their collaboration, Russell was with poet Nick Toczek in a Bradford- based new wave outfit called Ulterior Motives. After impressing their future manager Alan Brown at a musical instrument shop, Fassbender and Russell signed to independent record label Criminal Records and wrote \\"Twilight Caf√©\\", which was released in 1980. Two appearances on BBC Television's Top of the Pops followed in January 1981, with a band also consisting of drummer Gary Walsh and bassist Mike Close. By this point, ownership of the single had passed from Criminal to CBS Records. In March 1981, Fassbender appeared on German television programme, Disco. Two other singles followed soon after, namely \\"Stay\\" and \\"Merry-Go-Round\\". \\"Stay\\", the second single, was promoted by an appearance on Cheggers Plays Pop, a children's programme. Both tracks were collaborations between Fassbender and Russell. In January 1982, Fassbender and Russell appeared on another British TV show, Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, to promote \\"Merry-Go-Round\\". After release of the latter singles, Susan Fassbender and Kay Russell both retired temporarily from the music industry, to marry and for Fassbender to raise three children. She was married in 1983, when her name became Susan Baggio. Further songs were written, separately and together, by both women, but no further interest was shown by the industry in releasing the new material. A new album of unreleased Fassbender and Russell demos entitled Twilight Caf√© (The Demo Collection 1981‚Äì1985) was released through Platform Records on iTunes and Amazon on 30 April 2012.

It is located 11 kilometres north of the city center, along the Via Flaminia, just outside the Grande Raccordo Anulare. History The zone takes its name from a curious event that occurred to Emperor Constantine the Great, when, during the Battle of Saxa Rubra (312), the labarum fell out of his hand. The labarum was a military standard that displayed the \\"Chi-Rho\\" symbol, a christogram formed from the first two Greek letters of the word \\"Christ\\" (, or ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ) ‚Äî Chi (œá) and Rho (œÅ). According to another theory, the name Labaro derives from a medieval interpretation of the Latin word Rubrae (which became Lubrae and then Labarum). This theory associates the toponym to the name of nearby localities, such as Grottarossa (red cavern) and Saxa Rubra (red stones), whose names are connected to local geological structure. Geography Labaro is located in the northern part of the municipality of Rome, near the GRA and the river Tiber. The territory of Settecamini includes a portion of the urban zone 20M Labaro. =Boundaries= To the north, the zone borders with Zona Prima Porta (Z.

Eastward, it borders with Zona Marcigliana (Z. III), whose boundary is outlined by the river Tiber, up to the Ponte di Castel Giubileo. To the south, Labaro borders with Zona Grottarossa (Z. LVI), whose border is marked by the stretch of the GRA between the Ponte di Castel Giubileo and Via Veientana. Westward, Labaro borders with Zona La Giustiniana (Z.

Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (2001) Rupert D'Oyly Carte, a fellow Wykehamist, appointed Toye as musical director for three D'Oyly Carte Opera Company seasons at the Prince's Theatre in London: 1919-20, 1921‚Äì22, and 1924.Rollins and Witts, Appendix pp. I and II In his first season there, Toye revised the score of Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore, cutting some music and writing a new and more dramatic overture that did not use themes from numbers that Toye had cut.Hughes, p. 138. Thereafter, Toye's overture was always used by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, even when the cut numbers were restored in the 1970s, and it became the standard performance version. He also arranged a new overture for The Pirates of Penzance, but that did not remain in use, and no copy of the score is known to have survived.Shepherd, Marc. Discussion of Toye's Ruddigore overture, A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography As D'Oyly Carte's musical director, Toye impressed the critics; The Musical Times wrote, \\"Mr. Geoffrey Toye is doing his work as conductor conspicuously well. He has made many of us realise afresh how beautifully the operas are scored. He has never-failing vivacity and the right sense of musical humour.\\"The Musical Times, November 1919, p. 626 In 1925 and again in 1927 the BBC broadcast The Red Pen, \\"a sort of opera\\", with words by A. P. Herbert and music by Toye.\\"Broadcasting\\", The Times, 20 March 1925, p. 6; and 7 February 1927, p. 4 In 1927 Toye was joint musical director of a benefit performance for the old D'Oyly Carte leading man, Courtice Pounds, in which Toye was joined by stars from many branches of theatre, including Seymour Hicks, Evelyn Laye, Walter Passmore, Gertrude Lawrence and Derek Oldham.The Times, 13 December 1927, p. 18 =Later years= Scene from 1921 production of Ruddigore, for which Toye had composed a new overture Toye, who had already been made a governor of the Old Vic, became a governor of Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1931, where, as co-director with Lilian Baylis, he managed the opera and ballet until 1934.The Times, 15 November 1932, p. 12 For the Sadler's Wells Ballet company, he composed two ballets to his own scenarios: Douanes, in October 1932, a comedy set in a customs postThe Musical Times, 1 November 1932, pp. 1036-37 described by The Times as \\"delightful and amusing\\",The Times 16 November 1932, p. 12 and, in 1934, The Haunted Ballroom, which portrays the Masters of Treginnis who are cursed to dance themselves to death in a gloomy ancestral ballroom by the ghosts of the women whom they had loved. As in Ruddigore, the curse is passed to the heir of the accursed. The piece makes \\"imaginative... use of an eerie... chorus commentary\\".Lace, Ian. Review of 2001 recording of Tribute to Madam, which includes several of Ninette de Valois's ballets, including The Haunted Ballroom, MusicWeb.UK.net 1 November 2001 The Haunted Ballroom was Margot Fonteyn's first principal role and also starred Robert Helpmann. Ninette de Valois choreographed both works and revived The Haunted Ballroom several times after Toye's death.De Valois revived it at Sadler's Wells in 1949 (The Times, 9 November 1949, p. 7) and 1953 (The Times, 8 October 1953, p. 10); and for London Festival Ballet in 1965 (The Times, 2 April 1965, p. 17). Its last performance in Sadler's Wells's repertoire was on BBC television on 24 February 1957.Dance Chronicle, Vol. 19, No. 1 (1996), pp. 17-92 The original choreography of the piece now survives only in fragments. The Waltz from the score is probably Toye's best- known composition and has been recorded several times. It remained popular for many years as an orchestral piece. From 1934 to 1936, Toye became Managing Director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, working alongside the Artistic Director, Sir Thomas Beecham. Despite early successes, Toye and Beecham eventually fell out over Toye's insistence on bringing in a popular film star, Grace Moore, to sing Mimi in La boh√®me. The production was a box- office success, but an artistic failure.Jefferson, p. 175 Beecham manoeuvred Toye out of the managing directorship in what Sir Adrian Boult described as an 'absolutely beastly' manner.Kennedy, p. 174 Toye obtained the film rights to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. In 1938, he adapted, produced and conducted The Mikado, starring Martyn Green, Sydney Granville and the American singers Kenny Baker and Jean Colin,Shepherd, Marc. The Mikado, 1938 film, A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography but the onset of war prevented further screen adaptations. Toye composed and arranged the music for two other British films of the 1930s: Men Are Not Gods and Rembrandt, both for Alexander Korda in 1936.IMDB In 1940, Toye joined the staff of the BBC, in the American Liaison and Censorship Department. He was twice married, first in 1915 to the actress Doris Lytton,The Times, 27 February 1915, p. 1 and later to Dorothy Fleitman, with whom he had one son, John, who was an actor and then a long-time news anchor for Scottish Television; he took his own life in 1992.Obituary and report for John Toye, Herald 30 April 1992 and 30 May 1992 Toye's elder brother, Francis, was a well-known critic and Verdi scholar. Their sister Eleanor's daughter became a principal soprano with D'Oyly Carte under the name Jennifer Toye.Eleanor (born 1894) first married Joseph Remington Charter in 1923 and then Joseph Richard Bishop, with whom she had a son Francis Peregrine Bishop and a daughter Jennifer Gay Bishop. Jennifer was a principal soprano with D\`Oyly Carte between 1954 and 1965, using her uncles' name, Toye, as her stage name. See, Stone, David. \\"Jennifer Toye\\". Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 May 2004, accessed 25 August 2010 Toye died in London at the age of 53. Compositions and recordings In addition to his ballets, Toye's compositions included several books of songs (including some sea chanties), a symphony, a masque, Day and Night, a radio opera: The Red Pen' (1925, with A. P. Herbert), an opera: The Fairy Cup, and two short choral items: Henrichye's Death, with orchestra, and The Keeper, with brass accompaniment. Toye made very few gramophone records. For HMV, in 1928, he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in recordings of Delius's Brigg Fair, On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring, and In a Summer Garden. The composer wrote, \\"All three... are excellent and I shall be glad to have them sold as authorised by me.\\"See Discography, London Symphony Orchestra website. Delius's helper and amanuensis, Eric Fenby stated that when Delius was close to death, Fenby played him Toye's recording of In a Summer Garden, the last music, Fenby says, that Delius ever heard. See Fenby (1981), p. 221 Toye also recorded The Walk to the Paradise Garden in 1929. Toye's overture to Ruddigore has been recorded numerous times, conducted by Harry Norris, Isidore Godfrey, and Sir Malcolm Sargent (who each recorded the complete opera) and Sir Charles Mackerras, among others. Norris, Godfrey and Sargent all observe some or all of Toye's cuts and other minor alterations in the score.Summary of Ruddigore recordings at the G&S; Discography Toye's only recording conducting a Gilbert and Sullivan work is the 1938 film of The Mikado referred to above.

Biography  = Education and early career = Ulrika Pasch was the daughter of the painter Lorens Pasch the Elder and Anna Helena Beckman, the niece of the artist Johan Pasch, and the sister of the future painter Lorens Pasch the Younger. Her grandfather, the painter Danckwart Pasch (d. 1727), had emigrated to Sweden from L√ºbeck. After the death of her grandfather in 1727, the family studio had been managed by her paternal grandmother Judith Larsdotter until it was taken over by her paternal uncle, Johan Pasch, in 1734.En mamsell i akademien. Ulrica Fredrica Pasch och 1700-talets konstv√§rld. av Anna Lena Lindberg, Stockholm: Signum, 2010. Her cousin, Margareta Stafhell, was a Chalcography artist. Ulrika Pasch and her brother was tutored in drawing and painting by their father. She, unlike her sister Hedvig Lovisa Pasch (1744-1796) was tutored explicitly because she displayed early talent for the work. Hedvig Lovisa never became an artist, though it is mentioned that she left som drawings which were not without talent. From 1752 until 1766, her brother studied art abroad. During this period, her father's career declined, because he had failed to adapt to the new rococo style. Consequently, the family experienced economical difficulties. Ulrika Pasch was therefore, after the death of her mother in 1756, employed as a housekeeper in the house of her maternal aunt's widower, the goldsmith Gustaf Stafhell the Elder. Her uncle, however, allowed her to paint in her free time and develop her artistic talent, and she started to paint and draw for money. It is explicitly stated that she started to take orders as an artist the same year that she year formally became a housekeeper. Soon, she was able to support both her father and her sister as a professional portrait painter. Reportedly, she managed to achieve this success and build up a clientele quickly by her affordable prices.Svenskt konstn√§rslexikon [Swedish Art dictionary] (in Swedish). Malm√∂: Allhems F√∂rlag. 1952. She was able to move into her own apartments and establish her own studio. By the time of her brother's return to Sweden in 1766, she was said to have supported the family for a period of ten years. = Career = In 1766, her brother Lorens Pasch the Younger return to Stockholm, and from that point on, the two siblings worked together. Their collaboration has been described as one of mutual respect and harmony. They shared their studio and guided each other in their work, while their sister Hedvig Lovisa managed their household. Hedvig Lovisa has been described as their dutiful housekeeper, and it is hinted and alleged by contemporaries that Hedvig Lovisa actually committed suicide after the death of her sister in 1796: she died later the same year. Ulrika Pasch is known to have painted details in her brother's painting which he himself found tiring, especially details in textiles and clothing. Pasch had an active and successful career until her death, and was frequently hired by members of the royal court and aristocracy. As a person, Ulrika Pasch has been described as a humble character, who never claimed her work to be anything but a way of supporting herself. She is also described as an easygoing and humorous person, who was easy to be around and could adapt to every situation. = Royal Swedish Academy of Arts = The Royal Swedish Academy of Arts was founded in 1773 and there were 15 members accepted by the academy that year. Pasch was the only female who was made a member that year a recognition which seem to have been considered to be well deserved within the academy. She was made a member at the same occasion as her brother. Unlike her male counterparts, however, she never received a pension from the crown despite repeated appeals. She participated in the exhibitions of the academy, most notably in 1794. In 1798, Thure Wennberg held her memorial speech, Minne af Ulrica Fredria Pasch (Memory of Ulrica Fredria Pasch). Ulrika Pasch is the most famous and successful female artist in Sweden and perhaps also the rest of Scandinavia (among artists who actually worked in these countries) before the 19th century. = Works = * Captain Carl Adolf M√∂llersv√§rd, 1775, oil on canvas, Finnish National Gallery * Catharina Charlotta L'Estrade, 1780, oil on canvas, Finnish National Gallery * Hedvig Ulrika Hedengran, 1772, oil on canvas, Finnish National Gallery * Portrait of a Lady, oil on canvas, Finnish National Gallery * Portrait of Carl Johan von Schultzenheim, 1776, oil on canvas, Finnish National Gallery In fiction Ulrika Pasch is portrayed in the novel Pottungen (Chamber pot child) by Anna Laestadius Larsson from 2014, where she, alongside Anna Maria Lenngren, Ulrika Widstr√∂m, Jeanna von Lantingshausen, Marianne Ehrenstr√∂m and Sophie von Fersen, becomes a member in a Blue Stockings Society organized by Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp, and the fictitious Rower woman Johanna is hired as a nude model by her.

Where shares are acquired, or transferred via a bookbuild, the transfer occurs off-market, and the transfer is not guaranteed by an exchange's clearing house. Where an underwriter has been appointed, the underwriter bears the risk of non-payment by an acquirer or non-delivery by the seller. Book building is a common practice in developed countries and has made inroads into emerging markets as well. Bids may be submitted online, but the book is maintained off-market by the bookrunner and bids are confidential to the bookrunner. Unlike a public issue, the book building route will see a minimum number of applications and large order size per application. The price at which new shares are issued is determined after the book is closed at the discretion of the bookrunner in consultation with the issuer. Generally, bidding is by invitation only to high-net-worth clients of the bookrunner and, if any, lead manager, or co-manager. Generally, securities laws require additional disclosure requirements to be met if the issue is to be offered to all investors. Consequently, participation in a book build may be limited to certain classes of investors. If retail clients are invited to bid, retail bidders are generally required to bid at the final price, which is unknown at the time of the bid, due to the impracticability of collecting multiple price point bids from each retail client. Although bidding is by invitation, the issuer and bookrunner retain discretion to give some bidders a greater allocation of their bids than other investors. Typically, large institutional bidders receive preference over smaller retail bidders, by receiving a greater allocation as a proportion of their initial bid. All bookbuilding is conducted \\"off-market\\" and most stock exchanges have rules that require that on-market trading be halted during the bookbuilding process. The key differences between acquiring shares via a bookbuild (conducted off-market) and trading (conducted on-market) are: # bids into the book are confidential vs. transparent bid and ask prices on a stock exchange; # bidding is by invitation only (only high- net-worth clients of the bookrunner and any co-managers may bid); # the bookrunner and the issuer determine the price of the shares to be issued and the allocations of shares between bidders in their absolute discretion; # all shares are issued or transferred at the same price whereas on-market acquisitions provide for multiple trading prices. The bookrunner collects bids from investors at various prices, between the floor price and the cap price. Bids can be revised by the bidder before the book closes. The process aims at tapping both wholesale and retail investors. The final issue price is not determined until the end of the process when the book has closed. After the close of the book building period, the bookrunner evaluates the collected bids on the basis of certain evaluation criteria and sets the final issue price. If demand is high enough, the book can be oversubscribed. In these cases the greenshoe option is triggered. Book building is essentially a process used by companies raising capital through public offerings, both initial public offers (IPOs) or follow-on public offers (FPOs), to aid price and demand discovery. It is a mechanism where, during the period for which the book for the offer is open, the bids are collected from investors at various prices, which are within the price band specified by the issuer. The process is directed towards both the institutional as well as the retail investors. The issue price is determined after the bid closure based on the demand generated in the process. Process When a company wants to raise money, it plans on offering its stock to the public. This typically takes place through either an IPO or FPO. The book building process helps determine the value of the security. Once a company determines it wants to have an IPO, it will then contact a bookrunner or a lead manager. The bookrunner will determine the price range at which it is willing to sell the stock. The bookrunner will then send out the draft prospectus to potential investors. Generally, the issue stays open for five days. At the end of the five days, the bookrunner determines the demand of the stock for its given price range. Once the cost of the stock has been determined, then the issuing company can decide how to divide its stock at the determined price to its bidders. A criticism of the current process is that it is very manual and communication is done via email, telephone calls and chat rooms. There is strong interest from the investor side to automate this process and reduce operational risk by using an online platform. Real-life application Before Facebook's IPO, the book building process was used to determine how much the stock was worth before it was sold to the public. Morgan Stanley was the lead investor for Facebook's IPO. Initially, the stock was thought to be determined between $28 and $35 a share. The week before the stock was sold, the demand for the stock was sufficient to increase the price between $34 to $38 a share. Once the stock was offered, Morgan Stanley tried to prevent the stock from falling below $38 a share in order to prevent the IPO from being considered a failure. Since Facebook stock initially had a high demand, but this demand fell and its price consequently fell, it was considered that Facebook was overvalued when it was sold at its initial public offering.

At the , Peake had a population of 117. History The town of Peake was proclaimed on 8 August 1907. It was surveyed during May 1907 and its name is derived from the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Peake which itself is derived from Archibald Henry Peake, a South Australian politician who served three terms as the Premier of South Australia. Along one of the major railway lines of the time, many settlers and travelers passed along the route. The town of Peak was the seat for the District Council of Peake which was established on 16 November 1911. In 1997, the district council was amalgamated with the District Council of Coonalpyn Downs and the Meningie District Council to form the Coorong District Council. Boundaries for the locality of Peake were created on 24 August 2000. Peake Historical Walk The Baptist Church, and former bakery, at Peake A walk established for visitors to show the historic landmarks of Peake. The relatively short walk takes highlights all of the first facilities built when the town was settled in the 1900s. The first historical landmark is Polly's Well which is located next to the rest stop. Polly's Well was sunk in 1877 and supplied the whole town with water. The next stop on the walk is the old Station Masters house which was built in 1912. The last station master died in the house and was found weeks later. Next there is the Peake store (built 1937) which is now used as the Tavern. The other historic facilities that are still being used to this day are the Post Office (1912) and the Bakehouse/Church (1908). The final landmarks include Peake School (1929), Butcher Shop (1900s), Saddlery (1912) and the town Garage which was used from 1956 to 1974. Pamphlets are available at the rest stop opposite the town oval. Events A Christian youth music festival, Silos 07, organised by former residents of Peake and the local Baptist church, was held in early March 2007 at the local football ground. Following the success of this event, Silos 08 was held on 11 October 2008, featuring Matt Corby and Fatis Valor as the headline artists. The town population grows by 10 fold during the festival.

Plot introduction The events of this novel take place on the fictional continent of Zamonia, which is also featured in Moers' previous novel The 13 Lives of Captain Bluebear. While Rumo is not a prequel to Bluebear, the two do have many parallel events and returning characters such as Volzotan Smyke, Professor Nightingale, and Fredda the Alpine Imp. There is also a character named Rumo in The 13¬Ω Lives of Captain Bluebear, but this character, briefly seen, is not the protagonist of Rumo and His Miraculous Adventures but rather a different Wolperting using the same name. This epic consists of two separate sections, with both sections together telling the tale of how Rumo the Wolperting became Zamonia's most illustrious hero. Plot summary The first book chronicles Rumo's childhood, beginning with his puppyhood raised by Hackonian Dwarves, his capture and lengthy detainment by fearsome Demonocles on a floating island known as Roaming Rock, and his befriending fellow prisoner Volzotan Smyke. Smyke, a Shark Grub, gives him the name Rumo (also the name of one of Zamonia's most popular card games) and teaches him to speak, watching him grow into a Wolperting - a strong canine creature with small horns and high intelligence. With Smyke's tactical ability and Rumo's strength and agility they are able to escape Roaming Rock but eventually decide to go their separate ways. While Smyke remains an important character, most of the remainder of the first book details Rumo's search for the source of the Silver Thread, a particular scent he visualizes as a thin silver ribbon. The Thread leads him to a city aptly named Wolperting, full of Wolpertings and intensely guarded. Rumo discovers the source of his Silver Thread - a beautiful female Wolperting named Rala. During his time in Wolperting Rumo attends school to learn swordsmanship and receives his first sword, a small, two-pronged, talking Demonic Sword. Desperately in love with Rala but incredibly bad at showing it, Rumo leaves Wolperting to make a token to gain her favor but upon his return, he discovers an empty city and an entrance to the Netherworld. Scenting the Silver Thread, Rumo descends into the dark to rescue the others. The second book describes Rumo's journey to Netherworld/Hel‚Äîa kingdom ruled by Gornab the Ninety-Ninth, a cruel tyrant who is misshapen and insane. Among the inhabitants are the Dead Yetis, the Vrahoks, and Friftar, Gornab's right-hand man and translator who plans to overthrow the throne. General Tick-tock, a terrifying creation of metal and alchemy that leads the legendary Copper Killers, takes Rala from the abducted group of Wolpertings and uses her to perfect his machine of torture (the Metal Maiden). Rumo must fight his way across the Netherworld and back to rescue his kinsman from the horrors of Hel and save his beloved from her seemingly deadly fate. Illustration The book was illustrated by Walter Moers in a cartoon style. Characters ;Rumo Rumo, full name Rumo of Zamonia, is the main protagonist of this novel. He is a Wolperting, a species resembling anthropomorphic dogs with small horns that tend to have two varieties in terms of development. \\"Civilized\\" Wolpertings can speak and walk on their hind legs whereas \\"wild\\" Wolpertings are more dog-like in nature, never attaining the power of speech. Both varieties are equally feared for their almost supernatural abilities in combat, both types instinctively abandon their young in the wild, and both can have the characteristics of several different breeds of dog. Rumo has white fur and a wolf-like appearance with a v-shaped marking between his eyes. Rumo, like all other Wolpertings, is capable of \\"seeing\\" scents by visualizing them as different colors and he has incredibly sharp hearing. Despite his talents in fighting and incredibly fast reflexes, Rumo is perhaps the most dense Wolperting in this novel, making his attempts to win over his Silver Thread, Rala, very difficult. He is determined but a bit quick to violence, with an unusual talent for carpentry and woodworking. His weapon of choice is a two-pronged Demonic Sword that he got at the Weapons Tent at the city fair, though he shows slight regret at his choice in the next few days due to the constant jabbering of his talking sword. Despite this, he forms a partner-like relationship with the two sentient beings forged into his sword, Dandelion and Krindle. ;Volzotan Smyke Volzotan Smyke is a very important character in this story as he is the one that begins Rumo's education by teaching him to speak, a vital trait of a \\"civilized\\" Wolperting. Smyke is a Shark Grub, a primordial creature that has the head of a shark, the body of a Sulfur Grub, and fourteen arms with the ability to emit a foul-smelling slime. We first meet Smyke on Roaming Rock where he and Rumo have been imprisoned as a food source for Demonocles, a kind one-eyed giant with a penchant for eating prey alive. Before being imprisoned on Roaming Rock Smyke had a variety of military positions and seemingly random side jobs, including a stint as a croupier at a gambling den (an experience that served as his inspiration for Rumo's name). By telling Rumo tales of famous battles and wars, Smyke whets Rumo's love for combat and provides exposition for some important characters that appear later on in the story. Smyke has a very active imagination, able to isolate certain events in his past and re-live the memory of them at will. He arranges these memories is a so-called Chamber of Memories, a hallway containing pictures of events and urns containing scents. After utilizing Rumo to escape Roaming Rock, Smyke and Rumo meet a Nocturnomath by the name of Ostafan Kolibri, at which point Smyke undergoes an educational trip into one of Kolibri's five brains for a mental boost, learning about the death-defying instruments of the Non-Exsistent Teenies in the process. Much later, in the second book, Smyke ends up in the Netherworld along with Kolibri and the citizens of Wolperting and has to operate the Non-Existant Teenies' vehicles to revive Rala. ;Rala Rala, full name Rala of the Forest, was born and raised in the Great Forest. Beaten half to death by her abusive owner and separated from her twin, Rolv of the Forest, Rala is raised by the Great Bear God Talon, who is in fact no god but simply an ordinary bear. After Talon's death at the hands of a hunter she reunites with her long-lost brother and the two make their way to the city of Wolperting where she enrolls in school and meets Rumo. Rala is an intelligent, proud Wolperting resembling an Afghan Hound and is the first of her kind to learn to swim, which she does rescuing Rumo from drowning. When Rala arrives in the Netherworld, drugged and kidnapped along with her kin, she is singled out by the fearsome General Tick-tock who tortures and eventually kills her, albeit on accident. She is later revived by Smyke, cheating death and escaping Hel with Rumo. It is left unclear as to whether female Wolpertings see Silver Threads for their male romantic interests, but in the end it is revealed that Rala got a Painless Scar featuring Rumo's name long before she was kidnapped, showing that Rumo's love was not unrequited. ;Dandelion and Krindle Dandelion and Krindle are the two beings whose petrified brains are forged into Rumo's sword. Dandelion was a mining Troglotroll and Krindle was a Demonic Warrior. Dandelion is a conversational sort that is more artistically inclined whereas Krindle is violent and crude. In their sword form they are a short, two- pronged sword with a lion on the hilt. ;Rolv Rolv, full name Rolv of the Forest, was raised in the Great Forest much like his sister, but he was not raised by the Great Bear God but rather his abusive owner. He eventually chews through the post his is chained to and kills his owner in a fit of rage referred to as the White Fire. Rolv is the only Wolperting in the novel that references the White Fire so it can be assumed that it is exclusive to him and not a common trait of all Wolpertings, but it appears to be a brief berserker period in which his innate talent for fighting takes complete control of his consciousness until his opponent is dead. As such, Rolv must suppress the White Fire against opponents he doesn't want to kill. Rolv is a stubborn, fiery Wolperting with the appearance of a Bull Terrier, very different from his twin sister, which leads to a bit of miscommunication between him and Rumo when Rumo first meets him and thinks that Rolv is in a relationship with or pursuing Rala. He does not get along well with Rumo at all as he is very protective of his sister and has a fiery temper. ;Urs Urs, full name Urs of the Snows, is a Wolperting that resided in Wolperting before Rumo and was assigned as Rumo's Municipal Friend (similar to a sort of orientation partner meant to teach new Wolperting citizens the ways of the city and help them along). Urs was raised by a Vulphead duellist and became a very efficient fighter to protect his foster-father, knocking him out before duels and using his name during fights. This attempt backfired, however, as his foster-father became famous for his skills and died fighting a duellist that easily outclassed him. Because of this tragedy, Urs swore off swords and took up cooking. Urs later fights and kills to duellist that killed his foster-father when he is paired up against him in a twist of fate. ;Ushan DeLucca Ushan, lacking a regional indicator in his name common among Wolpertings, is an incredibly weather-sensitive and incredibly skilled Wolperting. He holds the title of the best swordsman in Wolperting, seemingly preferring to use a rapier in his duels. Ushan was raised by a bar owner who made him an alcoholic to keep him under control; his name, Ushan DeLucca, is the name and region of a fine rum. Originally a criminal, he took up swordsmanship very suddenly and never touched alcohol again. Ushan is an eccentric character with the appearance of a Bloodhound who is prone to mood swings based on barometric changes and dreams of a \\"perfect duel\\" the kinds of which have never been seen. To realize this, he built an elaborately booby-trapped fencing garden to duel challengers in. Ushan DeLucca sacrifices himself in Hel in a valiant battle against General Tick-Tock in the Theater of Death, his sacrifice allowing Rumo enough time to destroy the mechanical monster from within. ;Ornt El Okro Ornt, an old Labrador-like Wolperting, is a cabinet-maker in the city of Wolperting renowned for his ability to give advice. It was his advice to make a Three-Fold Token that led Rumo to venture out of the city on the ill- fated day the denizens were dragged the Hel and therefore played an instrumental role in the saving of the Wolpertings by inadvertently ensuring their savior was not captured. Ornt was later killed by the Copper Killers after refusing to kill a puppy. ;General Tick-tock: Fearsome leader of the Copper Killers, General Tick-tock is the result of a collaboration of watchmakers, alchemists, surgeons, and blacksmiths that created him and the other Copper Killers after the Battle of Nurn Forest. He is ruthless and fascinated with death, an interest that leads him to create the Metal Maiden as an instrument of torture that was capable of delivering toxins and medicines through its unfortunate occupant's bloodstream through thin needles studding the inside. He uses this device on several victims before discovering what he thought to be a worthy match in Rala, unfortunately killing her in an act of passion when he discovered that she had \\"escaped\\" him by separating her consciousness from her mind. ;Gornab the Ninety-ninth Gornab is the cruel tyrant King of Hel, the ninety-ninth of his bloodline and thoroughly insane. His bloodline is one of ill-health but sheer luck, and this particular Gornab is also afflicted with a severe speech impediment. Interestingly enough and perhaps a facet of his insanity, Gornab cannot recognize that his speech is any different than any of the other Hellians but understands their speech just fine, seemingly insulted that the other lowborn citizens can't understand him. Because Gornab flies into fits of rage easily in which he hears the voices of his ancestor Gornabs, his royal aide Friftar translates for him, delicately rephrasing the king's sentences as exclamations or reassurances so as to not clue the king in to the fact that he is translating what the other Hellians hear as gibberish. Friftar is in fact leading the king along and biding his time to raise a rebellion, but dies before his dream is realized.

He is best known for his appearances with Eastern Championship Wrestling from 1992 to 1994, in particular his feud with The Sandman. He is the former co-owner of the New Jersey-based Force One Pro Wrestling promotion and school.  Early life  Cairo was a bodybuilder before training as a professional wrestler. As a bodybuilder he placed 9th place in the AAU Mr. America 1985 Medium group.Cario, Tom  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (1988-1992) = Cairo debuted in 1988. In 1993, Cairo wrestled several matches with the Japanese UWF International promotion. = Eastern Championship Wrestling (1992-1994)= Pennsylvania Champion In 1992, Cairo joined Eastern Championship Wrestling, where he used the song \\"We Will Rock You\\" by Queen as his entrance music. On May 14, 1993 in Philadelphia, Cairo won a battle royal to become the inaugural NWA Pennsylvania Heavyweight Champion. He held the title until August 7, 1993, when he was defeated by Tony Stetson. Feuding with The Sandman Cairo was originally an ally of The Sandman, assisting him in his feud with Jason Knight. The alliance crumbled after The Sandman was temporarily blinded following a match and inadvertently struck his wife, Peaches. When The Sandman regained his sight and saw Cairo assisting Peaches to her feet, he attacked Cairo. The Sandman subsequently became estranged from his wife (claiming \\"life's a bitch, and then you marry one\\"), and Peaches became the valet of Cairo. After Cairo insinuated that he was sleeping with Peaches, The Sandman stated that Cairo owed him \\"$25 a romp\\" and began demanding that Cairo \\"pay your bills\\". Following the highly publicised caning of Michael P. Fay in Singapore on May 5, 1994, Cairo and Peaches faced The Sandman and his new manager, Woman, in an intergender \\"Singapore Caning\\" match on May 14, 1994 at When Worlds Collide. After Cairo and Peaches defeated their opponents, Peaches caned The Sandman's crotch until Woman threw salt in her eyes, enabling The Sandman to regroup and use his cane on both Cairo and Peaches. The feud led to a \\"Cane on a Pole\\" match on June 24, 1994 at Hostile City Showdown that The Sandman won after retrieving a second cane from beneath the ring, and a \\"Dueling Canes\\" match on July 16, 1994 at Heat Wave 1994 that was also won by The Sandman. In late 1994, The Sandman was once again \\"blinded\\" after a lit cigarette was pushed into his eye during an \\"I Quit\\" match with Tommy Dreamer. The Sandman subsequently claimed that he would have to retire as a result, with Dreamer responding by dedicating the remainder of his career to The Sandman. Cairo began mocking The Sandman, which led to Dreamer heavily beating him in a match on November 5, 1994 at November to Remember 1994. During The Sandman's retirement ceremony, The Sandman reconciled with Peaches (Woman had abandoned him upon his blinding) before revealing that he was not in fact blinded and attacking Dreamer. The Sandman later revealed that his \\"blinding\\" had been an elaborate ruse concocted to trick Dreamer into hurting Cairo on his behalf. Cairo (left) with Falcon Coperis and Marty Jannetty (sitting) in 1997 =Independent circuit (1994-2013)= Cairo left ECW in the mid-1990s. On June 24, 1995 in Williamstown, New Jersey, Cairo defeated Devon Storm in the finals of a tournament for the vacant NWA North American Heavyweight Championship. He was stripped of the title in 1996 after no-showing a defense, due to the birth of his first child. Between 1996 and 1997 Cairo held the Ultimate Championship Wrestling North American Heavyweight Championship, he wrestled in various matches with the likes of Chris Chavis aka \\"Tatanka\\", Bruce Hart, Jim Neidhart, Falcon Coperis. Between 1998 and 2000, Cairo operated the Outlaws of Wrestling promotion in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In the same time period, he appeared with USA Pro Wrestling, winning both the Heavyweight and North American championships. In September 2001, Cairo retired from professional wrestling and began working as an electrician. In 2007, Cairo returned to wrestling when he, former wrestling radio host Phil Varlese, and wrestlers The White Lotus (Pat Di Giacomo), and Diego DeMarco (James Pilman) opened a professional wrestling school and promotion in the Northeastern United States known as Force One Pro Wrestling. Force One Pro Wrestling held its inaugural event, \\"Pledge of Allegiance\\", on May 19, 2007, in Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, with Cairo, (in his capacity as commissioner) crowning Heavyweight Champion Breaker Morant and Junior Heavyweight Champion White Lotus. In late 2009, Cairo resigned from Force One Pro Wrestling as well, turning the promotion over to Diego DeMarco (James Pilman) & former student turned wrestler Johnny Calzone (John Short), who took the promotion in a different direction, renaming the promotion Force 1 Pro, who ran shows in the same venues as the old Force One. Cairo returned to the business in 2011 with Coastal Pro Wrestling (again with former partner Phil Varlese, and with former NWA official Fred \\"Richards\\" Rubenstein). Coastal signed on as a National Wrestling Allince affiliate, and eventually a licensee, but broke away a year later due to differences with the ownership of the NWA. Cairo eventually split from Coastal after a 2-year run, and ran several shows under the Global 1 Pro Wrestling banner, before leaving the wrestling business again in 2013.

The limestone provides a habitat with rare flora and fauna, such as the Bee Orchid. The village is also close to the limestone valleys and gorges of Hollinhill and Markland Grips, a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest managed by Derbyshire Wildlife Trust.Derbyshire Wildlife Trust The elm trees that gave the village its name fell victim to Dutch Elm Disease and were felled in the 1970s. On 17 November 2012, residents planted a sapling on the village green from an elm that withstood the disease in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Church The Anglican parish church is dedicated to St Peter. It was rebuilt in 1773; it is a simple Georgian building with an unfinished tower and a pulpit with a sounding board. It contains an organ made by Charles Brindley of Sheffield in 1865, which was restored by Martin Goetze and Dominic Gwynn in 2005. The church contains a drawing of Jedediah Buxton made by a Miss Maria Hartley in 1764.

Early life Born in Saint Gilles, Clara began studying music in Anderlecht at the age of seven. During the First World War her father, a civil servant, followed the Belgian government into exile, settling his family in Le Havre. There, Clara sang in a Belgian choir, coming to the attention of choir-master who arranged for Clara to be trained as a soloist in Paris. After the war, she appeared regularly at benefit concerts for Belgian veterans and war wounded throughout Belgium, singing under the name Clary Annie. This brought her to the attention to the director of La Monnaie. Career She first sang at La Monnaie in a production of Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffmann. Taking the stage-name Clara Clairbert, she was considered the prima donna of opera in Brussels from the 1920s to her retirement in the 1950s. Her performances as Violetta in La traviata, a role she reprised over 200 times, and as the eponymous heroine of Lakm√© were particularly popular. She toured regularly abroad with success, her appearances in Manon in Monte-Carlo in 1931, and in Rigoletto at the Opera Garnier in Paris in 1933, were particularly well received. She toured the United States, performing opposite John Charles Thomas and Beniamino Gigli. She retired in 1953 to teach music privately. She died in Brussels in 1970.

To have a certain determination, in some cases, animals should be analyzed in the laboratory or using genetic testing, but often it isn‚Äôt possible. In order to determine the species, with a reasonable margin of error, it‚Äôs necessary to observe the appearance of the animal, in particular, based on some typical features described by principal authors that have analyzed over the years a large number of specimens in the laboratory. The main elements, to determine the various species from photo, are: the appearance of the dorsal marginal plates and spines, the size, the shape of disc and arms. For a good identification by sea photo it is important to take a complete picture of all the subject, a picture of the detail of the marginal plates and to measure as precisely as possible the diameter of the sea star. All this can be done without touching, turning it, or disturbing the animal. Starfishes have two sides: an upper side called ‚Äúaboral side‚Äù (which is normally visible), and a bottom side called ‚Äúoral side‚Äù (which rests on the seabed).

M. Tiffany, 'Mann, Dame Ida Caroline (1893‚Äì1983)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (OUP, 2004) Only six other women were Fellows at this time.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), p. 68 Education Ida Caroline Mann was educated at Wycombe House School, Hampstead, London.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), p. 27 She passed the Civil Service Girl Clerk's examination and took a job at the Post Office Savings Bank.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), p. 46 Despite opposition from her father, she applied to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, the only medical school which was open to women at that time. She passed the matriculation examination in 1914, one of only eight women out of hundreds of passes.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), pp. 48‚Äì49 She completed her studies, 'with no trouble and intense delight', and qualified Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MB, BS) in 1920.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), p. 64 Early career After qualification she had no clear idea about specialising and applied for all available positions as a houseman (a junior role for newly qualified doctors). She was appointed as the Ophthalmic House Surgeon at St Mary's Hospital, London, under Leslie Paton and Frank Juler.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), p. 66 Thus began a lifelong passion for ophthalmic research and practice. During her medical studies she had developed an interest in embryology, working alongside Professor J. E. S. Frazer. Now she combined this interest with ophthalmology and wrote her thesis on the embryology of the human eye, for which she was awarded her D.Sc. in 1924.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), p. 67 To further her career she qualified in general surgery, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1924. Mann was ambitious and determined to reach the top in her chosen field. To her this meant securing an honorary staff post at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, and running her own private practice at Harley Street, London. She had achieved both by 1927. Her stepping stones had been the following posts: Junior Clinical Assistant at Moorfields (1921); staff appointment at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital for Women (1922); Senior Clinical Assistant to Mr A. C. Hudson at Moorfields (1922); Pathologist and Assistant Surgeon to Mr Ernest Lane at the Central London Ophthalmic Hospital (1925); staff appointment at the Central London Eye Hospital (1925). Second World War At the outbreak of war, Moorfields Eye Hospital was commandeered as a first aid post and the staff were dispersed. The premises in which Mann conducted her private practice were also closed down by the landlord. She found new premises for her own practice and then set about re- siting Moorfields. She found hospital premises in Edgware (10 miles from central London), belonging to the Priory of the Holy Sepulchre, secured the lease, moved the nursing staff there and saw the gradual return of the surgical staff.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), pp. 114‚Äì15 There was still a need for a central London site to treat ophthalmic emergencies, and by a mixture of bravado and sheer energy, she managed to re-occupy part of the old Moorfields Hospital on City Road, which remained operational throughout the war despite being bombed. In 1940 she undertook some personal research on the treatment of mustard gas burns of the eye, using laboratories belonging to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund at Mill Hill. It was here she met her future husband, Professor William Gye, the fund's director. When the results of her private research became known, she was put in charge of one of the research teams of the Chemical Defence Research Department under the Ministry of Supply. Working with her friend, Davidine Pullinger, and the biochemist, Antoinette Pirie, she worked out the entire pathology of mustard gas keratitis, which afflicted soldiers from the First World War some ten to fifteen years after they had survived a mustard gas attack. Although the team did not find a cure, they were able to alleviate symptoms through the use of contact lenses.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), pp. 117‚Äì18. Oxford During the war, honorary staff were not allowed to resign from their posts at civilian hospitals. Therefore, when Mann applied for, and was appointed to, the post of Margaret Ogilvy Reader in Ophthalmology at the University of Oxford in 1941, she was obliged to combine this research and teaching post with her work at Moorfields in London, her work on the Chemical Defence Research team and her work as a private consultant in London and Oxford. During her tenure at Oxford, among other achievements, she oversaw the building of the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology, restarted the diploma courses for post-graduates, inaugurated the Orthoptic School and re-instituted the Oxford Ophthalmological Congress. In her own words, she had 'cleared the Augean stable' in nine months.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), pp. 127‚Äì28 Her efforts were recognised by the university in 1945 when she was given a personal professorship: the first woman to receive one at Oxford. She was Titular Professor there from January 1945 until 30 September 1947. Mann was also a Fellow of St Hugh's College, Oxford. Marriage Mann became acquainted with William Ewart Gye, known as Bill Gye, who was Director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund at Mill Hill, and his wife, Elsa, during the war. After Elsa death from cancer, Mann and Gye married in December 1944. Mann became stepmother to her husband's three sons from his first marriage. She did not change her name on marriage, as the complications arising from having two Professor Gyes in the same household were easily foreseen. Australia Mann had first visited Australia in 1939 as the British Medical Association's representative at the 1st Annual General Meeting of the Ophthalmological Society of Australia (B.M.A.). She flew there in an Imperial Airways Flying Boat, which took a week to fly at low altitude from Southampton to Melbourne. She gave a number of papers and made the return journey \\"with the feeling that the gloom of Europe would soon descend, and that this brilliant, sunny and friendly land would be blotted from my memory\\" (Mann: The Chase).Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), pp. 108‚Äì11 In 1949 she and her husband set off for Perth and Melbourne on an autumn cruise.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), p. 138 The introduction of the National Health Service in Britain had drastically changed Mann's work and she was dissatisfied with the impact on ophthalmology. Perhaps more pressingly her husband had retired from Mill Hill and was suffering from ill-health which was exacerbated by the English winters. They were immediately smitten with Perth. Mann purchased a bungalow in Dalkeith, resigned from Moorfields, and arranged for all their belongings to be shipped to Australia.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), pp. 140‚Äì41 Here they conducted experiments on cancer viruses using in-bred strains of mice to ensure consistency.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), pp. 141‚Äì42 She started a private practice as an ophthalmologist, which was always her insurance against economic uncertainty.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986), p. 143 Trachoma research Bill died in 1952, leaving her bereft, 'I was unhinged; so tired that I was almost insane'. She regained her balance by working and traveling. Shortly after his death she took an assignment reporting on the incidence of eye disease for the Western Australia Public Health Department. This assignment extended to four years and provided incontrovertible proof of endemic trachoma among the indigenous population.Ida Mann, The Chase (Fremantle, 1986) She traveled extensively throughout Australia and Oceania studying the incidence of eye disease in different races and cultures, with particular reference to the Aboriginal people. This research produced the classic work, Culture, Race, Climate and Eye Disease (1966). Mann published extensively in the area of eye anatomy and eye disease, publishing many scientific articles and several books. She also wrote on her travels and findings relating to trachoma, published under her married name Ida Gye or a pseudonym, Caroline Gye. These were China 13 and The Cockney and the Crocodile.

It describes the lives of two groups of Italian teenagers during the preparation of the esame di maturit√† (the final exam of Italian high school). It is set in Rome during the year 1989. The inspiration for the title was a famous 1980s song by Antonello Venditti. Plot The film follows two teenagers, Luca (Nicolas Vaporidis) and Claudia (Cristiana Capotondi), and their friends as they all prepare for the dreaded maturit√† (high school graduation) exams during the summer of 1989. At a party, Luca meets and immediately falls for Claudia. The film then follows both teenagers and their friends through their various personal experiences and adventures during the summer. In addition, throughout the film, Luca is desperately trying to get back in favour with his literature teacher (Giorgio Faletti), who will be the teacher sitting in on his oral exams. The film contains many references to music that was popular in the 1980s, and includes songs of the time period by bands such as Europe, Duran Duran (\\"Save a Prayer\\" and \\"The Wild Boys\\"), and Cecchetto (\\"Gioca Jouer\\"). Sequels and remakes A sequel, Notte prima degli esami ‚Äì Oggi was released in 2007. The sequel features many of the same actors playing the same characters they played in the original, but it is set in 2006, during Italy's World Cup winning summer. And in 2011, Italian television station Rai Uno aired Notte prima degli esami '82, a two-part miniseries involving many of the same characters as the first two movies, but using mostly different actors and setting the story in the summer of 1982. A French remake of the original movie, titled Nos 18 ans, was released in 2008.

Biography Hague was born in Bramley, Leeds, to Laurence Hague, a municipal clerk and Marion (n√©e Chalmers). The family moved to Birmingham when he was three years old. Hague was educated at Moseley Grammar School (now Moseley School) and King Edward's School, Birmingham, and took a bachelor of commerce degree at Birmingham University. He was assistant lecturer, then lecturer, then Reader in Political Economy at University College, London, 1947‚Äì57. He moved to be the Newton Chambers Professor of Economics at the University of Sheffield at the young age of 30, 1957‚Äì63. Whilst at Sheffield, Hague also spent a year as visiting professor at Duke University, North Carolina, from 1960-61. During this time, Sheffield University granted him limited funds to visit American Business Schools with a view to setting up a similar operation in Sheffield. This led to one or two summer schools for business people in Sheffield. Subsequently, Hague became Professor of Applied Economics at the University of Manchester 1963‚Äì65, and Professor of Managerial Economics at the Manchester Business School which he helped to set up, 1965‚Äì81. During this time in the mid 1970s, Hague was also a member and later deputy chairman of the Prices Commission from 1973 to 1978. With Norman Strauss he set up a strategic leadership programme at Templeton College, Oxford, and taught there from 1982 to 1997. At the same time he was chairman or director of various companies. Later, Hague became passionate about entrepreneurship and spin off businesses from universities and classed himself as a 'knowledge angel'. He wrote a book about this with Christine Holmes. He was associated with the Entrepreneurship Centre at the Sa√Ød Business School in Oxford from its inception in 2002. One of Hague's first books, A Textbook of Economic Theory, brought him to the attention of Margaret Thatcher (later Baroness Thatcher) and he joined the No. 10 Policy Unit under Sir John Hoskyns. He was chairman of the Economic and Social Research Council 1983‚Äì87. He sometimes wrote speeches for Thatcher and remained a friend of her and her husband Denis.

The aggregation appears as a cap or a patch in the fluorescence microscope and is due to the bivalent nature of antibodies. Patching and capping were critical in demonstrating the fluid nature of plasma membranes. Variations in density within the specimen are amplified to enhance contrast in unstained cells which is especially useful for examining living unpigmented cells. In other words, phase contrast is a contrast-enhancing optical technique that can be used to produce high contrast images such as living cells and subcellular including nuclei and other organelles. One of the major advantages of using phase contrast microscopy is that living cells can be examined in their natural state without being killed, fixed, or especially stained. As a result, biological processes in the cell can be observed and recorded in high contrast with sharp clarity of minute specimen details. When the ligand binds to its specific receptor, the ligand- receptor complex accumulates in the coated pits. In many cells these pits and complexes begin to concentrate in one area of a cell. Cytochemically, this appears as patches of label on the cell surface (patching). Eventually, the patches coalesce to form a cap at one pole of the cell (capping). Not all cells form caps, but most do form patches. The pre-concentration process minimizes the amount of fluid that is taken up in the vesicle.

Publication history The character made his first appearance in The Punisher Vol. 7, #31 (May 2006), and was created by Garth Ennis and Goran Parlov. In a panel at the 2008 Philadelphia Wizard World comic book convention, Garth Ennis stated that the basis for Barracuda was Stagger Lee, a folk song about \\"a large terrifying man and the terrifying things he does to people\\". Barracuda was introduced in a story-arc that lasted from The Punisher Vol. 7, #31 to #36. This was to be the character's sole appearance, though at the urging of his editor, Ennis had Barracuda survive the story; this led to Barracuda starring in the five-issue miniseries The Punisher Presents: Barracuda, then being killed off in a storyline that spanned The Punisher Vol. 7, #50-54. Barracuda was then featured, via flashbacks to his time in South America in the 1980s, in Fury: MAX Vol. 1, #10-12. Fictional character biography Barracuda was born to an African- American father and Biracial mother of French and Irish descent in Boynton Beach, Florida and grew up in Boca Raton, as the eldest of two brothers and a sister. His father served in the 827th Tank Destroyer Battalion during World War II. An abusive alcoholic, his father burned Barracuda's hand on a grill while telling him to be \\"hard as the motherfucking world itself\\" the night before abandoning his family. Barracuda cared for his brother and sister for some time. His brother died and his sister became a prostitute and narcotics user. He got into a fight in elementary school where he shoved his thumbs into a classmate's eyes. After castrating a would-be attacker while in a youth detention center, Barracuda was recruited by the U.S. Army. As a Green Beret, Barracuda's A-team helped the CIA install Leopoldo Luna, a South American dictator in the 1980s. He was also responsible for drug-running in Nicaragua to fund the Contras and committed atrocities against local villages to ensure no resistance; when Colonel Nick Fury investigated, Barracuda humiliated him by making it clear that the CIA and Congress would bury any report, as it implicated too many people. The team went AWOL in Central America after that, though Fury was able to find and assault him five years later.Fury: My War Gone By #10-12 According to his recollection, in another mission in Africa he engaged in cannibalism to prove his masculinity. After leaving the military, he became a feared gangster. At one point he was arrested at the site of a gangland massacre. He had been snorting lines of cocaine off a severed head. He spent time in jail afterward where he struck a profitable partnership with Harry Ebbing, a corrupt and violent corporate CEO. =Fighting the Punisher= Years later Ebbing hires him to assassinate the Punisher, who is investigating Ebbing's corporation, Dynaco (a parody of Enron). Ebbing plans to sabotage Florida's power grid for profit. The Punisher wishes to stop this plan because it would result in the deaths of many innocent people. During his fight with the Punisher, Barracuda loses an eye and the fingers on his right hand. Although Barracuda wins the fight and could easily kill his opponent then and there, he takes the Punisher out to sea so he can watch him be killed by sharks. When the Punisher informs him that he has lost the chance to have his fingers reattached (by putting them on ice without using a plastic bag, since direct ice contact kills the nerve endings), Barracuda simply laughs at his own carelessness. He tosses the Punisher overboard, along with Horace, a local gangster that had wronged him. Barracuda thinks a great white had eaten them both. The Punisher survives and escapes by hanging onto the boat. Barracuda becomes deeply involved with Dynaco and the affairs of the CEO's mistress and his right-hand man Dermot. The plan is to set Dermot up as the new CEO during a shareholder fishing trip. Dynaco's plans, leaked to the media, result in the CEO committing suicide. Dermot ends up talking with the Punisher over the radio. With the full backing of the shareholders Dermot states they can do what they want; the Punisher cannot touch them. The Punisher sinks the boat; everyone on board is eaten by sharks (the crew were handpicked Dynaco employees who had been in on the plan). Barracuda tries to come aboard Frank's boat, only to be shot at point blank range. Like Frank, he survives by hanging on to the boat. =Miniseries= An undetermined amount of time later, Barracuda is approached by \\"Big Chris\\" Angelone, an Italian Mafia boss whose looks and speech patterns strongly resemble Christopher Walken. Angelone has been feuding with Leopoldo Luna about the price of cocaine, so he has decided that his 20-year-old hemophiliac son Oswald will kill Luna with Barracuda's assistance. He does not know Barracuda is an old ally of Luna's. Barracuda immediately betrays Angelone and has Luna take custody of Oswald to blackmail the gangster. He also betrays Luna by sleeping with his wife Wanda and then calls an old transvestite Green Beret buddy Fifty for backup (whom Luna begins sleeping with, not knowing Fifty is a man). Barracuda also seems to display genuine fondness and concern for Oswald, beyond what would be necessary for the role he wants Oswald to play. He refers to Oswald as \\"Hemo\\", encourages him to be more assertive and outgoing, and does not hesitate to risk his life to save Oswald during a gunfight, being wounded in the process. After this, Oswald sincerely thanks Barracuda for saving him. Barracuda has set a complex scheme into motion in order to obtain the money he needs to get revenge on the Punisher. He announces to Luna's inner-circle that he intends to kill the dictator and put Wanda in his place, kill Angelone and put Oswald in his place, restart the cocaine trade between the two factions and get an American reconstruction firm (represented by an accountant he knew in prison) to start up work in Santa Morricone. One of the circle reveals this plan to Luna and he invites Barracuda and Fifty on a helicopter trip to the local volcano, planning to kill them; Barracuda salvages the situation by getting Fifty to show off his penis, causing the dictator to leap out of the helicopter to his doom. Meanwhile, Angelone, angry at being betrayed and humiliated, has been trying to launch a coup in Santa Morricone and successfully swings part of the army to his side. Barracuda and Fifty have to fight their way into the presidential palace to grab Oswald and Wanda and then flee back to the helicopter, but Fifty is gunned down in the second half of the plan and he remains behind to cover their retreat. (To his face, Barracuda seems stoically upset about this, but grins and calls his old comrade \\"dumbass\\" when out of earshot.) They escape in the helicopter and when Angelone (who had grabbed the landing gear) rises up to get his revenge, Oswald shoots his father dead. He and Barracuda celebrate his becoming a \\"hardcore motherfucking gangster!\\" Barracuda then gives Oswald a friendly pat on the back, which due to his hemophilia kills him. Due to the helicopter not having enough supplies, Barracuda and Wanda are left floating in the Pacific Ocean in a boat with no food or equipment. It is strongly hinted that he is going to cannibalize her. =Long, Cold Dark= While formulating a plan to get his revenge on the Punisher, Barracuda receives information from an unknown source that leads him to the home of Yorkie Mitchell, Castle's British friend and former SAS and MI6 agent (retired after the Punisher's \\"Man of Stone\\" story arc). After interrogating and killing Yorkie and his wife, Barracuda stumbles across some startling and very useful information; unbeknownst to the Punisher, he has a very young daughter, the result of a tryst between him and now deceased CIA agent Kathryn O'Brien. The baby is in the care of O'Brien's sister and brother-in-law in La Jolla, San Diego, California. Barracuda travels to La Jolla and kidnaps the child from a day care center, killing a worker in the process. Barracuda returns to New York in order to draw the Punisher into a trap. He secretly sets up a meeting between several criminal organizations in a high rise hotel, knowing full well that such a meeting would attract the Punisher. Barracuda is not at this meeting himself; in fact the criminals are totally unaware of who set up the meeting in the first place. Frank, who is hiding in the ceiling, plans to strike amongst the confusion when he realizes that the entire place, including his own location, has been wired with explosives. Barracuda then steps off an elevator into the meeting and massacres the entire group (with intentions of taking over their businesses once he has finished with the Punisher). Frank joins the fray in order to escape the explosives. The Punisher is the only survivor of the massacre, to Barracuda's delight. He subdues Frank Castle and leaves on a zip line. When the Punisher awakes, he finds himself bound to a chair. Barracuda gloats to him about his plan and reveals his daughter to him. An enraged Punisher breaks his bonds and attacks Barracuda, biting off his left cheek. Barracuda stabs the Punisher in the side and tosses him through the window. The Punisher lands on the hood of a police car and is arrested and hospitalized. Seeking treatment for his own injuries, Barracuda disappears with Frank's daughter. Frank convinces his doctor that Barracuda will come for him and kill many people in the hospital. The doctor assists in his escape from police custody; he uses stimulants so Frank can walk. Later, using his own drugs, Frank travels to California to try to head off Barracuda. When he arrives he confronts Barracuda at the home of O'Brien's sister to rescue Sarah. Barracuda seemingly kills the child but it is a fake meant to disorient Frank. It does not work. Frank subdues the man and tortures the location of Sarah out of him. The child is in a car parked out in the woods. As Frank tries to deal with Sarah's car-seat being booby trapped, Barracuda re-awakens and grabs a gun. He is wounded several times but pursues Frank into a nearby, empty elementary school. Frank loses his three front teeth but Barracuda loses his nose. His hands follow, then his entire head is blown off with his own gun. Sarah is returned safely to her adopted mother. In the next arc, \\"Valley Forge, Valley Forge\\", it is revealed that Barracuda was sent by the U.S. military generals who organized the military operation in the arc \\"Mother Russia\\" to silence the Punisher.The Punisher vol. 6, #55 (May 2008) Abilities and training Trained as a Green Beret, he is a capable and intelligent opponent. He is able to mastermind a coup against Luna, lead his team to victory during the 1980s, and generally find his way out of many binds. He has incredible durability, and has survived: * Knife stab in the eye * Hand cut in half * Garroted by razorwire * Hit by an iron pipe in the head * Shot by a shotgun in the gut. * At least 2 gunshots in arm * Tortured by electrocuting his testicles * One finger broken * Two bullets from an M-60; one in the chest and another one in the leg * Serious third degree burns by an exploding vehicle * Nose literally broken by pliers * Both arms chopped by a fire-axe; another stab to the chest later on * Punisher chewed through him with an AK-47, which finally managed to put an end to him All the time, Barracuda somehow managed to soak up the damage and pain no matter how serious it was and kept fighting back. He even managed to survive for a few seconds from the extremely fatal axe injuries. He is just as resourceful, as seen by his survival at the hands of the Punisher by grabbing the side of the boat which brought him to safety. Barracuda has often demonstrated incredible physical strength, able to rip through steel chains and kick out through the boot/trunk of a car after undergoing torture, as well as a high level of combat skill, as he could fight the Punisher equally. Other versions The Punisher series Barracuda debuted in is set outside the eponymous character's primary continuity, taking place in a parallel universe known as \\"Earth-200111\\". Given the popularity of the character he has appeared in other universes. = Eminem/The Punisher = Barracuda is hired by the Parents Music Resource Center to assassinate Eminem, who he was childhood friends with. He captures both Eminem and the Punisher, but is killed when the former escapes, acquires a chainsaw, and butchers him with it. =Marvel Noir= In Punisher Noir, Barracuda is a Prohibition-era enforcer of Bumpy Johnson, specializing in wrecking nightclubs rivaling those of his employer. He, Jigsaw, and the Russian are hired to kill Frank Castelione, a grocer who had defied mob boss Dutch Schultz. Years later, Barracuda is attacked by Frank's son, the Punisher, while on a date at Coney Island. The Punisher subdues Barracuda by blowing up a ferris wheel, ties him to another ride, and tries to threaten him into revealing who helped him and Jigsaw kill Frank. Barracuda refuses to divulge any information, and dies laughing when the Punisher activates the ride he is attached to, which rips Barracuda in half. =Space: Punisher= Barracuda is as an aquatic extraterrestrial, and a drug dealer with ties to the Six-Fingered Hand. The Punisher tracks Barracuda down to his safe house on the planet Aquarion, wounds him, and forces him into revealing who the Capos of the Six-Fingered Hand are by withholding the device Barracuda needs to breathe while on dry land. The Punisher's interrogation of Barracuda is then interrupted by a trio of hitmen (Sabretooth, Deadpool, and the Leader) sent by Doctor Octopus. The assassins prepare to kill Barracuda and the Punisher, but are themselves killed by the Hulk, who was drawn to the safe house by sonic blasts emitted by the Leader. The Punisher escapes, and Barracuda is left to the mercy of the Hulk, muttering, \\"Uhhh, man... Those dirty $%^&! Look what they done to my crib! Those punk mutha--Um... except you dog. You made the place look better. Wouldn't change a thing. Heh\\". =Marvel Universe= A version of Barracuda will appear in the regular Earth-616 Marvel Universe in the upcoming Punisher Vs. Barracuda 5-issue miniseries by Ed Brisson. In other media * In September 2008, Ray Stevenson and Lionsgate were planning a sequel to Punisher: War Zone, where Barracuda would have appeared.IGN Punisher: War Zone Trailer, Videos and Movies At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, when Stevenson was asked if he signed on for more Punisher, he said, \\"If I had my wish, it's going to run and run. It's up to the fan base. If this works, we get to do it all again\\". After the first film was not received well by audiences, the rights for the characters eventually reverted to Marvel. * Barracuda is a playable character in the PlayStation Network exclusive game The Punisher: No Mercy, released in 2009.

Fuad Stephens was the first Chief Minister of the state of Sabah in Malaysia, and the first Huguan Siou or Paramount Leader of the Kadazandusun community. He played a role in bringing Sabah into the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. While he was initially against the idea of Sabah joining in the Federation, given British concerns about the stability of the region and their move to relinquish all their colonies in the post WWII era, he was gradually convinced to work towards it. He held the chief minister's post from 16 September 1963 until 31 December 1964 when he was forced to resign; and again in 1976 for 54 days from 15 April. During his second term as Chief Minister (which began on 15 April 1976) he died in a controversial accident on 6 June 1976, in Kota Kinabalu, the state capital of Sabah. He was a passenger in an Australian made Nomad aircraft which crashed and killed everyone on board, including his son Johari. His body was buried at the State Mausoleum near the Sabah State Mosque, Kota Kinabalu.  Early life  Stephens was born on 14 September 1920 in Kudat. His father, Jules Stephen Pavitt (later known as Jules Pavitt Stephens, Snr.), was of mixed parentage, half-Kadazan and half-British. Jules was born and brought up in North Borneo in the district of Papar. Jules' father, Ernest Alfred Pavitt was born in Akaroa, New Zealand but had ancestral roots in Colchester, Essex, England, United Kingdomhttp://pavitts.tripod.com/page8.html. When Ernest Alfred Pavitt left North Borneo to live in New Zealand, Jules dropped the name Pavitt and made his surname Stephens. Fuad Stephens's mother, Edith Cope, was of mixed Japanese, British and Dusun ancestry from Kinabatangan, Sandakan. Stephens had five siblings; two younger sisters and three younger brothers. Two of them, John and Martin, died in infancy. A third, Leo Benedict was born in 1926 and later became the President of the Dewan Negara from 1985 to 1988 amongst other accomplishments.P. J. (1999), p. 37 His sisters were Esther (born in 1928) and Agnes (born in 1930).  Political career  Donald Stephens founded the political party United National Kadazan Organisation (UNKO) in August 1961. He played a key role in negotiating the independence of Sabah and the formation of Malaysia, together with Tun Mustapha of United Sabah National Organisation (USNO), Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Tunku Abdul Rahman, the then Prime Minister of Malaya. The formation of Malaysia was finally achieved on 16 September 1963, which is today known as Malaysia Day. He became Sabah's first Chief Minister. In 1964, Donald Stephens stepped down as Chief Minister to become the first Malaysian federal cabinet member from Sabah. He was replaced by Peter Lo Sui Yin from the Sabah Chinese Association (SCA). Stephens became the minister in charge of Sabah affairs under the Prime Minister's department.malaysiana1: What's In A Name? Stephens saw Malaysia as the federation of four countries - Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore - as equal partners, as opposed to the eleven states making up the Federation of Malaya, which had less autonomy.Sabah 25 years later, 1963-1988, Institute for Development Studies (Sabah), 1989, page 56 Following Singapore's exit from Malaysia, Stephens sought a review of Sabah's participation in the federation,ASEAN Forecast, Volumes 5-7, Executive Publication Pte, 1985, page 12 although he was not seeking secession.Malaysia, 1965, page 24 However, this was rejected by the federal government, which feared that such a move would endanger the federation as a whole.Malaysian Federalism: Conflict Or Consensus, Mohammad Agus Yusoff, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, 2006, page 223 In 1973, Fuad Stephens was appointed as the governor of Sabah, known as the Yang di-Pertua Negara (the post was later known as Yang di-Pertua Negeri). He held this position until 1975. Later that same year, Tun Fuad Stephens together with Harris Salleh formed the new political party BERJAYA. They won the 1976 state election, defeating Tun Mustapha's USNO and becoming the new government of Sabah. Tun Fuad Stephens became Sabah's fifth Chief Minister. Forty-four days later, he died in a plane crash.  Plane crash  On 6 June 1976 (\\"Double Six\\"), Tun Fuad Stephens and several cabinet members boarded a flight from Labuan heading towards Kota Kinabalu. About from Kota Kinabalu International Airport, the plane crashed killing everyone on board. The site of the plane crash is marked by a memorial constructed not long after the accident. The site is located in the Sembulan area near the Grace Garden housing complex in Kota Kinabalu across Jalan Coastal Highway from Sutera Harbour resort.  Personal life  Stephens converted to Islam in January 1971, and adopted the name 'Muhammad Fuad', the latter meaning \\"heart\\" in Arabic. Stephens was also encouraged to renounce his surname at the time of his conversion but declined to do so. From 1968 to 1973, he held the post of High Commissioner of Malaysia to Australia.

Plot Free trade through the Bajoran wormhole is vital for the Bajoran economy. Unfortunately, a cloaked ship is attacking other ships, killing the crew and taking all the cargo. The attacking is going after Cardassian ships as well, causing the powerful Gul Dukat to show up. The two sides reach a cautious agreement to hunt down the ship. Unfortunately two Deep Space Nine crew-people are captured by the cloaked enemy. Dukat doesn't care that these people are in harm's way and now the rest of Deep Space Nine's forces must rescue their trapped comrades, neutralize the ship and keep war at bay. Behind the scenes When asked why she wanted to write a Star Trek novel, Scott commented, \\"Partly, I think, it's the simple fact that when you encounter a world and characters that you enjoy, you want to be a part of it, too. In a TV series, that temptation is particularly strong, because, after all, it is a series. There are people out there who contribute the stories, create the world, and there's always the possibility that you can become one of them. In my case, because I came to Trek from the Blish novelizations, and was acutely conscious of how the written versions compared to the actual episodes, the idea of writing not screenplays but novels was very appealing. Plus, of course, I'm a better novelist than I am a screenwriter!\\" Scott remembers how she got the assignment to write Proud Helios. \\"John Ordover approached me, knowing I was a Trek fan as well as an established SF writer in my own right, and asked if I'd be interested in doing a book in the DS9 universe. I really liked the series, particularly the constraints of keeping the show to the single station (this was early in the show's evolution), so I jumped at the chance. I asked if he had any guidelines, any stories he particularly wanted to see, or any he didn't, and he said, no, not really, he'd leave that up to me. So I went home, mulled it over and came up with the proposal that became Proud Helios. I sent it to John, who called me back almost at once, laughing. He'd promised himself that he wouldn't do any stories with space pirates--- and here I'd sent him one he wanted to use\\"Star Trek: Voyages of Imagination The Star Trek Fiction Companion by Jeff Ayers Page #233.

He has previously played for Hull City, Colchester United, Grimsby Town and Carlisle United. Career =Hull City= Edwards was born in Hessle, Humberside, and began his football career as a trainee with Hull City. Primarily a centre back, he made his debut on 28 December 1997 in the Division Three game away to Rotherham United which Hull lost 5‚Äì4, but did not turn professional until the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season. By the time he left the club in March 2003, he was their longest-serving player, though still only 22 years old, and had played 208 games in all first- team competitions. =Colchester United= Edwards joined Colchester United until the end of the season, but was then released, and then after had a trial for Boston United. =Grimsby Town= Following another trial for Grimsby Town, Edwards signed a one-year deal with Grimsby. He spent the season rotating in the team in the centre half position, partnering Tony Crane, Paul Groves and Simon Ford. Following the club's relegation from the Second Division he was not offered a fresh contract and departed the club in May 2004. =Notts County= Edwards was signed by Notts County in May 2004 on a free transfer from Grimsby Town by Gary Mills. He played just 10 games until cruciate ligament damage sustained during a League Cup first round tie away against West Ham United ruled him out for the rest of the season. Under new manager Gudjon Thordarson, Edwards made a remarkable comeback to play in all 50 league and cup games in the 2005‚Äì06 campaign, demonstrating his versatility by operating in central midfield for most of that season. He slotted back into defence after the departure of Kelvin Wilson towards the end of the season putting in consistent and impressive performances. Edwards scored seven times proving a menace to the opposition at set plays. Edwards signed a new contract in May 2006 taking him through until May 2008. He won the club's Player of the Season award for 2006‚Äì07, and before the following season was made club captain. Only weeks later, in a pre-season fixture against St Blazey, he suffered a badly-broken leg and was out of the side until January 2008. He renewed his contract for a further two years in June 2008. He was a regular in the Notts County starting 11 in 2010‚Äì2011 season.

Retrieved 3 March 2013. Edwards was limited to 24 appearances in two seasons with the club, this eventually led to his release at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. In July 2014 he returned to Notts County and played in their pre-season warm up match with Carlton Town, however this was only done as a favour to the player to keep up his fitness levels before the new season. =Return to Notts County= In August 2014 Edwards signed a contract at Notts County as a Conditioning Coach and player until January 2015. Edwards scored his first goal since re-signing for Notts against Sheffield United in a 1‚Äì1 draw on 28 November.

She was a daughter of King Gustav I of Sweden and his second spouse, Queen Margaret. Biography =Early life= During her early childhood, she, as well as her siblings in the royal nursery, were primarily under the care of her mother the queen's trusted nurse, Brigitta Lars Anderssons, her mothers cousin lady Margareta and the noble widow Ingrid Amundsdotter.Tegenborg Falkdalen, Karin, Margareta Regina: vid Gustav Vasas sida : [en biografi √∂ver Margareta Leijonhufvud (1516-1551)], Setterblad, Stockholm, 2016 After the death of her mother in 1551, she as well as her siblings were placed in the care of Christina Gyllenstierna and then under her aunts Brita and Martha Leijonhufvud before her father's remarriage to Catherine Stenbock.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasad√∂ttrarna ['The Vasa Daughters']. Falun: Historiska Media. (In Swedish) They were then under the responsibility of their stepmother and, more precisely, the head-lady-in- waiting Anna Hogenskild. In 1556, she and her sisters were given a dowry of 100,000 daler, had their portraits painted and their personal qualities described in Latin by the court poet Henricus Mollerus, and presented on the Dynastic marriage market. In contrast to her older sister Sofia Vasa, who was described as the most unhappy of the children of Gustav Vasa, Princess Elizabeth has been described as the happiest: she seemed to have a cheerful and placid personality. She was described as blond and pretty. A portrait originally believed to be of queen Karin M√•nsdotter now is believed to be of her. Elizabeth had her own court and was responsible for the upbringing of her brothers' illegitimate children. Karin M√•nsdotter was among her maids before Karin became the mistress and later queen of Elizabeth's brother, King Eric XIV of Sweden. During the Northern Seven Years' War, she apparently showed generosity to Danish and German officers kept prisoners in Sweden. At the dethronement of King Eric XIV in 1568, Duke Magnus II of Saxe-Lauenburg, consort of her sister Princess Sophia, took her, Sophia and Queen Dowager Catherine by boat from the royal palace of Stockholm, to abandon Eric by joining the rebels, headed by Prince John in Uppsala. John stated in the official propaganda, that Eric had planned to present Catherine, Sophia and Elizabeth as hostages to Russia after he had failed to so with John's consort. Both before and after her marriage, Elizabeth acted as a stabilizing factor and a mediator during conflicts between her siblings. She kept in lifelong contact with them all through correspondence, and this could also be political. This is especially true regarding her brother Charles, with whom she was particularly close her entire life. During the reign of John III, the other siblings used her as an informer, as she lived in the close vicinity with John. In the autumn of 1573, the Mornay plot was prepared to assassinate John III. The plot was led by Charles de Mornay, who was in contact with Christina of Denmark and the French ambassador in Copenhagen Charles Dancay. John III was to be killed during a swords dance performed by Scottish mercenaries at the party which was to be given in October that year before the Scottish mercenaries departure to the Baltic. After the assassination, Duke Charles was to be placed upon the throne. Charles de Mornay, who had previously been the favorite of Eric XIV, promised that he knew the location of Eric's alleged hidden gold reserve, which he would reveal after the coup in exchange for better conditions for Eric in prison. However, the plot did not materialize because at the party, de Mornay never dared to give the sign to the mercenaries to take action. In September 1574, the plot was revealed and Charles de Mornay was arrested, interrogated and executed. It was never made clear who participated in the plot. However, it is noted, that the suspected conspirators Hogenskild Bielke, Gustaf Ban√©r and Pontus De la Gardie, often gathered at meetings in the apartment of Princess Elizabeth, meetings where Princess Cecilia of Sweden had also frequently been seen, and the two sisters and their brother Charles were somewhat compromised though they were never accused. Charles de Mornay also revealed, that one of the things which were agreed upon by the conspirators was to raise the dowry of Elizabeth from 100,000 to 150,000, so to make it possible for her to make a marriage of higher status. It is noted, that the marriage between Elizabeth and Henry III of France, which was officially suggested in 1574, could have been informally suggested through Charles already the year before, and that the French ambassador had expressed himself impressed by everything regarding Elizabeth with the exception of her dowry. =Marriage policy= Princess Elizabeth was betrothed in 1562 to Christopher, the third son of Albert VII, Duke of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow. Soon after, however, he was captured and held hostage for several years, and the engagement was considered broken. During the reign of the pro-Catholic John III, they were conflict as to whether she should be married to a Protestant or a catholic. In 1573, John III negotiated for a marriage with Grand Duke of Tuscany, while she herself, assisted by Charles and her sister Catherine, negotiated in secret for a marriage among the Protestant German princes, such as the dukes of Pomerania and Cleves. In 1574, arrangements were made between her brother John III and the French queen dowager Catherine de' Medici to marry her to Henry III of France. Catherine de' Medici regarded Elizabeth as suitable, because she wished for her son to marry a royal princess; because the match was seen as beneficial to maintaining French influence in Poland, and also because it would gain France an ally outside of the Habsburg lands which surrounded France.Leonie Frieda (in Swedish) : Katarina av Medici. En biografi (in English: Catherine de' Medici. A biography) (2005) According to contemporary reports, Catherine also regarded it as benefit that Elizabeth could not speak French, as this would make it harder for her to replace Catherine in her role as the dominant queen at the French court. The French ambassador in Denmark, Charles Dancay, was given the task of providing a portrait of Elizabeth, and gave the following report of her character: > \\"I have been assured that she is very beautiful, has good sense, that she is > pleasing, has a good figure and posture ... everyone recommends her great > humility, in truth Sire, everyone that knows her admires and honors her > virtues ... She finds her pleasure at the spinet and plays it better than > most, she also plays the lute, and she is also of a mild and soothing > temperament.\\" Elizabeth were described by the French ambassador Dancay as beautiful, with an attractive figure and good posture, was praised for her modesty and complimented for her virtues, could play both the lute and the virginals, and: \\"by all regarded as one of the most accomplished and most virtuous princesses in Europe, and that no one had heard of any fault, physical nor in the mind\\". In January 1575, the French envoy Claude Pinart visited Sweden: Elizabeth, being with her brother Charles in Nyk√∂ping, refused to join John III in Stockholm to see Pinart, but Pinart saw her in Nyk√∂ping. The French marriage was almost decided, when the French king suddenly and unexpectedly announced, that he himself had long ago decided to marry Louise of Lorraine-Vaud√©mont. In 1576, John III send count Pontus De la Gardie to Italy to negotiate a marriage between Elizabeth and the Duke of Modena or some other Italian Prince. The purpose was to benefit the contact between Pro-Catholic John III of Sweden and the Pope, and to make it easier for him to attain the Italian inheritance from his mother-in-law, Bona Sforza. However, Elizabeth, supported by Charles, now refused a match with a Catholic for religious reasons. The religious conflict between her and John III was illustrated when, in March 1578, he sent three riksr√•d to her to lecture her: though it is not known what they said, she is reported to have cried and fainted repeatedly after their visit. =Duchess of Mecklenburg-Gadebusch= The Duchess in a lifesize sculpture on the Schwerin grave monument of her husband In 1576, her former betrothed, the now recently widowed Christopher of Mecklenburg proposed a second time, and was accepted. Elizabeth herself participated in the negotiations personally to ensure her economical rights, assisted by her siblings Charles and Catherine, while King John accepted the marriage mainly because he saw it suitable that she marry because of her age. The marriage was delayed because of religious reasons: the staunch Protestants Elizabeth and Charles was careful to defend that the wedding ceremony and everything regarding it should be Lutheran against the Pro-Catholic John III. Elizabeth had the Augsburg Confession translated for the first time to Swedish and printed to the guests at the wedding, likely as a way of demonstrating against the Pro-Catholic policy of John. Elizabeth and Christopher were married in Stockholm 7 May 1581. She arrived in Wismar in Mecklenburg in July, where she was welcomed by the nobility and representatives of the Hansa from Rostock and L√ºbeck. However, Elizabeth was not accepted by the pro-Danish family of her consort. The couple lived in the city of Gadebusch in the part of the duchy of Mecklenburg which had been divided into a duchy for her consort, Mecklenburg-Gadebush. The relationship between Elizabeth and Christopher has been described as happy. Their long wait for each other has been considered a sign that this was not merely an arranged marriage, but also a love match: the preserved letters has also been regarded as an sign that their union was happier and more personal than most royal marriages of the time. Christopher challenged his brother Ulrich about the guardianship and regency over his nephew John, and Elizabeth tried to use her contacts to assist him until the conflict ceased in 1585: her brother John III was however never very interested in helping her. She actively worked for Swedish interests in Mecklenburg and had ha lot of Swedes at her court. Elizabeth was described as an ideal Lutheran princess consort. She benefited Lutheranism, founded a Protestant library and corresponded with the Lutheran theologian David Chytraeus in Rostock. In 1589‚Äì90, she arranged the marriage between her brother Charles and Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. Through correspondence, Elizabeth continued to act as an informer and a mediator between her siblings during conflicts. =Later life= In March 1592, Elizabeth Vasa became a widow. The lands of her consort was then incorporated into those of her former in-laws, which were Pro-Danish and refused her access to her dower lands and income. In 1593, she returned to Sweden with her daughter, which she placed under the guardianship of her brother Charles. She also demanded to be given her dowry, which had never been paid, and wished to discuss a proposal of marriage from John Frederick of Brunswick-L√ºneburg with Charles. In 1594, Charles secured her Norrk√∂ping for her residence and income, where she resided with her court. Elizabeth were given secret document to keep from the royal council by Charles, and during the conflict between Charles and Sigismund, the loyalists of Sigismund kept watch of who she visited and consorted with because of her closeness to Charles, and speculated about her political sympathies. She was present at the assembly in Stockholm in the summer of 1597, were Charles was granted more authority. Elizabeth died suddenly and unexpectedly 10 November 1597. Elizabeth had a grave monument constructed for herself and her spouse in the Cathedral of Schwerin, but in the end she was buried in her father's family grave in Uppsala Cathedral.

Taxonomy and systematics  All tinamou are from the family Tinamidae, and in the larger scheme are also ratites. Unlike other ratites, tinamous can fly, although in general, they are not strong fliers. All ratites evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.Davies, S. J. J. F. (2003) The dwarf tinamou is the only member of the genus Taoniscus and is a monotypic species.  Description  It is approximately long. It is greyish-brown with a pale throat, boldly patterned neck and upper parts, and it has brown-barred buff underparts and a blackish crown. Some individuals are significantly darker and greyer than others, but it remains unclear if these plumage variations are morphs or differences between the sexes. The iris and legs are dull yellowish. It resembles a small dumpy nothura, but is more easily confused with the ocellated crake. = Vocalizations = Its voice consists of high-pitched cricket-like trills followed by peet notes.  Distribution and habitat  The dwarf tinamou is found in the arid scrub grasslands, around in elevation, restricted to the Cerrado region of interior southeastern BrazilClements, J. (2007) in Distrito Federal, Goi√°s, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, S√£o Paulo and formerly Paran√°. Specimens were also known from Paraguay (Misiones) and Argentina (the R√≠o Bermejo in either Chaco or Formosa), but all recent records are from Brazil. It is, however, highly inconspicuous and easily overlooked. Behaviour and ecology = Feeding = The diet of the dwarf tinamou consists mainly of grass seeds, termites, insects and arthropods. = Threats = The dwarf tinamou is currently threatened by the ongoing habitat loss caused by mechanised agriculture, intensive cattle-ranching, afforestation, invasive grasses, excessive use of pesticides and annual burning. It is also hunted by people for food in some areas. Farming and ranching are its largest threats. The dwarf tinamou is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It has an occurrence range of , and the last population estimate, done in 2000, showed between 5,800 and 6,960 adults.BirdLife International (2008)  Status  The dwarf tinamou is currently being conserved in three protected areas: Serra da Canastra National Park, Itapetininga Experimental Station and the IBGE Roncador Biological Reserve. Several areas adjacent to the R√≠o Bermejo, Argentina, have been surveyed with the aid of tape-playback, but the species has not been found. It was also proposed to survey Serra do Cip√≥ National Park, Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park and Emas National Park specifically for this species with the aid of tape-playback. And conduct further surveys in Argentina and Paraguay in the areas where the specimen was collected. It was also proposed to determine best management practices for existing protected areas and control the burning of cerrado habitats.

Known as the 'Grand Old Man of Aston Villa'; he is widely regarded as one of the greatest association football administrators. He was also largely responsible for the design and development of Villa Park. Rinder arrived in Birmingham in 1876 at the age of 18 and became a member of the club in 1881. He first came to the fore in 1887 when Villa built the Grand Stand at Perry Barr, as he was by trade a surveyor for the Birmingham City Corporation and his expertise and contacts proved invaluable to the club. He became the club's financial secretary in 1892, and set about installing turnstiles at Villa's Perry Barr ground. Gate receipts immediately increased from ¬£75 to ¬£250. He introduced many other good business practices to the club. It was his idea to make Aston Villa a limited company. Rinder was also the instigator of the infamous Barwick Street meeting in February 1893, at which he swept away the men who were running Villa into the ground, criticizing the board's tolerance of ill discipline and players' drinking. The following season saw Villa win their first League Championship. He became chairman in 1898 and remained in the post until his resignation in 1925, when he stepped down largely due to the criticism he received for the spiralling cost of the new Trinity Road Stand. However, Rinder's view was that nothing but the very best was good enough for Aston Villa with its stained glass, Italian mosaics and grand frontage. Following Villa's first relegation in 1936, the 78-year-old Rinder was brought back after an 11-year absence. His first act was to introduce a coach whom he met whilst on FA duty at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Jimmy Hogan, who led Villa to the Second Division championship in 1937/38. Rinder died on Christmas Day, 1938.

He received his medical doctorate in 1849, and for most of his career was associated with the University of Breslau. Two of his assistants at Breslau were Hermann Wilbrand (1851‚Äì1935) and Hermann Rudolph Aubert (1826‚Äì1892). F√∂rster is remembered for conducting tests of visual acuity, and for his investigations of indirect vision (peripheral vision) and visual performance across the visual field together with Hermann Aubert. The linear variation of visual performance that they described is sometimes referred to as the Aubert- Foerster law. From F√∂rster's research, the eponymous terms of \\"F√∂rster perimeter\\" and \\"F√∂rster's shift\\" are derived. A F√∂rster perimeter was an instrument used to measure an individual's field of vision. He also devised a specialized photometer to determine the smallest amount of light that will permit an object to be visible. In 1871 F√∂rster defined the difference between negative and positive scotoma (blind spot); if vision of the scotoma region is a void, it is a negative scotoma, and if the scotoma is an area of darkness/lightness or composed of hallucinatory patterns, it is called a positive scotoma.

It is key goal in education reform in many states.  Background  There are theorists who cite the challenge in pursuing excellence and equity in the United States because they are competing democratic ideals. This is demonstrated in the conflicting values adopted by Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. The former pushed for excellent schools that cater to the best and the brightest while the latter wanted schools with equal access and opportunity for all. These positions have gathered their respective followings in the United States through the years.  Balanced policy  The notion of excellence and equity, for modern scholars such as Carol Ann Tomlinson, involves the adoption of strategies that aim for their balance in schools. It is argued that problems will arise without such balance. For instance, the output of the educational system can be compromised if the emphasis is on excellence because high quality can lead to less quantity due to the nature of resource allocation. Education leaders such as Washington's Terry Bergeson have stated that excellence and equity are necessary to build in which all students earn a meaningful high school diploma. These goals will break the link between race, poverty and insufficient academic achievement. Standards-based testing has forced face the facts about low achievement. Graduation requirements requiring passing rigorous tests continue to be a spur to action to address and remove those inequities. Terry Bergeson, \\"Not letting kids off the hook in math\\", March 4, 2007 The National Science Education Standards also name excellence and equity as key goals.

A typical nursery would contain a cradle or a crib (or similar type of bed), a table or platform for the purpose of changing diapers (also known as a changing table), a rocking chair, as well as various items required for the care of the child (such as baby powder and medicine). A nursery is generally designated for the smallest bedroom in the house, as a baby requires very little space until at least walking age; the premise being that the room is used almost exclusively for sleep. However, the room in many cases could remain the bedroom of the child well into his or her teenage years, or until a younger sibling is born, and the parents decide to move the older child into another larger bedroom, if one should be available. In Victorian and Edwardian times, for the wealthy and mid-tier classes, a nursery was a suite of rooms at the top of a house, including the night nursery, where the children slept, and a day nursery, where they ate and played, or a combination thereof. The nursery suite would include some bathroom facilities and possibly a small kitchen. The nurse (nanny) and nursemaid (assistant) slept in the suite too, to be within earshot of the sleeping children. The schoolroom might also be adjacent, but the governess, whose job it was to teach the children, would not be part of the nursery; she would have her own bedroom, possibly in another wing. Fictional portrayals of nurseries abound, for example in the writings of Kipling and E.

It also sometimes engulfs pebbles and digests the biofilm and small invertebrates adhering to the surface. Astropecten polyacanthus contains the potent neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin, also known as TTX which has no known antidote. In a case of paralytic poisoning in Japan it was found that the victim had eaten a trumpet shell, Charonia lampas, which had acquired the toxin through its food chain, thus implicating Astropecten polyacanthus. In a study that followed this incident, most of the 54 comb stars assayed contained TTX, with one individual having a toxicity score of 520 mouse units per gram. Use in aquaria The comb star is sometimes kept in reef aquaria where it is efficient at clearing detritus and uneaten food from the sand or gravel.

It lies within the Gryffe Valley between the villages of Kilmacolm and Bridge of Weir, falling on the boundary between the modern Inverclyde and Renfrewshire council areas. Now a residential commuter village, Quarrier's was constructed as the Orphans Homes of Scotland in the late 19th century by philanthropist William Quarrier. In modern times, these orphans' homes and associated buildings have been converted into private housing and some expansion has taken place with new residential development. A charity under the name of Quarriers continues the work of the former homes and is based within the village. History The Old Schoolhouse The village was founded as the Orphan Homes of Scotland in 1876 by Glasgow shoe-maker and philanthropist William Quarrier on the site of the former Nittingshill Farm. Quarrier had a vision of a community allowing the young people in his care to thrive, set in a countryside environment and housed in a number of grand residences under a house-mother and father. This vision was realised by a number of donations from Quarrier and his friends. A devout Christian, Quarrier's homes also had a distinct religious ethos. He commissioned the building of Mount Zion Church - known informally as the Children's Cathedral - and his values are also reflected in the naming of streets in the village, such as Faith Avenue, Hope Avenue, Love Avenue, Praise Avenue and Peace Avenue. In 2006, Mount Zion Church decided it could no longer justify such a large premises and moved to one of the nearby homes. The church itself has been converted into private dwellings after the initial rejection of planning permission by the local authority was successfully appealed by the developer to the Scottish Ministers. Until 1999, it was also the site of the Bridge of Weir Hospital, opened as a tuberculosis sanatorium. The main section of the hospital has now been converted into residential flats. Hunter House, also commissioned by Quarrier and completed three years after his death, served as Scotland's only residential epilepsy assessment centre until the facility moved to The William Quarrier Scottish Epilepsy Centre, which opened in Glasgow in 2013. Quarriers is a registered charity and still functions to help disadvantaged young people, carers and adults with disabilities in the United Kingdom and beyond. However, due to the changing nature of childcare, the number of children being cared for in the village fell dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s, and most of the homes were sold off privately. The village now attracts a number of tourists and offers a coffee shop. Greenock Morton Football Club train in the village. Geography Quarrier's Village lies within the moorland of the Gryffe Valley immediately south of the River Gryffe. The settlement is bisected by the Gotter Water, a tributary of the Gryffe, with the majority of the village standing on its north bank. A number of both vehicle and footbridges cross the Gotter Water within the village whilst the Gryffe is crossed by a road bridge, Craigends Bridge, at the edge of the settlement, and a two pedestrian bridges.Ordnance Survey mapping One of these footbridges over the Gryffe links the community with the Forth to Clyde cycle route (National Cycle Route 75), which was formerly the line of the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway. Architecture Sabbath School Home (1894), built from funds donated by Sunday School children across Scotland, later serving as a home for adults with epilepsy. One of the few examples of Scottish Baronial architecture in the village. Each of the residential houses built in Quarrier's Village were to an individual design, with donors having a large influence in the style in which their cottages were cast, and also the buildings' names. As such, the village is an unusual mix of Gothic, French, Old English, Scottish baronial and Italian. The overall plan of the village is of a more English style than is typical in the area, with a parkland and village green-type layout.Love Avenue and Its Fascinating Architecture, Quarriers informational board number 7 Only three houses in the village can be directly traced to traditional Scottish architecture. Despite this mix of styles, one architect is responsible for virtually the entire old village: Robert Bryden of the Clarke and Bell firm in Glasgow. Bryden worked free of charge on Quarrier's projects over a course of some twenty-eight years. Local government Quarrier's Village is part of the civil parish of Kilmacolm and continues to be associated with it for the purposes of local government. The Kilmacolm Community Council represents its interests to the local authority, Inverclyde Council. For local government electoral purposes, Kilmacolm and Quarrier's Village both form part of the Inverclyde East electoral ward. There is also a residents' association for the village, the Quarrier's Village Council.http://www.inverclyde.gov.uk/NewsR.aspx?id=533 Notes =References= * Overview of Quarrier's Village, Gazetteer for Scotland External links * Quarrier's charity website Category:Villages in Inverclyde Category:Orphanages in the United Kingdom Category:Strathgryffe Category:Childhood in Scotland ","title":"Quarrier's Village"},{"id":"9857623","text":"\\"Ieya\\" is the fourth UK single from the post-punk band Toyah, fronted by Toyah Willcox, and was released in 1980.

The show, according to Toyah, had gone phenomenally well, but the band had trouble with the National Front. Toyah explained: \\"At the end of the concert the NF were so incensed that the police were called and had to get us out via the Gents window at the back and into a police van, because the NF were outside, kicking in cars, waiting for us at the stage door to kick our heads in. A full-blown riot was in progress\\", Toyah remembered. \\"IEYA\\", according to the singer, \\"is about mankind believing in ourselves so much that we believe we are immortal and can become our own gods, therefore challenging God as the Devil, in the form of the Devil; man being the beast\\". = Necronomicon reference = Necronomicon reference (\\"Zion, Zuberon, Necronomicon\\") had to do with a paranormal experience of her own.

It was released by New World Pictures. Plot Fifteen-year-old honor student Molly Stewart (Donna Wilkes) attends private prep school in the Los Angeles area in the daytime, but transforms herself to \\"Angel\\" at night: a leather mini- skirted, high-heeled street teenage prostitute who works Hollywood Boulevard. Angel has a \\"street family\\" made up of aging movie cowboy Kit Carson (Rory Calhoun), street performer Yoyo Charlie (Steven M. Porter), transvestite Mae (Dick Shawn), fellow hookers Crystal (Donna McDaniel) and Lana (Graem McGavin), and her landlord, eccentric painter Solly Mosler (Susan Tyrrell). The street's dangers increase as a psycho-necrophiliac serial killer (John Diehl) begins to stalk and murder prostitutes. Los Angeles Police Lt. Andrews (Cliff Gorman) is assigned to the case, but finds no leads. Tragedy strikes Angel's group of friends when Crystal becomes a victim. The next day at school, Molly is confronted by teacher Patricia Allen (Elaine Giftos), who is concerned about Molly's lack of extracurricular activities. Molly explains that her mother was paralyzed by a stroke and she has to head home immediately after school each day to care for her. Lt. Andrews advises the hookers to work in pairs. Angel teams up with her partner, Lana. Lana takes a potential client to a motel room that she and Angel share. When Angel shows up at the room with a client of her own a couple of hours later she finds Lana's body in the shower. Angel gives the police a description of the suspect and a composite sketch is made. The killer is brought in for a lineup and Angel recognizes him, but he shoots his way out of the police station and escapes. Andrews takes Molly/Angel home to speak with her parents, but discovers that Molly's father left nine years ago and her mother abandoned her three years ago. Molly maintains the pretense of a mother at home so that she will not be sent to a foster home. She believes that her father will return someday. She has paid her rent, school tuition and living expenses through prostitution since she was 12. Despite Andrews' warnings to stay off the street, Angel/Molly purchases a pistol and returns to work. Her masquerade falls apart that night when some classmates recognize her on the street. Word flashes through the students at her school and soon everyone knows that Molly spends her evenings as a Hollywood hooker. The next day, Ms. Allen visits Molly's apartment and insists on meeting her mother. Mae pretends to be Molly's mother, but Allen is not fooled. Mae is still at the apartment when the killer shows up later. They fight, and he stabs her, leaving her mortally wounded. Solly discovers Mae and the two share a tender moment of friendship before Mae succumbs to her wounds. Andrews and Molly return to her apartment and find Mae's body. Molly heads out on the streets with Solly's huge long-barreled Magnum to avenge Mae and Andrews goes after her. After a fight and chase, Carson, whom Andrews enlisted to help, shoots the killer. Molly, Andrews, and a wounded Carson walk off together and the film fades to black. Cast =Main= * Donna Wilkes as Molly 'Angel' Stewart * Cliff Gorman as Lt.

The film failed to open in the top 5 at the box office, yet grossed $2.2 million on its opening weekend. The film managed to stay in the box office top ten for several months, becoming a sleeper hit and eventually earning $17,488,564. It was New World's highest grossing picture that year. Sequels The film's cult following and box office profits were enough to spawn three sequels, although each with a different actress. The sequels were Avenging Angel (1985), starring Betsy Russell, Angel III: The Final Chapter (1988), starring Mitzi Kapture, and Angel 4: Undercover (1993), starring Darlene Vogel. All three of them were commercial failures at the box office. Production Lead actress Donna Wilkes was actually twenty-four years old when she played fifteen-year-old Molly Stuart in this film. She prepared for the role by talking to real-life street prostitutes on Hollywood Boulevard, spent time with the Los Angeles Police Department, and in various halfway houses for underage children living on the streets of Los Angeles. Composer Craig Safan wrote the score to this film in less than a week. The film premiered at the Hollywood Pacific Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. A fact sheet inside the theatre, prior to its closure in 1994, confirmed this. The theatre is also featured in the climax of the film, when a gun-toting Angel opens fire on the killer and terrifies the patrons outside. The motel in the film is the El Royale Motel at 11117 Ventura Boulevard, Studio City.El Royale Motel Most of the film was shot at real locations on and around Hollywood Boulevard. DVD release In 2003, Anchor Bay Entertainment released the Region 1 DVD box set of the first three Angel films entitled The Angel Collection.The Angel Collection product info Soundtrack Craig Safan's score was released on compact disc by Intrada Records in 1993. In 2013 BSX Records released a compilation album called The Angel Trilogy, featuring Safan's album programme (plus a cover version of the Allies' \\"Something Sweet\\" as performed by Melody Michalski), Christopher Young's score for Avenging Angel (also previously released by Intrada) and Eric Allaman and Reinhard Scheuregger's music for Angel III: The Final Chapter.

Human rights defenders find little protection in the Colombian justice system; 784 human rights defenders were threatened, attacked or murdered between 2002 and 2009, there has been a conviction in only 10 of these cases.US Office on Colombia, Still Waiting for Justice, September 2010 =Labour Rights in Colombia= link= Colombia is widely referred to as the most dangerous country in the world to be a trade unionist.ITUC, Worldwide Survey: Repression of union rights and economic freedoms across the globe, 8 June 2011USLEAP, Violence Against Colombian Trade Unionists: Fact vs. Myth, June 2011 The 2011 Annual Survey of Violation of Trade Union Rights published by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) reports that 49 trade unionists were killed in Colombia in 2010, more than in the rest of the world put together. According to government figures, 37 unionists were murdered.Colombian Embassy, Protecting Labor and Ensuring Justice in Colombia Between January and August 2011, 19 trade unionists have been reported killed.ITUC, Asesinato de lider minero en Colombia, 16 August 2011 The ITUC reports that between 2000 and 2010 Colombia has accounted for 63.12% of trade unionists murdered globally.ITUC, ITUC responds to press release issued by Colombia Interior Ministry, 11 June 2010 According to Human Rights Watch and Justice for Colombia, most of these murders are attributed to right-wing paramilitaries, whilst some are directly attributed to state forces.Human Rights Watch, World report 2011: ColombiaJustice for Colombia Anti-Trade Union Violence Amnesty International reported in 2007 that for cases in which the perpetrator was known, paramilitaries were responsible for 49% of the attacks against trade-unionists, state forces were responsible for 43%, and the guerrilla forces were responsible for 2%.Amnesty International The Reality of Trade Unionism in Colombia , 3 July 2007 According to the National Labour School (ENS), a Colombian NGO monitoring trade union violence, impunity for crimes committed against trade unionists is running at 94%. Trade union membership in Colombia has fallen dramatically since the 1980s.The Solidarity Center The Struggle for Worker Rights , May 2006 According to Justice for Colombia, a British NGO campaigning for human rights and an end to trade union violence in Colombia, this is due to a combination of factors: 'Less than 5% of Colombian workers are members of trade unions ‚Äì the lowest level in the Americas. Less than twenty years ago it was double that figure but violence against trade unionists, changes in the labour market and anti- trade union policies have led to a huge decrease in membership. Today only 850,000 Colombians are members of a trade union'.Justice for Colombia Workers' Rights in Colombia As demonstrated by figures from the ENS, such is the nature of the Colombian workforce, it is very difficult for the majority of Colombian workers to join a trade union: 'of Colombia's 18 million working people...11 million are working in the informal economy....Of the remaining 7 million people (who do have formal employment) only 4 million benefit from permanent employment contracts'. link= Colombia has ratified 60 ILO conventions and the eight conventions on fundamental labour rights. However, Justice for Colombia reports that in 2011 Colombians are still working in 'conditions so poor that they violate both ILO conventions and Colombian national law'.Justice for Colombia Workers Persecuted for Strike Action, 24 August 2011 Up until 2010, Colombia had featured every year for 21 years on the ILO blacklist of countries to be investigated for non-compliance with conventions concerning labour rights.Colombia anuncia salida de lista negra de OIT , Associated Press, 2 June 2010 Colombia's removal from the ILO blacklist list in 2010 was cited by Colombian officials as a demonstration that respect for trade unions and for labour rights had improved in Colombia.Uribe destaca exclusion de Colombia de lista negra de OIT, El Espectador, 5 June 2010 However, the UK's Trade Union Congress (TUC) points out that in 2010 the ILO also made an agreement with the Colombian government to send a high level commission to visit the country in response to the continued violation of labour rights.TUC, Solidarity with Colombian Trade Unions , 17 June 2010 Two of Colombia's three major trade union centres, the CUT and the CTC, released a statement in 2010 in response to the decisions made by the ILO: 'the acceptance of a High Level Tripartite Mission on the part of the Colombian government implies that the State accepts it has not complied with ILO requirements in a satisfactory way.... at no point has ILO indicated that the issues of human rights and freedom of association have been solved'.CUT and CTC Statement , June 2010 =Legal Rights in Colombia= Whilst the right to due process in all legal processes is a right decreed to Colombians in article 29 of the Colombian constitution, human rights observers regularly report failures to provide this and indeed other legal rights.Colombian Constitution of 1991, Art. 29 The 2011 report from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for Colombia reports that 'the prosecution and arbitrary detentions of human rights defenders on the basis of uncorroborated information provided mainly by informants, demobilized persons and military intelligence reports, continue to be of concern'.UNHCHR Report of the UNHCHR on the human rights situation in Colombia , A/HRC/16/22, 3 February 2011 According to the respected Jesuit human rights defender, Padre Javier Giraldo, between August 2002 and August 2004 there were 6332 arbitrary detentions.Padre Giraldo, Javier, Carta de objeci√≥n de conciencialink=Shortcomings in legal processes have been reported in cases concerning trade unionists, community activists, academics, and other groups and individuals who, whilst seeking the advancement of rights in their relevant spheres, may oppose certain elements of state policy.Human Rights Watch, Stop False Accusations against Human Rights Groups, 19 November 2008 According to both Colombian and international organisations, the response from the state has often been in the form of illegal criminal proceedings.MOVICE, La falta de garant√≠as para las v√≠ctimas de crimines de Estado, 7 April 2010Humanidad Vigente, Rel√°mpagos de justicia en el Catatumbo, 21 May 2010Justice for Colombia, Help Free Colombian Political PrisonersFIDH, Seria preocupaci√≥n por defensores de derechos humanos, 21 July 2011 Such characteristics led Human Rights First, in a report looking into the prosecution process in cases brought against human rights defenders, to conclude that 'corruption and failure to abide by national and international due process standards are endemic to the criminal justice system in Colombia'. One example of organisations being persecuted illegally through the courts is that of ACVC, a grass-roots peasant farmer organisation focused on human rights issues in rural Colombia. Between 2007 and 2008 all six members of its executive committee were arrested on charges of rebellion. In April and May 2008 charges were dropped against all but two with the reviewing prosecutor stating that the witnesses' testimony was \\"based on no more than personal opinion and should have been verified forcefully by the investigative agencies\\". The remaining two, in spite of being detained on the back of the same testimony, were forced to remain in jail. Miguel Gonzalez was released without charge in June 2009, one year and six months after he was originally arrested. Andres Gil was the last to be released; he was detained for almost two years with no conviction ever being made. =Political Rights in Colombia= According to a Colombian group focused on solidarity with political prisoners, Traspasa los Muros, there are 7,200 people being kept in jails across Colombia as a result of their political activities or beliefs.Traspasa los Muros Justice for Colombia talks of 'over 5,000' political prisoners.Justice for Colombia, British academics call for release of Colombian political prisoner, 3 November 2010 The British MP Jim McGovern released a statement in 2010 in support of a campaign run by Justice for Colombia calling for the release of Colombia's political prisoners: 'These people are innocent men and women who have been imprisoned simply because they disagree with the Government or criticise Government policies. The Colombian authorities have to understand that jailing people in order to silence their opinions is completely unacceptable'.Colombia Reports, British MPs call on Colombia to free political prisoners, 17 November 2010 According to the Colombian victims' organisation MOVICE, these detentions are used to obstruct the activities carried out by those working to denounce human rights abuses whilst at the same time acting to delegitimise and criminalise their work.link=Colombia has a past and present history of politically motivated violence. Hernando Hernandez, an elected representative for Colombia's indigenous, denounced that five members of his Democratic Pole party had been killed in the lead up to the 2011 elections.Justice for Colombia, Systematic effort to push opposition out of politics, 31 August 2011 In August 2011, the senator and victims' rights leader Ivan Cepeda revealed that he was informed of a murder plot being planned against him by two state security prison guards.El Espectador, Gobierno inici√≥ investigaci√≥n en INPEC por caso de Ivan Cepeda, 25 August 2011 Between 1984 and 1994 Colombia suffered the genocide of a political party called the Patriotic Union (UP).Reiniciar, El genocidio contra la √önion Patri√≥tica en la CIDH The UP was born as a result of negotiations held in 1984 between the FARC, Colombia's oldest and largest guerrilla group, and the Colombian government that were to allow FARC members and supporters to follow an electoral path in order to advance their political objectives.Reiniciar, El genocidio contra la √önion Patri√≥tica By 1994, between 3,000 and 5,000 members were assassinated in a systematic campaign to wipe-out the party and its members. A Colombian human rights organisation dedicated to the search for justice for the victims of the UP calls the genocide 'an alarming and representative case of a persecution of an opposition movement'. In August 2011, the Colombian state, recognising its responsibility, apologised for the 1994 assassination of the last UP senator, Manuel Cepeda Vargas.Fellowship of Reconciliation, The Power of Granting Forgiveness , 24 August 2011 In 2006, a scandal was uncovered in Colombia which showed a program of espionage against perceived political opponents of the government had been in operation.Washington Post, US aid implicated in abuses of power in Colombia, 21 August 2011 The wiretapping of phones and emails of human rights defenders, judges, politicians and international human rights organisations was carried out by the state intelligence agency, the Department for Administrative Security (DAS). The 2011 report from the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights commented on the continuing developments in the scandal: 'Investigations continued on former directors for illegal surveillance between 2005 and 2008. Statements by DAS senior personnel implicated former senior officials of the President's office as beneficiaries of the illegally obtained information'. =Economic Rights in Colombia= In its 2010 report, the UN Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights expressed its concern at \\"the wide inequalities in the distribution of income in the State party in the context of poverty.\\" It is particularly concerned that the taxation system is regressive and more favourable to persons from the highest income groups.Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Colombia , E./C.12/COL/CO/5, Paragraph 14, 21 May 2010 The Constitutional Court was commended by the report for establishing 'criteria for determining the legal minimum wage, the right to fair remuneration and maintenance of purchasing power',Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Colombia , E./C.12/COL/CO/5, Paragraph 5, 21 May 2010 but the unequal land distribution and lack of agrarian reform was a further concern mentioned by the committee. According to the UK pressure group ABColombia, 0.4% of landholders own 61% of the rural land in Colombia.ABColombia, Poverty, Inequality and Drugs In 2015, the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) reported that 27.8% of the population were living below the poverty line, of which 7.9% in \\"extreme poverty\\". In rural zones, extreme poverty is as high as 18.0%. Vulnerable populations =LGBT rights= Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights in Colombia have progressed since consensual homosexual activity was decriminalized in 1980 with amendments to the Criminal Code, making it one of Latin America's most advanced countries in regard to LGBT rights legislation. Between February 2007 and April 2008, three rulings of the Constitutional Court granted registered same-sex couples the same pension, social security and property rights as for registered heterosexual couples. In 2011, Congress passed a law banning discrimination based on sexual orientation. On 28 April 2016, the Constitutional Court legalized same-sex marriage. =Intersex rights= In 1999, the Constitutional Court of Colombia became the first court to consider the human rights implications of medical interventions to alter the sex characteristics of intersex children. The Court restricted the age at which intersex children could be the subjects of surgical interventions. Morgan Holmes states that, while children who reach the same age and circumstances will be in the same position, then they will \\"be permitted access to the conditions that protect their autonomies\\". Other intersex children will not benefit, in particular at the point they are born: \\"In its worst potential implications and uses, the court's decision may simply amplify the need to expedite procedures\\".

Swaminathan (21 June 1928 ‚Äì 1994) was a leading Indian artist, painter, poet and writer. He was a member of the Communist Party of India. He is one of the most influential artists of India, instrumental in establishment of the Bharat Bhawan, a muti-art complex in Bhopal, in 1982, and served as the director of its Roopankar art Museum till 1990. He discovered, Jangarh Singh Shyam, the first known modern-day Gond tribal artist of Madhya Pradesh state in India. Biography J Swaminathan was born in Shimla on 21 June 1928. After schooling in Delhi, he joined a pre- medical course, but he left the course as well as his home when ran away to Kolkata, where he did some odd jobs to earn living. However he returned to Delhi and joined the Congress Socialist Party and also appointed sub-editor of a Hindi short story magazine, and subsequently as an editor of Mazdoor Awaz magazine, eventually joining the Communist Part of India in 1948. Meanwhile, he started taking evening classes at the Delhi Polytechnic, Kashmere Gate, where he trained under artists Sailoz Mukherjee and Bhabesh Chandra Sanyal. However his art study didn't last long as he couldn't manage the stress of working during the day, attending art classes in the evenings at the same time. In 1957, he joined the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. Upon his return to India in 1960, he held his first major exhibition, displaying his graphic prints and oil paintings, along with artists P.K. Razadan and N. Dixit. By the end of 1960s, he had left journalism to take up art full-time. J. Swaminathan was one of the co-founders of short-lived artists group \\"GROUP 1890\\" founded in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, in August 1962,. Other 11 members of the group included Jeram Patel (1930), Rajesh Mehra, Ambadas Khobragade ( 1923-2012)Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh (1937), Eric Bowen (1929-2002), Himmat Shah (1933), Nagji Patel, Redappa Naidu and Jyoti Bhatt (1934). He was awarded the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship in 1968 for research on project \\"The significance of the traditional Numan to Contemporary Art\\". A major contribution by J. Swaminathan was that he helped vernacular painters from tribes like Gond and Bhil to gain international recognition. In 1981, Swaminathan discovered a young gond artist Jangarh Singh Shyam painting on the mud walls of his house, who became the first known modern Gond artist . Recognizing the potential of his talent, Swaminathan took him to the city and held painting exhibitions where Shyam‚Äôs paintings were exhibited. Soon, Shyam gained international recognition and his paintings were displayed in the art exhibitions of Japan, UK and US. He also played an important role in the formation of Bharat Bhawan, amuti art complex in Bhopal, established in 1982, and the collection of tribal art at its art museum. He wrote that: \\"cultural experiences and activity in India is a multi-level phenomenon ‚Äì and these levels are often mutually independent and non-interacting ‚Äì it is the urban and the so-called modern sense of contemporarity that appears to dominate the scene and thus to distort the real perspective\\". Likewise, Swaminathan pondered over the tribal culture and throughout his life he kept on addressing the people and tried to give the tribal expression a proper place in the global art and cultural fora. As an artist and a man of institutions he kept on guiding people from all walks of life who value culture and human endeavour in wider perspective. In 2007, an Untitled work by him was auction at the Christie's for $312,000. Bibliography * J. Swaminathan, by Krishen Khanna. Lalit Kala Akademi, 1995. * Transits of a Wholetimer: J.

The game takes place in dedicated MagiQuest locations. Players, called Magi in the game, use an infrared (IR) emitting wand to interact with objects. These objects are scattered throughout the MagiQuest locations. By waving and pointing the wand at an object, referred to as \\"casting\\" in game, a player \\"activates\\" an object. For example, pointing a wand at a treasure chest will cause the chest to open, awarding an amount of gold to a player's account. At some locations, there are optional items available for purchase, unlocking secret areas or allowing a player to go on additional quests. Completing these additional quests or exploring these secret areas allow for even more in-game items, adding additional content to the game.  History  The first MagiQuest opened in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina at noon on June 15, 2005. The opening celebration included live appearances by actors featured in the quests. Additional MagiQuest locations have subsequently opened in East Hanover, New Jersey and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Great Wolf Resorts made an agreement with Creative Kingdoms in 2008 to install the game at all current Great Wolf Lodge resorts. In 2010, MagiQuest opened in the County Fair Games Gallery at Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois. MagiQuest closed late-2010 and was removed from the park. On July 31, 2011, MagiQuest opened in Fun City at the Palisades Mall in West Nyack, New York. In Japan, there is a MagiQuest kingdom near Tokyo Dome. In December 2011 - January 2012, the first Canadian MagiQuest opened in a Great Wolf Lodge in Niagara Falls, ON. On September 7, 2015, the Myrtle Beach MagiQuest closed permanently. Other locations in West Nyack, New York and East Hanover, New Jersey were also permanently closed. The Myrtle Beach location was owned by Creative Kingdoms (owner and developer of MagiQuest's technology and associated patents). When the Myrtle Beach location closed it was owned by Great Wolf Resorts, who bought out Creative Kingdoms in 2010 to make it cheaper to install MagiQuest in their hotels. Other locations are franchised besides the ones in Great Wolf Lodges, though many have also closed due to them cutting off support making it difficult to manage operation post- takeover. = Related games = DinoQuest, a dinosaur-themed interactive game based on the same patented technologies is located in Santa Ana, CA. Announced at the IAAPA 2009 (International Association of Amusement Park and Attractions) trade show are plans for Creative Kingdoms (the parent company of MagiQuest) to create a spin-off company, 'AquaKingdoms' that will bring a new form of the technology used in MagiQuest to water based attractions. The first product of AquaKingdoms, SplashQuest, was introduced in prototype form to Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels, TX for the summer of 2009, though nothing else has come out of AquaKingdoms since the buyout. CompassQuest, a very similar game, can be found in some of the same locations as MagiQuest. It uses a compass as well as a wand, and there are no boss battles, unlike MagiQuest. At the Myrtle Beach location, after completing a Wayfinder Quest, the compass can activate stations to show you where items are for every quest and adventure in the game. At Great Wolf Lodge, in addition to the Wayfinder and Treasure Quests, it unlocks 7 other quests centered around certain lands (Piney Path, Tangled Woods, etc.). In Fall 2013, a new game called ShadowQuest (now known as Journey to Save the Light), the first of projects to be created by Great Wolf post buyout, began to appear at six of the MagiQuest locations at Great Wolf Lodge. In its early version, it used pre-rendered videos for quest intros and success videos. However, encounters are now rendered in real time, allowing for dueling spells to immediately take effect. When the Great Wolf Lodge in New England opened in 2014, it featured a new version of MagiQuest called \\"Guardians of the Realm Portals\\", with new characters, updated quest requirements, and different strategies/real-time rendering for the pixie, goblin, and dragon encounters. It would continue to use the same software as the older game until the lodge was upgraded. In early 2016, the California lodge opened with a beta version of the new \\"MagiQuest Chronicles\\" which included a new version of Guardians of the Realm Portals, where all of the computer graphics (both at encounters and quest stations) are rendered in real time, as well as Journey to Save the Light (formerly ShadowQuest), and Rise of the Totem Masters, a Skylanders-esque game where you level up a totem figure by battling dark creatures. After the creation of MagiQuest Chronicles the original version and platform of the old game was dubbed as \\"Legacy MagiQuest\\" and Chronicles has also been given the fan name of \\"MagiQuest 2.0\\". It has since been expanded to all new Great Wolf Lodges that have opened in the past few years and the Williamsburg, Virginia location was also converted from the original game to MagiQuest Chronicles. The MagiQuest fan community has been quite critical of Chronicles as its quite different from the original gameplay and spirit of legacy.  Gameplay  =The Ancient Book of Wisdom= At all MagiQuest locations opened prior to 2013, with the exception of the Williamsburg Great Wolf Lodge, players are provided with an \\"Ancient Book of Wisdom,\\" a booklet containing hints and riddles to help locate necessary object for completing quests, game directions, requirements for adventures (more advanced quests that require the use of certain spells obtained by completing quests), and a map of the location. The book's contents are unique to each location, much like how the quests and adventures are also unique to each location. The Book of Wisdom's ShadowQuest counterpart is called the ShadowQuest Guide. At the Williamsburg Great Wolf Lodge and all MagiQuest locations opened after 2014, in addition to a printout map of the game area, players also use the MagiQuest Book of Wisdom app on iPhone or Android. =Quests and adventures= The objective of MagiQuest is to build and gain power by obtaining magic runes. These runes are awarded for completing certain tasks, using the wand to activate targets marked with a stylised Q. The runes available on Rune Quests are: Lightning, Enchant Creature, Music, Protection, Freeze, Distraction, Healing, Portal, Dazzle, Reveal, Ice Arrow, and Master Magi. While the Master Magi Rune does not grant any spells like the other Runes, earning it opens up new Rune Quests specifically for Master Magi. These Runes are the Fire, Shield, and Potion Runes. The Celestial and Great Wolf Runes are also available at some Great Wolf Lodge locations. Outside of the kingdom of MagiQuest, a player can use their wand and the powers they have earned to duel each other for gold and experience points. At the Myrtle Beach location, Magi could also participate in \\"Garden Quest\\", a special rune that took Magi around Broadway at the Beach, an outdoor shopping mall in Myrtle Beach. =MagiQuest Online= MagiQuest Online (MQ Online) was an online version of the game created by Cyan Worlds, the creators of Myst. The game ran on the same engine used in Cyan's own online game, Myst Online: Uru Live (Plasma engine). MQ Online was sold in chapters; but only the first chapter was developed and available for gameplay. While the game had a free trial mode, each \\"chapter\\" had to be purchased individually per player account. Players who completed chapter one online were allowed to access an additional quest, the Silver Dragon, that could be played at selected MagiQuest and Great Wolf Lodge locations in the United States. On October 1, 2012 Creative Kingdoms announced it would discontinue MagiQuest Online on December 31, 2012. As of 2013, the game is no longer available, and the Silver Dragon quest was made available to all Master Magi who defeated Charlock, the red dragon. Technology of MagiQuest The MagiQuest wand is a battery-powered infrared (IR) remote control device with an LED at the tip. Motion sensors (a spring sensor and a ball-and-tube sensor) inside the wand detect movement and cause the LED to emit a brief series of flashes which is unique to that wand. These flashes can be seen by pointing the wand at the lens of any digital video camera in a dark room. The wand's range is several meters. There is no on/off switch; when the wand is left motionless, the circuit is not energized, saving battery power. The Compass Quest compass is a plastic housing containing an embedded RFID device that doesn't require battery power. Like the wand, every compass has a unique numeric code that is transmitted when in the range of a detector, approximately 1-2 centimeters (about 1 inch). No information is stored in either the wand or the compass. The player's name, birthday, and nickname are associated with the wand and/or compass ID number at the time of purchase. The exact names and date given are irrelevant. This association is stored in a central online database server, and can be transferred to a new wand if the original one is lost. The server tracks the current status (runes and gold acquired, current quest, etc.) of every player in the system. In-game objects contained embedded IR sensors, plus a set of RFID panels shaped like the outline of the compass. Game objects can include pictures on the walls, statues, ceiling tiles, animatronic chests, and video kiosks and projection rooms. Most stations have lights and audio prompts which play briefly on activation and shut off automatically, but kiosks and projection rooms additionally contain touchscreen video displays which allow the player to interact with the system for a short session; no login is required other than the presence of the wand or compass. Gameplay typically consists of using a kiosk to receive instructions for a quest or adventure, then finding and activating a series of game objects. The requirements for the initial quests are printed in an instruction booklet supplied with the wand, but some quests must be received from the kiosks and committed to memory. Informational kiosks throughout the complex can be used to find out what parts of the current quest have been completed and what is left to do, but these omit certain clues to the locations of the objects. The database is nationwide. The player's status (current quest, number of gold pieces, etc.) for every location can be queried from any informational kiosk in the network. Within a complex, it is updated continuously‚Äîfor instance, after activating one object, a time limit (e.g. 30 seconds) may be given to find and activate the next object in the series, and if the limit is exceeded by even a few seconds, the next object will instruct the player to return to the previous station. Content creation =Blackmore's Night= The band Blackmore's Night performs some of the music for MagiQuest. Candice Night, the band's vocalist, plays the role of Princess Candice. She also plays the role of Princess Amora, who is seen only at Great Wolf Lodge locations.  Wand accessories  There are several different replacement \\"orbs\\", known as \\"toppers\\", available for purchase. There is also a rune keeper on which to keep purchased rune replicas. The orb toppers relate to the specific clans that the player can join. While the toppers relate to the clans, the player, or Magi, can choose any topper he wishes. The Clans are: *Warrior (red)- Warriors' strength is in their bravery. Clan members have the power of dueling. They wield the power of lightning in their wand. Only the Man in the Mist can grant other Magi this power. *Woodsy (green)- Woodsy's strength is in their relationship with nature. Clan members can summon any naturalistic element or enchanted creatures to help them in their quest. This power of creature enchantment can only be granted to Magi of other clans by Serena the Pixie. *Trickster (purple)- Trickster's strength is in their magic. Clan members often use jokes, magic, or music to distract their opponents. Only Glittertail the unicorn can grant this musical power to Magi of other clans. *Shadow (black)- Shadow's strength is in their power and deceit. Shadow can disappear from a place on cue and easily distract their opponents.

Mandanipour was born and raised in Shiraz. In 1975 he moved to Tehran and studied Political Sciences at Tehran University, graduating in 1980. In 1981, he enlisted in the army for his military service. To experience war and to write about it, he volunteered to join the front during the Iran-Iraq war and served there as an officer for eighteen months. Following his military service, Mandanipour returned to Shiraz where he worked as director of the Hafiz Research Center and director of the National Library of Fars. In 1998, he became chief editor of Asr-e Panjshanbeh (Thursday Evening), a monthly literary journal. In 2006, Mandanipour traveled to the United States as an International Writers Project Fellow at Brown University. In 2007 and 2008 he was a writer in residence at Harvard University and in 2009 at Boston College. In September 2011, Mandanipour returned to Brown University as a visiting professor of literary arts where he currently teaches contemporary Persian literature and modern Iranian cinema. He is currently a Professor of the Practice at Tufts University. Works Mandanipour started writing at the age of fourteen and published his first short story, Shadows of the Cave, in 1985 in the literary journal Mofid Magazine. In 1989, his first collection of short stories was published under the same title. Regarded as one of the most accomplished and promising writers of contemporary Iranian literature, Mandanipour's creative approach to the use of symbols and metaphors, his inventive experimentation with language, time and space, as well as his unique awareness of sequence and identity have made his work fascinating to critics and readers alike. In his stories, Mandanipour creates his own unique surreal world in which illusion seems as real as terrifying reality. The nightmares and realisms of his stories are rooted in the historical horrors and sufferings of the people of Iran. At the outset, Mandanipour's stories are enigmatic, yet they jolt awake the reader's imagination and provoke him or her to peel away the intricately woven and fused layers in which past and present, and tradition and modernity collide. His characters do not conform to conventional molds. Traditional identities are blurred as the lines between right and wrong, friend and foe, sanity and insanity become fluid. Often driven by the most basic human instincts of fear, survival and loneliness, Mandanipour's characters struggle in a world of contradictions and ambiguities and grapple with self-identity, social dilemmas, and everyday life. In a collection of essays on creative writing, The Book of Shahrzad‚Äôs Ghosts (Ketab-e ArvƒÅh-e ShahrzƒÅd), Mandanipour discusses the elements of the story and the novel, as well as his theories on the nature of literature and the secrets of fiction. He writes, ‚ÄúLiterature is the alchemy of transforming reality into words and creating a new phenomenon called fictional reality.‚Äù His novel The Courage of Love (Del-e Del Dadegi), published in 1998, is structured around a love quadrangle with the four main characters representing earth, fire, water, and wind. Events in the novel take place during two different periods of war and earthquake. By placing the two timeframes laterally, like mirrors facing each other, Mandanipour compares the devastation, savagery, futility, and the dark consequences of war and earthquake. In the novel, Mandanipour employs stream of consciousness. Numerous critics, including Houshang Golshiri, have regarded the 900-page work of fiction as a masterpiece of contemporary Iranian literature. In 2008, he cooperated in the writing the screenplay of a documentary named Chahar Marge Yek Nevisandeh (Four Deaths of a Writer). It is the life of a writer showing how he dies four times in his works and the screenplay was directed by Ali Zare Ghanat Nowi. In 2009, Mandanipour published Censoring an Iranian Love Story, his first novel to be translated into English. Ostensibly a tale of romance, the book delves deeply into themes of censorship as the author struggles, in the text, with writing a love story that he'll be able to get past Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance's Office of Censorship. The novel is not only a love story, but it is also a story about the love of writing and an account of life in post-Islamic Revolution Iran. In the novel two narratives are intertwined. In one, we read of the difficulties, fears and trepidations that surround the meeting of a young couple in modern-day Iran at a time when gender separation is forcefully imposed on society. Scene by scene we become more familiar with the struggles they face in preserving their love and the creative schemes they contrive to lessen the risk of discovery and arrest. In a parallel storyline, Mandanipour enters as his own alter ego and takes us along as he composes each sentence and scene, revealing his frustrations and his methods of battling against censorship. The sentences that the writer self-censors appear as strikethroughs in the text. The writer's comical efforts at surmounting censorship and advancing his story resemble the struggles of the young lovers to preserve their love. Translated into English by Sara Khalili, Censoring an Iranian Love Story was well received by critics worldwide. The New Yorker named it one of the Reviewers‚Äô favorites from 2009, and National Public Radio listed it as one of The Best Debut Fictions of 2009. In his review for The New Yorker, James Wood wrote, ‚ÄúMandanipour‚Äôs writing is exuberant, bonhomous, clever, profuse with puns and literary-political references.\\"[2] For The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote, ‚ÄúSome of Mr. Mandanipour‚Äôs efforts to inject his story with surreal, postmodern elements feel distinctly strained (the intermittent appearances of a hunchbacked midget, in particular, are annoyingly gratuitous and contrived), but he‚Äôs managed, by the end of the book, to build a clever Rubik‚Äôs Cube of a story, while at the same time giving readers a haunting portrait of life in the Islamic Republic of Iran: arduous, demoralizing and constricted even before the brutalities of the current crackdown.‚Äù And writing in the Los Angeles Times, Susan Salter Reynolds commented, ‚ÄúCensorship, seen as its own art form, is just another way of messing with reality. It‚Äôs hard enough to generate one‚Äôs own ideas without having someone else‚Äôs superimposed over them, but the fictional Mandanipour tries ‚Ä¶ He writes a love story that is convincingly, achingly impossible in a place where men and women cannot even look at each other in public. The effect (as every good Victorian understood) is deliriously sensual prose.‚Äù Awards In 1994, Mandanipour was named Best Film Critique at the Press Festival in Tehran. In 1998, he received the Golden Tablet Award for best fiction of the past 20 years in Iran. In 2004, he won the Mehregan Award for the best Iranian children's novel. In 2010, he was awarded The Athens Prize for Literature for his novel Censoring an Iranian Love Story. Bibliography * Censoring an Iranian Love Story, Alfred A. Knopf, Random House, 2009.

The song The deeply emotional lyrics and the sorrowful and heroic score, usually sung a cappella by a male choir, turned the song into a symbol of Asturian coal mining and of mining in general. Sometimes used as a working class anthem, the hymn was widely used during the Asturian miners uprising of 1934 and during the Spanish Civil War. The lyrics (usually sung in Asturian, Spanish or a mixture between both languages) describe the painful returning home of a miner, covered in the blood of his fellow miners, who tells his wife (Maruxina) of a mining accident in the famous Asturian mine known as Pozu Maria Luisa (located in Cia√±u, Langreo). Coal mining, which is present in Asturias since the 18th century having a pivotal role in the historical economic activity of the region, is known as a very dangerous activity. Historically, hundreds of miners have died in the mines of Asturias and deadly mining accidents were sadly common in the miner population. Santa B√°rbara is nowadays considered to be an important piece of Asturian traditional music and is included prominently in the Asturian folk music repertoire. The song is also often used in funerals, tributes and memorials.

Early life Sam Cookson was born in Manchester in 1896. He began his footballing career playing for Stalybridge Celtic. During weekdays Cookson was a miner and worked down a pit. At the weekends he played football 'purely for enjoyment'. p46 The mine work endowed Cookson with a powerful physique 'which sometimes proved deceptive to opposition forwards'. He subsequently played for Macclesfield Town before joining Manchester City. Manchester City In 1919 he signed for Manchester City whom he would play for until 1927, making 285 appearances for the team in the League and 306 appearances overall. His only goal for the Manchester team came in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Corinthian in the 1925‚Äì1926 FA Cup. Cookson is often described as one of the best uncapped full backs of his generation. p28 He formed a long-lasting defensive partnership with Eli Fletcher at City. His first team debut occurred in a 1‚Äì0 win over Bradford City in December 1919. Tommy Browell scored City's only goal in that game. That season City finished seventh in the first division with 45 points. In the 1920‚Äì21 football season, Cookson made 42 appearances for Manchester City who came second in the league, 5 points behind champions Burnley, which was City's highest position in the league since the 1903‚Äì04 football season when City had a team which included Billie Gillespie, Frank Booth and Billy Meredith. The following season, the 1921‚Äì22 football season, Billy Meredith returned to Manchester City and played alongside Cookson on the right side of the City team. Cookson made 39 league appearances for Manchester City that season and City finished tenth in the league with 45 points. In the 1922‚Äì23 football season the City team was further enhanced by the acquisition of Frank Roberts from Bolton Wanderers. He joined a City attack which also included Horace Barnes and Tommy Johnson. The team finished eighth in the league, again with 45 points. In the 1923‚Äì24 football season Manchester City moved to a new ground, Maine Road, and Horace Barnes scored the first goal at the new stadium in a 2‚Äì1 victory against Sheffield United on the opening day of the season. The team ultimately finished eleventh in the league on 42 points. Cookson played in all of City's 8 games in the FA Cup that season. The team were ultimately defeated in the semi final by Newcastle United by two goals to nil. In the following season City's defence was enhanced by the acquisition of Sam Cowan from Doncaster Rovers. Cookson made 37 appearances for City that season and the team finished in tenth place with 43 points. In the 1925‚Äì26 football season, Cookson was part of the Manchester City team which were relegated to the second division. Cookson would never appear in the first division again. Cookson also played for City in the FA Cup Final that season against Bolton Wanderers, but finished on the losing side. England international David Jack scored the only goal of the game. In the 1926‚Äì27 football season, City finished third in the second division, 8 points behind winners Middlesbrough. His final appearance for the Manchester club came in the 1927‚Äì28 football season in which the team won promotion to the first division. Later career Cookson subsequently played for Barnsley, whom City purchased Eric Brook and Fred Tilson from. Despite a long and distinguished career, the only honour that Cookson won was gained at the age of 39, a Third Division North title with Barnsley. His brother Jimmy also played for Manchester City, where he did not make the first team, and later played for Chesterfield and West Bromwich Albion. Legacy Cookson is regarded as one of Manchester City's greatest ever players. In 1977 the Manchester City Council named eleven streets in a new estate in Moss Side after famous City players including Cookson, Frank Swift, Fred Tilson, Sam Cowan, Horace Barnes, Max Woosnam, Tommy Browell, Jimmy McMullan, Eric Brook, Billy Meredith and Tommy Johnson. p75 He is listed as the forty-ninth greatest ever City player in Ian Penney's book The Essential History of Manchester City. p188 References Category:1896 births Category:English footballers Category:Footballers from Manchester Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Year of death unknown Category:Stalybridge Celtic F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football fullbacks ","title":"Sam Cookson (English footballer)"},{"id":"9857815","text":"Buenos Aires Sings (Spanish:Buenos Aires canta) is a 1947 Argentine musical film directed by Antonio Solano and starring Nin√≠ Marshall, Hugo del Carril and Azucena Maizani.Etchelet p.351 The film is part of the tradition of tango films.

The \\"Holte End\\" stand of Villa Park, the stadium of Aston Villa Football Club, sits on land originally part of the Aston Hall gardens and is named after Thomas Holte. Biography He was born the son of Edward Holte of the Manor House, Duddeston, Warwickshire by his wife Dorothy Ferrars. The Holtes were a wealthy, land- owning family of some importance in Warwickshire. Their ancestors had owned land in the area for several hundred years and it had been considerably added to with the acquisition of monastic land during the Reformation. The Holtes served as High Sheriff of Warwickshire, Justices of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenants for the county. They had influential friends and relatives both locally and in London. His father died when Thomas was only 21, and as his successor Thomas did much to further the family fortunes. Aston Hall, built by Sir Thomas Holte, 1st Baronet In 1599 he himself served as High Sheriff of Warwickshire. He received a knighthood in 1603 from James I as the King made his way from Scotland to London to claim his throne. In 1612 Sir Thomas was able to buy the title of baronet (James I sold these new titles in order to raise money to quell trouble in Ireland). Sir Thomas now outranked all the local families and felt a grander home should be built to reflect both his wealth and status. The result of this desire was Aston Hall which he started building in 1618 and moved into in 1631. On 18 October 1642 King Charles I stayed the night at Aston Hall on his way to London. On his way to London he came across the Parliamentary Forces and the Battle of Edgehill was fought on 23 October. In December 1643, during the English Civil War, Sir Thomas requested the Hall be garrisoned by troops from Dudley Castle. Forty musketeers were sent by Colonel Leveson to protect Aston Hall but shortly after their arrival they had to defend the hall against a 1200-strong force of Parliamentary soldiers sent from Coventry and local militia from Birmingham. Marriages and children Monument in St Cassian's Church, Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire, to Elizabeth Holte (d.1647), unmarried daughter of Sir Thomas Holte, 1st Baronet He married twice: *Firstly to Grace Bradbourne, a daughter and co-heiress of William Bradbourne of Hough, Derbyshire, by whom he had fifteen children, most of whom died young. His surviving children included: **George Holte (d.1641), eldest son and heir apparent, who predeceased his father; **Edward Holte (d.1643), second son, who predeceased his father. His father secured for him a position in the household of King Charles I. Whilst in London Edward met and married Elizabeth King, daughter of John King, Bishop of London, by his wife Joan Freeman. Sir Thomas did not give his permission for the marriage, and never forgave his son for proceeding regardless. Edward was entirely cut off from his inheritance, and despite pleas from the king himself, Sir Thomas never allowed reconciliation. After the death of his eldest brother George in 1641, Edward was his father's only surviving son. He died on military service in 1643, having never returned to the family fold despite his several attempts. **Grace Holte (d.1677), who married firstly Sir Richard Shuckburgh, by whom she had a son Sir John Shuckburgh, 1st Baronet (1635‚Äì1661); secondly she married Sir John Keating, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. She died in Dublin in 1677 and her second husband erected a memorial to her in Palmerstown Church. **Elizabeth Holte (d.1647), unmarried, to whom her father erected an elaborate monument in St Cassian's Church, Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire. *Secondly he married Anne Littleton, the youngest daughter of Sir Edward Littleton, 1st Baronet of Pillaton Hall, Staffordshire, by his wife Hester Courten. He made great efforts to father another son, so that Edward could be permanently cut out of the estate. It was rumoured that Sir Thomas locked up a daughter because she refused to marry her father's choice of husband. The story goes that she starved to death. Many other stories were told of his violent rages: the best known, but probably untrue story was that he murdered his cook with a meat cleaver (or according to another version, with a roasting spit). Anne Littleton was able to give him another son, but the boy did not survive past childhood, in common with nine of the children from Sir Thomas' first marriage. Anne Littleton survived him and remarried to Charles Leigh, younger son of Thomas Leigh, 1st Baron Leigh. Death and burial During his last days he was finally persuaded to bequeath Aston Hall and all his estates to his grandson Robert Holte, Edwards's son, who inherited the baronetcy. Sir Thomas was buried in Aston Church, survived only by his wife Anne Littleton and his daughter Grace.

History  Temple Emanu-El of Dallas was founded in 1873 and chartered in 1875. Originally called the Jewish Congregation Emanu-El, it was renamed Temple Emanu-El Congregation in 1974. The small but growing Jewish community felt the need for a permanent religious structure as well as for a rabbi to conduct services and to offer religious education for children, so several families formed Congregation Emanu-El. They elected David Goslin president; Philip Sanger vice president; Emanuel Tillman treasurer; H. Regensburger secretary; and Alexander Sanger, August Israelsky, and Henry Loeb trustees. The next year they built a small red brick temple in the Byzantine style at Commerce and Church (now Field) streets in downtown Dallas. The congregation engaged its first rabbi, Aaron Suhler, in 1875 and joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1906. In 1957 the temple moved to its present location in north Dallas. Architects Howard R. Meyer and Max M. Sandfield, with noted California architect William Wurster as consultant, received an Award of Merit from the American Institute of Architects for the design of the present structure, which was enhanced by art coordinator Gy√∂rgy Kepes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Notable rabbis at the temple were David Lefkowitz (1920‚Äì49) and Levi A. Olan (1949‚Äì72). Notable members have included Hattie Leah Henenberg.  Locations  Temple Emanu-El has had four locations in its history: *Commerce Street (1876‚Äì1898) *Ervay Street (1899‚Äì1917) *South Boulevard (1917‚Äì1956) *Hillcrest Road (1957‚Äìpresent)  Core values  According to Temple Emanu-El's website, \\"Temple Emanu-El is a vibrant Reform Jewish community that strives to be a place of sacred encounter. It is a place where learning, prayer and deeds change people's understanding of themselves, of their world and their responsibilities in it.\\"  Clergy  The current members of the Temple Emanu-El clergy are: *Rabbi David E. Stern (Senior Rabbi) *Rabbi Debra J. Robbins *Rabbi Kimberly Herzog Cohen *Rabbi Daniel Utley *Rabbi Amy Ross (educator) *Cantor Vicky Glikin (Senior Cantor) *Cantor Leslie Niren Past Temple Emanu-El senior rabbis include:A Light in the Prairie, Gerry Cristol, TCU Press (1998) *Rabbi Joseph Silverman (1884‚Äì1885) * Rabbi George Alexander Kohut (1897‚Äì1900) *Rabbi William Greenburg *Rabbi David Lefkowitz (1920‚Äì1949) *Rabbi Levi Olan (1948‚Äì1970) *Rabbi Gerald J.

It was shown at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival, where it also won for Best Cinematography. The film was part of an ultimately failed effort by the producer Luis Guillermo Villegas Blanco to establish a Venezuelan film industry during the era. Despite this, it is seen as marking the \\"true birth of Venezuelan cinema\\". For the film, Blanco brought in established film personnel and actors from Argentina and Mexico. It was shot on location and at the Bolivar Studios in Caracas.Rist p.65 Synopsis The captain of a small vessel regularly sailing between his home island of Margarita Island in the Caribbean and the Venezuelan mainland has two separate and very different relationships. At home he is happily married, having named his boat Isabel after his wife. He also has a young son Juan who aspires to become his father's cabin boy. Yet on his visits to the port of La Guaira he has a passionate affair with Esperanza, a woman working in a seedy cabaret. Having decided to give up his mistress, even considering selling his boat so that he can no longer visit her, she arranges to have a voodoo spell placed on him which sends him into an obsessive trance. Only through the intervention of his son, and a violent confrontation, is he finally able to break free from her control.

The associate producers were Enrique Faustin and Christensen. Christensen was also chosen by the Venezuelan production to be director;Aguilar & Ortiz p.2 Aguilar and Ortiz suggest that he was chosen to direct in large part because of his \\"audacity [...] when he introduced eroticism in the Argentine melodrama, especially in Safo, historia de una pasi√≥n\\".Aguilar & Ortiz p.3 Filming locations include Caracas, Margarita, Costa de Barlovento, and Muchinga de la Guaira. The neighborhood of Muchinga had been abandoned shortly before the film was made, seen as a place of destitution, but was in part rebuilt for the film, with El Nacional reporting at the time that dozens of tradesmen were deployed to the coast. Actor Arturo de C√≥rdova both visited this area and moved to Margarita, living among the fishermen for several months to get into character. The music used in the film, under direction and composition of the Venezuelan Eduardo Serrano, reflects the traditional music of the locations in the film and incorporates Afro-Venezuelan music. Serrano had minimal experience with music for film. Within the music department was Leopoldo Orzali, who had worked with Christensen on films before. The story of the film is based on the novel of the same name written by Guillermo Meneses, and is described as a political narrative that intends to break traditional regionalism.Aguilar & Ortiz p.4 References Bibliography   External links  * Category:1949 films Category:Venezuelan films Category:Argentine films Category:Spanish- language films Category:Films directed by Carlos Hugo Christensen Category:Argentine black-and-white films Category:Venezuelan black-and-white films Category:Seafaring films Category:Films set in the Caribbean Category:Films set in Venezuela Category:Films shot in Venezuela Category:1949 drama films Category:Venezuelan drama films Category:Argentine drama films ","title":"The Yacht Isabel Arrived This Afternoon"},{"id":"9857951","text":"\\"Los Angelenos\\" is a song written by Billy Joel that was first released on his 1974 album Streetlife Serenade. A live version was released on the 1981 album Songs in the Attic. Lyrics and music The Long Island-raised Joel wrote the song while living in Los Angeles, California, reflecting his impressions of the city. Authors Don and Jeff Breithaupt suggest that the song reflects the \\"Left Coast displacement\\" he was feeling at the time. Joel biographer Hank Bordowitz similarly describes \\"Los Angelenos\\" as showing \\"that Billy was beginning to feel a bit homesick.\\" The lyrics to \\"Los Angelenos\\" celebrate the diversity of Los Angeles. They observe that the inhabitants of Los Angeles mostly have come from elsewhere, many far from California. They are searching for something that caused them to come to Los Angeles, but many get seduced by the nice weather and the availability of sex and drugs, and so remain even if they cannot find what they originally came for. Joel notes that these people are \\"goin' nowhere.\\" Author Ken Bielen describes the song as having a \\"funky rock beat.\\" Joel biographer Fred Schruers describes it as having \\"hip-swinging rhythms.\\" Music critic Mark Bego states that the song \\"rocks out\\" more intensely than any of Joel's work since he was with The Hassles in the 1960s. Bielen describes the melody as being similar to that of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Fire,\\" which was written shortly after \\"Los Angelenos.\\" Joel's electric piano is prominent in the mix. Critical reception Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the \\"stomping 'Los Anegelenos'\\" as one of the \\"few winners\\" from the Streetlife Serenade album. Schruers describes it as Joel's \\"best attempt to sketch a portrait of\\" Los Angeles. Bego states that song \\"essays [Joel's] life in the West Coast beautifully, with a critical eye.\\" But Bordowitz says it has \\"a cynical quality.\\" And Rolling Stone critic Stephen Holden states that it \\"presents a hackneyed picture postcard of L.A. as sexual wasteland.\\" Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Paul Evans states that it is one of several \\"narrative vignettes\\" on Streetlife Serenade that \\"strain[s] to be clever.\\" Billboard regarded it as one of the \\"best cuts\\" from Steetlife Serenade. Live version A live version of \\"Los Angelenos\\" recorded in July 1980 at Toad's Place in New Haven, Connecticut, was included on the 1981 live album Songs in the Attic. Erlewine states that the \\"fuller, better arrangement\\" makes the live version \\"hit harder\\" than the studio version. A 16 mm black-and-white promotional video was made of \\"Los Angelenos\\" being performed live at a small club in support of Songs in the Attic. A promotional single was released in Japan.

It is the first volume of The Edge Chronicles and of the Twig Saga trilogy; within the stories' own chronology it is the fourth novel, following the Quint Saga trilogy that was published later. Plot Raised by woodtrolls in the Deepwoods all his life, Twig believes he is one of them, yet strongly suspects there is something different about him, as he does not fit in with them; in particular, he feels a longing to live as a sky pirate. He sets off to find his true kind when he learns from his adoptive woodtroll mother that he is not a woodtroll after all, but was found abandoned in the woods and taken in by them. His adoptive mother tells him to travel to their cousin's house to mull things over, but during Twig's journey through the Deepwoods, he ends up unintentionally straying from the path. This is an act no woodtroll ever commits, for the woodtrolls' greatest fear is getting lost, and this fear is not without reason. The forest is populated with both fierce natural predators and evil demons, the most dangerous being the Gloamglozer. Twig soon stumbles upon a slaughterer who is being attacked by a hover worm. Twig kills the hover worm and the grateful slaughterer invites him to spend the night in his village. The next morning, Twig is woken by a slaughterer who tells him that he has outstayed his welcome, and is expected to leave immediately, which he does. Twig has a run- in with a skullpelt, a predator which hunts people who fall under the illusions of the Deepwoods' lullabee trees, but is saved by a caterbird which has just hatched from its cocoon. As all caterbirds share telepathic dreams whilst in the womb, and the oakelf sage of Twig's woodtroll village lived in a caterbird cocoon, this caterbird knows all about Twig. The caterbird tells Twig his destiny lies \\"beyond the Deepwoods\\" and flies off, promising to return when he is in danger. That night, Twig is almost eaten by a bloodoak, a man-eating tree, but escapes and ends up in a gyle goblin colony, where he is almost fed to the goblins by their leader, the Grossmother. After a gyle goblin guides him to safety, Twig meets an injured banderbear, one of the forest's dominant predators. The banderbear is sick because of a rotten tooth, which Twig pulls out. Soon, Twig and the banderbear become great friends, but one day the banderbear is killed by a swarm of wig-wigs, ferocious predators which act like piranhas. Later, Twig almost drowns in a swamp, but is rescued by a flathead goblin who vanishes before Twig can thank him. Twig meets a young girl who takes him as a \\"pet\\" in the underground society of the termagant trogs. Twig spends a few months with the trog girl, but eventually she undergoes the termagant trogs' maturation ceremony by drinking sap from a bloodoak root, turning her into a monstrous brute like the other adult female trogs. However, a lone trog male saves Twig, much to his surprise, and directs him to the exit. Twig finally meets some sky pirates, whose ship has crashed due to the flight-rock which powers the ship falling out of the sky when it was struck by lightning, and helps them repair it. When their captain Cloud Wolf, whose real name is Quintinius Verginix, tells a story about his past, Twig realizes that Quintinius is his true father, and wants to join his crew. To Twig's horror, though, the next morning he awakens alone, abandoned by his father again. Distraught, Twig realizes the pirates' campfire has started a forest fire. Twig runs for his life and ends up in the Edgelands on the outskirts of the Deepwoods, where he meets the Gloamglozer face to face. The Gloamglozer tempts Twig into living a life as a Gloamglozer himself, having failed to fit in anywhere else, and reveals that he had been influencing Twig's journey all along in the guise of a slaughterer, gyle goblin, male trog and flathead goblin. However, when Twig agrees, the Gloamglozer instead throws him off the side of the Edge. The caterbird returns and rescues Twig before dropping him onto the deck of Quintinius Verginix's ship. Finally reunited with his true father, who apologizes for leaving him and promises to always protect him, Twig and the sky pirates set sail.

He was founder of the Orphan Homes of Scotland in Renfrewshire, which later evolved into the social care charity Quarriers. Life Quarrier was born in Greenock on 29 September 1829, but moved to Glasgow aged three following the death of his father and spent most of his childhood in poverty.http://www.quarriers.org.uk/about/history/williamquarrier.php Quarriers, \\"William Quarrier\\", retrieved 11 September 2008 Reflecting on his charitable acts in 1872, he accredited his philanthropy largely to these experiences: ::: \\"When a little boy, I stood in the High Street of Glasgow, barefoot, bareheaded, cold and hungry, having tasted no food for a day and a half, and, as I gazed at each passer-by, wondering why they did not help such as I, a thought passed through my mind that I would not do as they when I would get the means to help others\\"Quarriers annual Narrative of Facts for 1872 At 17 he began work as a shoemaker after training as an apprentice. At this stage, he became a devout Christian. Quarrier attended Blackfriars Street Church and later Adelaide Place Baptist Church, where he served as a deacon. https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/11871056/yuille-history-of-the- baptists-in-scotland-landmark-baptist, George Yuille \\"History of the Baptists in Scotland\\", 1926, p.171 He soon owned a chain of shops and married Isabella Hunter, the daughter of his first employer. Quarrier fathered four children: Isabella, Agnes, Frank and Mary Quarrier. Charitable work Quarrier is best known for his charitable work. In 1871 he opened a night refuge for homeless children in Renfrew Street, Glasgow. Then in 1876, using charitable donations, Quarrier began to build the Orphan Homes of Scotland on a piece of land now in Inverclyde and between the villages of Kilmacolm and Bridge of Weir, falling within the civil parish of the former. By the 1890s 'Quarrier's Village', as it is now known, was home to 34 cottages, a school, a church and a fire station. The village was home to up to 1,500 children at a time. Children in need could be housed in conditions close to a home environment. Each cottage housed up to thirty children under the care of a \\"father and mother\\". Children were taught self-reliance and were well educated in the village school. Child migration From 1870 to 1936 the Orphan Homes of Scotland founded by William Quarrier participated in the British child relocation program sending more than 7,000 young people to Canada where they were employed, as farm labourers. Death and legacy William Quarrier died on 16 October 1903. He is buried alongside his wife in the Mount Zion Church cemetery at Quarrier's Village. His work continues through the social care charity Quarriers, which is still based at Quarriers Village.

The ECP is supposed to be a universal syntactic constraint that requires certain types of empty categories, namely traces, to be properly governed. ECP is a principle of transformational grammar by which traces must be visible, i.e. they must be identifiable as empty positions in the surface structure, similar to the principle of reconstruction for deletion. Thus an empty category is in a position subcategorized for by a verb. In government and binding theory this is known as proper government. Proper government occurs either if the empty position is governed by a lexical category (especially if it is not a subject) (theta-government) or if it is coindexed with a maximal projection which governs it (antecedent-government). The ECP has been revised many times and is now a central part of government and binding theory.Hadumod Bussmann, Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics In spite of its name, the ECP applies to only two of the four types of null DPs. Specifically, it applies to DP- and Wh-traces, but not PRO and pro. The chief function of the ECP is to place constraints on the movement of categories by the rule of move Œ±; it effectively allows a tree structure to \\"remember\\" what has happened at earlier stages of a derivation, and it can be seen as GB's version of the older derivational constraints.R. L. Trask, A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics Formally, the ECP states that: *Traces must be properly governed: **A properly governs B iff A theta-governs B or A antecedent-governs B ***A theta-governs B iff A governs B and A theta-marks B ***A antecedent-governs B iff A governs B and A is coindexed with B.Silvia Luraghi and Claudia Parodi, Key Terms in Syntax and Syntactic Theory The ECP is a way of accounting for, among other things, the empirical fact that it is generally more difficult to move up a wh-word from a subject position than from an object position. The intermediate traces must be deleted because they cannot be properly governed; theta-government is impossible because of the position they occupy, Spec-CP; the only possible antecedent-governor might be an overt NP (a wh-word), but the Minimality Condition would always be violated because of the tensed I (which must be present in all matrix clauses), the tensed I would c-command the intermediate trace but it would not c-command the wh-word. So we have to say that intermediate traces must be deleted at logical form so that they can avoid the ECP. In the case of object extraction (the trace is a complement of VP), theta-government is the only possible option. In the case of subject extraction (the trace in Spec-IP), antecedent-government is the only possible option. If the trace is in Spec-IP and we have an overt complementizer (such as that), the sentence is ungrammatical because the ECP is violated. The closest potential governor would be the complementizer, which cannot antecedent-govern the trace because it is not coindexed with it (and theta- government is impossible since trace is in Spec-IP). For example, in the sentence Who do you think (that) John will invite? the ECP works in the following way (the structure is given for the embedded clause only): Image:ECPst.jpg See also *Wh-movement References Further reading * *Berjaoui, N.

The following month, Germ√°n Gelpi began to design the sets and Carlos Rinaldi was hired as director. The shooting of the film between July 1948 and January 1949 was long and arduous, during which the director of photography Francis Boeniger had to retire to fulfill other commitments and was replaced by Humberto Peruzzi, a collaborator who had been present from the founding of the production company. According to the critic C√©sar Maranghello, Lucas Demare, who was one of the partners of Artistas Argentinos Asociados, actively participated in the direction of the film.

Its area is , which makes it the second largest lake in Germany (after Lake Constance) and the largest lake located entirely within German territory. Its maximum depth is . It is fed and drained by the river Elde. Part of the M√ºritz and adjacent forests and wetlands are protected by the M√ºritz National Park. The former M√ºritz district was named after the lake. The biggest towns bordering the lake are Waren (M√ºritz) and R√∂bel, both major centres of tourism in the Mecklenburg Lake District. Lake M√ºritz is part of the M√ºritz-Elde Waterway, a Class I federal waterway.Verzeichnis E, Lfd. Nr. 35 der Chronik , Wasser- und Schifffahrtsverwaltung des Bundes It is managed by the Lauenburg Waterway and Shipping Authority (Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt Lauenburg).  Geography  Lake M√ºritz in R√∂bel = Divisions = The M√ºritz Basin is divided into several large bays. Unlike the shallow eastern part of the lake, the western side is divided into several channel-like inlets like the Bays of R√∂bel and Sietow (R√∂beler Bucht and Sietower Bucht). By the town of Waren on the northern shore of the lake is the Binnenm√ºritz, which contains the deepest point of the lake (‚àí31 metres), and only has a narrow strait connecting it to the main basin of Lake M√ºritz. At the southern shore is the Little M√ºritz (Kleine M√ºritz) from which the M√ºritzarm and the M√ºritzsee branch off further to the south. Lake M√ºritz measures about from north to south and about from east to west; and has a catchment area of about . The M√ºritz is crossed by the River Elde from south to north and has a link to the K√∂lpinsee in the west from the Binnenm√ºritz via the Reeck Canal (also Eldenburg Canal) which is a good two kilometres long. Because it also feeds the River Havel to the east via the Mirow Canal, which is part of the M√ºritz- Havel Waterway, and the Bolter Canal as well as via the chains of adjoining lakes, it has artificially been turned into a bifurcated waterway. Waren's town harbour = Creation = Lake M√ºritz was formed during the Weichselian glaciation between the Pomeranian and the Frankfurt Stages. Originally the entire Mecklenburg Lake District was a huge lake, that split into several smaller lakes, linked to one another, as a result of a fall in sea level. = Water level = The water level of Lake M√ºritz has changed several times in the preceding centuries, primarily as a result of human influences. In the 12th century the surface of the lake was still above sea level. By 1737 the lake surface had risen to as a result of the waterway being impounded in several positive and negative stages in order, for example, to drive mills along the River Elde downstream. But by 1739 the mill reservoir had been lowered by around . In the wake of two adjustments to the Elde and two further changes to the mill impoundment the water level reached its present level of in 1836.Fred Ruchh√∂ft: Der Wasserstand der ‚ÄûOberen Seen‚Äú in Mecklenburg in Mittelalter und fr√ºher Neuzeit in: Arch√§ologische Berichte aus Mecklenburg- Vorpommern, Vol. 6, 1999 Boathouses in front of R√∂bel = Settlements = The largest town on Lake M√ºritz is Waren (M√ºritz).

He served as a U.S. Representative for one term, prior to which he served as Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives. Biography Smith was born in Barre, Massachusetts to Deacon Samuel Smith and Patience Gregory Smith. His family moved to St. Albans in 1800, and he attended the common schools. Smith later studied law, first with his brother in law Roswell Hutchins, and later with Benjamin Swift. He was admitted to the bar in 1810 and began the practice of law in St. Albans as Swift's partner. He was State's Attorney for Franklin County from 1826 until 1832. Smith was a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1827 until 1837, and served as Speaker from 1831 until 1833. He was elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-sixth Congress, serving from March 4, 1839 until March 3, 1841. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1840 to the Twenty-seventh Congress. While in Congress, Smith delivered the speech, \\"\\"The Defense of the Independent Treasury Idea\\", which gained national attention and was considered one of the best speeches on this subject. Smith received an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University of Vermont. After leaving Congress, Smith became involved in railroad enterprises and helped establish the Vermont and Canada Railroad. Family John Smith married Maria Waitstill Curtis in 1814. Their children included Harriet Maria, J. Gregory, Edward Curtis, Worthington Curtis, Julia Pierpont, Francis Curtis, and Louisa Ten Broeck. He was the grandfather of Edward Curtis Smith. In addition, his family was related by marriage to those of Lawrence Brainerd, Amaziah Bailey James and F. Stewart Stranahan. Smith was also the great-great-grandfather of William Scranton, who served as Governor of and a Congressman from Pennsylvania. The genealogical line runs from John Smith (great-great- grandfather) to Worthington C.

It has a double-stranded DNA genome that is 123,500 base pairs in length with 143 ORFs. The virus forms small bodies called granules containing a single virion. CpGV is a virus of invertebrates ‚Äì specifically Cydia pomonella, commonly known as the Codling moth. CpGV is highly pathogenic, it is known as a fast GV ‚Äì that is, one that will kill its host in the same instar as infection; thus, it is frequently used as a biological pesticide. In pest control C. pomonella has proved to be a problematic pest on several fruit trees, including apples and pears. The caterpillars burrow into the fruit, rendering it unfit for sale. Traditional insecticides are of limited use, as some strains have acquired resistance to several insecticides. CpGV has been shown to kill many of the larvae of C. pomonella in trials without having adverse effects on humans or other animals, thanks to the specific nature of the virus. Also, no development of resistance was observed. The first CpGV strain, isolated in Mexico, has been commercially formulated into biological pesticides such as Madex (Andermatt Biocontrol AG), Carpovirusine (NPP/Arysta LifeScience) and Cyd-X (Certis). Due to the continued use of CpGV in the field, populations resistant to the Mexican strain of C. pomonella have been identified. New strains which are able to manage resistant codling moth populations have been developed. These strains are commercialized by BioTEPP inc. into Virosoft CP4, NPP/Arysta LifeScience into Carpovirusine Evo 2 and by Andermatt Biocontrol AG into Madex Max and Madex Plus.

In January 2016 she became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, having formerly served as the Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of St Andrews, and as the executive dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. Early life and education Richardson grew up in Tramore, County Waterford, one of seven children of Arthur and Julie Richardson.\\"Honorary Fellow: Dr Louise Richardson\\". Waterford Institute of Technology; retrieved 28 May 2015. After attending primary school at The Star of the Sea convent girls' school in Tramore, and St Angela's Secondary School, Ursuline Convent, Waterford, she studied at Trinity College, Dublin, where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in History, promoted in the usual way to a Master of Arts degree in 1982. In 1977, she received a Rotary Scholarship to study at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). She took an MA degree in Political Science from UCLA in 1981, followed by a move to Harvard, where she received a Master of Arts degree in Government in 1984 and a PhD in 1989 on government, relating specifically to the Falklands War and Suez Crisis. Career From 1989 to 2001 Richardson served as an assistant professor and then an associate professor in the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. During this period she also served for eight years as Head Tutor and Chair of the Board of Tutors (Director of Undergraduate Studies) in the School of Government Department. Richardson continued to serve in numerous administrative capacities at Harvard, including the Faculty Council and various committees concerned with undergraduate education, the status of women, and human rights. In July 2001, she was appointed executive dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Richardson's academic focus has been on international security with an emphasis on terrorist movements. She taught Harvard's large undergraduate lecture course, Terrorist Movements in International Relations, for which she won the Levenson Prize, awarded by the undergraduate student body to the best teachers at the University. This class, along with a number of graduate courses on terrorist movements and European terrorism, were for many years the only courses offered on the subject at Harvard. In addition to the Levenson Prize, Professor Richardson has received teaching awards from the American Political Science Association and Pi Sigma Alpha for outstanding teaching in political science; the Abramson Award in recognition of her \\"excellence and sensitivity in teaching undergraduates\\" and many awards from the Bok Center for Teaching Excellence. After her 2001 Radcliffe appointment, she continued to teach, both at Harvard College and Harvard Law School. In 2009, Richardson was appointed Principal of the University of St Andrews, succeeding Brian Lang. Her installation took place on 25 March 2009. She is the first woman, as well as the first Roman Catholic in modern times, to occupy the position. She was appointed Professor of International Relations at St Andrews in November 2010. Unlike previous principals, Richardson was not granted honorary membership to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which was all-male. Richardson spoke out about how the membership policies interfered with fundraising and the values of the university. In 2014, just before the referendum on Scottish independence, it was revealed that Richardson had resisted pressure by then First Minister Alex Salmond to tone down her comments on the impact of Scottish independence on research universities, and resisted pressure from an aide to Salmond to issue a statement praising the SNP government. On 28 May 2015, the University of Oxford announced that Professor Richardson had been nominated as the next Vice-Chancellor, subject to approval, to take up the post on 1 January 2016. The nomination was approved on 25 June 2015, and Richardson became the University's first female Vice-Chancellor in January 2016. She is also an Honorary Fellow at Kellogg College, Oxford. In October 2017, Richardson claimed that Oxford University was in need of reform, stating that the current system gives rise to \\"a waste of resources\\" and a \\"duplication of bureaucracy\\".https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/10/10/oxford- universitys-college-system-need-reform-vice-chancellor At her annual Oration, she stated, \\"We all know that change occurs slowly at Oxford‚Ä¶but the world is changing rapidly around us, and I believe that if we stand still we will enter a period of slow but definite decline.\\" In late February 2018, the University of Oxford's support for cuts to the national lecturers' pension scheme triggered a 14-day strike. A resolution to revert the decision was spearheaded by six Oxford academics, including Dr. Karma Nabulsi and Prof. Robert Gildea. On Tuesday, 6 March 2018, Richardson used a technicality to upend a debate on the plans. At a meeting of Congregation, the governing body of Oxford, 20 members and supporters of Richardson stood up as the resolution was introduced, thereby blocking the debate. Academics then held an unofficial vote outside, which delivered a result of 442 for and 2 against. Richardson herself stated that she had been absent at the event due to having \\"scheduled a trip to New York\\". An initial offer on her part for a non-binding \\"town hall discussion\\" as a replacement for the debate was rejected. The following day, Richardson sent out an email to staff in which she stated that \\"In the light of the depth of feeling of so many colleagues, we will convene a special meeting of council today at noon\\" at which it would be recommended that the university's council \\"reverse its response to the UUK survey in line with the congregation‚Äôs resolution\\". In an interview with the Daily Telegraph in July 2019 Louise Richardson addressed the issue of higher education funding in the UK, noting that \\"Our American competitors are so far ahead of us in fundraising\\". Her approach has been to explore alternative sources of funding, including a fundraising campaign, the Oxford Thinking Campaign, that raised ¬£3.3 billion; a ¬£4 billion partnership with Legal and General to provide staff housing and science facilities; securing a ¬£150 million donation from US billionaire Stephen Schwarzman to fund humanities research at the University of Oxford; securing an ¬£80 million donation from the Reuben Foundation to endow Reuben College (formerly Parks College); and a ¬£750 million bond issuance in December 2017 (increased to ¬£1 billion in 2020) \\\\- the biggest amount raised this way by a UK university. Amidst the 2019-20 Hong Kong protests, Professor Richardson was recognized for her leadership and advocacy. Professor Richardson was \\"admirably robust when threatened by the Chinese embassy with the withdrawal of Chinese students from Oxford unless she stopped its chancellor Chris Patten visiting Hong Kong\\", and was noted as having \\"more balls than any male [Vice-Chancellor]\\". As part of efforts to broaden access to the University of Oxford, Richardson committed the University to ensuring that by 2023, 25% of the British students admitted will be from underrepresented backgrounds ‚Äì compared to 15% as of 2019. Finances and criticism Richardson's salary was criticised as excessive in 2017 (quoted as ¬£410,000). Richardson has separately been criticized for abuse of expenses, including claiming ¬£70,000 in a single year on travel and dining as Vice- Chancellor. Professor Richardson publicly lists her expenses on the University website. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she received further criticism for retaining her salary while University of Oxford staff were put on furlough. In September 2017, Richardson attracted criticism from students, academics, politicians, and the British press for remarks made in defence of academic freedom that were interpreted by critics as a defence of academics holding anti-gay views towards students. Richardson had previously been involved in debates around free speech and around attempts by university students to bar some speakers from campuses. At the University of St. Andrews, Richardson encouraged academics to share their views on the independence referendum and in her first few months at Oxford University she voiced the view that higher education was not meant to be a comfortable experience and that students ought to engage with views they found objectionable. Richardson's comments in June 2020 during the Black Lives Matter protests attracted further public criticism. She suggested that Nelson Mandela would not have wanted the controversial statue of Cecil Rhodes removed. Research Richardson is the author of What Terrorists Want, an account of terrorism written after the September 11 attacks. Other publications include When Allies Differ: Anglo- American Relations in the Suez and Falkland Crises, The Roots of Terrorism (ed) and Democracy and Counterterrorism: Lessons from the Past (co-edited with Robert Art). She has also published many journal articles, book chapters, and reviews on the subject of terrorism. Between 2001 and 2008, in addition to her teaching and management roles, Richardson gave over 300 talks and lectures on terrorism and counter-terrorism to educational and private groups as well as policy makers, the military, intelligence, and business communities. She has testified before the United States Senate and has appeared on CNN, the BBC, PBS, NPR, Fox and a host of other broadcast outlets. Her work has been featured in numerous international periodicals. =Published works= * What Terrorists Want: Understanding the Enemy, Containing the Threat (2006) * The Roots of Terrorism, Routledge, New York (2006) ed * When Allies Differ: Anglo- American Relations in the Suez and Falkland Crises (1996) * Democracy and Counterterrorism: Lessons from the Past, United States Institute of Peace, Washington DC (2007) ed with Robert Art Awards and honours In 2009 Richardson received the Trinity College Dublin Alumni Award.\\"Trinity College Alumni Awards 2009\\" , Trinity College Dublin communications office, November 2009 In 2010 she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE), and in 2011 she was appointed to the Scottish Government's Council of Economic Advisers.\\"Council of Economic Advisers\\", Scottish Government, 4 November 2011 In 2012, ahead of the centenary in 2014 of the outbreak of World War One, she was appointed to the Scottish Commemorations Panel.\\"About the Scottish Commemorations Panel  Mun Phannal Cuimhneachain Albannach\\", Scottish Commemorations Panel In 2013 Harvard University awarded Professor Richardson The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Centennial Medal, and later in the year she received an honorary doctorate from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO).

STRA6 is unique as it functions both as a membrane transporter and a cell surface receptor, particularly as a cytokine receptor. In fact, STRA6 may be the first of a whole new class of proteins that might be known as \\"cytokine signaling transporters.\\" STRA6 is primarily known as the receptor for retinol binding protein and for its relevance in the transport of retinol to specific sites such as the eye (Vitamin A). It does this through the removal of retinol (ROH) from the holo-Retinol Binding Protein (RBP) and transports it into the cell to be metabolized into retinoids and/or kept as a retinylester. As a receptor, after holo-RBP is bound, STRA6 activates the JAK/STAT pathway, resulting in the activation of transcription factor, STAT5. These two functions‚Äîretinol transporter and cytokine receptor‚Äîwhile using different pathways, are processes that depend on each other. Mechanism of action =Overview= In the first step, holo-retinol binding protein (holo- RBP; simply means RBP bound to retinol, i.e. the RBP-ROH complex) binds to the extracellular portion of STRA6. This facilitates the release of retinol through the transporter. ROH is then transferred to cellular retinol binding protein 1 (CRBP1), an intracellular acceptor of retinol that attaches to the CRBP Binding Loop (or CBL) on STRA6. This transport of ROH, in turn, activates JAK2, thereby phosphorylating STRA6 at the Y643 (tyrosine) residue. This phosphorylation enables the extension of the CBL further into the cell. Holo- CRBP-I, leaves the CBL and is replaced by apo-CRBP-I (unbound). Holo-CRBP-I will continue to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) where lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) is bound. ROH is released to LRAT which will convert retinol into retinylesters. Following the release of holo-CRBP-I from intercellular STRA6, STAT5 is recruited to STRA6 phosphorylated Y643 region where it is then phosphorylated by JAK2. This phosphorylation activates STAT5 which then makes its way to the nucleus to induce expression of target genes including suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a strong inhibitor of insulin signaling. =Interdependency of cytokine signaling transporter functions= Research has demonstrated that overexpression of CRBP-I increases the ability of RBP-ROH complex to phosphorylate STRA6 and, later, JAK2 and STAT5. Suppressing CRBP-I, on the other hand, led to decreased ability of RBP- ROH complex to phosphorylate STRA6 and signaling components. Similarly, reducing the expression of LRAT also decreased the ability of RBP-ROH complex to phosphorylate JAK2 and STAT5. Therefore, both CRBP-I and LRAT are necessary for the STRA6 signaling cascade upon the binding and transport of retinol. JAK2 is also conversely responsible for the activation of STRA6, after which apo-CRBP-I is recruited to the intercellular CBL of STRA6 and vitamin A might be transferred by the receptor to CRBP-I. Thus, both STRA6 signaling and STRA6 transport of vitamin A are dependent upon each other. Uptake of retinol is required for STRA6 signaling and JAK2 activation of STRA6 is necessary for retinol uptake. Clinical significance STRA6 can be found at high levels in various tissues including: the choroid plexus, the brain microvascular, tesis, the spleen, kidney, eye, the placenta, and the female reproductive tract. However, it is surprisingly not found in liver tissue where Vitamin A (retinol) is primarily stored. Because of its importance in Vitamin A transport, STRA6 mutations are more commonly associated with problems with eye such as a reduction in retinal thickness and shortening of the inner and outer segments of rod photoreceptors. Therefore, as might be expected, STRA6 mutations result in a number of different abnormalities of the eye such as Microphthalmia, Anophthalmia, and Coloboma. However, STRA6 is clearly vital for more than just eye development as it is expressed in many different tissues detailed above. Other disorders that result from STRA6 mutations include pulmonary dysgenesis, cardiac malformations, and mental retardation. In fact, research has shown that homozygous mutations in human STRA6 gene can lead to Matthew-Wood syndrome, which is a combination of all the mentioned disorders. In this respect, STRA6 mutations can be particularly fatal during the embryonic stage. STRA6 has also been associated with facilitating insulin resistance. This is because STRA6 signaling results in activation of transcription factor STAT5 target genes. One of these target genes is a suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) which is a strong inhibitor of insulin signaling. As a result, STRA6 signaling suppresses the response to insulin by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, IR, by an influx of insulin. In other words, increased levels of the RBP in obese animals (which will increase STRA6 activity) can facilitate insulin resistance. Due to this close relationship between STRA6 and insulin resistance, it has been demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in STRA6 are associated with Type 2 Diabetes.

The author appears to be living in the Persian Empire, perhaps somewhere near the Lesser Zab, as it is mentioned in Memra Thirty, and addresses the author's own Christian community.  Summary  The Book of Steps is divided into thirty chapters, or discourses (, m√™mr√™). The first discourse, and subsequent ones (especially number 14), divides the community into two groups. One group is called the perfect (, gm√Ær√™), to whom the stricter major commandments apply. The other group is called the upright (, k√™n√™), who seem to comprise the remainder of the community, to whom only lesser commandments (which are described as spiritual milk to the solid food of the major commandments ‚Äî Hebrews ) apply. The lesser commandments are outworkings of the Golden Rule (Matthew and Luke ), and represent a life devoted to charity. On the other hand, the 'perfect' are expected to renounce family, marriage and property so as to receive baptism of fire and Spirit. This division of the community echoes a similar division in Manichaeism. The teaching of the Book of Steps has been described as Messalian by some scholars (including Kmosk√≥ the editor of the critical Syriac edition). However, Brock has demonstrated that the Book of Steps emphasis on the structure of the visible church (particularly strong in discourse 12) shows that its doctrine is quite removed from Messalianism. An English translation of the entirety of the Book of Steps by Kitchen and Parmentier has recently been published. The headings of the thirty chapters, or discourses, are as follows: # On the distinction between the major commandments, for the perfect, and the minor commandments, for the upright. # On those who wish to be perfect. # The physical and the spiritual ministry. # On vegetables for the sick (see Romans ). # On milk for infants (see I Corinthians ). # On the person who becomes perfect and continues to grow. # On the commandments for the upright. # On the person who gives all he has to the poor to eat. # On uprightness and on the love of the upright and of prophets. # On the advantage we have when we endure evil while performing good; and on fasting and humiliation of body and soul. # On hearing the Scriptures, and when the Law is read before us. # On the ministry of the hidden and the revealed church (English trans. in and ). # On the way of life of the upright. # On the upright and the perfect. # On the marriage instinct in Adam. # On how a person grows as a result of the major commandments. # On the sufferings of our Lord, by which an example is provided for us. # On the tears of prayer (English trans. in ). # On the distinguishing characteristics of the way of perfection. # On the hard steps on the way. # On the Tree of Adam. # On the judgments by which those who make them are not saved. # On Satan, Pharaoh and the Children of Israel. # On repentance. # On the voice of God and that of Satan. # On the second law which the Lord laid down for Adam. # On the matter of the thief who was saved. # On the human soul not being blood. # On subduing the body. # On the commandments of faith and of love of the solitaries.

RBP4 has a molecular weight of approximately 21 kDa and is encoded by the RBP4 gene in humans. It is mainly, though not exclusively, synthesized in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream bound to retinol in a complex with transthyretin. RBP4 has been a drug target for ophthalmology research due to its role in vision. RBP4 may also be involved in metabolic diseases as suggested by recent studies.  Function  This protein belongs to the lipocalin family and is the specific carrier for retinol (vitamin A) in the blood. It delivers retinol from the liver stores to the peripheral tissues. In plasma, the RBP-retinol complex interacts with transthyretin, which prevents its loss by filtration through the kidney glomeruli. A deficiency of vitamin A blocks secretion of the binding protein posttranslationally and results in defective delivery and supply to the epidermal cells.  Structure  Two molecules of RBP4 (in yellow and red) bound to retinol (in orange) complexed with four molecules of TTR (in purple and blue) RBP4 is a single polypeptide chain with a hydrophobic pocket where retinol binds. The RBP4-retinol complex then binds transthyretin in circulation to prevent renal filtration of RBP4. In serum, TTR and RBP4 bind in a 1 to 1 stoichiometry (two molecules of TTR combine with two molecules of RBP4 to form a complex with a total molecular weight of approximately 80,000 Daltons).  Clinical significance  Retinol-binding protein 4 has been a drug target for eye diseases as RBP4 is the sole carrier for retinol, which is an essential nutrient for the visual cycle. Animal studies using RBP4-antagonists showed that lowering RBP4 can lead to reduction in the accumulation of lipofuscin that leads to vision loss in eye diseases like Stargardt's disease and macular degeneration.An animal study using ABCA4 knockout mouse proved that reduction in serum RBP4 level could inhibit lipofuscin without inhibiting the visual cycle.[ref] One clinical study in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was conducted using Fenretinide. The study showed trends in reducing lesion growth rate in AMD and rate of conversion from early stage AMD (dry AMD) to late stage AMD (wet AMD) without serious side effects. RBP4 has recently been described as an adipokine that contributes to insulin resistance and diabetes in the AG4KO mouse model. In addition to the liver, RBP4 is also secreted by adipocytes of the fat tissue in a smaller portion and acts as a signal to surrounding cells, when there is a decrease in plasma glucose concentration. It is suspected that an elevated level of RBP4 attracts macrophages to the fat tissue, causes local inflammation, and leads to insulin resistance. Mutations in the RBP4 gene have recently been linked to a form of autosomal dominant microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and coloboma (MAC) disease. A unique feature of this disease is the maternal inheritance effect, when a fetus inherits a mutated copy of the RBP4 gene from its mother, but not from its father. The physiologic basis lies in pregnancy whereby the mutated gene product, retinol binding protein (RBP), has negative effects in transferring vitamin A from maternal liver storage sites to the placenta, and then again on the fetal circulation side when delivering vitamin A from the placenta to developing fetal tissues, most notably the developing eye. This 'double whammy' effect does not exist when the mutant RBP4 gene is inherited from the father. The above mechanism is separate from previously known types of maternal inheritance effects such as genomic imprinting, mitochondrial inheritance, or maternal oocyte mRNA transfer. The authors of the above study cite the potential of vitamin A supplementation in pregnant females who are known to carry an RBP4 mutation with retinyl ester which utilizes an RBP-independent pathway to deliver retinoids from the maternal intestines directly to the placenta and ultimately is uptaken by the fetus. The key would be to supplement during the first several months of life when the eye begins to develop, as supplementing later in pregnancy would be too late to avoid any potential MAC disease.

Governor-General of the Philippines =Government in Iloilo= In September 1898, he became the Governor-General of the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War after the United States of America took control of Manila after the 1898 Battle of Manila. The capital of the Spanish Philippines was at that time in Iloilo. While fighting with the Americans was over, the Spanish authorities continued to fight the forces of the Philippine Revolution for control of the country outside of Manila and Manila Bay Desiring to save the Visayas and Mindanao from being conquered by Philippine revolutionary forces, de los Rios asked Spain to grant some reforms demanded by citizens of Iloilo. He issued in Iloilo a proclamation to the people of the Visayas calling on them to establish a \\"Council of Reforms\\" to be made up of 24 leading citizens, 12 of whom would be selected by popular vote and another 12 to be appointed by the governor-general himself. The granted reforms, however, satisfied only a few ilustrado leaders and the Philippine revolution in Iloilo heated up. The general uprising against the Spanish authorities on Panay, particularly in Iloilo, took place on October 28, 1898. On that day onward, the interior towns of the province of Iloilo were liberated from Spanish control. By the first week of November, only Jaro, Molo, and Iloilo remained in the hands of the Spaniards. On November 21, Jaro was delivered by the Spanish government to the Ilonggo revolutionary forces. His term as Governor-General of the Philippines legally ended on December 10, 1898 when the Treaty of Paris was signed transferring sovereignty of the Philippines from the Spanish Empire to the United States of America. The Philippine Revolution however continued, and would become the Philippine-American War early in 1899. With the Spanish army being besieged by the revolutionary troops in the positions which they held in Iloilo and Molo, and being threatened by a decisive attack, the Spanish government under De los Rios eventually opened up negotiations with the Ilonggos. The outcome of the negotiations was the evacuation of Molo and Iloilo City by the Spanish troops and their subsequent surrender to the native forces under the command of Gen. Martin Delgado at Plaza Alfonso XII (now Plaza Libertad) on December 23, 1898 which implied Iloilo City as the last capital of the Spanish Empire in Asia and the Pacific. (other formats available) He left Iloilo and transferred temporarily to Real Fuerza de Nuestra Se√±ora La Virgen del Pilar de Zaragoza in Zamboanga bringing with him the remnants of his colonial forces in the Visayas on the eve of the surrender of the Spanish forces in Visayas to the Ilonggo revolutionaries in December 24, 1898. Thereafter when moved to Zamboanga as his last bastion, he surrendered to the authorities. =In Zamboanga= The Governor-General upon his arrival at Fort Pilar on December 24, 1898 immediately made preparations for the defense against the Philippine revolutionaries. He brought the colonial forces from Cotabato and Lanao and consolidated them all at Fort Pilar. The Governor-General of Mindanao Island, General Jaramillo, transferred his command to General Montero, ex-governor of Cebu, and left for Manila with General Rios in Dec. 1898. =In Manila= General Diego de los Rios brought his troops to Manila in January 1899, before the troops' departure to Spain. The general remained in Manila until 3 June 1899, trying to secure the release of Spanish prisoners from the rebels. General Nicola Jaramillo then took over negotiations.

The device was designed by Microsoft. History The device was first unveiled at the COMDEX conference in November 1999, where it was first described as a 'MSN-based Web companion'. In June 2000, Vestel USA Inc, Compaq and eMachines began working with Microsoft to create the first MSN Companions. Mock-ups of RCA, Acer and Inventec Companions were also seen. While the MSN Companion was initially received with praise, it did not perform successfully in the market and Microsoft and MSN stopped providing support for Companions in October 2003. Early Companion models All MSN Companions ran an early version of Microsoft Windows CE, and were shipped with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0. However, the hardware provided by each manufacturer was significantly different, with some companies choosing to use a wireless keyboard over a wired one. The Vestel package included a 15-inch monitor (or a 10-inch LCD monitor) and a PS/2 keyboard with a touchpad. The device itself had 32MB (+16MB flash) of memory, a 200 MHz Geode processor, two USB ports, a phone jack, and a parallel port. The eMachines package was similar, offering a 17 or 19-inch monitor instead of an LCD one and an 'eBoard' keyboard and standalone mouse. The Compaq MSN Companion shipped with an LCD screen and a wireless keyboard with a mouse built-in. Compaq machines had 32MB (+16MB flash) of memory, a 266 MHz AMD processor, four USB ports, a phone jack, and, in some models, an ethernet port for networking.

Tullgarn Palace, where Sophie Hagman lived with Frederick Adolf from 1778 to 1793. Anna Sophia \\"Sophie\\" Hagman, n√©e Anna Kristina \\"Stina\\" Hagman (31 December 1758, in Eskilstuna, S√∂dermanland, Sweden ‚Äì 6 May 1826, in Stockholm, Sweden), was a Swedish ballet dancer. She was the official royal mistress to Prince Frederick Adolf of Sweden from 1778 to 1793.  Early life  Sophie Hagman was born in Eskilstuna as the daughter of the carpenter Peter Hagman (d. 1772) and Elisabet Hedman (d. 1767).Anna Stina (Sophie) Hagman, www.skbl.se/sv/artikel/SophieHagman, Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon (artikel av Marie Steinrud), h√§mtad 2018-06-01. She had two sisters, Christina Catharina och Elisabeth, and at least one brother, Carl Peter Hagman. She may have had another brother: in 1780, Prince Frederick expressed his intention to do something for the soldier Lars Hagman from Str√§ngn√§s, who was active in the S√∂dermanland Regiment and previously unknown to him, probably because he was the brother of Sophie Hagman, and it was the custom for soldiers to serve in the same regiment as their fathers. Her brother-in-law, Anders Erling, was a carpenter in Stockholm. In 1762, she moved to Lov√∂n in Stockholm with her family. After the death of her father in 1772, she was employed to look after the children to Louis Gallodier, dance master of the Royal Swedish Ballet at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm.Anna Stina (Sophie) Hagman, www.skbl.se/sv/artikel/SophieHagman, Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon (artikel av Marie Steinrud), h√§mtad 2018-06-01. She was then the maid to the lady-in-waiting Baroness Charlotte Manderstr√∂m and later served as the maid to lady-in-waiting Hedvig Catharina Piper. During her employment with Piper, according to courtier count Lars von Engestr√∂m, she was \\"a little girl, and everyone laughed at her because she was in love with Duke Frederik.\\" She ended her employment at Piper and entered into a relationship with a young merchant, and brewer, who supported her financially and paid for her education at a sewing school. The Austrian ambassador to Sweden, count Joseph Kaunitz, offered money to both Hagman herself and to her lover to have her for himself, but both her lover and Hagman herself refused because they were mutually in love with each other and because \\"the brewer was more of a beautiful man than the count.\\" The relationship ended because the man died, and Hagman was forced to end her education to a seamstress. The dates for these events are not clear. From 1775, Sophie Hagman had a position as a dancer in the Royal Ballet. She never became very known as a ballet dancer and was said to have been more noted for her appearance than her talent; in 1776, she is briefly mentioned as one of the shepherdesses in a ballet. In 1778, Prince Frederick Adolf noticed her during her performance as a pageboy, and after having seduced her, he became genuinely in love with her. The year after, 1779, she is no longer recorded as employed in the ballet and are noted to be living with Frederick.Anna Stina (Sophie) Hagman, www.skbl.se/sv/artikel/SophieHagman, Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon (artikel av Marie Steinrud), h√§mtad 2018-06-01.  Introduction at court  After becoming the mistress of Prince Frederick Adolf, Sophie Hagman was said to have studied French and etiquette. She was also given the name Sophie instead of the more common Anna Stina. On 2 January 1780, she was presented at the royal court at Gripsholm Castle as the official lover of Frederick Adolf by permission of king Gustav III of Sweden. It is likely that Gustav III gave his permission because of his admiration for the French court, where official mistresses was common. The informal presentation was unique, attracted a lot of attention and is related in most details by courtier Gustaf Johan Ehrensv√§rd: > Duke Frederick had negotiated for permission from His Majesty to present > Mamsell Hagman for the Crown Prince. His Majesty duly agreed to this, as it > seemed, starting point for future privileges for her. Everything must happen > according to a certain pattern at court. So did this. The Duke had > instructed Count Leijonstedt to escort her from his apartments to that of > the Crown Prince, where they Duke was already present, and announced to > Countess Rosen that he had been given the permission of His Majesty to have > her presented to the Crown Prince. When Leijonstedt announced himself as the > escort of this beauty, the Duke himself left the room, received her and > escorted her into the room of the Crown Prince, stepped forward and > performed a presentation. Mamsell Hagman kissed his hand and started to > converse the ladies, to whom she was also presented. Her conversation was > relaxed and pleasant; she displayed much modesty and respect but no shyness > or submission. The Duke did not sit, making it necessary for the ladies to > remain standing, so that his Mamsell would not have to remain the only one > standing. It would not have been possible for her to sit down in the > presence of the Crown Prince. Countess Rosen, who noticed this, asked the > Duke to sit, but he pretended not to hear, continued his conversation, and > after the visit had passed one half hour, both the Duke and the beauty > retired, satisfied and full of relief over this first step. The ladies of > the Crown Prince, initially somewhat scandalised over this visit, soon found > themselves content and spoke much to the advantage of Mamsell Hagman. The > Duke had since long planned this and made himself the friend of all the > ladies of the court. To be presented for the female members of the court, was a sign that she was accepted, as it was socially acceptable to present a mistress for male nobles, but not for female ones.  Official mistress  Sophie Hagman appeared openly with the prince at court, which together with Hedvig Taube made her one of only two official royal mistresses in the history of Sweden. She was called: \\"My little daughter-in-law\\" by the Queen Dowager and \\"Dearest Sister-in-law\\" by the king.Wilhelmina St√•lberg : Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (English: \\"Notes on Swedish women\\") The Poet Bellman called her an image of beauty: \\"Her entire being was a fest to my eyes\\", and the King once embraced her as a sister-in-law at Gripsholm Castle. The female courtiers was initially very snobby toward her, but Sophie Hagman understood how to make herself liked by most. Eventually, even Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, known as a strict moralist and highly disproving of all extramarital sexuality, acknowledges her quality and admitted that she had made a good impression on everyone. It was said that: \\"She differed from other royal mistresses in that she never abused her position by enriching herself\\". In 1780, the relationship was temporarily broken because of Frederick Adolf's infatuation and marriage plans to Countess Margareta Lovisa Wrangel. Sophie Hagman was met with great sympathy at court because of the good impression she had made and because she was now without means to support herself, and Gustav III therefore promised her a pension. When the marriage negotiations with Wrangel failed and the Frederick Adolf lost interested in her in 1781, he returned to Hagman and resumed the relationship with her. She was to have explained to him that she could no longer love him after he had hurt her, and after this, Frederick Adolf was never known to have been unfaithful to her. Sophie Hagman was given rooms at the Royal Palace, Stockholm, and became the hostess at Tullgarn Palace, the private residence of Prince Frederick Adolf. Her relationship with the prince is described as a union of mutual love and happiness, and she never asked for any financial favours from him or from any other connections she made through him. Though she apparently never asked for anything, she was given many gifts without having asked for them. She was given three country estates by Frederick Adolf, a pension of 2.000 riksdaler by Gustav III to be paid annually as an insurance if her relationship to the prince was ever to end, and promised the title of Countess by Gustav III if she and Frederick Adolf was ever to have a son. Sophie Hagman made a lasting impression of being unselfish. Count Adolf Ludvig Hamilton said about her: \\"It was impossible for anyone in her place to have been more noble\\" and described one episode in detail. At one occasion, the prince bought her an expensive Jewelry (a ring) on credit without paying for it, and the jeweler, who was in a difficult economic position, was waiting in the chamber of the prince day after day. Hagman noticed him, and when he described the situation, she said: \\"The prince are at present not in the possession of money, I can all too well live without this ornament, but not without your welfare,\\" after which she returned the jewel to the jeweler in return for his promise to say nothing of the episode. Nevertheless, this story became well known and contributed to her good reputation. In 1784, Axel von Fersen the Elder reported that Prince Frederick Adolf lived a quite private life with Sophie Hagman in a circle of close friends, and in 1786, Princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte confirms that the prince isolated himself with Hagman at his estate, completely taken by her beauty. Sophie Hagman followed him to the royal palaces and to his official tasks. About Sophie Hagman as the hostess of Tullgarn Palace she was described by Ehrensv√§rd: > \\"Mamsell Hagman was quite like a lady of the court. Her conversation was > relaxed and pleasant. She displayed modesty and respect but no shyness or > submission. The ladies showed her utmost respect. The gentlemen counted > themselves lucky if the gave them but a minute\\"; she handled her role as a > hostess: \\"Not with the arrogant pride of a Princess, but with the natural > politeness of the middle class. And such a hostess this was! The appearance > of a Venus, the manners of a Juno, the virtues of a Hebe.\\" This was later referred to this as \\"The Golden Age of Miss Sophie Hagman\\". There are a lot of episodes about the period of Sophie Hagman at Tullgarn, referred to as \\"Tullgarnsminnerna\\" (\\"Tullgarn memories\\"). Frederick Adolf was an eager hunter, and Hagman participated in the hunt with his male hunting friends. A poem was published about one of these hunts in 1847, named \\"Hertig Fredrik, Mamsell Hagman och gamla Margaretha\\" (\\"Duke Frederick, Mamsell Hagman and old Margaretha\\"), where the male hunting party was to have directed their attention to her rather than to the hunt itself, and during which Hagman met a beggar, old Margaretha, which she helped in the way with was associated with her; this episode was to have happened in 1791. The 20 February 1787, a baby girl was baptised to Sophia Fredrica with Frederick Adolf and Sophie Hagman as godparents. The other godparents was Count Adolf Piper, Count Carl Posse, the nobles Pehr Reinhold Tersmeden and Pehr Sparre and professor Schulzenheim. The records states that \\"The parents shall remain unrecorded\\", but she is believed to have been the daughter of Frederick Adolf and Sophie Hagman. There are no more information about Sophia Fredrica. During the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì1790), Frederick Adolf came in conflict with the King, refused to serve under his brother Charles and left the army in December 1788. Both Gustav III, Princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte and Princess Sophie Albertine of Sweden recommended that they should ask for Hagman's intervention, but there are no mention whether they actually did. During the absence of Frederick Adolf in Finland during the war, Sophie Hagman was courted by Anders Hahr (1764‚Äì1845), \\"a handsome young landlord\\", and when Frederick Adolf returned, she was pregnant by Hahr. Both Sophie Hagman and Ander Hahr expressed themselves willing to marry each other, but the prince refused to end his relationship with her. Frederick Adolf later returned to the war. While leaving for his permission in 1789, Gustav III uttered: \\"I expect he has left to attend to his Hares.\\" Despite the fact that Sophie Hagman was said to have been pregnant at several occasions, there are no information which confirms that she had any children.  Later life  The relationship between Sophie Hagman and Frederick Adolf ended amiable in 1793, as it seems by mutual consent, after which they both had other relationships. Frederick Adolf replaced her with the actress Euphrosyne L√∂f, while Sophie Hagman entered into a relationship with the singer and composer Edvard du Puy. The relationship with Du Puy was to have led to the birth of a child, though there are no information of a child. The relationship ended when Du Puy left on a trip for Germany, where she followed him only to be refused. Hagman visited Copenhagen in 1795 and a second time in the early 19th century. The second time she was in the company of Du Puy under the name \\"Mrs Hedengrahn\\". The first time, she was in the company of a \\"Mrs Jouffrouy\\", the wife of Prince Frederick Adolf's economy minister, and met the poet and bishop Franz Michael Franz√©n, who wrote a description of their encounter. He described her as still beautiful and worthy of respect for never having abused her influence over the Duke. At this point, she apparently had the responsibility of her brother's children, as she told Franz√©n that she contemplated to arrange a place for her nephew on an East India ship, but there are no more information of that. In 1796 and 1802, she made pleasure trips to Paris under the name \\"Madame Hedengrahn\\" in the company of Captain Carl Christian Ehrenhoff. In 1801, she apparently had plans to marry Ehrenhoff, but the plans were never effectuated. Sophie Hagman lived the last years of her life \\"admired for her still preserved beauty, her lovable, pleasant being and her good heart\\", and was a popular hostess, giving small balls and suppers for people such as the sculptor Johan Tobias Sergel. She spent the winters in Stockholm and her summers at the villa Lilla Kina near Drottningholm Palace. She lived with her sister, Elisabeth Bjurstr√∂m, who was a widow after an officer, and her two nieces Sophie Bjurstr√∂m and Augusta Bjurstr√∂m and nephew Pehr Bjurstr√∂m. After her relationship to Prince Frederick Adolf ended, Sophie Hagman lived on a royal pension. When Frederick Adolf died, she received a second pension from the state. These pensions was, among others granted from the royal house, exposed to critic from Baron Stael von Holstein on Riddarhuset in 1809. Sophie Hagman died in 1826 and willed her property to her sister's children and to her close friend Jeanette Stenstr√∂m. References Sources * Carin √ñsterberg: Svenska Kvinnor.

Legal position In South Africa, a woman of any age can get an abortion on request with no reasons given if she is less than 13 weeks pregnant. If she is between 13 and 20 weeks pregnant, she can get the abortion if (a) her own physical or mental health is at stake, (b) the baby will have severe mental or physical abnormalities, (c) she is pregnant because of incest, (d) she is pregnant because of rape, or (e) she is of the personal opinion that her economic or social situation is sufficient reason for the termination of pregnancy. If she is more than 20 weeks pregnant, she can get the abortion only if her or the fetus' life is in danger or there are likely to be serious birth defects.Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, Act 92 of 1996 A woman under the age of 18 will be advised to consult her parents, but she can decide not to inform or consult them if she so chooses. A woman who is married or in a life-partner relationship will be advised to consult her partner, but she can decide not to inform or consult him/her. An exception is that if the woman is severely mentally ill or has been unconscious for a long time, where consent of a life-partner, parent or legal guardian is required. The Constitution does not explicitly mention abortion, but two sections of the Bill of Rights mention reproductive rights. Section 12(2)(a) states that, \\"Everyone has the right to bodily and psychological integrity, which includes the right [...] to make decisions concerning reproduction,\\" while section 27(1)(a) states \\"Everyone has the right to have access to [...] health care services, including reproductive health care.\\" In the case of Christian Lawyers Association v Minister of Health an anti-abortion organisation challenged the validity of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act on the basis that it violated the right to life in section 11 of the Bill of Rights; the Transvaal Provincial Division of the High Court dismissed their argument, ruling that constitutional rights only apply to born people and not to fetuses.Christian Lawyers Association of SA and Others v Minister of Health and Others 1998 (4) SA 1113 (T) (10 July 1998), Transvaal Provincial Division In general, only medical doctors may perform abortions. Nurses who have received special training may also perform abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy. A medicine-induced abortion can be performed by any medical doctor at his/her premises up to 7 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period. The usual method is a dose of an antiprogestin, followed by a dose of a prostaglandin analogue two days later. Health workers are under no obligation to perform or take active part in an abortion if they do not wish to; however, they are obligated by law to assist if it is required to save the life of the patient, even if the emergency is related to an abortion.Choice On Termination Of Pregnancy A health worker who is approached by a woman for an abortion may decline if they choose to do so, but are obligated by law to inform the woman of her rights and refer her to another health worker or facility where she can get the abortion.Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) Abortion can be had for free at certain state hospitals or clinics, although sometimes only if the woman is referred by a health worker. Most abortion centres will insist on providing pre- and post-abortion counselling, and the woman can legally demand it, but it is not a legal requirement that abortion centres provide it.  Statistics  There has since the legalisation of abortion on demand been a decrease in deaths from backstreet abortions, but the number of deaths following abortions are still quite high according to statistics gathered in Gauteng province‚Äî5% of maternal deaths following childbirth are abortion related, and 57% of these are related to illegal abortions.Dawes, A.

The ramp sits at an acute angle to deflect the intake air from the longitudinal direction. At supersonic flight speeds, the deflection of the air stream creates a number of oblique shock waves at each change of gradient along at the ramp. Air crossing each shock wave suddenly slows to a lower Mach number, thus increasing pressure. Ideally, the first oblique shock wave should intercept the air intake lip, thus avoiding air spillage and pre-entry drag on the outer boundary of the deflected streamtube. For a fixed geometry intake at zero incidence, this condition can only be achieved at one particular flight Mach number, because the angle of the shock wave (to the longitudinal direction) becomes more acute with increasing aircraft speed. More advanced supersonic intakes feature a ramp with a number of discrete changes of gradient in order to generate multiple oblique shock waves. In the case of Concorde, the first (converging) intake ramp is followed by a diverging ramp. After the air passes the end of the first ramp it has become subsonic such that the diverging ramp further contributes towards the reduction in airstream velocity and consequently its increase in pressure. This intake design thus ensures excellent pressure recovery and contributes to Concorde's improved fuel efficiency whilst cruising supersonically at up to Mach 2.2 (beyond which airframe heating effects limit any further increase in speed).A Case Study By Aerospatiale And Bristol Aerospace On The Concorde, Jean Rich and Clive S. Leyman, AIAA Professional Study Series, section 6.2 Intakes Variable geometry intakes, such as those on Concorde, vary the ramp angle to focus the series of oblique shock waves onto the intake lip, control of which is accomplished by complex non- linear control laws using the ramp void pressure (the pressure of the air in the gap between the two ramps) as a control input. The intake ramp for rectangular intakes has its equivalent in the inlet cone for circular intakes. Much simpler and lighter alternatives are used on modern aircraft which are not designed for such high speeds. They include the caret compression surface, used in the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor inlets, and the diverterless supersonic inlet used on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Chengdu J-20.

Since 1992, Takara has recorded 6 studio albums for several different record labels in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. Founding member and lead guitarist Neal Grusky, and bassist Carl Demarco have remained permanent fixtures in the band since its early days. Biography =1980s - Early days= Takara was formed in August 1987. After a few months of rehearsals the band made their debut in October with a show in Hollywood, California. The band proceeded to play many more shows throughout 1987-88. In November 1988, Takara went into the studio to record their first demo with producer Jeff Scott Soto. As they entered the studio it became apparent that the singer was not ready to record. In order to finish the new Takara demo, Soto was asked to help out by providing vocals for the demo. This was the beginning of a long relationship between the band and Jeff Scott Soto. =1990s - The Soto era= In 1990, Takara went back into the studio to record what would eventually become their debut album, Eternal Faith. In 1992 Takara regrouped and added new members who would perform in Eternal Faith. The line-up was ultimately completed with Jeff Scott Soto on vocals, Neal Grusky on guitar, Gary Schutt on bass and Bob Duda on drums. In August 1993, Zero Corporation (Japan) and Now and Then records (Europe) offered Takara a deal to release Eternal Faith in December 1993. After a short break the band began to work on what was to become their second album. Before rehearsals began, bassist Carl Demarco replaced Schutt and they returned to the studio to record Taste of Heaven. The band enlisted Bob Daisley on bass for guest performances on two songs. Taste of Heaven was released in May 1995 by Zero Corporation (Japan) and Long Island records (Europe). Upon its release, Taste of Heaven had commercial success, and Long Island records brought Takara to Germany for a promo tour. In 1996 Saraya Recordings, a new US label, asked permission to re-release Eternal Faith and Taste of Heaven as its first releases. Feeling that there was momentum starting to build, the band wasted no time in working on their third album. In 1998 they released Blind in Paradise through Zero Corporation (Japan), Point Music (Europe), and Saraya Recordings (US). Shortly after the release of ‚ÄòBlind in Paradise‚Äô, all of Takara's labels released a greatest hits album Eternity: Best of 93 - 98. =2000-2010 Changes to the Lineup= In late 1998, the Takara went through significant lineup changes, leaving only guitarist/band leader Neal Grusky and bassist Carl Demarco to rebuild begin writing new material. The band found drummer Chad Clark and keyboardist Brook Hansen. Brook and Neal had known each other for years and always shared similar ideas on music. The last to come aboard was vocalist Michael J. Flatters, who Grusky found through a mutual friend. With the band complete, Takara re-entered the studio in February 2000 to record their fourth album, Perception of Reality. One year later, it was completed and released on the Avalon Marquee (Japan), Lion Music (Europe), and Metal Mayhem (US) labels. After a hiatus of several years, Grusky decided to reform Takara in 2008, once again with a new lineup. This lineup saw the arrival of several new members including Bjorn Englen (bass), Patrick Johannson (drums), and vocalist Gus Monsanto. Keyboardist Brook Hansen returned to the lineup.Jeff Scott Soto also returned after ten years to provide harmony vocals for the resulting 2008 album entitled Invitation to Forever. This album, released by Progrock Records, marked a turning point for Takara with Grusky taking his powerful songwriting to a much harder edge than on previous Takara albums. The album subsequently gained mass approval by fans and progressive rock critics alike. =Current Lineup and New Album= After the release of Invitation To Forever guitarist and bandleader Neal Grusky was faced some tough decisions. Feeling that the band had gone too far in the direction of a studio project with hired musicians contributing internationally, he opted to change the lineup once again in hopes of finding fresh local talent willing to pursue the local LA club scene. Grusky brought back Carl Demarco now \\"Carla DeMarco\\" \\"on bass, reuniting the core of Takara. After a long search for a suitable vocal talent, the band found Jamie Kelli, who had been regularly performing in the LA area. Drummer Gene McEwen, also active in the local scene, completed the lineup. With Kelli filling in temporarily on keyboards, Takara proceeded to prepare for a series of live shows intended to re-introduce the modern LA rock scene to both new and old material from the band. On October 30, 2010, Takara's new lineup performed their first live show to showcase new vocalist Jamie Kelli at Paladino's in Los Angeles, California. In May 2011 Takara announced they had begun work on their 7th studio album Wicked and Beautiful, also to be released by Progrock Records. The band describes the new material as a \\"strong taste of early, melodic Takara, mixed with a modern edge\\". Grusky stated that the band will also be simultaneously working to release a collection of rare and unreleased songs entitled Invitation to Faith, which will span entire the history of Takara. In October 2011 Takara announced they would be contributing a song to a Randy Rhoads/Ozzy Osbourne tribute album due to be released in the spring of 2012 by Versailles Records. Takara will be recording a version of the song \\"Little Dolls\\" from the 1981 album \\"Diary of a Madman\\".

It was released on October 3, 2006, by Carpark Records and in Europe by Bella Union. The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. The album had a remastered reissue in 2010 by HeartBreakBeat Records with a run limited to 1,000 copies on black vinyl. In 2012, a pressing on special edition white vinyl was released through Bella Union. In 2015, the band self-released a white cassette during the Depression Cherry tour. As of April 2012 Beach House has sold 24,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen Soundscan. The album was recorded on a 4-track over a two day period in Scally's basement.  Composition  The album has been described as an indie pop record with \\"shoegazer textures\\". Almost Cool said the band created an album of \\"lo-fi, hazy summer dream pop\\". The opening track, \\"Saltwater\\", is a lazy, drifting song built on scratchy, low-key synthetic beats that got \\"flooded with softly spreading guitar distortion and incandescent organ\\". \\"Master Of None\\" has a \\"more radiant synths and dreamy guitar rolling out over a slightly funkier rhythm.\\" \\"Auburn And Ivory\\" is a siren-song of 60's psychedelia and classical influences that's a duller, more stoney take on The Rolling Stones' \\"Play With Fire\\". \\"Childhood\\" is \\"the most upbeat song on the album, and it's one of the warmest.\\"  Critical reception  The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 14 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Pitchfork said the album evoked a \\"recipe of fairground waltzes, ghosted lullabies, and woodland hymnals\\" and compared the work of the duo to Mazzy Star, Spiritualized and Slowdive. AllMusic said the album is \\"one of the most mystical indie-pop surprises to arrive in 2006.\\" Giving the album a positive review, LAS Magazine said the album was made for \\"made for gray days indoors or late August afternoons spent lying in golden fields staring at blue skies,\\" while comparing it to Yo La Tengo's album And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out. Almost Cool said \\"it sounds like a late summer album, but it's just dark enough that I bet it will sound nice looking out the window to a dusting of snow on the ground as well.\\" Dusted Magazine said it is \\"a dream of an album.\\" Delusions of Adequacy said the album \\"is the perfect accompaniment for an introspective day, or night, of watching the globules of a lava lamp slowly float and sink.\\" = Accolades = The album was included at number sixteen in Pitchforks list of the top 50 albums of 2006.  Controversy  The band adapted \\"Snowdon Song\\" by 1960s folk group Tony, Caro, and John, changing the key, the time signature, and the lyrics and renaming it \\"Lovelier Girl\\" with the trio given no attribution. Four years after the album's release, the trio contacted them. After amicable discussions on copyright, the authorship of the \\"Lovelier Girl\\" version of the song is now jointly attributed to Beach House and Tony Dor√© of the trio. > \\"So we settled everything with them and they're fine and we're fine. We made > sure all the necessary royalties go to them and all that stuff, and they're > in the index as the co-writers,\\" Scally says. \\"We had no idea on our first > record that's how that thing worked. You don't know anything when you're > just kids in a basement making a record.\\"  In popular culture  The song \\"Master of None\\" was sampled by Canadian singer The Weeknd for his song \\"The Party & The After Party\\" off his 2011 debut mixtape House of Balloons. The song was also used in the Netflix show of the same name, as well as featuring in Miranda July's 2011 German-American drama film The Future.

Her work is rich in symbolism and mythology, displaying a rare technical virtuosity. About the Artist Self- portrait at 90 Judith Mason was born in Pretoria; South Africa, in 1938. She matriculated at the Pretoria High School for Girls in 1956. In 1960, she was awarded a BA Degree in Fine Arts at the University of the Witwatersrand. She taught painting at the University of the Witwatersrand, the University of Pretoria, the Michaelis School of Fine Art in Cape Town, Scuola Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, Italy from 1989 to 1991 and acted as external examiner for under-graduate and post-graduate degrees at Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Natal, Stellenbosch and Cape Town Universities. Several of Mason's works deal with the atrocities uncovered by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Temin, Christine (1999) \\"The art of truth and healing after apartheid, South African artists reflect the difficult past and challenging future\\", Boston Globe, 3 January 1991, p. C3 Mason died in White River 28 December 2016. Philosophy thumb Mason was politically aware and was motivated by a strong social conscience. Her work is informed by people, creatures, events and sometimes works of poetry, that touched or deeply disturbed her. Her images run the gamut from expressionist through representational, humorous and starkly symbolic. The history, mythology and ritual of Christianity and the eastern religions provided a fertile fund of inspiration for her work. Mason felt that formalised theology has destroyed the spiritually-nourishing mythological character of primitive religion. \\"Mason's pieces are sometimes imbued with lyrical and poetic overtones, and sometimes informed by the poetry of Christopher Smart and Wilfred Owen, another important feature of her work is the synthesis she established between beauty and ugliness. A beautifully drawn or painted face often gives way to a gaping, snarling monster ... The beauty/ugliness, or abjection, dichotomy in Mason's work is no other than an expression of how awful pain is. Mason also stated that \\"All the arts are forms of play.\\" \\"The Man Who Sang and The Woman Who Kept Silent' (colloquially known as 'The Blue Dress'); comprising three paintings and a mixed media sculpture, have together come to constitute the signature piece of the Constitutional Court's collection. Justice Albie Sachs considers Judith Mason's \\"The Man Who Sang and the Woman Who Kept Silent\\" (1998) to be \\"one of the great pieces of art in the world of the late 20th century\\" This piece was inspired by two stories Mason heard on the radio at the time of the Truth and Reconciliation hearings. They told of the execution of two liberation movement cadres by the security police. One was Harold Sefola, who as Mason relates, \\"asked permission to sing Nkosi Sikelel‚Äô iAfrika\\" before he was electrocuted; the other was Phila NdwandWe, \\"who was tortured and kept naked for ten days\\" and then assassinated in a kneeling position. As the TRC found, before NdwandWe was killed, she \\"fashioned a pair of panties for herself out of a scrap of blue plastic.\\" This moved Mason to make a dress of blue plastic bags, inscribed with text beginning: \\"Sister, a plastic bag may not be the whole armour of God, but you were wrestling with flesh and blood, and against powers, against the rulers of darkness ‚Ä¶\\" \\"I paint in order to make sense of my life, to manipulate various chaotic fragments of information and impulse into some sort of order, through which I can glimpse a hint of meaning. I am an agnostic humanist possessed of religious curiosity who regards making artworks as akin to alchemy. To use inert matter on an inert surface to convey real energy and presence seems to me a magical and privileged way of living out my days\\". Judith Mason, 2004 \\"Hyenas like artists, are scavengers prowling on the edge of society. I love hyaenas because of their other-worldly whooping, their ungainliness and their \\"bad hair\\" (I share the latter two characteristics). I also regard the animal as a very apt image of the 'id' in opposition to the ego and the super-ego, the monkey on my back. In the three lithographs I have depicted The Muse by Day as a Hyaena in guinea fowl's clothing, the spots as disguise or drag to celebrate the gift of mimicry. In the Muse by Night I have concentrated on the animal as far-seeing, seer-like with the coat of spots as shaman's eyes. In Muse Amused I have tried to celebrate a generally despised animal having an existential guffaw.\\" Judith Mason, 2006 Exhibitions Major retrospective: Judith Mason 'A Prospect of Icons' Standard Bank Gallery 2 ‚Äì ‚Äì 6 October December 2008 and Sasol Art Museum, University of Stellenbosch 14 January to March 2009.

The book was nominated for an Edgar Award and a Dilys Award. It was first published by Hutchinson in May 1994 n the UK, then in August that year by Putnam in the US. Plot The series stars Kathleen Mallory, a policewoman who is tall, blonde, beautiful, and green-eyed. She also has immense street and computer smarts. Her physical beauty masks a cold, amoral interior, however; O'Connell describes Mallory as a sociopath. New York City police detective Louis Markowitz picks up an 11-year-old homeless street urchin for stealing. Instead of arresting her, he takes Kathleen Mallory home and raises her as his own. Mallory (as she likes to be called) still deals with issues from her traumatic childhood, but she has an undying love (or at least the closest thing she can manage to it) for her adopted parents. She follows Louis to the police academy and ends up in the special crimes unit, specializing in computer research. Louis begins investigating the brutal murders of several older, wealthy women from Gramercy Park. While working alone and hot on the trail of this serial killer, he is murdered alongside another victim. Mallory takes it upon herself to take on this investigation (without police sanction, of course) and tries to piece together all the bits of information Louis had gathered. Louis trained Mallory well, but there is still the possibility that following his trail will cause Mallory to make the same mistakes he did, and lead to her becoming another victim. Along the line, Mallory uncovers a complicated plot that deals with magic, s√©ances, and insider trading.

Football has been a part of life for Iranians for many decades now and is played in schools, alleys, streets and football clubs nationwide. Women in Iran are increasingly inclined to play football, and with this increasing popularity it is only a matter of time before a more secure infrastructure develops. The Iran women's national football team competes internationally. Women are not allowed to attend men's football matches.Iran football ticket 'glitch' gave female fans hope - BBC, 4 September 2017 On 9 November 2018 Fatma Samoura, Secretary General of International Federation of Football Association FIFA said she would ask Iranian government to end ban on women‚Äôs entry to sport stadiums.FIFA To Engage With Iran To Lift Ban On Women In Stadiums Youth Olympics in Singapore History Women's football in Iran started in 1970. Women had the personal ambition of participating in male football competitions in alleys and streets, so they took part in some men's football games. During that time, when numerous trainers participated in the top grade of FIFA's training courses in Japan, they observed the Japan women's national football team's games against female teams from Korea, Singapore and India. That was the stimulus to the administrators of women‚Äôs football in Iran. Since 1970 serious measures were made in order to reach appropriate standards. Taj was the first club to train women. Thereafter, women took part first in football training and then in football teams such as Taj, Deyhim, Persepolis FC, Oghab FC and Khasram. By organizing different competitions between those teams, the best players were selected and placed in the first Iranian women's national team. This team was composed of former volleyball players, basketball players and athletes aged from 12 to 18. They started to train more seriously as sport magazine published the news of their progress, then gradually a huge number of female fans arose to support the team. With the help of educational institutions across the country, talented youngsters were scouted. As time went on, teams were selected, and eventually in 1971 a competition was organised by a women's sport magazine and the travel company Scandinavian Airlines System (S.A.S) under the supervision of the Football Federation, for that occasion the Italy women's national football team was invited to Iran and had two games against Taj and a team called Tehran in the Amjadieh stadium. Women's football continued to grow until the Iranian revolution in 1979. Recent In 1993, a rebound was made for women's football in Iran, in the shape of futsal, a form of indoor football, started by Alzahra University. At first it faced the refusal by the sport's administration, however because of the passion shown by the students towards football, the university changed the law and the first unofficial female competition was organized since the Iranian revolution. In this competition 10 teams participated, most of them belong to Alzahra University and the rest were from other national universities. Women's football activity continued to grow until finally, in 1997 the physical education organization formed a women's futsal committee and since then officially sport clubs have begun to encourage women's futsal teams in Iran. Since 2001, the first national female students' competition was officially organised under the supervision of the ministry of education, research and technology in Alzahra University. This competition was made by 12 teams from different universities. In 2004, subsequent efforts were not made to provide facilities for women. Occasionally female teams train with the hijab in stadiums in small groups on good quality pitches. An attempt has also been made to allow women into stadiums at the same time as men. To date, women football players are unable to train on pitches of good quality. Nowadays only indoor facilities are accessible to women footballers. Until 2005 many competitions have been organized with the participation of foreign teams. The Kowsar Women Football league is the primary women's football league in Iran.ÿ¨ÿØŸàŸÑ ŸÑŸä⁄Ø ÿ®ÿ±ÿ™ÿ± ÿ®ÿßŸÜŸàÿßŸÜ - ŸÑŸä⁄Ø ⁄©Ÿàÿ´ÿ± In 2015 for the first time in Iranian women's football history a national team qualified for the top continental competition. The U20 and the U17 team's qualified for the Asian Championships in China for their respective age groups. Revolution The football revolution (or soccer revolution) refers to the events in Iran which began 1997 in the context of football in that country. The idea of a \\"football revolution\\" is that the game itself can be used as a part of the secularization of Iran and frame women's rights movements in the country. = Background = While women's football in Iran has existed since 1970, female players are required to adhere to a strict dress code. Since the 1979 revolution and the establishment of the Islamic republic, women have had only restricted and segregated access to public places, and they have specifically been banned from attending men's sporting events.\\"Iran: Women At Sports Events: A Victory, But 'Not Enough'\\", Radio Liberty, April 24, 2006 = The 'soccer revolution' = When the Iranian football team narrowly defeated Australia in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification on November 29, 1997, millions of Iranians celebrated the victory by dancing and singing in the streets, despite multiple government warnings against any secular-type celebrations. The most notable event on that day was that women breached the police barrier and entered the stadium, from which they were banned. Some women even took off their veils. There was open socialization between men and women in the streets. The Western press saw these events as a message to Islamic fundamentalists in Iran.\\"The Veiled Threat\\", by Azar NafisiCourtney W. Howland (ed.) (1999) \\"Religious Fundamentalisms and the Human Rights of Women\\", , p. 265 When subsequently Iran defeated the United States 2-1 during the actual 1998 FIFA World Cup on June 21, 1998, similar celebrations continued several days, with some women taking off veils and mingling with men, until Iran's 2-0 defeat by Germany.FarsiNet News Archive Trying to open up stadiums to women to watch football was considered a form of social change. The idea was that football or soccer presented an alternative to Islamism through secular nationalism. Journalist Franklin Foer compared the football revolution with the Boston Tea Party.Franklin Foer (2004) How Soccer Explains the World: An Unlikely Theory of Globalization, , p. 221 Iranians themselves see football as a way to \\"ease diplomatic tension\\" or as a way to create social change within the country. = Legacy = Since then Iranian women's rights activists started fighting for the right to enter stadiums, often violently breaking into them.\\"President lifts ban on women watching football in Iran\\", The Guardian, April 25, 2006 A film by Jafar Panahi, Offside (2006), is about a group of young women who dress as boys in order to watch football at a stadium. In April 2006 president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lifted the ban on women entering stadiums despite the objections of conservatives, commenting that women and families help bring morality and chastity to public venues. However, the ban was reinstated by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on May 8, 2006. Further restrictions were enacted that enshrined the restrictions for international and national competitions. In December 2007 the vice president of the Iranian Olympic Committee, Abdolreza Savar, issued a memorandum to all sporting federations about the \\"proper behavior of male and female athletes\\" and that \\"severe punishment will be meted out to those who do not follow Islamic rules during sporting competitions\\" both local and abroad.Iran: Women excluded from sports in the name of Islam, Adnkrono, December 19, 2007; accessed September 21, 2008.

After playing for local amateur clubs, he made his professional debut for Glossop in 1901. He moved to Manchester City in 1904, becoming a prolific goalscorer for the club and winning a single cap for England in 1907. Early life Thornley was born in Whitfield, Derbyshire, the second of four children to Thomas Thornley and Henrietta Thornley (n√©e Cooper). His father worked as a butcher and his mother was a cotton weaver. His brother John would also become a footballer. As a teenager, he worked as a tripe dresser. Career Thornley began his football career playing for local amateur clubs Glossop Villa and Glossop St. James before joining Glossop in 1901. In April 1904, he joined First Division side Manchester City along with Frank Norgrove. Soon after the Football Association carried out an investigation into the transfer practices of the club and manager Tom Maley regarding making additional payments to players to avoid the maximum wage at the time. The investigation led to Maley receiving a life ban from the game and seventeen players were either fined or suspended. With a new squad hastily assembled, City met Arsenal soon after in a match played during a heatwave. With temperatures soaring, Thornley collapsed thirty minutes into the match and was described as \\"prostrate and very ill\\". City went on to lose four other players during the match due to the extreme heat, finishing the match with only six players. In his second season at the club, he scored 21 league goals in the First Division to finish as the club's top goalscorer, a feat which he achieved in three consecutive seasons afterwards. He received his first call-up for the England team in 1907, being named as a reserve player for a match against Ireland on 16 February 1907 before making his debut against Wales the following month. He also made two appearances for the Football League representative side. City were relegated in 1909 but won promotion from the Second Division at the first attempt by finishing the 1909‚Äì10 season as champions. In 1912, he was awarded a benefit match by the club that raised ¬£1,036, a record at the time for a player benefit match, before joining South Shields. He spent three seasons with South Shields playing in the North Eastern League, scoring 154 goals in 130 matches for the club including 70 in one season. Following the outbreak of World War I, Thornley joined the Royal Field Artillery at the age of 32 and served as a gunner until he was transferred to the army reserve in April 1917. He was discharged from the army in December 1918. His brother John, who played for Manchester United as an amateur, was killed during the war after succumbing to wounds he suffered during the Battle of St. Quentin during Operation Michael. When competitive football resumed after the war, Thornley played for Hamilton Academical and Houghton before retiring.

It premiered at the New York Film Festival, and invited to the Director's Fortnight program at the Cannes Film Festival. It is Egoyan's fourth feature film, and the first of his works to achieve international acclaim. The film has won 5 awards, as well as 2 other nominations upon its initial release. Egoyan based the film on a true story in 1989, when a fire burned down his parents' home. He realized how strange it could be for victims of a house fire to be emotionally dependent of insurance workers, which led to the inspiration for the project. Egoyan promoted a book named after the same title as his film, The Adjuster, at a launch in Ottawa. It is a film analysis written by Tom McSorley, a head of the Canadian Film Institute. This book is part of an examination of Canadian cinema, in a series for the University of Toronto press. It goes into intricate depth about The Adjuster, as he traces the genesis, production, and reception of the film. The author, McSorley, claims that it is a watershed film. Synopsis Insurance adjuster Noah Render (Elias Koteas) attempts to restore the damaged lives of his clients. His methods are unorthodox. He sleeps with most of them, puts them up in a designated hotel and quotes his profession's code like a mantra: \\"You may not know it yet, but you‚Äôre in shock.\\" When another plot line with Bubba and Mimi collides with the adjuster's, the story takes a surreal turn. This amoral yet compassionate protagonist, who lives with his film-censor wife (Arsin√©e Khanjian) is in a barren, unfinished suburban development. This film is one of Atom Egoyan's most strangely compelling creations. His effective use of wide- screen cinematography portrays the terrifying abyss that separates Noah from everyone he encounters. Selected cast  Reception  The film opens with general favorable reviews. Both Roger Ebert and New York Times' Janet Muslin gave positive reviews at the film's first release. It was selected as one of New York Times' Best 1000 Movies Ever Made. The film garnered several accolades. At the 17th Moscow International Film Festival it won the Special Silver St. George. It also won the Best Canadian Feature Film award at the 1991 Toronto International Film Festival; Egoyan accepted the award and trophy, but declined the $25,000 cheque that came with it, and instead donated the money to John Pozer, who had been the runner-up with his film The Grocer's Wife.Mark Bastien, \\"Film festival winner gives $25,000 away\\". Montreal Gazette, September 16, 1991. TIFF later ranked the film tenth place in its 1990s run of the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. (In the updated 2004 version it was replaced by another Egoyan film, 'The Sweet Hereafter, released in 1997, in the fourth place.) The Adjuster was awarded Best Canadian Film and Best Ontario Feature at the Sudbury Cin√©fest, the Special Jury Prize at the Moscow International Film Festival, and the Golden Spike at the Valladolid International Film Festival; all taken place in same year of its release in 1991.

The AWM was founded in 1971 and incorporated in the state of Massachusetts. AWM has approximately 5200 members, including over 250 institutional members, such as colleges, universities, institutes, and mathematical societies. It offers numerous programs and workshops to mentor women and girls in the mathematical sciences. Much of AWM's work is supported through federal grants. History The Association was founded in 1971 as the Association of Women Mathematicians, but the name was changed almost immediately. As reported in \\"A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents' Perspectives\\", by Lenore Blum: Mary Gray, an early organizer and first president, placed an advertisement in the February 1971 Notices of the AMS, and wrote the first issue of the AWM Newsletter that May. Early goals of the association focused on equal pay for equal work, as well as equal consideration for admission to graduate school and support while there; for faculty appointments at all levels; for promotion and for tenure; for administrative appointments; and for government grants, positions on review and advisory panels and positions in professional organizations. Alice T. Shafer who succeeded Mary Gray as second president of the AWM, set up an AWM office at Wellesley College. At this point, AWM began to be a recognized established presence in the mathematics scene. The AWM holds an annual meeting at the Joint Mathematics Meetings. In 2011, during its fortieth-anniversary celebration 40 Years and Counting, the association initiated a biennial research symposium . Lectures The AWM sponsors three honorary lecture series. * The Noether Lectures ‚Äì honor women who \\"have made fundamental and sustained contributions to the mathematical sciences\\". Presented in association with the American Mathematical Society, the lecture is given at the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings. * The Falconer Lectures ‚Äì honor women who \\"have made distinguished contributions to the mathematical sciences or mathematics education. Presented in association with the Mathematical Association of America, the lecture is given at the annual MathFest. * The Kovalevsky Lectures ‚Äì honor women who have \\"made distinguished contributions in applied or computational mathematics\\". Presented in association with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), the lecture is given at the SIAM Annual Meeting.

Opposing the WFM were associations of mine owners and businessmen at each location, supported by the Colorado state government. The strikes were notable and controversial for the accompanying violence, and the imposition of martial law by the Colorado National Guard in order to put down the strikes. A nearly simultaneous strike in Colorado's northern and southern coal fields was also met with a military response by the Colorado National Guard.Morris Friedman, The Pinkerton's labor spy, Wilshire book co., 1907, pages 156-170 Colorado's most significant battles between labor and capital occurred between miners and mine operators. In these battles the state government, with one exception, sided with the mine operators. Additional participants have included the National Guard, often informally called the militia; private contractors such as the Pinkertons, Baldwin‚ÄìFelts, and Thiel detective agencies; and various labor entities, Mine Owners' Associations, and vigilante groups and business-dominated groups such as the Citizens' Alliance. The WFM strikes considered part of the Colorado labor wars include: * Colorado City, March to April 1903, and July 1903 to June 1904 * Cripple Creek mining district, March to April 1903, and August 1903 to June 1904 * Idaho Springs, May to September 1903 * Telluride, September to December 1903 * Denver, July to November 1903 * Durango, August to September 1903 Two scholars of American labor violence concluded, \\"There is no episode in American labor history in which violence was as systematically used by employers as in the Colorado labor war of 1903 and 1904.\\"Philip Taft and Philip Ross, \\"American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome,\\" The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed.

Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, George G. Suggs, Jr., 1972.p.15 =Early victory in Cripple Creek= In January 1894, mine owners tried to lengthen the workday for Cripple Creek miners from eight to ten hours without raising pay. This action provoked a strike by the miners. In response, mine owners brought in strike breakers. The miners intimidated the strike breakers, so the mine owners raised a private army of an estimated 1,200 armed men. The gunmen were deputized by El Paso County Sheriff F. M. Bowers.p.19 The miners were also armed, and were prepared for a confrontation. Colorado Governor Davis Waite convinced the mine owners to go back to the shorter workday in what was called the \\"Waite agreement.\\"p.19 Governor Waite also called out the state militia to disarm the 1,200 gunmen who were no longer taking orders from the sheriff. The Waite agreement on miners' hours and wages subsequently went into effect, and lasted nearly a decade.p.19-20 =WFM builds power= Big Bill Haywood, the powerful Secretary Treasurer of the Western Federation of Miners. Downtown Cripple Creek was destroyed by fires in 1896. Carpenters and other construction workers rushed to the area to rebuild the city, and unions arose to organize them. The carpenter's union and other unions owed their leverage to the Western Federation of Miners.All That Glitters--Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998.p.62 The strike victory in 1894 enabled the WFM to build labor organizations at the district, state, and regional levels. Mining companies acted on a concern about miners stealing high grade ore by hiring Pinkerton guards. In one case three hundred miners walked out to protest the policy, the company negotiated, and the Pinkerton guards were replaced by guards nominated by the union. The new agreement stipulated that miners suspected of theft would be searched by a fellow miner in the presence of a watchman. To ensure a cooperative work force, mine managers and superintendents found it useful to urge all miners to join the union.p.71-74 El Paso County included both heavily working class Cripple Creek and more conservative Colorado Springs, home to many of the mine owners. Backed by the pro-union Victor and Cripple Creek Daily Press, the unions elected union members to public office, and split the mining district from El Paso County, by creating Teller County.p.69 Teller County was a union county where the eight-hour workday was enforced, and workers were paid union scale. Unions used social pressure, boycotts, and strikes to ensure that union goals were enforced. The unions were powerful enough to simply announce wages and hours, and any businesses that failed to comply were boycotted. Non-union products were eliminated from saloons and grocery stores.p.70 =WFM turns to socialism= Outside the Cripple Creek District, however, things were not going well for the WFM. The union had lost a strike in Leadville in 1896, and in 1899 there was another confrontation at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho which ended with hundreds of union miners locked up by the militia in temporary prisons. WFM Secretary-Treasurer Bill Haywood concluded that the companies and their supporters in government were conducting class warfare against the working class.p.55 At their 1901 convention the WFM delegates proclaimed that a \\"complete revolution of social and economic conditions\\" was \\"the only salvation of the working classes.\\"p.179 WFM leaders openly called for the abolition of the wage system. By the spring of 1903 the WFM was the most militant labor organization in the country.p.15 This was a considerable change from the WFM's founding Preamble, which envisioned a future of arbitration and conciliation with employers, and an eventual end to the need for strikes.p.23 =Craft versus industrial unionism= Bill Haywood, the WFM's powerful secretary treasurer and second in command, had adopted the industrial unionism philosophy of his mentor, former WFM leader Ed Boyce. Boyce disagreed with Samuel Gompers, head of the AFL, over union organization.p.23 Haywood thought that unions should cover whole industries, and that the WFM should extend to workers at ore processing mills as well, and that all workers in an industrial union should stand up for the rights of other workers. Haywood believed he had the necessary weapon to force the mill owners to negotiate: the solidarity of the workers in the mines that fed the mills.p.60,79 Under the leadership of Ed Boyce, Cripple Creek unions also helped to organize, and provided leadership for the Western Labor Union, a federation formed in response to the American Federation of Labor (AFL) which had federated the craft unions in the east. In 1899, the WFM wrote industrial unionism, its response to the AFL's craft philosophy, into its charter.p.63,68 Anti-union forces in Colorado Colorado's employers observed the WFM's socialist pronouncements with trepidation, because the union's goal was now the elimination of private ownership of the mines.p.28 Republican James Peabody ran a campaign for governor of Colorado pledging to restore a conservative government which would be responsive to business and industry. He nonetheless expressed warm sentiments toward unionism while campaigning in the Cripple Creek District. Labor organizations were not persuaded and opposed his candidacy, but the Republicans gained control of the state governmentp.39-41 when the Democrats and Populists split the progressive ticket.p.201 Peabody saw the Western Federation of Miners as a threat to his own class interests, to private property, to democratic institutions, and to the nation itself. He promised in his inaugural address to make Colorado safe for investments, if necessary using all the power of the state to accomplish his aims.p.45 =National employers' movement= A national employers' movement aimed directly at the power of unions was gaining strength. In his 1972 book Colorado's War On Militant Unionism, George Suggs, Jr. reported that antiunion employers' organizations in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin had effectively stopped the growth of unions through open shop campaigns.p.65-66 In 1903, David M. Parry delivered a speech at the annual convention of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) that was a diatribe against organized labor. He argued that unions' goals would result in \\"despotism, tyranny, and slavery.\\" Parry advocated the establishment of a great national anti-union federation under the control of the NAM, and the NAM responded by initiating such an effort. =Colorado employers' movement= Among those present at the Chicago conference was President James C. Craig of the Citizens' Alliance of Denver.p.68 Within three weeks after its creation on April 9, the Citizens' Alliance of Denver had enrolled nearly 3,000 individual and corporate members, and had a war chest of nearly $20,000. The Citizens' Alliance of Denver believed in the principle of an employer's absolute control over the management of business. Craig led the fight against union labor throughout Colorado.p.68 The organization had a \\"clandestine character,\\" and all the inner workings of the organization were enshrouded \\"in deep secrecy,\\" raising the possibility that \\"the group might take extralegal action against all organized labor.\\"p.69\\"This association is secret, and its deliberations shall be held confidential, and its name shall be The Citizens' Alliance of Denver, Colorado...\\" Article I, Citizens' Alliance Constitution, as recorded in A Report on Labor Disturbances in the State of Colorado, from 1880 to 1904, Carroll D. Wright, Commissioner of Labor, January 27, 1905, page 46. The alliance stepped into the middle of labor disputes, and one of their early accomplishments was preventing amicable settlements between companies and their unions.p.70 Other employers' alliances in Colorado followed the constitutional formula of the Citizens' Alliance of Denver.p.69 =Pinkerton detectives= Pinkerton Detective Agency detective James McParland, seen here some time in the 1880s. James McParland, famous for his role in prosecuting the Molly Maguires years earlier in Pennsylvania, ran the Denver Pinkerton office. He directed the activities of scores of spies that had been placed within the Western Federation of Miners.p.89 Charles MacNeill, general manager of the USRRC refining company, had been a Pinkerton client since 1892.p.327 Eight-hour day issue The agreement settling the 1894 strike in the Cripple Creek District provided an eight-hour day for miners.Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997.p.219 The WFM argued that working long hours in a mine or smelter were hazardous to workers' health, and that the eight hour day should become state law for mine and mill workers. Republicans opposed the law, and sought an opinion from the Colorado Supreme Court. The Court advised that such a law would be unconstitutional.p.219 Then a similar law was passed in Utah, and it withstood a U.S. Supreme Court challenge. Legislators used the precise language from the Utah law in the legislation. The Colorado Supreme Court again ruled that the law was unconstitutional, this time with respect to the state constitution. It would take an amendment to the Colorado Constitution to satisfy the Colorado high court.p.219 The amendment to the Colorado Constitution was endorsed by the Republican, Democratic, and Populist parties. The Colorado State Legislature put the matter to a referendum, which submitted to voters.p.219 On November 4, 1902, Colorado voters passed the amendment 72,980 to 26,266, an approval rate of greater than 72 percent.p.218-219 The new law, with the force of a state constitutional amendment, had only to go back to the state legislature in the 1903 session for final implementation. Under pressure from mining companies,p.219-220 the Colorado state government ignored the results of the referendum, and did not pass the enabling legislation.p.65 Governor Peabody, elected with pro-business support, had the opportunity to rescue the amendment, but opted not to do so. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt would write that Peabody's failure to pass an 8-hour law was \\"a grave error\\" and \\"unpardonable.\\"p.218-219 Strike in Idaho Springs, May to August 1903 In Idaho Springs, WFM miners struck in May 1903 for an eight-hour day. In July, a dynamite attack in the middle of the night destroyed the powerhouse at the Sun and Moon mine, where strikebreakers were working. The attackers fled, leaving behind a union miner mortally injured by a premature dynamite explosion. A number of union officials were arrested that same night, and accused of complicity in the bombing.p.76 On the night after the dynamite attack, The following night, nearly 500 people, including most businessmen and city officials, met to decide on a response. After angry speeches, the crowd marched to the jail, removed the prisoners and expelled 23 union members from the town. Suggs wrote that the Citizen's Protective League, > \\"directed law enforcement, held secret strategy sessions, ordered the arrest > and interrogation of suspects whom they held incommunicado, watched incoming > trains, and warned union sympathizers to leave town.\\"p.77 Although this was a \\"brazen, illegal exercise of power,\\"p.77 Governor Peabody ignored it.p.79 District Judge Frank W. Owers ruled the expulsions illegal, and issued an injunction against the League to prevent interference with the return of the union miners. Eight WFM members returned to Idaho Springs, were arrested and tried for the powerhouse explosion, and were acquitted. Owers then issued bench warrants for 129 of the Citizens' Protective League vigilantes, charging them with \\"rioting and making threats and assaults.\\" The district attorney had cooperated with the League, and refused to prosecute the warrants.p.79 Durango smelter strike, August and September 1903 The Western Federation of Miners local at Durango, Colorado, ordered a strike on 29 August 1903. Out of the 200 employees of the Durango smelter, 175 walked off, demanding an 8-hour day. The strike effectively stopped work at the smelter for several days, but the smelter replaced the strikers, and resumed normal operation. Extra deputies were hired, and arrangements made to house workers on the smelter grounds. The strike failed.James Cowie and W. H. Montgomery, Ninth Biennial Report of the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the State of Colorado, 1903-1904, 1904, p78-79. First Colorado City mill workers strike, March and April 1903 The \\"Last Dollar\\" and other mines, Independence, Colorado, 1904. In August 1902, the WFM organized the mill workers of Colorado City, who refined the ore brought down from the Cripple Creek District. The mill operators hired Pinkerton detective A.H. Crane to infiltrate and spy upon the local union. Crane became \\"rather influential\\" in the union, and forty-two union men were fired. It was \\"practically admitted\\" that the dismissals were simply for joining the union.Benjamin McKie Rastall, \\"The labor history of the Cripple Creek district,\\" Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin, Feb. 1908, n.198.p.73 Charles MacNeill, vice-president and general manager of the United States Reduction and Refining Company (USRRC), refused to negotiate with the union,p.200 declining even to accept a document with the union's list of demands. The demands were the rehiring of the union workers, the right to organize, and a wage increase.p.47 Thwarted in their efforts to negotiate, the mill workers went on strike on February 14 to protest the dismissals. When other mills also declined to accept the union's terms, they were struck as well. There was close cooperation between the mill operators and El Paso County law enforcement. General Manager MacNeill received an appointment as deputy sheriff, and for a time the USRRC paid the salaries of additional deputies protecting its properties. Limited production continued with non-union workers,p.47 and strike-breakers were hired with the understanding that their jobs were permanent. Tensions mounted on the picket line, and the sheriff appointed more than seventy men for strike duty. But MacNeill was demanding 250 guards for the USRRC properties alone. W.R. Gilbert, sheriff of El Paso County, requested troops from the governor, writing: \\"It has been brought to my attention that men have been severely beaten, and there is grave danger of destruction of property. I accordingly notify you of the existence of a mob, and armed bodies of men are patrolling the territory, from which there is a danger of commission of felony.\\"p.91 Historian Benjamin Rastall declared that there was \\"No apparent necessity for the presence of troops... Colorado City was quiet... No destruction of property had occurred, and 65 deputies would seem an ample number.\\"p.76 Gilbert later testified that the troops were necessary not to suppress existing violence, but to prevent it. The investigation revealed enormous pressure on the sheriff from the refining companiesp.48 to secure state troops. =Governor sends in troops= More than three hundred National Guard soldiers arrived in Colorado City to protect the mills, and escort non-union employees to and from work.p.50 The Colorado City mayor, the chief of police, and the city attorney complained to the governor in a letter that \\"there is no disturbance here of any kind.\\" At least 600 citizens of Colorado City opposed the deployment by signing petitions or sending wires to the governor stating, for example, that \\"a few occasional brawls\\" did not justify military occupation. But the soldiers dispersed union pickets. They searched union member's homes and they put the union hall under surveillance.p.77 Governor Peabody worked in close association with Craig to form an employer-based citizens' alliance for his home town of Canon City, which the governor later joined.p.80 He appointed an anti-union mine manager and former sheriff's deputyp.80 from the Cripple Creek District, Sherman Bell, to the office of adjutant general,p.80 For secretary of Colorado's state military board, Peabody appointed John Q. MacDonald, manager of the Union smelter at Florence, part of the USRRC, the company in the middle of a Western Federation of Miners strike. Peabody appointed two aides-de-camp, Spencer Penrose and Charles M. MacNeill, who were, respectively, treasurer and vice-president/general manager of the USRRC.p.82-83 Peabody described MacNeill and Penrose as his two \\"Colorado Springs Colonels.\\"p.200 First Cripple Creek strike, March 1903 The WFM asked all mines not to sell ore to the ore mills in Colorado City, with the understanding that the union would call a strike at any mine not cooperating. The mine owners met on 5 March 1903, and refused to stop selling ore to the struck mills. The businessmen of Victor convinced the WFM to delay the strike one week, to see if the mill strike could be negotiated without the strike spreading to the mines. On 14 March, the union locals at Cripple Creek declared a strike against 12 mines shipping ore to the Colorado Reduction and Refining mills, and 750 miners walked out. By this time, the Portland and Telluride mills had signed agreements with the union. Two mines, the Vindicator and Mary McKinney agreed not to sell ore to the struck mills, and were not struck. Some mines had contracts with the struck mills, and could not stop shipping ore without incurring legal penalties. The governor spoke to representatives of the union, but he simultaneously sought information about obtaining \\"an allotment of Krag guns,\\" because \\"a serious strike was imminent.\\"p.203 =Governor Peabody brokers an agreement= Governor Peabody invited both sides to meet in the governor's office on 14 March. Manager MacNeill walked out of the negotiations, but the Portland mill and Telluride mill signed agreements to hire back fired union members, and not to discriminate against union members going forward. The strikes against those two mills were called off, but those against the two Colorado Reduction and Refining mills continued. The governor agreed to withdraw the National Guard troops. Manager MacNeill finally succumbed to the governor's arm-twisting, and verbally promised not to discriminate against union workers in the future. The strikes in both Colorado City and Cripple Creek were called off. On 1 May, after the strike had ended, the WFM negotiated a wage increase for the mill workers at the Portland and Telluride mills. Wages of $1.80 per day for the lowest-paid workers increased to $2.25. Again, the mills of the Colorado Reduction and Refining Company held out, and refused to increase wages. Denver mill workers' strike, July 1903 Western Federation of Miners union members working at the Grant and Globe smelters in Denver proposed a reduction in the work day from the existing 10 or 12 hours down to 8. American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO), which owned the smelters, refused. On 3 July 1903, at a meeting of the local also attended by national officers Charles Moyer and Bill Haywood, the mill workers voted to strike. The strikers immediately went to the Grant smelter and ordered the employees to quit working. They then went to the Globe smelter and did likewise; 5 or 6 workers at the Globe smelter were beaten and kicked by the strikers. By the time the company manager learned of the strike, the smelters were closed and the fires extinguished. The strikers forced three of the furnaces to shut down so quickly that molten metal congealed in the pipes, requiring laborious repair work.p.132-137 The number of workers idled at the two smelters was 773, about half of whom were union members. The union established pickets at the two smelters, in spite of a court injunction against picketing. On 7 July, the Globe smelter brought back 20 employees to do repair work caused when the furnaces were extinguished unexpectedly, while a police force of 31 guarded both plants. The picketing remained peaceful, and the police guards were withdrawn on 21 July. p.137-143 WFM members at ASARCO's Eiler smelter in Pueblo made the same demand for 8-hour days, but agreed to keep working when management agreed to grant to its Pueblo employees any concessions won by the WFM strikers in Denver. Likewise the owners of the Argo smelter in Denver agreed to match any concessions by the Grant or Globe smelters p.144-146 On 19 July, Asarco brought 62 workers from Missouri to Denver, but when they learned of the strike, all but 20 left town. The Grant smelter had out-of-date equipment, and the company decided to keep it closed. But in mid-August, ASARCO restarted its Globe smelter. Striking employees were re-hired only if they declared that they had quit the union.p.143-144 On Thanksgiving Day 1903, a crowd of strikers attacked 7 workers at the Globe smelter, also badly beating a policeman who came to their aid. Nine of the assailants were tried and sentenced to 6 months in jail. The strike was never officially called off.p.145 One Pinkerton spy was assigned to sabotage the union's relief program during a strike. According to Bill Haywood, Secretary-Treasurer of the WFM, the man at first overpaid strike benefits, and then distributed insufficient food for the miners' families.The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William D. Haywood, 1929, pages 157-58. Second Colorado City mill workers' strike, July 1903 MacNeill hired back most of the strikers, but they were offered different, less satisfactory jobs than they'd held before. MacNeill had promised to rehire all but fourteen union members, yet forty-two WFM members were not rehired. Some union men refused the proffered jobs because they had once belonged to other union men who were not re-hired. The union felt that MacNeill had acted in bad faith. On 3 July 1903, the WFM struck the two ore processing mills of the Colorado Reduction and Refining Co. Only nine men walked out. Although the Telluride mill had increase wages on 1 May, on 5 July the company announced that it was cutting back part of the increase. Under the new schedule, the lowest-paid position, which had recently increased from $1.80 to $2.25 per day, would be cut back to $2.00 per day. On 25 August 1903, Walter Keene, the head precipitator at the Telluride mill was attacked by a crowd of union members inside the mill, hit on the head with a dinner pail, and his life threatened if he did not either join the union or quit his job. Keene promptly resigned. H. W. Fullerton, the manager of the Telluride mill fired two of Keene's assailants, and told the union that violence against non-union employees would not be tolerated. He reminded them that he had agreed in writing not to discriminate against union men, and expected the union likewise not to harass non-union employees. The union demanded that Fullerton rehire the two men he had fired, and when he refused, the WFM struck the Telluride mill.p.76 Second Cripple Creek miners' strike, August 1903 View of Cripple Creek, 1900. The WFM again tried to shut down the mines supplying ore to the struck mills in Colorado City. But this time, the leadership decided on a massive show of union force. Rather than strike just the mines supplying ore to the struck mills, as before, on 8 August, the WFM shut down the entire mining district, declaring strikes at about 50 mines, and idling 3,500 workers.p.205 Although the union had no issue with mine owners, the WFM hoped that a larger strike would put more pressure on mill owners to settle.p.76 The Cripple Creek district had been a union stronghold for the Western Federation of Miners since its success in the strike of 1894, and it seemed a safe base from which to expand union power into the ore processing mills. The strike had been called by the district council of the WFM, representing the leaders of the various WFM union locals around the mining district. A recent change in the WFM constitution gave union leadership the right to call strikes in support of other locals without a strike vote, and the rank and file were not given the opportunity to vote on the strike. A large majority of the union miners were said to be opposed to the strike; Rastall estimated up to 90 percent were against.p.89 The WFM hoped to win the strike by having the mine owners pressure mill operators to settle.p.86 However, although some mine owners wanted the mills to accept WFM demands, the Cripple Creek Mine Owners' Association preempted defections, declaring that the dispute with the mills should not have caused a strike of mines in the Cripple Creek District.p.206 That argument by the CCMOA resonated with many of the union miners, who had given up their right to vote on strikes individually in their convention,p.85 and may have privately had second thoughts. But the maverick owner of the Portland mine, who had come to terms with the union five months earlier over the mill workers' strike, once again broke ranks with the other mine/mill operators and came to an agreement with the WFM. Five hundred miners returned to work,p.85 giving hope to the WFM leadership. The WFM wielded tremendous economic leverage in the Cripple Creek District.p.86 But merchants were concerned that the union seemed willing to hold the local economy hostage for the sake of mill workers outside the district. The concept of industrial unionism may have been obvious to union miners, but it wasn't a persuasive philosophy to their creditors. Many of the merchants announced that they would sell only for cash, cutting off credit for miners on strike. Then Craig arrived to help the merchants establish the Cripple Creek District Citizens' Alliance, with about five hundred businessmen and others joining up in the first week.p.88 By the end of August 1903 the entire district was polarized and tense, with any chance for a settlement rapidly slipping away. Mine owners and businessmen had concluded that the central issue of the strike was who would control the district,p.89 and they were reluctant to give up any of the control that they had. Several incidents occurred in the Cripple Creek District, some strike related. A union member's house burned, and so did the shaft-house at the Sunset-Eclipse mine. Some individuals were beaten. Sheriff Henry Robertson, a member of the WFM, deputized guards for the mines, their salaries provided by the mine operators. The sheriff saw no reason to request state support, insisting that he was investigating the crimes. The county commissionersp.89 and the mayor of Cripple Creek supported the sheriff. The mine owners disagreed, and so did Mayor French of nearby Victor, who was manager of the C.C.C. Sampler.p.94 Notable labor organizer, Mary \\"Mother\\" Jones, was ordered to be kept out of the state by the governor. She managed to enter in order to aid the strike, and she wrote a letter to Governor Peabody saying, \\"I wish to notify you, governor, that you don't own the state. When it was admitted to the sisterhood of the states, my fathers gave me a share of stock in it; and that is all they gave you. The civil courts are open. If I break a law of state or nation it is the duty of the civil courts to deal with me. That is why my forefathers established those courts to keep dictators and tyrants such as you from interfering with civilians.\\" =National Guard sent to Cripple Creek= Although business interests had supported National Guard intervention in Colorado City,p.50 Governor Peabody hesitated to send the guard to Cripple Creek. WFM President Charles Moyer had portrayed the Colorado City intervention as unnecessary,p.90 and certainly many had seen it that way.p.50 Peabody appointed three individuals to an investigative team, two of whom had already recommended intervention.p.91 The union was not consulted during their investigation, and, among those consulted, only Sheriff Robertson and Mayor Shockey spoke out against intervention. The commission concluded that a \\"reign of terror\\" existed in the district, and intervention was justified. The Cripple Creek Mine Owners' Association agreed to secretly finance the troops.p.92-93 By the end of September 1903 nearly a thousand soldiers were guarding the Cripple Creek District mines and patrolling the roads. As in Colorado City, the civil authorities and a large number of citizens in the Cripple Creek District deplored the intervention. The county commissioners unanimously condemned it. The Victor city council claimed that Mayor French had deliberately misrepresented conditions and the wishes of his constituents when he supported intervention. Sheriff Robertson declared that the governor had exceeded his authority. Mass meetings and demonstrations opposed the decision.p.94 More than two thousand signatures were collected on petitions protesting the action.p.207 The CCMOA, the Cripple Creek Citizens' Alliance, and other employers' associations supported the action.p.94 The goal of the employers' organizations was not just ending the strike, but terminating the influence of the union. The CCMOA announced plans to sweep the WFM from the district.p.27 Peabody facilitated that goal in his orders to Sherman Bell, which directed the National Guard to assume the responsibilities of the local sheriff and civil officials. =Military rule= General Sherman Bell. Photo from The Pinkerton Labor Spy, published in 1907. In her 1998 book All That Glitters, historian Elizabeth Jameson quoted a Pinkerton detective reporting that there was \\"no radical talk or threats of any kind that I can hear, on the part of the miners.\\"p.207-208 But the National Guard leaders were ready for war. A thousand Krag-Jorgensen rifles and sixty thousand rounds of ammunition were sent to the district.p.210 Sherman Bell, the former mine manager and leader of the Guard forces declared: \\"I came to do up this damned anarchistic federation.\\" Another Guard officer, Thomas McClellend, said: \\"To hell with the constitution, we aren't going by the constitution.\\" Bell justified his actions as a \\"military necessity, which recognizes no laws, either civil or social.\\"p.207 Sherman Bell supplemented his state salary with $3,200 annual pay from the mine owners.p.62 Rastall wrote that Bell returned a hero from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, but lost popularity because of his \\"overbearing ways and self-conceit.\\"p.157 George Suggs observed, > Using force and intimidation to shut off debate about the advisability of > the state's intervention, Brigadier General John Chase, Bell's field > commander, systematically imprisoned without formal charges union officials > and others who openly questioned the need for troops. Included among those > jailed were a justice of the peace, the Chairman of the Board of County > Commissioners, and a member of the WFM who had criticized the guard and > advised the strikers not to return to the mines.p.95 > So frequently were individuals placed in the military stockade or \\"bull pen\\" > at Goldfield for reasons of \\"military necessity\\" and for \\"talking too much\\" > in support of the strike that the Cripple Creek Times of September 15 > advised its readers not to comment on the strike situation. Not even the > newspapers escaped harassment. When the Victor Daily Record, a strong voice > of the WFM, erroneously charged that one of the soldiers was an ex-convict, > its staff was imprisoned before a retraction could be published.p.96 While Victor Daily Record editor George Kyner and four printers were in the bullpen, Emma Langdon, a Linotype typesetting machine operator married to one of the imprisoned printers, sneaked into the Daily Record office and barricaded herself inside. She printed the next edition of the paper, and then delivered it to the prisoners in the bullpen,p.209 surprising the guards in the process. On September 10 the National Guard began \\"a series of almost daily arrests\\" of union officers and men known to be strongly in sympathy with the unions.p.80 When District Judge W. P. Seeds of Teller County held a hearing on writs of habeas corpus for four union men held in the stockade, Sherman Bell responded: \\"Habeas corpus be damned, we'll give 'em post mortems.\\"p.62 Approximately ninety cavalrymen entered Cripple Creek and surrounded the courthouse. The prisoners were escorted into the courtroom by a company of infantry equipped with loaded rifles and fixed bayonets,p.101 and the soldiers remained standing in a line during the court sessions. Other soldiers took up sniper positions and set up a gatling gun in front of the courthouse. Angered by the intimidating display, an attorney for the prisoners refused to proceed and left the court.p.97 Undaunted by the military presence, the judge ruled for the prisoners. Judge Seeds commente: > I trust that there will never again be such an unseemly and unnecessary > intrusion of armed soldiers in the halls and about the entrances of American > Courts of Justice. They are intrusions that can only tend to bring this > court into contempt, and make doubtful the boasts of that liberty that is > the keynote of American Government.Friedman, Morris, The Pinkerton Labor > Spy, Wilshire Book Co., New York, 1907, page 77. Yet Chase refused to release the men until Governor Peabody ordered him to do so. Even those Colorado newspapers which had supported the intervention expressed concern that court orders were not being obeyed by the National Guard.p.98 The Army and Navy Journal editorialized that using the Colorado National Guard in such a biased way \\"was a rank perversion of the whole theory and purpose of the National Guard.\\"p.99 The Colorado Constitution of the period \\"declares that the military shall always be in strict subordination to the civil power.\\"p.101 The district court ruled that Bell and Chase should be arrested for violating the law. Bell responded by declaring that no civil officer would be allowed to serve civil processes to any National Guard officer on duty. Within a week after the arrival of troops, the Findley, Strong, Elkton, Tornado, Thompson, Ajax, Shurtloff, and Golden Cycle mines began operations again, and recruited replacement workers brought in from outside the district. The mine owners recruited from surrounding states, not telling potential miners that there was a strike. When they arrived and learned of the strike, some were \\"practically forced\\" to go to work. Emil Peterson, a worker recruited from Duluth, ran when he realized the purpose of the military escort. Lieutenant Hartung fired a pistol at him as he ran. A warrant for the lieutenant was ignored by the military officers.p.102 The CCMOA began to pressure companies to fire union miners who were still working in mines that had not been struck. Companies that refused to do so, or who in some other way refused to join the employers' alliance movement, were blacklisted.p.107-115 When the Woods Investment Company ordered their employees to quit the WFM, the employees joined the strike instead. The superintendent and the shift bosses accompanied all of the workers out the door.p.209 =Plot to derail a train= A railroad track walker had discovered missing spikes.p.210 The incident at first appeared to be an attempt to wreck a train carrying strike breakers to non-union mines.p.69 A former member of the WFM by the name of H.H. McKinney was arrested and confessed to K.C. Sterling, a detective employed by the Mine Owners' Association, and D.C. Scott, a detective for the railroad, that he had pulled the spikes. McKinney implicated the president of District Union No. 1, the president of the Altman local, and a WFM activist in an alleged conspiracy to wreck the train. But then McKinney repudiated his confession by writing a second confession, stating that he had been promised a pardon, immunity, a thousand dollars, and a ticket to wherever he and his wife wanted to go, to \\"any part of the world,\\" if he would lie about the spikes. He didn't know who had pulled them, and the first confession had been brought to him, already prepared, while he was in the jail.p.210 McKinney and his wife were then given new suits of clothing, and he was granted unusual privileges, allowed to spend time away from the jail for free meals and to see his wife. A trial was held for the three union men, and McKinney changed his story again, this time asserting that his original confession was true, and that the repudiation was false. He testified that he didn't know who paid for the meals and clothes.p.105-106 But some of the testimony in the trial implicated the detectives who had arrested McKinney, and suggested that the detectives pulled the spikes, intending to blame the union. One of the two arresting detectives admitted to being employed by the CCMOA for secret work, and a third detective confessed to helping plot the derailing. One of the detectives had also been seen with another man working on the railroad tracks.p.211p.70 McKinney testified he would be willing to kill two hundred or more people for five hundred dollars.p.107 In his autobiography, Bill Haywood, the secretary treasurer of the Western Federation of Miners, stated that the president of the Victor Miners' Union and many other union men were on the train.The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William D. Haywood, 1929, pages 142-143. Rastall agrees with Haywood on this point, there were union men on the train. Haywood charged that McKinney had also worked with a third detective named (Charles) Beckman, from the Thiel Detective Service Company. Beckman had worked undercover as a member of Victor Miners Union No. 32 since April. His wife was an undercover member of the union's Ladies' Auxiliary.p.211 Additional testimony indicated that Detective Scott inquired of a railroad engineer named Rush, where would be the worst place for a train wreck. Rush pointed out the high bridge where, if a rail was pulled, the train would crash three or four hundred feet down an embankment, killing or injuring all on the train. Scott told Rush to be on the lookout for damaged track that night at that spot. Later that evening Rush stopped his train, walked ahead on the track and discovered that spikes had been pulled.The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William D. Haywood, 1929. Sterling admitted in his testimony that the three detectives had tried to induce WFM members to derail the train.p.211 But in Bill Haywood's perception, Detectives Sterling and Scott put all the blame on McKinney and Detective Beckman. A jury of non-union ranchers and timbermen unanimously found the three union men \\"not guilty.\\"p.70 McKinney was allowed to go free on the train-wrecking charge, but was later arrested for perjury. He was released on $300 bond, which the Mine Owners' Association covered.p.211 Detectives Sterling, Scott, and Beckman were never arrested. Telluride strike, September 1903 WFM members walked out of the ore processing mills at Telluride on 1 September 1903, for a reduction in the workday from 12 hours to 8. The mill shutdowns caused a shutdown of most of the mines which had no place to send their ore to be processed. The ore mill for the Tom Boy mine tried to reopen with a nonunion workforce, but the WFM struck the mine, and posted picketers armed with pistols and rifles around the Tom Boy‚Äôs mine yard, preventing strikebreakers from entering.Carrol D. Wright, \\"A Report on Labor Disturbances in the State of Colorado,\\" Senate Document No. 122, 58th Congress, 3rd Session, 1905. In November, mine owners at Telluride made several requests that the governor send in national guard troops. There were no disturbances, but the owners wanted to reopen the mines with strikebreakers, and wanted national guard protection. The governor sent a committee of five led by the attorney general. The committee reported that Telluride was peaceful, but that the union picketers were armed, and if the mines reopened, local authorities would not be able to prevent violence. Governor Peabody asked President Theodore Roosevelt to send in US Army soldiers; the president refused. The governor sent in 500 Colorado National Guard troops, who arrived in Telluride on 24 November 1903. On 21 November, deputy sheriffs confronted the armed picketers at the Tom Boy mine, and demanded that they surrender their weapons. The picketers refused, and the deputies arrested five of them. Six more picketers were arrested on 24 November, and when the president of the WFM local visited the men in jail, he was arrested as well; all were charged with conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor. Deputy sheriffs began arresting striking miners and charging them with vagrancy. Anyone without a job, meaning all those on strike, were being found guilty of vagrancy, so that WFM strikers had to leave the district to avoid repeated arrests and fines. On 23 December, 11 WFM members were arrested and charged with intimidating strikebreakers. The charges were dropped 5 days later, and the 11 were released, but they were released from the jail in Montrose, Colorado, 71 miles away from Telluride. =Telluride inspires a famous poster= Famous Western Federation of Miners poster entitled \\"Is Colorado in America?\\" During the Telluride strike, a union man named Henry Maki had been chained to a telegraph pole. Bill Haywood used a photo of Maki to illustrate a poster displaying an American flag, with the caption, \\"Is Colorado in America?\\" The poster was widely distributed, and gained considerable attention for the WFM strike. Peter Carlson describes the \\"desecrated flag\\" poster as famous, and \\"perhaps the most controversial broadside in American history.\\"p.71 The WFM obtained an injunction against further deportations in Telluride, and WFM President Charles Moyer decided to go there to test the injunction. Moyer was arrested on a charge of desecrating the flag for having signed the poster, and the National Guard refused to release him when the civilian courts ordered them to do so. For the journey, Moyer had accepted an offer from a Cripple Creek striker by the name of Harry Orchard to travel along as a bodyguard. Orchard later became one of America's most famous, and controversial, assassins.p.71 National guard troops left Telluride on 1 January 1904. By then, the mines and mills were operating with imported, nonunion labor. After the militia left, dozens of expelled strikers returned to the area. The Citizens' Alliance responded by issuing National Guard rifles to attendees at their meeting. The meeting was adjourned and the armed vigilantes immediately rounded up seventy-eight of the union men and sympathizers, expelling them again.p.70 A Telluride merchant, Harry Floaten, had been deported for his union sympathies. He, along with others, tried for three days to meet with Governor Peabody about their treatment at the hands of an anti-union mob, but Peabody refused to see them.p.139 Floaten penned a bitter parody that, according to Peter Carlson, \\"channeled the miners' frustrations.‚Äù: ::Colorado, it is of thee, ::Dark land of tyranny, ::Of thee I sing; ::Land wherein labor's bled, ::Land from which law has fled, ::Bow down thy mournful head, ::Capital is king.p.77 Strikes not called Once the Western Federation of Miners shut down the Cripple Creek mining district, the national leadership tried to bring as many locals out on strike as possible, to shut down metal mining in the state. But the locals were autonomous, and some refused to strike. The Silverton WFM local was asked by the national leadership to strike the mines there in support of the Durango mill strike, which started on 29 August 1903. Most of the ore processed by the Durango mills came from Silverton. But the Silverton local had a contract with the mines that would not expire until 1905, and the Silverton miners were unwilling to abrogate their agreement.\\"Denver,\\" Engineering & Mining Journal, 26 Sept. 1903, v.76 n.13 p.479. On 19 August 1903, the local WFM union at Ouray voted 150 to 50 not to strike.\\"Special correspondence,\\" Engineering & Mining Journal, 3 Oct. 1903, v.76 n.14 p.518. Other WFM locals which declined to strike were union smelter workers at Leadville and Pueblo.\\"Denver,\\" Engineering & Mining Journal, 18 July 1903, v.76 n.3 p.99. =Colorado National Guard ensures its status= In the analysis of historian Melvyn Dubofsky, the Colorado National Guard served private capital more than the public interest.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, University of Illinois Press, 2000, page 28 Yet the National Guard leadership wasn't beyond reminding their wealthy benefactors to live up to their arrangement, even if it required a little mayhem, or even gunfire. An item in The Public, a Chicago magazine, printed a sworn affidavit from a member of the Colorado militia, Major Francis J. Ellison: > When General Bell first sent me to Victor I offered him certain evidence in > regard to the perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed > to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the > men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about > the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County > military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and > General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding > the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced > between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each > fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out > under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally > to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their > faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights > continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle > of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and > asked me if I had a man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called > in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the > presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of > the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the > payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force > them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold > up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in > the morning. I told General Reardon that I was under the impression that > most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so > that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same > end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty > shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing > to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I > took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that > same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator > and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our > revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into > Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon > and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take > Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay [sic] > mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan > could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his > reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money > the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in > giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft > house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were > the only ones who knew anything about the plan.Louis Freeland Post, The > Public, November 5, 1904, page 487 The magazine stated that Ellison's affidavit was corroborated by the affidavits of Chase and Walters. The Durango Democrat reported that Major Ellison's testimony was \\"unquestionably true, being corroborated by the affidavits of other guardsmen, and victims of the whitecappers.\\"Durango Democrat, \\"Startling Exposure, Member of State Militia Makes Affidavit As To Cause Of Disturbances in Cripple Creek\\", October 29, 1904 =Union violence, anti-union violence, and unnatural disasters= Stratton's Independence Mine and Mill. Image from the George H. Stone Collection of Colorado geological features and views, Special Collections, Tutt Library, Colorado College. Using dynamite to effect social changes seems to have been a tradition in the Cripple Creek District even when there was no strike. Private assay offices catered to the individual prospector, and to miners who stole gold out of the mines. Mine owners were concerned about ore theft, and several large mines hired Pinkerton agents beginning in 1897,p.75 but high grading -- the theft of rich gold ore by miners -- was difficult to control. Jameson observes that \\"the Mine Owners' Association paid (someone) to blow up assay offices in 1902 to try to stop high grading.\\"The Colorado Labor Wars 1903-1904, Elizabeth Jameson, 2006, page 26. =Explosion in the Vindicator mine= The Vindicator mine, Cripple Creek district, Colorado, site of a deadly explosion in 1903. On 21 November 1903, two management employees at the Vindicator mine were killed by an explosion at the 600 foot level. The coroner's jury could not determine what had caused the explosion.p.211-212 Although the mine was heavily guarded by soldiers and no unauthorized personnel were permitted to approach, the CCMOA blamed the explosion on the WFM. Fifteen strike leaders were arrested but were never prosecuted. WFM member Harry Orchard later confessed to setting the dynamite bomb on the 600-foot level next to the mine shaft, and rigging it to explode when the next person got off on that level. He wrote that he and another WFM member, Billy Aiken, had entered the mine through an old unused shaft, and that a third, Billy Gaffney, had stayed at the surface as a lookout. Orchard wrote that he had been paid to plant the dynamite by Mr. Davis, the president of the Altman local, one of the WFM locals in the Cripple Creek district. When they heard nothing about an explosion during the next few days, they assumed that their bomb had failed to explode. But they had mistakenly set the bomb on an inactive level, and it did not go off until some time later, when the superintendent and the shift boss got off to inspect the 600-foot level, and set off the dynamite.Harry Orchard, \\"The confession and autobiography of Harry Orchard,\\" McClure's Magazine, Aug. 1907, v.29 n.4 p.375-379. The union blamed the employers for the Vindicator mine explosion, claiming it was just another devious plot that went wrong. They issued a pamphlet which attributed the motive for the explosion to the fact that \\"it was currently reported that the State militia was about to be ordered home, and the mine owners' association was against this removal.\\"The Confession and Autobiography of Harry Orchard, McClure's magazine, Volume 29, S.S. McClure, Limited, 1907, footnote, page 379 The Vindicator explosion occurred not quite three months prior to the \\"shooting\\" plot of the Colorado National Guard described by Major Ellison, who later testified to a motive quite similar to that speculated on by the union (that is, getting the Colorado National Guard forces paid to stay in the field). The Vindicator incident and the apparent efforts to wreck a train raised tensions and provoked rumors throughout the Cripple Creek District. It was said that a shadowy vigilante organization called the Committee of 40, which was composed of \\"known 'killers' and the 'best' citizens,\\" was formed to uphold law and order. The miners were said to have formed a \\"Committee of Safety\\" in response, for they feared that the Committee of 40 planned acts of violence that could be blamed on the WFM, thus creating a pretext for the union's destruction.p.102-103 The National Guard stepped up its harassment, and began arresting children who chided the soldiers.p.103 On December 4, 1903, the governor proclaimed that Teller County was in a \\"state of insurrection and rebellion\\"p.103 and he declared martial law.p.212 Sherman Bell immediately announced that \\"the military will have sole charge of everything...\\" The governor seemed embarrassed at Bell's public interpretation of the decree and tried to soften the public perception.p.212 Bell was undeterred; within weeks, the National Guard suspended the Bill of Rights. Union leaders were arrested and either thrown in the bullpen, or banished.p.105-106 Prisoners who won habeas corpus cases were released in court and then immediately re-arrested. The Victor Daily Record was placed under military censorship, and all WFM-friendly information was prohibited. Freedom of assembly was not allowed. The right to bear arms was suspended-- citizens were required to give up their firearms and their ammunition. An attorney who dared the Guard to come and get his guns found himself confronting soldiers and was shot in the arm.p.213 On January 7, 1904, the Guard criminalized \\"loitering or strolling about, frequenting public places where liquor is sold, begging or leading an idle, immoral, or profligate course of life, or not having any visible means of support.\\"p.214 =Hoist accident in the Independence mine= On January 26, 1904, a cage full of non- union miners broke from the hoist at the Independence mine, and fifteen men fell to their deaths. The coroner's jury found that management was negligent, having failed to install safety equipment properly. The WFM echoed the accusation about negligence, while management claimed the WFM had tampered with the lift, in spite of the union having no access to the militarized property. Reportedly 168 men quit the mine. On March 12, troops occupied the WFM's Union Hall in Victor. Merchants were arrested for displaying union posters.p.215 Then the CCMOA began pressuring employers inside and outside the district to fire union miners, issuing and requiring a \\"non-union card\\" to work in the area, while the WFM took counter-measures to limit the impact. Of the original 3,500 strikers, 300 had returned to work. There was evidence that the non-union mine operators were paying a heavy price for their actions, and the union believed that it was winning the strike.p.216-218 =Explosion at the Independence Depot= Independence train depot after the platform was blown up by dynamite on 6 June 1904 On June 6, 1904, an explosion destroyed the platform at the Independence train depot, killing thirteen and injuring six non-union men going to the night shift at the Findley mine. Sheriff Robertson rushed to the scene, roped off the area, and began an investigation. Immediately after the explosion, the CCMOA and the Citizens' Alliance met at Victor's Military Club in the Armory and plotted the removal of all civil authorities that they did not control. Their first target was Sheriff Robertson. When he declined to resign immediately, they fired several shots, produced a rope, and gave him the choice of resignation or immediate lynching.The Western History and Genealogy section of the Denver Public Library has an online photograph, copyright ¬© 1995-2007 by the Denver Public Library, Colorado Historical Society, and the Denver Art Museum, provided with the caption, \\"Colorado National Guard soldiers lynch labor sympathizer ‚Äì Colorado National Guard soldiers prepare to lynch a man during a labor strike in Cripple Creek, Colorado.

The victim may be Sheriff Henry Robertson. He stands on a chair with his hands behind his back. Chairs are scattered throughout the room. Date [1904].\\" , retrieved June 6, 2008. He resigned. The mine owners replaced him with a man who was a member of the CCMOA and of the Citizens' Alliance. In the next few days the CCMOA and the Citizens' Alliance forced more than thirty local officials to resign, and replaced them with enemies of the WFM. Then ignoring the objections of the county commissioners, the employers called a town meeting directly across the street from the WFM Union Hall in Victor. The city marshal of Victor deputized about a hundred deputies to stop the meeting, but Victor Mayor French, an ally of the mine owners, fired the marshal. An angry crowd of several thousand gathered, and anti-union speeches were made by members of the CCMOA. C.C. Hamlin, secretary of the Mine Owners' Association, urged the people to take the law into their own hands. A miner carrying a rifle challenged Hamlin, and a single shot was fired as someone tried to disarm the miner. Then a number of people began shooting into the crowd. Five men were seriously wounded, two of them fatally. All those wounded were nonunion men.p.123 Fifty union miners left the scene to cross the street to the union hall.p.123 Company L of the National Guard, a detachment from Victor that was commanded by a mine manager, surrounded the WFM building, and took up positions on a nearby rooftop. US Labor Commissioner Carroll Wright sifted through conflicting accounts, and concluded that a man on the roof of the miners hall shot down at the militia, and a militiaman fired back. Then several shots came from windows in the union hall, and the troops returned fire with volleys into the union hall. After an hour of gunfire on both sides, three miners were wounded, and the men inside surrendered so that the wounded could be taken to a hospital. Soldiers searched the building and confiscated 35 rifles, 39 revolvers, and 7 shotguns.p.250-251 The Citizens' Alliance and their allies then wrecked the hall, wrecked all other WFM halls in the district, and looted four WFM cooperative stores. The Victor Daily Record workforce was again arrested. The day of the explosion, all mine owners, managers, and superintendents were deputized. Groups of soldiers, sheriff's deputies, and citizens roamed the district, looking for union members. Approximately 175 people -- union men, sympathizers, city officials -- were locked into outdoor bullpens in Victor, Independence, and Goldfield. Food requirements were ignored until the Women's Auxiliary was eventually allowed to feed the men.p.218-219 On June 7, the day after the explosion, the Citizens' Alliance set up kangaroo courts and deported 38 union members. General Sherman Bell arrived with instructions to legalize the process of deportation. He tried 1,569 union prisoners. More than 230 were judged guilty -- meaning they refused to renounce the unionp.112 -- and were loaded onto special trains and released across the state line. For all practical purposes, in a matter of days the Western Federation of Miners had been destroyed in the Cripple Creek district.p.76 Deportations and expulsions of union members Deportations and expulsions from mining camps had long been practiced by both sides of labor disputes in the western U.S., including various locals of the Western Federation of Miners and its members, anti-union vigilante groups, and military authorities. When non-union workers were deported, it was usually unclear if such deportations were directed or sanctioned by union officials, or were done by union members acting on their own. Deportations by union members were most commonly done to individuals or small groups of strikebreakers, or new arrivals regarded as potential strikebreakers, and driven away by threats or beatings. This had been the case in 1896 in Leadville, Colorado, when the WFM local bought rifles and issued them to teams called \\"regulators\\" who patrolled incoming trains and coaches, and forcing whomever they regarded as a potential strikebreaker to leave town.p.3 Forced expulsions also occurred from 1901 to 1903 in Cripple Creek.p.149-150 In some cases, mine officials disliked by union members were driven out of the area under death threats. In January 1894, the manager of the Isabella mine at Cripple Creek, Mr. Locke, was captured by a large body of armed men, and made to swear that he would leave and never return without permission of the miners, and that he would not identify those who forced him to leave. Once he gave assurances, he was allowed to get on a horse and leave the district.p.22 In July 1894, a group of about 20 to 40 armed men came to the Gem mine in the Coeur D‚ÄôAlene district in Idaho, searching for men who had been ordered by union miners to leave the country. They found one, John Kneebone, and shot and killed him. They then forced the mine superintendent and some other mine officials to walk to the Montana state line, and made them promise never to return.Report of the Industrial Commission on the Relations and Conditions of Capital and Labor Employed by the Mining Industry, 1901, p.CII-CIII. While deportations by unions and union members were mostly deportations of individuals or small groups, state militias acting under martial law, as in the Coeur D'Alene district of Idaho, and at Cripple Creek, sometimes deported hundreds of union members and union sympathizers. Perhaps the largest expulsion by the WFM was in Telluride, Colorado in July 1901, when the WFM under the leadership of union local president Vincent St. John, rounded up 88 nonunion miners - a number of others fled the area ahead of the forced expulsion - marched them to the county line and warned them never to return. Despite a guarantee of safe passage by St. John, a number of the nonunion men were severely beaten, and some shot. When the Citizen's Protective League of Idaho Springs, Colorado forced 14 WFM officers and members out of town following the dynamite attack on the Sun and Moon mine, a speaker noted in justification that the WFM had recently been doing the same thing in Cripple Creek. =Cripple Creek deportations= Under martial law in 1903 and 1904, the Colorado National Guard in the Cripple Creek district would carry out deportations of union men on a large scale, and it would be done by an arm of the state government, rather than by a private group. Governor Peabody worked with the Italian secret service and the Italian consul in Denver to expel \\"undesirable aliens\\" from mining districts.Mark Wyman, Hard Rock Epic, Western Miners and the Industrial Revolution, 1860-1910, 1979, page 50. On June 8, General Bell led 130 armed soldiers and deputies went to the small mining camp of Dunnville, 14 miles south of Victor, to arrest union miners. When they arrived, 65 miners were stationed behind rocks and trees on the hills above the soldiers. One of the miners shot at the troops, who returned fire. There were 7 minutes of steady gunfire, followed by an hour of occasional gunfire. Miner John Carley was killed in the gunfight. The much better-armed soldiers prevailed, and arrested 14 of the miners. The Dunnville miners had been armed with two rifles, three shotguns, and five revolvers. Eight armed men destroyed the office and machinery of the pro-union Victor Daily Record. The WFM was blamed, even though the printers recognized Citizens' Alliance members in the wrecking party. Governor Peabody offered to cover the losses with state funds, and the paper resumed operations as an anti-union paper. The National Guard stopped all work at the remaining union mines. This was carried out on the Great Portland mine, the Pride of Cripple Creek, the Winchester mine, and the Morgan leases at Anaconda. Miners were arrested at shift change and deported. The owner of the Portland mine filed lawsuits to challenge the mine closing, but he was stopped by stockholders who preferred a non-union mine.p.220 General Bell then ordered that all aid to families left behind by the deported miners had to be channeled through the National Guard. By such means he hoped to starve them out, insuring that the miners would have no reason to return to the district. Members of the Women's Auxiliary who distributed food in secret were arrested, taken to the bullpen and intimidated, although they were not held. Over the coming weeks other incidents of intimidation, gunfire, beatings, and expulsion erased every visible trace of unionism in the district.p.223-225 C.C. Hamlin, the secretary of the Mine Owners' Association, would later be elected District Attorney. When court cases were brought against mine owners, mine managers, mill owners, bankers, deputy sheriffs, and other members of the Citizens' Alliance for deporting the union men, and for beatings and destruction, Hamlin refused to prosecute any of the cases.p.136-137,154 Aftermath After decades of struggle, the leadership of the Western Federation of Miners had come to a class analysis of their circumstances. Haywood said that miners were exploited by \\"barbarous gold barons\\" who \\"did not find the gold, they did not mine the gold, they did not mill the gold, but by some weird alchemy all the gold belonged to them.\\" The language of the Cripple Creek District Citizens' Alliance suggests that they also viewed the struggle as a class conflict. Their resolutions to Governor Peabody spoke not of prosecuting the lawless strikers, but rather of \\"controlling the lawless classes.\\"p.147 This view echoed that expressed by the governor when he declared martial law, declaring that such actions were taken to counter \\"a certain class of individuals who are acting together...\\"The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908, MaryJoy Martin, 2004, pages 11-24 and 221. Emphasis added. Benjamin Rastall concluded: \\"The strike may be summarized thus: The unions sowed class consciousness, and it sprang up and destroyed them.\\"p.163 The governor publicly allied himself with the employers' alliances, and he thanked Craig of the Denver Citizens' Alliance for the honor of receiving \\"membership card No. 1.\\"p.147 The governor meanwhile spoke of his supporters -- in particular, donors to a \\"Law and Order Banquet\\" -- as the \\"best element of the State.\\" The railroads offered half- priced fare for those attending the banquet, and \\"business and industrial leaders flocked into Denver from all over the state\\" to honor Governor Peabody for \\"his stand on law and order.\\"p.54-55, 214-215 =Harry Orchard and the Independence Depot explosion= After the explosion at the Independence Depot, the civil authorities were deposed or deported, and those who replaced them assumed WFM guilt. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that Harry Orchard, the WFM member who for one day acted as a bodyguard to WFM President Charles Moyer, and who would later assassinate former Idaho governor Frank Steunenberg, was involved in the crime. WFM member Harry Orchard later confessed that he placed the dynamite beneath the platform, and together with Steve Adams, another WFM member, triggered the blast with a 200-foot long wire as the train approached and men crowded on the platform to meet it. Orchard said that he had been paid to blow up the depot by the WFM leadership.Harry Orchard, \\"The confession and autobiography of Harry Orchard,\\" McClure's Magazine, Sept. 1907, v.29 n.5 p.522. Orchard signed a confession to a series of bombings and shootings which had killed at least seventeen men, including the explosions at the Independence Depot and the Vindicator mine.p.228 In a trial three years later, Harry Orchard would confess to having served as a paid informant for the Mine Owners Association.p.119 He reportedly told a companion, G.L. Brokaw, that he had been a Pinkerton employee for some time.p.228 Newspaper reporters were very impressed with his calm demeanor on the witness stand,p.116 even under cross-examination. But historians still disagree about Harry Orchard's bloody legacy. Orchard confessed to a number of murders, including the explosion at the Independence depot, and said that the WFM had paid him for the crimes. But there was circumstantial evidence and testimony implicating agents of the mine owners for the Independence explosion. Witnesses to the depot explosion saw what may have been explosive powder being carried by CCMOA detective Al Bemore from the Vindicator mine to the depot. One source reported a meeting between Bemore and Orchard the day before the explosion.p.229 Orchard testified that during the Cripple Creek strike, when he thought that the union was not rewarding him enough, he had contacted railroad detective D. C. Scott and warned that some men would try to derail a train. The detectives paid him $20, and arranged safe passage for him through the National Guard lines where union men were not permitted. Orchard's contacts were Scott and K.C. Sterling, a CCMOA detective. Sterling had previously admitted the goal of blaming such violence on the Western Federation of Miners.p.119,125 Orchard recalled that \\"[Scott] told me if I ever got into trouble with the militia to let him know.\\"p.119 Detective Scott, in fact, had taken direct orders from General Sherman Bell,p.229 and Major Ellison testified that Sherman Bell had been implicated in an earlier plot to \\"hold up or shoot\\" working miners just four months prior to the Independence Depot explosion. Bloodhounds were brought in to track the perpetrators of the Independence depot explosion. As US Labor commissioner Carroll Wright noted, \\"Accounts differ as to the trails pursued by these hounds.\\"p.253 One account was that a bloodhound followed a scent trail from the triggering device toward the Vindicator mine, and also to Detective Bemore's house. K.C. Sterling was told via telephone of bloodhounds tracking to the Vindicator mine, and he allegedly said to call off the dogs, they were on a false scent, and he knew who the dynamiter was.p.229 A.C. Cole was a former Victor high school teacher and Republican who served as secretary of the Victor Citizens' Alliance, and a second lieutenant of Company L. He testified that preparations by the Victor militia had already been underway for the anticipated \\"riot\\" in the days preceding the explosion, and that they anticipated the specific date of a significant unspecified event. He had earlier been asked to participate in creating some sort of provocation, and refused. As a result of that refusal he was dismissed from his position with the Citizens' Alliance five days before the Independence Depot explosion occurred.p.230 Cole stated that most of the militia and prominent members of the Citizens' Alliance stayed at the Baltimore Hotel in Victor the night before the explosion. A militia captain exhibited excitement and anticipation when he checked arms and supplies that night before the explosion. Cole testified that \\"It was generally understood and freely discussed that a riot was to be precipitated.\\"P.230 Other members of the Victor militia corroborated Cole's story. Also, a sergeant in the Cripple Creek militia testified that he saw a murder committed by two Mine Owners' Association gunmen to keep someone quiet about the Independence depot explosion.p.231 There was additional testimony that the mine owners had plotted the Independence depot explosion, but had not intended to take lives.p.231 A couple of individuals stated, in effect, that a change of the work shift had put the non-union workers onto the depot platform at the wrong time.p.229-232 Violence The number of deaths as a result of the Colorado labor war were 2 strikers and at least 17 strikebreakers and non-union men. Another 15 strikebreakers died in a hoist accident in the Independence mine, which mine owners blamed on union sabotage, and the union blamed on poor maintenance and inadequate safety practices. The following deaths occurred during the strikes: * 28 July 1903 - Idaho Springs: striking union miner killed by an explosion while trying to blow up the Sun and Moon mine. * 21 November 1903 - Cripple Creek: 2 management employees killed by an explosion at the Vindicator mine. * 26 January 1904 - 15 strikebreakers killed in a hoist accident at the Independence mine; the cause is disputed. * 6 June 1904 - 13 strikebreakers killed by a bomb at the Independence train depot, with at least one other miner mortally wounded.\\"Deadly Havoc by Infernal Machine,\\" Daily Oklahoman, June 7, 1904, pg. 1. * 6 June 1904 - Victor: 2 non-union men killed by gunfire at a mass meeting. * 8 June 1904 - Dunnville: one striking miner killed in a gunfight with troops. =Independence depot explosion= It is widely accepted by popular writers and documentarians that the WFM was guilty of bombing the Independence Depot either because Harry Orchard was a union member, or because the WFM had the obvious motive of attacking strike breakers. However, some writers and historians have raised doubts. Elizabeth Jameson summarized her research into the question of violence, > Whether or not individual members of the Western Federation of Miners > committed violent acts during the strike, violence was not union policy. It > was, however, the policy of the (Cripple Creek) Mine Owners' Association, > the Citizens' Alliance, and the militia.p.233 In 1906 Rastall concluded in part, before Harry Orchard confessed to the bombing, > Concerning the crimes committed during the latter part of the strike so > little evidence has been adduced, that judgment must, for the present, be > suspended. Especially is this true since, at the time the outrages were > committed, the district was completely in the hands of those who sought in > every possible way to fasten the guilt upon the unions.p.150-152 Rastall noted that both sides had men capable of violent crimes, > Many of the men employed as guards by the mine owners during the strike were > roughs of the worst type, men with criminal records either before or since > that time... there were in the employ of the Mine Owners' Association during > the strike men capable of almost any crime, and that, as pointed out by the > unions, these men might as logically be blamed for the overt acts of the > strike as any men who could possibly have belonged to the unions. > During the strike of 1894, a reign of terror was brought about by men of > criminal character, many of whom were admitted to the unions. > There were certain officers [of the WFM] who were willing to countenance and > even to instigate the beating of men and the destruction of property. Would > they not wink at the commission of graver crimes? Rastall notes that, > In the train wrecking case the union attorneys succeeded in throwing a great > deal of suspicion on Detectives Scott and Sterling. Charles Beckman, who had > joined the Federation as a detective for the mine owners, admitted that he > had been urging the commission of various overt acts, but explained that he > did so simply that by working into the confidence of the right men he should > be in a position to know of such plots.p.153 In spite of the portrayal of the WFM as a criminal organization, writer George Suggs concluded in his book about the Colorado Labor Wars, > \\"...at no time did the WFM engage in armed resistance against the > constituted authorities, even when their extreme harassment and provocation > might have justified it.\\"p.189 However, Suggs observed that in the Cripple Creek strike, \\"violence against union members and sympathizers was common.\\"p.114 No clear and indisputable evidence has come to light exclusively implicating either the Western Federation of Miners, or the Mine Owners' Association and their allies, in the worst atrocities. Historians continue to debate who blew up the Independence Depot, and who paid them to do so.The Colorado Labor Wars 1903-1904, Elizabeth Jameson, 2006, page 10. =Harry Orchard's confession= Coinciding with J. Bernard Hogg's analysis of agents provocateurs in \\"Pinkertonism and the Labor Question,\\"\\"Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question,\\" J. Bernard Hogg, Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171--199, page 175, citing Journal of United Labor, July 12, 1888. William B. Easterly, president of WFM District Union No. 1, testified that the only person who discussed violence at Altman WFM meetings during the strike turned out to be a detective.p.229 J. Bernard Hogg also wrote of \\"toughs and ragtails and desperate men, mostly recruited by Pinkerton and his officers from the worst elements of the community.\\"\\"Public Reaction to Pinkertonism and the Labor Question,\\" J. Bernard Hogg, Pennsylvania History 11 (July 1944), 171, 199, page 178, citing The Critic, July 9, 1892. Harry Orchard confessed that he was a bigamist, and that he had burned businesses for the insurance money in Cripple Creek and Canada. Orchard had burglarized a railroad depot, rifled a cash register, stole sheep, and had made plans to kidnap children over a debt. He also sold fraudulent insurance policies.p.118-119 Earlier in the strike, Detective Scott had paid Orchard $20, provided him with a railroad pass, and sent him to Denver where he would meet Bill Haywood for the first time, and offer his services as a bodyguard for Charles Moyer. During that trip to Telluride, WFM President Moyer was arrested by the San Miguel County Sheriff.p.71,119 After former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg was murdered and evidence pointed at Orchard, Pinkerton Detective James McParland obtained Orchard's confession by threatening him with immediate hanging, and said that he could avoid that fate only if he testified against leaders of the WFM. As, apparently, in McKinney's case and the Steve Adams case, Orchard was offered the possibility of freedom and a vague promise of financial reward for implicating union officials in court, with witness coaching as part of the package.p.89-92,98 Orchard's original confession has never been released.p.91 Presiding judge Fremont Wood wrote that the full confession had been available to the defense attorneys, who evidently found nothing in it of value to their clients, for they did not introduce it into evidence.Fremont Wood, The Introductory Chapter to the History of the Trials of Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone, and Harry Orchard (Caldwell, Ida.: Caxton, 1931) 35-36. In 1907 a comprehensive Orchard confession was published in a popular magazine, in which Orchard described using a pistol as a triggering device for explosives.\\"The confessions and autobiography of Harry Orchard\\", Albert Horsley A.K.A. Harry Orchard, publisher New York McClure, 1907. Shattered pistols were found at the Vindicator explosion site and the Independence Depot explosion site.p.211,218 There were also some contradictions in Orchard's allegations.p.119-120 Orchard named at least five WFM men as his accomplices in the crimes to which he confessed. Three of those men stood trial in five court cases, four trials in Idaho and one in Colorado. The juries were hung or returned not guilty verdicts in trials of three of the men; charges against the fourth, WFM president Moyer, were dismissed, and the fifth individual, a WFM executive board member, fled and could not be found. Fremont Wood, the presiding judge in both the Haywood and Pettibone trials, was highly impressed by the way Orchard held up under prolonged and severe cross-examination in each trial, and believed Orchard's testimony to be true. In Wood's experience, no one could have fabricated such a convoluted story, covering many years, in many locations, and including so many different people, and withstand such thorough cross-examination without materially contradicting himself. Wood later wrote that the prosecution case did not convincingly corroborate Orchard's testimony, but that the witnesses put on by the defense actually did a better job corroborating Orchard than the prosecution had done.Fremont Wood, The Introductory Chapter to the History of the Trials of Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone, and Harry Orchard (Caldwell, Ida.: Caxton, 1931) 35-36. Orchard pleaded guilty to Steunenberg's murder, and in March 1908, Judge Fremont Wood sentenced Orchard to hang.Labors' Greatest Conflicts, Emma F. Langdon, May 1908, page 126. His sentence was commuted, and he lived out the rest of his life in an Idaho prison.p.140 In 1952, at 86 years of age and 45 years after the Haywood trial, Orchard wrote in his autobiography that all of his confession and his trial testimony were true.Harry Orchard, Harry Orchard, the Man God Remade (Nashville, Tenn.: Southern Publishing, 1952) 118. =Western Federation of Miners after the Colorado Labor Wars= In the Colorado Labor War, culminating in the \\"climatic disaster\\" at Cripple Creek, \\"the WFM suffered the total destruction of its most stalwart local and the arrest of its most prominent leaders.\\"p.87 But the Western Federation of Miners didn't die during the Colorado Labor Wars. A number of WFM miners and leaders traveled to Chicago in 1905 to help launch the Industrial Workers of the World. The Cripple Creek strike officially ended in December 1907, although for all practical purposes it had ended three years earlier. Bill Haywood was angry that the Western Federation of Miners had failed to gain the support of AFL unions, particularly railroad workers who were AFL members. Railroads hauled ore from the mines to the mills, in spite of the strikes. Haywood wrote. \\"This fight, which is entering its third year, could have been won in three weeks if it were not for the fact that the trade unions are lending assistance to the mine operators.\\"p.80 In 1909 the Colorado State Legislature paid $60,000 to the Western Federation of Miners as compensation for damages inflicted by state troops on the WFM cooperative stores in the Cripple Creek District, and on the WFM union hall in Victor.p.245 The WFM later changed its name to the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers. The renamed union eventually merged with the United Steelworkers. The Western Federation of Miners union hall in Victor, Colorado still stands, bullet holes and all, but is in need of restoration.

Earlier in his life he had worked as a prostitute and a drag queen, and had struggled at times with drug addiction. He died of complications from AIDS in 1990. He established the Maitri Hospice at HSZC for students and friends dying of AIDS during the spread of the epidemic in the 1980s‚Äîthe first Buddhist hospice of its kind in the United States. Numbers of his students and colleagues have observed that Dorsey was the embodiment of a bodhisattva. Biography Hartford Street Zen Center Issan Dorsey was born as Tommy Dorsey, Jr. in Santa Barbara, California in 1933. He was raised as a Catholic and was the youngest child of ten siblings. As a boy he aspired to become an entertainer and studied dance and piano. While in junior college he became dissatisfied with his life, so he left school and joined the U.S. Navy. In the military he was able to fulfill his childhood dream of being an entertainer, putting on shows at his base and on television shows. During the Korean War Dorsey and a male lover were expelled from the Navy, leaving him to spend several years in and out of employment. He finally settled into a job as a waiter for a bar in North Beach, eventually becoming a performer there as a drag queen. His shows were a success and he traveled in a road show known as The Party of Four. On the road in the 1950s he would sometimes work as a prostitute at shows and afterhours, developing a nasty methamphetamine addiction during this period. On the road during his shows Dorsey was introduced as, \\"Tommy Dee, the boy who looks like the girl next door.\\" In the 1960s he returned to San Francisco, where he continued to shoot speed and engaged in dealing drugs on lower Haight Street. He founded his own commune and also managed a rock band. During this period he had a spiritual experience under the influence of LSD while observing a photograph of Ramana Maharshi. He constructed an altar with Maharshi's photograph, where he would shoot speed and gaze at the picture for several hours. Soon, he gave up using drugs and started sitting zazen at the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC) under the guidance of Shunryu Suzuki. In 1980 (while Dorsey was director of SFZC) he became a member of The Gay Buddhist Club, which eventually became known as the Hartford Street Zen Center (HSZC). Originally a discussion group for gay Buddhists, the group eventually began sitting zazen in the basement of one member's house at 57 Hartford Street. In 1987History of HSZC Dorsey had created a hospice (Maitri Hospice) within the Zen center on Hartford Street, serving primarily gay men who were dying of AIDS. Eventually Dorsey was made a S≈çt≈ç priest by his teacher‚ÄîZentatsu Richard Baker‚Äîinstalled as abbot of HSZC in 1989 and given the Dharma name Issan (meaning \\"One-Mountain\\"). Shortly before death, in particularly poor health, Issan was recognized as a roshi. On September 6, 1990, Issan Dorsey died of complications linked to AIDS.

The examiner can impeach the witness when an inconsistent statement is found, and may conversely bolster the credibility of an impeached witness with a prior consistent statement. Impeachment with a prior inconsistent statement Before the witness can be impeached the examiner must have extrinsic evidence of the prior statement. The examiner must also provide the witness with the opportunity to adopt or reject the previous statement. Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 613 In the majority of U.S. jurisdictions, prior inconsistent statements may not be introduced to prove the truth of the prior statement itself, as this constitutes hearsay, but only to impeach the credibility of the witness. However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801 and the minority of U.S. jurisdictions that have adopted this rule, a prior inconsistent statement may be introduced as evidence of the truth of the statement itself if the prior statement was given in live testimony and under oath as part of a formal hearing, proceeding, trial, or deposition.In some U.S. jurisdictions, a prior inconsistent statement that is signed or adopted by a witness is admissible both for impeachment and substantive purposes. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Brady, 507 A.2d 66 (Pa. 1986). This approach has been rejected in the federal system. * Note that under California Evidence Code (\\"CEC\\") ¬ß¬ß769, 770, and 1235, prior inconsistent statements may be used for both impeachment and as substantive evidence, even if they were not originally made under oath at a formal proceeding, as long as \\"the witness was so examined while testifying as to give him an opportunity to explain or to deny the statement.\\"California Evidence Code ¬ß770 Bolstering with a prior consistent statement =Prior consistent statements= A prior consistent statement is not a hearsay exception; the FRE specifically define it as non- hearsay. A prior consistent statement is admissible: # to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated a statement, for instance, during her testimony at trial; # the witness testifies at the present trial; and # the witness is subject to cross-examination about the prior statement.Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 801 (d)(1) There is no requirement that the prior consistent statement have been made under oath at a prior trial or hearing. A form of prior consistent statement excepted from this rule is that of prior identification by the witness of another person in a lineup.

He is also known as the man behind the on-air persona of radio host Scottie McClue. Career Lamont was educated at Greenock Academy The University of Glasgow, The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) and Jordanhill College of Education, where he trained as a secondary school teacher. He started his career working as a trainee manager for the Clydesdale Bank before joining Scottish Opera in 1980 working in a number of roles including Touring Manager, Marketing Officer and Director of Education Programmes. In 1981 he became Assistant General Manager at Pitlochry Festival Theatre. In 1984 he became a continuity announcer and newscaster for Grampian Television (1984‚Äì85), before moving to Scottish Television (1985‚Äì88) and Border Television (1985‚Äì1989) In September 1989 he set up the radio station CentreSound 96.7 in Stirling - now Central 103.1 FM - as its founding managing director In 1992 Colin Lamont moved to Red Rose Gold in Preston,North West Radio to become a senior producer and presenter for the station creating the on-air persona Scottie McClue who became a controversial but highly popular figure, attracting substantial listening audiences and subsequently presenting on a variety of UK stations across Scotland (including Scot FM and Q96, The North East of England, The North West of England, Yorkshire and The Midlands including national station Talk Radio UK in London and in syndication throughout the UK over the next twenty years. In August 2008, he became a shareholder of the Scottish independent local radio station L107 saving it from imminent closure as the former owner was on the brink of returning the licence to OFCOM. The manager was former Q96 manager Alan Shields. Lamont invested more than ¬£62,000 of his own money into the business and ran L107's programming broadcasting on the station mid-mornings 10.00‚Äì12.00 under his Scottie McClue persona. Even with Lamont's substantial investment the station experienced management and stewardship issues and Lamont left the station accusing Shields of failing to contribute his share of funding. The station closed shortly afterwards. In recent years Lamont has taught and lectured widely in communications, performance, acting, media and theatre, presenting his 'Scottie McClue Hogmanay Bash' at New Year on local radio stations. He also appeared on national radio during the Scottish independence referendum and is often sought out as a commentator and contributor for important public events. He has become a pioneer for PAR (Public Access Radio) broadcasting Worldwide on the internet and for The Commonwealth. Scottie McClue Scottie McClue is the on-air persona of Colin Lamont.North West Radio When Lancashire independent radio station Red Rose Radio was split into two frequencies, programme director John Myers wanted distinctive programming for the medium wave service, Red Rose Gold.Red Rose Gold was transmitted on AM, while Rock FM was broadcast on the FM frequency. Myers encouraged Colin Lamont to present the station's late-night phone-in. They believed, however, that the name 'Colin' did not connote showbusiness. Inspired by Scottie Buccleugh, the host of a weekly kids' film club in Carlisle known as 'Uncle Scottie', Myers suggested that Lamont's on-air identity should be 'something mad like this' that would be memorable. The pair eventually came up with Scottie McClue. In 1994 Scottie McClue moved to Scot FM in Edinburgh, to present a new late night phone in. The show received sufficient calls to cause BT to limit the number of calls on the number.Chat's yer Lot, BT tell DJ Scottie He incurred the wrath of radio watchdogs on three occasions about his views about gay men and women and use of language. In January 1997 Scottie left the station after talks about a new contract broke down and moved to Hallam FM in Sheffield and by April 1998,his show was syndicated across TFM in Middlesbrough and all Magic stations then owned by EMAP in Liverpool, Yorkshire and North East England. Scottie also presented on Border Television-owned stations including 100-102 Century FM in Newcastle, becoming the late night phone-in presenter on its Salford Quays-based sister regional station 105.4 Century FM when it launched in September 1998,\\"Degsy Rides Again\\", Trouble at the Top, BBC Two, March 1999 with his show being networked to cover The Midlands on Century 106 in Nottingham in 1999. In 2001 Scottie returned to Scotland on Q96 with his shows being simulcast and networked across the UK. He then returned to EMAP's Magic stations in Sheffield, Liverpool, Leeds and Hull also broadcasting for SRH on Clyde 2 Glasgow on Saturday evenings and Forth 2 Edinburgh on Sunday mornings and also a stint co-hosting with Lesley Riddoch sitting in for Fred MacAulay on BBC Radio Scotland. Scottie McClue had, as analyst Mary Talbot observes, achieved \\"a degree of infamy as a highly confrontational talk radio host\\". Scottie joined Q96 in 2005 before moving to its UTV sister station Talk 107, the 24-hour talk radio station based in Edinburgh, in 2006. He presented his last show for Talk 107 in March 2008 and was replaced with a simulcast of The James Whale Show from London on sister station Talk Sport, which after a few weeks was in turn replaced by another show. In July 2008 Scottie McClue participated in a special edition of BBC Radio's Fighting Talk at the Radio Academy's Radio Festival in Glasgow.\\"The Radio Festival 2008 headed to Glasgow\\" , Radio Academy In his introduction, presenter Colin Murray described McClue as \\"A Scottish broadcasting legend, he claims to have the world record for calls into his phone-in show, I think it was 460,000 in one week, he's been fired or has resigned on the odd occasion from virtually every station in Scotland and the North of England, and how he hasn't developed a show yet for BBC Radio Scotland called \\"I'm Sorry I Haven't A McClue\\" I have no idea.\\" Scottie McClue also presented on many mainstream Scottish radio stations including Forth & Clyde and from 2008 L107 where he also served in a shareholder and management role at the station.

The sports ground is located on the edge of Eastbourne town centre, next to the town hall and is in easy reach of local transport links. The ground was first used in 1884. Sussex County Cricket Club played some of their matches there between 1896 and 2000, and recently from 2017. The complex has: * A football pitch. * Two cricket pitches, one of which is names Larkins field. * An Astroturf Hockey pitch. * A Croquet lawn. * Sports bar and changing facilities. Football The Saffrons is home to Eastbourne Town F.C., who play in the Southern Combination Football League and who have played football here since 1886, when the then Devonshire Park Football Club moved grounds from their former namesake (now the venue for the Eastbourne International tennis tournament). Devonshire Park Football Club changed their name to Eastbourne in 1889 and the 'Town' suffix was added in 1971. The Larkins Field End, where the clubhouse stands, was originally a wooden grandstand structure, built in the 1930s when attendances at the town club were increasing. The Town Hall side, now known as the East Terrace was asphalted at the same time. Sadly the wooden grandstand destroyed by an arson attack in 1969. The stand was rebuilt but lost its roof in the 1987 hurricane. The current stand today, known as the Taffy Jones/Sid Mayall stand was built in 1994, 25 years after the original grandstand was destroyed. In 1946, the pitch was moved closer to the cricket ground to lay foundations for the East Terrace, which still remains today. The Meads Road side of the terrace had the covered stand built in 1962. There are wooden benches in this stand. Floodlights were installed in 1994 and during the 1990s a clubhouse, new dressing rooms and a tea bar have been built behind the stand. The West Terrace, where the team dugouts are situated once had a movable fence depending on when either the football or the cricket was playing. In recent years the cricket green was moved slightly away to allow a permanent fence and asphalt laid for spectators to stand. The main turnsite was originally built in 1914 and was destroyed by a fire in February 2004 but restored before the new season started. The ground plays host to many county cup finals at youth and intermediate level. The capacity of the football ground is 3,000, with seating for 200 spectators. =Stands= * Sid Myall/Taffy Evans Stand previously known as the Larkins Field End, has seating for 200 spectators, also the tea bar, hot food hut and toilets.

In 2012, the Ravens went 10-6, making the playoffs for the fifth straight year and won the AFC North for the second straight year for the first time in franchise history. After defeating Andrew Luck's Colts, Peyton Manning's Broncos, and Tom Brady's Patriots, the Ravens would go on to defeat the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII 34-31, winning their second Super Bowl in franchise history. During the regular season, they would defeat two playoff teams, the AFC East Champion New England Patriots, and the Cincinnati Bengals. After winning the Super Bowl, the Ravens went 8-8 in 2013 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007. Under his coaching Terrell Suggs made the Pro Bowl. In 2014, the Ravens went 10-6, and made the AFC Wild Card. After defeating the Steelers in the Wild Card round they would go on to lose to the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round 31-35. During the regular season they would defeat two playoff teams; the AFC North champion Pittsburgh Steelers & NFC South champion Carolina Panthers. Under his coaching Elvis Dumervil finished third in sacks with Terrell Suggs following in ninth. Dumervil was a 1st-team All-Pro and a Pro Bowler. In Monachino's last year with the Ravens, the team went 5-11 in 2015, the worst record since 2007. Under his coaching Elvis Dumervil made the Pro Bowl. After 2015, he left the Ravens to reunite with his former defensive coordinator, the new head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, Chuck Pagano. = Indianapolis Colts = On January 7, 2016, Monachino was named the defensive coordinator of the Indianapolis Colts. During the 2016 season, the Colts went 8-8 and missed the playoffs for the second year in a row. During the 2017 off-season, the Colts drafted defensive backs Malik Hooker, Quincy Wilson, and Nate Hairston, linebackers Tarell Basham & Anthony Walker Jr. and defensive lineman Grover Stewart in the 2017 NFL Draft. The Colts let Erik Walden, Robert Mathis, and Mike Adams go, but signed defensive lineman Al Woods & Johnathan Hankins, linebackers John Simon, Jon Bostic & Jabaal Sheard. In the 2017 season, the Colts went 4-12 and the Colts missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year and head coach Chuck Pagano was fired. = Chicago Bears = After spending 2018 as a defensive analyst for Missouri, he joined Kansas State in to serve as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach under first-year coach Chris Klieman. A month later, however, he departed the position to become the Chicago Bears' senior defensive assistant and outside linebackers coach, reuniting him with Bears defensive coordinator Chuck Pagano whom he worked with in Baltimore and Indianapolis. The Bears went 8-8 in 2019 and missed the playoffs. Under his coaching, Khalil Mack made the Pro Bowl.

Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their software and hardware configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of color calibration automatic and transparent, as an evolution of ICC profiles. Windows Color System features a Color Infrastructure and Translation Engine (CITE) at its core. It is backed up by a color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 bits per pixel, multiple color channels (more than three), alternative color spaces and high dynamic range coloring, using a technology named Kyuanos developed by Canon. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own gamut mapping algorithm into the pipeline to customize the color response of the device. The new pipeline also supports floating point calculations to minimize round-off errors, which are inherent in integer processing. Once the color pipeline finishes processing the colors, the CITE engine applies a color translation according to a color profile, specific to a device to ensure the output color matches to what is expected. WCS features explicit support for LCD as well as CRT monitors, projectors, printers, and other imaging devices and provides customized support for each. WCS uses color profiles according to CIECAM02, defined using XML, to define how the color representation actually translates to a visible color. ICC V4 color profiles are also supported.

It is one of the oldest roads in the city of Markham and forms the backbone of the 200-year-old community of Thornhill. The street originally ran east from Yonge Street across a tributary of the Don River, at which point it branched north to what is now Leslie Street and south on German Mills Road. This was a travelled road which did not match the alignment of any concession road or lot line and was constructed along the most convenient route to farms and mills to serve the needs of the inhabitants at that time. In the late 20th century an extension was made across Highway 404 and through an industrial area to connect to Woodbine Avenue, east of which it joins with Esna Park Drive. John Street has had a major impact in shaping the community; the parallel Green Lane/14th Avenue east-west road allowance has never been fully opened and Leslie Street still diverts from the route laid out by the township survey to join Don Mills Road near the former easterly end of John Street. Route Description John Street is a four-lane arterial road between Woodbine Avenue and Bayview Avenue, and, due to the presence of Old Thornhill, a two-lane collector road between Bayview and Yonge Street. John Street currently serves to relieve traffic on Steeles Avenue, and Highway 7. John Street also serves as a western extension of 14th Avenue via Alden Road and Esna Park Drive. The combined route is designated York Regional Road 71, which also includes part of Centre Street in the City of Vaughan. Between Bayview Avenue and Yonge Street, John Street is two lanes wide. During that section of the road, there are several stop signs. This part of John street goes up and down through valleys and ridges. As it approaches Pomona Mills Park, the landscape becomes more level. During this section of the road, the roadway is narrow. When the road approaches Yonge Street, light residential areas are found. Between Bayview Avenue and Leslie Street, John Street has 7 intersections with traffic lights. The road is fairly straight, and heads in a southeasterly direction. West of Leslie Street, the street heads into a steep valley, and rise up again shortly to meet Leslie Street. Between Leslie Street and Highway 404, the road passes by the R.J Clatworthy arena and Bishops Cross Park. Between Highway 404 and Woodbine Avenue, all zonings are industrial. John Street forms a link in what is otherwise the first concession road north of Steeles Avenue, with 14th Avenue, Centre Street, and the portion of Highway 7 west of Dufferin Street. However, due to the aforementioned presence of Old Thornhill and the desire to eliminate a jog in Highway 7 by the Province of Ontario, the road alignment was never developed into a single, continuous cross-region arterial. History A historic map of John Street in the Township of Markham This road, along with many side streets in Thornhill, is one of the oldest roads in Markham, with over 200 years of history. The road is believed to be built in the 19th century, named after John Colborne along with Colborne Street, immediately south of John Street. John Street was believed to be built around 1828-1836. Prior to that, Thornhill was a little community with houses along Yonge Street. John Street allowed eastward developments. The development of Thornhill in the 19th century stopped at what is now Henderson Avenue, and along the section of John Street between Yonge Street and Henderson Avenue are developments from that time. The area is now preserved under the city of Markham's Heritage Department. Along John Street in this area, the road signs are labelled as \\"Old Thornhill Circa 1794\\". This part of John Street is also considered as the heart of Old Thornhill. The road is also home to the Sutton Frizzel's house. Originally located on Yonge and Royal Orchard, it was moved in the 20th century due to the widening of Yonge Street. It was built by the Tory Loyalist in the 19th century, and its original occupants played a significant role in the Rebellions of 1837. In the 20th century, as Markham's population rapidly grew, John Street was extended to its current length, with modern housing along the road. In 2004, the corner of John and Bayview was redeveloped into medium dense residential. This redevelopment has been referred to as \\"Olde Thornhill Village\\".

The genus contains a single species, Euchambersia mirabilis, named by paleontologist Robert Broom in 1931 from a skull missing the lower jaws; a second skull, belonging to an immature individual, was later described. It is a member of the family Akidnognathidae, which historically has also been referred by as the synonymous Euchambersiidae (named after Euchambersia). Euchambersia was a small and short-snouted therocephalian, possessing large canines as is typical of the group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation in the side of the skull. Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible. Discovery and naming Video showing deformation correction of the holotype skull The type specimen of Euchambersia was found by Robert Broom on the South African farm of Vanwyksfontein, owned by a Mr. Greathead, near the town of Norvalspont. It consists of a single, distorted skull, catalogued as NHMUK R5696, which was described by Broom in 1931. A second, smaller skull, with the specimen number BP/1/4009, was found in 1966 and described by James Kitching in 1977. Both specimens are missing the lower jaw. They originated from the same general layer of rock, in the upper Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone of the Beaufort Group within the Karoo Supergroup. The Cistecephalus AZ has been dated to the Wuchiapingian stage of the Late Permian, between 256.2 and 255.2 Mya. Broom named the genus Euchambersia, which he considered \\"the most remarkable therocephalian ever discovered\\", after the eminent Scottish publisher and evolutionary thinker Robert Chambers, whose Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation was considered by Broom to be \\"a very remarkable work\\" though \\"sneered at by many\\". Description Life restoration showing hypothetical body Euchambersia was small and short-snouted for a therocephalian, with the type skull having a reconstructed length of approximately , accounting for crushing and deformation in the fossil. The second known skull belonged to a smaller individual, with a length of ; it was probably immature, judging by the lack of fusion in the skull. According to the initial description, the eye socket of Euchambersia was rather small. The branches of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back and bottom of the eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further to the side of the jaw, by any sort of opening. =Teeth= Preserved and reconstructed tooth rows of the second (A-C) and type (D-F) specimens Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT scanning suggests that each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger from the first to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge appears to have a ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root. The type specimen preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, resulting in a specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It is round in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge on the side of its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider near the top of the tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously. =Maxillary fossa and associated canals= 3D reconstruction of the maxillary canals from CT scans, compared with those of other therapsids Behind the incisors and canines, there were no additional teeth in the jaw. Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or fossa, on the side of the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This fossa is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this fossa is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts the bottom of the fossa and then passes into the interior of the mouth. The bottom portion of the fossa is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces. CT scanning shows that these openings lead to canals that connect to the trigeminal nerve, which controls facial sensitivity. The forward-directed canal also splits into the three main branches of the infraorbital nerve, all of which connect to the socket of the canine; the junction occurs about along the canal, another point of variation between the two skulls. The top branch, the external nasal ramus, splits into four branches in the type skull, but it does not split in the second skull. In other therapsids like Thrinaxodon, Bauria, and Olivierosuchus, the external nasal ramus generally splits into three or more branches. All of these canals would have brought nerves and nutrient-rich tissue to the root of the canines and the rest of the upper jaw. Classification In 1934, Euchambersia was assigned to the newly named family Euchambersiidae by Lieuwe Dirk Boonstra.Boonstra L.D. 1934. \\"A contribution to the morphology of the mammal- like reptiles of the suborder Therocephalia\\". Annals of the South African Museum, 31: 215‚Äì267 Boonstra initially misspelt the name as Euchambersidae (which is improper Latin), and was subsequently corrected by Friedrich von Huene in 1940. Euchambersiidae was initially considered to be separate from the families Moschorhinidae and Annatherapsididae; in 1974, Christiane Mendez recognized these groups as closely related subfamilies (renamed Annatherapsidinae, Moschorhininae and Euchambersiinae) within the wider group of her redefined Moschorhinidae (although she also referred to it as Annatherapsididae). The 1986 phylogenetic analysis of James Hopson and Herb Barghusen supported Mendez's hypothesis of three subfamilies within Moschorhinidae, but they elected to use the name Euchambersiidae. In 2009, Adam Huttenlocker and colleagues argued that the names Annatherapsididae, Moschorhinidae, and Euchambersiidae are junior synonyms of Akidnognathidae, since Akidnognathus (which also belongs in the same family) was named first before any other member of the family. This name has reached wider acceptance among researchers. Huttenlocker et al. also later redefined Moschorhininae as all of Akidnognathidae save for Annatherapsidus and Akidnognathus. CT sections through the right canine of NHMUK 5696 CT scan of an incisor possibly from the lower jaw In 2008, Ivakhnenko included the Akidnognathidae (as the Euchambersiidae) as the sister group of the family Whaitsiidae in the superfamily Whaitsioidea. However, other researchers do not include the Akidnognathidae in the Whaitsioidea. Phylogenies by Huttenlocker et al. found that the Akidnognathidae was instead closest to the Chthonosauridae, with the two forming the sister group to the group containing the Whaitsioidea and the Baurioidea. The topology recovered by the 2016 analysis of Huttenlocker et al. is shown below. Paleobiology Restoration of the head =Venom= The large maxillary fossae of Euchambersia have been continual subjects of debate regarding their function. However, most researchers agree that they held some sort of secretory gland. While Broom initially argued that the fossae may have contained the parotid salivary glands, this proposal was rejected by Boonstra and J.P. Lehman, who noted that the parotid glands tend to be placed behind the eye; they respectively suggested that the fossae held modified lacrimal glands and Harderian glands. However, the latter is also unlikely because Harderian glands are usually placed inside the eye socket. Franz Nopcsa suggested that the maxillary fossae housed venom glands (which may have been derived from lacrimal glands), with the ridged canines and the notches behind the canines allowing the venom to flow passively into the victim's bloodstream. This hypothesis was widely accepted throughout the 20th century and the characteristic morphology of Euchambersia was used to support possible venom-bearing adaptations among various other prehistoric animals, including the therocephalian Ichibengops. Cross-section of the canine of Euchambersia as originally illustrated by Broom (top left), with the subsequent \\"grooved\\" reconstruction (top centre) and new reconstruction based on CT scans (top right), compared to those of other mammals (bottom) Much of this acceptance has been based on the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged; grooved canines in Euchambersia would parallel the fangs of various venomous snakes as well as the venom-delivering incisors of the living solenodons. This interpretation, which has consistently appeared in literature published after 1986, was determined by Julien Benoit to be the result of the propagation of Broom's overly reconstructed diagram of the skull, without the context of the actual specimens. He thus considered it necessary to re- evaluate the hypothesis of a venomous bite in Euchambersia. Additionally, Benoit argued that grooved and ridged canines are not necessarily associated with venomous animals either, as shown by their presence in hippopotami, muntjacs, and baboons, in which they play a role in grooming or sharpening the teeth; in the latter two, ridged canines are also accompanied by a distinct fossa in front of the eye, which is entirely unconnected with venom. Furthermore, grooved and ridged teeth in non-venomous snakes are used to reduce suctional drag when capturing slippery prey like fish or invertebrates. Hypothetical reconstruction of the venom gland that filled the maxillary fossa (blue), with maxillary canals shown (green), in the second (A-B) and type (C-D) specimens CT scanning of the known specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, the fact that the canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang B√ºcherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts. An alternate hypothesis suggested by Benoit et al. involves some kind of sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed on the back side of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible. Paleoecology Restoration of Euchambersia with dicynodont prey The Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone, from where Euchambersia is known, represents a floodplain that was covered in many small, relatively straight streams. The water level in these streams was probably seasonally dependent. Judging from pollen preserved in the Cistecephalus AZ, the pollen taxon Pityosporites (which probably originated from a plant similar to Glossopteris) was very common, forming some 80% to 90% of the pollen discovered (although the prevalent sediments would not have been ideal for pollen preservation). In the Cistecephalus AZ, other co-occurring therocephalians included Hofmeyria, Homodontosaurus, Ictidostoma, Ictidosuchoides, Ictidosuchops, Macroscelesaurus, Polycynodon, and Proalopecopsis. More numerous, however, were the gorgonopsians, which included Aelurognathus, Aelurosaurus, Aloposaurus, Arctognathus, Arctops, Cerdorhinus, Clelandina, Cyonosaurus, Dinogorgon, Gorgonops, Lycaenops, Leontocephalus, Pardocephalus, Prorubidgea, Rubidgea, Scylacops, Scymnognathus, and Sycosaurus. By far the most abundant herbivore was the dicynodont Diictodon, with over 1900 known specimens from the Cistecephalus AZ. Other dicynodonts included Aulacephalodon, Cistecephalus, Dicynodon, Dicynodontoides, Digalodon, Dinanomodon, Emydops, Endothiodon, Kingoria, Kitchinganomodon, Oudenodon, Palemydops, Pelanomodon, Pristerodon, and Rhachiocephalus. The biarmosuchians Lemurosaurus, Lycaenodon, Paraburnetia, and Rubidgina were also present, along with the cynodonts Cynosaurus and Procynosuchus. Non-synapsids included the archosauromorph Younginia; the parareptilians Anthodon, Milleretta, Nanoparia, Owenetta, and Pareiasaurus; and the temnospondyl Rhinesuchus.

It is a heritage site of national significance and the entire former Abbey complex is part of the Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites. History Bellelay Abbey complex Arms of Bellelay Aerial view (1953) According to the legend, the monastery was founded in 1136 by Siginand, prior of the abbey of Moutier-Grandval, who got lost in the deep forest of the High Jura while hunting a wild boar and was unable to find his way out. He vowed to found a monastery if he managed to return safely to Moutier, which he did four days later. To the monastery he founded in accordance with his vow he gave the name of \\"belle laie\\" (\\"laie\\" is a female wild boar). According to other sources, the monastery was probably founded as a result of the influence of the Bishop of Basel on the south-west border of the diocese of Basel with the territory of the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval. The foundation was confirmed by Pope Innocent II in 1142.Fondation de l'abbatiale de Bellelay There are numerous spelling variations from the early years of the monastery: Balelaia, Belelagia, Belelai, Belilaia, Bellale, Bella Lagia, Bellelagia and Bellilagia. The name comes from the Vulgar Latin bella lagia (\\"beautiful forest\\"). The abbey possessed various estates widely scattered. It was the mother-house of several other foundations, including Grandgourt Priory, Gottstatt Abbey and Himmelspforte Abbey at Grenzach-Wyhlen in Baden- W√ºrttemberg. Bellelay was under the authority of the diocese of Basel, but operated as an independent lordship under the terms of a protection contract agreed with Bern and Solothurn (by 1414 at the latest) and also with Biel in 1516. Although the abbot had the right of the low justice in the abbey's immediate territory, and was awarded the right to the use of the ring, the mitre and the cross at the Council of Constance in 1414, it does not seem that Bellelay was ever an Imperial abbey. The buildings were ransacked during the Swabian War in 1499. During the Protestant Reformation some of the residents converted to the new faith. However, thanks to the treaty with Solothurn the monastery was spared the effects of the Thirty Years' War. The abbey reached its golden age in the 18th century as a renowned place of education for the sons of European nobility. During the 18th century the monastery buildings were rebuilt and a new church building was dedicated in 1714. The monastery university opened in 1772 and by 1779 it had 62 pupils from throughout Europe. A new dormitory wing was added in 1782 to accommodate the growing student population and by 1797 there were about 100 students at Bellelay. Dissolution In 1797 the buildings were occupied by French troops and secularised. The precious furnishings were sold at this time ‚Äì an altar from Bellelay, for example, is now to be found in the parish church of Our Lady of the Assumption in Saignel√©gier. In the 19th century the monastery premises were used as a watch factory, then as a brewery and finally as a glass factory. In 1890 the Canton of Bern acquired the site, from which time the monastery buildings have been used as a psychiatric clinic. Since the end of the 1960s the premises have also been used for concerts and exhibitions by the Fondation de l'Abbatiale de Bellelay.  Architecture  Painting on stucco The present structure of the abbey church of the Assumption was built by Franz Beer on the Vorarlberg Baroque model between 1708 and 1714. The church has two towers on the west front which formerly had onion domes. The interior is decorated with painted stucco by the Wessobrunn School, created in 1713. The other monastery buildings in the Baroque style are also from the 18th century.

Soon, Gordon becomes \\"Councillor of Chester\\", after he beats tough competition from Tony Hutchinson and Matt Musgrove. With the Richardson family comes considerable angst, culminating in Lewis's suicide, yet Gordon proves himself as the rock to his wife and together they have a son called Tom.

After two studio albums, the band split up, with singer Peter Astor going on to a solo career.

The debut single, \\"Almost Prayed\\" (Creation, 1986), seemed to carry on where The Loft had left off; consequently both interest and critical approval were high for the record, and a second single was issued on Creation that same year. After a German mini-album, for the release of their debut album proper, McGee had successfully managed to sign the band to Elevation Records - the WEA subsidiary with which he was associated. Expectations were high when the Lenny Kaye-produced Mayflower appeared in 1987, but the album was greeted with a mixed response by the critics and the band were eventually dropped from the label. All was not lost, however, as they eventually returned to Creation for a further album, Judges, Juries and Horsemen in 1988. By this time, Oisin Little had departed, and interest in the band had waned. A final single, \\"Always the Light\\", was issued before the band decided to split up.

Christopher reached the big leagues with the 1959 Pittsburgh Pirates, spending three years there before moving to the New York Mets (1962‚Äì65) and Boston Red Sox (1966). While in Pittsburgh, Christopher was used as a backup in all three outfield positions for Bob Skinner (LF), Bill Virdon (CF), and Roberto Clemente (RF). Christopher was first called up when Clemente was injured, making his debut in nothing less than Harvey Haddix's near-perfect game, on May 26, 1959. As a member of the 1960 World Series Champion Pirates, Christopher was a utility player, pinch-running in three games and scoring two runs (in games 2 and 5). Christopher became the Mets‚Äô fifth pick in the 1961 MLB Expansion Draft.

Christopher‚Äòs second-inning single was the only hit against Maloney, who had to settle for a 3‚Äì0 shutout.

Although Christopher‚Äôs major league career had come to an end on June 9, 1966 (he never played for Detroit), he stayed active in the minors through 1968. Christopher also played winter baseball in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. In an eight-season MLB career, Christopher was a .260 hitter, with 29 home runs, and 173 RBI, in 638 games, including one five-hit game and eight four-hit games.

History The first hotel to use the Camino Real name was the Camino Real Guadalajara, opened in 1958. The name of the hotel was taken from that given by 16th century Spaniards to the road that led to the capital of New Spain, today known as Mexico. In 1960, Banamex and a group of private investors created Hoteles Camino Real. Their efforts would be bolstered in 1962 with an affiliation agreement with Western International Hotels (renamed Westin in 1980). The relationship between Westin and Camino Real established the first internationally backed luxury hotel chain in Mexico and ended 31 years later, in 1993. In 2000, Camino Real was bought by business group Grupo Empresarial √Ångeles for US$252 million. The deal included six hotels plus operating rights to 16 total hotels.

Background St Clair was the second son of Henry St Clair, 10th Lord Sinclair and his wife Grizel Cockburn, daughter of Sir James Cockburn, 1st Baronet. As a child he received a commission into the 1st Battalion, Royal Regiment of Foot. Military career St Clair became an ensign of 6th Regiment of Foot in 1694, however was set on halfpay in 1713. In the next year, he was admitted to the 3rd Foot Guards and was promoted to captain in 1714. He served as 2nd major of his regiment from 1722 and as 1st major from 1725, having been advanced to the rank of brevet colonel two years before. In 1734, St Clair was appointed to the command of the 22nd Regiment of Foot and three years later he was transferred to the colonelship of the Royal Regiment of Foot (later renamed as 1st (Royal) Regiment of Foot), which he held until his death. He rose to brigadier general in 1739 and already after another two years to major general. St Clair became lieutenant-general in charge of the British forces in Flanders in June 1745 and in the following year, he was sent with six thousand men to attack Quebec. Because of delays, he sailed instead to capture the Breton port of Lorient. He destroyed the French fortifications near Quiberon and then returned to England. In 1761, St Clair was finally advanced to the rank of full general. Political career St Clair entered the British House of Commons in 1722, sitting for Dysart Burghs until 1734. Two years later, he was elected for Sutherland, which constituency he represented until 1747, when he was again returned for Dysart. He held the latter seat until 1754 and became then member of Parliament for Fife until 1762. St Clair travelled as envoy to the courts of Turin and Vienna in 1748 and later acted as governor of Cork. Personal life Rosslyn Castle In 1735, St Clair bought Rosslyn Castle, which was later inherited by the male heirs of his sisters. On the death of his older brother John St Clair in 1750, he succeeded de jure as Lord Sinclair, but never assumed the title, preferring to retain his seat in the Commons.Richard Cannon, Historical Record of the Twenty-Second, or the Cheshire Regiment of Foot (London, 1849) pages 52-53 Around 1745, he married Janet Dalrymple, the youngest daughter of Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Baronet and widow of Sir John Baird, 2nd Baronet. Their marriage was childless. St Clair died in Dysart in 1766 and was survived by his wife for four years. With his death the lordship became dormant until 1782, when it reverted to Charles St Clair, a first cousin of James Sinclair, 7th Lord Sinclair. Legacy St. Clair, Minnesota is named after St. Clair.

He was the 2007 Republican candidate for Mayor of Fort Wayne, IndianaRepublican Party of Allen County-Fort Wayne, Indiana and the 2002 candidate for the 81st District Indiana House of Representatives. In 2008 he pleaded guilty to two felonies and one misdemeanor for violating campaign finance laws. Public service Kelty was selected by Congressman Dan Coats for the Congressional Student Program. He later served as the Regional Political Director for the Dan Coats for Indiana Campaign, went on to become the Joint Staff Regional Director for both Indiana U.S. Senators Richard Lugar and Dan Coats. Kelty was appointed Chairman of the Young Republicans for the 4th District of Indiana, and organizing Young Republican chapters in eight counties in northeastern Indiana. In 1994 he worked for Senator Dick Lugar's successful re-election campaign, and later worked in the grassroots organizing campaign in Iowa during Lugar's unsuccessful presidential bid in 1995. In 2003, hours into the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Kelty, with the assistance of Cathy Hawks and others, organized the massive \\"Rally for America\\" held in Auburn, Indiana, and headlined by conservative TV and Radio personality Glenn Beck. The Fort Wayne Rally for America was attended by over 20,000 people from Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan and was simulcast via website around the world. The next year Kelty again spearheaded and organized an event to support U.S. soldiers in the Middle East. Kelty executed \\"Operation Recreation\\" in Fort Wayne, mobilizing hundreds of volunteers to collect over eleven tons of recreational equipment to send to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Kelty also raised over $10,000 in donations to pay for the packing and shipping. Kelty served on the boards of the Fort Wayne Chapter of the American Red Cross, the Fort Wayne Drug & Alcohol Consortium, the Fort Wayne Ballet Capital Fundraising Committee, and the Allen County Right to Life Board of Advisors. 2002 State Representative campaign Kelty was the Republican nominee for the 81st District Indiana House of Representatives seat held by incumbent Win Moses in 2002. Kelty very nearly pulled off an upset in this election. Winfield Moses won the election by only 63 votes (verified by a recount). 2007 mayoral campaign Kelty upset Allen County Commissioner Nelson Peters in the May 8, 2007, Republican primary election, setting a matchup against Democrat Tom Henry in the general election. Kelty took 50.3% of the vote against 46.7% for Peters, defeating Peters by 658 votes.http://www.co.allen.in.us/images/stories/Election_board2007/Election%20Summary%20Report%205_21_2007%20Final%20Allen%20County.pdf On November 6, 2007, Kelty lost in the general elections to Democratic candidate Tom Henry. Kelty conceded his loss with his family in the early evening at Allen County Republican Party headquarters. The final results showed Tom Henry with 60% of the vote, compared to Kelty's 40%. Legal issues On August 14, 2007, Kelty was indicted on nine charges relating to his campaign. Five of the nine charges were felonies for filing fraudulent campaign reports, two of the felony charges were for perjury, and the two misdemeanor charges were for co-mingling of funds.WANE-TV Coverage You Can Count On: Our Apologies Kelty's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss all charges on October 22, 2007. On February 8, 2008, the motion was denied. Kelty was scheduled to stand trial on October 20, 2008 in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Prosecutor Dan Sigler stated it did not appear Kelty had any plans of pleading out. Judge Scheibenberger said he would accept a plea bargain no later than October 19.http://www.wane.com/Global/story.asp?S=9091782 Kelty's lawyers were granted a one-day continuance on October 20, 2008 in order to look into new evidence obtained over the weekend.

Due to his plea, Kelty avoided jail time in which he was facing up to 20 years in prison. Pursuant to the plea bargain Kelty paid a $250 fine for each count, for a total of $750, and served 80 hours of community service. Kelty also served one year probation. Two of the three counts Kelty pleaded guilty to were related to campaign finance laws. He also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of false informing, admitting to providing false testimony to the grand jury. The other charges, including perjury, were dropped.

CIR ports are commonly found in consumer electronics devices such as television remote controls, PDAs, laptops, and computers. The functionality of CIR is as broad as the consumer electronics that carry it. For instance, a television remote control can convey a \\"channel up\\" command to the television, while a computer might be able to surf the internet solely via CIR. The type, speed, bandwidth, and power of the transmitted information depends on the particular CIR protocol employed. CIR is the most common type of free-space optical communication. Protocol description Since the consumer IR protocols are for the most part not standardized, computers and universal remotes often memorize a bit stream, possibly with compression and possibly without determining the actual bit rate, and play it back. Similarities between remotes are often largely the accidental result of the finite selection of infrared encoder/decoder chips (though now microcontrollers are also used) and IR receiver modules or imitation of the older chips rather than by design. Manufacturers of consumer appliances often reuse the same protocol on many similar devices, though for each manufacturer and device type there are usually multiple protocols in use. The code listings inform about for any universal remote. =CIR and protocol implementation= With the ready availability of inexpensive microcontroller chips, many remotes may be based on such chips today rather than dedicated remote control encoder chips. This makes it easier to keep the same codes when moving the buttons on the remote. Also, the decoder functionality will often be integrated into a more complicated microcontroller that controls the AV device, eliminating the need for the separate chip. In the absence of a viable standard, the microcontrollers can be used to emulate the ambiguous protocols used by the old dedicated encoder/decoder chips and it appears that this is often the case. There are even stripped down 4-bit mask-programmable microcontrollers designed only for remote control use (such as NEC's ŒºPD612xA (discontinued), ŒºPD613x, ŒºPD1724x, ŒºPD6x; and ŒºPD17932x 8-bit family). These offer keyboard wake, low power standby modes, and sample controller code though similar features are present on more general PIC microcontrollers or Atmel AVRs. =CIR influences in other devices= Some infrared wireless laptop keyboards and mice use protocols similar to consumer IR devices. Some PC remote controls used for controlling computer media players, controlling presentation software, or other applications also use consumer IR style protocols. Some computer remotes, keyboards, and mice may also use IrDA protocol though IrDA was designed for very short range use. =Standards= Sony manufactured a number of consumer devices of different types that share a common proprietary protocol, called S-link. A jack on each device allowed the remote control signals to be interconnected between devices. The protocol included the useful but unusual feature of supporting more than one of the same type of device (such as multiple CD changers). Some AV components could generate informational status codes that could be used to do things like automatically stop your tape deck when the CD you were recording stopped playing. Software running on a PC with a suitable interface could also control the AV components and monitor their activity; for example, your computer could tell what disk and track were playing in your CD changer and look up the titles in one of the internet CD databases. Sony charges 5000 USD for access to the S-Link documentation.Sony S-Link Resource Center Sony use the SIRC protocol for remote controls.https://www.sbprojects.net/knowledge/ir/sirc.php Sony SIRC Protocol SIRC is developed in three different versions: 12 bit, 15 bit and 20 bit. After 12 bits have been received, the receiver waits to see if there are more falling edges to know if the SIRC protocol is 15 bit or 20 bit coded. The RECS-80 and RC-5 codes developed by Philips have been casually referred to as international standards.Juergen Putzger. Decoding IR Remote controls Eric Maass (2001). 'How does a universal remote control work?', MadSci However, the RECS-80 protocol was prone to interference and was quickly replaced by the RC-5 protocol. Although it appears that they were proprietary protocols developed by Philips, they were also adopted by various other manufacturers, specifically European- and US-based ones. This allowed interoperability between the remote handsets and equipment of various brands. The RC-5 code was, and still is, used by many US- and European-based manufacturers of specialty audio/video equipment. Unfortunately, documentation of the standard commands were not widely distributed. Therefore, there are some brands of equipment that use non-standard commands, causing interference with other equipment also using the RC-5 protocol. The RC-5 command set was defined in the late 1980s and expanded to increase the number of commands in the early 1990s (sometimes called RC-5x). However, the rapidly expanding requirements for newer categories of electronics products since that time (e.g., DVD players, cable boxes, DVR's, et cetera) has led Philips to replace the RC-5 protocol with the newer RC-6 protocol that has both an expanded set of devices (256 versus 32) and commands per device (256 versus 64 in RC-5 and 128 in RC-5x). Again, information on the RC-6 protocol is not readily available from Philips. In contrast, the major Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers almost universally adopted a protocol that was developed and administered by NEC (now Renesas). In the NEC protocol, each manufacturer is assigned a unique code that is contained in the transmitted command, avoiding the possibility of false triggering by other remote handsets. RECS-80 uses pulse-position modulation and RC-5 uses bi-phase. Early dedicated-purpose chips were offered by Philips Semiconductors to allow for the easy use of RECS-80 and RC-5 protocols. The SAA3004, SAA3007, and SAA3008 encoder chips used RECS-80, and the SAA3006 and SAA3010 encoder chips used RC-5. The SAA3049A decoder chip decoded either type. (Note that the Philips Semiconductors division is now NXP Semiconductors). All of these chips have been discontinued. However, these transmission protocols are easily created and/or decoded with general-purpose 8-bit microcontrollers, such as those offered by Microchip Technology and Atmel. Transmission of the IR commands requires only a microcontroller and an infrared LED, available from a wide variety of sources. Reception of the modulated commands for RC-5, RC-6, and the NEC protocols is easily accomplished with specialized IR receivers, most readily available from Sharp Corporation and Vishay Intertechnology. These receivers include a photo-diode, an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit, and a demodulator. The demodulated signal is then decoded with a microcontroller. CEA-931-B defines a method for encapsulating remote control codes over IP and CEA-931-A defines a method for encapsulating remote control codes over IEEE-1394 . These documents are not free even though free standards are the norm for Internet Protocols and contributed significantly to their widespread adoption. =Protocol limitations= The lack of standardization creates many problems for consumers: the need to purchase universal remotes because the original cannot control related functions on interconnected devices and to upgrade them when buying a new device, universal remotes that do not adequately control the devices, inability to control more than one of the same type unit, the inability in most consumer setups to stop tape recording when CD ends, the inability of VCRs to control cable channels, and owning more than 5 different remotes. =Technical information= * Infrared wavelength: around 870 nm and 930‚Äì950 nm.Lamp Section, National Electrical Manufacturers Association (1998). Interaction of Infrared Controls And Electronic Compact Fluorescent LampsePanorama. Infrared remote control technologyhttp://www.vishay.com/docs/82486/tsmp58138.pdf Latter is preferred because water in atmosphere blocks sunlight in this wavelength making devices less susceptible to blinding. * Carrier frequency: Usually fixed carrier frequency, typically somewhere between 33 and 40 kHz or 50 to 60 kHz. The most commonly used protocol is the NEC protocol, which specifies a carrier frequency of 38 kHz. The NEC protocol is used by the vast majority of Japanese-manufactured consumer electronics. The Philips RC-5 and RC-6 protocols both specify a carrier frequency of 36 kHz. However, the early RC-5 encoding chips divided the master frequency of the 4-bit microcontroller by 12. This required a ceramic resonator of 432 kHz to achieve a 36 kHz carrier, which was not widely available. Many companies therefore used a 455 kHz ceramic resonator, which is commonplace due to that frequency being used in the intermediate frequency stages of AM broadcasting radios, resulting in a carrier frequency of 37.92 kHz (essentially 38 kHz). Even documentation for Philips' own controller chips recommended an easier-to-obtain 429 kHz ceramic resonator, yielding a carrier frequency of 35.75 kHz. Modern IR transmitters typically use 8-bit microcontrollers with a 4 MHz master clock frequency, allowing a nearly arbitrary selection of the carrier frequency. * Modulation schemes: typically 100% amplitude-shift keying (ASK). May also involve pulse- position modulation, biphase/manchester encoding, etc. of the transmitted pulses (as opposed to the carrier itself). Most remotes use the length of the space between pulses to encode data. * Data rate: usually significantly lower than the carrier frequency. Most protocols seem to range between 120 bits/second and 4 bits/second. Data rate may be variable as some common bit encoding schemes vary the timing between pulses to distinguish between a 1 and 0. * Encoding: varies based on encoder/decoder chips used. Usually includes some redundancy for error detection or correction. For example, some NEC chips send the same code four times (inverted the second and fourth time). * Key to code mapping: varies from remote control to remote control. In many cases, the codes sent may have more to do with the row and column positions on the remote than any unified plan.

Although the play featured nine original songs with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Jule Styne, all of the songs were presented as either rehearsal or audition material and not as the thoughts or feelings of the characters. Background The original 1957 Broadway production featured only two pianos, but RCA Victor released a fully orchestrated original cast recording of the score, leading many to conclude that Say, Darling was actually a musical. In a case of art imitating life not once, but twice, the show is an adaptation of Richard Bissell's semi-autobiographical novel of the same name which chronicled his experience adapting his novel 7¬Ω Cents for The Pajama Game, making it in essence a play of a book about a musical adaptation of a book. It focuses on Jack Jordan, who is brought to Broadway to help develop his best-seller into a musical for leading lady Irene Lovelle. His journey provides him - and the audience - with an education about what goes on behind-the scenes on the Great White Way, from auditions to rehearsals to rewrites in hotel rooms to feuds among cast members, all under the watchful eye of veteran stage producer/director Richard Hackett (loosely based on George Abbott) and a very young fledgling co-producer, Ted Snow, whose financial acumen greatly outweighs his show business savvy. Because of their similar physical appearance, actor Robert Morse (who played Snow) was widely thought to be imitating producer Harold Prince, who had co-produced The Pajama Game. Productions The Broadway production, directed by Burrows and choreographed by Matt Mattox, opened on April 3, 1958 at the ANTA Playhouse, transferring to the Martin Beck Theatre for the last five weeks of its 332-performance run. In addition to David Wayne as Jack Jordan, Vivian Blaine as Irene Lovelle, and Robert Morse as Ted Snow, the cast included Johnny Desmond (Rudy Lorraine), Jerome Cowan (Richard Hackett), Horace McMahon (Schatzie Harris), and Constance Ford (Frankie Jordan). Eddie Albert replaced Wayne later in the run. Appearing in small roles as chorus performers were Elliott Gould and Virginia Martin. Morse was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play and won the Theatre World Award for his performance. The play was revived Off-Broadway at the West End Theatre in New York City for 16 performances in May through June 1996 under the direction of Robert Armin.blairstowntheaterfestival.com, biography of Robert ArminWillis, John.\\"'Say Darling' listing, 1996, p. 158\\"Theatre World 1995-1996 Season, Hal Leonard Corporation, 1998, (books.google.com) An original cast recording was released by RCA Victor with orchestrations and musical direction by Sid Ramin.

The first poet to say that they were interested in being in the film was Allen Ginsberg. Almost 40 poets performed more than 75 poems, and filmmaker Emile de Antonio helped cut down the filmed material to 90 minutes long. The film is interspersed with parts of an interview with Charles Bukowski. Performers include Allen Ginsberg, Kenward Elmslie, and Anne Waldman.

Lymnaea stagnalis is widely used for the study of learning, memory and neurobiology. Lymnaea stagnalis has a relatively simple central nervous system (CNS) consisting of a total of ~20,000 neurons, many of them individually identifiable, organized in a ring of interconnected ganglia. Most neurons of the Lymnaea stagnalis central nervous system are large in size (diameter: up to ~100 Œºm), thus allowing electrophysiological dissection of neuronal networks that has yielded profound insights in the working mechanisms of neuronal networks controlling relatively simple behaviors such as feeding, respiration, locomotion, and reproduction. Studies using the central nervous system of Lymnaea stagnalis as a model organism have also identified novel cellular and molecular mechanisms in neuronal regeneration, synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory formation, the neurobiology of development and aging, the modulatory role of neuropeptides, and adaptive responses to hypoxic stress. Habitat This large snail lives only in freshwater: it prefers slowly running water, and standing water bodies. Lymnaea stagnalis in typical mating position of this species. The top snail is performing the male role (sperm donor), its white preputium (penis-carrying organ, Pp) can be seen inserted under the shell of the sperm recipient, where the female opening is located. During insemination, sperm (from the seminal vesicles) and seminal fluids (from the prostate gland) are transferred. Since these are simultaneous hermaphrodites, sexual roles can be swapped immediately afterwards. Life cycle Eggs of Lymnaea stagnalis Lymnaea stagnalis is a simultaneously hermaphroditic species and can mate in the male and female role, but within one copulation only one sexual role is performed at a time. Lymnaea stagnalis perform more inseminations in larger groups and prefer to inseminate novel over familiar partners. Such higher motivation to copulate when a new partner is encountered is known as the Coolidge effect and has been demonstrated in hermaphrodites firstly in 2007.

The predecessor of the current observatory was originally opened in 1774 in the nearby city of Mannheim but degradation of observational conditions there resulted in a relocation to the K√∂nigstuhl in 1898.This article incorporates information from the German Wikipedia. The observatory forms part of the Center of Astronomy of the University of Heidelberg. The Max Planck Institute for Astronomy opened on an adjacent site in 1967. Prof. Dr. Andreas Quirrenbach is the observatory's director since 2005.  History  The instrumentation of the observatory originated from the Mannheim Observatory, founded in 1774. In 1880 the observatory was provisionally moved to Karlsruhe because the astronomical/atmospherical seeing conditions worsened. In subsequent years, three other locations were considered, with Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl finally being chosen. On 20 June 1898 the \\"Gro√üherzogliche Bergsternwarte\\" was ceremonially inaugurated by Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden. The astronomical institute comprised two complementary departments, the astrophysical, led by Max Wolf, and the astrometrical led by Karl Wilhelm Valentiner. Valentiner was director of the Mannheim observatory and initiated the move to Karlsruhe. After Valentiner's retirement in 1909, both departments were placed under the administration of Max Wolf. The Bruce double astrograph named after Catherine Wolfe Bruce While the new observatory complex was still under construction Max Wolf obtained a grant of $10,000 from the American philanthropist Catherine Wolfe Bruce for the acquisition of a powerful new dual refractor telescope, the Bruce double astrograph. For many years this telescope was the observatory's main research instrument. He later obtained a grant to build the observatory's a reflector telescope, the observatory's first. The main field of activity of the observatory was the investigation of nebulae and the search for asteroids. Wolf, his staff and his successors discovered over 800 asteroids, including the first trojan asteroid Achilles in 1906. The observatory ceased to be run by the German federal government in 2005 when it was joined with the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics and Astronomical Calculation Institute to make up the Center of Astronomy of the University of Heidelberg. Between 1912 and 1957 Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth discovered almost 400 asteroids from the Heidelberg-K√∂nigstuhl State Observatory.

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, he learned the game while working a childhood job as a pinsetter,\\"Today in History, July 29\\" at The Library of Congress website. and went on to become one of the legends of ten-pin bowling and a founding member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) in 1958. He was six-time bowler of the year, a 10-time All-American, and became known simply as \\"Mr. Bowling.\\"First Annual National Championship article, pba.com; accessed June 4, 2017. He was voted the Greatest Bowler of All-Time in a 1970 Bowling Magazine poll, and ranked #1 among 20th Century bowlers by Bowlers Journal in 1999. At the vanguard of celebrity endorsement, he capitalized on his fame during televised bowling's most popular period to become the first athlete of any kind to earn $1,000,000 in a single endorsement deal, for Ebonite International. Bowling career Prior to the PBA being formed, Carter was known as a dominant bowler in major tournaments of the 1950s, as well as in team play. In the nine BPAA All-Star tournaments (predecessor to the U.S. Open) between 1952 and 1960, Carter won four times and never finished lower than fourth. He won five World Invitational events in a six-year span (1957 to 1962), finishing second the only year he did not win. He also won one ABC Masters title in 1961. As a team bowler, Carter helped the Pfeiffer Beer team of Detroit, Michigan, win the 1953 ABC Open Championships before he moved back to St. Louis. Carter was then part of the \\"Budweisers\\" Bowling Team that won the National Team Match Games title four times in five years (1956, 1957, 1959, 1960). On March 12, 1958 this team established an ABC league series record for a five-man team (3,858 pins) that stood for more than 35 years. Carter rolled games of 266, 253 and 235 in that session for a 754 series. Ray Bluth, Dick Weber, Tom Hennessey, and Pat Patterson were also on that 1958 team. Unlike most bowlers who keep their arm straight on the backswing as they are about to release the ball, Carter kept his elbow bent, never straightening his arm. Although the PBA was not formed until Carter was 32 years old, he still won seven PBA titles (five of them majors) including the inaugural PBA National Championship in 1960. He won four titles and $49,000 in prize money in 1962 alone. That year, he also made 18 top-five finishes (still a PBA record), including seven straight top-five finishes (a feat matched only by Dick Weber since), and he was named the Bowling Writers Association of America's Bowler of the Year. In 1964, he signed a $1,000,000 multi-year deal to endorse Ebonite bowling products, at the time the highest single deal of its kind. He was the PBA's first president, and served four years overall in that capacity. A bad knee forced him to retire from competitive bowling in 1972. Personal life Carter enlisted in the United States Navy in 1944, and spent two years as a radarman in the South Pacific. He was a baseball player in high school, and played AAU baseball with the likes of Yogi Berra and Joe Garagiola. He signed a minor-league contract with the Philadelphia Athletics in the fall of 1946. After one minor league season, he hung up his baseball spikes and returned to St. Louis to take a job at Golden Eagle Lanes. Working as an alley man, bartender and janitor, he bowled as often as he could during his time off. In 1951 he was invited to bowl for the Pfeiffer Beer team in Detroit, where his bowling career reached high momentum. Carter married professional bowler LaVerne Haverly (n√©e Thompson) in 1953. The two divorced in 1964. His second marriage, to Pat Hardwick in 1966, ended in a 1972 divorce. In 1973 Carter married professional bowler Paula Sperber, who had won the 1971 U.S. Women's Open and had an outstanding pro bowling career. Carter's first and third wives, Haverly and Sperber, are both in the WIBC (now USBC) Hall of Fame. Don remained married to Paula until his death in 2012. The PBA recently held a mixed doubles tournament called the Don and Paula Carter Mixed Doubles Championship. Beginning in 1978, Carter appeared in selected TV commercials for Miller Lite beer, which had begun using athletes and celebrities in its ad campaigns a few years prior.Lite Beer from Miller commercial, bowlingvids.com; retrieved June 12, 2014.

It is made at the Glenrothes distillery located in the town of Rothes in the heart of the Speyside region of Scotland. The distillery sits beside the Burn of Rothes, hidden in a glen on the edge of the town. The Glenrothes is renowned for the quality, structure and flavor, the result of over 140 years of whisky making tradition. Since its opening, the whisky from the distillery has been one of the most sought after on Speyside. In 2018, The Glenrothes 25 Year Old was awarded the Ultimate Spirits Challenge top honour, the Chairman's Trophy for Best Speyside Single Malt. Production Under the ownership of Berry Bros. & Rudd, vintage bottlings of The Glenrothes were produced from 1993Page 139, Malt Whisky Yearbook 2010. onwards. The Vintage 2004 is considered the last known vintage to be bottled by the distillery. In 2018, The Glenrothes replaced its vintage range with a series of age statement single malts that included a 10, 12, 18 and 25 Year Old. The Glenrothes is mainly matured in Sherry-seasoned European and American oak casks, built to specification in Jerez, Spain. Ex-Bourbon cask are also used but to a much lesser extent. The result is a multidimensional single malt range with a spectrum of flavours ranging from the delicate and fresh 10 Year Old to the rich and sophisticated 25 Year Old. Special bottlings include \\"Single Cask\\" bottles, which are taken from one single cask of whisky from a particular year. The Glenrothes is one of the rare Scotch whisky distilleries to have a cooperage on site. Character The house style of the Glenrothes is rich, fully rounded and elegant. The whisky delivers a ripe bouquet of fruits and creamy vanilla, sometimes more spicy, sometimes more floral. History The distillery was built in 1878 by James Stuart & Co, who then also worked the nearby Macallan distillery. The first whisky ran off the stills on the 28 December 1879, the same day as the Tay Bridge disaster. The distillery itself had a shaky start and turbulent history. Over-proof whisky is notoriously highly flammable and the distillery has paid the price. Extension work began in 1896 on a second malt kiln, and an increase in stills from two to four but, before the work was finished, a fire in December 1897 caused serious damage. The distillery saw further damage with a serious explosion in 1903. Then, in 1922, a fire in Warehouse Number One caused the loss of of whisky. Another fire in 1962 afforded the opportunity for expansion and a further re-build in 1982 extended the still hall to five wash stills and five spirit stills.

Biography Born in Brussels into a family that produced many female artists, Marie-Ad√©la√Øde Kindt was trained in drawing by engraver Antoine Cardon. She studied painting under Fran√ßois-Joseph Navez and was encouraged by Jacques-Louis David.Creusen, Alexia, \\"Kindt, Marie-Ad√©la√Øde, dite Ad√®le\\" in E. Gubin, C. Jacques, V. Piette & J.

Her early works included many historical scenes. Her √âpisode des journ√©es de septembre 1830, portraying a scene from the Belgian Revolution of 1830, is considered her masterpiece and is on display in the Brussels city museum on the Grand Place. After the 1840s, Kindt painted much less ambitious works, largely portraiture and genre scenes. Although she adapted her style to suit the changing tastes of the public, she never recaptured the success of her early career. She died in Brussels. Her date of death is usually said to have been in 1884, but this has also been described as a \\"stubborn error\\" that should be corrected to 8 May 1893. Her death was reported in the newspaper Le Patriote on 12 May 1893, in coverage of registrations of births, deaths and marriages in the city of Brussels.

For his actions in combat in Tam Ky, Vietnam, Bacon was awarded America's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. Early life Bacon was born in Caraway, Arkansas, on November 25, 1945, one of nine children. His parents, Johno and Beta Imogene \\"Jean\\" (Meadows) Bacon, were sharecroppers on a cotton farm. His siblings were sisters Jenny, Brenda, Judy, Hope, and Wanda and brothers Doyle, Johno Jr., and Andy. In 1951, a poor farming economy prompted the family to move to Glendale, Arizona, where Johno Bacon's parents lived. Nicky Bacon grew up driving tractors and picking cotton on the ranch where his father worked. He dropped out of Peoria High School to work full-time to support the family when his father contracted polio, although he later earned a GED. \\"I hated picking cotton and that other stuff,\\" he later said. \\"I've done my share of it. And I'll guarantee you one thing: I've never, ever went back to it once I was old enough to hold a man's job.\\" Military service In 1963, at age 17, Bacon forged his mother's signature to enlist in the Arizona National Guard. The next year, he joined the US Army, and after basic training at Fort Ord in California, he was stationed in Worms, Germany. Of his military service Bacon later said, \\"I was never prouder, I was never in better shape, I was never more sure that I stood for something in my life than I was when I wore the uniform.\\" He served his first tour of Vietnam in 1966 during which he was wounded three times. On his first mission in Vietnam, the helicopter he was riding in collided with another, killing everyone except Bacon and one other soldier. Bacon volunteered to serve a second combat tour in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. He reached the rank of staff sergeant while serving with Company B, 4th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 11th Infantry Brigade of the Americal Division. On August 26, 1968, while leading a squad in Bravo Company's 1st Platoon, in an operation west of Tam K·ª≥, Bacon and his unit came under fire from enemy positions. While Bacon destroyed these positions with hand grenades, his platoon leader was wounded in open ground. Assuming command, Bacon led the platoon in destroying still more enemy emplacements. When the 3rd Platoon lost its leader, Bacon took command of that platoon as well and led both platoons against the remaining enemy positions. During the evacuation of the wounded, Bacon climbed the side of a nearby tank to gain a vantage point and direct fire into enemy positions, despite his exposure to enemy fire. \\"I got my boot heel shot off, I got holes in my canteens, I got my rifle grip shot up,\\" he recalled in \\"Beyond Glory,\\" a 2003 book by Larry Smith of history interviews with Medal of Honor recipients. \\"I got shrapnel holes in my camouflage covers, and bullets in my pot. A bullet creased the edge of it, tore the lining off.\\" He was personally credited with killing at least 4 enemy soldiers and destroying an antitank gun. 1SG Nick Bacon shortly before retirement from the US Army For his actions in this battle, Bacon received the Medal of Honor. The medal was formally presented to him by President Richard Nixon during a 1969 White House ceremony. For his service in Vietnam and throughout his career, he also received the Distinguished Service Cross, the Legion of Merit, two Bronze Stars, two Purple Heart medals (one awarded later in 2008 due to an administrative oversight) and numerous other awards and decorations. \\"Did I enjoy combat? Yeah. I enjoyed the game,\\" Bacon said in the \\"Beyond Glory\\" interview. \\"I was good at it.\\" Nick Bacon's name listed on the Arizona's War Heroes Memorial Bacon requested a third tour of duty in Vietnam but was denied. He instead served as a recruiter at Fort Hood, Texas, was stationed in Giessen, Germany, and worked in the training command at Fort McClellan, Alabama, before retiring in June 1984 as a first sergeant. He chose to retire from the military when he received orders to go to Korea. He was newly married to his second wife and had a young son. \\"When I was young, it was fun traveling and having new adventures,\\" he told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in 1997. \\"But I didn't want to start over again with raising a family back home and being halfway around the world myself. As you get older, you would like to think of yourself as tough and that you could still strap it all on and head for the boonies, but you can't do that . . . Wars are fought by young men.\\" Later years and legacy Nick Bacon in 2005 while Director of the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs Bacon had six children, daughters Kristy and Kim and sons William, James, Wyatt, and Britt. Bacon was also a Christian, declaring in a published statement on the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks: \\"I am a Christian, and as spiritual as the next person\\" and stating his belief that the \\"greatest weapon we have in America is our faith in God and his Grace and Power.\\" After his military retirement, Bacon returned with his wife, Tamera Ann, to Arizona and worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs at their Phoenix regional office. While there, he was the co-originator of the Med-Vet Healthcare Program in Phoenix and participated in John McCain's 1986 political campaign in which McCain was first elected to the U.S. Senate. Bacon later served as town manager for the Phoenix suburb of Surprise from 1987 to 1990, during which time he oversaw the expansion of the town's territory and development by annexing nearly 75 square miles of land. Bacon was praised for his efforts by Surprise City Councilman Roy Villanueva, who initially opposed Bacon's expansion efforts but later commented that Bacon \\"was a good person who involved himself with the community and tried to help Surprise as much as possible.\\" Likewise, former Surprise City Clerk Sherry Aguilar commented on Bacon's drive. \\"It seemed like he had so much energy and was really wanting to take (Surprise) to the next level,\\" she said. \\"It seemed like he was so enthusiastic.\\" Dedication plaque at a flag pole in Heber Springs, AR. In 1990, Bacon moved back to Arkansas and lived in the town of Rose Bud. He was appointed director of the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs by Governor Jim Guy Tucker in April 1993 and served until his final retirement in February 2005. During his tenure, he helped establish the Arkansas State Veterans Cemetery and the Arkansas Veterans Coalition. He \\"used the recognition he received throughout his life to draw attention to veterans' issues\\" and \\"considered the cemetery one of his greatest accomplishments\\" according to his brother John. Bacon was part of the official United States delegation to normalize relations with Vietnam in 1995 and traveled to Israel in the late 1990s on behalf of Jewish veterans to urge the Israeli government not to cede the Golan Heights to Syria. He later served as president of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society and Chair Emeritus of the American Board for Certification in Homeland Security. Bacon was also inducted into the Military Police Hall of Fame at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. In 2006, Bacon was honored by the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History with the Arsenal Award in recognition of his service to the nation and the State of Arkansas. Bacon was also inducted into the Arkansas Military Veterans Hall of Fame and the Arizona Veterans Hall of Fame. Bacon's other honors included the George Washington Award from the State of Arizona, the FBI Civilian Academy Award, The American Academy of Medical Administrators' Statesman Award, the Minuteman Award, the 82nd Airborne Iron Mike Award, and the Omar Bradley Award of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Bacon was an active member of numerous veterans' organizations, including the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. In 2004, Bacon was appointed by House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, an independent, 13-member panel charged with studying the military's system of compensating veterans for injuries to ensure that it was equitable and fair. The commission issued its final report, which made more than 100 recommendations, in 2007. He also served on the President‚Äôs National Hire Veterans Committee and the Veterans Disability Benefits Commission. Bacon ventured into private business later in life, serving as president and chief executive of DVC Construction, Inc. Bacon, along with Steven Spielberg, was included in the production credits for the video game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. Bacon died on the morning of July 17, 2010, after a long battle with cancer. He was the last living Medal of Honor recipient from the state of Arkansas. His widow Tamera remembered him above all as a man of faith. \\"In life Nick was faced with a lot of battles,\\" she said, \\"whether fighting in Vietnam, fighting for our veterans, fighting for this small town or fighting cancer. Through all these battles Nick‚Äôs strength was his relationship with our Lord, Jesus Christ.\\" His brother John remembered his humility and friendliness. \\"He was very humble and he accepted the roles,\\" John Bacon said. \\"I was impressed so many times going to banquets with dignitaries and politicians. It didn't affect him in the least. He was as comfortable with a person on the street as he was with George W. Bush.\\" Likewise, his nephew, Surprise police Lieutenant John Bacon, stated that Bacon \\"was very humble and unassuming. He was a leader in a very quiet way but he wasn't afraid to speak out when he needed to.\\" Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe referred to Bacon as an \\"American hero\\" and stated \\"He never wanted anything for himself, but always wanted to protect other people in uniform. Arkansas will miss him.\\" Bacon's burial took place with full military honors at the Arkansas State Veterans Cemetery in North Little Rock on July 24. The Nick Bacon memorial The Veterans of Foreign Wars has since honored him with the establishment of the Nick Bacon Memorial Scholarship for children and grandchildren of disabled veterans and has named VFW Post 285 in Surprise, Arizona in his honor. Likewise, \\"a Memorial Room at an American Legion Post in Little Rock now honors Nick Bacon.\\" In 2012, the United States House of Representatives passed H.R. 3870X, which was introduced by Congressman Timothy Griffin (R-AR) and acted to \\"designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 6083 Highway 36 West in Rose Bud, Arkansas, as the Nicky \\"Nick\\" Daniel Bacon Post Office.'\\" Heber Springs, Arkansas installed a new flagpole and a memorial marker honoring Bacon in the town ball park in 2012. The City of Surprise, Arizona unveiled a memorial to Bacon in the plaza outside the city hall on November 11, 2014 in a ceremony including nearly fifty members of his family, US Congressman Trent Franks, Arizona Secretary of State of Arizona Ken Bennett, and Arizona House of Representatives members Debbie Lesko and Rick Gray.

In the city, the route has an interchange with I-94 / I-694. Afterwards, it intersects with several county roads: CR 152 and CR 130 (Brooklyn Boulevard,) and CR 109. It also has a new interchange with US Highway 169 (US 169). In Osseo, it intersects with Jefferson Highway / Central Avenue. In Maple Grove it intersects with Zachary Lane North, CR 30 (93rd Avenue), CR 130 (Elm Creek Boulevard), MN 610, Fernbrook Lane and Maple Grove Parkway. In Dayton, it intersects with CR 101 / CR 13\\\\. In Rogers it intersects with CR 150 and becomes MN 101 at I-94. From Rogers to Robbinsdale the speed limit stays between ; near downtown Minneapolis it is . History CR 81, between the Robbinsdale and Minneapolis border and present-day US 169 in Brooklyn Park, was constructed between the late 1940s and 1950s. Until I-94 and I-494 were built, CR 81 served as the principal route between Minneapolis and points northwest. Formerly a trunk highway supervised by the state and known as US 52, US 169, MN 101, MN 152, and MN 218 in various segments at various times, the state turned over management of the roadway to Hennepin County in 1988 and it was renumbered to CR 81\\\\. From 1982 to 1988, a portion of the route was known as MN 81\\\\. The portion of CR 81 from Rogers to Robbinsdale was recently signed as Bottineau Boulevard, named after historic frontiersman Pierre Bottineau. The portion of CR 81 in North Minneapolis is still signed as West Broadway. In 2004, the at-grade intersection with MN 100 was converted into an interchange along with other intersections on MN 100 during a reconstruction project. In 2008, a reconstruction project in Robbinsdale (Lowry Avenue to MN 100) was completed. Also, in Maple Grove, a reconstruction project near Fernbrook Lane, Elm Creek Boulevard, and Maple Grove Parkway was completed, reconstructing the Fernbrook Lane intersection and adding new intersections at Elm Creek Boulevard and Maple Grove Parkway, when Elm Creek Boulevard was extended and Maple Grove Parkway was paved to its reconstructed interchange with I-94. In 2011, the intersection with US 169 was converted into an interchange, along with the road's reconstruction from the former intersection with US 169 to CR 109 (85th Avenue), the extension of the nearby 83rd Avenue North and construction on local streets. Also in 2011, when MN 610 was extended, a half of a new interchange was built south of CR 130 (Elm Creek Boulevard) near the end of the new portion of MN 610\\\\. In Rogers, CR 81's terminus was moved from its former intersection with MN 101/CR 150 to MN 101's interchange with I-94. Also the intersection with MN 101 and CR 150 was demolished, during a different road construction project. Future Since 2000, local governments and business leaders in the CR 81 corridor (also known as the Northwest Corridor Partnership) have been working together on a strategic redevelopment plan supported by a transit line. Rapid bus transit was originally considered for this corridor in the early 2000s. Since 2007, light rail transit is now being studied as the more favorable option. =Reconstruction work= A segment of CR 81 reconstruction project began in 2010. This section is from 47th Avenue North in the city of Robbinsdale to CR 30 in the city of Maple Grove, resulting ultimately in a six-lane divided urban roadway. The project also passes through the cities of Crystal, Brooklyn Park, and Osseo. The goals of this project are to improve the safety and operations along the roadway, changes will be made to existing access. Major intersections will also be reconstructed. Construction will occur in segments. Construction of Segment One (47th Avenue North in Robbinsdale to CR 10/Bass Lake Road in Crystal) began in 2010, and is expected to be completed in the summer of 2012. Also the construction of Segment Two (CR 81/Bass Lake Road in Crystal to 63rd Avenue North in Brooklyn Park) is partially funded, and expected to begin in 2012. Segments 3 and 4 (63rd Avenue to US 169, US 169 to CR 30/93rd Avenue) are currently not funded.

The law of California consists of several levels, including constitutional, statutory, and regulatory law, as well as case law. The California Codes form the general statutory law. Sources of law The Constitution of California is the foremost source of state law. Legislation is enacted within the California Statutes, which in turn have been codified into the 29 California Codes. State agencies promulgate regulations with the California Regulatory Notice Register, which are in turn codified in the California Code of Regulations. California's legal system is based on common law, which is interpreted by case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court of California, California Courts of Appeal, and Appellate Divisions of the Superior Courts of California, and published in the California Reports, California Appellate Reports, and California Appellate Reports Supplement, respectively (among others). Counties and incorporated cities may promulgate local ordinances which are usually codified in county or city codes, respectively. There are also several sources of persuasive authority, which are not binding authority but are useful to lawyers and judges insofar as they help to clarify the state of the law. =Primary sources= Constitutional law The foremost source of state law is the Constitution of California, which like other state constitutions derives its power and legitimacy from the sovereignty of the people. The California Constitution in turn is subordinate to the Constitution of the United States, which is the supreme law of the land. Legislation Pursuant to the state constitution, the California State Legislature and the Governor have enacted the California Statutes, which in turn have been codified into the 29 California Codes. The first four codes, enacted in 1872, were the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Penal Code, and the Political Code (which much later would become the Elections Code). However, these did not constitute a complete codification, and statutes on subject matter inappropriate for the four codes were simply not codified. In 1929, the Legislature finally established the California Code Commission as a permanent government agency (it had previously existed only intermittently on an ad hoc temporary basis), and it spent the next thirty years slowly codifying the rest of the California Statutes. Upon completing this task in 1953, the Code Commission was replaced by the California Law Revision Commission. Strangely, although there is a Code of Civil Procedure, there was never a Code of Criminal Procedure; California's law of criminal procedure is codified in Part 2 of the Penal Code. The newest code is the Family Code, which was split off from the Civil Code in 1994.  Regulations  Front page of the California Regulatory Notice Register Pursuant to certain broadly worded statutes, state agencies have promulgated an enormous body of regulations, which are codified in the California Code of Regulations (CCR) and carry the force of law to the extent they do not conflict with any statutes or the state or federal Constitutions. Pursuant to the California Administrative Procedure Act, a \\"Notice of Proposed Action\\" is published in the California Regulatory Notice Register (Notice Register) and at least 45 days are required for public hearings and comment before being reviewed and approved by the California Office of Administrative Law (OAL) and codified in the CCR. The Judicial Council of California has also promulgated the California Rules of Court, which includes such publications as the Standards of Judicial Administration and the Ethics Standards for Neutral Arbitrators in Contractual Arbitrations, under the authority of article VI, section 6, of the Constitution of California. Local ordinances California has several different types of local governments throughout the state. California is divided into 58 counties, including San Francisco (a consolidated city‚Äìcounty with the powers of both types of entities) and municipal areas incorporated as cities.Twenty-two cities in California style themselves \\"town\\" but this distinction has no legal significance. All of the state's territory is within one of the counties, but not all of it is within the boundaries of a city; the areas not under city control are called unincorporated areas and are directly managed by county governments. School districts, which are independent of cities and counties, handle public education. Many other functions, especially in unincorporated areas, are handled by special districts, which include municipal utility districts, transit districts, vector control districts, and geologic hazard abatement districts. Counties and incorporated cities may promulgate ordinances which are usually codified in county codes and city codes, respectively. Every act prohibited or declared unlawful, and every failure to perform an act required, by the ordinances are misdemeanor crimes, unless otherwise specified as infractions.California Government Code ¬ß 25132.California Government Code ¬ß 36900 et seq. Binding legal precedents California's legal system is based on common law. Like all U.S. states except Louisiana, California has a reception statute providing for the \\"reception\\" of English law. California Civil Code Section 22.2 is as follows: \\"The common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to or inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, or the Constitution or laws of this State, is the rule of decision in all the courts of this State.\\" This statute was signed into law on April 13, 1850 after several months of debate over whether California should adopt common law, civil law, or a hybrid of both. Governor Peter Hardeman Burnett touched off the debate by recommending to California's first state legislature that the state should borrow Louisiana's Civil Code and Code of Practice (that state's name for a code of civil procedure) and use the common law for everything else. A minority of lawyers led by John W. Dwinelle wanted to adopt the civil law, but the majority of lawyers and Senate Judiciary Committee chair Elisha Oscar Crosby wanted to adopt the common law, and the latter position was duly adopted by the Judiciary Committee in its report to the Senate in February 1850. All statutes, regulations, and ordinances are subject to judicial review. They can be overturned by any state court of record if they impermissibly amend an initiative statute,People v. Kelly, 47 Cal. 4th 1008 (2010). The Kelly court held: \\"[T]he Legislature is powerless to act on its own to amend an initiative statute. Any change in this authority must come in the form of a constitutional revision or amendment to article II, section 10, subdivision (c). Therefore, we are compelled to conclude that section 11362.77 impermissibly amends the [Compassionate Use Act].\\" are unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution or the California Constitution, or be overturned by a federal court if they are unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution. Pursuant to common law tradition, the courts of California have developed a large body of case law through the decisions of the Supreme Court of California and the California Courts of Appeal. The state supreme court's decisions are published in official reporters known as California Reports. The decisions of the Courts of Appeal are published in the California Appellate Reports. Both official reporters are now in their fourth series. The California Appellate Reports, the official reporter of the Courts of Appeal The content of both reporters is compiled and edited by the California Reporter of Decisions. The Reporter maintains a contract with a private publisher (as allowed by Government Code Section 68903) who in turn is responsible for actually publishing and selling the official reporters. The current official publisher is LexisNexis. In addition to the official reporters, published California cases are also printed in two Thomson West unofficial reporters: the regional Pacific Reporter and the state-specific California Reporter (both now in their third series). All Supreme Court decisions are published, but less than 10% of Court of Appeal decisions are published. \\"Unpublished\\" decisions handed down after 1980 are generally available through the LexisNexis and Westlaw databases, but are useful only for academic researchers or as an aid in finding relevant published decisions. An unpublished decision in a criminal or civil action generally cannot be cited in any other action in any California court.Rule 8.1115(a), California Rules of Court. Because the state supreme court was extremely overloaded with cases during its first half-century (resulting in the creation of the Courts of Appeal in 1904), a few hundred minor opinions that should have been published simply were not. In response, a small group of lawyers later undertook the tedious task of plowing through the state archives to recover and compile such opinions, which were published in a separate reporter called California Unreported Cases starting in 1913. Despite the reporter's name, those decisions are also citable as precedent, since they would have been published but for the court's severely disorganized condition at the time they were issued. The orders and decisions of the Superior Courts of California in their capacity as trial courts are never published. However, the appellate divisions of the superior courts (which hear appeals from infractions, misdemeanors, and \\"limited civil\\" cases) occasionally certify opinions for publication, which appear in a \\"Supplement\\" to the California Appellate Reports. The California Court Case Management System (CCMS) is the court case management and electronic court filing (e-filing) system intended for use by the several courts, though development has been stalled since 2012. Since then, all courts not yet on CCMS have resorted to a variety of alternative solutions. =Secondary sources= Non-binding legal precedents Even when a prior legal decision does not create a binding precedent, the text of the court's opinion may still help lawyers and judges understand California law.People v. Zavala, No. H036028, 2013 WL 5720149, at *56 (Cal. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2013) Some types of prior decisions may be cited as non-binding authority in California courts, while others can only be consulted informally. The most powerful form of non-binding authority in California are the portions of appellate opinions known as dicta, in which a court discusses legal issues that it is not obligated to decide in the case before it. Dicta from the California Supreme Court is entitled to great weight, and the Court of Appeal rarely exercises its power to disregard the high court's gratuitous statements about California law.9 Witkin, Cal. Proc. 5th (2008) Appeal, ¬ß 511, p. 575. Cases from other states are often cited in California appellate opinions, particularly when the out-of-state decisions disagree with one another.Minkler v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 49 Cal. 4th 315, 318-19, 232 P.3d 612, 614 (2010) However, this occurs less in California than in smaller jurisdictions, because the state's tremendous size guarantees that most legal issues have already been decided by some prior California court. Decisions from federal courts are also frequently cited as a source of persuasive authority about California law, even by the California Supreme Court.Wilson v. 21st Century Ins. Co., 42 Cal. 4th 713, 724, 171 P.3d 1082, 1089 (2007) Although California courts have no obligation to follow federal precedents about matters of state law, they generally follow federal decisions on issues of federal law, even though they are only required to do so when an issue has been settled by the United States Supreme Court.Haynes v. EMC Mortgage Corp., 205 Cal. App. 4th 329, 335, 140 Cal. Rptr. 3d 32, 37 (2012) Unpublished decisions from California courts are also an important source of information about state law, even though they cannot be cited in future cases.California Rules of Court, Rule 8.1115 - Citation of Opinions, http://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=eight&linkid;=rule8_1115 Technically, the Court of Appeal is obligated to publish any opinion that materially contributes to the development of California caselaw, but this rule is not strictly followed, and the Court of Appeal often fails to publish opinions until a party submits a request to that effect.Gerald F. Uelmen, Publication and Depublication of California Court of Appeal Opinions: Is the Eraser Mightier Than the Pencil, 26 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 1007 (1993) Legal treatises Restatement (Second) of Torts Legal treatises are one of the most important sources of secondary authority about California law. These texts are expressly recognized as a source of 'unwritten law' by California's Code of Civil Procedure.California Code of Civil Procedure ¬ß 1899 (\\"Unwritten law ... is collected from the reports of the decisions of the Courts, and the treatises of learned men.\\") The two most influential treatises are published by The Witkin Legal Institute Summary of California Law and The Rutter Group.California Civil Procedure, 2012, Walter H. Helser, p. 24. Both are divided into discrete volumes about specific areas of the law, and each of the volumes is authored by a panel of judges and lawyers with special expertise in the particular topic. Collectively, these volumes have been cited thousands of times in judicial opinions.Helser, 2012, at p. 7 Unique features Because California law is enormous, it is necessary to focus only on a few features which are unique to California law, when compared to the laws of its sister states as well as federal law. =Popular sovereignty= California has a powerful tradition of popular sovereignty, which is reflected in the frequent use of initiatives to amend the state constitution, as well as the former state constitutional requirementCal. Const. Art. VI, ¬ß 18 (1849). (repealed in 1966 and enacted as Government Code Section 100) that all government process shall be styled in the name of \\"the People of the State of California\\".California Government Code Section 100. (Government Code Section 100 also expressly states that sovereignty resides in the people.) This means that all criminal prosecutions and all enacted laws are done in the name of \\"the People\\", rather than \\"the State\\" or \\"the Commonwealth\\" as in much of the United States. The preambles of the state's two open meeting laws, the Brown Act and the Bagley-Keene Act, both contain the same sentence: \\"The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.\\" =Statutory structure and citation= California is unusual in that like Texas and New York, and unlike 46 other states, it has separate subject- specific codes rather than a single code divided into numbered titles. During the state's first century, the California Legislature was rather sloppy in drafting statutes. This has resulted in two bizarre anomalies in California statutory law. First, some acts are designated as \\"Acts\\" and others are designated as \\"Laws\\", with no coherent distinction between the two. A typical example of this problem is in California consumer law, where an injured consumer may attempt to sue on behalf of all similarly injured consumers under the Unfair Competition Law and the Consumers Legal Remedies Act. The second oddity is that California is the only state that always precedes a citation to statute subsections with the word \\"subdivision\\" (abbreviated in some contexts to \\"subd.\\"). The reason is that the Legislature often failed to leave gaps in the section numbering in the California codes for future expansion, and then occasionally resorted to the shortsighted technique of appending an alphabetical letter to a section number in order to insert a new section between two existing sections on similar subject matter. For example, the summary judgment statute in California is Section 437c of the Code of Civil Procedure. But alphabetical letters are traditionally used in the U.S. to designate subsections of statutes. To avoid confusion as to whether one is citing section 437c (that is, the section with number 437c) or 437(c) (subsection (c) of the section numbered 437), the \\"subdivision\\" prefix must be used when citing any subsection of all California statutes. Similar to New York, but unlike most other states and the federal judiciary, nearly all of California civil procedure law is located in the Code of Civil Procedure (a statute) rather than in the California Rules of Court (a set of regulations promulgated by the judiciary). Therefore, whenever the Judicial Council of California identifies a significant defect in California civil procedure, it must lobby the Legislature and the Governor to change the statutes, rather than merely promulgating a simple rule change. This can be problematic as even noncontroversial technical amendments may be stalled due to unrelated disputes between the Legislature and Governor. A recent example is the California Electronic Discovery Act, which was vetoed in October 2008 (along with many other bills) by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger simply as his expression of disgust with the Legislature's inability to fix the state's dysfunctional budget, rather than because of any substantive defect in the bill itself.Cheryl Miller, \\"Schwarzenegger's Veto: A Raw Deal for E-Discovery\\", The Recorder, 3 October 2008, page unknown. The Electronic Discovery Act had to be reintroduced in the next legislative session and was finally signed by the Governor on June 29, 2009. =Codification= Unlike the majority of states, contract law is fully codified in the Civil Code (which even includes details such as a definition of consideration). However, the Restatement of Contracts (Second) is also used by California courts. Non-compete clauses are automatically void except for a small number of exceptions. Evidence privileges are fully codified in the Evidence Code (meaning if it's not codified it doesn't exist), in contrast to the Federal Rules of Evidence, which has allowed a residual exception for continuous development of privileges under the common law.Pitchess v. Superior Court, 11 Cal.3d 531, 113 Cal.Rptr. 897, 522 P.2d 305 (1974). =Celebrity justice= The huge concentration of celebrities in Hollywood has resulted in a large number of statutes custom-tailored to the needs of celebrities, such as the California Celebrities Rights Act, as well as the 1990 enactment of the first anti- stalking law anywhere in the United States (which inspired the enactment of similar laws across the country). Celebrities' marital problems (and their ability to pay to litigate them thoroughly) have resulted in a very detailed Family Code, a rich corpus of family case law, and a large number of family law specialists officially certified by the State Bar of California. Lee Marvin,Marvin v. Marvin, 18 Cal.3d 660, 134 Cal.Rptr. 815, 557 P.2d 106 (1976). Barry Bonds,In re Marriage of Bonds, 24 Cal.4th 1, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 252, 5 P.3d 815 (2000). and Frankie ValliIn re Marriage of Valli, 58 Cal.4th 1396, 171 Cal.Rptr.3d 454, 324 P.3d 274 (2014). are among the celebrities whose marital disputes were litigated before the Supreme Court of California. Celebrities' spouses often attempt to establish California jurisdiction over marital disputes, since the state's community property system (under which a 50/50 split of marital assets is strictly mandated by statute) is more favorable to the noncelebrity spouse who earned less during the marriage than the celebrity spouse. The widespread distribution of Hollywood motion pictures and television shows has given millions of media consumers worldwide some degree of superficial familiarity with California law. For example, the section numbers of the California Penal Code have become familiar to viewers around the world. Section 187 (murder) is probably the most well-known. =Powerful, innovative or controversial laws= The Unruh Civil Rights Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act are among the most powerful civil rights laws in the United States. Both offer much broader coverage and more generous remedies than their federal equivalents. California appellate courts were the first in the United States to begin carving out exceptions to at-will employment, in 1959. The California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Sec. 21000, et seq.Cal. Pub. Res. Code ¬ß 21000) (CEQA) has far more lenient standing requirements than the federal National Environmental Policy Act, with the result that it is much easier for California landowners to sue each other than comparable landowners in other states.See, e.g. Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood, 45 Cal. 4th 116, 194 P.3d 344, 84 Cal. Rptr. 3d 614 (2008). California is renowned for its innovations in tort law, including strict liability for defective products, insurance bad faith, market-share liability, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and wrongful life. The California three strikes law (codified in the Penal Code) has resulted in severe penalties in some cases and has been somewhat controversial in its application. Proposition 13, passed by California voters in 1978, created one of the strongest limits on property tax in the country. The law limits a property's total tax rate for all local governments to 1% of \\"taxable value\\". Taxable value is defined as the most recent purchase price of the property, plus increases each year of 2% or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower.

It reached 20 mm in height, was attached to the sea floor by a stalk, and looked loosely like a flower. The cup-shaped body at the top of the stalk probably fed by filtering the surrounding seawater, and may have created a current to facilitate this. Its mouth and anus sat next to one another. In his pioneering excavations of the Burgess Shale, Charles Doolittle Walcott excavated the first, and at the time only, specimen. It had evidently caught his eye, for he had taken the trouble to carefully photograph it‚Äîbut he never found the time to describe the organism, and it was not until 1977 that Simon Conway Morris described the animal. He tracked down two further specimens, collected by further expeditions by teams from Harvard and the Royal Ontario Museum, allowing him to produce a reconstruction. He was not able to say much about the organism. It consisted of a calyx (or body) on a long, thin stalk, surrounded by a whorl of 18 short \\"petals\\", which enclosed both openings of its U-shaped gut. The presence of this gut identified it as a metazoan, and the stem implied that it lived permanently attached to the sea floor by a small holdfast. The twenty or so \\"petals\\" borne by each organism were solid, plate-like structures, about two thirds the length of the calyx. It is speculated that they may have been covered with cilia‚Äîfine hairs‚Äîwhich would have wafted food down towards the organism's mouth. A number of affinities were considered, but on the basis of available evidence it didn't quite seem to fit into any extant phylum. The most similar organisms were the much smaller entoprocts, but even these modern organisms are difficult to classify. Further specimens have since been produced by similarly spectacular fossil sites in China. 13 have been found in the Chengjiang, then in 2006 one specimen was identified within the Kaili Formation. These organisms merited the erection of a new species, D. venustus, as their corrugated \\"petals\\" possessed radial rays. However, these new data have added little to the debate; while a suggestion of echinoderm affinity has been floated, no phyla are compellingly similar to the organism. Other modern ideas, even if a little tenuous, include a suggestion that the organism may have been parasitic, dwelling on the carapaces of larger organisms. Dinomischus is not the only sessile, stalked organism from the Cambrian, but it has no obvious relatives in other genera. Siphusauctum gregarium (known as the \\"tulip animal\\") has been recovered from the Burgess Shale, but has a clearly different basic anatomy, with multiple openings at the base of the calyx, an anus at the top, and a large six-petaled internal organ interpreted as a filter-feeding device. Dinomischus has also been likened to Eldonia and Velumbrella, although unlike Dinomischus these medusoid organisms have tentacles.

(2014). Galba (Galba) truncatula (M√ºller, 1774). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=822446 on 2014-11-17 Until recently, this species was known as Lymnaea truncatula. Galba truncatula is the vector mainly involved in fascioliasis transmission to humans.  Distribution  Apertural view of a shell of Galba truncatula.Galba truncatula is believed to be native to Europe, but it has been introduced in other parts of world. Currently, Galba truncatula is commonly distributed in all European countries, including most Mediterranean islands such as Corsica, Malta, the Azores, Madeira, the Faroe Islands, the Balearic Islands, and the Canary Islands. Despite the fact that Galba truncatula has spread worldwide, exact distribution maps of the species are not available. In addition, most reports are based on morphological determination of the snail. Molecular evidences on the presence of Galba truncatula from non-European areas are limited. Galba truncatula has also been found in North and South America, several parts of Africa, and Asia. In South America, the presence of Galba truncatula has already been molecularly verified in Bolivia, Peru, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. In Africa, Galba truncatula is present mainly in Northern parts (i.e. Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, Egypt) but also in South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. In Asia, the snail occurs in Russia but other Asian countries were reported very rarely. Galba truncatula was found in Iran, Pakistan and India. Description The height of the shell is 5‚Äì10 mm and the width of the shell is 2.5‚Äì6 mm. The maximum length of the shell is 12.00 mm. Whorls are stepped. The columella is folded. Tentacles are wider and with a wide base. Eyes are small. Mantle roof shows larger unpigmented whitish spots giving a pale appearance to the shell of living specimens by transparency. The first bilateral teeth is tricuspid in radula. The praeputium/penis sheath length ratio is 2.50-5.90 mm (mean 3.44 mm). Two species that have a similar morphology: Galba neotropica and Galba schirazensis. Although several phenotypic characteristics may a priori be helpful for a preliminary specimen classification, a definitive classification of a specimen can only be obtained by the sequencing of at least one of the molecular markers used: ITS-2, ITS-1, 16S and cox1. Moreover, mixed populations of Galba truncatula and Galba schirazensis have already been described in the field.  Ecology  3D volume rendering of microCT scan of Galba truncatula shell. = Habitat = Galba truncatula can occupy both temporary and permanent freshwater habitats. The species occurs commonly in shallow well aerated water, in marshes, ponds, lakes, streams, rivers, water ditches.Gl√∂er P. (2002). √úberfamilie Lymnaeoidea Rafinesque 1815. Familie Lymnaeidae Lamarck 1812. In: Gl√∂er P. (ed.) Die S√º√üwassergastropoden Nord-und Mitteleuropas. Bestimmungschl√ºssel, Lebensweise, Verbreitung. Die Tierwelt Deutschlands 73. Conchbooks, Hackenheim, pp. 200‚Äì232. In France, the populations of Galba truncatula are declining because its habitat is threatened by modern agricultural practices. In case of larger water bodies, the snail occurs mostly on the edge between water and land, sometimes outside water layer on mud. Galba truncatula can be very abundant, with high population densities and it has an evident anthropophily including usual presence in human neighbourhood. Galba truncatula is amphibious organism and can survive long dry periods. This is caused by its high ability to aestivate during drought conditions. It is known that Galba truncatula can survive 6 weeks to 4.5 months of dry periods in aestivated stage in mud. In the laboratory cultures, Kendall (1949) observed survival over 1 year in Petri dishes without water. The species requires alkaline pH (pH range 7.0 up to 9.6) Nilsson C., Ericsson U., Medin M., Sundberg I. (1998). S√∂tvattenssn√§ckor i s√∂dra Sverige ‚Äì en j√§mf√∂relse med 1940-talet.

Galba truncatula can live at a very high altitude such as in the Northern Bolivian Altiplano (an area located between 3800 and 4100 m high altitude). = Feeding habits = Galba truncatula feed on algae and fresh or decomposed parts of plants. Beran L. (1998) Vodn√≠ mƒõkk√Ω≈°i ƒåR. Metodika ƒåSOP 17, ƒåSOP Vla≈°im, 113 pp. =Life cycle = In Europe, it has usually 2 generations per year and snails can live up to 2 years. Jackiewicz M.

They are hatching from eggs. The shape of egg cluster is rounded to oval shape even when containing more eggs. There are usually 2-15 eggs in cluster. = Parasites = Galba truncatula is an intermediate host for these known trematodes and nematodes: * Fasciola hepatica * Fasciola gigantica * Fascioloides magna * Haplometra cylindracea * Plagiorchis spp. * Opisthioglyphe spp. * Calicophoron daubneyi * Muellerius capillaris Transmission capacity of fascioliasis to humans and to animals is high.

He was known as one of the strongest supporters of restrictions on immigration, but his campaign ended when he lost his seat in 1964. Commercial life Pannell attended Sir George Monoux Grammar School in Walthamstow, but left at the age of 16 to go into business. He worked for various companies in London and Paris, before joining John Holt & Co (Liverpool) Ltd in 1930 as a district agent in Nigeria. He married Isabel Morris in 1932. In 1937 he was made a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries, and the next year accepted a promotion to coast inspector. Pannell served on the Nigerian Legislative Council from 1944. Liverpool In 1945, he resigned from the Nigerian Legislative Council and moved to Liverpool where he was a finance manager for a firm of West African merchants and shipowners for five years. Pannell became involved with the Conservative Party in the city; at the 1951 general election he was Conservative candidate in Liverpool Scotland, and in 1952 was elected to Liverpool City Council. He was a governor of Liverpool Blue Coat School from 1953. Election to Parliament Pannell was selected as Conservative candidate for the constituency of Liverpool Kirkdale at the 1955 general election, a marginal seat which was held by Labour. With the help of favourable boundary changes he won by 1,814 votes. As a backbench MP, Pannell specialised in Commonwealth issues; in May 1956 he initiated an adjournment debate in which he called attention to the effect on the British economy if newly independent colonies spent their sterling balances outside the sterling area. He welcomed political development in colonies such as Gold Coast, but called for constitutional safeguards to protect the economy and make it safe for investment. Immigration issue Over the Suez crisis, Pannell supported the government and later opposed the policy of withdrawal from the canal zone; he was one of 14 (eight of whom had resigned the Conservative whip) to abstain on a vote endorsing the Government's policy in May 1957. Later that year he began a campaign to change the terms on which Commonwealth citizens were allowed to enter the United Kingdom, arguing that seventy percent of those convicted of living off immoral earnings in London were citizens of other Commonwealth countries or the Republic of Ireland. He came back to this issue after race riots in Nottingham in August 1958, calling also for general immigration control. However, he failed to persuade the Government and in April 1959, his amendment to the Street Offences Bill to allow deportation was rejected by 8 votes to 22 in Standing Committee. He successfully moved a motion at the 1958 Conservative Party conference to bring in immigration controls. Pannell was on the board of the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation from December 1958. In April 1959 he initiated a debate on the status of smaller territories within the Commonwealth, calling for them not to be forced to adopt Parliamentary democracy because it allowed politicians \\"to play on the emotions of an immature electorate\\". He also pressed for the flying of the St George's flag from government buildings on St George's Day. Further campaigning After re-election with an increased majority at the 1959 general election, Pannell became more involved on the issue of restricting immigration. In July 1960 he led a delegation to see Home Secretary R.A. Butler, calling for all immigrants to produce a certificate of good health and an assurance that they had a job to go to. In April 1961 he was a key mover in an amendment which unsuccessfully urged the reintroduction of corporal punishment for young offenders. His concern about the Commonwealth led him to oppose British entry to the Common Market when it was proposed in 1962. Pannell introduced a Private Member's Bill in 1962 to end the right of Irish citizens to vote in United Kingdom elections, although it did not make progress. He did not back the Macmillan government over the Profumo affair. He remained very active in calling for immigration restrictions, often linking the issue to unemployment and the crime rate. In April 1964 he called for the use of high pressure fire hoses to stop hooligans. Defeat At the 1964 general election, Pannell lost his seat to Labour. He was keen to stand again to try to regain his position, and was mentioned as a possible Conservative candidate in the Birmingham Hall Green by-election in 1965, although this came to nothing. He was a joint author with Lord Brockway of \\"Immigration ‚Äì What is the Answer?\\" in 1965, putting forward the case for restrictions while Brockway advocated allowing continued immigration. Local politics In the event Pannell did not fight the 1966 general election, although he was re-elected to Liverpool City Council in 1967 and became Chairman of the Education Committee. He served three years; as he was living at Heswall on the Wirral Peninsula, he was elected to Cheshire County Council in 1970. When the Wirral became part of Merseyside, Pannell was elected to the Metropolitan County Council in 1973, and remained a member until his death three years later. He also has a school in Netherley Liverpool named in his honour.

Castor Jr. (born October 24, 1961) is an American lawyer and retired Republican politician from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. He was appointed as the first Solicitor General of Pennsylvania on March 21, 2016, and First Deputy Attorney General on July 20, 2016, effectively merging the two positions and making him next in line of succession to become attorney general. Castor became Acting Attorney General less than a month later. After serving stints beginning in 1981 with, respectively, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office, the Northampton County (PA) District Attorney's Office, as an LBJ Congressional Scholar (Washington, DC) and defending Federal prisoners at FCI-Alderson (WV), Castor began his professional career as an assistant district attorney in 1985 before becoming district attorney of Montgomery County from 2000 to 2008. He next took a seat on the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, an elected position he held until January 4, 2016, when he was succeeded by Joe Gale. Castor was defeated for re-election as Montgomery County's District Attorney in November 2015. Castor is a partner in the law firm of Rogers Castor and completed a nearly three year term as a special assistant district attorney of Centre County, Pennsylvania on December 31, 2017, followed by an appointment as a special assistant district attorney of Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania on January 6, 2018. On March 29, 2016, Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced Castor's appointment (back-dated to March 21, when he actually took office) to the newly-created position of Solicitor General of Pennsylvania. While he operated freely as the de facto Attorney General and was widely recognized as such, Castor formally became the state's Acting Attorney General, replacing Kane, who resigned on August 17, 2016, following a conviction of a third degree felony perjury charge and several related misdemeanors. _Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Kathleen Granahan Kane_ (2015) CP-46-CR-0006239-2015 Governor Tom Wolf later nominated Bruce Beemer to fulfill the remaining balance of Kane's term which expired in January 2017. Statewide profile According to multiple reports, Castor explored a bid for Governor of Pennsylvania in 2014. A May 6, 2013, report in The Legal Intelligencer also mentioned Castor as a possible appointee to a vacant position on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Castor issued a public statement that he would not run for governor in 2014, but would accept the supreme court appointment if it was offered.http://www.politicspa.com/brucecastor-com-and-other-moves-by-the- montco-commish/46391/ Eventually, Tom Corbett, who had defeated Castor in the 2004 Republican primary for Attorney General (as discussed below), and later became governor of Pennsylvania, ended up being the only Republican governor's office or Republican U.S. Senate seat to change parties in the 2014 general election. This created speculation that if state Republican leaders, as had Castor, recognized the un-electibility of the incumbent, the GOP would have had a chance to hold the office with Castor or another Republican candidate. Montgomery County District Attorney After serving in the office since 1985, Castor was twice elected district attorney for Montgomery County, in which he is a lifelong resident, assuming office in January 2000. After his second term ended, he was succeeded by Risa Vetri Ferman. When she sought (and won) election as judge in November 2015, Castor sought to return to that office, but lost to Ferman's first assistant, Kevin Steele, who ran an 11th- hour campaign contending Castor should have charged entertainer Bill Cosby in 2005. Castor countered that Steele could have arrested Cosby himself in the intervening years if he believed credible evidence existed to do so. A week before the election, Andrea Constand, who had accused Cosby of sexual assault in Montgomery County, sued Castor, claiming he defamed her by intimating she was not credible.http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20151104_Steele_tops_Castor_in_contentious_Montco_DA_race.html The Washington Post said that this suit contributed to Castor's defeat. In November 2017, Castor sued Costand and her lawyers for defamation, charging that the lawsuit and its timing were retaliatory and ruined his political career. In 2017, Cosby stood trial, but the trial ended in a hung jury with jurors unable to agree on Cosby's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, as Castor had predicted in 2005 would happen if he had elected to charge Cosby. However at Cosby‚Äôs retrial he was convicted on all three counts and has been sentenced to serve 3 to 10 years in prison. =Notable cases= *Bill Cosby - Castor declined to prosecute Cosby for sexual assault in 2005 after he found \\"insufficient, credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" Prosecutors end Cosby investigation, CNN, 2/22/05 In November, 2014 and through the November 2015 election, Castor's decision was heavily criticized, especially when other women came forward to accuse Cosby. Castor, however, assessed that none of these women known to him at the time would have been allowed to testify, making them legally irrelevant to the question of whether Castor should have arrested Cosby. A judge in 2017 confirmed the correctness of Castor's legal analysis.http://6abc.com/politics/cosby-accuser-files-lawsuit- against-montco-da-candidate-bruce- castor/1052549/http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2015/11/03/3718388/cosby- election-pennsylvania/ On December 30, 2015, with the statute of limitations about to expire, Cosby was charged with felony sexual assault. At a preliminary hearing on February 2, 2016, Castor testified that he made a promise to never prosecute Cosby for the incident, but Judge Steven T. O'Neill (whom Castor had defeated to become district attorney in 1999 in a bitterly fought intra-party contest) ruled that the promise was not legally binding on the current district attorney, and ordered that the criminal case to proceed. *Dillon Cossey - Planned a Columbine-style attack on a local high school.

Furious that he had lost endorsements of the southeastern GOP chairmen, Castor attacked Corbett and the county chairmen with allegations of backroom deals with Bob Asher, the state's national GOP committeeman. Castor and Asher had feuded for several years due to Asher's prior felony convictions for perjury, bribery, racketeering, and conspiracy in 1986 in the context of a political corruption scandal which also involved the State Treasurer, R. Budd Dwyer, leading to Dwyer's committing suicide at a press conference before his sentencing. Asher had been state GOP Chair during the scandal and was convicted for participating in the bribery of Dwyer. Asher's criminal past, connected to a political bribery scheme while he was the Rubublican state chair, became a subject of the campaign for the state's top law enforcement post. Castor was unable to produce proof of any conspiracy against him and ran without the party endorsement in all but two counties, his home base in Montgomery County and Monroe County. Castor lost 52.8% to 47.2%, despite winning overwhelmingly the same southeastern counties whose chairmen had repudiated him, and his home in Montgomery County, where he took nearly 82.5% of the vote.Election Returns, May 2004, PA Department of State Corbett, Eisenhower win in attorney general race, Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, 4/28/04 The 2004 GOP Attorney General Primary was of great significance in Pennsylvania politics as it pitted Corbett against Castor, a candidate from Asher's home county. The immediate result of that election was to show the supremacy of Asher in Statewide GOP politics and Castor as only a regional politician popular only in South East Pennsylvania. It was widely speculated at the time that the 2004 GOP primary for Attorney General would produce the eventual GOP nominee for governor in 2010. In fact, that speculation turned out to be true when Corbett was nominated for governor in 2010 and subsequently elected before becoming the first governor in PA history to lose for re-election four years later in what was otherwise an overwhelming Republican year nationwide. The long term fallout from the 2004 GOP Attorney General Primary election was the alienation of the more moderate Republicans from South East Pennsylvania from Republicans in the rest of the state, creating a fissure in the party. As a result, by 2014, the GOP had lost all statewide elected (non-judicial) posts but one, including failing to re-elect Corbett, a disaster for the Pennsylvania GOP leadership. In addition, the GOP, while controlling handily both houses of the Pennsylvania Legislature, cast out of leadership almost all members of their own party representing districts from the SE part of the state. Thus, the 2004 GOP primary for Attorney General now is considered to have been a pivotal election for Pennsylvania as it split the Republican Party, with the more polarizing conservative wing taking dominance. This has led to the nomination of candidates unable to win general elections by not appealing to SE PA voters and the designation of Pennsylvania as a firmly \\"blue\\" state. In 2016, Donald Trump carried Pennsylvania and GOP Senator Pat Toomey was re-elected. However, state Democrats won all three statewide \\"row office\\" races. Private practice When his term as district attorney expired in January 2008, Castor took a position at the litigation firm of Elliott, Greenleaf & Siedzikowski in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania as a shareholder and director. One of his notable clients was professional basketball player Marko Jaric of the Memphis Grizzlies, who was accused of sexual assault in Philadelphia. Jaric was not charged in the case. In 2009, Castor represented Mark Sargent, who was investigated (but not charged) for patronizing a brothel while he served as dean of the Villanova University School of Law. In 2010, Castor represented his former boss, attorney Michael D. Marino, whose nephew accidentally shot and killed a man while hunting. Marino, a former Montgomery County D.A., was present when the shooting occurred, despite knowing that his nephew was prohibited from owning and using firearms, owing to a felony conviction. Marino was not charged in the case. On July 1, 2013, Castor joined the law firm of Rogers & Associates (subsequently renamed Rogers Castor) as a partner where he continues his now only civil- litigation practice in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, with former Lower Merion Commissioner and former Republican state senate nominee, Lance Rogers. Montgomery County Commissioner In 2007, Castor challenged incumbent County Commissioner Tom Ellis, a one-time friend who had chaired Castor's campaigns in 1999 and 2003 but endorsed Corbett in 2004. Early in the campaign, Castor commissioned a poll showing that Ellis, who had been hobbled by negative press surrounding alleged domestic violence incidents, would lose in a general election. Ellis released his own poll to try to refute Castor's charges that he was unelectable. In a six candidate field, Castor won the party endorsement on the first ballot, but his preferred running mate, former State Representative Melissa Murphy Weber, was narrowly defeated by incumbent Jim Matthews on the second ballot. Initially, Castor was reluctant to run with Matthews saying he believed Matthews was \\"untrustworthy.\\" However, amid widespread pressure that he would be splitting the party, Castor relented and ran with Matthews against former Democratic Congressman Joe Hoeffel and incumbent commissioner Ruth Damsker in the general election. During the campaign, some of Castor's earlier criticism of Matthews was raised by the Democrats, including financial support to Matthews from Bob Asher. Over Castor's objections who would not accept funds from a convicted felon, Matthews set up a separate campaign account from the Matthews/Castor account in order to collect contributions from Asher. On election day, Castor won, taking first place in the general election setting an electoral record at the time for the position. His running mate placed third, giving the GOP control of the commission. This was the first time in at least 140 years that a Republican failed to capture both the first and the second spot. Castor and Matthews served with Hoeffel, who finished second. It was immediately a rocky relationship with all Castor's earlier predictions about Matthews being \\"untrustworthy\\" coming true. Matthews and Hoeffel sided against Castor shutting him out of setting county policy. Castor responded by repeatedly making allegations of corruption against his fellow commissioners charging mismanagement of county finances, the hiring of unqualified people, and in the conduct of county business. A subsequent grand jury report found questionable behavior on Hoeffel's part for his participation in discussing county business at private breakfast meetings held with Matthews and senior aides-an alleged violation of state \\"sunshine\\" laws. However, unlike Matthews, who was later arrested for allegedly perjuring himself while testifying to the grand jury, Hoeffel was never charged with criminal wrongdoing. Nevertheless, Matthews and Hoeffel were unable to achieve endorsement for re-election and dropped out of the race, while GOP voters easily re-nominated Castor who was thus vindicated in his allegations of government corruption and mismanagement by Hoeffel and Matthews. On November 8, 2011, St. Rep. Josh Shapiro, Whitemarsh Twp. Supervisor Leslie Richards, and Castor were elected, marking the first time in county history Democrats controlled two of the three seats on the Board of Commissioners. Shapiro was elected chairman unanimously on nomination from Castor. All three members of the commission later noted the improved level of civility and functionality on the board, with Castor expressing pride in working with Shapiro and Richards whom he considered \\"honest.\\" The relationship amongst the three commissioners later prompted one columnist of The Philadelphia Inquirer to note that she owed Castor an apology for considering his complaints about the prior county administration \\"sour grapes\\". Shapiro and Castor are both frequently mentioned as possible gubernatorial candidates, though each declined to run in 2014, preferring to use their positions along with Richards to fix the problems left them by the prior administration. In 2014‚Äì15, rumors swirled that Castor would seek to return to his old post as district attorney or run for county judge. Those rumors turned out to be correct when Castor for a third time received the Republican nomination for district attorney on May 19, 2015. The news was met with widespread approval from law enforcement groups and members of the legal community, with the general consensus being Castor was far more effective as DA than as commissioner in first a corrupt administration, and later while helping to repair the damage wrought by that corruption. In response, Castor simply maintained that while he liked working with Shapiro, he missed his old job too much. On November 3, 2015, Castor was defeated in his effort to return to the district attorney's post and Joe Gale was elected to succeed Castor as county commissioner. Upon retiring from county service after 30 years on January 4, 2016, Castor began practicing law full-time with the Rogers Castor firm as a trial lawyer. Solicitor general and acting attorney general On March 21, 2016, Castor took the oath of office as the first Solicitor General of Pennsylvania. Being summoned to her Scranton office by Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen G. Kane on March 4, 2016, without explanation, Castor met General Kane expecting her to request him to represent her in a private capacity. Instead, Kane offered him the newly created position of Solicitor General of Pennsylvania (later merged into the job of first deputy attorney general), and Castor accepted. As solicitor general, Castor was empowered to make all final legal decisions of the Office of Attorney General and in all other respects operate as \\"the most senior deputy attorney general of the Commonwealth\\" according to the order creating the position. The move was necessitated because the Attorney General had her license to practice law suspended by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Castor was supposedly subordinate to Kane in all matters except for making legal decisions on behalf of Pennsylvania, though most observers considered him the de facto attorney general, a fact later confirmed upon Kane's resignation. In practice, Castor operated as a bridge between Kane and the remainder of the office of attorney general, in addition to being the final word on legal matters, in order to make the executive portion of the office function properly. However, following Democrat Kathleen Kane's sudden resignation, Republican Castor was sworn in as Acting Attorney General of Pennsylvania, no longer simply de facto attorney general, though later that week Democrat Governor Tom Wolf nominated Democrat Inspector General Bruce Beemer to serve the remainder of Kane's term. The Pennsylvania Senate confirmed the nomination quickly. After Castor assumed the office of Acting Attorney General, he was the subject of criticism,http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/08/bruce_castor_kathleen_kane.html and on August 30, 2016, Bruce Beemer succeeded Castor as attorney general.

It was influential in advancing sociological theories and thought, with ideas which in turn were influenced by Auguste Comte. Durkheim described how social order was maintained in societies based on two very different forms of solidarity ‚Äì mechanical and organic ‚Äì and the transition from more \\"primitive\\" societies to advanced industrial societies. Durkheim suggested that in a \\"primitive\\" society, mechanical solidarity, with people acting and thinking alike and with a shared collective conscience, is what allows social order to be maintained. In such a society, Durkheim viewed crime as an act that \\"offends strong and defined states of the collective conscience\\" though he viewed crime as a normal social fact.Durkheim, Emile. The Division of Labour in Society. Trans. W. D. Halls, intro. Lewis A. Coser. New York: Free Press, 1997, pp. 39, 60, 108. Because social ties are relatively homogeneous and weak throughout a mechanical society, the law has to be repressive and penal to respond to offences of the common conscience. In an advanced, industrial, capitalist society, the complex system of division of labour means that people are allocated in society according to merit and rewarded accordingly: social inequality reflects natural inequality, at least in the case that there is complete equity in the society. Durkheim argued that moral regulation was needed, as well as economic regulation, to maintain order (or organic solidarity) in society. In fact this regulation forms naturally in response to the division of labor, allowing people to \\"compose their differences peaceably\\".Rock, Paul (2002). \\"Sociological Theories of Crime\\" in Maguire, Mike, Rod Morgan, and Robert Reiner, The Oxford Handbook of Criminology. Oxford University Press. In this type of society, law would be more restitutive than penal, seeking to restore rather than punish excessively. He thought that transition of a society from \\"primitive\\" to advanced may bring about major disorder, crisis, and anomie. However, once society has reached the \\"advanced\\" stage, it becomes much stronger and is done developing. Unlike Karl Marx, Durkheim did not foresee any different society arising out of the industrial capitalist division of labour. He regarded conflict, chaos, and disorder as pathological phenomena to modern society, whereas Marx highlights class conflict.

The Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) is a public transit agency providing bus service in the southern portion of Santa Barbara County, California. It serves the cities of Santa Barbara, Carpinteria, and Goleta as well as the unincorporated areas of Montecito, Summerland, and Isla Vista. History Mule-powered street railways were implemented in 1875 and were gradually replaced by electric streetcars in 1896. The streetcars made their last run on July 1, 1929; about a month later, the Santa Barbara Transit Corporation company started providing local bus service (H.A.

Princess Vera Constantinovna of Russia, also Vera Konstantinovna (; 24 April 1906 - 11 January 2001), was the youngest child of Grand Duke Konstantine Konstantinovich of Russia and his wife, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna. A great-granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, she was born in the Russian Empire and was a childhood playmate of the younger children of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 132 She lost much of her family during World War I and the Russian Revolution. At age twelve, she escaped revolutionary Russia, fleeing with her mother and brother George to Sweden. She spent the rest of her long life in exile, first in Western Europe and from the 1950s in the United States. Early life Princess Vera Konstantinovna of Russia circa 1914-17 Princess Vera Konstantinovna of Russia was born at Pavlovsk on 24 April 1906. She was the youngest child among the nine children of Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia and his wife Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna, born Princess Elizabeth of Saxe- Altenburg. She was going to be named Marianne in honor of her mother's favorite sister, Princess Marie Anne of Saxe-Altenburg, but her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia insisted that her niece should be named after her.Vera Constantinovna, Kadetskaya pereklichka Her godparents were her brother Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. Vera Constantinovna spent her first years in fabulous splendour during the last period of Imperial Russia. Her father, a respected poet, was a second cousin once removed of Tsar Nicholas II. Princess Vera was eight years old when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated and World War I broke out, in the summer of 1914. Vera was with her parents and her brother George in Germany visiting her maternal relatives in Altenburg at the start of the war. The conflict took them by surprise, trapping them in Germany, an enemy country. It was thanks to the intervention of the German Empress, Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein that they were allowed to return to Russia.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 154 Vera's older siblings joined the Russian army in the military effort, and her favorite brother Oleg was killed in action. She was considered too young and was not allowed to attend her brother's funeral. Her brother's death was just the first of many family misfortunes. The following year, her father died of a heart attack in her presence. In a letter to her brother, she later described how she was sitting with her father in his study, when Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich began gasping. Princess Vera managed to push open a heavy door between her parents' studies, pushing aside several heavy plants that stood in front of the door, and ran to her mother crying that her father couldn't breathe. Her mother ran after her, but the grand duke had already died.Zeepvat, Charlotte, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 185 Revolution Left to right back row: Princess Tatiana; Prince Gabriel; Prince Ivan; Grand Duchess Elizabeta Mavrikievna and Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich. Front row: Princess Vera; Prince George; Prince Igor; Prince Oleg and Prince Constantine, 1911. After the death of her father, in 1916, Vera moved with her mother and her brother George to the Marble Palace in Petrograd, leaving Pavlovsk to her eldest brother Prince Ivan Konstantinovich. During the chaotic rule of the Provisional Government, and after the October Revolution, Princess Vera, her mother, and her brother George, remained at Pavlovsk.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 164 For a time, they lived a precarious existence, and her mother was forced to secretly sell family heirlooms to provide for the family. They stayed in the palace until the summer of 1918, when the revolution forced them to leave it and to take an apartment in the city. During the Russian revolution, four of Vera's brothers were imprisoned by the Bolsheviks. Only Prince Gabriel was eventually released. Three of her brothers (Ivan, Constantine and Igor) were killed at Alapaevsk, along with other Romanov relatives, in July 1918. Initially, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna was reluctant to leave Russia remembering her late husband's words, that if Russia was in need, it was a Romanov's duty to help. However, with their situation becoming increasingly dangerous, she accepted an offer made by her friend, Queen Victoria of Sweden, through the Swedish Ambassador Edvard Br√§ndstr√∂m, to travel to Sweden. From Kronstadt twelve-year-old Princess Vera escaped to Sweden aboard the Swedish vessel √Öngermanland in October 1918 with her mother, her brother George, and her young nephews (Prince Teymuraz Constantinovich and Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia) and nieces (Princess Natalia Konstantinovna Bagration-Mukhransky and Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia) when they were permitted by the Bolsheviks to be taken by ship to Sweden, via Tallinn to Helsinki and via Mariehamn to Stockholm, at the invitation of Queen Victoria of Sweden. At Stockholm harbor, they met Prince Gustaf Adolf, who took them to the royal palace. Later, Vsevolod and Catherine were able to reunite to their mother. Exile On the sofa: Princess Tatiana with her children Teymuraz and Nathalie Bagration-Mukhransky and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna. On the floor: Prince George and Princess Vera. Brussels, 1921. Princess Vera lived with her mother and her brother George for the next two years in Sweden, first in Stockholm and then in Saltsj√∂baden. As Sweden proved too expensive to live in, Elizabeth Mavrikievna wrote a letter to Albert I of Belgium, asking him to allow them to move to his country. In 1920 they relocated to Brussels where they were frequently ill. In 1922, Vera's uncle, Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Altenburg invited them to move to Germany. Elizabeth Mavrikievna settled in the ancestral castle of her family near Leipzig, in the small town of Altenburg. Princess Vera followed her mother half a year later after spending sometime in Oberstdorf in the Allg√§u region of the Bavarian Alps recuperating from tuberculosis. Her mother died of cancer on 24 March 1927 in Leipzig. Left alone and without sufficient means of subsistence, Vera Constantinovna moved to Bavaria, with friends and shortly after relocated to London with her brother George. When two years later, George moved to the United States, she returned to Altenburg. Princess Vera lived there for thirty years. Prince George died in New York City in 1938. Princess Vera lived in Germany through the difficult years of World War II.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 190 During the War, she worked as a translator in a camp for prisoners of war. But German officials soon removed her from that position because she had tried to help fellow prisoners. For many years, as she later recalled, she was haunted by the events of the Revolution. \\"I used to have the same dream, as if I stood with my back to a pit and they were going to shoot me...my awakening was not less terrible than the dream itself, because I was constantly afraid to open my eyes and see that they had really come to take me to the execution\\". At the end of World War II, in early 1945, American troops arrived in Altenburg. On hearing that, according to the Potsdam Conference, Altenburg was going to be part of the zone of Soviet occupation, Princess Vera fled on foot. With her cousin, Prince Ernst-Friedrich Saxe-Altenburg, she had to walk 240 kilometers in 12 days, fleeing the advancing Soviet troops. Once safe, Princess Vera settled in Hamburg on 5 January 1946. Until 1949 she worked as a translator in the British branch of the Red Cross and later in the DP Medical Center. When this one was closed, she worked at the reception in another British institution. She belonged to no country, as she only had an ambiguous Nansen passport, which gave her the ability to travel but no protections of statehood. Despite this, she refused to take the protection offered to her by various European countries, considering herself Russian. \\" I didn't leave Russia\\", she once declared, \\"Russia left me\\". Last years Princess Vera Constantinovna in the 1970s In 1951 she moved to the United States, where her main activity was to work for the Tolstoy Foundation, which provided aid to Russians in need. For the next decades she lived in New York, and was very active in charities. In November 1952 Vera Constantinovna became involved in the work of the Russian Children's Welfare Society where she continued her work there until 1969. At the same time, she volunteered at the Fund of Assistance to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. She retired in April 1971. She regarded some of the √©migr√© community, and some of their pretensions, with skepticism. She did not have the nostalgic idyll of many √©migr√©s, but rather the memories of her childhood and her lost family.King & Wilson, Gilded Prism, p. 191 The constant stream of visitors she regarded with some amusement and found rather trying. She did not care for those who would speak in awe-struck tones of the late Imperial family; she would often relate stories of their humanness and misbehavior. For her, the children of the last Tsar remained her childhood playmates, not distant figures for adoration. She also regarded the canonization of the Romanovs, including her brothers and uncle, as a puzzling, peculiar move by the Church. Princess Vera wrote four short articles about her life for a magazine \\"Kadetskaya pereklichka\\" published by Union of the Russian Kadets in New York in 1972. Princess Vera retained a certain aura of living history, being the last surviving member of the Romanov family who could remember Imperial Russia. Her two brothers and sister who managed to escape Russia all predeceased her. Prince Gabriel died in 1955, leaving no heirs, as did her brother Prince George, the victim of an early death at the age of 33 in 1938. Her sister, Princess Tatiana, eventually took holy orders and became an Orthodox Nun. She died in Jerusalem in 1979. Princess Vera died at the Tolstoy Foundation's elderly care home in Valley Cottage, New York, on 11 January 2001, at the age of 95. She was buried next to her brother Prince Georgy Konstantinovich at the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox Monastery of Novo-Diveevo in Nanuet, New York. Of all the members of the Romanov family in Imperial Russia, only her niece Princess Catherine Ivanovna outlived her. Princess Vera never married and left no children. In the spring of 2007 the Pavlovsk Palace, where she was born, held an exhibit about her and her family, commemorating what would have been her 101st birthday.

Early life Lord Ronald was born 2 August 1845. He was the youngest son of eleven children, seven daughters and four sons, born to George, 2nd Duke of Sutherland (and 20th Earl) by his wife Lady Harriet Howard. His surviving siblings included Lady Elizabeth Georgiana (1824‚Äì1878), who married the 8th Duke of Argyll, Lady Evelyn Gower (1825‚Äì1869), who married the 12th Lord Blantyre, Lady Caroline Gower (1827‚Äì1887), who married the 4th Duke of Leinster, George Gower (1828‚Äì1892), who became the 3rd Duke of Sutherland, Lady Constance Gower (1834‚Äì1880), who married the 1st Duke of Westminster, Lord Albert Gower (1843‚Äì1874), married Grace Abdy. His paternal grandparents were George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland and his wife Elizabeth Gordon, de jure Countess of Sutherland. His maternal grandparents were George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle and Lady Georgiana Cavendish (1783‚Äì1858), herself the daughter of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire and Lady Georgiana Spencer. He was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Career From 1867‚Äì1874, he was a Liberal Member of Parliament for Sutherland. He made only one speech in the House, even though he held the seat for many years. Reportedly, \\"it was with some relief that, with the resignation of Gladstone's government at the beginning of 1874, he relinquished\\" his seat. He was succeeded as MP by his nephew Cromartie, Marquess of Stafford (the elder surviving son of his eldest brother the 3rd Duke of Sutherland). He was a Trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, and of the Birthplace and Shakespeare Memorial Building at Stratford- on-Avon. In 1889, he travelled to America and donated several of his works to prominent American museums. =Creative work= Gower's statue of Hamlet in Stratford-upon-Avon A sculptor, he also published a number of works on the fine arts. Lord Ronald shared a studio in Sir Joshua Reynolds's old home in Leicester Square with John O'Connor, an Irish landscape painter and theatrical designer. In 1875, he travelled to Paris to begin sculpting in the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, one of the founding members of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. His most important sculpture was the statue of Shakespeare and four of his principal characters, erected in Stratford-upon- Avon. He also created a sculpture depicting Marie Antoinette on her way to the scaffold and another of a member of the Old Guard at Waterloo. He also wrote biographies of Marie Antoinette and Joan of Arc and a history of the Tower of London. He furthermore published Reminiscences which was a memoir of his upbringing and life. Personal life Gower's lover Frank Hird in 1894, chalk drawing by Henry Scott Tuke. Gower, who never married, was well known in the homosexual community of the time. Oscar Wilde's story The Portrait of Mr. W. H. has been interpreted as a comment on Gower's social circle, and Gower is generally identified as the model for Lord Henry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray.David Getsy, Sculpture and the Pursuit of a Modern Ideal in Britain, C. 1880-1930, Asgate, London, 2004, p.64. In 1879, hints of his homosexual liaisons published in the journal Man of the World led Gower to sue the paper, but later in the year the Prince of Wales sent him a letter accusing him of being \\"a member of an association for unnatural practices\\", to which Gower wrote an angry reply. John Addington Symonds, who stayed with him once, stated that Gower \\"saturates one's spirit in Urningthum [homosexuality] of the rankest most diabolical kind\\". His most notable relationship was with the journalist Frank Hird (1873‚Äì1937), which lasted to the end of Gower's life. Gower later adopted Hird as his son, leading Wilde to remark on one occasion: \\"Frank may be seen, but not Hird.\\" They are buried together at St Paul's Parish Church, Rusthall, Kent. Lord Ronald Gower died on 9 March 1916 at his home in Tunbridge Wells, a town in western Kent, England, about south- east of central London. =1890 scandal= In 1890, Gower was implicated in the Cleveland Street Scandal. The Cleveland Street Scandal itself took place in 1889 when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, London was discovered by police. Among others, it was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and 2nd in line to the British throne, had visited the brothel.Aronson, p. 177 In 1890, Lord Ronald as well as Lord Errol were implicated,\\"The London Scandals\\", The Press (New Zealand), Volume XLVI, Issue 7418, 9 December 1889, Page 6 along with the prominent social figure Alexander Meyrick Broadley,\\"The West End Scandal: Another Flight\\", Evening News (Sydney, Australia), Tuesday 14 January 1890\\"Another London Society Leader Gone\\", The Salt Lake Herald, Wednesday 1 January 1890 who fled abroad for four years.\\"La Marquise de Fontenoy\\" (pseudonym of Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen), Chicago Tribune, 8 May 1916\\"Vanity Fair\\" by J.M.D., The Australasian (Melbourne), 22 September 1894 The Paris Figaro even alleged that Broadley took General Georges Boulanger and Henri Rochefort to the house.\\"Boulanger Mixed Up in a Scandal\\", Chicago Tribune, 2 February 1890, p. 4 =1913 scandal= In 1913, Francis R. Shackleton (brother of the famed Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton) was charged with defrauding Gower of his fortune. Reportedly, Lord Ronald entrusted Shackleton with $25,000 for him to invest in 1910. Shackleton induced Lord Ronald to purchase 5,000 shares in the City of Montevideo Public Works Corporation, which were essentially worthless shares that only benefited Shackleton. The amount stolen by Shackleton was later claimed to be upwards of $200,000 from Lord Ronald and $30,000 from his \\"confidential friend\\"; Frank Hird. It was alleged that Shackleton initially met Ronald in 1905 and Hird in 1907, whom The New York Times referred to as Lord Ronald's adopted son. Due to the loss, he was forced to sell his country house, Hammerfield at Penshurst in Kent, to Arnold Hills. References ;Notes ;Sources * Aronson, Theo (1994).

This digital central office telephone circuit switching system is used in the former GTE service areas and by many smaller telecommunications service providers. History The GTD-5 EAX first appeared in Banning, California on June 26, 1982,\\"100 Years of Telephone Switching\\",Robert J. Chapuis, A. E. Joel, Jr., Amos E. Joel,p. 392 slowly replacing the electromechanical systems still in use in the independent switch market at that time. The GTD-5 EAX was also used as a Class 4 telephone switch or as a mixed Class 4/5 in markets too small for a GTD-3 EAX or 4ESS switch. The GTD-5 EAX was also exported internationally, and manufactured outside of the U.S. under license, primarily in Canada, Belgium and Italy. By 1988, it had 4% of the worldwide switching market, with an installed base of 11,000,000 subscriber lines.Electronic Materials Handbook, Merrill L. Minges, ASM International Handbook Committee, pg. 384, table 1. GTE Automatic Electric Laboratories became GTE Network Systems and later GTE Communication Systems. In 1989, GTE sold partial ownership of its switching division to AT&T;, forming AG Communication Systems. AG Communication Systems eventually fell under the ownership of Lucent Technologies, and was dissolved as a separate corporate entity in 2003. Architecture =Processor complexes= The processing building block of the GTD-5 EAX was the \\"processor complex\\". These were each assigned a specific function within the overall switch design. In the original generation, Intel 8086 processors were used. These were replaced by NEC V30s (an 80186 instruction set compatible processor with 8086 pinout implemented in CMOS and somewhat faster than the 8086 due to internal improvements) in the second generation, and ultimately by 80386 processors. ;Administrative Processor Complex (APC) The APC was responsible for the craft interface to the system, administration of status control for all hardware devices, Recent Change, billing, and overall administration. ;Telephony Processor Complex (TPC) The TPC was responsible for call sequence and state control. It received signalling inputs collected from peripheral processors (see MXU, RLU, RSU, and TCU below) and sent control information back to the peripheral processors. ;Base Processor Complex (BPC) This term referred collectively to the APC and TPCs. Physically, this distinction made little sense, but was important from a software compilation standpoint. Since the APC and TPC processors shared a large memory-mapped space, some stages of compilation were performed in common. ;Timeswitch and Peripheral Control Unit (TCU) The TCU was responsible for a group of Facility Interface Units (FIUs). Each FIU was responsible for connecting the system to a particular class of physical connection: analog lines in the Analog Line FIU (and its successor, the Extended Line FIU); analog trunks in the Analog Trunk FIU; and digital carrier in the Digital Trunk FIU and its successor, the EDT FIU. Unlike the SM in the competitive 5ESS Switch, the TCUs did not perform all call processing functions, but limited themselves to digit collection and signalling interpretation. ;Remote Switching Unit (RSU) The RSU was similar to the TCU, but had a network capable of local switching, and could process calls locally when links to the base unit were severed. ;Remote Line Unit (RLU) The RLU was a condensed version of the RSU, with no local switching capability and limited line capacity. ;MultipleXor Unit (MXU) The MXU was actually a Lenkurt 914E Subscriber Loop Carrier. When integrated with the GTD-5 EAX, it used a custom software load that permitted message communication with the remainder of the system. =Internal communication= Most communication within the GTD-5 was performed via direct memory-mapped I/O. The APC and each TPC were each connected to three common memory units. These common memory units each contained 16 megabytes of memory which were allocated to shared data structures, both dynamic structures related to dynamic call data and static (protected) data related to the office database. The APC, TPC, and TCUs all connected to a smaller shared memory, the Message Distribution Circuit (MDC). This was an 8k word 96 port memory that was used to place small packetized messages into software defined queues. The MXU, RLU, and RSU were all sufficiently far from the base unit that they could not participate in the shared memory based communication directly. A special circuit pack, the Remote Data Link Controller (RDLC) was installed in the DT-FIU of the remote unit and its host TCU. This allowed a serial communication link over a dedicated timeslot of a DS1 carrier. The host TCU was responsible for forwarding messages from the remote unit through the MDC. =Network= Two generations of network were available on the GTD-5. The latter network was made available sometime around 2000, but its characteristics are not described in public documentation. The network described in the article is the original network, available from 1982 until approximately 2000. The GTD-5 EAX ran on a Time- Space-Time (TST) topology. Each TCU contained two timeswitches (TSWs) with a total capacity of 1544 timeslots: 772 in the originating time switch and 772 in the terminating time switch. Four FIUs of 193 timeslots each were connected to the TSW. Trunking FIUs connected 192 timeslots of facility (eight DS1 carriers or 192 individual analog trunks). The original Analog Line FIU had a 768 line capacity with one codec per line. The digital output of the 768 codecs was concentrated to 192 timeslots before presentation to the timeswitch, a 4:1 concentration. In the later 1980s, higher capacity line frames of 1172 and 1536 lines became available, allowing for higher concentration ratios of 6:1 and 8:1. The Space Switch (SSW) was under the control of the TPCs and APC, which accessed it via the Space Interface Controller (SIC). The SSW was divided into eight Space Switch Units (SSUs). Each SSU could switch all 772 channels between 32 TCUs. The first 32 TCUs connected in sequential order to the first two SSUs. Connecting the two SSUs in parallel this way provided the doubling of network capacity required in a CLOS network. When the system grew beyond 32 TCUs, an additional 6 SSUs were added. Two of these SSUs connected to TCU32-TCU63 in a manner directly analogous to the first two SSUs. Two connected the inputs from TCU0-TCU31 to the output of TCU32-TCU63, while the final two connected the outputs of TCU32-TCU63 to the input of TCU0-TCU31. The GTD-5, unlike its contemporaries, did not make extensive use of serial line technology. Network communication was based on a 12-bit parallel PCM word\\"100 Years of Telephone Switching\\",Robert J. Chapuis, A. E. Joel, Jr., Amos E. Joel,p. 391 carried over cables incorporating parallel twisted pairs. Communication between processors and peripherals was memory mapped, with similar cables extending 18 bit address and data buses between frames. Analog line FIU (AL-FIU) The AL-FIU contained 8 simplex groups of 96 lines each, referred to as Analog Line Units (ALUs), controlled by a redundant controller, the Analog Control Unit (ACU). The 96 lines within each ALU were housed on 12 circuit packs of eight line circuits. These 12 circuit packs were electrically grouped into four groups of three cards, where each group of three cards shared a serial 24 timeslot PCM group. The timeslot assignment capabilities of the codec were used to manage timeslots within the PCM group. The ACU contained a timeslot selection circuit that could select the same timeslot from up to eight PCM groups, (i.e. network timeslot 0-7 would select PCM timeslot 0, network timeslot 8-15 would select PCM timeslot 1, etc., giving eight opportunities for PCM timeslot 0 to connect to network). Since the same timeslot could be selected only eight times out of thirty-two possible candidates, the overall concentration was four to one. A later generation expanded the number of ALUs to twelve or sixteen, as appropriate, giving larger effective concentration. Analog trunk FIU (AT-FIU) The AT-FIU was a repackaged AL-FIU. Only two simplex groups were supported, and the trunk cards carried four circuits instead of eight. PCM groups were six cards wide instead of three. Since two simplex groups provided a total of 192 trunks, the AT-FIU was unconcentrated, as trunk interfaces demand. Digital trunk FIU (DT-FIU) T-carrier spans were terminated, four per card, on the Quad Span Interface Circuit (QSIC) in Digital Trunk Facility Interface Units (DTUs). Two QSICS were equipped per copy. providing for an eight DS1 capacity. The span interface circuits were completely redundant, and all control circuitry operated in lockstep between the two copies. This arrangement provided for excellent failure detection but was plagued by design flaws in the earliest versions. Corrected versions of the design were not widely available until the early 1990s. The later generation Extended Digital Trunk Unit (EDT) included 8 T-carriers per card, and incorporated ESF and PRI interfaces. This FIU operated also operated in lockstep between the two copies, but incorporated a small backplane mounted \\"fingerboard\\" to house the transformer circuit. =Processor architecture= Throughout its lifecycle, the GTD-5 EAX incorporated a quad-redundant processor architecture. The main processor complex of the APC, TPC, TCU, RLU, and RSU all consisted of a pair of processor cards, and each of those processor cards contained a pair of processors. The on-card pair of processors executed precisely the same sequence of instructions, and the output of the pair were compared each clock cycle. If the results were not identical, the processors were immediately reset, and the pair of processors on the other card were brought online as the active processor complex. The active processor always kept memory up-to-date so that when these forced switches occurred, little data loss was suffered. When the switch was requested as a part of routine maintenance, the switch could be accomplished with no data loss at all. =Software architecture= The GTD-5 EAX was programmed in a custom version of Pascal.\\"100 Years of Telephone Switching\\",Robert J. Chapuis, A. E. Joel, Jr., Amos E. Joel,p. 51 This Pascal was extended to include a separate data and type compilation phase, known as the COMPOOL (Communications Pool). By enforcing this separate compilation phase, strict typing could be enforced across separate code compilation. This allowed type checking across procedure boundaries and across processor boundaries. A small subset of code was programmed in 8086 assembly language. The assembler used had a preprocessor that imported identifiers from the COMPOOL, allowing type compatibility checking between Pascal and assembly. The earliest peripherals were programmed in the assembly language appropriate to each processor. Eventually, most peripherals were programmed in variations of C and C++. Administration The system is administered through an assortment of teletypewriter \\"Channels\\" (also called the system console). Various outboard systems have been connected to these channels to provide specialized functions.

Since then, the company has grown from a small coffee shop into an international business with six offices worldwide. As well as the finest wines, such as en primeur from places like Bordeaux, Burgundy, the Rh√¥ne and Italy, the company also sells wines and spirits under its own- label range, Berry Bros. & Rudd's Own Selection. Other services it offers include wine investment, wine storage, wine tastings, events and educational courses. Berry Bros. & Rudd currently employs six Masters of Wine, more than any other company in the world. History No.3 St James's Street Berry Bros. & Rudd is Britain's oldest wine and spirits merchant, and one of the ten oldest family-run businesses in the UK. It was founded by the Widow Bourne in 1698 at 3 St. James's Street, London, which today is a Grade II* listed building still used as the company's headquarters. No.3, as it's known, contained Berry Bros. & Rudd's main retail premises until mid-2017, when these moved around the corner to a purpose-built shop at 63 Pall Mall. The company has a discounted store next to its main warehouse in Basingstoke, Hampshire and additional offices in Battersea, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company started out selling coffee, and then diversified into cocoa, tea, snuff, spices, and other exotic goods, quickly becoming one of London's most fashionable grocers. Its West End location and close proximity to St James's Palace also contributed to its growing popularity. In 1903 they formulated a ginger liqueur to revivify Edward VII from cold car journeys, still purveyed as The King's Ginger. During the years, it has counted many famous customers among its clientele including: Lord Byron, William Pitt the Younger, the Aga Khan and Beau Brummell. In 2020, Emma Fox took on the role of CEO from Lizzy Rudd, who had been serving as interim Chief Executive since the departure of Dan Jago in 2019. Lizzy Rudd remains the Chair of the Board of Directors. Window display at 4 St James's Street  Royal Warrants  Berry Bros. & Rudd has been the official wine supplier to the British Royal Family since the reign of King George III and received its first Royal Warrant of Appointment in 1903 from King Edward VII. Queen Elizabeth II granted the company her royal warrant in 1952, while Charles, Prince of Wales granted it his in 1998.  Basingstoke Warehouse  In 1967, the company moved its bottling operation and warehouse to purpose-built facilities in Basingstoke, Hampshire. In spring 2014, it relaunched its Warehouse Shop on the site of the former bottling hall, the shop now sells bin-end and reduced price wines and spirits alongside a fine wine collection.  Cutty Sark Whisky  In 1923 Berry Bros. & Rudd launched Cutty Sark Scotch whisky, whose yellow label became famous the world over. In 2010 the brand was sold to The Edrington Group; under the deal, Berry Bros. & Rudd acquired The Glenrothes single malt brand, which was then sold back to Edrington in 2017. Berry Bros. & Rudd's Broking Exchange (BBX) Berry Bros. & Rudd was the first wine merchant to open an online shop, launching bbr.com in 1995. Today it also has an online wine trading platform called BBX (Berry Bros. & Rudd's Broking Exchange).

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis The novel is primarily composed of three separate plots, interleaved throughout the course of events. In the main plot, Ryan Cawdor and J.B. Dix set off for Seattle in an armawag, leaving their friends behind at Jak Lauren's farm. Ryan and J.B. intend to meet up with Abe, a friend and formerly employed by their once-leader, Trader. The two had long believed Trader was dead after disappearing into the Colorado mountains, but Abe has since sent word that the Trader is alive. More importantly, Abe's note says that he and the Trader will be waiting to meet Ryan and J.B. near the ruins of Seattle, but only for the next six weeks. Scant hours into their trip, Ryan and J.B. are stopped by a group of \\"fladgies\\": religious extremists who practise self-flagellation. The group's leader doesn't just ask for food and supplies, he demands them, earning a denial at gunpoint from the two friends. Ryan and J.B. travel onward, not bothering to kill the group. Some days later J. B. and Ryan link up with a traveling animal show, run by a woman named Ellie Kissoon and her three daughters. The group heads to Weatherill Springs, and that evening put on a show outside the local bar for the ville's occupants. During the show an audience member extinguishes his cigar on one of the group's lions in a show of bravado, causing the animal to attack and starting a panicked firefight. In the aftermath several audience members are dead and Ryan is asked by Ellie to put down the mortally wounded lion, which he does. The group leaves town quickly, chased by gunfire from angry residents, and escape unharmed. Afterward Ryan notes that the bar's lockbox was missing following the incident, and after some hinting one of Ellie's daughters outright admits that they stole it during the confusion. This earns bemused approval from both Ryan and J. B., but the two nonetheless decide to part ways with the group, not the least reason being that Ellie and her daughters have expressed romantic interest in the two over objections that they are both in committed relationships.

This position can also be referred to as steward (the usual term on British ships), galley utilityman, messman, supply , waiter or General Steward (GS). The role of the steward's assistant consists mainly of stocking, cleaning and assisting with the preparation and serving of meals. The steward's assistant often assists the steward by removing stocks such as food, linen, and utensils and making sure they arrive where they're needed. Closely involved with the storeroom operations, the steward's assistant will assist in taking inventory. The steward's assistant also is typically in charge of the ship's linens, not only sorting, counting, and stocking but also issuing them to the crew. The steward's assistant is a foodhandler, and perhaps most visible while assisting the chief cook with the serving of meals. Depending on the ship, this can include taking orders and delivering the food to the tables in the ship's messroom and officer's saloon. The steward's assistant also customarily sets out the \\"night lunches\\" for watchstanders preparing to start late night watches, as well as setting and clearing tables. A ship's galley, pantry, and eating areas are notoriously hard to keep clean and sanitary, and this activity keeps the steward's assistant busy for much of his time. The steward's assistant must clean the ship's mess and officer's saloon, and the gear in both. This includes keeping the decks clean by sweeping and scrubbing. The steward's assistant disposes of trash and keeps garbage cans clean.

A thermosome is a group II chaperonin protein complex that functions in archaea. This group II chaperonin is an ATP-dependent chaperonin that is responsible for folding or refolding of incipient or denatured proteins. A thermosome has two rings, each consisting of eight subunits, stacked together to form a cylindrical shape with a large cavity at the center. The thermosome is also defined by its heterooligomeric nature. The complex consists of two subunits, alpha and beta, that alternate location within its two rings. Being a Group II chaperonin, the thermosome has a similar structure to group I chaperonins. The main difference, however, lies in the existence of a helical protrusion in the thermosome which composes of a built-in lid of the hydrophilic cavity. Not only is thermosome ATP-dependent, but the mechanism in which thermosome shifts from open to close conformation is also temperature-dependent. The open conformation of the ATP-thermosome exists mainly at low temperatures. Whereas, the closed conformation of the thermosome occurs when heating to physiological temperature.

A painting of Wilton Castle by E. Dayes, dated at 1797 Wilton Castle is a 12th-century Norman castle located in south-eastern Herefordshire, England on the River Wye adjacent to the town of Ross-on-Wye. The castle is named after the manor associated with it. This castle in Herefordshire, still standing mostly to battlement height, remains a monument to its former lords. The Longchamps of Wilton in their time provided Bailiffs of Normandy, Chancellors of England, sheriffs of Hereford and the Welsh Marches and enemies of King John. They were succeeded by the families of De Cantilupe (see Thomas de Cantilupe and links) and De Grey who between them built up a powerbase in Wales and the Marches. Matilda de Grey, n√©e de Cantilupe, stood up in court in 1292 and lied through her teeth to King Edward I of England that the castle had been built by her Longchamp ancestors in the days of Edward the Confessor (1042‚Äì66). In fact, the castle could not have been built before 1154 and certainly the 'barony' never held the Marcher Lord rights Lady Matilda claimed for it. The castle was primarily associated with a branch of the Norman- descended family of Grey, the Barons Grey of Wilton, a prominent dynasty of Norman Marcher Lords in the Welsh Marches, who held it from 1308 or before. The castle passed from the family when William Grey was captured by the French at the end of the defence of Gu√Ænes in 1557, and was forced to sell the castle to raise funds for his ransom. The castle was finally destroyed in the English Civil War, a period that saw skirmishes and sieges locally at Goodrich Castle, Ruardyn Castle and Raglan Castle.

Sophie Fr√©miet (16 June 1797 ‚Äì 4 December 1867) was a French painter. Born in Dijon, her father was the assistant curator of the city's museum, a patron of artists and a fervent Bonapartist. Sophie was taught by Anatole Devosge, a former pupil of Jacques- Louis David. Her father supported the work of a young Dijon sculptor, Fran√ßois Rude. In the aftermath of the second Bourbon Restoration in 1815, the Fr√©miet family, along with many other Bonapartists, left France for Brussels (now Belgium, then part of the newly created United Kingdom of the Netherlands). Here Sophie studied under another French exile, her former teacher's master, Jacques-Louis David. She worked as David's copyist and exhibited her own works in Brussels and in Antwerp. In 1820, her Belle Anthia was a great success at an exhibition in Ghent On 25 July 1821, Sophie married her father's former prot√©g√© Fran√ßois Rude. The couple would have only one child, Am√©d√©e, who died young in 1830. In Brussels Sophie was a successful artist, receiving many commissions, including several for the former royal palace at Tervuren, lost in the fire that destroyed it. Her works were neoclassicist in style, largely mythological, although she produced a small number of religious paintings. In 1826, the Rude family returned to France, settling in Paris. Here Sophie began to paint historical scenes. She served as the model for the female figure representing the Genius of War her husband's frieze The Departure of the Volunteers (also known as La Marseillaise), which forms part of the Arc de Triomphe. Fran√ßois Rude died in 1855, and Sophie devoted the rest of her life to exhibiting and publicising her husband's work. She died in Paris. References Geiger, Monique, \\"Fr√©miet, Sophie\\" in E.

After missionaries were expelled from China in the 1950s, it would continue to exist primarily in the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China.  History  The Church of Christ in China held its first general assembly in Shanghai in October 1927 with Cheng Jingyi as its first moderator, serving two terms (1927‚Äì1930 and 1930‚Äì1933). It was initially known as the Presbyterian Church of China () since it brought together a number of Presbyterian and Reformed churches. However, it was renamed after it invited other church bodies in China to join the union. At the first general assembly in 1927, the following groups joined the union: * American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions * Baptist Missionary Society * Church of Scotland * London Missionary Society * Presbyterian Church in Korea * Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (North) * Presbyterian Church in the United States (South) * Presbyterian Church of England * Presbyterian Church of Ireland * Presbyterian Church of New Zealand * Reformed Church in America * Reformed Church in the United States * South Fujian Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church * United Brethren in Christ * United Church of Canada. The fourth general assembly was held in Qingdao in 1937, with a total of 16 synods, 85 associations, 2842 local churches, 454 ordained ministers and approximately 130,000 communicants. The next one was never materialized due to the outbreak of World War II. After the Communist Party of China took over mainland China, the Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China was reorganized in 1953, and is the only subdivision of the Church of Christ in China that is still running.  Ecumenical Relations  The establishment of the Church of Christ in China was seen as an extension of the modern ecumenical movement, related to the 1910 World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh. But it also wrestled with different understandings of ecumenism and ecclesiology, which would have lasting effects on questions of church unity in mainland China until the present day. Today, what remains of the Church of Christ in China in its Hong Kong Council is a member of Christian Conference of Asia (CCA).

From 1952 through the spring of 1954, Fender produced approximately 660 model 5B6 Bassman amplifiers (serial numbers #0001‚Äì0660). The earlier cabinets have been called \\"TV Front\\" designs, with a front panel that had a rectangular grill cloth with rounded corners and looked much like a television of that era. In 1953 the cabinet designs were changed to the so-called \\"Wide Panel\\" design, with a 5 inch wide tweed covered panel above and below a wider swath of grill cloth. Fender ceased production of 5B6 Bassman amplifiers during the spring of 1954. =The 5D6 Bassman with dual rectifiers= During November 1954, Fender introduced the newly designed 5D6 Bassman amplifier offering four ten inch speakers and was designed utilizing two rectifier tubes. The 5D6 was a major departure from the earlier 5B6 Fender Bassman model. Designed by Freddie Tavares, longtime R&D; man at Fender, the new circuit included two rectifier tubes and became known as the Dual Rectifier Bassman.http://www.gbase.com/gear/fender- bassman-1956-tweedhttp://www.audioasylum.com/cgi/t.mpl?f=tubediy&m;=203358 Instead of the single 15\\" speaker, four 10\\" Jensen Alnico P10R speakers were used. The circuit had two innovations: a fixed bias for the power tubes, which increased power in comparison to the earlier cathode bias design, and a cathodyne phase inverter, using half of the 12AX7 tube and allowing a third gain stage on the other half. The first 4x10 Bassman amplifiers started with a batch of prototypes in November and December 1954, model 5D6. No schematic for the 5D6 circuit has ever been found, but Ken Fox and Frank Roy have created a few from originals, and copies are freely available online. Only 11 of these early 5D6 Bassman examples are known to have survived. The lowest serial number known to still exist is 0013 (Frank Roy), 0035 (Albert Talley), 0075 (Jim Cornett), 0077 (Perry Tate), 0089 (Mark Grandfield), 0701, 0745 (Walter Horton), 0769 (Hayes Kolb), 0780 (sold on eBay Nov 2006), 0783, and 0785 (Hayes Kolb) are among those still known to exist. =Narrow panel models, 1954 to 1960= Fender began making other models with tweed covering, a similar open backed cabinet with a rectangular grill cloth and a narrow (just over an inch wide) tweed covered panel at the top and bottom. Produced from 1954 until 1960, these models are called the \\"narrow panel\\" tweed amps . Fender introduced the model 5D6 \\"DK\\" in November 1954 followed by the 5E6 Bassman Amp during early 1955. The 5E6-A Bassman model was introduced later that year and included some evolutionary improvements. Demand for the tweed Bassman amp grew, so Fender increased production. By the middle of 1957 more than 1,500 examples of the 5E6 series had been sold. In July 1957, Fender introduced the model 5F6 Bassman. This model also had four Jensen P10R speakers, but the power supply was redesigned around a single 83 mercury vapor rectifier tube, and a new preamp circuit was introduced that included a three knob tone stack, with separate controls for Treble, Mid and Bass. The power amp included a \\"long tailed pair\\" phase inverter, an innovation that noticeably increased the \\"headroom\\" or clean power output capability of the amplifier. Similar preamp changes were also incorporated in the 5F8 Twin Amp at about the same time, but not on other large size Fender amps. During 1958, Fender introduced the model 5F6-A Bassman model. This final 1950s Tweed Bassman model product line included a change from the 83 mercury vapor rectifier tube to the GZ34 rectifier tube, as well as a modification within the Presence control circuit.http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-narrow- panel-tweed-bassman/ During early 1960, Fender began producing the 5F6-A Bassman with Jensen P10Q speakers. The P10Q Jensen speakers are more able to manage stronger electrical input power and generate better \\"clean\\" output sounds than previous installed P10R Jensen speakers. The P10R Jensen speakers were shipped within all Fender Bassmen from late 1954 until early 1960. Many professional music industry analysts have heralded the 1950s Fender 4√ó10 Bassman amps as the greatest guitar amp ever. The first 1954 Fender Tweed 5D6 4√ó10 circuit generated further Tweed Bassman amplifier development through 1960. Several Bassman models were progressively influenced by the 5D6 through the last Fender Tweed 5F6-A Bassman's circuit design. The 5F6-A Bassman's design was directly copied by Marshall Amplifiers within their JTM-45 amplifier during the early 1960s. In 1990, Fender began reissuing the 5F6-A Bassman. The first series of the reissue were made at the Corona, California facility, and came equipped with four Eminence-made 10\\" blue frame AlNiCo speakers, and a solid state rectifier unit. Later on, production was moved to Ensenada, Baja California, and the model name was altered to \\"59 Bassman LTD\\". The LTD came equipped with the original 5AR4 rectifier tube, and four Jensen P10R reissue alnico speakers, which was period correct for the original amp. =Piggyback model= In late 1960, Fender introduced a completely redesigned model 6G6 Bassman Amp, using the \\"piggy-back\\" design, in which the amplifier chassis is housed in a small cabinet, attached by metal clips to a larger separate speaker enclosure. The early models were called \\"Brownface\\" because of the dark brown color used on the control panel. The 6G6 model was covered in rough Blonde colored Tolex material with Oxblood colored grill cloth. It had a single GZ34 rectifier, two 5881/6L6GC power tubes and four 12AX7 preamp tubes. The output was 50 watts at 8 ohm into a single 12 inch speaker, with a \\"Tone Ring\\" baffle in the speaker cabinet. In early 1961, model 6G6-A was introduced with a solid state rectifier replacing the GZ34, and two 12 inch speakers with a conventional baffle in a slightly larger cabinet (wired in parallel) with a 4 ohm output. In 1962, model 6G6-B was introduced, which incorporated circuit changes but used the same speaker configuration. In 1963 smooth Blonde Tolex covering was used instead of the early rough texture cover, and a light tan grill cloth. In late, 1963, Fender changed the cosmetics to what is commonly known as the \\"blackface\\" scheme. This amp still had the presence knob and same circuit (designated 6G6-B) as the smooth Blonde Tolex Bassman, but the faceplace was now black, the Tolex was black, and the grillcloth had moved to a silver cloth with black thread. The logo had also transitioned from the flat cast tin Fender with the brown paint in the tail, to a plastic logo with faux chrome and more 3-D shape. In 1964 Fender introduced the AA864 circuit, and changed the appearance to the \\"Blackface\\" design, with black tolex covering and a black painted control panel. Fender was sold to CBS in 1965, and the AA165 circuit was briefly introduced, before being replaced by the AB165 circuit. The \\"Blackface\\" design continued until the \\"Silverface\\" model was introduced in mid 1967https://wgsusa.com/node/2738. Early \\"Drip-Edge\\" Silverface Bassmans made in mid 1967 used the same AB165 circuitry as the previous Blackface versions. The Brownface, Blackface, and Silverface \\"piggyback head\\" (except the Bassman 10 and 20, which were also combo amplifiers) versions of the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s generally followed a trend toward cleaner sound and more headroom. =Solid state Fender Bassman= In 2000, Fender introduced a range of solid-state Fender Bassman combos, the Bassman 25, 60, and 200.Fender. \\"Fender¬Æ Bass Amplifiers and Speaker Enclosure Owner's Manuals (Archive)\\", Fender Website. Retrieved on 31 July 2019. These were joined by the Bassman 100 combo and the tube powered Bassman 300 head in 2002. In 2005 all the solid state combos were replaced with much smaller and lighter, and more powerful models, the Bassman 100, 150, and 250. The Bassman 250 was available with two speaker combinations or as a head only. These solid state Bassman amps were discontinued in 2010, however the tube Bassman 300 continued on until 2013. =Hybrid Bassman TV= In 2009, Fender introduced the hybrid Fender Bassman TV series with a tube pre-amp and solid state power amp.Fender. \\"Fender Bassman TV Panel Manual\\".

Its rated power output was increased to 20 watts, its output tubes were a pair of 6BQ5/EL84 (the only Fender amp of that time to feature them) and they were operated at voltages in excess of their rated maximums and under fixed bias, but was soon changed to 35 watts and a pair of 6L6GC power tubes with a GZ34 rectifier (circuits 6G9-A and 6G9-B.)http://www.thetubestore.com/Resources/Guitar-Amp-Info/Early-Fender- Tweed-Amps#tweed Tremolux (5E9-A and 5G9 models) There were 10\\", 12\\" and 2√ó10\\" speaker cabinet configurations (the 2√ó10\\" being the majority of amps produced). In 1963, the grillcloth changed to gold colored. In 1964, the cream tolex was replaced with black tolex with silver grillecloth, and the circuit was changed to AB763, which used an optoisolator to couple the tremolo effect, replacing the earlier direct bias-modulation circuits. In 1963 and 1964, the Tremolux shared the same circuit as the Fender Vibrolux,http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender- Vibrolux-5E11-Schematic.pdf with the Vibrolux being a 1x12 combo as opposed to a piggyback configuration.

It was first introduced in 1963 by incorporating an onboard spring reverb tank to the newly redesigned Fender Deluxe amplifier. Specifications The Deluxe Reverb is a 22-watt tube amplifier (at 8 ohms), powered by a pair (\\"duet\\") of 7408/6V6GT power tubes, one GZ34/5AR4 rectifier tube, four 7025/12AX7 tubes for preamplification and tremolo oscillation, and two 6201/12AT7 tubes driving the reverb and phase inverter circuits. Throughout its production, the amplifier has most often featured a Jensen C-12Q series 12-inch loudspeaker, although Oxford 12K5, Marlboro SE, Utah and Eminence speakers have also been used. The 22-watt output was obtained by operating the 6V6 power tubes well in excess of their maximum specified operating voltage. The amplifier weighs 42 pounds and measures 9.5\\" x 24.5\\" x 17.5\\". Variations The original Deluxe Reverb (circuits AA763, and later AB763) was introduced during the \\"blackface\\" era of Fender amplifiers with a black control panel and white lettering. In 1967, two years after Fender was purchased by CBS, Fender began issuing amps with a silver metallic control face and light blue lettering. This gave birth to the \\"silverface\\" era, and the Deluxe Reverb followed suit in 1968. The circuit design remained largely unchanged through the ensuing years, and the control face was changed back to a blackface in 1980. The Deluxe Reverb was discontinued in 1982. The Deluxe Reverb II was introduced that same year. Output on the amp was diminished to 20 watts and a solid-state rectifier was used. The tremolo circuit was removed. Gain, master volume, and presence controls were added. And the two channels were made switchable as opposed to the individual inputs on the Deluxe Reverb. The Deluxe Reverb II was effectively a completely different amplifier, and it was discontinued in 1986. This was the so-called \\"Rivera-era\\". In 1993, Fender released the '65 Deluxe Reverb reissue. It possessed the original cosmetics and circuitry, but was wired on a printed circuit board rather than hand-wired. The reissue is still currently in production. In the summer of 2013, Fender produced a limited run of the Deluxe Reverb reissue in the form of an amplifier head. This had never been done in the past, as Fender had only built the Deluxe and its derivatives as combo amps (that is to say an amp with the speaker built in). The limited run only saw a very small number produced, however, it was announced in early 2014 that Fender was adding the Deluxe Reverb Head to its permanent lineup of Vintage Reissue series amplifiers. Also in 2013, Fender introduced a redressed version of the reissue with silverface cosmetics and slightly altered circuitry, dubbed the '68 Custom Deluxe Reverb.

Most residents of Canoe work in Salmon Arm, which is only a 7-minute drive out of the community, though some businesses operate in Canoe including Canoe Plumbing, several hairdressers, a violin school and other home-based businesses. Canoe Forest Products Ltd. operates a plywood plant and is the largest employer in the community. The Salmon Arm water treatment facility is located beside Canoe Beach in a new high tech facility. Attractions Canoe's attractions are mainly oriented around summertime tourism, and include a 27-hole executive golf course and restaurant, go-carts and mini-golf, two motels, coffee bistro and roaster, marina, wharf, two boat launches, parks and trails, and a free public beach. The 1919 Victory Hall was recently renovated to host local events and concerts. Canoe Beach is the only public beach in the immediate Salmon Arm area and draws significant local tourist traffic in summer months. The beach and adjacent park areas host important events for the wider Salmon Arm community, such as seasonal ball tournaments, the CP Holiday Train, and the 150th Canada Day celebration.

The Viceroy was built to order for Captain T. Neville Stack and Sydney Lewis Turner, to compete in the England-Australia MacRobertson Air Race. Only one aircraft, registered G-ACMU, was built. Design and development The Viceroy was a modified Airspeed Envoy. Modifications included: *More powerful, supercharged Armstrong-Siddeley Cheetah VI engines in long chord, smooth NACA cowlings *Strengthened main landing gear to allow higher weight takeoff *An auxiliary petrol tank, capacity was 270 Imp gallon/1,227 litres installed in the aft fuselage *Narrowed fuselage without passenger windows Operational history The Airspeed Viceroy started the race from RAF Mildenhall, England, but after several reliability problems including with the mainwheel brakes, it was withdrawn from the race at Athens. The pilots concluded that it would be unsafe to proceed and they would probably be unable to finish the race. An acrimonious set of legal actions followed, with the pilots complaining that the aircraft, beset by multiple problems, had been \\"not really ready\\". Airspeed contested the action, and eventually the aircraft was returned to them without refund. The aircraft returned to Portsmouth and was then stored until July 1936 when it was sold the following month by the French concern, SFTA and departed to France en route to the Spanish Civil War. Documentation regarding the Viceroy's service with the Spanish Republican Air Force is sketchy. The intention was to convert the aircraft into a bomber and photographs suggest that it did receive new markings and was stationed at an airbase, but further information is not available as to its actual service.Airspeed AS.6 Envoy/AS-8 Viceroy (1) Operators AS.8 Viceroy in Spanish Republican Air Force colour scheme ; *Spanish Republican Air Force Specifications See also References * The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft (Part Work 1982-1985).

It was originally a farming hamlet, but since the first lifts were built in the 1970s, it has evolved into a dedicated holiday resort. It now has few permanent residents, with most seasonal workers preferring to live in other nearby settlements, such as Longefoy. It remains an attractive village, with an old chapel at its centre. It now caters for visitors during the winter ski season - usually from Christmas to early April, and in July and August. In the summer the main lift operates from Monday to Friday to cater for hikers and mountain bikers. For the 2016/17 winter season, a one-week lift pass covering the entire La Plagne domain will cost 260 Euros. A one-week summer pass in 2016 cost 25 Euros. Local shops provide ski and board hire in Winter, while mountain bikes and climbing gear can be rented in Summer. Montalbert links to the rest of the La Plagne ski domain via two ski lifts. The first of these is a rapid cable car/bubble, which was installed in the summer of 2015. From the 2016/17 season a new chairlift (Les Envers) will provide a rapid link to Aime 2000, part of the main La Plagne ski area. The slopes above Montalbert are North-facing and therefore retain their snow-cover well. The area also has an extensive snow cannon network. Montalbert markets itself primarily at families and it caters for an international clientele. The ski school is run by ESF ( Ecole de Ski Francais) and they offer lessons from the age of 3 years and up. Accommodation is mainly self-catering apartments and chalets, although there are also catered chalets as well. Several of the developments are relatively new, but have been built in a 'Savoyarde' chalet style in an effort to blend in with their surroundings. There are numerous restaurants in the village, most of them serving variations of local Savoyarde cuisine (e.g. raclette, fondue, tartiflette), as well as a couple of pizza outlets. There is a small supermarket which sells fresh bread and a wide variety of produce during the holiday seasons, although its prices are rather high. Nightlife is limited when compared to bigger resorts, though there are several bars which are open into the early hours. Montalbert is about 200 km from Lyon Airport, 240 km from Geneva, 100 km from Chamb√©ry Airport and 160 km from Grenoble Airport. High speed trains connecting the UK and Europe also stop at Aime-La-Plagne which is about 10 km away External links *Webcam * http://www.mountainheaven.co.uk * http://www.ski-montalbert.co.uk * http://www.montalbert.info Category:Ski areas and resorts in France Category:Tourist attractions in Savoie ","title":"Montalbert"},{"id":"9860913","text":"\\"I Love You Mi Vida\\" (, \\"I Love You My Darling\\") is a song recorded by Spanish boy band D'Nash.

He attended a New South Wales interdenominational theological college and in 1917 joined the United Aborigines' Mission. From Walgett, where he built a bag church and a wooden hut for himself, he ministered to Aboriginal communities, travelling long distances by motor cycle, addressing meetings and making converts. In 1920 he spent four months in Melbourne preparing for a new mission on the Western Australian goldfields near Laverton (). Choosing the old Mount Margaret goldfield, he leased its common and began to erect huts and raise goats to finance provision of rations. Soon groups of Aborigines came to 'sit down' at the mission and helped to build fences, shepherd goats and pull sandalwood. His success in attracting Aborigines and his policy of paying them modest wages antagonized local pastoralists who tried to sabotage the mission and have it moved into the desert (). In Melbourne on 14 October 1922 Schenk married Isobel May Johnston, a typist; at Mount Margaret she taught crafts to the women. The products helped to finance the mission, as did the publication of Schenk's 'prayer letters' by the U.A.M. and concerts given by the Mount Margaret Minstrels. School classes began in 1926, and from 1932 Mrs. Mary Bennett taught there. It was in basic literacy and numeracy, craft and vocational training that the mission made its greatest impact. Mount Margaret had been secure from 1927 when police began to entrust Aborigines of part- descent who were state wards to Schenk's care rather than to the Moore River government settlement north of Perth. This was approved by the chief protector of Aborigines A. O. Neville, who strengthened Schenk's hand by making the mission a central rationing station. Thirty children were accommodated in the first Graham Home by 1930; parents were encouraged to settle at the mission ‚Äî unlike the dormitory-based r√©gimes of other Aboriginal institutions. The mission used a \\"no work, no rations\\" formula. Earning opportunities expanded with the installation of a small ore-crushing battery, and low-grade alluvial ore was exploited by Aboriginal miners. Others learned carpentry, shearing and station work (). Schenk originally purchased miners' huts and building material which he reassembled at Mount Margaret; the Depression allowed him to buy more buildings. Water was a problem but medical facilities were provided by Mrs. Bennett's gift of the Christisson Memorial Hospital in 1936. By 1933 the European staff at Mount Margaret numbered ten, there were forty-one students at the school and the mission had the appearance of a regular township. Difficulties surfaced when Aboriginal elders resisted Schenk's \\"unsympathetic and fundamentalist interference\\" with traditional practices. He opposed infanticide, the ritual drinking of blood, the use of sacred boards (which he thought were deified), and in-law avoidance laws which undermined his mass meetings. While not conversant with the local languages, he advised his subordinates to learn them and his daughters Margaret, Esther and Elizabeth became fluent. Mount Margaret was visited in 1930 by A. P. Elkin and Phyllis Kaberry who hoped to conduct field-work there. Elkin later criticized Schenk's attitude to traditional Aboriginal beliefs; in turn the missionary accused the anthropologists of fostering \\"works of darkness\\" and \\"the resurgence of the devil\\". However, J. B. Birdsell and Norman Tindale, who came in 1939, thought Mount Margaret \\"the best solution to the pressing half-caste problem\\". Supporting the mission's assimilationist approach, Tindale predicted that it would become less relevant to Aborigines as they entered white society. Nevertheless, Schenk bitterly opposed the 'merge' and 'absorb' policy for Aborigines of mixed descent which Neville advocated; he resented the chief protector's complaint that the growing Mount Margaret population was undermining assimilation. After World War II outside employment attracted many older residents but they were replaced by tribal people from the Central Reserve. Schenk had contributed to setting up another U.A.M. settlement at Warburton Range in 1933. In 1954 Schenk retired to Esperance where he died on 7 August 1969, aged 80, survived by his wife, three daughters and son. External links *Biography References * R. H. W.

History =KTKT-FM and KFMM= The first FM station to sign on in Tucson was 99.5 KTKT-FM, in March 1954.Broadcasting Yearbook 1955 page 77 Thomas J. Wallace, owned the station, along with AM 1490 KTKT (now at AM 990). KTKT-FM mostly simulcast the AM station's programming. In 1958, KTKT-FM was slated to move to Mount Bigelow, the tallest peak near Tucson. That move did not materialize, but it did result in a call sign change to KFMM (FM on the Mountain). Those call letters were used for 21 years. KTKT-FM/KFMM was sold several times in its early years: to Copper State Broadcasting Corporation in 1957 and to Lee Little in 1960. During this time, the station was powered at 30,000 watts, a third of its current power. And the tower was only 73 feet tall, keeping the station's signal only within Tucson and its close-in suburbs. =Religious KNDE= In 1965, KFMM was bought by the Tucson Broadcasting Company, which also owned AM 1400 KTUC.Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-10 KFMM aired a Christian radio format. In 1979, a new company calling itself KTUC, Incorporated, acquired KTUC and KFMM. It switched the FM station's call letters to KNDE, while still keeping its religious format. =Country KIIM= In 1983, KNDE changed its call letters again, this time to KIIM, switching to a country music format, and becoming the only country outlet on FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1985 page B-15 There was one other country station, co-owned AM 1290 KCUB, which specialized in a more personality and information country format. Rex Broadcasting received a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission to boost power to 100,000 watts, coupled with a sizable increase in antenna height. KIIM proved so successful, Rex Broadcasting decided to switch its AM station to the same call letters. AM 1290 became KIIM, while FM 99.5 became KIIM-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-21 Several years later, KIIM switched back to the KCUB call sign, as a classic country outlet. In 2001, Citadel Broadcasting purchased both KIIM-FM and KCUB, switching the AM station to a sports radio format, but keeping the highly rated KIIM-FM as a country outlet.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2002-2003 page D-25 Citadel was acquired by current owner, Cumulus Media, in 2011.

He was a contemporary of important Rockport artists Aldro Hibbard, Emil Gruppe, W. Lester Stevens, Antonio Cirino, and Marguerite Pierson. Born in Rotterdam on 20 February 1888, Thieme studied at the Academie of Fine Arts in Rotterdam for two years and then, briefly, at the Royal Academy, the Hague. He traveled widely in Europe, frequently finding work as a stage designer. Thieme traveled to the United States at the age of 22. He quickly found work as a stage designer at the Century Theater in New York, designing sets for the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. When the commission ended, he traveled to South America, primarily Brazil and Argentina. Stage work again provided his livelihood. A return to Europe followed with further work in England, France, and Italy. Returning to the United States with a contract for additional stage work, Thieme found himself in Boston. He discontinued work on the stage in 1928 and from then on made his living with the sales of his paintings and etchings. Thieme married Lillian Beckett in 1929 and moved to Rockport, MA. He established the Thieme School of Art. He exhibited his work frequently at the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York. He continued to travel widely; Mexico, Guatemala, Florida, and France were major destinations, always painting en plein air. Thieme committed suicide on 6 December 1954 in Greenwich, CT. The circumstances of his death are not fully understood. There have been stories of deep depression or major illness, but no definitive rationale for his suicide has emerged.

He was originally best known for his short stories and novels which mix elements of sword and sorcery with historical fantasy and Slavic mythology, but later achieved mainstream success with a series of novels in the historical mystery genre, featuring a pair of fictional late 16th/ early 17th century detectives, Joachim Stein and Matej Barbariƒç. He has published (under the pseudonym Thorleif Larssen) several novels featuring Robert E. Howard's classic character Conan the Barbarian, as well as (under his own name) the Warlock'Warlock' is one of the possible translations of the Slovak term 'ƒåernok≈àa≈æn√≠k' trilogy, a set of historical fantasy novels following the adventures of the Slavic warlock Rogan in the historical setting of the 8th century Principality of Nitra and neighboring lands. ƒåerven√°k's short stories range from themes similar to those used in his novels to westerns and horrors and can be found in various (mostly Czech) anthologies, Slovak science fiction/fantasy magazine Fant√°zia and Czech magazines Ikarie and Pevnost. Most of ƒåerven√°k's early books were published in Czech translation prior to publication of their original Slovak versions; this changed in 2010, when the first of his historical novels was picked up by a major Slovak publisher. Biography Juraj ƒåerven√°k was born on June 16, 1974 in ≈Ωiar nad Hronom, Slovakia, but spent most of his life in the town of Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica. After graduating from secondary school he went through a series of odd jobs, finally settling in a position at the town's cultural center, where his duties included managing the local cinema. He ultimately made writing (as a novelist, short story writer and film critic for various magazines) his full-time career in 2005. Writing career ƒåerven√°k's early works, published under the pseudonym 'Thorleif Larssen', were moderately successful with readers but largely dismissed by critics as derivative of his literary influences (most notably Howard) and lacking in inventiveness and sophistication. After Tollrander, ƒåerven√°k went on a nearly four-year writing and publishing hiatus, from which he emerged in 1998 with a short story called \\"M≈ïtvi striebro nepotrebuj√∫\\" (Dead Men Need No Silver), published in the Fant√°zia magazine. The short story introduced a new protagonist, Rogan the Warlock, along with his wolf-demon companion, Goryvlad, in an original world of high fantasy based on Slavic history and mythology. The readers' response was favorable and more short stories followed. \\"Krvav√Ω ohe≈à, biely ohe≈à\\" (Blood Fire, White Fire), published a year later, received the O najlep≈°iu fantasy (Best Fantasy) Award. ƒåerven√°k returned to writing novels with 2000's Conan nel√≠tostn√Ω (Conan The Relentless) (writing as Thorleif Larssen once again) and collected two more prestigious awards, Istron for \\"Z posv√°tn√© vody zrozen√°\\" (Born Of The Sacred Water) in 2002 and Raketa for \\"Hrdlorez\\" (Cutthroat) in 2003. 2003 saw the publication of the first in the Warlock series of novels, ƒåernoknƒõ≈æn√≠k ‚Äì Vl√°dce vlk≈Ø (Warlock ‚Äì The Master of Wolves). It was the first book to be published under ƒåerven√°k's own name and marked his embrace of historical fantasy, as it brought Rogan into the historical setting of Central Europe at the turn of the 8th century. The novel earned positive reviews and was followed by two sequels (2004, 2005) and a short story collection (2006). ƒåerven√°k then moved on to a historical fantasy trilogy based on Bylinas; the first novel, Bohatier: Oceƒæov√© ≈æezlo (Bogatyr: The Iron Scepter), describing the exploits of the legendary hero Ilya Muromets was published in 2007, followed by two sequels in 2007 and 2008. In 2009, ƒåerven√°k wrote Str√°≈æcovia Varad√≠na (The Guardians of Oradea), the first in a series of historical adventure novels following the exploits of the fictional captain Korn√©lius B√°thory in the late 17th century, against the backdrop of the various conflicts between the Ottoman empire and the Habsburgs. The novel was picked up by one of Slovakia's major publishers, Slovart, marking the beginning of ƒåerven√°k's crossover success with mainstream readers. This trend was further cemented by a series of historical mystery novels, featuring a pair of fictional detectives, Joachim Stein and Matej Barbariƒç, on a quest to solve crimes in the late 16th/early 17th century Habsburg Empire under special orders from Archduke Matthias of Austria. In contrast to ƒåerven√°k's previous work, the bestselling series features next to no fantasy elements, and, apart from inserting a few fictional characters, stays true to actual historical events.

Since the Kingdom of Majorca did not have courts, the Gran i General Consell took over most of the functions they would otherwise have had, including the role of a representative body. The Gran i General Consell evolved from the Catalan municipal councils, especially that of the City of Majorca (present-day Palma de Mallorca. The body that was to become the Gran i General Consell was founded in 1249, and the Consell was abolished on 22 July 1718 by Philip V, empowered by the Nova Planta Decree of Majorca and Ibiza (28 November 1715). At the same time, all other separate Majorcan institutions were dissolved. Three important characteristics of the Gran i General Consell were: * Unlike, for example, the French Estates-General, the three estates represented in the Gran i General Consell were given equal representation. * The principle that the amount of participation granted to representatives in the Gran i General Consell should be in line with their contributions to society. * The democratic principle of decision-making based on the wishes of the majority. Differences between the Consell and the Spanish Cortes Unlike the Spanish Cortes of the time, the Consell could not be summoned by the king but was subject to the jurisdiction of the judges. Similarities between the Consell and the Cortes Both the Consell and the Cortes were collegiate organs, the Consell being composed of members divided into the same categories as the members of the Cortes (12 Knights, 12 Citizens, 8 merchants, 12 minstrels, 28 representatives from the towns). The Consell collaborated with the king in matters of legislation and administration, and had the power to oversee over the king in his relations with the Consell itself. Functions of the Consell The Consell was a debating chamber, and could convene on the orders of the judges and in the absence of the king and the viceroy. However, in the absence of the viceroy, the judges and the sindics, who were nominated specially for the purpose, the Consell could not act as an executive body. Decisions were taken by majority vote, and it could act in defence of the realm, or assist the king's officers. Powers * The Consell could draft laws, but afterwards (depending on their importance), these would have to be approved either by the king or by the viceroy. * Proposing laws to the king. * Amending laws and supervision of its own constitution. * Approval of the budget and passing of laws to allow for the collection of taxes and the expenditure of funds. * Defence, including organization of the militia; management of the military; procurement of material; construction of fortifications. * Health and welfare. * Official weights and measures. * Public works * Commerce * Culture, education and religion. Composition * The Plenary Council was composed of all members of the Consell (72 from 1614-1715). * The Lesser Council or Secret Council was an executive committee of the full Consell with delegated powers; it consisted of 30 councillors, of which at least 3 had to be representatives of the towns. * City or royal judges. The military judge or the chief judge presided over the Secret Council. Election *Beginning in 1447, the members were selected by Sac i sort.Coneix el consell , official site of the Consell de Mallorca. Accessed 26 April 2008.

She likens this feeling to vertigo, and wonders if perhaps \\"solo is the way to go\\", suggesting that she may choose to end the relationship rather than deal with the problems. Olivia Lewis performing \\"Vertigo\\" for Malta. Musically, the song features a tune described as \\"oriental\\" and containing elements both of Middle Eastern and Far Eastern music (most notably a gong, struck at various points during the song). Lewis herself performed in a costume made of silk and giving the appearance of being from China. As Malta had not finished the previous Contest in the top ten, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed twentieth (following Norway's Guri Schanke with \\"Ven a bailar conmigo\\" and preceding Andorra's Anonymous with \\"Salvem el m√≥n\\"). At the close of voting, it had received 15 points, placing 25th in a field of 28 and thus preventing Malta from qualifying for the final. The result represents Malta's first failure to appear in the final since the country relaunched itself at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1991.

She was the first female member of the California State Senate. Biography The daughter of an immigrant from Serbia, her family settled in the town of Cutler, California where her family began farming. A small packing house was built next to their home to pack and ship the family's crops. A type of white peach later named the \\"Rose Ann\\" were grown here. Born in Cutler in 1927, Rose Ann graduated from Orosi Union High School, now Orosi High School. Vuich later moved to the nearby town of Dinuba, California and became a tax accountant. She became a member of the Alta District Hospital Board and President of the Dinuba Chamber of Commerce. Not many initially took notice when she ran for a vacant state Senate seat in 1976, as the area voted Republican in most elections. However, she scored one of the biggest upsets in the state that year when she narrowly defeated Ernest Mobley, a 10 year Republican Assemblyman, in the general election. Vuich quickly became popular in her district for her unassuming manner and her political independence. She broke with her party on agricultural and law enforcement issues on several occasions. Her Democratic colleagues tolerated that because of the conservative constituency she represented. However, she was willing to stand up to conservatives, angering popular Republican Governor George Deukmejian in 1989 when she voted against confirming his chosen appointee for state Treasurer when the post became vacant. Vuich would ring a bell whenever her fellow Senators addressed the collective members of the Senate as \\"Gentlemen,\\" to remind them that the chamber was no longer exclusively male. Vuich retired from politics in 1992. One of her former staffers, Cal Dooley, became a United States Representative from 1991 until 2005, representing a large slice of the area Vuich represented in the state senate. The Rose Anne Vuich Ethical Leadership Award is presented annually by the Kenneth L. Maddy Institute at California State University, Fresno to a person who has demonstrated \\"integrity, strength of character, exemplary ethical behavior, ability to build consensus, serving the public interest and vision for enhancing the community.\\" Recipients of the Vuich Award include: Juan Arambula (2002) and Cal Dooley (2004).http://www.joincalifornia.com/candidate/5836 accessed 12-14-08 The interchange of State Route 41 and State Route 180 in Fresno, California is named the Rose Ann Vuich Interchange, and in 2006, Hearing Room 2040 at the California State Capitol was renamed the Rose Ann Vuich Hearing Room.

It liberates hydrogen cyanide easily, so it is used as a source of such. For this reason, this cyanohydrin is also highly toxic. Preparation In the laboratory, this compound may be prepared by treating sodium cyanide with acetone, followed by acidification: :400px Considering the high toxicity of acetone cyanohydrin, a lab scale production has been developed using microreactor technology. to avoid needing to manufacture and store large quantities of the reagent. Alternatively, a simplified procedure involves the action of sodium or potassium cyanide on the sodium bisulfite adduct of acetone prepared in situ. This gives a less pure product, one that is nonetheless suitable for most syntheses. Reactions It is used as a surrogate in place of HCN, as illustrated by this synthesis of lithium cyanide: :(CH3)2C(OH)CN + LiH ‚Üí (CH3)2CO + LiCN + H2 In transhydrocyanation, an equivalent of HCN is transferred from acetone cyanohydrin to another acceptor, with acetone as byproduct. The transfer is an equilibrium process, initiated by base. The reaction can be driven by trapping reactions or by the use of a superior HCN acceptor, such as an aldehyde. In the hydrocyanation reaction of butadiene, the transfer is irreversible. Acetone cyanohydrin is an intermediate en route to methyl methacrylate. Treated with sulfuric acid give the sulfate ester of the methacrylamide, methanolysis of which gives ammonium bisulfate and methyl methacrylate.. Natural occurrence Cassava tubers contain linamarin, a glucoside of acetohydrin, and the enzyme linamarinase for hydrolysing the glucoside. Crushing the tubers releases these compounds and produces acetone cyanohydrin. Safety Acetone cyanohydrin is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the US Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and carries an RCRA P069 waste code. The principal hazards of acetone cyanohydrin arise from its ready decomposition on contact with water, which releases highly toxic hydrogen cyanide.

Hopwood also served as a keyboardist, singer and guitarist for the post-Peter Noone outfit, Sour Mash, which recorded an unreleased album, A Whale of a Tale for RCA. Early life Born on 26 October 1946 at Park Hospital, Davyhulme area of Manchester, he attended Urmston Grammar School. Career A talented musician and composer, he continues to live and work in the music industry in the UK. Several rare demo recordings from his time in Herman's Hermits are available through his website. Peter Noone credits his old friend with coming up with the idea of recording \\"Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter\\" as an afterthought, when Herman's Hermits were short of material for their first album. Noone's heavily accented delivery, together with Hopwood's muted rhythm guitar work, propelled the track to number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Contrary to many reports, the song was not an old music hall number, and the Hermits did play on the track as well as on many other Herman's Hermits records, including all of the band's number-one US and UK hits. Ralph McTell recorded the theme tune to Cosgrove Hall Films's adaptation of The Wind in the Willows written by Hopwood and Malcolm Rowe, and this was released as a single in 1984, after the series was aired on ITV. Hopwood also co-wrote the music for Cosgrove Hall's adaptations of Terry Pratchett's Soul Music and \\"Wyrd Sisters\\" with Phil Bush. Soundtrack albums were released in 1997. Hopwood and Rowe co-wrote and produced the music to the 1989 film adaptation of Roald Dahl's The BFG. Other Cosgrove Hall shows he composed for were Creepy Crawlies, Alias the Jester with Malcolm Rowe, Foxbusters, Andy Pandy, Discworld, with Phil Bush, and Albie, alone. In 2004 he composed the music for the remake of Pingu for HIT Entertainment, and started work on Bob the Builder TV series and Specials, which was to last until production ceased in 2011. In 2013 he formed a music rights company, CHF Music, with Cosgrove Hall Fitzpatrick Entertainment, the newly launched company run by Brian Cosgrove and Simon Hall, to look after all the music content for their new shows. It was revealed in 2020 that Hopwood is working on his memoir with author Paul Stenning. Pluto Music In 1968, Keith Hopwood and Derek Leckenby founded Pluto Music, a company that composes musical scores for commercials, films, and animation. Leckenby died in 1994, but Hopwood continues operating the company. Pluto Studios has been very successful, providing services to many top acts including The Clash. Hopwood has proved himself a fine soundtrack composer, working mostly on animated television series including the hugely successful \\"Bob the Builder.\\" Always a composer, he wrote and co-wrote numerous songs recorded by Herman's Hermits, and other bands such as Brinsley Schwarz. Hopwood also published and promoted the singer-songwriter, Helen Watson. He has also helped create many tracks for his granddaughter, Izzy Hopwood, who has had great musical talent from a young age. Personal life On 21 January 1968 Keith Hopwood married Penny Pagni, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. They were married for 17 years and they had three children : Daxalen \\"Dax\\" (born on 5 July 1968), Joel (born in 1976) and Zhian (born in 1978). In 1989, Hopwood married Maria Verdellis.

Astor then undertook a solo career with the albums Submarine (1990) and Zoo (1991) on Creation. Finding success in France, Astor moved to the Danceteria label to release Paradise (1992, as Peter Astor and the Holy Road), and God and Other Stories in 1992. After becoming disillusioned with the music business, he disappeared from view for a number of years, returning in the late 1990s with his Ellis Island Sound and The Wisdom of Harry projects, both releasing music on 7\\", 12\\" and 10\\" for a variety of emerging independent labels such as Static Caravan Recordings, Wurlitzer Jukebox and Astor's own label, Faux Lux. The Wisdom of Harry eventually signed to Matador Records, while Ellis Island Sound, Astor's collaboration with David Sheppard, signed with Heavenly Recordings. In 2005, Astor released Hal's Eggs, a solo album including radical reworkings of folk standards on Static Caravan Recordings. At around the same time, Cherry Red released compilation albums featuring his work: The Weather Prophets' Blues Skies and Freerides (The Best Of, 1986‚Äì1989), Injury Time (Solo 89‚Äì93), a selection of solo work from his two Creation and Danceteria albums. The label re-issued The Loft's retrospective Once More Round the Fair. Astor continued to write and release with on the Peace Frog label. His solo album, Songbox followed in 2011, featuring an extra disc of cover versions of the albums' songs by Let's Wrestle, The Raincoats, Darren Hayman, Comet Gain, The Proper Ornaments, Mathew Sawyer, Dollboy and Piano Magic. He works as senior lecturer at the University of Westminster, where he teaches, researches and writes about music; in 2014, he published his study of Richard Hell and the Voidoids' Blank Generation, as part of Bloomsbury's 33‚Öì series. At the beginning of 2015, Astor signed to Fortuna Pop, and released the single \\"Mr Music\\", followed by an album, Spilt Milk, recorded with James Hoare of Veronica Falls. In 2020 he released \\"Attendant1: Music On/Opening Lines\\" under the name The Attendant, with \\"Music On\\" being a indie track which was recorded in a talk-sung style to evoke the work of Mark E.

It was the first TV movie made by MTV.https://variety.com/2005/tv/news/mtv- screens-aids-movie-1117933509/ It was filmed in St. Petersburg, Mexico City, Nairobi and Los Angeles and shows the lives of 4 people travelling across the globe. During their journeys they think and reason about issues of life such as emotionality and sexuality. Plot Transit is presented in a non-linear narrative and follows four main characters from around the world who meet in fortuitous circumstances. The film opens in Los Angeles sometime in 2004 where Asha, an Americanized Indian woman, returns from her trip to Nairobi, Kenya and is riding a taxi driving through the freeway. The scene fades to black and the story shifts back six months earlier in St. Petersburg, Russia. Tatjana, a secretary, is in an abusive relationship with Yuri, a cab driver who is a drug user. On impulse, she ends the relationship and proceeds to have sex with a Mexican businessman named, Ruben, whom she has flirted with in her boss's office to the chagrin of her close friend, Masha. Tatjana naively believes that Ruben is the man she wants to be with, and so she ends up flying to Mexico City to follow him. Upon tracking his residence, Tatjana is dismayed when a woman holding a baby in her arms states that she is Ruben's wife after saying that she is looking for Ruben. Tatjana goes to a public park to make a call on a payphone and scream her frustrations to Ruben on the phone. Emotionally tired and exhausted from the flight and carrying her large stroller bag around the city in the heat, Tatjana loses consciousness and faints on the spot. Nearby, a man has observed Tatjana whilst enjoying a picnic with his friends. A brief flashback of two months prior reveals the man to be Jose Luis, nicknamed Champignon (mushroom) or Champy for short, by his handsome yet womanizing friend, Blanco. Champy feels envy and resentment towards Blanco as he is unsuccessful in finding a girlfriend, whilst Blanco already has a relationship but finds time to enjoy infidelities with beautiful women, despite Blanco's good intentions to pair him with women during his secret trips with his mistresses in Acapulco. Champy, however, has landed a job with a brewery company, and the story returns to present time to the picnic with Champy, Blanco, and the rest of their friends to celebrate Champy's new job. When Champy sees Tatjana faint after her phone call, he immediately runs to her side with his friends chasing after him. The group crowds around the unknown girl, and one of Champy's female friends suggest that he take her to his apartment to recover. The story cuts to Los Angeles where Asha is shown with Vip, her fianc√© who is also an Americanized Indian, having lunch to celebrate an event. It is shown that Asha is a film student on her way to Kenya to shoot her graduation documentary film. Her parents are conservative and traditional Indian people, and they record a heartfelt video message to Asha's uncle and aunt, whom she will be residing with once she arrives in Nairobi. On the eve before her flight, Asha stumbles upon a sex tape of Vip with one of his female Caucasian colleagues she found while preparing to follow Vip to a nightclub where he his partying with his friends. Hurt by this betrayal, she goes to the nightclub and witnesses with her very eyes that Vip is indeed not the man she knows. The couple argue outside the club and Asha terminates their engagement after it is further revealed that Vip has had more than one instance of his sexual liaisons with other women. During their fight, Champy is seen by his car packing things in the trunk. The scene then cuts to Champy and Asha in an empty bar, with Champy writing down his contact details on his company's promotional sticky note paper and give it to Asha. The story then moves to Nairobi, where Asha is living with her relatives. Unfortunately, her documentary project comes to a temporary obstacle, with her original concept scrapped because of lack of funds from her documentary subject, and she is frustrated at having to start over and look for a new story angle. The story also introduces Matthew, a local who is into the burgeoning hip-hop culture of Nairobi. About the film MTV Europe and Tigerlily Films produced this film to air directly on television on all MTV Networks on 1 December, the World AIDS Day.https://www.upi.com/MTV-to-screen- AIDS-movie-worldwide/74651133025851/ Its goal is to make teenagers think about matters such as sex and relationships. Transit was made as part of MTV's Staying Alive campaign, which aims to raise HIV awareness and reduce discrimination against HIV positive individuals.https://www.upi.com/MTV-to- make-safe-sex-movie/12801094150640/ The movie was partially funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.https://www.svd.se/spelfilm-om-aids-ska-na-en-miljard The film is also available as a free download via the Staying Alive website. Unfortunately this was removed when MTV and the Staying Alive Foundation changed the design of their website in 2008, for the 27th World AIDS Day since the virus, HIV, that eventually leads to the development of AIDS, was discovered.

History  The club has its origins in an ethnically-Turkish recreational football club formed in 1973. Less than ten years later the association registered with Berlin's football federation and began a climb that would see them rival T√ºrkiyemspor Berlin as the city's most prominent side within the Turkish community. The club spent the 90s moving up and down between the Berzirksliga Berlin (VII) and the Landesliga Berlin (VI) before being promoted on the strength of a 2001 Landesliga championship to the Verbandsliga Berlin (V). Two seasons later they claimed the title there and advanced to the NOFV-Oberliga Nord (IV). Ye≈üilyurt enjoyed its most successful season to date in 2001 when they captured the Atat√ºrk Cup in a tournament staged for Turkish clubs in Germany and then emerged as the winners of the Berlin cup competition, known at the time as the Paul Rusch Cup. Their Rusch Cup victory put them through to the opening round of the DFB-Pokal where they went out 4‚Äì2 to then Bundesliga side SC Freiburg. On 16 November 2007 the club withdrew its team from the Oberliga for merging with Berlin AK 07. A new club, SK Yesilyurt 07, was formed, competing in the Kreisliga C, Staffel 4 (XI), the lowest tier in the Berlin league system, in 2008‚Äì09.

Following the lead of other European vanguard movements of the early twentieth century, and taking the Futurist Vladimir Maiakovsky's urgings to heart‚Äîand in the scintillating atmosphere of Lisbon's Baixa district‚Äîthe poets Fernando Pessoa, M√°rio de S√°-Carneiro and Almada Negreiros, and the painters Amadeo de Souza- Cardoso and Guilherme de Santa-Rita joined together to form a journal of art and literature with principal function of agitating, subverting and scandalizing the Portuguese bourgeoisie and - by extension - all social conventions. Orpheu Title page of ORPHEU nr. 1. The journal's name, Orpheu was not chosen by accident - as in Greek myth, Orpheus (Orfeu in Portuguese) was the musician who, to save his wife Eurydice from Hades, had to travel from the world of the living with the stipulation to not looking back. It was this metaphor that was important to the men of the Gera√ß√£o de Orpheu: the not looking back, the forgetting, the relinquishing of the past and the concentration of attention and force to the journey ahead, to the future, for the \\"edification of Portugal in the twentieth century.\\" After bursting onto the Portuguese literary scene in 1915, the journal folded due to financial insolvency, since the father of S√°-Carneiro, unwilling sponsor of the publication, refused the role. Only two issues were published (Jan-Feb-Mar and Apr-May-Jun, 1915). The third issue of Orpheu, that was already in printing proof, was lost during many years and it was finally recovered and published in 1984.Orpheu 3, prepara√ß√£o do texto, introdu√ß√£o e cronologia de Arnaldo Saraiva.

Potentiometric titration is a technique similar to direct titration of a redox reaction. It is a useful means of characterizing an acid. No indicator is used; instead the potential is measured across the analyte, typically an electrolyte solution. To do this, two electrodes are used, an indicator electrode (the glass electrode and metal ion indicator electrode) and a reference electrode. Reference electrodes generally used are hydrogen electrodes, calomel electrodes, and silver chloride electrodes. The indicator electrode forms an electrochemical half cell with the interested ions in the test solution. The reference electrode forms the other half cell. The overall electric potential is calculated as Ecell = Eind \\\\- Eref \\\\+ Esol. Esol is the potential drop over the test solution between the two electrodes. Ecell is recorded at intervals as the titrant is added. A graph of potential against volume added can be drawn and the end point of the reaction is halfway between the jump in voltage. Ecell depends on the concentration of the interested ions with which the indicator electrode is in contact. For example, the electrode reaction may be Mn++ne‚àí\\\\----->M As the concentration of Mn+ changes,the Ecell changes correspondingly. Thus the potentiometric titration involve measurement of Ecell with the addition of titrant. Types of potentiometric titration: acid-base titration (total alkalinity and total acidity), redox titration (HI/HY and cerate), precipitation titration (halides), and complexometric titration (free EDTA and Antical #5). History The first potentiometric titration was carried out in 1893 by Robert Behrend at Ostwald's Institute in Leipzig. He titrated mercurous solution with potassium chloride, potassium bromide, and potassium iodide. He used a mercury electrode along with a mercury/mercurous nitrate reference electrode. He found that in a cell composed of mercurous nitrate and mercurous nitrate/mercury, the initial voltage is 0. If potassium chloride is added to mercurous nitrate on one side, mercury (I) chloride is precipitated. This decreased the osmotic pressure of mercury (I) ions on the side and creates a potential difference. This potential difference increases slowly as additional potassium chloride is added, but then increases more rapidly. He found the greatest potential difference is achieved once all of the mercurous nitrate has been precipitated. This was used to discern end points of titrations.Szabadv√°ry, Ferenc.

Wilhelm Bottger then developed the tool of potentiometric titration while working at Ostwald's Institute.Burns, D. Thorburn, et al. Important Figures of Analytical Chemistry from Germany in Brief Biographies: From the Middle Ages to the Twentieth Century. Springer, 2014. He used potentiometric titration to observe the differences in titration between strong and weak acids, as well as the behavior of polybasic acids. He introduced the idea of using potentiometric titrations for acids and bases that could not be titrated in conjunction with a colorimetric indicator Potentiometric titrations were first used for redox titrations by Crotogino. He titrated halide ions using potassium permanganate using a shiny platinum electrode and a calomel electrode. He says that if an oxidizing agent is added to a reducing solution then the equilibrium between the reducing substance and reaction product will shift towards the reaction product. The changes the potential very slowly until the amount of reducing substance becomes very small. A large change in potential will occur then once a small addition of the titrating solution is added, as the final amounts of reducing agent are removed and the potential corresponds solely to the oxidizing agent. This large increase in potential difference signifies the endpoint of the reaction.

Early commercial Fleming valves used in radio receivers, 1919 Fleming valve schematic from US Patent 803,684. The Fleming valve, also called the Fleming oscillation valve, was a thermionic valve or vacuum tube invented in 1904 by English physicist John Ambrose Fleming as a detector for early radio receivers used in electromagnetic wireless telegraphy. It was the first practical vacuum tube and the first thermionic diode, a vacuum tube whose purpose is to conduct current in one direction and block current flowing in the opposite direction. The thermionic diode was later widely used as a rectifier ‚Äî a device which converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC) ‚Äî in the power supplies of a wide range of electronic devices, until beginning to be replaced by the selenium rectifier in the early 1930s and almost completely replaced by the semiconductor diode in the 1960s. The Fleming valve was the forerunner of all vacuum tubes, which dominated electronics for 50 years. The IEEE has described it as \\"one of the most important developments in the history of electronics\\", and it is on the List of IEEE Milestones for electrical engineering. How it works Valve receiver made by Marconi Co. has two Fleming valves, in case one burns out The valve consists of an evacuated glass bulb containing two electrodes: a cathode in the form of a \\"filament\\", a loop of carbon or fine tungsten wire, similar to that used in the light bulbs of the time, and an anode (plate) consisting of a sheet metal plate. Although in early versions the anode was a flat metal plate placed next to the cathode, in later versions it became a metal cylinder surrounding the cathode. In some versions, a grounded copper screen surrounded the bulb to shield against the influence of external electric fields. In operation, a separate current flows through the cathode \\"filament\\", heating it so that some of the electrons in the metal gain sufficient energy to escape their parent atoms into the vacuum of the tube, a process called thermionic emission. The AC to be rectified is applied between the filament and the plate. When the plate has a positive voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are attracted to it and an electric current flows from filament to plate. In contrast, when the plate has a negative voltage with respect to the filament, the electrons are not attracted to it and no current flows through the tube (unlike the filament, the plate does not emit electrons). As current can pass through the valve in one direction only, it therefore \\"rectifies\\" an AC to a pulsing DC current. This simple operation was somewhat complicated by the presence of residual air in the valve, as the vacuum pumps of Fleming's time were unable to create as high a vacuum as exists in modern vacuum tubes. At high voltages, the valve could become unstable and oscillate, but this occurred at voltages far above those normally used. History The Fleming valve was the first practical application of thermionic emission, discovered in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie. As a result of his work on the incandescent light bulb, Thomas Edison made his own discovery of the phenomenon in 1880, which led to it being called the Edison effect. Edison was granted a patent for this device as part of an electrical indicator in 1884, but did not find a practical use for it. Professor Fleming of University College London consulted for the Edison Electric Light Company from 1881-1891, and subsequently for the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. In 1901 Fleming designed the transmitter used by Guglielmo Marconi in the first transmission of radio waves across the Atlantic from Poldhu, England, to Nova Scotia, Canada. The distance between the two points was about . Although the contact, reported November 12, 1901, was widely heralded as a great scientific advance at the time, there is also some skepticism about the claim, because the received signal, the three dots of the Morse code letter \\"S\\", was so weak the primitive receiver had difficulty distinguishing it from atmospheric radio noise caused by static discharges, leading later critics to suggest it may have been random noise. Regardless, it was clear to Fleming that reliable transatlantic communication with the existing transmitter required more sensitive receiving apparatus. Thermionic diode valves derived from the Fleming valve, from the 1930s (left) to the 1970s (right) The receiver for the transatlantic demonstration employed a coherer, which had poor sensitivity and degraded the tuning of the receiver. This led Fleming to look for a detector which was more sensitive and reliable while at the same time being better suited for use with tuned circuits.Radio Communications: A Brief SynopsisJohn Ambrose Fleming (1849-1945) By W A Atherton, Published in Wireless World August 1990 In 1904 Fleming tried an Edison effect bulb for this purpose, and found that it worked well to rectify high frequency oscillations and thus allow detection of the rectified signals by a galvanometer. On November 16, 1904, he applied for a US patent for what he termed an oscillation valve. This patent was subsequently issued as number 803,684 and found immediate utility in the detection of messages sent by Morse code. The Fleming valve was used by the Marconi company in its shipboard receivers until around 1916, when it was replaced by the triode. =Oscillation valves= The Fleming valve proved to be the start of a technological revolution. After reading Fleming's 1905 paper on his oscillation valve, American engineer Lee de Forest in 1906 created a three- element vacuum tube, the Audion, by adding a wire grid between cathode and anode. It was the first electronic amplifying device, allowing the creation of amplifiers and continuous wave oscillators. De Forest quickly refined his device into the triode, which became the basis of long-distance telephone and radio communications, radars, and early digital computers for 50 years, until the advent of the transistor in the 1960s. Fleming sued De Forest for infringing his valve patents, resulting in decades of expensive and disruptive litigation, which were not settled until 1943 when the United States Supreme Court ruled Fleming's patent invalid.The Supreme Court invalidated the patent because of an improper disclaimer and later maintained the technology in the patent was known art when filed. For more see, Misreading the Supreme Court: A Puzzling Chapter in the History of Radio. Mercurians.org. =Power applications= Later, when vacuum tube equipment began to be powered from wall power by transformers instead of batteries, the Fleming valve was developed into a rectifier to produce the DC plate (anode) voltage required by other vacuum tubes. Around 1914 Irving Langmuir at General Electric developed a high voltage version called the Kenotron which was used to power x-ray tubes. As a rectifier, the tube was used for high voltage applications but its high internal resistance made it inefficient in low voltage, high current applications. Until vacuum tube equipment was replaced by transistors in the 1970s, radios and televisions usually had one or more diode tubes.

Priorities include the development of blight resistant all- American chestnuts and economical biological control measures against chestnut blight in the forest environment. ACCF supports American chestnut research and engages senior citizens and school children, volunteers and professionals in planting, grafting and managing the fruits of this research. Breeding for blight resistance is currently pursued by two separate foundations: The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) is developing advanced hybrids, building on the work of earlier breeders to improve tree form while enhancing resistance; the American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation is not using Oriental genes for blight resistance, but intercrossing among American chestnuts selected for native resistance to the blight. \\"All-American intercrosses\\" defines the breeding strategy of the ACCF; John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and professor emeritus of chemistry at Concord University, and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at Virginia Tech, think there may be several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. By making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they expect to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Planting nutgrafts of blight resistant American chestnuts in an ACCF research orchard Griffin developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant Americans were made beginning in 1980. The first all-American intercrosses are planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in Giles County, VA, and in Beckley, WV. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 & 1992\\\\. Nine of them showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test. Blight resistant American chestnut sapling It appears that inheritance of resistance requires genes of two trees with good combining ability from each source location. Thus, more generations of controlled crosses may be required to make American chestnuts produce blight resistance that is regularly inherited by seednuts. It takes at least 7 years for an American chestnut to produce nuts, and new trees must be at least 5 years old before their resistance can be tested by inoculation; the test requires 2 years for evaluation. Some of this time may be saved by utilizing grafts, and further progress may result from Elkins' studies underway, to locate chemical markers for resistance. In the meanwhile, ACCF plantings of all-American intercrosses are producing, from open pollinations, large nut crops. Meanwhile, the potential for significant blight resistance to be randomly expressed in the nuts ACCF sends out has increased, following the culling of large numbers of mature trees which did not pass resistance tests in their largest orchard. The ACCF is always in need of more good cooperating growers, to help carry on the all-American breeding program, by raising nuts and seedlings and reporting their progress to a central data base. Gary Griffin inspecting superficial blight cankers on grafted resistant American chestnut Many ACCF chestnuts have expressed blight resistance equal to an original blight survivor but so far, only a handful have demonstrated superior, durable blight control. Time will tell if the progeny of these best chestnuts exhibit durable blight resistance in different stress environments.

There was then a shift in terminology with bicompact spaces being called just \\"compact\\" and no generally accepted name for the first concept, some calling it \\"Fr√©chet compactness\\", others the \\"Bolzano-Weierstrass property\\". He says he invented the term \\"limit point compact\\" to have something at least descriptive of the property. Munkres, p. 178-179.Steen & Seebach, p. 19 or weakly countably compactSteen & Seebach, p. 19 if every infinite subset of X has a limit point in X. This property generalizes a property of compact spaces. In a metric space, limit point compactness, compactness, and sequential compactness are all equivalent. For general topological spaces, however, these three notions of compactness are not equivalent. Properties and examples * In a topological space, subsets without limit point are exactly those that are closed and discrete in the subspace topology. So a space is limit point compact if and only if all its closed discrete subsets are finite. * A space X is not limit point compact if and only if it has an infinite closed discrete subspace. Since any subset of a closed discrete subset of X is itself closed in X and discrete, this is equivalent to require that X has a countably infinite closed discrete subspace. * Some examples of spaces that are not limit point compact: (1) The set \\\\Bbb{R} of all real numbers with its usual topology, since the integers are an infinite set but do not have a limit point in \\\\Bbb{R}; (2) an infinite set with the discrete topology; (3) the countable complement topology on an uncountable set. * Every countably compact space (and hence every compact space) is limit point compact. * For T1 spaces, limit point compactness is equivalent to countable compactness. * An example of limit point compact space that is not countably compact is obtained by \\"doubling the integers\\", namely, taking the product X=\\\\Bbb{Z}\\\\times Y where \\\\Bbb{Z} is the set of all integers with the discrete topology and Y=\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} has the indiscrete topology. The space X is homeomorphic to the odd-even topology.Steen & Seebach, Example 6 This space is not T0. It is limit point compact because every nonempty subset has a limit point. * An example of T0 space that is limit point compact and not countably compact is X=\\\\Bbb{R}, the set of all real numbers, with the right order topology, i.e., the topology generated by all intervals (x,\\\\infty).Steen & Seebach, Example 50 The space is limit point compact because given any point a\\\\in X, every x is a limit point of \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\}. * For metrizable spaces, compactness, countable compactness, limit point compactness, and sequential compactness are all equivalent. * The continuous image of a limit point compact space need not be limit point compact. For example, if X=\\\\Bbb{Z}\\\\times Y with \\\\Bbb{Z} discrete and Y indiscrete as in the example above, the map f=\\\\pi_{\\\\Bbb{Z}} given by projection onto the first coordinate is continuous, but f(X)=\\\\Bbb{Z} is not limit point compact. * A limit point compact space need not be pseudocompact. An example is given by the same X=\\\\Bbb{Z}\\\\times Y with Y indiscrete two-point space and the map f=\\\\pi_{\\\\Bbb{Z}}, whose image is not bounded in \\\\Bbb{R}. * A pseudocompact space need not be limit point compact. An example is given by an uncountable set with the cocountable topology. * Every normal pseudocompact space is limit point compact.Steen & Seebach, p. 20. What they call \\"normal\\" is T4 in wikipedia's terminology, but it's essentially the same proof as here. Proof: Suppose X is a normal space that is not limit point compact. There exists a countably infinite closed discrete subset A=\\\\\\\\{x_n:n=1,2,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} of X. By the Tietze extension theorem the continuous function f on A defined by f(x_n)=n can be extended to an (unbounded) real-valued continuous function on all of X. So X is not pseudocompact. * Limit point compact spaces have countable extent. *If (X, T) and (X, T*) are topological spaces with T* finer than T and (X, T*) is limit point compact, then so is (X, T).

Synopsis A poor woman longed for a child. One day, she saw a little snake in the forest and said that even snakes had children; the little snake offered to be hers. The woman and her husband raised the snake. When it was grown, it wanted to marry, and not to another snake but to the king's daughter. The father went to ask, and the king said that the snake should have her if he could turn all the fruit in the orchard into gold. The snake told his father to gather up all the pits he could find and sow them in the orchard; when they sprang up, all the fruits were gold. The king then demanded that the walls and paths of his palace be turned to precious stones; the snake had his father gathered up broken crockery and threw it at the walls and paths, which transformed them, making them glitter with the many coloured gems. The king then demanded that the castle be turned to gold; the snake had his father rub the walls with a herb, which transformed them. The king told his daughter, Grannonia, he had tried to put off this suitor but failed. Grannonia said that she would obey him. The snake came in a car of gold, drawn by elephants; everyone else ran off in fright, but Grannonia stood her ground. The snake took her into a room, where he shed his skin and became a handsome young man. The king, fearing that his daughter was being eaten, looked through the keyhole, and seeing this, grabbed the skin and burned it. The youth exclaimed that the king was a fool, turned into a dove, and flew off. Grannonia set out in search of him. She met a fox and traveled with him. In the morning as the princess remarked on the wondrous sounds of the birdsongs, the fox told her the birdsong would be even better if she knew what the birds were saying: that a prince had been cursed to take a snake's form for seven years, that near the end of the time, he had fallen in love with and married a princess, but that his snake skin had been burned, and he had struck his head while he fled, and was now in the care of doctors. The fox then told her that the blood of the birds would cure him, and he caught them for her. Then he told her that his blood was also needed; she persuaded him to go with her and killed him. She went to her husband's father and promised to cure the prince if he would marry her; the king agreed and she cured him. The prince refused because he had already pledged himself to another woman. The princess, pleased, revealed that she was that woman and they married. Commentary The urging of her father to marry the beast because he had promised her represents a factor clearly present in arranged marriages. This tale has been interpreted as symbolically representing an arranged marriage; the bride's revulsion to marrying a stranger being symbolized by his bestial form.Maria Tatar, Off with Their Heads! p. 140-1 See also *The Blue Bird *The Canary Prince *The Green Knight *The Snake Prince *The Three Sisters References Category:Italian fairy tales Category:Fiction about shapeshifting Category:Fictional snakes ","title":"The Enchanted Snake"},{"id":"9861571","text":"Susan Sherouse is an American violinist from Lakeland, Florida.

Design and development Designed to meet a requirement for a pleasure flying airliner from Sir Alan Cobham (an Airspeed director), the Ferry was an unusual configuration biplane with a third engine mounted in the upper wing (it was usual to mount a third engine in the nose). The engine arrangement was designed to give the pilot a better view. Not all three engines were the same, the lower engines were de Havilland Gipsy IIs, and the upper wing had an inverted de Havilland Gipsy III. The lower wing was mounted at the top of the fuselage to give passengers an unobstructed view of the ground. Operational history The first aircraft G-ABSI Youth of Britain II first flew on 10 April 1932 from Sherburn-in-Elmet Airfield, followed soon after by the second aircraft G-ABSJ Youth of Britain III. In the first season of operating, the two aircraft carried 92,000 passengers.\\"The Work of the Airspeed Ferry\\". Flight, 17 November 1932, p. 1088.

It later became an instructional airframe registered as 2758M. The second aircraft was sold in India to Himalaya Air Transport and Survey Company Limited in 1934 as VT-AFO. It was used to ferry pilgrims from Hardwar to Gaucher, and was destroyed by vandals in a hangar fire in 1936. The third (G-ACBT) and fourth (G-ACFB) aircraft were built for the Midland and Scottish Air Ferries Ltd and used on services from Renfrew to Campbeltown, Belfast and Speke. The firm closed in 1934 and the aircraft were put up for sale. G-ACBT was not sold and was dismantled in 1941. G-ACFB returned to England to be used for pleasure flying for Air Publicity Ltd.

Biography Born in Antwerp, Frey was one of three children. She was trained as a dressmaker, a trade which she later taught as a school teacher. As with many Belgian families, the Freys left their home in the First World War, moving to Ostend. There Alice met painter James Ensor who became a close friend. Ensor encouraged her interest in art, and after the war she enrolled as student in the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, where she studied drawing and painting. It was as a student that she met her future husband Georges Marlier, himself later a noted art critic and painter. They married in 1922. Together they formed part of a group known as Lumi√®re, which published a journal. A second journal, √áa Ira, was established by Frey, and these formed part of the avant-garde movement in Belgium in the 1920s. Frey's work was widely exhibited in her lifetime. In her later years she became profoundly deaf and lived alone in Ostend. On her death in 1981, much of her work was sold at auction, and only the small collection that she willed to Ostend is readily accessible. Stylistically, Frey's work was influenced by Marc Chagall, Ensor, and Edgard Tytgat. Her early works are expressionist, while her later work may be closer to magic realism.

It is only used in veterinary applications.  Properties  Cefquinome is resistant to beta-lactamase. Chemically, its zwitterionic structure can facilitate rapid penetration across biological membranes, including porins of bacterial cell walls. Plus, it has a higher affinity to target penicillin-binding proteins. The reactive site is a beta-lactam nucleus, while the main peripheral functional groups are a quaternary quinolinium, an aminothiazolyl moiety and an unusual O-alkylated oxime. Cefquinome acts by inhibition of the cell wall synthesis, but it has a relatively short half-life of about 2.5 hours. It is less than 5% protein bound and is excreted unchanged in the urine.Intervet, \\"Cephaguard Injection Data Sheet,\\"  Studies  Many studies have been conducted, mostly for animal use. One such study was conducted by the Pharma Research in Germany. = Test groups = Groups of albino mice, weighing 191 g, were dosed with 10 and 40 mg of cefquinome per kg. Blood samples were obtained from a cut at the tip of the tail and kept at 4¬∞C. Urine was collected in metabolism cages. Three male beagle dogs, weighing about 22 kg each, were dosed with 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg at the cephalic vein. Blood samples were drawn from the same vein in the opposite leg. Meanwhile, urine was collected by catheterization. Pigs, five or six male and female in each group weighing about 18 kg each, were injected with 10 mg of cefquinome at the vena jugularis in the base of the left ear. Blood samples were withdrawn from the contralateral jugular vein. Male and female calves weighing between 110 and 140 kg were dosed with 10 mg of cefquinome per kg through the vena jugularis. Standard solutions were prepared from pooled murine blood and urine taken from untreated dogs, pigs, and calves. = Calculations = Cefquinome concentrations were calculated by regression analysis, using the standard curves in which logarithms of the concentration were proportional to the areas of the inhibition zones. Curve fitting was carried out by nonlinear regression with the computer program PHAKOK. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the concentration-time data after administration indicated that the best curve fits were usually achieved by using an open two-compartment model. = Conclusion = Data indicate that cefquinome has high antibacterial activity in vitro against nearly all strains tested. In general, cefquinome is within the same range as cefpirome and cefotaxime. Against Gram-negative species, cefquinome has very limited in vitro activity. The in vitro activity of cefquinome does not depend on the composition or pH of the test medium. The broad antibacterial spectrum and the high in vitro activity are reflected by high in vivo efficacy in experimental infections. In mouse models of septicaemia, cefquinome possessed high therapeutic efficacy. All infections were cured.  Intervet  Intervet developed cefquinome (Cobactan) to treat bovine respiratory disease, the most common disease in cattle. An injection, containing 25 mg cefquinome per ml, is given to cattle and pigs. = Treatment = In cattle, the injection should help against respiratory disease caused by Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. It also helps with acute E. coli mastitis, dermatitis, infectious bulbar necrosis, and interdigital necrobacillosis. In calves, it is effective against E. coli septicaemia. For pigs, it is used to treat bacterial infections of the lungs and respiratory tract caused by P. multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis. Mastitis-metritis-agalactia syndrome involved with E. coli, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and other cefquinome-sensitive organisms are also treated. In piglets, the mortality rate in cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus suis is reduced. It is used in the treatment of mild or moderate lesions caused by Staphylococcus hyicus and arthritis caused by Streptococcus spp. and E. coli. = Caution/warnings = These are some factors to be aware of before treating: * This product should not be used in animals known to be hypersensitive to Œ≤-lactam antibiotics. * It should not be administered to animals with a body weight less than 1.25 kg. * Use of the product may result in localised tissue reaction. Tissue lesions are repaired by 15 days after the last administration of the product. * Hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins occur rarely. * The product does not contain an antimicrobial preservative. * To prevent the claimed infections in piglets, attention should be paid to hygiene and ventilation, and overcrowding should be avoided. When the first piglets are affected, careful examination of all animals in the same pen is recommended to enable an early treatment of any other infected piglets.  Clinical usage  = Human use = Cefquinome is not approved for human use. = Veterinary medicine = Conditions of use are limited to therapeutic, parenteral, and individual animal use. Individual parenteral therapy of bovine respiratory disease data on cefquinome-related residues demonstrate only very small amounts are present in the intestinal tract of treated cattle with gastrointestinal activation. However, treatment should be short, meaning a single injection daily for about a week. Treatment should only be given by prescription. Cefquinome should not be used in feed or water. Since 1994, in Europe, it was allowed to treat cattle by prescription only. In 1999, swine were included. By 2005, horses were allowed as well. In the United States, approval is pending for treatment of bovine respiratory disease. Even so, this is only available by prescription. Cefquinome is also used for other illnesses, such as ‚Äúshipping fever‚Äù, a pneumonia-like illness commonly found in cattle.Associated Press, \\"Farmers, doctors battle over new drug for dairy cows,\\" April 5, 2007, State and Regional  Concerns  = Resistance and food-borne transmission = Of concern, the use of the drug in animals may lead to increases in antibiotic resistance. Humans can be exposed to bacteria through food-borne transmission, raising chances of becoming exposed to resistant bacterial species, such as Salmonella or E. coli. The potential for the development of antibiotic resistance increases as usage increases, by selecting bacteria which have acquired beta-lactamases. = Salmonella = The use may cause resistance in Salmonella present in the intestinal tract of the target animal. Resistant Salmonella may also contaminate the carcass at slaughter and transfer to humans when used as food. When humans are infected and treated with a fourth-generation cephalosporin, effectiveness may be compromised. Although fourth-generation cephalosporin resistance is very rare, they are active against bacteria carrying the AmpC-type Œ≤-lactamase resistance mechanism. Since the late 1990s, the US and EU have surveyed and gathered data for fourth-generation cephalosporins for both human and veterinary use. Data indicate no changes occur in resistance patterns of relevant food-borne pathogens.  FDA guidelines  * Administered products will be used in individual animals for short duration and by prescription only. * The extent of use is ranked low. * Avoid human drug resistance to fourth-generation cephalosporins by authorizing extra-label prohibition.  Synthesis  Broad- spectrum fourth generation injectable aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. Hoechst). Cefotaxime (1) is a potent cephalosporin antibiotic in its own right. Further modification of this drug by inclusion of a quaternary ammonium cation gives a compound suitable for parenteral administration by increasing water solubility. The acid in cefotaxime is first protected as its silyl ester (2) by derivatization with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Treatment of this intermediate with trimethylsilyl iodide gives the allylic iodide (3). Displacement of halogen with 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoline (2,3-cyclohexenopyridine) gives the corresponding quaternary salt. Hydrolysis of the silyl ester followed by adjustments of the pH leads to the betaine cefquinome (4).

(text version also available) (if links above fail to load report, visit http://dotlibrary.specialcollection.net and select \\"Historical Aircraft Accident Reports (1934-1965)\\", then retry report links) Flight 67 was the first of four fatal crashes in the space of two years involving Capital Airlines Vickers Viscounts;Capital Airlines accidents and incidents the others were Capital Airlines Flight 300 (May 1958), Capital Airlines Flight 75 (May 1959), and Capital Airlines Flight 20 (January 1960). Approach conditions towards Freeland were poor due to the weather; there was restricted visibility, and conditions were ripe for icing. The plane's crew apparently attempted a steep turn to align the craft with the runway. This caused the plane to stall, which was followed by a spin. The crew could not regain control, leading to the crash. The official cause of the crash was listed as an undetected buildup of ice on the horizontal stabilizer which, coupled with airspeed and the design of the aircraft, caused it to lose control. Furthermore, the aircraft's stall warning device was inoperative. A memorial to the victims was unveiled in a local cemetery in 2001.

It won a Mensa Select award in 1996. The Washington Post described it as \\"like poker for kids\\". It is similar to the 2010 card game Cabo as well as to the card game Golf that uses a standard 52-card deck. Cards The game consists of a deck of cards: four sets of cards numbered from 0 through to 8, nine copies of a 9 card, and three of each of the power cards (\\"Peek\\", \\"Swap\\" and \\"Draw 2\\"). Setup Each player is dealt four cards that are placed, face down, in a row in front of him or her. Each player looks at the two outermost cards in their row, at the beginning of the game. Players may not look at any cards during the game except through the use of a Peek card. The remaining cards form a draw pile, and the top one is turned over to form a discard pile (if this card is a power card, it is shuffled back into the draw pile and a replacement is dealt). Gameplay The objective is to have the fewest points at the end of the game. The points are the total of all cards that the person has at the end of the round. Therefore, players try to get rid of high value cards and gain low ones. Since cards are left face down, memory is a very important part of this game. On a player's turn, he or she takes a card. This can either be the top card of the discard pile (so long as it is not a \\"power card\\"), or the top card of the draw pile. Anyone who takes a card from the discard pile uses it to replace one of his or her face down cards, and puts that card on the discard pile. If a player draws a number card from the draw pile, they may either use it to replace one of the face-down cards, or place the drawn card directly in the discard pile. If the draw pile is exhausted, the discard pile is reshuffled and placed face down. Power cards may only be used when they are drawn from the draw pile. They may not be taken from the discard pile, and are useless if found in the hand. After use, they are placed in the discard pile. If a power card is taken from the draw pile, it has the following effect: *If a \\"Peek\\" card is drawn, the player may immediately look at one of his or her face down cards. *If a \\"Swap\\" is drawn, the player may switch one of his cards with one of another player's cards. However, the player may not look at either card until receiving a peek card. If the player does not want to swap, he or she does not have to. *A player drawing a \\"Draw 2\\" card then draws another card from the pile, and may use this card as if it were a normal turn. However, if it is a number card and is discarded, or if it is a power card and the player decides not to use it, the player then picks another card from the pile, and plays that as if it were a normal turn. At the end of a player's turn, he or she may choose to end the round by saying \\"rat-a-tat-cat\\". All other players get one more turn, and then everyone counts up their points. Any power cards are placed at the bottom of the deck and replaced with the top card. At the beginning of the game, the players decide how to win. They may either play for an agreed length of time or number of rounds, with the person with the fewest points at the end being the winner, or the game may be played such that when a player exceeds a certain points total, they are eliminated, with the last surviving player winning the game.

Early life Guerin was born on 23 April 1858 in Williamstown, Victoria. She was the daughter of Julia Margaret (n√©e Kearney) and Patrick Guerin; her parents were both born in Ireland. Her father worked as a penal sergeant and rose to the rank of governor of gaols. Having studied at home to pass matriculation in 1878, Bella became the first woman to graduate from an Australian university when she gained her B.A. from the University of Melbourne in December 1883, becoming M.A. upon application in 1885. Career =Teaching= She taught first at Loreto College, Victoria, urging higher education scholarships for Catholic girls to produce 'a band of noble thoughtful women as a powerful influence for good'. She married civil servant and poet Henry Halloran at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 29 June 1891. Halloran, then aged 80, had addressed a laudatory poem to her after seeing a graduation portrait in 1884. He died in Sydney on 19 May 1893, leaving her with an infant son, Henry Marco. A second marriage at Christ Church, St Kilda, Melbourne on 1 October 1909 to George D'Arcie Lavender, thirty years her junior, was apparently short lived. Returning to teaching from financial necessity, Bella taught in Sydney, then Carlton, Prahran and East Melbourne. From the mid-1890s she frequented suffragist circles, becoming office-bearer in the Bendigo Women's Franchise League while running University College, Bendigo from 1898 - 1903. From 1904 to 1917 she taught at Camperdown and in a succession of small Melbourne schools at South Yarra, St Kilda, Parkville and Brunswick with diminishing success. Her increasing political activity and disputes over conditions with the Education Department probably contributed to this outcome. =Women's Political Association= As vice- president of the Women's Political Association in 1912 - 1914 Guerin co- authored Vida Goldstein's 1913 Senate election pamphlet, but dual membership of non-party feminist and Labor Party organizations proved untenable. From 1914 she wrote and spoke for the Labor and Victorian Socialist parties and the Women's League of Socialists, and was recognized as a 'witty, cogent and instructive' commentator on a range of controversial social issues; they included the rights of illegitimate children, \\"brotherhood and sisterhood without sex distinction\\" and defence of English militant suffragettes. =Anti-war= An ardent anti-war propagandist, she led the Labor Women's Anti-Conscription Fellowship campaign during the 1916 referendum and spoke in Adelaide, Broken Hill and Victorian metropolitan and country centres against militarism and in defence of rights of assembly and free speech. =Politics= Appointed vice-president of the Australian Labor Party's Women's Central Organizing Committee in March 1918, she aroused censure and controversy for describing Labor women as \\"performing poodles and packhorses\\", under-represented in policy decisions and relegated to auxiliary fund raising roles. Henceforth she organized for Labor \\"only so far as it stands for those principles represented by the Red Flag\\", believing in the parliamentary system but desiring capitalism's elimination. Religion In religion she moved from Roman Catholicism to rationalism. She described her political evolution as from \\"Imperialistic butterfly\\" to \\"democratic grub\\" and experienced continual tensions as a socialist feminist within the Labor Party. Personal life Her son, who practised as a doctor in Adelaide from 1915, described her as 'the kindest and most gentle of women'; she saw herself as a 'national idealist' and an 'incorrigible militant', promoting women's participation in public life. She was regarded as an orator of 'unique talents'. She died in Adelaide on 26 July 1923 of cirrhosis of the liver, aged 65, and was buried in the Catholic cemetery at West Terrace. Legacy Being that Bella Guerin spent time teaching in Ballarat, the University of Ballarat (now known as Federation University Australia) honoured her by naming one of the two Mt Helen campus' Halls of Residence after her (the other being named after Peter Lalor, who led the Eureka Stockade in Ballarat) Guerin Place in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm is named in her honour.

Part of the shared Marvel Universe setting, it centered on a team of superhuman British soldiers, with some plot aspects drawing on the background of Marvel's successful Captain America character. Publication history The series was canceled after eight issues, after the first part of a new storyline, when Marvel UK abruptly ceased publishing new material. Fictional team history The Super Soldiers consisted mostly of individuals modified using biotechnology based on the American supersoldier codenamed Nuke. These characters were part of a British supersoldier program, which had been officially disbanded due to a mission gone wrong, and years later reformed along with other characters such as the rowdy mutant Guvnor, the Savage Land warrior woman Xantia, and the revived (after hibernating since the 1970s) martial artist Dragonfly, to work alongside S.H.I.E.L.D. and the U.S. Agent. In the eighth and final issue of the series, the unit found themselves privatised and their contracts sold to the Mercy Corporation as an \\"autonomous superhero response unit\\". Team leader Joseph Hauer, appeared during a briefing alongside Pete Wisdom, Captain Britain and Union Jack on the details of the British Superhuman Registration Act by Contessa Valentina Allegro de Fontaine, Alistaire Stuart and Commander Lance Hunter as part of the superhuman Civil War. Years later the Super Soldiers had retired and written a book about their exploits; a (bad) movie was made of their book, with Gog, Guvnor, and Dalton playing themselves (as part of the contract and they could barely act) and Hauer as advisor. Most people considered them embarrassing relics, including Pete Wisdom who came to warn them about attacks on British superheroes but had no interest in recruiting them. When Mephisto's Psycho-Wraiths attacked the area to capture Hauer, the Super-Soldiers refused to withdraw but instead sacrificed themselves to allow civilians to escape.Revolutionary War: Super- Soldiers by Rob Williams and Brent Anderson (March 2014) Hauer was freed and helped defeat Hell's invasion of Earth, gunning down a demonic Killpower.

KODS airs a classic hits music format branded as \\"The River\\" (a local reference to the Truckee River). The station's studios are located on Matley Lane in East Reno, and its transmitter is located on Slide Mountain. History The station, now owned by Reno Media Group, began as KNLT in 1970 with a transmitter on Brockway Summit, between Truckee, CA and Lake Tahoe. Its signal could be heard only in Truckee and in a small section of Tahoe's north shore, including Kings Beach and Carnelian Bay. Tom Quinn and a handful of investors purchased the station, then known as KEZC, in 1982. Within two years, Quinn petitioned the FCC to increase the station's power and he relocated the transmitter to Slide Mountain overlooking Reno, Carson City and Lake Tahoe. The station, with new call-letters KHTX and known as \\"K-Hits 104,\\" had instant ratings success in the Reno radio market. This allowed Quinn to purchase a second station serving the Fresno, California area and then a third in Las Vegas, Nevada. In September 1988, KHTZ, as the station had become known the previous year, changed format from Top 40 to oldies and its call letters to KODS. In doing so, the station regained its position as the top-rated station in Reno. In the late 1990s, KODS began using the nickname \\"The River\\" and in Incline Village the nickname \\"Fun 101\\" reflecting its use of a translator at 101.3 FM. Except during specialty programs, KODS eventually dropped most of its 1950s and early 1960s music and thus transitioned to a classic hits rather than oldies format. KODS is now part of the nine-station Reno Media Group/Americom family of stations.

The founding parents, Jackie and Steve Brand, wanted to find tools that their 7-year-old daughter, Shoshana, could use - as her fine motor coordination and vision were both impaired. Steve took a sabbatical from his teaching job at Berkeley High School to explore the emerging technologies. A friend, Steve Gensler of Unicorn Engineering (later known as IntelliTools) had developed a large flat keyboard alternative. Arjan Khalsa, who later became President of Unicorn, was also involved from the beginning. When Steve and Jackie had found some answers, they felt it was natural to share what they had learned with other parents and teachers. They organized a community meeting in Berkeley which was attended by over one hundred parents, teachers, computer buffs, and adults with disabilities. The West Contra Costa Unified School District provided classroom space for the new organization, which received non-profit status in 1985. Parents from around the country began to contact the group and Apple Computer came on board as an early sponsor. The original Apple IIe had the ability to speak text aloud, when paired with an Echo Speech Synthesizer and software from UCLA. Founding Board members also included Linda DeLucchi and Larry Malone, of the Center for Multi-Sensory Learning at the Lawrence Hall of Science. They served the organization from 1985‚Äì2002, while developing accessible hands-on science curriculum and FOSS - Full Option Science System. Jackie Brand served as Executive Director of DCCG until 1989. She was joined by Associate Director Mary Lester, who served from 1986-1995. Jackie went on to found the Alliance for Technology Access (first known at the National Special Education Alliance and a.k.a. the Foundation for Technology Access) which supported the creation and growth of a network of 40 centers around the country, based on the DCCG model. Jackie Brand has received numerous honors for her pioneering work in the field of assistive technology advocacy. She is a powerful spokesperson for the power of technology in the lives of people with disabilities, at conference, in videotapes made about DCCG, and in a PBS documentary Freedom Machines. Mary Lester joined Jackie at the ATA in 1995 and remains as the current Executive Director. The ATA continues to work for greater access for people with disabilities and has developed a close partnership with CTC.net, a network of over 1000 grassroots community technology centers. DCCG became the Center for Accessible Technology in 1995. Lisa Wahl served as Executive Director from 1990-2000. During that time the Center greatly expanded services to schools, providing teacher training and consultant services for individual students. A certificate program with San Francisco State University provided indepth training for over 40 teachers from around the Bay and was replicated at the Computer Access Center in Los Angeles. The Center worked with a local company, InfoUse, to develop PlaneMath, web-based math curriculum that modeled accessibility and inspired youth with disabilities to think about careers in aviation, which was funded by NASA. They also partnered on the development of MathPad, software that was distributed by IntelliTools. The Center received recognition from the California Speech Language and Hearing Association, and was named a Digital Pioneer in 1997 by KQED and San Francisco Sidewalk. During the 1980s and 1990s, DCCG was unique in recognizing that successful implementation of assistive technology could not focus just on the person with a disability but needed to include most everyone else in their life. For an augmentative communication device to provide speech, the parents, teachers, bus driver, siblings, and playmates of the user needed to be aware of it and to support the use of the device. A concurrent message was that people with disabilities had something to say and something to contribute to our society and that assistive technology was the tool that would make this possible. The Center continues to provide assistive technology services including a large resource center in Berkeley CA. Dmitri Belser has been the Executive Director since 2001. During that time, the Center has continued to be active in the Ed Roberts Campus , a project dedicated to co-housing eight or more disability organizations in a facility to be built at the Ashby BART station.

In 1850 he obtained his medical doctorate, afterwards serving as privat-docent of physiology at Breslau (1854). In 1862 he became an associate professor, later being appointed professor of physiology at the University of Rostock (1865). Aubert is known for his research involving psychophysics, including the way an observer perceives pattern, movement and orientation. He conducted several experiments involving the phenomenon of dark adaptation; namely the eye's ability to regain its sensitivity in the dark after it had been exposed to bright lights. With ophthalmologist Richard F√∂rster (1825‚Äì1902), he performed a series of tests on vision outside the point of fixation, which they referred to as indirect vision. Their findings were published in a treatise called Beitr√§ge zur Kenntniss des indirecten Sehens (1857). From their work the eponymous \\"Aubert-F√∂rster law\\" is derived. Aubert and F√∂rster's data showed that visual acuity changes between central and peripheral vision in an approximately linear fashion with the visual angle of eccentricity. Another eponym associated with him is \\"Aubert's phenomenon\\", an optical illusion involving the factual position of a subjective vertical line when an observer's head is tilted. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the dark. His earlier work dealt with zoological issues, such as studies of Aspidogaster conchicola, and research involving the thorax muscles of insects. With botanist Friedrich Wimmer (1803‚Äì1868), he published a German edition of Aristotle's Historia Animalium.Google Books Historia animalium German & Greek 1868  References  * Imaging and Perimetric Society Measure of Visual Field Limits * Hermann Rudolph Aubert @ Who Named It Category:1826 births Category:1892 deaths Category:German physiologists Category:People from Frankfurt (Oder) Category:Academics of the University of Rostock Category:Knights of the House Order of the Wendish Crown ","title":"Hermann Rudolph Aubert"},{"id":"9862080","title":"1991 Alpine Skiing World Cup ‚Äì Men's Slalom"},{"id":"9862091","text":"Uriel Holmes (August 26, 1764 ‚Äì May 18, 1827) was a United States Representative from Connecticut.

Career As a pianist, Longo often played in chamber ensemble with the Ferni Quartet, and with the Quartetto Napoletano (with Cantani, Parmiciano, Scarano and Viterbini). He founded various musical institutions in Naples, and gained a high reputation as a concert pianist. In 1914 he began editing the review L'Arte Pianistica.This paragraph derived from Arthur Eaglefield Hull, A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians (Dent, London 1924), 87, 303-304. He became Director of the Naples Conservatory in 1944, and died in Naples the following year, aged 80. Legacy Today, Longo is mainly remembered for compiling an almost comprehensive catalogue of the keyboard works of Domenico Scarlatti. For many years, Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas were conventionally identified by their Longo numbers, but these were later superseded by those found in Ralph Kirkpatrick's catalogue. Longo's Catalogue originated in his landmark full publication of the works of Scarlatti in 11 volumesA. Longo, 545 Scarlatti Sonatas in XI Volumes (Ricordi, 1906-1913). and implied particular groupings of the sonatas, the chronology of which was later completely revised and differently grouped in Kirkpatrick's 1953 study of the composer.R. Kirkpatrick, Domenico Scarlatti (Princeton University Press, 1953). Longo also edited works by Domenico Gallo. His compositions include, among others, two works for piano four-hands, a serenade and a suite; suites for piano with bassoon with oboe, with flute and with clarinet. Family life His son, Achille Longo (1900-1954), was also a composer.

In an HHMM each state is considered to be a self-contained probabilistic model. More precisely each state of the HHMM is itself an HHMM. HHMMs and HMMs are useful in many fields, including pattern recognition.  Background  It is sometimes useful to use HMMs in specific structures in order to facilitate learning and generalization. For example, even though a fully connected HMM could always be used if enough training data is available it is often useful to constrain the model by not allowing arbitrary state transitions. In the same way it can be beneficial to embed the HMM into a greater structure; which, theoretically, may not be able to solve any other problems than the basic HMM but can solve some problems more efficiently when it comes to the amount of training data required.  The hierarchical hidden Markov model  In the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) each state is considered to be a self-contained probabilistic model. More precisely each state of the HHMM is itself an HHMM. This implies that the states of the HHMM emit sequences of observation symbols rather than single observation symbols as is the case for the standard HMM states. Illustration of the structure of a HHMM. Gray lines show vertical transitions. The horizontal transitions are shown as black lines. The light gray circles are the internal states and the dark gray circles are the terminal states that returns control to the activating state. The production states are not shown in this figure. When a state in an HHMM is activated, it will activate its own probabilistic model, i.e. it will activate one of the states of the underlying HHMM, which in turn may activate its underlying HHMM and so on. The process is repeated until a special state, called a production state, is activated. Only the production states emit observation symbols in the usual HMM sense. When the production state has emitted a symbol, control returns to the state that activated the production state. The states that do not directly emit observations symbols are called internal states. The activation of a state in an HHMM under an internal state is called a vertical transition. After a vertical transition is completed a horizontal transition occurs to a state within the same level. When a horizontal transition leads to a terminating state control is returned to the state in the HHMM, higher up in the hierarchy, that produced the last vertical transition. Remember that a vertical transition can result in more vertical transitions before reaching a sequence of production states and finally returning to the top level. Thus the production states visited gives rise to a sequence of observation symbols that is \\"produced\\" by the state at the top level. The methods for estimating the HHMM parameters and model structure are more complex than for the HMM and the interested reader is referred to (Fine et al., 1998). The HMM and HHMM belong to the same class of classifiers. That is, they can be used to solve the same set of problems. In fact, the HHMM can be transformed into a standard HMM. However, the HHMM utilizes its structure to solve a subset of the problems more efficiently.  See also  * Layered hidden Markov model * Hierarchical temporal memory  References  *S. Fine, Y.

It is located on Ashbury Avenue in El Cerrito, California, United States. As of the 2014-15 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,364 students and 55.2 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student‚Äìteacher ratio of 24.7:1. There were 572 students (41.9% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 119 (8.7% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.School data for El Cerrito High, National Center for Education Statistics. Accessed December 17, 2019. Overview The original main school building was built in the late 1930s as a WPA project. The school opened to students on January 6, 1941. Student population quickly outgrew the facilities, and the campus became a collection of small, outlying buildings. As concern grew over the building's safety and structural stability, plans were made for more integrated buildings and, in the summer of 2005, demolition of the old campus began. By 2007, the campus had been demolished, and the terrain was leveled in preparation for reconstruction. During the reconstruction, all classes were held in temporary buildings located south of the campus on the former baseball field. The new campus opened on January 5, 2009. El Cerrito's student body is 35.6% African-American, 23.7% Hispanic, 17.2% Asian, 16.7% Caucasian, and 2.5% Filipino. Many of these students are actually mixed race, making El Cerrito a very diverse high school. Half of students come from families with a low enough income to qualify for free or reduced price lunches under the National School Lunch Act. Many students come from the neighboring city of Richmond, which is also served by the West Contra Costa Unified School District. =Art Programs= Before the bankruptcy of the Richmond Unified School District, El Cerrito High School was a regional magnet for the arts. Recovery from the bankruptcy coincided with less available funds, slowing recovery, but the rebuilt school has a theater that has been used by professional organizations such as West Edge Opera.

The inhabitants are referred to as the Sillegnois. Geography Sillegny is located in the Seille Valley, a floodplain along the Seille river which flows near the village. In the west, the C√¥tes de Moselle massif and its outliers dominate the region. Loiville, a hamlet belonging to the commune, is situated in the north, over the R√ª des Crux in the direction of Coin-sur-Seille. History The Roman road which connected Lyon to Trier runs west from the village along the For√™t Dominale des Six Cantons forest. Ruins of a villa were found near this road, what is a proof of the ancient occupation of Sillegny. Furthermore, the suffix \\"-y\\" comes from the Latin suffix \\"-iacum\\" (which comes himself from the Gaulish language \\"-ac\\") indicates a rural estate near a stream (the Seille river). In the 11th century, Sillegny belonged to the abbey of Saint Pierre, and one century later to the Bishopric of Metz. In 1226 the name of the town changed and became Sulincium. In 1246 the bishop Jacques ceded the village to Sainte Marie abbey but the Diocese kept St. Martin church until the French Revolution. In 1635, at the end of the Thirty Years' War, Sillegny was nearly destroyed by the Swedish and the church became a pilgrimage place. From 1871 to 1918 and between 1940 and 1945, when Alsace and Lorraine were annexed by Germany (see Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)), Sillegny became a German town renamed Sillningen situated in the Imperial Province of Elsass-Lothringen. The bombings of 1944 destroyed almost all the village. During the German period, casemates (fortified gun emplacements) were built in the For√™t Dominale des Six Cantons, near Les Jurieux and Marly-aux-Bois (close to the Roman road) and along the D 67 road.

A Vickers Viscount flying the route crashed in Chase, Maryland, on May 12, 1959, with the loss of all on board. The crash was the third of four involving a Capital Airlines Vickers Viscount in less than two years; the other three were Capital Airlines Flight 67 (April 1958), Capital Airlines Flight 300 (May 1958), and Capital Airlines Flight 20 (January 1960). The flight left the terminal at La Guardia at 3:20 in the afternoon, 20 minutes behind schedule, and took off at 3:29. It then climbed to 14,000 feet before coming onto the assigned airway, Victor 3. At 4:02, the crew contacted Washington Center, reporting over Westchester, and estimating Westminster to be fifteen minutes away. In the same message, they noted that there were thunderstorms along the assigned course, and requested permission to navigate clear of the weather a little south of Westminster. The air traffic controller acknowledged the message and gave the go-ahead. At 4:10 the flight called again, the pilots noting that they had slowed somewhat to account for turbulence. This was the last message sent by the flight crew; three minutes later, the plane entered an area of severe turbulence, lost control, and entered a steep descent. It is believed that the craft reached an airspeed of 335 knots, fully 15 percent more than the Viscount's never exceed speed, and about 5 percent in excess of the maximum speed demonstrated when the plane was certified. Consequently, at about 5000 feet both of the horizontal stabilizers failed at once, separating downward. The separation caused the plane to pitch violently nose-down; the gyroscopic loads combined with inertia to cause all four engine nacelles to break upward. Both wings were then subjected to extreme downloads. Under the pressure, the right wing separated, and the integrity of the left was completely destroyed. With so much of the aircraft's superstructure gone, the left wing induced drag on the fuselage, yawing it violently to the left. More forces from that direction tore off the vertical stabilizer, which came away with portions of the fuselage, already weakened from losing the left stabilizer. Further gyrations caused the left wing to disintegrate, opening its fuel tanks and leading to a flash fire. What was left of the fuselage crumbled, and the craft plunged to the ground. The cause of the accident was determined to be a loss of control of the plane in turbulence, resulting in an involuntary steep descent which created aerodynamic loads in excess of those for which the craft had been designed.

Although intended for both Royal Air Force and Royal Navy use, the aircraft never went into series production. Design and development The Queen Wasp was built to meet an Air Ministry Specification Q.32/35 for a pilotless target aircraft to replace the de Havilland Tiger Moth based de Havilland Queen Bee. Two prototypes were ordered in May 1936, one to have a wheeled landing gear for use by the Royal Air Force and the other as a floatplane for Royal Navy use for air-firing practice at sea. Powered by the Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah engine, a total of 65 aircraft were ordered, contingent on the success of the flight test programme. The aircraft was a single-engined biplane constructed of wood with sharply-tapered wings and fabric-covered control surfaces. An enclosed cabin with one seat was provided so the Queen Wasp could be flown manually with the radio control system turned off. The radio control system was complex with a number of backup safety devices to ensure radio and battery operation was uninterrupted. A trailing receiver aerial was winched out after takeoff and served as an automatic landing device which was activated when the trailing aerial weight hit the runway. The sensitivity of the system in turbulent weather meant that an alternative landing signal was used to initiate a landing procedure.\\"Airspeed AS.30 Queen Wasp\\" 1978, p. 40. The landplane first flew on 11 June 1937, and the floatplane on 19 October 1937. The floatplane was successfully catapulted from HMS Pegasus in November 1937. Operational history In flight tests, the aircraft was found to be underpowered and water handling difficulties necessitated a redesign of the floats by their manufacturer, Short Brothers. Although the production run of 10 aircraft was begun (P5441‚ÄìP5450), only three more aircraft were completed and delivered to the Royal Air Force. Airspeed proposed a number of unsuccessful designs derived from the Queen Wasp including the AS.38 communications aircraft and the AS.50 trainer developed to meet Specification T.24/40.

Daejongism ( Daejonggyo or Taejongkyo, \\"religion of the Divine Progenitor\\" or \\"great ancestral religion\\") or Dangunism ( Dangungyo or Tangunkyo, \\"religion of Dangun\\")Daejonggyo, national religion of Korea. Quote: ¬´A great scholar of the Silla Dynasty Choe Chi-weon (857-? A.D.), naturally wrote that Dangunism (Dae-jong-Gyo), a religious teaching indigenous to Korea, embraces the essential teachings of Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism.¬ª is the name of a number of religious movements within the framework of Korean shamanism, focused on the worship of Dangun (or Tangun). There are around seventeen of these groups, the main one of which was founded in Seoul in 1909 by Na Cheol (ÎÇòÏ≤†, 1864-1916).ÌïúÍµ≠Î∏åÎ¶¨ÌÉúÎãàÏª§ Ïò®ÎùºÏù∏ - ÎÇòÏ≤† Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online Korea 'Na Cheol' Dangunists believe their mythos to be the authentic Korean native religion, that was already around as Gosindo (Âè§Á•ûÈÅì, \\"way of the Ancestral God\\" or \\"ancient way of God\\") at the time of the first Mongol invasions of Korea, and that was revived as \\"Daejongism\\" (Daejonggyo) just at the start of the Japanese occupation.Lee Chi-ran, pp. 11-12 The religion was suppressed during the Japanese rule.Lee Chi-ran, p. 12 The religion believes in one God manifested in three persons,Baker (2007a), p. 464. whose earthly incarnation was the legendary king Dangun, who ruled over a Korean empire around 5000 years ago. Its main tenet is that the Koreans have their own God and they have no need to worship foreign gods. Its emphasis is on the national identity and unity of the Korean people (known as minjok) and as such has been associated with Korean nationalism (and sometimes ultranationalism). Daejongism does not focus so much on institutions or rituals but rather on central doctrines and associated mythologies, so that it is more definable as a creed or a faith system rather than an organized religion. In the decade of 1910-1920, it had its major growth, reaching an estimated following of 400,000.Lee Gyungwon, p. 54. Its popularity was largely due to its efforts on behalf of Korean independence. Once this aim was achieved, its membership declined, although Daejongism acquired a reputation for its educational and scholarly institutions, which published in particular monumental works about Korea's struggle for independence and Daejongism's contribution to it.Lee Gyungwon, p. 67. A 1995 census found that fewer than 10,000 Koreans claimed to follow the religion., although Korean census figures systematically underestimate the number of followers of new religions, who are often reluctant to indicate their religious affiliation. Teaching Central to the faith is the belief in Haneullim, the triad of Gods of Korean culture: the creator (Hanim/Hwanin), the teacher (Hanung/Hwanung) and the ruler (Dangun/Hanbaeg≈èm). Dangun, the leader of the Korean nation, is thought to be the third, and human, manifestation of Haneullim (\\"God of Heaven\\") or Haneul (\\"Heaven\\"). His physical mother was Ungnye (ÁÜäÂ•≥) a bear transformed into a woman.Lee Chi-ran, p. 13 After his earthly reign, Dangun ascended to Heaven. Semantically, Haneul connotes three Gods: God-Father as the creator of the universe, God-Teacher as the mentor of universal nature and God-King as ruler of creation.Lee Chi-ran, p. 14 The faith is embodied in three sacred texts. Believers claim that they date back to the time of Dangun, or even earlier, and this claim, although disputed by scholars, is also accepted by many Koreans who do not belong to Daejongism.Baker (2007a), p. 465. The three texts are the Ch'√≥nbugong (The Classic of the Seal of Heaven), a narrative of the origins of the world, the Samil sin'go (The Teachings of the Triune God), a theological statement, and the Ch'amj√≥ngy√≥ng (The Classic of the Wise One), a manual of ethics.Baker (2007a), p. 465. A number of scholars believe that these books were compiled in the first two decades of the 20th century, based on visions and revelation the founder of Daejongism, Na Cheol (1863-1916), claimed to have receivedLee Gyungwon, p. 39. Daejongism is also well known for its teaching of breathing techniques, known in the West as part of the so- called internal alchemy (Neidan in Taoism). Daejongism's techniques focus on the '\\"sea of energy,\\" which is also often referred to as the cinnabar field or the elixir field (tanj√≥n).The tanjon is a field rich in the vital energy Qi and the religion offers techniques to draw on this field and circulate the energy through the human body. These techniques became extremely popular in the 1970s and generated a new interest in Daejongism and its school of internal alchemy, known as Kich'√≥nmun.Baker (2007b), p. 508. Samsin Sinang Samsin Sinang is a Dangunist sect.Lee Chi-ran, p. 16 Its headquarters are in Pyeongchang County. The current leader is Bae Sun-moon, and the religion promotes the Korean reunification. History and influences Na Cheol, the founder of the religion. Na Cheol, known for his role as a leader of the Korean independence movement from Japanese rule, founded the religion in 1909 as its \\"great teacher\\" (tosagyo) and named it first \\"Dangunism\\" (Dangungyo, Dangun religion) and then a year later \\"Daejongism\\" (Daejonggyo). He said that it was a revival of Goshindo (Âè§Á•ûÈÅì, \\"way of the Ancestral God\\"), the belief in the trinitarian god that was worshipped in ancient Korea. Some scholars have suggested the affinity to Christianity, though the ethical basis of the religion is similar to Confucianism. Others believe that early Dajeongism tried to counter the growing influence of Christianity by replacing the Christian Trinity with a Korean one. In fact, criticism of Christianity has continued in Daejongism. In 1994, Han Ch‚Äôangb√¥m presented the Daejongism ‚Äúcase against Christianity,‚Äù claiming that the God of the Bible was ‚Äújealous and violent‚Äù and thus inherently ‚Äúimmoral.‚Äù The text also accused Christians of having been collaborators with the Japanese during the occupation.Kevin A. Cawley, Religious and Philosophical Traditions of Korea, London and New York: Routledge 2019, 135‚Äì136. The importance of Dangun was influenced by Shin Chaeho's A New Reading of History, and Dangun was emphasised over another legendary figure, Jizi (Kija), who was said to not be Korean in origin. Na claimed that the Goshindo religion was approximately 4300 years of age, which would make it Korea's oldest religion. After the annexation of Korea in 1910 by the Empire of Japan, the new religion was spread in Manchuria by Na, where it set up schools and social centers, and became a focus of the Korean independence movement. Na committed suicide at a shrine on Mount Kuw≈èl in 1916, saying that he had guilt over his failures and was martyring himself for the sake of his religion, God and people. Leaders of the religion after Na include his successor Kim Kyohong, and An Ho-Sang. The teachings of Dangun were said by Kim in his \\"History of the Divine Dangun's People\\" to be the sin gyo or \\"divine teaching\\", and he said that various Korean religions, such as that of Wang Kon, were continuations of the sin gyo, but that these beliefs had been suppressed under the Mongols, Buddhism, and Confucianism. The main task of the religion was chunggwang (\\"lighting anew\\"), meaning reviving the memory of Dangun. A particularly controversial issue concerns the roots in Daejongism of the global physical exercise and spirituality system known as Body & Brain, Dahnhak, or Dahn Yoga, founded by Korean master of martial arts and author Ilchi Lee. While \\"Body and Brain\\" does not normally emphasize its connection with Daejongism, scholars see it as one of many schools teaching a form of internal alchemy based on the techniques Daejongism popularized. According to American scholar of Korean religion Don Baker, \\"not only-did Dahn claim that its techniques were the same practices that T√†n'gun [Dangun] taught when he ruled over the first Korean kingdom; it also heralded the three T√†n'gun-era sacred texts of Taejonggyo [Daejongism] as authentic scripture.\\" Only when the movement became international, references to Dangun and Daejongism were downplayed, although the Daejongism symbol was embroidered on the original uniforms given to Dahnhak students in America and the organization \\"erected a large outdoor statue of Tan'gun near [its] Sedona [Arizona] headquarters.\\" Baker states that references to Daejongism, although not made explicit, remain easy to detect for those familiar with the Korean religion.Baker (2007b), p. 509.

It is Aarne-Thompson-Uther index ATU 552, \\"The Girls who married animals\\". At the end of the tale, the prince's brothers-in-law help him in defeating the dragon (or sorcerer, or ogre). Synopsis The king of Green Bank had three beautiful daughters. The king of Fair Meadows had three sons, who had been transformed into a falcon, a stag, and a dolphin; these sons loved the three daughters, but the king would not marry them to animals. The sons summoned all the animals of their kind and made war until the king yielded. They were married, and the queen gave each of her daughters a ring so they could recognize one another. After the wedding, the queen gave birth to a son, Tittone. One day, she lamented that she never heard what happened to her daughters. Tittone set out to find them. He found the eldest with the falcon husband; she hid him and persuaded her husband to let him visit. He stayed for a time, and the falcon gave him a feather when he set out to find the other sisters. After a time, he found the second sister, and her husband the stag made him welcome, and when he left, gave him some of its hair. He found the third sister, and her husband the dolphin made him welcome and gave him some scales when he left. Returning, he found a maiden captive in a tower, where a dragon slept, and which was surrounded by a lake. She begged him to save her. He threw down the feather, hairs, and scales, and his brothers-in-law appeared. The falcon summoned griffins to carry her to freedom; when the dragon woke, the stag summoned lions, bears, and other animals to tear it to pieces; the dolphin had waves engulf the tower to destroy it. This freed the brothers-in-law from their enchanted shapes, and they returned with their brides to their own parents, and Tittone returned to his with his bride. Analysis The tale was translated into English language as King Falcon, King Dolphin, and King Stag and published in The Italian Fairy Book.Macdonell, Anne. The Italian fairy book. London: Unwin. 1911. pp. 70-77. Another translation of the tale was given as The Three Brother Beasts, in The Golden Fairy Book.Millar, H. R. The Golden Fairy Book. London: Hutchinson & Co.. 1894. pp. 137-150. There are variants where the girls' father is the one that gives away the daughters to the animals, and their brother, born years later, goes after them. In other variants, the princesses and the prince are born in the same generation, and it is the brother who weds his sisters to the animals. The second variation lies in the brothers-in-law: usually, there are three animals, one terrestrial, a second aerial and the third aquatic,Baudis, Josef. Czech folk tales. London: Allen & Unwin. [1917.] pp. 98-103. as in Mus√§us's version (respectively, a bear, a falcon and a giant fish). In the famous Russian version Marya Morevna, the husbands-to-be are a falcon, an eagle and a raven. In Czech fairy tale film The Prince and the Evening Star, the prince marries his sisters to the Sun, the Moon and the Wind, who are princes or kings, as per the original tale by author Bozena Nemcova.\\"Sonnenk√∂nig, Mondk√∂nig, Windk√∂nig\\". In: Waldau, Alfred. B√∂hmisches M√§rchenbuch. Prag: Drug und Verlag von Rath. Serzabeth. 1860. pp. 440-457. W. R. Halliday attempted a reconstruction of the supposedly original form of the tale, dubbed \\"The Magic Brothers-in-law\\", which incorporates the marriage to animals or other creatures, and the fight against an adversary whose soul is located outside his body (\\"Ogre's life in an egg\\").Dawkins, Richard McGillivray.

Detroit: Wayne State University Press. 1966. p. 438. Russian folklorist Alexander Afanasyev, based on comparative analysis of Slavic folkloric traditions, stated that the eagle, the falcon and the raven (or crow) are connected to weather phenomena, like storm, rain, wind. He also saw a parallel between the avian suitors from the tale Marya Morevna with the suitors from other Slavic folktales, where they are the Sun, the Moon, the Thunder and the Wind.–ê—Ñ–∞–Ω–∞—Å—å–µ–≤, –ê.–ù. –ü–æ—ç—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ–∑–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥—É: –û–ø—ã—Ç —Å—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏ –≤–µ—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å –º–∏—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö —Ä–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤. –¢–æ–º 1.

(In Russian) Eastern Europe In The Story of Argilius and the Flame-King, the King and Queen wish to marry their three daughters to their only brother, to keep the kingdom intact.

It was also released as Genuine: A Tale of a Vampire. Director Wiene created Genuine as a follow-up to his massively successful 1919 film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, using the same writer and cinematographer who had worked on the earlier film.

The complete film is available on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opDF7s5Vblk Plot A scene from the film Since completing a portrait of Genuine, a high priestess, Percy becomes irritable and withdrawn. He loses interest in painting and refuses to see his friends, preferring to spend his time alone with the portrait in his study. After turning down a wealthy patron's offer to buy the picture, Percy falls asleep while reading stories of Genuine's life. Genuine comes to life from the painting and escapes. Genuine is purchased at a slave market by an old eccentric named Lord Melo. He learns that she had been sold into slavery when her people were conquered by a rival tribe. Melo locks her in an opulent chamber beneath his house, though she begs to be set free. Guyard the barber visits Lord Melo every day at noon, though today he sends his young nephew Florian in his place. Meanwhile, Genuine breaks out of her underground prison, climbs the immense staircase to find Florian shaving the sleeping Lord Melo. She bewitches him into slitting Melo's throat with a straight razor. Florian falls under Genuine's spell, but when she demands that he prove his love for her by taking his own life, he cannot go through with it and is forced to make his escape. Melo's grandson Percy arrives at the house. He too becomes infatuated with Genuine, quickly forgetting any questions he has about his grandfather's sudden death. Although Genuine loves Percy in return, their romance is destined to be short-lived. Guyard, stirred up by Florian's tales of murder and witchcraft, arms a mob with scythes and bludgeons and storms Melo's house. Florian, still infatuated with Genuine, secretly makes his own way inside, determined that he shall have her, or no one will.

A black-and-white transfer of the same abridgement was released on DVD by Alpha Video in 2015, supplemented by the 1928 American short film The Fall of the House of Usher.

A layered hidden Markov model (LHMM) consists of N levels of HMMs, where the HMMs on level i + 1 correspond to observation symbols or probability generators at level i. Every level i of the LHMM consists of Ki HMMs running in parallel.N. Oliver, A. Garg and E. Horvitz, \\"Layered Representations for Learning and Inferring Office Activity from Multiple Sensory Channels\\", Computer Vision and Image Understanding, vol. 96, p. 163-180, 2004.  Background  LHMMs are sometimes useful in specific structures because they can facilitate learning and generalization. For example, even though a fully connected HMM could always be used if enough training data were available, it is often useful to constrain the model by not allowing arbitrary state transitions. In the same way it can be beneficial to embed the HMM in a layered structure which, theoretically, may not be able to solve any problems the basic HMM cannot, but can solve some problems more efficiently because less training data is needed.  The layered hidden Markov model  A layered hidden Markov model (LHMM) consists of N levels of HMMs where the HMMs on level N+1 corresponds to observation symbols or probability generators at level N. Every level i of the LHMM consists of K_i HMMs running in parallel. A layered hidden Markov model At any given level L in the LHMM a sequence of T_L observation symbols \\\\mathbf{o}_L=\\\\\\\\{o_1, o_2, \\\\dots, o_{T_L}\\\\\\\\} can be used to classify the input into one of K_L classes, where each class corresponds to each of the K_L HMMs at level L. This classification can then be used to generate a new observation for the level L-1 HMMs. At the lowest layer, i.e. level N, primitive observation symbols \\\\mathbf{o}_p=\\\\\\\\{o_1, o_2, \\\\dots, o_{T_p}\\\\\\\\} would be generated directly from observations of the modeled process. For example, in a trajectory tracking task the primitive observation symbols would originate from the quantized sensor values. Thus at each layer in the LHMM the observations originate from the classification of the underlying layer, except for the lowest layer where the observation symbols originate from measurements of the observed process. It is not necessary to run all levels at the same time granularity. For example, it is possible to use windowing at any level in the structure so that the classification takes the average of several classifications into consideration before passing the results up the layers of the LHMM.D. Aarno and D. Kragic \\"Evaluation of Layered HMM for Motion Intention Recognition\\", IEEE International Conference on Advanced Robotics, 2007 Instead of simply using the winning HMM at level L+1 as an input symbol for the HMM at level L it is possible to use it as a probability generator by passing the complete probability distribution up the layers of the LHMM. Thus instead of having a \\"winner takes all\\" strategy where the most probable HMM is selected as an observation symbol, the likelihood L(i) of observing the ith HMM can be used in the recursion formula of the level L HMM to account for the uncertainty in the classification of the HMMs at level L+1. Thus, if the classification of the HMMs at level n+1 is uncertain, it is possible to pay more attention to the a-priori information encoded in the HMM at level L. A LHMM could in practice be transformed into a single layered HMM where all the different models are concatenated together.D. Aarno and D. Kragic: \\"Layered HMM for Motion Intention Recognition\\", IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2006. Some of the advantages that may be expected from using the LHMM over a large single layer HMM is that the LHMM is less likely to suffer from overfitting since the individual sub-components are trained independently on smaller amounts of data. A consequence of this is that a significantly smaller amount of training data is required for the LHMM to achieve a performance comparable of the HMM. Another advantage is that the layers at the bottom of the LHMM, which are more sensitive to changes in the environment such as the type of sensors, sampling rate etc. can be retrained separately without altering the higher layers of the LHMM.

Initially it was part of the medieval Duchy of St. Sava (), established by duke (, ) Stefan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça within the Kingdom of Bosnia. After the Ottoman conquest, it was part of the Sanjak of Herzegovina. Between 1580 and 1833, Sanjak of Herzegovina was part of the Bosnia Eyalet, and then became a separate Herzegovina Eyalet (1833‚Äì1851), of the Ottoman Empire. The major (western and central) part of historical Herzegovina was occupied by Austria- Hungary in 1878, after the Congress of Berlin, and that region became part of the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since then, the name of Herzegovina was reduced to that region. In the same time, eastern portion of historical Herzegovina was annexed to the Principality of Montenegro (1878), while some sections remained under Ottoman rule (Sanjak of Pljevlja) until 1912, when they were divided between Montenegro and Serbia. All of those regions of historical Herzegovina, detached from it since 1878, became known as the Old Herzegovina.

Biography He was born in Albania, Fier, where he finished high school and continued his education in the University of Tirana, majoring in the English Language. He has worked as a high school teacher, a literature theory researcher, editor of books for children and a scriptwriter. He has also translated several books from English. His main vocation has been fiction for children. His books in this genre include: Aventurat e Kok√´kasht√´s (Strawhead‚Äôs Adventures) and Kok√´kashta n√´ Ishullin e Gurt√´ (Strawhead in the Stony Island), for which he was awarded the Silver Quill 2003, the novel Aventurat e Qerosit dhe Eramlit (The Adventures of Baldpate and Eramli), and several collections of stories, fairy-tales, and screenplays for animated films. With the fall of the Communist dictatorship Pone has mostly been engaged mostly in translation, but has also written two novels: Nuk Ishte Vet√´m √ãnd√´rr, (It Wasn‚Äôt Merely a Dream, 1995) and Lot√´t e Tr√´ndafilit (Rose‚Äôs Tears, 2005, 2006).Stavri Pone's Personal Webpage Works Nuk Ishte Vet√´m √ãnd√´rr (It Wasn't Merely a Dream) deals with a series of events involving some high-school students during the dictatorship era by providing, through a pleasing narration, interesting pictures of real life by stressing the lack of liberties among people, especially the young. Lot√´t e Tr√´ndafilit (Rose's Tears) develops the same theme, but much more broadly and deeply. It opens with two significant quotations, one from Sigmund Freud, The liberty of the individual is no gift of civilization. It was greatest before there was any civilization, and one by Hannah Arendt, Love, by its very nature, is unworldly, and it is for this reason rather than its rarity that it is not only apolitical but antipolitical, perhaps the most powerful of all antipolitical human forces. The novel encompasses a large-scale panorama, centering on the oppression of free thinking and involves wicked and conspiratorial plots against a young intellectual which results in his arrest and conviction to 12 years‚Äô imprisonment for what he writes in secrecy against the dictatorship. Under some extraordinary circumstances he commits a crime by killing an inmate, and after having been squeezed severely under tons of massive mineral chops in the underground gallery where he works like a slave, he goes insane, with moments of clarity and turbulence, and when he is clear, he shows a keen sense of realism and a high potential for in-depth analysis. In prison and after the release from it, he continues to write essays of a liberal democratic spirit. Literary themes Love theme takes an important place, too, which the author depicts with fine and lyrical brushes by rendering the novel a touch of romance and beauty, employing felicitous expressions and imagery, stressing the stream of consciousness and carving a statue of love with masterful chiseling in its diverse comprehensiveness ‚Äì emotional, physical and dramatic. This line includes a number of the protagonist's love stories, but the sole and the greatest love of his whole life is that for a confinement-sentenced young girl, which ends tragically. Being a multidimensional work, the novel includes a whole array of characters, relationships, conflicts and encounters which have been given through non- chronological lines. The style of writing is graceful, figurative, at times poetic, at times philosophical, and at times contemplative while featuring a sincere confession of the protagonist and thereby catching hold of the reader's interest up to the end. From start to end the novel is a colorful mosaic with film-like depictions and scenes, all of which breathtakingly portrayed, a work wholly dedicated to the dignity and the rights of the individual, freedom and love, which are trampled upon in a dictatorship. Other works include the novels: Good Morning, Dear (2006); Bora (2007); The Enemy of the State (2008); The Color of Passion (2009); Miramare Hotel (2009); Beyond the Dream (2010); Star in the Horizon (2011).

As his name implies, Super Duck (nicknamed \\"Supe\\") was originally a parody of Superman, even down to a red and blue costume. But his time as a superhero was short, and by late 1944 his stories became more conventional, in the Disney/Carl Barks mode. Super Duck Comics ran from 1944‚Äì1960, featuring \\"Super Duck, the Cockeyed Wonder\\" in his most familiar attire: a black shirt, red lederhosen and often an Alpine hat. Regular contributors to Super Duck Comics included creator Al Fagaly, as well as Red Holmdale. Fagaly illustrated most covers up through the early 1950s.  Publication history  Super Duck's first appearance came in Jolly Jingles #10 (Summer 1943). He soon switched to a green and red suit, presumably to avoid legal action by Superman's publisher (National Periodicals), but his time as a superhero was short, and by Jolly Jingles #16 (the last issue) his stories became more conventional. Super Duck Comics' first issue was cover-dated Fall 1944; it ended its run at 94 issues in 1960. The character's escapades would be reprinted in Archie Comics' digest series Jughead Jones (at least as late as 1979), Laugh Comics Digest, and Archie's Mad House. More recently (2013 onward), his stories have often been reprinted in the digests again. The Super Duck character himself has also returned in modern times, most typically presented as a fictional comic book superhero within Archie's world. Various magic-themed stories have made this Super Duck temporarily \\"real\\" to have adventures with Archie and others.

When Faunt sees that he's all wet and tells him so, Supe takes Faunt's book on Jonah and says, \\"Faunt, I'm all wet about a lot of things.\\"Reprinted in Laugh Comics Digest #13 (Archie Comics, Nov. 1977). * \\"The Nifty Thrifty Trip\\" ‚Äî Supe and Faunt go camping in the country to save money, but Supe ‚Äî against Faunt's advice ‚Äî tries to steal apples and milk from farmers, and camps on private property.

He served as the 13th Governor of Iowa from 1886 until 1890. Early life Larrabee was born in Ledyard, Connecticut, into a family of French Huguenot extraction. His father, Adam Larrabee (1787‚Äì1869), was a West Point graduate and an accomplished soldier, who served with distinction in the War of 1812. His mother was Hannah (n√©e Lester). Larrabee was the seventh of nine children, and grew up on his father's Connecticut farm. He was educated in local schools until the age of 19. At around age 15 Larrabee lost the eyesight in his right eye after a gun he was holding accidentally discharged. As a result, he was unfit for many careers available to young men of his class in New England. Larrabee chose to become a teacher. In 1853, at age 21, he moved to Iowa following an older sister in search of opportunity. In Iowa, Larrabee taught school for a few years, but soon after his arrival established himself as a successful miller, banker, and farmer in Clermont. He attempted to enlist at the outbreak of the Civil War, but was rejected on account of his disability. Larrabee prospered in business and eventually became of one of the biggest landowners in the state. Political career William Larrabee frequently chose to be portrayed in profile with the left side of his face showing because of the disfigurement to the right side Larrabee entered politics in 1867, having bypassed local politics. He was elected to the Iowa Senate as a Republican, after helping organize the newly created party in Iowa. Larrabee was reelected many times, sometimes without even nominal Democratic opposition. While a legislator, Larrabee served on several committees, and eventually came to chair the influential Ways and Means committee. He was elected as governor in 1885, succeeding Buren R. Sherman, and served two 2-year terms, from January 14, 1886, until February 27, 1890. The byline of his first campaign was \\"a schoolhouse on every hill and no saloons in the valley.\\" In the general election he faced Democrat Charles Whiting, who attempted to portray Larrabee as an unredeemed capitalist and owners of many locals' debts. The election was relatively close, but Larrabee won with 175,504 votes to Whiting's 168,502. After serving two terms as governor, Larrabee retired to Montauk, his family mansion in Clermont. He served in several minor public roles after retiring. At the end of his life he supported Theodore Roosevelt and the Bull Moose faction of the Republican party. Anna M. Larrabee Personal life Larrabee married Anna Matilda Appleman on September 12, 1861. The Larrabees had seven children: Charles, Augusta, Julia, Anna, William Jr., Frederic and Helen. Julia married Don Lathrop Love, future Republican mayor of Lincoln, Nebraska. Larrabee had a large library and was fond of reading. He also experimented with fruit growing and liked to travel, at one point spending several months in Europe and Palestine in 1873. He and Anna employed French student Mathilde Laigle as a governess from 1895 to 1903. She was their daughter's companion and teacher and she would spend whole days with them when the only language to be spoken was French. Larrabee was a Methodist. Larrabee died on November 16, 1912, and was buried at God's Acre Cemetery in Clermont alongside his wife.

It is used as a biomarker to measure the rate of bone turnover. NTX can be measured in the urine (uNTX) or serum (serum NTX). Usefulness of NTX as a biomarker Evaluating an individual's rate of bone turnover, termed bone remodeling, directly may be important in assessing his or her potential nonsurgical treatment response as well as evaluating his or her risk of developing complications during healing following surgical intervention. To determine an individual's rate of bone turnover, numerous biomarkers are available in the body fluids that can be correlated to this rate, and one such biomarker is NTX. However, while NTX does fluctuate in a very sensitive manner in line with bone resorption patterns, they are not very specific, in that they may vary spontaneously without physiologic intervention. For example, NTX levels may drop by 50% from day to day with no treatment, thus, making NTX levels unconvincing evidence of treatment effect. Conversely, the serum CTX biomarker, described in 2000 by Rosen, appears to be a much more effective and valuable indicator of bone resorption rate.

It was released a single, and became a top 20 Irish hit. Content The song tells the story of a little boy who on the first day of school started drawing pictures of flowers using many different colors. The teacher (sung by Chapin in a falsetto voice) is angry, so she tells him that he should not be coloring because it is not time for art, and in any case, the boy is coloring the flowers all wrong and that he should paint them red and green, \\"the way they always have been seen.\\" The boy disagrees and continues to color them from his imagination until the teacher punishes him by standing him in a corner. Finally, the now terrified little boy gives in and tells the teacher that \\"flowers are red, and green leaves are green.\\" Years later, the little boy moves towns and attends a different school, a new teacher encourages her students to use all sorts of colors, only to find the student only coloring his flowers red and green; when the new teacher asks the boy why, he meekly responds by quoting his previous teacher‚Äî\\"flowers are red, and green leaves are green.\\" In the live concert versions, Chapin extended the song's ending to: \\"There still must be a way to have our children say...\\" before featuring the little boy's chorus again and bringing the song to a better conclusion. A version of this is featured on his 1979 live album Legends of the Lost and Found. Origin The idea for the song came to Chapin when his secretary told him about her son who brought his report card home from school one day. The teacher had written a note in the card saying: \\"Your son is marching to the beat of a different drummer, but don't worry we will soon have him joining the parade by the end of the term.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qrbNygL0YU The quote was often used as an introduction to the song during live performances, with the comma after \\"drummer\\" being pronounced as a word because of the educational theme.

A pig roast is a traditional meal in the Balkan states of Serbia and Montenegro, and it can often be found on the menu of traditional taverns and bars: kafana. In Southeast Asia, a pig roast is a staple among the Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian communities, notably among Catholic Filipinos and Hindu Balinese people, or Buddhist Chinese people. Traditions  Balinese Babi guling or roasted suckling pig The tradition of the hog roast goes back millennia and is found in many cultures. There are numerous ways to roast pork, including open fire rotisserie style roasting, and \\"caja china\\" style box grilling. Many families traditionally have a pig roast for Thanksgiving or Christmas. In Miami and other areas with large Cuban, Puerto Rican, Honduran or other Caribbean populations pig roasts are often held on Christmas Eve by families and friends,Cuban Christmas TraditionsIn Miami, Christmas Eve Means Roast Pig whereas families from Hawaii often hold a roast on Memorial Day. =Brazil= In Brazil, pig roast tradition is called leitoa a pururuca.:pt:Pururuca Roast pig is called porco no rolete (lit. pig on the roller). =China= In various Chinese communities (especially in Southern China), a roast suckling pig is purchased for special family occasions, business launches, or as a ritualistic spiritual offering. For example, one tradition is to offer one or several whole roast suckling pigs to the Jade Emperor to celebrate a Chinese film's opening. The pig is sacrificed to ward off evils and in prayer for the film's success. One garnish used to make the dish look more appealing is a circular slice of pineapple and cherry, and is often placed in a red box for luck. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, roast pig is called babi guling, babi putar, babi panggang or babi bakar; it is predominantly found in non-Muslim majority regions, such as Hindu Bali and Christian Batak lands in North Sumatra, the Minahasa people of North Sulawesi, Toraja in South Sulawesi, Papua, and also among Chinese Indonesians. In Bali, babi guling is usually served with lawar and steamed rice; it is a popular dish in Balinese restaurants and warungs. In the Batak people's tradition, babi guling is a prerequisite in wedding offerings by the bride's family. In Papua, pigs and yams are roasted in heated stones placed in a hole dug in the ground and covered with leaves; this cooking method is called bakar batu (burning the stone), and it is an important cultural and social event among Papuan people.Bakar Batu Papua (in Indonesian) =Philippines= Similarly in the Philippines, also a former Spanish colony, as well as Overseas Filipino communities, the roasted pig is also the national and main cultural dish and has the same culinary significance as in Puerto Rico and expat communities. It is referred to as lechon baboy or litson baboy. It is one of the main highlights at Christmas celebrations, birthday parties, weddings, debuts, and family reunions.Menu: Lechon Baboy (Roast Pig) =Puerto Rico= Pig roast (lechon asado) is very popular in many former Spanish colonies; it is a part of Puerto Rico's national dish and is usually served with arroz con gandules. In Puerto Rico, pig roasts occur year-round, but are most common at New Year's Eve and especially Christmas; occasionally if a family has moved to the United States, they will take the recipe with them and use it during the summer.Party With Pig: In Puerto Rico, a Glorious Feast In the Dominican Republic, puerco a la puya is a traditional part of the Christmas Eve meal. In Spain, the locals call this a suckling pig or a lechon asado. Hog roasts are becoming more popular across Spain and more so in Southern Spain due to the ex-pat community, as well as some of Spain's former colonies. =UK= In the UK, the tradition of pig roasting, more commonly known in the UK as a \\"hog roast\\", is popular on many occasions, particularly parties and celebrations. It is usually an outdoor event, and a staple meal at many show events. The tradition is to roast either on a spit, turning the pig under a flame, or in a large oven in a roasting pan; roasting pigs around 130 lbs (60 kg) in weight are common in the UK. The pig is normally roasted in a propane gas machine. The pig's skin is scored with a sharp blade and covered in water and salt to make the crackling. In ancient times, going all the way back to the Saxons, roasting a wild boar was often the centerpiece of a meal at Yuletide, with Yule being Freya's feast. The head was often the greatest delicacy, as evidenced by the survival of the Boar's Head Carol. =United States= An 1887 depiction of Southern style pig roasting. The practice is not much different from present day methods. In the United States, roasting a whole pig or a feral hog has been a tradition for over two hundred years, especially in the Southern United States where it is closely linked to barbecue. From Virginia south to Florida Panhandle. and west to the Mississippi River south to Louisiana, the favored meat in Southern, Cajun, Appalachian, and Creole cooking is pork and has been since colonial times: pigs did not require any special handling or maintenance and could be sent off into the woods and rounded up again when supplies ran low, and thus were the prime choice for meat for small farmers and plantation owners, and for men living up in the mountains, the tradition was to drive their pigs to market every fall, fattening them up on the many nuts and acorns that proliferated in the area. George Washington even mentions attending a barbecue in his journal on August 4, 1769, and the records of Mount Vernon note a smokehouse on the premises. Like many plantation owners, he raised several pigs for slaughter in November and once his slaves had finished curing the meat into ham and bacon, they would pit roast some whole pigs over hot coals as a treat.

The styles of grills used are as varied as the methods of producing them; some are homemade while others are custom made. In a Hawaii-style pig roast, a large pit is typically dug into the ground and lined with banana leaves, as lava rocks are heated over an open flame until they are very hot. The heated rocks are placed into the pit, and a seasoned pig is placed inside and covered with additional banana leaves, which serve as insulation and for flavor. In an American Cuban-style pig roast, the \\"caja china\\" is the most commercially popular method by which to roast a whole pig. In its more traditional form, a roasting box is commonly fashioned above ground out of concrete blocks and steel mesh.The Best Way to Roast a Pig Another popular method is to use a pig roasting box, the oldest and best known brand of which is \\"La Caja China.\\"The La Caja China Box, In Cake and Real-Life Form The cooking process is communal and usually done by men; the host is helped by friends or family. It usually takes four to eight hours to cook the pig completely; the pig is often started \\"meat-side\\" down, and then is flipped one time once the hog has stopped dripping rendered fat. When the cooking is complete, the meat should ideally be tender to the point of falling off of the bone. The meat is then either chopped or pulled or is picked off the roasted pig by the guests. In the Philippines, the pig is typically stuffed with spices, placed on a bamboo spit, and roasted over hot coals.BBQ ‚Äì Philippine Style In Puerto Rico, pig roast is prepared in adobo mojado (wet seasoning) containing crushed garlic, black pepper, salt, or√©gano brujo, olive oil, and wine vinegar.

He was the Thomaskantor, cantor of the Thomanerchor in Leipzig and director of the towns's church music, from 1657 to 1676.Grove Concise Dictionary of Music (¬© 1994 by Oxford University Press); Grove Music Online (Author: George J. Buelow, ¬© Oxford University Press 2005) Life Most of the biographical information about Kn√ºpfer comes from a published obituary. He was born in Asch (now A≈°, Czech Republic), and was first taught music by his father, a Kantor and organist. He also studied regularly with an unidentified tutor living near Asch, from whom he gained a solid grounding in, and lasting love for, a number of scholastic disciplines. At the age of 13 he entered the Gymnasium Poeticum at Regensburg and remained there for eight years. During this unusually long period he became well versed in the city's musical traditions (such as the works of Andreas Raselius), studied the organ, perhaps with Augustin Gradenthaler, and mastered a number of humanistic subjects, especially the poetic arts and philology. His gifts as a student were supported by scholarships from the city of Regensburg, and he was commended by influential members of the staff of the Gymnasium and the city council, some of the latter providing him with favourable testimonials when he moved to Leipzig in 1654. It is not known why he went there, but in view of his lifelong desire to improve his mind, it was possibly because he planned to enter the university. He did not, however, do so. During his first few years in Leipzig, Kn√ºpfer gave music lessons and sang as a bass in church choirs, displaying enough talent to take solo parts. He applied for the post of Thomaskantor when Tobias Michael died on 26 June 1657, and he was appointed on 17 July; the four other candidates to whom he was preferred included Adam Krieger. In Kn√ºpfer the Thomaskirche found a Kantor and the city of Leipzig a director of music who came close to the musical and intellectual calibre of Sethus Calvisius and Johann Hermann Schein, his two predecessors. During his 19-year tenure Leipzig once again became the leading musical city in central Germany following the sharp decline resulting from the Thirty Years War, the long Swedish occupation of the city and his protracted illness. Kn√ºpfer thus initiated a final period of musical excellence in Leipzig that culminated in the careers of his three successors, Johann Schelle, Johann Kuhnau and Johann Sebastian Bach. Although never a student at the university, he continued the study of philosophy and philology with members of the faculty and was thought of as a member of the academic community. He was praised for his command of classical sources concerning music, which he mastered from Meibom‚Äôs editions published in 1652; he studied the treatises of, among others, Guido of Arezzo, Boethius, Berno of Reichenau and Athanasius Kircher. In addition to his productive career as Kantor he is known to have travelled to Halle to direct his own music for the dedication of new organs, for the Marktkirche on 15 February 1664 and the Ulrichskirche on 16 November 1675; also he directed a programme of music for the centenary of the Halle Gymnasium on 17 August 1665. His circle of musical colleagues included many men important in 17th-century German music, such as Johann Christoph Pezel, Johann Rosenm√ºller and Johann Kaspar Horn, and he may well have known Heinrich Sch√ºtz. He died in Leipzig, Germany. That he was regarded as one of Leipzig‚Äôs leading intellectual figures is indicated by the unusual honour of his being accorded an academic funeral at the university even though he had never been officially connected with it. Works Kn√ºpfer‚Äôs output consisted almost entirely of sacred works to Latin or German texts. Many are lost, and of those that survive few have been published in modern editions. Most are in the traditional style and form of the 17th-century vocal concerto, incorporating many of the characteristics of similar works by Heinrich Sch√ºtz - though with no traces of the latter's uniquely personal style. Large choral forms are enhanced by an orchestra of substantial size (most commonly two violins, three violas, bassoon with continuo, clarinos, trombone and timpani), which supports the choral parts as well as interjecting all manner of colourful concerted effects. The choral writing may be massively chordal or intricately polyphonic, and there are a number of much simpler concerted passages for soloists supported only by the continuo. Kn√ºpfer frequently based his German works on the text and melody of a chorale, and he was a master at deriving contrapuntal ideas from motivic fragmentation of the chorale. In many of these works the chorale verses are treated much as they are in slightly later German cantatas in which each verse is set separately. An opening choral movement, usually of large proportions and often repeated at the end of the work, is succeeded by movements designed for soloists. These are often ariosos or include fugal writing in which the chorale melody is passed back and forth between the voices in a duet or trio texture - a technique akin to that found in Bach‚Äôs organ chorale preludes. Other movements display dramatic use of expressive recitative: there is a good example in Wer ist, der so von Edom kŸêommt (excerpt in Schering, 1926, p. 162). Kn√ºpfer‚Äôs music is primarily serious and profoundly devout, though he did publish a collection of the secular madrigals and canzonettas (1663) that he wrote for the university student with whom he worked in the collegium musicum at Leipzig. His contrapuntal mastery, the powerful drama of his thematic ideas, his brilliant instrumentation and the variety of his vocal scoring all contribute to the impression of him as a worthy predecessor of Bach, many of whose Leipzig church cantatas belong to a tradition first developed by Kn√ºpfer.

The band's main line-up consisted of David Grubbs on guitar, Clark Johnson on bass guitar, and John McEntire on drums. The band also experimented with use of piano, organ and musique concr√®te compositions, foreshadowing McEntire's and Grubbs' subsequent musical projects. History Bastro was formed by Louisville, Kentucky guitarist David Grubbs after his former band Squirrel Bait folded in 1987. Grubbs had moved to Washington, D.C. to attend Georgetown University where he started an early version of Bastro with bassist Dan Treado, who soon left. Grubbs' hometown friend Clark Johnson, who'd played bass in Squirrel Bait, joined Grubbs, and the duo recorded the six-song EP Rode Hard & Put Up Wet, backed by a drum machine and engineered by Steve Albini for Homestead Records in 1988. After their first release, Bastro toured with the band My Dad Is Dead, whose drummer at the time was Oberlin College percussion major John McEntire. McEntire soon joined Bastro, replacing the drum machine, and the trio recorded a full-length album with former Squirrel Bait engineer Howie Gano. Two songs from this session were released as a single in 1989 and a test pressing of the album was made, but then scrapped when the band came back from their first European tour and decided they could do better. Returning to the studio with engineer Brian Paulson, they recorded faster versions of their songs and these‚Äîalong with \\"Shoot Me a Deer\\" and \\"Wurlitzer\\" from the first session‚Äîcomprised the band's first LP Diablo Guapo (Spanish for \\"Handsome Devil\\"). The album's 12 tracks clock in at 28 minutes, and include a cover of Phil Ochs' \\"Pretty Smart On My Part\\" as a follow-up to Squirrel Bait's own Ochs tribute on their album, Skag Heaven. In addition to presenting Bastro as a noise rock power trio playing in constantly shifting time signatures, Grubbs also plays piano on one track, mixed in with guitar feedback, tape music and spoken word, and the album's title track \\"Guapo\\" features a discordant horn section. During this period Johnson was enrolled at Northwestern University in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, and Grubbs also played in the band Bitch Magnet, resulting in a two year break before Bastro's second album, Sing the Troubled Beast. The band's instrumentation became more diverse, including more piano, organ, and an excursion into musique concr√®te on the song \\"The Sifter\\". Grubbs' lyrics also grew more obtuse. Johnson subsequently left the group to attend law school and was replaced on bass by Bundy K. Brown. Bastro toured and recorded a single with the group Codeine and began writing new, mostly instrumental material, some of which would later be released as a live album. Grubbs relocated to attend graduate school at the University of Chicago and the group known as Bastro evolved into Grubbs' next project, Gastr del Sol, with Brown and McEntire joining him for that project's debut album, The Serpentine Similar.

The jig is easily transported due to its small size and light weight. Precise measurements are required to layout the diagonal locations. This jig uses a zero reference line from which the rise and tread are measured. The upper part of the jig is a right triangle with a roundover overhang. The template allows for a tight fit of the tread into the stringer in the overhang section. The bottom of the jig incorporates an acute angle. This tapered angle allows a space for a wedge to fit against the back side of the vertical and the horizontal plane of the stringer. This jig can be used to lay out different rise (vertical) and tread (horizontal) widths. The jig is used with a plunge router and a bushing guide. The router plows out a precise groove into the finished product that allows all the parts to fit together. Uses of jig The jig is used to make finish stringers, in interior staircase fabrication. The stringer is also referred to as a skirtboard. It can be used in a closed staircase or an open staircase where one side of the staircase is exposed and the other is housed into the skirtboard.

Its mission is to ensure the future of elk, other wildlife, their habitat and American hunting heritage. In support of this mission the RMEF is committed to: # Conserving, restoring, and enhancing natural habitats; # Promoting the sound management of wild, free- ranging elk, which may be hunted or otherwise enjoyed; # Fostering cooperation among federal, state, tribal, and private organizations and individuals in wildlife management and habitat conservation; and # Educating members and the public about habitat conservation, the value of hunting, hunting ethics, and wildlife management. Since 1984, the RMEF helped to conserve more than 6.7 million acres (26,700 km¬≤) of habitat. RMEF also helped to restore long-absent elk populations, with herds being reestablished in Kentucky, North Carolina, Ontario, Tennessee, Missouri, Virginia and Wisconsin. RMEF strives to be a strong voice for hunters in access, wildlife management, and conservation policy issues. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation believes that hunting is conservation, that every citizen is entitled to hunt and fish, and that science-based, state-regulated hunting drives wildlife conservation and management. In September 2020, The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and its partners supported $2.6 million in wildlife protection in Colorado. Torstenson Family Endowment In 2002, Bob Torstenson endowed the 93,403 acre (378 km¬≤) Double H Ranch, later named the Torstenson Wildlife Center, in west-central New Mexico to the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation. In 2012 the RMEF, working with the Torstenson family, made a gift transition of the ranch resulting in the establishment of the Torstenson Family Endowment (TFE), one of the largest endowments ever for a wildlife conservation organization. The ranch is forever protected and conserved through a conservation easement maintained by the RMEF. RMEF will use proceeds from the TFE exclusively to further its core mission programs: permanent land protection, habitat stewardship, elk restoration and hunting heritage. The TFE allows RMEF to increase project funding by attracting matching funds both from the private and public sectors, and allows RMEF to much more quickly meet and head off the habitat changes and challenges taking place across the United States. Legislation The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation supported the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2014 (S. 2363; 113th Congress), which would have exempted lead-based ammunition from regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act. They urged members to support the bill, saying that it considers the bill \\"to be of vital importance for conservation, wildlife, and sportsmen and women.\\" The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation said that they supported the bill because it \\"protects the use of traditional ammunition, allows more flexibility for federal funds to be used to build and maintain ranges on public lands and ensures access to federal lands for hunting, shooting and other outdoor activities.\\"  Television Show  The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation produces a television show called, \\"RMEF Team Elk\\" hosted by Brandon Bates. The show focuses on elk, elk habitat and elk hunting and features the importance of conservation and hunting heritage.

The museum first opened on August 8, 1983, at the former site of the United States Taiwan Defense Command. It was the first museum in Taiwan built for contemporary art exhibitions. The architecture is a local interpretation of the Japanese Metabolist Movement, and the building was designed by architect Kao Er-Pan. History In 1976, following the central government's decision enhance the cultural life of city, the Taipei Municipal Government embarked on a plan to build a high-standard museum. From 1984 until 1990, the Taipei Fine Arts Museum's most prestigious event was the \\"Trends of Modern Art in the R.O.C.\\". This was a biennial exhibition which promoted Chinese modernity in art and mostly invited artists with a R.O.C. passport or equivalent ancestry. This national, competition style, exhibition was replaced in 1992 by the Taipei Biennial and the Taipei Prize. The Taipei Biennial had curators or critics invite an artist to exhibit, while the Taipei Prize continued to serve as a competition style event aimed at discovering young or unknown artists. Since its opening, TFAM's mission has been to promote both Chinese modern art and international exchange. Since its early years it has hosted numerous international exhibitions, often sponsored by foreign cultural institutions such as the British Institute or the Goethe Institute. In 1989 it sent its first exhibition abroad. It was held in Japan and was entitled \\"Message from Taipei\\". One of the most prominent of these national exhibitions abroad was held in 1996/1997 in Aachen at the Museum Ludwig and in Berlin at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt as \\"Taiwan: Kunst Heute\\". Since the mid-1990s, the TFAM's mission changed to promoting a Taiwanese identity in contemporary art, most visibly by organizing a national Taiwanese Pavilion at the Venice Biennial, and by dedicating the Taipei Biennial to the question of Taiwanese identity. In 1996 the largest ever Taipei Biennial was held under the title \\"The Quest for Identity\\", involving 110 artists and all floors of the building. Since 1995 the TFAM has organized the Taiwan Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, which from 1995 until 2000 was recognized as a national pavilion. Starting in 1997 China exerted diplomatic pressure against the use of the name \\"Republic of China\\", and by 2001 the TFAM's Taiwan Pavilion in Venice was relegated to the list of institutional participations, and later to the category of collateral events. Since 2000, the Taichung National Museum of Arts organizes a participation at Venice's architecture biennial. While the TFAM had been happy to represent \\"Taiwan\\", the Taichung National Museum of Art insisted on the use of the name \\"R.O.C.\\", which became the diplomatic deathknell to a national pavilion. The loss of an official national representation has inspired other museums in Taiwan to organize exhibitions at the Venice Biennale as well, such as the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts in 2007, and MoCA Taipei in 2009. Since 1998 the Taipei Biennial has become an international event, curated by an international star curator. The first experiment in Asian internationalization was led by Fumio Nanjo under the title Site of Desire in 1998. Since 2000 the international curator is invited to choose a local co- curator, who then selects five to six local artists to participate at Taiwan's most prestigious art event. After 2000, funding and institutional backing for the Taipei Biennial have been dwindling, both compared to other Asian Biennials as well as privately backed exhibitions at the TFAM, regularly inciting criticism from the local art scene. The TFAM has a rather interesting institutional history of interaction with the local art scene. In 1986 the first director, Su Rui-ping, had to step down after she had eliminated the installation of artist Zhang Jianfu from an \\"experimental\\" exhibition with her own feet, and in 1985 had a red metal sculpture called \\"Unlimited Minimalism\\" of Li Zai-qian repainted in silver. As a form of late justice, in 2006 a red sculpture called \\"Homerun\\" was permanently installed on the plaza facing the main entrance. In 1988 performance artist Lee Ming-Sheng was beaten up by museum guards when he brought a glass of his feces to a public discussion during the \\"World of Dada\\" exhibition, which also featured Duchamp's famous urinal. In 1993 Lee became the first Taiwanese artist to be invited to the Venice Biennale. In 1995 newly appointed director Chang Chen-yu was forced to step down after months of protests of the art scene against his style of leadership and his use of museum funds. With the turn of the millennium and the growing professionalization of the art scene, this close- quarter relationship between the museum and the local art scene has considerably changed: at the 2004 Taipei Biennial, the statement of the local curator was eliminated from the official catalogue, without creating any major repercussions. In 2001, the Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei was established in the Taipei City Government old building. Transportation The museum is within walking distance of the Taipei Metro's Yuanshan Station.

Liability incurred in relation to property damage (such as damage to vehicles, buildings, vehicle contents) is excluded from cover. The Road Accident Fund operates a system whereby the claimant is assigned a percentage of responsibility for the accident, and the Road Accident Fund pays the claimant a percentage of a full settlement based on a percentage that was not deemed to be their responsibility. Insurance premiums are collected by the Road Accident Fund through a levy on motor vehicle fuel.  RAF at a glance  =Organisational overview = Mandate  The RAF is a juristic person established by an Act of Parliament, namely, the Road Accident Fund Act, 1996 (Act No. 56 of 1996), as amended (‚ÄùRAF Act‚Äù). It commenced operations on 1 May 1997, assuming at the time, all the rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of the Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund. The RAF is responsible for providing compulsory social insurance cover to all users of South African roads; to rehabilitate and compensate persons injured as a result of the negligent driving of motor vehicles in a timely and caring manner; and to actively promote the safe use of all South African roads. Section 3 of the RAF Act stipulates that \\"the object of the Fund shall be the payment of compensation in accordance with this Act for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of a motor vehicle\\". The customer base of the RAF, therefore, comprises not only the South African public, but all foreigners within the borders of the country. The RAF provides two types of cover, namely personal insurance cover to accident victims or their families, and indemnity cover to wrongdoers.  Predecessors  Prior to 1997, the system of compulsory motor vehicle accident insurance was governed by the following legislation: * Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 1942 (Act No. 29 of 1942) * Compulsory Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 1972 (Act No. 56 of 1972) * Motor Vehicle Accident Act, 1986 (Act No. 84 of 1986) * Multilateral Motor Vehicle Accidents Fund Act, 1989 (Act No. 93 of 1989)  Governing structure  The RAF, as established by the RAF Act, is owned by the South African public. It is listed as a national public entity in accordance with schedule 3A of the PFMA. Government's governance oversight over the RAF includes: * (National Assembly) through the relevant Portfolio Committee and the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (‚ÄúSCOPA‚Äù); The Executive Authority * Honourable Minister of Transport * Board of the RAF. The National Assembly has legislative powers and maintains oversight of the National Executive Authority and the RAF as an organ of State. In addition, Parliament oversees the Executive Authority who is required to provide Parliament with full and regular reports concerning matters under his control. Parliament exercises oversight of the RAF through the Transport Portfolio Committee and through SCOPA. The Portfolio Committee oversees service delivery and performance in accordance with the mandate of the RAF and its corporate strategy. It reviews financial and non-financial information, such as efficiency and effectiveness measures in delivering services against corporate goals. The Minister of Transport is the Executive Authority of the RAF and is concerned with the financial viability and risks of the organisation, as well as policy-making and monitoring of policy implementation to ensure that the RAF effectively delivers on its mandate. The board of directors acts as the Accounting Authority of the RAF and is accountable to the Executive Authority for the performance and affairs of the entity. The RAF's Board is responsible for determining the overall direction of the RAF, formulating and implementing policies that are necessary to achieve the RAF's strategic goals, and maintaining good corporate governance.  Principal activities  The RAF provides compulsory cover to all users of South African roads, both citizens and foreigners, against injuries sustained or death arising from accidents involving motor vehicles within the borders of South Africa. This cover is in the form of indemnity insurance to persons who cause the accident, as well as personal injury and death insurance to victims of motor vehicle accidents and their families.  Economic role  Road transportation is a critical element supporting and directly contributing to growth in any economy. Road accidents are, unfortunately, a negative consequence of this economic growth, affecting both economically active members of our society and other citizens. Free markets, and in particular the private sector, do not fully address the impact of road accidents on society and the economy. The RAF provides a social security safety net to the country and economy by making available compulsory social insurance cover to all users of South African roads. Contributions to the RAF are done by way of a levy on fuel used for road transportation. The cover extends to all members of society including, but not limited to, the poor, children, legal and illegal immigrants, foreigners, owners and drivers of motor vehicles, as well as their passengers. The social insurance cover, however, does not extend to drivers of motor vehicles that are found to be negligent.  Social role  The socio-economic role of the RAF is to re- integrate victims of road accidents into society, from a health and economic perspective, and to protect at-fault drivers and their families from financial ruin. This is done by the RAF paying the medical and related services costs required to restore accident victims to health, compensating the victims or their families for income or support lost as a result of the accident, and indemnifying the wrongdoer from liability. In addition, the RAF pays general damages to accident victims as compensation for pain and suffering, loss of amenities of life, disability and disfigurement, as well as funeral costs to families in circumstances where the victim of the accident sustains fatal injuries.  Vision/mission  The vision of the RAF is ‚Äúto provide the highest standard of care to road accident victims to restore balance in the social system‚Äù. The mission of the RAF is ‚Äúto provide appropriate cover to all road users within the borders of South Africa; to rehabilitate persons injured, compensate for injuries or death and indemnify wrongdoers as a result of motor vehicle accidents in a timely, caring and sustainable manner; and to support the safe use of our roads‚Äù. = Funding = The RAF can obtain its funding from several sources as outlined below: ‚Ä¢Fuel levy income ‚Ä¢Government grants, paid by National Treasury when there is a pressing need such as an acute cash shortage ‚Ä¢Borrowings/loans, which are an allowed source of funding according to the RAF Act. This option has not been used to date ‚Ä¢Investment income, acquired from invested funds that occasionally result when the RAF's operational capacity prevents it from paying out all its funds.  RAF Fuel levy  The primary source of income for the RAF compensation scheme is a levy raised on fuel. The levy is measured in terms of cents per litre on petrol and diesel fuel sold in South Africa and forms part of the general fuel tax regulated by government. The fuel levy per litre is set by National Treasury on a yearly basis, whereas total fuel sales are influenced by a number of macro-economic factors. On an annual basis, the RAF requests National Treasury for an increase in the RAF Fuel Levy, based on a financial model and a calculation of its costs during the coming year. The full extent of the RAF Fuel Levy requested is seldom granted. This is because National Treasury has historically set the levy on the basis of a pay-as-you-go principle rather than with the purpose of establishing a fully funded position for the RAF. During the 2012 financial year the RAF Fuel Levy was set at 80 cents per litre. The RAF is not involved in the collection of its fuel levy. The South African Revenue Service (‚ÄúSARS‚Äù) administers the collection of the fuel levy and pays it to the RAF, in accordance with provisions of the Customs and Excise Act, 1964 (Act No. 91 of 1964) and the RAF Act. The two main variables that determine the income of the RAF are the volume of petrol and diesel sold per annum and the rate of the levy. The RAF Fuel Levy can be viewed as a compulsory contribution to social security benefits which is used only for the specific purposes as provided for in legislation.  Financial Position  The RAF is affected by general economic conditions and other environmental factors, and by the extent to which it manages its costs effectively. The nexus of all these factors is road activity in South Africa: ‚Ä¢The number of vehicles on the road influences the amount of fuel sold, which in turn affects the revenue granted to the RAF by National Treasury. This revenue comprises the fuel levy together with ad hoc government grants and minor income from investments to equal the RAF's total revenue. ‚Ä¢The number of vehicles on the road also influences the number of accidents, although many other factors influence this statistic, particularly the relative severity of accidents. Volume and severity of accidents influence the volume and average value of claims made against the RAF. Claims, combined with the cost of third parties, such as attorneys and medical/legal experts, and the RAF's administration costs, equal the RAF's total costs. = Locations = The head office is in Centurion. Other offices are in Menlyn, Pretoria, Johannesburg, East London, Durban, and Cape Town.

Big John Wallace plays Mr. Tanner by singing the chorus to \\"O Holy Night\\" in the background to the song's chorus. Story The song tells the story of Martin Tanner, a local launderer from Dayton, Ohio, who has a gift for singing. His friends try to talk him into becoming a singer because of his beautiful voice, until he finally agrees and uses most of his savings to travel to New York City and sing in a show. He holds a concert only to get panned by critics. He returns home and never sings again, except for only to himself when he sorts through the clothes at night. Origin The song is based on a review Chapin read in The New York Times. The singer, Martin Tubridy, performed twice, once in 1971 and once in 1972 and his performances were panned. It is unclear which article was the basis for the song of Mr. Tanner, as it seems both reviews are used in the vocal part in Mr. Tanner. In fact, certain details of the song may have simply been an improvisation of Chapin, as the real-life Martin Tubridy about whom the reviews were written was not in fact from Dayton, nor did he work as a launderer, but rather a baritone from Weston, Connecticut who at one point rented Carnegie Hall and continued to perform locally despite the lukewarm critical reception of New York performance. Tubridy himself did not know that he was inspiration for Chapin's song until the mid-90s, but upon learning of it became a fan of Chapin's music. He himself would later, at request, perform the song that he inspired before an audience in concert for the Harry Chapin Foundation, making a subtle shift in the lyrics of the final line of the song's chorus, \\"He did not know how well he sang, it just made me whole.\\" References Further reading * Mr. Tanner (2017), a picture book set to the lyric by Harry Chapin, Ripple Grove Press External links * \\"Mr. Tanner\\" lyrics * Category:Harry Chapin songs Category:1974 songs Category:Songs written by Harry Chapin Category:Song recordings produced by Paul Leka Category:Songs about music ","title":"Mr. Tanner"},{"id":"9863341","text":": For the soil type, see oxisol.

It follows the misadventures of the students of fictional College University in Manchester, New Hampshire, and their dealings with figures from pop culture, state and local politics, and the media. It is published in strip form weekly by Neighborhood News, Inc. in their print publications and on NewHampshire.com, and as part of NewHampshire.com's insert in the New Hampshire Union Leader. It is also appears periodically in graphic-novel format at FileFishComics.com. The title is a spoof of the New Hampshire state motto, \\"Live Free or Die\\". The weekly strip in its current form began in 2004. It is a spin-off of the graphic novel series of the same name begun in 1989, and was preceded by another weekly comic with the same cast, entitled Over the Counter Culture, which ran in Boston College's The Heights from 1996 through 1999. Yuenger created the comic originally to make fun of the industrial arts faculty at his middle school, and later expanded it to include public figures and classmates from Manchester High School Central, who formed the basis of the characters. Yuenger publishes his work as \\"FileFish Comics\\", but is in fact the only person behind the company. Synopsis The content of the series is largely episodic, usually focusing on efforts by the students to entertain themselves in a city largely devoid of entertainment options. In doing so, they typically run afoul of the Union Leader and its publisher, whose far-right values oppose anything the kids would consider to be fun. The central protagonist is Pete, a 21-year-old divorced college student and actor. Long-term plot arcs have dealt with the college dean's attempt to clone the faculty for cheap labor (issues 91‚Äì97), the students' participation in a civil war in a fictional banana republic (issues 53‚Äì54, 72‚Äì73, 104‚Äì107), and Pete and Amy's marriage (issues 78, 98‚Äì99, 101). Several issues (55, 76‚Äì77, 87) involve run-ins with members of the Zendik commune. The weekly strips have featured shorter stories dealing with former governor Craig Benson reduced to working in a convenience store, publisher Joseph McQuaid being visited by the ghost of his chain-smoking former teen idol who begs him not to oppose anti- smoking legislation, and Manchester mayor Robert A. Baines attempting to infiltrate the city's nightlife to foil crime. Recent strips have dealt with the influx of presidential candidates to the city ahead of the 2008 New Hampshire primary. Main characters * Pete ‚Äî Pete is the de facto main character of the series. He is generally the victim of the actions of everyone else around him. He has squinty eyes, curly black hair, and wears a blue turtleneck sweater. Pete is an actor in The Maskers, the college's drama club. His ex-wife is Amy, who he began dating in Over the Counter Culture and married in issue #78. They separated in issue #98 when Amy discovered she was a lesbian. Following a mental breakdown, Pete has since lived with Shawn and James. He also has a rarely seen younger brother, Danny, and a pet boa constrictor. Pete, Danny and Amy all share the 'Boisvert Nose', a genetic condition marked by a rounded, bulbous nose. * Amy ‚Äî Amy is Pete's ex-wife. She has large eyes, long black hair, and usually dresses in shades of grey and black. She is addicted to Vertigo Comics and Slash fiction. Amy is known for her sexual openness and activity in the BDSM scene. She operates the website MexicanSexActs.com, where she pretends to be a Mexican man with a salsa fetish, sporting a mustache. The character of Amy is partly based on sex enthusiast Audacia Ray. * Jimmy ‚Äî Jimmy is an insecure young man with sandy brown hair and freckles. He wears a Star Trek uniform and a priest's collar. Jimmy joined the priesthood in an ill-fated attempt to win the love of a girl named Libby, who he felt would be impressed with his dedication. He is frequently bullied by his friend Lleij and torn between his priestly vows and his lust for Libby, who refuses to acknowledge him. * Lleij ‚Äî Lleij is a part- time talk show host, inventor, and nerd. He is dark-skinned and wears a bow- tie and button down shirt with a pocket protector. Lleij lives in his parents' basement and uses Jimmy as his guinea pig when conducting experiments. * Nate ‚Äî Nate is a green-haired slacker who performs in a two-man band and lives in a tent behind the school, where he has pretended to be a student without actually enrolling. He has held several temporary jobs including lumberjack, backpack-stuffer, vacuum salesman, reporter for the Union Leader, and convenience store clerk. * Trish ‚Äî Trish is a blonde hippy girl who heads the militant activist group Students 4 Socialist Justice. She carries a pistol and often resorts to violence to get her way. Trish helped Pal the janitor clear himself of murder charges by bringing him to the Zendik commune, where he learned kung-fu and how to speak intelligibly and avenge himself. Trish has a strong cult following, and memorabilia with her likeness (T-shirts, mugs, etc.) is quite valuable to e-bay bidders. * Rolly ‚Äî Rolly is the students' former high-school principal, who quit to follow them to college so he could continue to torment them as the school's dean. He has a homoerotic relationship with Dan, his sidekick and the school's quarterback, who lives with him in a bunker beneath the school. Rolly's appearance is modeled after Sludge Vohaul from the Space Quest videogames. * Joseph McQuaid ‚Äî Joe is the publisher of the Union Leader, an ultraconservative newspaper that uses its undue influence to control the town's politics. He generally fails in his efforts to live up to the \\"evil\\" of his predecessor, Nackey Loeb, despite receiving an injection of her DNA. The Huevolarian War The current plot of the graphic novels concerns the Huevolarian War, an attempt by the American government to prop up the corrupt government of Huevolaria through military intervention. In issue #53, Amy Cameron of Students 4 Socialist Justice became involved in the Huevolarian Civil War, helping to train a band of communist rebels (all named \\"Juan\\") in their struggle against the dictator Juan Volaro Cortazio. Cortazio had grown insane, and believed he was actually Tony Garza, the hero of Amy's high school Spanish textbook. Amy fled Huevolaria with the Juans, and brought them to her prom to hide them. Cortazio pursued her home to Manchester, and captured them all. In issue #72, Shalome went to Huevolaria to negotiate Amy's freedom, and found that Amy had become a rich drug kingpin. Amy repented, and they attempted to reenter the United States, but were stopped at the Texas border by Ross Perot, dressed as a Boy Scout. Once again Amy returned to Huevolaria, hoping to undo the damage she had caused. In issue #104, President George W. Bush named Huevolaria part of the Rhombus of Inconvenience, and attacked the rebels on behalf of Cortazio. Rolly tricked his students into enlisting, but was surprised than Dan had also volunteered in order to impress women. Trish and Shalome went to Huevolaria to protest the war, only to discover Amy and rescue her again. During the war, Matt was shot (but survived), and Amy Cameron met Pete's ex Amy, who had taken the \\"Amy\\" spot in the comic during her absence. Amy Cameron decided to go by her surname of Cameron rather than fight for the right to the \\"Amy\\" role. Cameron was able to rally the Juans against Cortazio, the Americans, and Cortazio's henchman, Bruno, and the Juans won the war. Dan was discharged honorably but refused to be used for propaganda by Rolly and McQuaid, and instead left the school and moved in with Rolly's mom. Dan and Rolly eventually reconciled, and adopted a daughter, \\"Rollina\\". Compilations Unofficial photocopy collections of the comic date back to the early 1990s and were edited by the real-life inspiration for the character of Pete, Pete Boisvert, at Yuenger's request. CD-ROM's were issued later, covering most material through the year 2000. Yuenger began printing paperback collections of issues #91 onwards beginning in 2005, and issued self-published hardcover collections in 2007. Criticism Yuenger has been criticized by members of the Zendik movement for his portrayal of Wulf Zendik and life at the Zendik commune. He has also been chided for originally using the full names of private individuals who inspired the characters in the comic. In recent years, the characters' surnames have not been mentioned as often (the exceptions being public figures such as Dean Kamen and Joe McQuaid) and have been removed entirely from the FileFish Comics website. Some readers have also complained the comic blurs the line between fiction and reality by featuring \\"real\\" people and using some real events as the basis for otherwise fictional plots. Yuenger has said he has received hate mail from readers opposed to his liberal political views, since the publications that run Leave Freeze or Die are politically conservative. The publisher of the Union Leader, which carries the strip in an insert, is portrayed as one of the comic's main villains. References * Feinberg, Cara. Boston College Magazine.

He is regarded as the Father of Burmese nationalist and peace movements as well as a literary genius. His legacy and influence on the post-war generations can still be felt in both literature and the ongoing political situation in Myanmar (Burma). Formative years Hmaing was born Maung Lun Maung in Wale village near Shwedaung in Lower Burma. He was sent at an early age to be educated in the traditional manner in Mandalay, and at the age of 9 he witnessed the fall of the Konbaung dynasty and the abduction of King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat by the British, being taken away in a carriage, near the queen's own Myadaung Monastery where he was a boarder. It was a scene that he would never forget and one that sparked his nationalist fervour in a lifelong struggle for independence. Literary genius In 1894 Hmaing moved to Rangoon (now Yangon) to start his career as a playwright, and switched to journalism, later on writing articles for a newspaper in Moulmein (now Mawlamyaing). In 1903 he married Ma Shin whom he had met in Rangoon before moving to Moulmein, and returned to the capital as the nationalist movement was gaining momentum in 1911 to work for the Thuriya (Sun) newspaper. Writing under his own name Maung Lun or Saya Lun, he had already reached a wide audience by now through traditional stage plays written in verse and based on historical Burmese myth and legend. He contributed regularly to the paper and other publications such as the Dagon magazine where he later became an editor. His mastery of classical Burmese literature enabled him to write extensively in verse with such ease and flair that future generations of writers still find hard to match. A genius in multiple and complex rhyme, here is one of his couplets that has often been quoted: Kaung myo ahtweidwei yen√® chunzei myazei saw, daung owei yelo tunzei kazei thaw () - \\"May a myriad good things with vigour have a chance; may the peacock have its call and dance\\". The dancing peacock (, ka daung) was the emblem of Burmese sovereignty featured on pennants, coins and currency notes, whereas the fighting peacock (, hkut daung) is the emblem of Burmese student unions. Owei is the call of the peacock and was also the title of the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU) magazine. Hmaing also wrote in mixed verse and prose style brilliantly presenting satires in the form of learned religious commentaries, called htikas () in Pali, such as Hkway htika (On Dogs) in which he castigated politicians for wasting their time and effort in futile squabbling when they should be concentrating on the fight against colonial rule. # Kja htika- On Lotus 1912 # Bo htika - On Chiefs 1914 # Daung htika - On Peacocks 1920 # Sone nadha myaing htika- On Full of Fragrance Forest Quest Poem 1921 # Myauk htika - On Monkeys 1923 # Hkway htika - On Dogs 1925 # Mjin htika - On Horse 1925 # Swaraj htika- On Swaraj 1925 # Hse gadei kyaw htika- On Over Hundred Million 1926 # Boingkauk htika - On Boycott 1927 # Galonbyan dipani htika - On the Flying Garuda 1931 # Thakin htika - On Thakins 1938 # Nagani htia- On Red Dragon 1940 Mr Maung Hmaing A novel titled Missata Maung Hmaing hmadawbon wuttu (the Epistles of Mr Maung Hmaing) written under the pseudonym Mr Maung Hmaing in 1916 immediately caused a furore which was also the intended effect. Maung Hmaing was the name of the main character, a Casanova-like scoundrel, in a popular novel at the time called Chinbaungywet the Maung Hmaing (The Roselle Vendor Maung Hmaing) by U Kyee (1848‚Äì1908), and Hmaing by taking his name and styling himself Mister at the same time was mocking the affectation among some fashionable Anglophile Burmese who had started putting Mr in front of their names. It did stop the trend. And the name stuck. National leader Hmaing joined the nationalist Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association) in 1934 and quickly rose to become the leader of young Thakins - a title that proclaimed they were the true masters of their own land, not the British who had usurped the title. He thus came to be known as Thakin Kodaw Hmaing (Master Lord Hmaing), and later Sayagyi (great teacher) Thakin Kodaw Hmaing. He is also considered to be unequalled in another traditional form of poetry called Laygyo gyi () which he revived to great effect by giving it a new content of contemporary political issues. Hmaing inspired a whole generation of Burmese nationalists in the fight for independence, fostering immense pride in their own history, language and culture, and more importantly urging them to take direct action such as strikes by students and workers, the subject of Boingkauk htika (On Boycott). He showed no mercy to those who were mere political opportunists either, as in Hkway htika (On Dogs). His allusive and highly memorable style of verse made him very popular with the Burmese public and shielded his work from colonial government censorship. In the wake of the second university students strike in history of 1936 when the All Burma Students Union (ABSU) was formed, Hmaing was elected its patron. By 1941 his reputation as a leading nationalist earned him a place on the colonial authorities' 'Burma List', regarded as an 'enemy of the state'. It was Hmaing along with other leaders of the Dobama who sent Aung San and other young men - later known as the 'Thirty Comrades' - to seek military training abroad in order to fight the British. Peace activist Thakin Kodaw Hmaing's mausoleum on Shwedagon Pagoda Road, Yangon After independence in 1948 the country immediately plunged into a widespread civil war which caused great sorrow to Hmaing, and he spent the rest of his life trying to bring internal peace to the land. He was a leading light in the world peace movement in Burma, and in 1952 attended the Peace Conference for Asia Pacific Region in Peking. He was elected Chairman of the World Peace Congress (Burma) the same year, and won the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954. Hmaing also travelled to People's Republic of China, Mongolia, Hungary and the Soviet Union in 1953, and went to Ceylon and India for the World Peace Conference in 1957. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1960 by the University of Hamburg, West Germany. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing gave his active support together with the former Brig.General Kyaw Zaw to the Internal Peace Committee during the 1963 peace parley between the Union Revolutionary Council government of Ne Win and various armed rebel groups including the Communist Party of Burma, Red Flag Communists, and ethnic minorities. Hmaing's was the one voice that all parties across the political divide would listen to with respect, and remained the only alternative political voice the military could not silence, after they took power in 1962, until his death at the age of 88 in 1964 when all political parties except the ruling Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) were abolished by decree. He devoted his time to peace and national reconciliation with less time for writing towards the end of his life, stating that his last wish was to see a peaceful and united country. He was buried at Kandawmin Garden Mausolea near the Shwedagon Pagoda, and on March 23, 1976, the centenary of Hmaing's birth (Hmaing yabyei), over 100 students were arrested for holding a peaceful ceremony at his mausoleum. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing was, in Anna Allott's words, \\"a man of many skills - a true Buddhist and a staunch patriot; poet and playwright; historian and teacher; pioneer writer and satirist - Thakin Kodaw Hmaing is the single most revered literary figure in modern Burma\\".

A Vickers Viscount flying the route crashed into a farm in Charles City County, Virginia, on January 18, 1960. The accident was the fourth fatal crash involving a Capital Viscount in less than two years; the first three were Capital Airlines Flight 67 (April 1958), Capital Airlines Flight 300 (May 1958) and Capital Airlines Flight 75 (May 1959). The plane was cruising at an altitude of 8,000 feet when it encountered icing. This caused two engines to fail. As the craft descended, the other two engines also failed, causing the propellers to autofeather. The crew tried and failed to restart the engines, and were unable to unfeather the propellers normally; they then put the plane into a dive in an attempt to force the propellers from their feathered position. Eventually they succeeded in restarting engine number four. They applied full power to this engine, which caused the craft to enter a circling descent until crashing into trees; at the time of impact it had almost no forward velocity. Five trees were driven through the fuselage, yet their trunks remained intact. The crash was attributed to the fact that, as per airline policy, the pilots had delayed arming the engine ice protection systems even though they were flying in icy conditions; this caused the engines to lose too much power. Capital Airlines changed its emergency checklist after the crash, deleting the instruction that pilots were to descend to a warmer climate to relight the systems and instructing them that, provided that correct procedure was followed, the engine could be restarted at any height.

Plain blamed his defeat on Harvey's friendship with then-MLA Ernie Jamison, who also owned the St. Albert Gazette, and called his defeat \\"a plague on our house\\".Edmonton Journal, 20 October 1977 Between 1979 and 1981, as chair of the St. Albert Citizens Committee, Plain led the fight against a proposal from Edmonton to annex St. Albert, which he called \\"one of the greatest things this community will ever see\\".St. Albert Gazette (1999). St. Albert 1861-1999: Our Story, St. Albert: Gazette Press Ltd. In 2001, Plain, newly retired from academia, announced his intention to challenge incumbent mayor Paul Chalifoux. The ensuing election was fought largely on the issue of the West Regional Road, with Chalifoux favouring the recently proposed Ray Gibbon Drive alignment. Plain preferred the previously proposed alignment, which bypassed the developed portion of the city but crossed the Sturgeon River close to the mouth of Big Lake, and proposed a plebiscite on the subject. An aggressive public relations campaign by the Riel Park Business Association, which did not like the way the proposed road would pass through Riel Business Park, and a group calling itself S.E.N.S.I.B.L.E. Choice, attacked the alignment. Plain received the endorsement from S.E.N.S.I.B.L.E. Choice and he, along with the five aldermanic candidates the group endorsed, was elected. Plain's second term as mayor was dominated by four issues. Plain's favoured plebiscite on the road was rejected by a majority of Council in favour of proceeding immediately with the original alignment. Plain quickly fell into step with this majority view, and was criticized for it by many citizens who continued to favour the rejected Ray Gibbon Drive alignment. In addition, Plain opposed the agreement made by the Chalifoux Council to split tax revenues from land recently annexed from Sturgeon County with the County, claiming that St. Albert would require all of the tax revenues in order to service the land. This position put him at odds with Sturgeon County mayor Lawrence Kluthe, and a feud developed between the two. Third, Plain oversaw preliminary plans for the development of the multi-purpose leisure centre that would eventually become Servus Credit Union Place. Fourth and finally, Plain's Council brought in a bylaw prohibiting smoking in all places of business, including those open only to adults. Chalifoux ran again in 2004 and, in an election dominated by a bitter dispute over how to deal with Sturgeon County, narrowly defeated Plain.

Released in June 1988 by Creation Records, the album was a critical success. It appeared in many 1988 critics' lists, in NME, Melody Maker, and Sounds. Background The album was recorded following the departure member of founder member Andrea Heukamp, who had played on the band's early singles.House of Love biography by Dave Roberts (on fansite) Her only appearance on the album was playing guitar and singing backing vocals on the song \\"Christine\\" (the first song which group leader Guy Chadwick had written for The House of Love and had inspired the blueprint for the band's original lineup and style). Although the split was amicable, Chadwick would later comment \\"Losing Andrea Heukamp was a massive, massive blow for me: I loved her voice and I loved her playing, she was easily as important as Pete (Evans), Terry (Bickers) or Chris (Groothuizen).\\"Sleevenotes for the 2007 Renascent reissue of The House of Love Despite the loss of Heukamp, the remaining four members continued with the recording of the debut album. The only single which would make it onto the album was \\"Christine\\": surprisingly, neither of the band's first two singles (\\"Shine On\\" and \\"Real Animal\\") were included. Instead the band drew on other songs which Chadwick had built up. These included \\"Touch Me\\", which was the first song that Chadwick had ever written (and which, in 2007, remained his favourite), \\"Man to Child\\" (which stemmed from his anxieties about \\"feeling old at the age of 26\\") and \\"Road\\" (written about his experiences and feelings of alienation on the squatting scene following his move to London from the Midlands). \\"Love in a Car\\" was based on \\"an affair which went on too long\\" while \\"Hope\\" and \\"Sulphur\\" drew on Chadwick's failed first marriage (he would describe the songs as \\"the only positive thing that came out of it.\\") Although the recording sessions for the album were completed in just over a week, the mixing sessions - allegedly fuelled by copious use of LSD - proved more problematic, with producer Pat Collier dealing with the final mix after disagreements within the band. The album was preceded by the release of \\"Christine\\" as a single in May 1988, which reached No. 1 in the independent charts. The album itself was released later in May. As with the band's previous early singles compilation, the album lacked a title and featured only the band's name on the record sleeve: consequently the album became known simply as The House of Love. A subsequent non-album single, \\"Destroy The Heart\\", was eventually voted single of the year in John Peel's Festive Fifty and was added to the end of the next pressing of The House of Love (although it was removed from the 2007 reissue of the album). In 2007 the reformed House of Love performed the album live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series. Title confusion The first three long-form House of Love releases - this album, the previous German-market early singles compilation, and the band's 1990 album on Fontana Records - would all lack of an evident title. To avoid confusion, the three untitled releases would be distinguished by informal titles: The German Album (the singles collection, due to its initial release in Germany), the 1988 album remains referred to as The House Of Love or as Creation (regarding the record label), and the 1990 album is often referred to as either Fontana (after the record label it was released on) or The Butterfly Album (after the sleeve art).

Its purpose is to provide a location where students of Siddha Yoga can study the philosophy and culture of the Siddha Yoga path and follow its daily practices (known as sadhana). Shree Muktananda Ashram houses the headquarters of the SYDA Foundation, the organization that protects, preserves, and facilitates the dissemination of the Siddha Yoga teachings. The ashram is located in the hamlet of Fallsburg, approximately 130 kilometres north-west of New York City.Macmillan Family Encyclopedia, 1980, Vol.14, p.149 History The ashram that is currently known as Shree Muktananda Ashram was founded by Swami Muktananda, who was the disciple of the Indian guru Bhagavan Nityananda and the guru of the current spiritual head of the Siddha Yoga path Swami Chidvilasananda. Meditation Revolution, Brooks (Agama Press) 1997, p.110 Between 1970 and 1981, Muktananda undertook three world tours, establishing Siddha Yoga ashrams and centers in several countries. During his third world tour, Muktananda inaugurated Shree Nityananda Ashram in honour of his guru Bhagawan Nityananda.Meditation Revolution, Brooks (Agama Press) 1997. After Swami Muktananda's death in 1982, his successor Gurumayi Chidvilasananda changed the name of the ashram to Shree Muktananda Ashram.Meditation Revolution, p.564 The early ashram was established in a former hotel. The SYDA (Siddha Yoga Dham Associates) Foundation -- established by Muktananda in 1974 as the administrative organization for Siddha Yoga -- bought the Gilbert Hotel, situated on Brickman Road, Fallsburg. Extensive renovations began and the site became the location of the offices that were to administer Siddha Yoga activities globally.Meditation Revolution, p.562 In the summer of 1979, Siddha Yoga devotees gathered for the first retreat in the former Gilbert Hotel. A former ballroom became a meditation room and a temple honoring Nityananda was built. In 1983, another hotel in the area, the Windsor, was acquired and converted to dormitory accommodation and offices. This centre became known as Sadhana Kutir. This facility has since been sold. In 1985, construction began on a large open-air pavilion known as Shakti Mandapa, which was located behind the original hotel building, now known as Anugraha (divine grace). In the following year, the SYDA Foundation bought the Brickman Hotel, also on Brickman Road, which became known as Atma Nidhi (treasure of the soul). From the inception of Shree Muktananda Ashram until 2004, the SYDA Foundation offered retreats and courses at the ashram. Since then, courses and retreats have been created by the SYDA Foundation at Shree Muktananda Ashram for dissemination globally via local Siddha Yoga centres and via the Internet.

The Nossa Senhora dos M√°rtires, is the name of a cargo ship wrecked in 1606 at the mouth of the River Tagus, near Lisbon, Portugal, and subsequently excavated between 1996 and 2001. The ship had been seeking safer anchorage in the Tagus during strong winds, but she struck a submerged rock and went down close to shore with no loss of life. Also known as The Pepper Wreck, it is so called because its major cargo at the time was peppercorns of black pepper, Piper nigrum, which carpeted the river and were harvested along with the fittings and other cargo by the population. The Museu Nacional de Arqueologia identified the debris on the bottom in 1993 and designated the site as S√£o Juli√£o da Barra 2 (SJB2).Castro (2005) page 4. The ship was of a type called the \\"nau\\", a cargo vessel, used as an Indiaman. Constructed in 1605 in the Ribeira das Naus, the royal shipyard in Lisbon, it set sail under captain Manuel Barreto in that year as part of an armada, or convoy, consisting of ten ships: four galleons and six naus, sent out by the Casa da √çndia, a government trade organization,Castro (2005) page 13. to Goa, then under Dutch blockade. After loading a cargo of pepper, classified by the government along with all spices as drogas (\\"drugs\\", literally meaning \\"dry goods\\") it completed the return voyage and anchored off the mouth of the Tagus. A strong wind caused some other ships to pull anchor, inspiring their captains to move further into the river. Seeking to follow their example, the Nossa Senhora dos M√°rtires struck a rock and went down suddenly. The date was 14 September 1606. Although scanty, the hull remains have preserved carpenters marks that allowed a tentative reconstruction of the ship's hull. Until the 2008 discovery of the Bom Jesus shipwreck near Oranjemund in Namibia, this shipwreck was the only known Portuguese Indiaman from the 16th and early 17th centuries not destroyed by treasure hunters.
