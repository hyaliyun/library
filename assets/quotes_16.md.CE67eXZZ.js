That record held for more than three years. Landy ran his second sub-4-minute mile at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, held at Vancouver, British Columbia, in the mile race, but lost to Roger Bannister, who had his best-ever time.

On the final turn of the last lap, as Landy looked over his left shoulder, Bannister passed him on the right. A larger-than-life bronze sculpture of the two men at this moment was created by Vancouver sculptor Jack Harman in 1967 from a photograph by Vancouver Sun photographer Charlie Warner and stood for many years at the entrance to Empire Stadium; after the stadium was demolished, the sculpture was moved to the Hastings and Renfrew entrance of the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) fairgrounds.

A patriotic writer, he created a series of symbolic, national dramas within the artistic philosophy of the Young Poland Movement. Wyspia≈Ñski was one of the most outstanding and multifaceted artists of his time in Poland under the foreign partitions. He successfully joined the trends of modernism with themes of the Polish folk tradition and Romantic history. Unofficially, he came to be known as the Fourth Polish Bard (in addition to the earlier Three Bards: Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz S≈Çowacki, and Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski). Biography Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski was born to Franciszek Wyspia≈Ñski and Maria Rogowska. His father, a sculptor, owned an atelier on Wawel Hill. His mother died of tuberculosis in 1876 when Stanis≈Çaw was seven years old. Due to problems with alcohol, Stanis≈Çaw's father could not fulfil his parental responsibilities. Stanis≈Çaw was adopted by his aunt Joanna Stankiewiczowa and her husband Kazimierz. The Stankiewicz family belonged to the bourgeois intellectual class. In their house, Wyspia≈Ñski became acquainted with painter Jan Matejko, who was a frequent visitor. Matejko soon recognized that the boy had artistic talent and gave him his first artistic guidance. Wyspia≈Ñski attended Saint Anne's secondary school. The school was unique for several reasons. First, although the Polish language was forbidden in educational institutions under foreign rule, the lectures at Saint Anne's were delivered in Polish. Second, the teacher's goal was to equip the students with a thorough knowledge of Polish history and literature. Third, graduates of the school, including Lucjan Rydel, Stanis≈Çaw Estreicher and Henryk Opie≈Ñski, were considered prominent figures in Krak√≥w's cultural life. As a student, Wyspia≈Ñski took particular interest in art and literature. According to Joanna Stankiewiczowa, the young Stanis≈Çaw portrayed small cottages, animals, plants, armors and decorations. Wyspia≈Ñski also created a dramatic interpretation of Matejko's painting Stefan Batory pod Pskowem (Bathory at Pskov). In 1887 Wyspia≈Ñski enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy at Jagiellonian University and the School of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w. While studying at the university, he attended lectures in art, history and literature. Jan Matejko, the dean of the School of Fine Arts, soon recognized Wyspia≈Ñski's talent and asked him to join in the creation of a polychrome inside the Mariacki Church. Planty Park at Dawn, 1894 The years 1890‚Äì1895 were devoted to travel. Wyspia≈Ñski visited Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Prague and France. His stay in France is regarded as a major point in his artistic life. He studied at the private Acad√©mie Colarossi. Since the school fee was very high, Wyspia≈Ñski applied for a grant. During his stay in France he got acquainted with Paul Gauguin. Together they visited art museums, where Wyspia≈Ñski was bewitched by the beauty of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes's paintings. He also attended theatre performances based on Shakespeare and classical era plays. His future dramas Daniel i Meleager (Daniel and Meleagra) and Powr√≥t Odysa (Return of Odysseus) were based on the antic tradition. Meanwhile, he worked on several dramas, Kr√≥lowa Polskiej Korony (The Queen of Polish Crown), Warszawianka (Varsovian Anthem) and the first version of Legenda (Legend). The play Legenda (Legend) was based on the famous Polish legend of Wars and Sawa. In August 1894 he returned to Krak√≥w, where he got involved in the modernist movement. It was then he designed and partially made a polychrome for the Franciscan Church that was composed of flowery, geometrical and heraldic motifs. Moreover, the prior of the church encouraged Wyspia≈Ñski to design various stained glass windows, such as Blessed Salomea, Saint Francis Stigmata and God the Father. Wyspia≈Ñski received an award from the Polish Academy of Learning for the landscape of the Kopiec Ko≈õciuszki (Ko≈õciuszko Mound). As a painter, interior designer and poet he cooperated with the Municipal Theatre in Krak√≥w. First he designed furniture and scenography for the theatre performances, then he staged various dramas on the stage of the theatre. Motherhood, 1905 He cooperated with the Krak√≥w Society of Friends of Fine Art and in mid-1898 was named art manager of the weekly ≈ªycie (Life). Unfortunately, his first published dramas, Legenda (Legend), (1897) and Daniel i Meleager (Daniel and Meleagra) (1898), did not receive the acclaim of the critics. It was the Warszawianka (Varsovian Anthem) that brought instantaneous acclaim to its author. The premiere of the drama marked his debut as a playwright of national dramas. The theatre premiere of the drama on 2 July 1901 starred Helena Modrzejewska as Maria. The years 1899‚Äì1900 marked the publication of Protesilas i Laodamia (Protesilas and Laodamia), Lelewel (Lelevel) and Legion. This drama is regarded to be the author's polemic displaying a romantic vision of history. In 1900, Wyspia≈Ñski married the mother of his four children, Teodora Pytko. In November the same year he participated in the wedding of his friend Lucjan Rydel in Bronowice, a village near Krak√≥w. The wedding party was the inspiration for his widely acclaimed play Wesele (The Wedding). It is a deeply critical yet sarcastic expos√© of Polish society of the 19th century. \\"Wesele\\" transformed Wyspianski from a moderately successful visual and verbal artist associated with the Young Poland movement into a national dramatist-visionary whose significance in Poland is comparable to Yeats's in Ireland, O'Neill's in America, or Maeterlinck's in Belgium.\\" The drama made references to the contemporary situation in Poland and depicted a powerless society. Although censorship barred the sale of copies of Wesele (The Wedding), the play was staged in the theatre. Self-Portrait with Wife at the Window, 1904 After the success of Wesele (The Wedding) four new plays based on Polish history were published: Wyzwolenie (Liberation), Achilles, Boles≈Çaw ≈ömia≈Çy (Boleslaus The Bold) and Legenda II (Legend 2). The following years were devoted to publishing of Ska≈Çka and Powr√≥t Odysa (Return of Odysseus); meanwhile Wyspia≈Ñski translated Corneillea's Cyd (Le Cid) and Voltaire's Za√Øre. In 1906 Wyspia≈Ñski became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w. He was also a member of the city council. In his last years, Wyspianski's health deteriorated. As a result, he underwent medical treatments in Ryman√≥w and Bad Hall and then settled in his small cottage in the village of Wƒôgrzce. He died of syphilis, which was incurable at the time. His funeral took place in Krak√≥w and became a national day of mourning. Wyspia≈Ñski was buried in the Crypt of the Distinguished in the Ska≈Çka Church. Creative output Stained-glass window in Franciscan Church, designed by Wyspia≈Ñski Wyspia≈Ñski's artistic output is very eclectic. Among dramas and poetry, there are views of Cracow (drawings, sketch-books, oil-paintings, pastel drawings), portraits and self-portraits, designs of stained glass windows and paintings, illustrations, graphic art, and designs for furniture and interiors, and development of Wawel. Drawings, such as his 1890 self-portrait, and drafts from his journeys across Europe and Poland, are among Wyspia≈Ñski's better-known works. He later created a herbarium by drawing plants. However, he most frequently used soft pastel techniques; his first pastel drawings were produced between 1890 and 1894. They mainly present the artist's family, friends and other artists. Wyspia≈Ñski eagerly drew his children in everyday situations such as sleeping or feeding, including Helenka (1900), pastel drawing, owned by the National Museum in Krak√≥w; ≈öpiƒÖcy Sta≈õ (Sleeping Sta≈õ) (1902), pastel drawing, Silesian Museum in Katowice; ≈öpiƒÖcy Mietek (Sleeping Mietek) (1904), pastel drawing, Museum of Art in ≈Å√≥d≈∫; Macierzy≈Ñstwo (Motherhood) (1905), pastel drawing, National Museum in Krak√≥w; and ≈ªona artysty z synkiem Stasiem (The Artist's Wife with Their Son Sta≈õ) (1904), pastel drawing, now at the Upper Silesian Museum in Bytom. Using this technique, he painted many of his acquaintances and artists, among others Kazimierz Lewandowski, Jacek Malczewski, Eliza Pare≈Ñska, the Kryszta≈Çowicz family, Ludwik Solski, Irena Solska, and Jan Stanis≈Çawski. He painted landscapes of Krak√≥w ‚Äì the Krak√≥w Planty Park with desmans (also painted in oil), the Vistula Rudawa River, cottages in Grƒôbowo, and at the end of his life, views from his studio to the Ko≈õciuszko Mound. He also created a poster for Maeterlinck's Wnƒôtrze (Interior). Part of his output constitutes various designs ‚Äì mainly stained glass windows, polychromes and interiors. Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski and J√≥zef Mehoffer designed 36 stained glass windows together for the Mariacki Church in Krak√≥w to help Matejko with the church conservation he had been involved with since 1889. During their stay in Paris they both made two boxes for the competition of the Rudolfinum Hall Decoration Design in Prague and curtain designs for the Juliusz S≈Çowacki Theatre in Krak√≥w. However, Wyspia≈Ñski himself designed stained glass windows and polychromes for the Franciscan Church in Krak√≥w (with the famous stained glass window Sta≈Ñ siƒô), stained glass windows depicting Saint Stanislaus, Kazimierz the Great and Henryk Pobo≈ºny for Wawel Cathedral (not executed until 2005‚Äì2007 in the Wyspia≈Ñski 2000 Pavilion), the design of a showroom of the Fine Arts Society (1904), and stairs and hall decoration for the Medical Society. In 1905 Wyspia≈Ñski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Ekielski designed a scheme for redevelopment of the Wawel Hill (the so-called Acropolis).

It is a division of the National Museum, Krak√≥w, sometimes referred to as the Szo≈Çayski Museum. At All Saints' Square, the Wyspia≈Ñski 2000 Information Exhibition Pavilion is a rare example of contemporary architecture in the Old Town, featuring three of Wyspia≈Ñski's stained glass windows. In 1996 a plaque for Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski was unveiled at Hotel Nordbahn (since 2008 Austria Classic Hotel Wien) at Praterstra√üe 72 in Vienna's Leopoldstadt, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the √ñsterreichisch-Polnische Gesellschaft (Austrian- Polish Society) and Wyspia≈Ñski's frequents stays at the hotel, where among other things he wrote his German dramatic fragment \\"Weimar 1829\\" in summer 1904. In front of the new National Museum building in Krak√≥w on 3-go Maja Street there is a monument to Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski. 2007 was named the Year of Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski by the Polish Sejm. Streets of Krak√≥w with Wyspia≈Ñski connections 26 Krupnicza Street Wyspia≈Ñski was born at 26 Krupnicza Street in Krak√≥w, in a house that belonged to his grandparents. He lived there until 1873. 25 Kanonicza Street In the summer of 1873 Wyspianski's family moved to the house of Jan D≈Çugosz. Wyspia≈Ñski's younger brother and mother died here. In the autumn of 1880 Wyspia≈Ñski moved into the house of his uncle and aunt. 1 Kopernika Street Between 1880 and 1883 he lived in the house of the Stankiewicz family, site of the later PTTK Tourist House and the present Wyspia≈Ñski Hotel. 2 Zacisze Street Here was the Stankiewicz family's new apartment. It was on the second floor of the now non-extant Central Hotel at the junction of Zacisze and Basztowa streets, with a view onto the Barbakan and the Planty Park. Because of the hotel's expansion, the Stankiewicz family was forced to move out in 1885. 1 Westerplatte Street (then Kolejowa Street) In July 1895 the Stankiewicz family began living here in an apartment on the ground floor at the corner of Kolejowa and Lubicz streets. Currently at this site there are arcades and stairs to an underground passage. At the time Wyspia≈Ñski had his studio in the nearby village of Grzeg√≥rzki, where he worked on stained glass window designs for the Franciscan Church. 10 Poselska Street After a few months at Westerplatte Street, Wyspia≈Ñski's uncle died and Wyspia≈Ñski and his aunt went to live at 10 Poselska Street in a second-floor apartment. 9 Mariacki Square In July 1898 Wyspia≈Ñski rented a room at the junction of 9 Mariacki Square and 4 Rynek G≈Ç√≥wny. In 1907 the house was taken down and replaced by an Art Nouveau tenement block. The flat was used as a studio. Wyspia≈Ñski at the time was registered at 23 Szlak Street in the house of his future wife, Teofilia Pytko. 79 Krowoderska Street In 1901 Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski received an award from the Academy of Learning for his stained glass windows for the royal castle at Wawel. Thanks to this, he was able to rent a seven-room apartment in a tenement house on the second floor at the corner of Juliusza S≈Çowackiego Avenue (which still exists). He lived here with his family and had his studio here as well. Allegedly there was a sign on the door reading: \\"Here lives Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski and he does not wish to be visited\\". Wƒôgrzce near Krak√≥w After another prize for landscapes depicting the Ko≈õciuszko Mound awarded by the Academy of Learning, Wyspia≈Ñski moved to his own house in the village of Wƒôgrzce (nb 5). The house, now demolished, has been replaced by another private residence. There is a stone at the site with a commemorative plaque erected on the 100th anniversary of the artist's birth. 1 Siemiradzkiego Street The hospital where Wyspia≈Ñski died on 28 November 1907 still exists, although it operates now as a maternity hospital. It is situated on the corner of Siemiradzkiego and ≈Åobzowska streets.

The film stars Jesse Bradford, Erika Christensen, and Shiri Appleby. Plot Ben Cronin is a star swimmer of his high school's swim team. His coach informs him that Stanford University scouts will appear at next week's swim meet. Ben and his girlfriend Amy discuss their future plans. Amy wants to attend school in Rhode Island but explains she will go to school in California to stay close to Ben. The next day, Ben nearly runs his car into Madison Bell and gives her a ride home as an apology. Later, he realizes that Madison left her notebook in his car. The notebook is filled with music notes, and Ben spots his initials written inside a staff. When he returns the notebook, he meets Madison's cousin, Christopher. Madison appears stressed and explains she has not eaten, so Ben offers to take her to dinner. At dinner, Ben tells Madison about his girlfriend, but Madison does not appear too bothered and explains that she has a boy waiting for her in New York City. Ben shares some of his past with Madison; he began doing drugs five years ago, which led to crime and six months in juvenile hall, which \\"saved him\\" because he ultimately realized his passion and talent for swimming. Although Ben tries to end the date, Madison convinces him to go to the pool. Her aggressive flirtation lures Ben in, and despite his initial hesitancy, the two have sex. Both agree to remain friends and not to discuss their encounter. The next night, Ben goes to a party at Amy's house. Amy introduces Ben to her new friend, who turns out to be Madison. The two pretend to have not met one another. Shortly after, Madison obsesses over Ben‚Äîshe stops by his house to meet his mom and bombards Ben with e-mails and instant messages. Ben realizes her unhealthy behavior and demands her to leave him alone. Ben's lying eats at him, but, before he confesses, Madison tells Amy first. Madison dates Ben's rival teammate, Josh. Right before their biggest swim competition, Ben is disqualified for having steroids in his urine. Ben is outraged and suspects Madison had Josh set him up. Ben confronts Josh about the drug test, revealing his suspicion. Days later, Madison accidentally calls Josh by Ben's name while they are kissing in a car. Josh realizes that Madison's obsession with Ben is real and tells her off. Ben tries to tell Amy everything, but she doesn‚Äôt believe him. The next day, Ben goes to the pool, where he finds Josh dead. The police suspect that Ben is to blame for Josh's murder. To prove his innocence, Ben breaks into Madison's room to find evidence. He discovers a bottle of steroids and a creepy shrine of his personal belongings she has been secretly stashing. Christopher warns Ben of a similar case regarding a man named Jake Donnelly. When Ben visits Jake in the hospital, a nurse tells him that Jake's girlfriend Madison survived the crash. Madison disguises herself as Ben and steals his car. She follows Amy home from school and runs Amy off the road, and again Ben is framed for the crime. That night at the hospital, Ben and a few friends record as Madison confesses her crime and intentions, resulting in Madison's arrest. She escapes custody by stealing an officer's gun and shooting the two policemen escorting her. She enters Ben's house and forcibly takes Amy to the school's swimming pool. As Ben watches, Madison throws a handcuffed and chairbound Amy into the pool. Madison attacks them with the handle of a pool cleaner, and Ben grabs one end, pulling her into the pool. As Madison does not know how to swim, she drowns while Ben frees the drowned Amy from her handcuffs and carries her out of the pool. Ben resuscitates Amy via artificial respiration by mouth. Later, at a swim meet, Ben is a spectator. He goes outside to his car, where he and Amy kiss and drive away.

The worldwide box office gross was $34.4 million; nearly a third of that came from its first-place opening weekend in the US. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 14% of 91 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.9/10. The consensus is, \\"A Fatal Attraction rip-off, Swimfan is a predictable, mediocre thriller.\\" Peter Bradshaw gave the film two stars out of five, calling it a \\"teen Fatal Attraction with an unappetising extra helping of Scream and saying it lacks \\"the sardonic wit that parts of the script had seemed initially to promise\\". Variety described it as a \\"chiller resolutely without chills, in which even the pool water always seems heated. And inasmuch as the pic never owns up to its own trashiness, it's not even enjoyable camp--like Mary Lambert's recent The In Crowd--even though there's about as much underage drinking, heavy petting and full-on sex as you can imagine this side of a very surprising PG-13 rating.\\" Soundtrack  See also  References External links  * Category:2002 films Category:2000s teen films Category:2002 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American female buddy films Category:American teen films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films about stalking Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Swimming films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films directed by John Polson ","title":"Swimfan"},{"id":"887456","text":"Adolph Heinrich Joseph Sutro (April 29, 1830 ‚Äì August 8, 1898) was a German- American engineer, politician and philanthropist who served as the 24th mayor of San Francisco from 1895 until 1897. Born a German Jew, he moved to Virginia City, Nevada and made a fortune at the Comstock Lode. Several places in San Francisco bear his name in remembrance of his life and contributions to the city.  Early life  Born to a Jewish family in Aachen, Rhine Province, Prussia (today North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany), Sutro was the oldest of eleven children of Rosa (Warendorff) and Emanuel Sutro. He spent his youth working in his father's cloth factory and at school. After his father's death, he and one of his brothers, Sali (n√© Emanuel Sali Sutro; 1827‚Äì1908), began running the cloth factory. The Prussian rebellion in 1848 caused the family to leave for America in 1850 and settle in Baltimore. Soon after, Adolph left for California and arrived in San Francisco on November 21, 1851. Adolph held multiple positions in San Francisco and eventually owned several tobacco shops. Sutro Tunnel In 1860, Sutro left San Francisco for Virginia City, Nevada, after silver was found in Comstock Lode with plans to continue selling cigars. However, he soon came up with an idea for a tunnel to drain the water from the mines to remove the threat of flooding. This idea would become known as the Sutro Tunnel. In 1865 Sutro incorporated the Sutro Tunnel Company and was granted an exclusive charter to build the tunnel by the U.S. Congress in 1866. The project encountered financial difficulties, due in part to William Ralston (1826‚Äì1875) of the Bank of California, who originally agreed to finance the project but later rescinded the offer. Over time, Sutro found other investors, including miners in the area. Sutro won miners' support after a disaster at the Yellow Jacket Mine on April 7, 1869, allowed him to lobby the Miner's Union in support of the Sutro Tunnel and construction began on October 19, 1869. According to historian Samuel Dickson (n√© Samuel Benjamin Dinkelspiel; 1889‚Äì1974), Sutro set off blasts of dynamite, leading the way for tunnel diggers\\" during the tunnel's construction The tunnel was completed in 1878 and made Sutro the King of Comstock because it could drain four million gallons of water daily and was rented by mine owners at an average of $10,000 a day. After a year of running the tunnel, issues arose between Sutro and his partners, leading to his departure in 1879. Soon after Sutro left the company, the output of Comstock Lode dropped along with stock prices.  Estate, baths, and home  Adolph Sutro & Ladies of National Medical Convention inside the Sutro Baths, June 8, 1894. His wealth was increased by large real estate investments in San Francisco, where he became an entrepreneur and public figure after returning from the Comstock in 1879. These land investments included Mount Sutro, Land's End (the area where Lincoln Park and the Cliff House are today), and Mount Davidson, which was called \\"Blue Mountain\\" at the time. Sutro in his library Sutro opened his own estate to the public and was heralded as a populist for various astute acts of public munificence, such as opening an aquarium and an elaborate and beautiful, glass-enclosed entertainment complex called Sutro Baths in the Sutro District. Though the Baths were not opened until 1896, Sutro had been developing and marketing the project for years, attempting four separate times to insulate the site from waves using sea walls, the first three of which collapsed into the Pacific. In 1896, Adolph Sutro built a new Cliff House, a seven-story Victorian Chateau, called by some \\"the Gingerbread Palace,\\" below his estate on the bluffs of Sutro Heights. This was the same year work began on the famous Sutro Baths, which included six of the largest indoor swimming pools north of the restaurant that included a museum, ice skating rink and other pleasure grounds. Great throngs of San Franciscans arrived on steam trains, bicycles, carts and horse wagons on Sunday excursions. In 1894, Sutro, in preparation for the opening of the Cliff House, bought a large part of the collection of Woodward's Gardens, a combination zoo, amusement park, aquarium, and art gallery which had closed in 1891.Peter Hartlaub, \\"Woodward's Gardens Comes to Life in New Book\\", San Francisco Chronicle (October 30, 2012) Sutro House The Baths were saltwater and springwater pools, heated to varying degrees, and surrounded by a concert hall and museums stocked with treasures that Sutro had collected in his travels and from Woodward's Gardens. The baths became very popular despite their remote location, across the open dunes to the west of the populated areas of the city. This popularity was partly due to the low entry fee for visiting the Baths and riding the excursion railroad he built to reach them. A fire destroyed the baths complex in 1966 and all that remains now are ruins. The railroad grade still exists as a walking trail along the Land's End cliffs, maintained by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Sutro managed a great increase in the value of his outlying land investments as a direct result of the development burst that his vacationers' railroad spawned. He also increased the value of his lands by planting his property at Mount Sutro with saplings of fast-growing eucalyptus. This occurred at the same time as city Supervisors granted tax-free status to \\"forested\\" lands within city limits. Small fragments of the forest still exist. The largest is at Mount Sutro, where are the property of the University of California, San Francisco, and another 19 are property of the City of San Francisco. Mayor (1894‚Äì1896) Sutro's reputation as a provider of diversions and culture for the average person led the politically weak and radical Populist Party to draft him to run for mayor on their ticket. He won on an anti-big business platform, inveighing against the tight grip that the Southern Pacific Railroad had over local businesses. According to historian Alexander Saxton: He was quickly considered a failed mayor, ill-suited for political work, and did not provide any popularity boost to the Populist party. At the time of his death, in 1898, his fortune was extensive and his legal affairs in disarray. As a result, his heirs fought bitterly over his holdings. Many of Sutro's gifts to the city of San Francisco still exist and bear his name, such as Mount Sutro, originally Mount Parnassus (a lower hill nearby is the location of the Sutro Tower), and Sutro Heights, and Sutro Heights Park. Sutro Baths became a skating rink and then was destroyed by a fire in 1966. The ruins of the baths (mostly the concrete foundations) are just north of the Cliff House. They are part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. (1894‚Äì1896) Family In 1854, Sutro married Leah Harris (maiden; 1832‚Äì1893). They had seven children: 1. Emma Laura Sutro, MD (1855‚Äì1938), who on March 27, 1883, married George Washington Merritt, MD (1855‚Äì1928) 2. Rose Victoria Sutro (1858‚Äì1942), who in 1887 married Count Pio Alberto Morbio (1849‚Äì1911).

Charles Walter Sutro (1864‚Äì1936) 6. Edgar Ernest Sutro (1866‚Äì1922) 7. Clara Angela Sutro (1867‚Äì1924), who, on December 24, 1898, in Los Angeles, married Chicago attorney William John English (1845‚Äì1926), divorced him in 1912, and on July 7, 1915, in Paris, married Count Gilbert de Choiseul-Praslin (1882‚Äì1926), grandson of the French nobleman, Charles de Choiseul-Praslin (1805‚Äì1847), and son of Marie Elizabeth Forbes (maiden; 1850‚Äì1932) ‚Äì sister of Henry de Courcy Forbes (1849‚Äì1920). Clara and Gilbert divorced in 1921. Leah filed for divorce from Adolph in 1879 and the two officially separated July 3, 1880. Shortly after Adolph's death in 1898, Clara Louisa Kluge (maiden; 1863‚Äì1943) claimed to be his widow by way of common law marriage. She retained attorney Van R. Paterson (1849‚Äì1902) and prevailed in securing financial support for her two children that she claimed Adolph had fathered: 8. Adolph Newton Sutro (1891‚Äì1981), who, in January 1926 in San Bernardino, married Olive Woodward Waibel (maiden; 1901‚Äì1979) 9. Adolphine Charlotte Sutro (1892‚Äì1974), who married Elliott Lazier Fullerton (1885‚Äì1932) A brother of Adolph, Otto Sutro (1833‚Äì1896), was an organist, conductor, and minor composer who was prominent in music in Baltimore, Maryland. Otto's daughters, Rose Laura Sutro (1870‚Äì1957) and Ottilie Sutro (1872‚Äì1970), were an internationally acclaimed piano-duo team. Another brother, Theodore Sutro (1845‚Äì1927), a New York City lawyer, married September 18, 1884, in Manhattan, Florence Sutro (n√©e Florence Edith Clinton; 1865‚Äì1906), a musician, painter, and founding President of National Federation of Women's Music Clubs.  Portrayal on TV  The actor Robert Argent played Sutro in the 1957 episode (season 5, episode 17), \\"The Man Who Was Never Licked\\" of the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. William Hudson was cast in the same episode as Lucky Baldwin, a powerful 19th century California businessman.

The film depicts Matt Sullivan, a San Francisco web designer who has chosen to abstain from any sexual contact for the duration of Lent.  Plot  Matt Sullivan lives in San Francisco with his roommate Ryan, working at a dot-com company. Matt‚Äôs obsession with his ex- girlfriend Nicole causes him sexual dysfunction with other women, which he confides to his brother John, a Catholic priest-in-training. After a disastrous attempt to fake an orgasm with a date, Matt learns that Nicole is now engaged. Hoping to resolve his issues, he vows to abstain from sexual stimulation, including masturbation, for the 40 days of Lent. On the first day of his celibacy, Matt purges his apartment of items of temptation and reminders of Nicole. At a laundromat, he befriends a stranger named Erica, despite being unable to bring himself to speak to her. Unbeknownst to Matt, his coworkers and Ryan start an office pool to bet on how long he can last, which soon spreads online. He revisits the laundromat to see Erica, who reveals she works as a ‚Äúcyber nanny‚Äù filtering internet pornagraphy. They share an emotional connection, and Matt takes Erica on a date riding the city bus, but awkwardly avoids kissing her. They both discover his coworkers‚Äô betting pool, complete with its own website. Matt tries to explain his intentions but Erica remains upset, and Matt‚Äôs boss decides to join him in celibacy. Having fallen for Matt, Erica agrees to another date, where they run into Nicole and her fianc√©; frustrated by Matt‚Äôs vow and his feelings for Nicole, Erica leaves him. Struggling with his urges, Matt is forced to endure his coworkers‚Äô attempts to sabotage him. He turns to his brother for help, but even a family dinner results in their parents discussing their own sex life. By Day 35 of Matt‚Äôs vow, the pool has reached $18,000, and a colleague convinces him to give in. Matt marches into the bathroom to masturbate, but instead discovers his boss ‚Äì who accidentally had a Viagra-spiked drink intended for Matt ‚Äì pleasuring himself in the next stall. With the entire office waiting, Matt escapes through the bathroom window and goes to Erica. They reconcile, and spend a night of intimacy together without actual intercourse. On Day 38, Matt has an inadvertent erection at work and is sent home. Nicole arrives at his apartment, having broken up with her cheating fianc√©, but Matt rejects her advances and sends her away, which only excites her more. Overhearing the bet the next day, she goes to Matt‚Äôs coworkers, adding her own $3,500 to the pot and discovering that Matt has plans to celebrate with Erica at midnight when his vow ends. On Day 40, the long- suffering Matt is unable to stop picturing women naked. He walks in on his brother kissing a nun; tormented by Matt‚Äôs exploits, John is taking a sabbatical from the priesthood. Fighting to contain himself, Matt has Ryan handcuff him to his bed, and awakens from an erotic dream to find Nicole has raped him while he was asleep, just before midnight. Arriving as Nicole is leaving, Erica assumes Matt was unfaithful and dishonored his vow, and storms out. Determined to win Erica back, Matt gives her a box of moments they had shared; he finds her at the laundromat, and they finally kiss. As they consummate their relationship in Matt‚Äôs bedroom for hours, Ryan and the coworkers wait outside and place new bets on how long he can last, until Matt kicks them all out.

Perez turned in the first draft a few months later and the film was greenlit. Thirteen months after having sold the pitch, filming began. The film was released a year-and-a-half later. In retrospect Perez noted how lucky he was that the film got made: \\"At the time I believed the film was made because of the script. However, in retrospect I believe it was made because of a confluence of a 20 completely random stars aligning. This included an influx of money at the studio from a new partnership; their recent films had been hits; young comedies like mine were connecting at the time; a few bankable actors in the age range wanted to play the lead; the executive(s) happened to like (or at least think it was commercial) the concept/script; and that the producer was hungry enough that when he hit road blocks, he found other ways to keep moving forward. I can go on, but hope this is enough to illustrate my point: the film was made because of 20 things that had nothing to do with the script.\\" The film was shot primarily in Vancouver, but also featured some San Francisco locations, including Potrero Hill, San Francisco, California.  Reception  = Critical response = On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 38% based on reviews from 134 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"As romantic comedies go, 40 Days and 40 Nights is smutty, sexist, and puerile.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 53%, based on reviews from 33 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. He praised director Michael Lehmann for raising the film above the level of sexual sitcom, through his sympathy for his characters and use of humor to examine human nature. He also credited writer Rob Perez for dialogue about sex with \\"more complexity and nuance than we expect\\". Not wanting to reveal too much Ebert explained he was dissatisfied with the ending saying \\"Nicole's entire participation is offensive and unnecessary, and that there was a sweeter and funnier way to resolve everything.\\" Variety's Todd McCarthy called it \\"A self-described abstinence comedy that is funny, sexy and silly in equal measure\\" but notes \\"had tried to deepen the film‚Äôs potentially serious themes as often as they make light of them, they might have come up with something more than the disposable farce at hand.\\" Peter Travers called it \\"a one-joke sex farce\\", and complains \\"Yup, director Michael Lehmann, far from the glory days of \\"Heathers,\\" has made a movie about a hard-on, in which he relentlessly pounds a flaccid premise.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post called the film \\"So eyeball-gougingly awful that you're tempted to give up movies for Lent.\\" = Box office = The film earned in its opening weekend $12,229,529. It earned $37,939,782 at the domestic box office and $57,152,885 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $95,146,283. = Accolades = In 2005 Empire magazine included the film on its list of \\"Worst Sex Scenes\\".

Originally called North Unst Lighthouse, it was renamed in 1964. The brothers Thomas and David Stevenson designed and built the lighthouse in 1854, originally to protect ships during the Crimean War. First lit on 1 January 1858, it stands high, has 103 steps to the top, and is Britain's most northerly lighthouse. The light beam flashes white every 20 seconds, with a nominal range of . In March 1995 it was fully automated.Muckle Flugga History Thomas's son Robert Louis Stevenson, the writer, visited it as a young man. As a result, Unst became his inspiration for the map of \\"Treasure Island\\". The lighthouse was served by the Grace Darling which was launched from the boat house below the lighthouse shore station in Burrafirth. Supplies were winched up by the blondin cable hoist to the courtyard, from the boat in a natural cleft of the rocks that provides a degree of harbourage. This lighthouse was also used as a setting for the wartime comedy Back-Room Boy. History In 1851 it was decided to build a lighthouse on north Unst but, because of difficulties in determining the exact location, nothing had been done by the start of 1854. During the Crimean War, the government urged the commissioners to set up a light on Muckle Flugga to protect Her Majesty's ships. A temporary lighthouse high was built above sea level and lit on 11 October 1854. It was thought to be high and safe enough to withstand the elements, but when winter storms began waves broke heavily on the tower and burst open the door to the living quarters. The principal keeper reported that of stone dyke had been broken down, and the keepers had no dry place to sit or sleep. Plans were made for a higher and more permanent lighthouse, but there were still disagreements about where to locate it, Muckle Flugga or Lamba Ness. The orders to start the work on the new Muckle Flugga tower were finally given in June 1855. The lighthouse's original name was \\"North Unst\\", but in 1964 that was changed to \\"Muckle Flugga\\".Shetlopedia - The Shetland Encyclopedia  Lighthouse keepers  Russell Powell 1977-1990 Thomas J. M. Hutchison 1949-1962 Muckle Flugga Shore Station Muckle Flugga was one of the few lighthouses in Scotland which had a separate shore station that served as accommodation for the lighthouse keepers when they were off duty (similar to Sule Skerry and its shore station in Stromness, Orkney). The shore station was sold off when the lighthouse was automated.

Schule's record-setting time was 9-4/5 seconds at an indoor event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 5, 1904. In June 1904, the University of Michigan's Athletic Board of Control ruled that Schule was no longer eligible to compete for the school in intercollegiate athletics, because he had already competed for four years. In 2008, Schule was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Track & Field Hall of Fame. 1904 Summer Olympics Schule competed for the United States as a hurdler at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. He won the gold medal in the 110 meter hurdle event with a time of 16.0 seconds, beating fellow American Thaddeus Shideler by two yards. Schule also competed in the 200 metre hurdles event and finished fifth. The 1904 Summer Olympics have been called the \\"Michigan Olympics\\" due to the fact that University of Michigan athletes (including Schule, shot putter Ralph Rose, sprinter Archie Hahn, and pole vaulter Charles Dvorak) won ten medals, including six gold medals. Coaching career After competing in the 1904 Olympics, Schule was employed as an assayer and chemist in Utah from 1904 to 1905. In 1905, he was hired at the director of the gymnasium at the University of Montana in Missoula, Montana. He also served as an instructor and coach at the University of Montana. He was the head football coach from 1905 to 1906 and the head basketball coach from 1905 to 1907. In two season as the head football coach, Schule compiled a record of 4-7 as his teams were outscored by a combined total of 166 to 150. Later years At the time of the 1910 United States Census, Schule was living in Washington Township, Buchanan County, Missouri.

Ottawa Citizen, September 2, 1995. Background For the previous ten years, the CBC's nightly newscast, The National, had aired at 10 p.m., and was followed by a 40-minute newsmagazine package called The Journal, which was hosted by Barbara Frum. However, following Frum's death in early 1992, the CBC took the opportunity to revamp its flagship newscast. The CBC's live coverage of the Charlottetown Accord referendum results on October 26, 1992 effectively acted as a soft launch for the show,\\"The News at Nine; CBC's new Prime Time News goes up against the U.S. networks' slickest hits\\". The Gazette, October 31, 1992. which formally debuted on November 2. With Peter Mansbridge and Pamela Wallin as equal cohosts of a package which replaced both The National and The Journal, Prime Time News combined news and Journal-style features into a single integrated program which aired at 9 p.m.\\"Debut of Prime Time News shakes up entire CBC lineup\\". The Gazette, November 2, 19912. Despite the change, The National was not entirely discontinued; concurrently with the change on the main network, the CBC's separate all-news channel CBC Newsworld adopted the title for its own prime time news program.\\"Newsworld is big winner after changes at CBC news\\". The Gazette, December 12, 1992. The program's choice of name also created a conflict with CBC Radio's Prime Time, whose host Geoff Pevere spoke out against the potential confusion caused by the television and radio programs having such similar names.\\"The Prime of their lives\\". The Globe and Mail, October 31, 1992. Ratings performance Although ratings were strong at first, with its first week seeing a full 30 per cent improvement over The National's average ratings during the previous year,\\"Prime Time News debut has ratings up 30% over National\\". Ottawa Citizen, November 5, 1992. the approach proved unpopular, both within the CBC and with network audiences and critics. The National had been produced by the CBC's news department, while The Journal belonged to current affairs;Knowlton Nash, Prime Time at Ten (McClelland & Stewart, 1987), . bringing the two departments together was fractious, and the on-air rapport between Wallin and Mansbridge was visibly tense at times. Critics especially lambasted the debut episode, whose lead story was the last full day of the 1992 United States presidential election, as \\"an uninspiring collection of newsreading, charts and cutaways to foreign correspondents\\" more reminiscent of a local television station than a national network with the high reputation of CBC News,\\"CBC launches a Prime Time \`turkey\`\\". Calgary Herald, November 3, 1992. and viewer response to the new program's format was highly unfavourable.\\"Ratings high but viewers cool to CBC news debut\\". Edmonton Journal, November 6, 1992. Also, because the program aired at 9 p.m., it was competing in one of the most heavily watched timeslots on the commercial networks. Although The National and The Journal had faced commercial competition at 10 p.m., they had been much more successful at carving out their own niche because in that time slot, almost all of the commercial networks were airing drama series. At 9 p.m., Prime Time News had to compete with popular sitcoms such as Cheers, Frasier, Seinfeld and Murphy Brown. As a result, Prime Time News rapidly dropped off in the ratings, seeing a 12 per cent viewership decline after its first week alone;\\"CTV lures audience and anchor from CBC; CTV News ratings up 40 per cent since CBC's Prime Time News debut\\". Ottawa Citizen, November 21, 1992. by the end of the first month ratings were lower than The National.\\"CBC's news show suffering\\". The Globe and Mail, November 24, 1992. CTV National News concurrently saw its ratings jump 40 per cent, overtaking the CBC in national newscast ratings for the first time in its history,\\"As viewers drift off, CBC sails rough seas\\". The Globe and Mail, December 27, 1993. and CBC Newsworld's edition of The National saw viewership gains of 30 per cent over that network's prior prime time lineup, and itself sometimes garnered higher ratings than Prime Time News. The shift also resulted in significant ratings declines for several other programs, including Man Alive and The Nature of Things, whose timeslots had been shifted to accommodate the new program.\\"CBC repositioning turning off viewers\\". The Globe and Mail, December 10, 1992. Format revisions In the fall of 1994, Prime Time News returned to the 10 p.m. time slot, and to a format closer to the old National and Journal.\\"CBC turns back the clock on nightly newscast\\". Edmonton Journal, September 7, 1994. Mansbridge again became the sole anchor of the news portion of the show, and Wallin became the host of a magazine segment very similar to The Journal. However, the show retained the name Prime Time News for the 1994‚Äì1995 television season, and Wallin sometimes appeared as substitute anchor of the main news portion when Mansbridge was absent. Ratings recovered significantly following this shift;\\"Prime Time News reclaiming audience\\". Toronto Star, December 29, 1994. by December, the show was regularly drawing fully 95 per cent of The National's former audience.

Edmonton Journal, May 26, 1995. and was succeeded by Hana Gartner in June.Greg Quill, \\"CBC picks Gartner to replace Wallin\\". Toronto Star, June 3, 1995. In the fall the newscast officially reverted to the name The National, while the magazine segment became The National Magazine. This format remained in place until The National was again re-launched as a one-hour newscast in early 2001.

WP morphology denies that morphemes are signs (form-content pairs). Instead, inflections are stem modifications which serve as exponents of morphological feature sets. The theory takes paradigms as a central notion. Instead of stating rules to combine morphemes into word- forms, or to generate word-forms from stems, word-based morphology states generalizations that hold between the forms of inflectional paradigms. The major point behind this approach is that many such generalizations are hard to state with either of the other approaches. The examples are usually drawn from fusional languages, where a given \\"piece\\" of a word, which a morpheme-based theory would call an inflectional morpheme, corresponds to a combination of grammatical categories, for example, \\"third person plural.\\" Morpheme-based theories analyze such cases by associating a single morpheme with two categories. Item-and-Process theories, on the other hand, often break down in cases like these, because they all too often assume that there will be two separate rules here, one for third person, and the other for plural, but the distinction between them turns out to be artificial. Word-and-Paradigm approaches treat these as whole words that are related to each other by analogical rules. Words can be categorized based on the pattern they fit into. This applies both to existing words and to new ones. Application of a pattern different from the one that has been used historically can give rise to a new word, such as older replacing elder (where older follows the normal pattern of adjectival comparatives) and cows replacing kine (where cows fits the regular pattern of plural formation). While a Word-and-Paradigm approach can explain this easily, other approaches have difficulty with phenomena such as this.

He is generally considered to be one of the major Hungarian writers of the 20th century. Life and career Szerb was born in 1901 to assimilated Jewish parents in Budapest, but baptized Catholic. He studied Hungarian, German and later English, obtaining a doctorate in 1924. From 1924 to 1929 he lived in France and Italy, also spending a year in London, England, from 1929 to 1930. As a student, he published essays on Georg Trakl and Stefan George, and quickly established a formidable reputation as a scholar, writing erudite studies of William Blake and Henrik Ibsen among other works. Elected President of the Hungarian Literary Academy in 1933, aged just 32, he published his first novel, The Pendragon Legend (which draws upon his personal experience of living in Britain) the following year. His second and best-known work, (Journey by Moonlight) came out in 1937. He was made a Professor of Literature at the University of Szeged the same year. He was twice awarded the Baumgarten Prize, in 1935 and 1937. Szerb also translated books from English, French, and Italian, including works by Anatole France, P. G. Wodehouse, and Hugh Walpole. In 1941 he published a History of World Literature which continues to be authoritative today. He also published a volume on the theory of the novel and a book about the history of Hungarian literature. Given numerous chances to escape anti-Semitic persecution (as late as 1944), he chose to remain in Hungary, where his last novel, a Pirandellian fantasy about a king staging a coup against himself, then having to impersonate himself, Oliver VII, was published in 1942. It was passed off as a translation from the English, as no 'Jewish' work could be printed at the time. During the 1940s, Szerb faced increasing hostility due to his Jewish background. In 1943, Szerb's History of World Literature was put on a list of forbidden works. During the period of Communist rule, it would also be censored, with the chapter on Soviet literature redacted, and the full version would only be available again in 1990. Szerb was deported to a concentration camp in Balf late in 1944. Admirers of his attempted to save him with falsified papers, but Szerb turned them down, wanting to share the fate of his generation. He was beaten to death there in January 1945, at the age of 43. He was survived by his wife, Kl√°ra B√°lint, who died in 1992.  Work  Szerb is best known for his academic works on literature. In the ten years before the Second World War, he wrote two monumental works of literary criticism, characterized by a brilliant and ironic style intended for an educated reader rather than an academic public. In addition, Szerb wrote novellas and novels that still attract the attention of the reading public. The Pendragon Legend, Traveler and the Moonlight and The Queen's Necklace, for instance, fuse within the plot the aims of the literary critic with the aims of the novel writer. The author gives importance to the exotic in these novels, with a meta-literary outlook. In these three novels, the stage of the narrative action is always a Western European country: leaving quotidian Hungary allows the writer to transfigure the actions of his characters. =The Pendragon Legend= In his first novel, The Pendragon Legend, Szerb offers to his readers a representation of the United Kingdom and its inhabitants. England and, in particular, London, hosted Szerb for a year and not only suggested to him new and interesting directions for his research, but also offered him the background for his first novel. The Pendragon Legend is a detective story that begins in the British Museum and finishes in a Welsh castle. The author provides a non-native's look at the country, in a way that is consistent with the parody genre. In The Quest for the Miraculous: Survey and Problematic in the Modern Novel, Szerb claims that among the literary genres he prefers the fantasy novel. It fuses the quotidian details of everyday life with the fantastic feats that he calls ‚Äúthe miracle‚Äù. In the case of The Pendragon Legend, this allows the reader a cathartic experience through the adventures of the Hungarian philologist who serves as the protagonist of the novel. =Traveler and the Moonlight or Journey By Moonlight= , literally, Passenger (or Traveler) and the Moonlight, published in 1937, focuses on the development of the main character, Mih√°ly - a bright and romantic, albeit conflicted, young man who sets off for a honeymoon in Italy with his new wife, Erzsi. Mih√°ly quickly reveals his bizarre childhood experiences to her over a bottle of wine, alluding to a set of seemingly unresolved longings for eroticism and death which Erzsi seems to only vaguely comprehend. The plainspoken disharmony between the newlyweds leads to Mih√°ly's detached self-recognition: he is not ready to be Erzsi's husband. He then leaves his wife for his own journey through the Italian countryside and eventually Rome - figuratively tracing the sparkling fanaticisms of his juvenile imagination, even rekindling bonds with changed (and some unchanged) childhood friends - all among the impressive foreign landscapes and peculiar liveliness of its inhabitants. Szerb celebrates the exotic cult of Italy, the leitmotif of thousands of writers from the past and present, relaying his own travel impressions of Italy though the mind of his eccentric protagonist, Mih√°ly. Szerb explores the altogether interrelatedness of love and youthfulness within bourgeois society. =The Third Tower= Szerb also published an interesting diary, The Third Tower, recounting his travels to the cities in the north of Italy - Venice, Bologna, Ravenna. Before going back home, he visited San Marino, Europe's oldest state, and Montale (San Marino) inspired the title of the book. The diary is divided into paragraphs which alternate descriptions with his personal thoughts.

He is estimated to have had a peak net worth of around US$4 billion in the early 1980s.  Family and education  Khashoggi was born in Mecca, to Mohammad Khashoggi, who was King Abdul Aziz Al Saud's personal doctor. His family is of Turkish origin, although Khashoggi himself also said that he had a Jewish grandfather. Adnan Khashoggi's sister was author Samira Khashoggi who married businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed and was the mother of Dodi Fayed. Another sister, Soheir Khashoggi, is a well-known Arab novelist (Mirage, Nadia's Song, Mosaic). He was an uncle of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi was educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and the American universities California State University, Chico, Ohio State University, and Stanford University. Adnan Khashoggi left his studies in order to seek his fortune in business. Khashoggi's private jet Khashoggi's super-yacht the Nabila, later sold to Donald Trump  Business career  Khashoggi's early years were spent among some of Saudi Arabia's most influential figures. \\"While attending school he met Hussein bin Talal, the future King of Jordan. It was at school that Khashoggi first learned the commercial value of facilitating a deal, bringing together a Libyan classmate whose father wanted to import towels with an Egyptian classmate whose father manufactured towels, earning US$1,000 for the introduction. Khashoggi's subsequent education at university would serve as a launchpad for his commercial career.\\" In one of his first big deals, a large construction company was experiencing difficulties with the trucks that it used on the shifting desert sands. Khashoggi, using money given to him by his father for a car, bought a number of Kenworth trucks, whose wide wheels made traversing the desert considerably easier. Khashoggi made his first US$250,000 leasing the trucks to the construction company, and became the Saudi Arabia-based agent for Kenworth. In the 1960s and 1970s, Khashoggi helped bring together Western companies and the Saudi Arabian Government to satisfy its infrastructure and defense needs. Between 1970 and 1975, Lockheed paid Khashoggi $106 million in commissions. His commissions started at 2.5% and eventually rose to as much as 15%. Khashoggi \\"became for all practical purposes a marketing arm of Lockheed. Khashoggi would provide not only an entr√©e but strategy, constant advice, and analysis\\", according to Max Helzel, then vice president of Lockheed's international marketing. A commercial pioneer, he established companies in Switzerland and Liechtenstein to handle his commissions as well as developing contacts with notables such as CIA officers James H. Critchfield and Kim Roosevelt and United States businessman Bebe Rebozo, a close associate of U.S. President Richard Nixon. His yacht, the Nabila, was the largest in the world at the time and was used in the James Bond film Never Say Never Again. After Khashoggi ran into financial problems he sold the yacht to the Sultan of Brunei, who in turn sold it for $29 million to Donald Trump, who sold it for $20 million to Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal as part of a deal to keep his Taj Mahal casino out of bankruptcy. Khashoggi headed a company called Triad International Holding Company which among other things built the Triad Center in Salt Lake City, which later went bankrupt. He was famed as an arms dealer, brokering deals between US firms and the Saudi government, most actively in the 1960s and 1970s. In the documentary series The Mayfair Set, Saudi author Said Aburish states that one of Khashoggi's first weapons deals was providing David Stirling with weapons for a covert mission in Yemen during the Aden Emergency in 1963. Among his overseas clients were defense contractors Lockheed Corporation (now Lockheed Martin Corporation), Raytheon, Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation and Northrop Corporation (the last two of which have now merged into Northrop Grumman).  Triad International  Triad International is a multi-national private investment corporation that was owned by Khashoggi. Its investments include many notable properties and businesses throughout the world. The company consisted of subsidiary companies, including Triad Management, Triad Properties, Triad Energy, Triad Technology, and Triad Financial resources. Khashoggi's yacht Khalidia The Global span of the businesses prompted the creation by the Khashoggi family of a board-game called Triopoly which was modeled after the classic game of Monopoly. The various game tiles represented properties and companies owned by Khashoggi and his Triad corporation. The game was manufactured and given to family and friends. Triad International was formed in the early 1960s and as it grew spanned five continents. The company holdings included hotels, shopping centers, banks, oil refineries, a computer manufacturer, a gold mine, construction companies, car and truck franchises, and a professional sports team, the Utah Jazz. Khashoggi's custom board game of his properties The company was headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland with its subsidiary companies located in the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi, through Triad, owned the Mount Kenya Safari Club, known as Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a several hundred acre reserve at the foot of Mount Kenya, San Francisco Town Center East, US; a $250 million property; Long Beach Edgington Oil a $250 million per year oil refinery in the US; ATV computer systems, Santa Ana, Arizona, US; Colorado Land & Cattle company, Security National bank in Walnut Creek, California, US, Barrick gold mine in Toronto, Canada; Saudi Arabian Kenworth, Chrysler and Fiat car and truck dealerships; the National Gypsum company in Saudi Arabia, and Sahuaro Petroleum in Phoenix, Arizona, US. The company also had major financial interests in Lloyd's of London; The Manera company; Las Brisas Resort in Acapulco, Mexico; The Houston Galleria; National car rental company; Pyramid Oasis in Cairo, Egypt; Travel Lodge Australia; Pacific Harbor hotel in Fiji; Beirut Riyadh bank; and the bank of Contra Costa. Khashoggi's Triad real estate holdings included private residences in Beirut, Jeddah, Riyadh, Geneva, Cairo, Salt Lake City, Utah, Cone Ranch, Florida, Rome, Italy, Paris and Cannes, London, and a multi-floor penthouse in Olympic towers in New York. Khashoggi also owned several private jets, and super-yachts through Triad, including a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 and DC-9, three Boeing 727s, and several smaller business jets and helicopters. His three super-yachts, the Nabila, the Mohammadia, and the Khalida, were named after his children, Nabila, Mohammed, and Khalid.  Iran‚ÄìContra affair  Khashoggi was implicated in the Iran‚ÄìContra affair as a key middleman in the arms-for- hostages exchange along with Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar and, in a complex series of events, was found to have borrowed money for these arms purchases from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) with Saudi and United States backing. His role in the affair created a related controversy when Khashoggi donated millions to the American University in Washington, DC to build a sports arena which would bear his name. Khashoggi was a member of the university's board of trustees from 1983 until his indictment on fraud and other charges in May 1989. Khashoggi was \\"principal foreign agent\\" of the United States and helped establish the supranational intelligence partnership known as the Safari Club.  Imelda Marcos affair  Khashoggi's DC-9 jet and helicopter piloted by Karim Khashoggi In 1988, Khashoggi was arrested in Switzerland, accused of concealing funds, and held for three months. Khashoggi stopped fighting extradition when the U.S. prosecutors reduced the charges to obstruction of justice and mail fraud and dropped the more serious charges of racketeering and conspiracy. In 1990, a United States federal jury in Manhattan acquitted Khashoggi and Imelda Marcos, widow of the exiled Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, of racketeering and fraud.  Media  After Dark in 1991 In 1991 Khashoggi made an extended appearance on the British television programme After Dark, alongside, among others, former Prime Minister Edward Heath and Lord Weidenfeld.Website of production company Open Media Khashoggi also appeared in Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous in 1985 with host Robin Leach which showcased Khashoggi's extravagant lifestyle. During his peak, Khashoggi was a well-known figure who frequently appeared in the press and media. He also appeared in various television shows, newspapers, and notable magazine covers such as Time (magazine) and The Washington Post.

It lies in the steep valley of the West Webburn River about southwest of the village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor. Its row of picturesque thatched cottages, climbing up a steep hill, are often the subject of calendars and postcards. It also has a mill and old bakehouse, converted to a house in 1976. Ponsworthy House, built c.1800, has a porch with Doric columns of granite. At the foot of the hill is the ‚ÄòPonsworthy Splash‚Äô, where vehicles must drive through a small stream which runs across the road. The village is also well known for Ponsworthy Bridge over the West Webburn River. It has a single arch and contains a stone engraved with the dates 1666 and 1792 - believed to be when repairs were carried out. It was further repaired in 1911. The bridge has a width restriction, which is one of the reasons the village is so quiet, for it is impassable to modern coaches.

Formed by vocalist James \\"Buddy\\" Nielsen, drummer Dan Trapp, guitarists Garrett Zablocki and Dave Miller, and bassist James Gill (later replaced shortly by Mike Glita); the band has seen many lineup changes, with Nielsen being the only consistent member. The lineup currently consists of Nielsen, bassist/guitarist Gavin Caswell and drummer Steve Carey, together with bassist Greg Styliades and guitarist Jason Milbank. The band has released seven studio albums, Let It Enfold You, Still Searching, Life Is Not a Waiting Room, The Fire, Renacer, Pull the Thorns from Your Heart and If There Is Light, It Will Find You. In addition, the band has two EPs, From the Depths of Dreams and In Your Absence.  History  = Formation and From the Depths of Dreams EP (2002‚Äì2003) = Senses Fail's beginnings started in October 2001 after Nielsen posted an advertisement on the Internet to recruit members for the band. The advertisement attracted attention from Garrett Zablocki, who then began writing with Nielsen. Later Zablocki contacted Dave Miller to join the band who also brought along his friend, James Gill. After a short time with another drummer the band came across Dan Trapp, who was only 14-years-old at the time. Before the band signed to Drive- Thru Records, James Gill was kicked out of the band due to irreconcilable differences; he was replaced by former Tokyo Rose drummer Mike Glita. Nielsen explained the band name, stating: \\"In Hinduism, they believe that being alive is hell, and the only way to reach Nirvana is to ultimately have no attachments to anything. So, people go out and live in the middle of the woods and they don't eat and don't drink. They just meditate because they've reached such a high level where they're not attached to love, relationships or anything. And if you want to reach the highest level of being and see God, you have to have all your senses fail.\\" Building a local fan base by playing any gig they could find from skate parks and clubs to churches, they soon entered the studio and started to record. Their first release, From the Depths of Dreams, was a six-track EP that was originally released on ECA Records on August 16, 2002. It originally started as two three-song demo CDs, but was later joined together to make one release by producer John Naclerio. The independent release did very well and caught the attention of some record labels. They signed to Drive-Thru Records, and reissued their EP on April 29, 2003 with two extra tracks, remastering, and new cover art. The b-side \\"Bastard Son\\" was also recorded during this time. The release saw much success, and sold enough copies to peak at No. 144 on the Billboard chart.[ Senses Fail Charting on Allmusic] Retrieved on May 22, 2008 In support of the EP, Senses Fail toured with such bands as The Used, Millencolin, The Starting Line, and Drive-Thru labelmates Finch. = Let It Enfold You (2004‚Äì2005) = Senses Fail started working on their debut album, Let It Enfold You in April 2003. During this time, lead singer and songwriter Buddy Nielsen was 18‚Äì19 years old. They worked with producer Steve Evetts (Saves the Day, A Static Lullaby, Every Time I Die) on their new label Vagrant Records. The lyrics were derived from a wide variety of sources. The title of the album was taken from a poem written by Charles Bukowski, the song \\"Irony of Dying on Your Birthday\\" is about the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell, and parts of the song \\"Slow Dance\\" include lines of the Dao De Jing. Nielsen stated that, \\"We just love making music and writing good songs. I feel like I've got a lot more to say and we've got a lot more to contribute. But even if things ended tomorrow, we've gotten 10 times further than we ever expected to get and that makes us feel like we've succeeded regardless of what happens from here on.\\" Let It Enfold You was released on September 7, 2004 on Vagrant and Drive Thru Records.[ Senses Fail Biotesla was hegraphy on Allmusic] Retrieved on May 22, 2008 The album was certified gold by the RIAA, and has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide. Let It Enfold You saw the release of two singles: \\"Buried a Lie\\" and \\"Rum Is for Drinking, Not for Burning.\\" The music video for \\"Buried a Lie\\" was filmed on the set of the soap opera Guiding Light. Nielsen's mother, who shot the video, used to act in the show. The release of the video started attracting mainstream success for the band. During this period, Senses Fail were featured in magazines such as Kerrang!, Rolling Stone, Spin and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press. The band toured extensively in support of the release. They were added to Warped Tour in 2004, 2005, and 2006, and 2009, and played on the main stage for the 2005 and 2006 editions of the tour. They were also included on the first Taste of Chaos tour in 2005 with such notable acts as The Used, My Chemical Romance, and Killswitch Engage. They also headlined a few tours of their own during this time with The Early November from Drive Thru and Emanuel from Vagrant. The album was reissued in November 2005 with bonus tracks and new album art.

He was replaced by Heath Saraceno, previously the guitarist and vocalist of the band Midtown. Miller started his own record label called DMI (Dave Miller Industries) in September 2006. The song \\"Lady in a Blue Dress,\\" from this album, was released as a downloadable track on the Rock Band Network on March 4, 2010. = Still Searching (2006‚Äì2007) = Senses Fail in 2011 After taking a break from touring, and acquiring a new lineup, Senses Fail began to write their second studio album. The new album, titled Still Searching was produced by Brian McTernan (Thrice, Cave In) and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. This album eased up on the aggression on previous albums and showed more emotion. On the subject of the new songs, Nielsen explained, \\"I like my lyrics to be open to interpretation, but I didn‚Äôt want to paint pictures of things no one was going to understand; I want our fans to be able to relate. At some point, we all start examining our lives. If you don‚Äôt, there‚Äôs something wrong with you.\\" In support of the new album, the band toured on the Taste of Chaos again.

On June 30, 2009, it was announced that guitarist Heath Saraceno would be leaving the band after the 2009 Warped Tour, stating: \\"I've shared many great times with these guys over the past four years or so. We've made two records I'm very proud of, toured the world and the States countless times, and I've made friends with people I would not have met otherwise. These guys from Jersey (and Atlanta by way of Florida) have turned into some of my closest friends, and I will miss seeing them as often as I've been able to.\\" He was replaced by Zack Roach. = The Fire (2010) = Buddy Nielsen performing at the Social in April 2013 The band began recording their new album, titled The Fire, at Salad Days Studio with Brian McTernan in June 2010 hoping to release later that year.

History Langensalza in 1750. The town was first mentioned in historical records ca. 932, as a village named \\"Salzaha\\". The town's name was changed to Langensalza ca. 1578, and \\"Bad\\" (\\"Spa\\") added to the name in 1956. In 1075, Langensalza was the site of a battle, in which Emperor Henry IV won over the rebelling Saxons and Thuringians. The town was plundered and damaged by fires during the Thirty Years' War (c. 1632). Fires again destroyed large parts of the town in 1711, including complete destruction of the town hall, which was rebuilt between 1742 and 1752. War again affected the town between 1756 and 1763, during the Seven Years' War; it was the scene of a battle in February 1761. In 1815 Langensalza became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony. In 1866 it was again the site of a battle between Prussia and Hanover during the Austro-Prussian War. American troops occupied the town in 1945. Main sights Langensalza is something of a tourist spot, with a well-preserved medieval old town, a number of themed public gardens and a thermal spa bath.https://www.badlangensalza.de/en/ Sulphur springs were discovered in 1811 and opened to the public as a curative bath in 1812. A new version of the public sulphur bath was opened in 1928. Salt and mineral water springs were discovered in 1996, which prompted the opening of many new curative facilities. Today a modern thermal bath attracts many visitors. Bad Langensalza contains a Botanical Garden, along with a Rose Garden, a Magnolia Garden and an Arboretum. It is one of the few European towns with an authentic Japanese Garden. Bad Langensalza is also close to the Hainich National Park, Germany's oldest deciduous forest. The town is on the German Timber-Frame Road (Fachwerkstra√üe) and is notable for the number of well-preserved medieval half-timbered (Fachwerk) houses. Travertine stone has been mined in the town since medieval times, and is still carved there today. It forms the distinctive white stonework of the old town. Travertine from Bad Langensalza was used in one of the most famous works of modern architecture, the Barcelona Pavilion by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Cultural The then Augustinian monk Martin Luther visited Langensalza's Augustinian Cloister in 1516 in his role as District Vicar. As a result the town is now on the Luther Trail (Lutherweg). The poet Klopstock lived in Langensalza between 1748 and 1750, where he composed some of his most famous odes. His sumptuous house is still standing in the Salzstra√üe. The poet Novalis lived for a time in Langensalza in 1796 whilst studying chemistry under Johann Christian Wiegleb at his house in the Markstra√üe. Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, the most eminent German physician of the 19th Century, was born in Langensalza. He is buried in the famous Dorotheenstadt Cemetery in Berlin.

He was also a lawyer, practicing in the state of New York from 1929 to 1941. During and after World War II, he held several positions in the United States government, including Chief Intelligence Officer at the US Embassy in London, Special Assistant to the Undersecretary of War, and Counsel to the US Senate Committee on Atomic Energy. In the latter capacity, he helped to draft the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. He became a member of the board of editors for Scientific American beginning in 1948. He is also credited for coining and first describing the mathematical concept \\"googol\\" in his book (co-authored by Edward Kasner) Mathematics and The Imagination.  Author  In 1940 Newman wrote (with Edward Kasner) Mathematics and the Imagination in which he identified the mathematical concept of a very large but finite number, which he called \\"googol\\" and another large number called \\"googolplex\\" ‚Äî this was the first time this number, and this term, were identified. In 1942 Newman wrote The Tools of War, which was an illustrated examination of warfare. In 1948 he published The control of atomic energy. In 1955 he wrote What is Science and in 1956 he published The World of Mathematics, a four volume library on the literature of mathematics from A'h-mos√© the Scribe to Albert Einstein, presented with commentaries and notes (1956). The four volume series covers many branches of mathematics and represents a 15-year effort by Newman to collect what he felt were the most important essays in the field. With essays ranging from a biography of Srinivasa Ramanujan by Newman to Bertrand Russell's Definition of Number, the series is often praised as suitable for any level of mathematical skill. The series has been reprinted several times by various publishers. Newman also wrote G√∂del's Proof (1958) with Ernest Nagel, presenting the main results of G√∂del's incompleteness theorem and the mathematical work and philosophies leading up to its discovery in a more accessible manner. This book inspired Douglas Hofstadter to take up the study of mathematical logic, write his famous book G√∂del, Escher, Bach, and prepare a second edition of G√∂del's Proof, published in 2002. In 1961 Newman wrote Science and Sensibility, in 1962 The Rule of Folly and in 1963 The Harper Encyclopedia of Science. References * * External links *\\"Where Are You When I Need You, James R.

Its first public release was version 0.28. The current BitComet logo has been used since version 0.50. Features The BitComet program is a multi-threaded multi-protocol hybrid download manager and BitTorrent peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing application. It supports simultaneous download tasks. To complete a particular download, it can draw parts of files from many sources across different P2P and client‚Äìserver protocols. BitComet's main features include an embedded Internet Explorer window to let users search for torrents. Along with the features typical of contemporary BitTorrent clients, it supports UPnP gateway configuration, bandwidth scheduling, Webseeding, selecting only certain files for download inside a torrent package, NAT traversal (removed in v.1.03), Peer Exchange (in older versions, using a proprietary protocol and starting with v.1.19 also by using the Extension Protocol, implementing a PEX mechanism compatible with ŒºTorrent / Mainline PEX), Initial-Seeding (Super-Seeding) and support for Magnet Links. When downloading, BitComet provides the option to prioritize the first and last portions of media files so that files may be previewed before they are completely downloaded. It also has a \\"Preview Download Mode\\" in which all pieces of the torrent will be, basically, downloaded sequentially thus allowing the user to play a media file while downloading (provided that the downloading speed and piece availability stay ahead of playing bitrate). BitComet also allows users to share their .torrent files, on a searchable P2P network, with other BitComet users through the torrent sharing feature, named \\"Torrent Share\\" in previous versions and renamed to \\"Torrent Exchange\\" since v.1.17. BitComet uses the Kademlia (mainline) DHT to operate even when the tracker is offline. BitComet is capable of downloading files over HTTP and FTP as well as bittorrent, and it includes download plugins for Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Maxthon. An optional plugin is available to connect to the eD2K network. The plugin is a modified version of the GPL eMule program. When installed, it connects automatically to a server. 200px The software includes an application to play Flash Video files (.flv and .swf files). In February 2011, BitComet launched anonymous downloading feature to its VIP customers. Using this feature, downloads will be handled by BitComet VIP servers and the real IP address of the user will be hidden. =Optional standalone software= BitComet.com offers a BitTorrent tracker available for download from the official site. The FLV player program can also be downloaded separately and used independently of the BitComet software. Search engine The search site is google.atcomet.com Controversy and criticism =Hash reporting= Since version 0.86 BitComet includes discussion and stat-tracking features which send information about torrents to the Bitcomet.com servers, including the torrent hash. =DHT exploit= During version 0.60, BitComet received bad publicity because its implementation of the DHT feature, which was new at the time, could be exploited to ignore the private flag of a tracker. This allowed users to avoid download and upload ratio restrictions, which are common on private trackers. Some private trackers responded to this by blacklisting version 0.60. BitComet developer RnySmile reverted the client back to version 0.59 in response to the blacklisting. The DHT exploit was fixed in version 0.61. =Padding files= Starting with version 0.85 (from early 2007), BitComet added a non-standard option to its torrent maker that ensures that no two data files in a multi-file torrent occupy the same BitTorrent \\"piece.\\" To accomplish this, BitComet includes in the torrent a collection of empty \\"padding\\" files which houses the remainder of each file's last \\"piece\\". While these files are transparent to BitComet users, they damage the performance of other clients, because peers must devote resources and bandwidth to the padding files, with no benefit to the non-BitComet users. These files can constitute up to 10% of the total data transferred, creating a substantial drain on the swarm. BitComet developers added this feature to allow support of a feature called Long-Term Seeding in which the BitComet client can download files from other BitComet clients who have an identical file but not from the same torrent. It also allows the downloading of individual files from other non torrent sources like ED2K links. The addition of the padding file ensures that a complete version of the file can be obtained rather than being unable to complete the relevant file or last \\"piece\\" Creation of padding files has been enabled by default since version 0.85, and as of version 1.36 is still enabled by default. =FileHippo controversy= The download site FileHippo ceased carrying new versions of BitComet in April 2008, with this announcement. > As of April 2008 FileHippo will no longer be updating BitComet. As they have > copied the FileHippo site text, files, images and update checker and are > passing it off as original work. We recommend you use a different more > reputable torrent client such as uTorrent. This occurred after FileHippo reportedly noticed that the design and code of the AppHit.com site was very similar with the one FileHippo used, copying not only icons, but text from FileHippo's website and FileHippo's own original update checking software. Because AppHit and BitComet were contractual partners, FileHippo decided to stop carrying BitComet. BitComet has since terminated the partnership, by 2015 FileHippo made BitComet available once more. =Torrent file format= According to the official BitTorrent specification, 'All strings in a .torrent file that contains text must be UTF-8 encoded'. When generating torrents on non-Latin character systems such as Chinese or Japanese, BitComet versions prior to 1.20 encoded the files' names and paths using the Windows Chinese/Japanese code page, and stored a UTF-8 version in a non-standard attribute. Starting with the March 2010 release of version 1.20, BitComet's torrent format now conforms to the standard.

Together, the two cooperatives collectively control an estimated 53% of the New Zealand grocery market. The group owns retail franchises Four Square, New World and Pak'nSave, in-store private labels Pam's, Pam's Finest and Value (formerly named Budget), and a ten percent stake in The Warehouse. Foodstuffs' major competitor is Australian-owned supermarket chain Woolworths NZ, creating an effective duopoly in New Zealand's supermarket industry.  History  The first Foodstuffs co-operative was formed in Auckland in 1922. On 6 July 1922, Foodstuffs founder J Heaton Barker called together members of the Auckland Master Grocers' Association to discuss plans for the formation of a co-operative buying group. The buying group expanded in 1925 with the introduction of Four Square branding on members' stores. Similar co-operatives were set up in other parts of the country, with Wellington commencing also in 1922, Christchurch in 1928 and Dunedin in 1948. Initially the buying groups traded under different names but in 1935, the name Foodstuffs was applied to all the original co-operatives. There have been various mergers between the small regional co-operatives, and until recently there were three co-operative companies: Foodstuffs (Auckland) Ltd; Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-operative Society Ltd, and Foodstuffs South Island Ltd. Each operated independently and autonomously with its own board of directors, chief executive officer and management structure. There were no common members or shareholders. The organisation has continued to evolve, adopting supermarkets early in their evolution with the formation of the New World group in 1963. The Pak'nSave group began later and the first store was opened in Kaitaia in 1985. On 7 February 2013 Foodstuffs (Auckland) Ltd and Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-operative Society Ltd announced that a merger was being planned to bring the two companies together under the name Foodstuffs North Island Ltd. The merged Foodstuffs North Island started trading on 1 September 2013. Four Square Four Square logo Four Square is a trans-Tasman chain of small scale grocery stores ‚Äì ranging from small dairies to small supermarkets. During the 1950s the Foodstuffs advertising department designed the famous \\"Mr 4 Square\\" who initially appeared only in newspaper advertising and posters, but was developed to become part of the Four Square identity, appearing in every Four Square store and eventually becoming a nationally recognised symbol in New Zealand, remaining famous to this day. The image is often closely associated with the art of New Zealand artist Dick Frizzell, who has used the iconic character in many of his works. The current Four Square brand was designed by Auckland branding and design studio Sanders Design. New World New World is a full-service supermarket chain. Founded in 1963, New World was the first American-style full-service supermarket brand of Foodstuffs, and the second in New Zealand (after Foodtown). There is a total of 140 New World supermarkets across the North and South Islands of New Zealand (as of October 2017). New World stores tend to be smaller () and more upscale than their competitors. Prices tend to be higher in most stores, due to the cost of upscale presentation, large employee numbers (200‚Äì300 in some large stores), and often a lack of competition, especially in smaller towns. New World has been a member of the Fly Buys programme since the programme started in September 1996; Foodstuffs has a 25% stake in the Fly Buys company. The New World brand was designed by Auckland design and branding studio Sanders Design. Pak'nSave Pak'nSave is a New Zealand discount supermarket chain owned by the Foodstuffs cooperative. Founded in 1985, Pak'nSave is the most recent of the three current major New Zealand supermarkets (Countdown, New World, and Pak'nSave) to be founded. There are 57 Pak'nSave stores operating across the North and South Islands of New Zealand as of September 2017. Stores are large and have a no-frills environment, often with unlined interiors and concrete floors. Customers are left to pack their own bags or boxes. Pak'nSave was developed following a trip by a group of Foodstuffs executives to the United States in 1985. On that visit they saw Cub Foods, operated by SuperValu, Pak 'n Save operated by Safeway, and other box warehouse supermarkets. Foodstuffs then copied this format in New Zealand. The original Pak'nSave format was almost an identical copy of Safeway's Pak 'n Save chain in Northern California. The PAK'nSAVE brand was designed by Auckland design and branding studio Sanders Design. The stores are supplied daily from their co-operative distributor Foodstuffs. Pak'nSave stores often buys stock in bulk. This process means that stores don't offer a wide variety of products as full- service supermarkets ‚Äì a 2009 Consumer magazine survey noticed this especially in the pet food and toilet paper categories. On September 13 2017, Levin's Write Price supermarket was rebranded as Pak'nSave Mini. Pak'nSave Mini is a small format store that stocks around 2,500 products. In comparison, standard Pak'nSave stores stock approximately 8,000 SKUs. On the Spot On the Spot is a chain of over one hundred convenience stores in the South Island.

It is located in coastal Karnataka, 62.8 kms. north of Mangalore and east of the Arabian Sea. From its location on a plateau, it commands a panoramic view of the Arabian Sea to the west and the Western Ghats to the east. Manipal got its name from Manipal Lake. Home to the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, the town attracts more than twenty five thousand students every year and hence most of the population is students or university staff. It is one of the most cosmopolitan towns of India, reflected in its numerous cafes attracting students and faculty from around 60 countries. There are numerous spots throughout the town that attract students from nearby Mangalore and Udupi such as End Point, DeeTee, Manipal Lake and Malpe Beach. The city owes its rapid development to Manipal Academy of Higher Education for converting this into a student city. It is called \\"Campus Town\\" by the locals. Manipal is also the international headquarters of Syndicate Bank. A regional information technology hub, Manipal has one of the highest densities of mobile phones in India. Location Situated east of the center of the temple city of Udupi and north of Mangalore, Manipal was previously part of the Shivalli village panchayat. Now it is part of Udupi city. The name is derived from \\"munn\\" and \\"palla\\", anglicised to Manipal . Munn means \\"mud\\" and palla means \\"lake\\" in Tulu language. This lake, roughly in the shape of a 400 mtrs. diameter circle, after which Manipal is named, is located in the middle of the town and about 6 kms. away from the Arabian Sea, and has boating facility. The Swarna river passes just north of Manipal. Recreational facilities are available through End Point Park. Manipal was once a barren hill with few trees.

Born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan to Danish immigrant John Malling Sorensen. Malling was the only son of a butcher. He graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with a BA degree in English literature, then continued his studies at Carleton University in Ottawa where he graduated from the School of Journalism. Career Eric Malling was a hard-hitting investigative journalist. Malling initially worked for the provincial government. He then worked as a journalist for the Regina Leader-Post and Swift Current Sun. He followed this by working at The Toronto Star beginning in 1968. From 1976 to 1990, he was the host of the CBC's the fifth estate. In 1978, his one-hour documentary on Gerald Bull and his role in the illegal export of artillery shells from Canada to South Africa during apartheid brought wide acclaim. In another of many sensational stories, the Federal Minister responsible for Fisheries, John Fraser had to resign after Malling revealed he had overruled his own health inspectors and allowed the sale of tainted StarKist brand of tuna based on the suggestion by a non-government corporation. In 1990, he moved to CTV to host W5, which during this period was known as W5 with Eric Malling. In 1995, Malling moved from hosting W5 to hosting Mavericks, a television program that explored controversial political figures and was also produced by CTV. His television journalism earned him a Gemini Award, six ACTRA Awards, three Gordon Sinclair awards for excellence in broadcast journalism. Malling died at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto. He was 52 years of age.

Sixteen episodes were broadcast before it was canceled due to low ratings.  Premise and formats  There were two incarnations of Watching Ellie, neither of which met with any success. Both focused on the character of cabaret singer Ellie Riggs (Louis-Dreyfus), with markedly different approaches. The first was directed by Ken Kwapis, known for his innovative work in single-camera sitcoms such as The Larry Sanders Show, Malcolm in the Middle and The Bernie Mac Show. Each 22-minute episode was meant to portray a 22-minute slice of Ellie's life, in real time. In the earliest episodes, a clock was even shown in the corner of the screen (Louis- Dreyfus stated in 2003 that the clock was Jeff Zucker's idea). Thirteen episodes were filmed but only ten aired before the series was put on indefinite hiatus (the remaining first-season episodes have never aired). Nearly a full year later, the show reappeared as a more traditional sitcom, with multiple cameras and a live studio audience (plus an added laugh track). This version fared even worse than its predecessor and was canceled after six episodes. The show also cast Lauren Bowles as Ellie's sister, Susan. In real life, Bowles is Louis-Dreyfus' half-sister (they have the same mother). Production Louis-Dreyfus and Hall earned salaries of $350,000 each per episode and their contracts stipulated 15 episodes per season, rather than the usual 22. Carsey-Werner-Mandabach Productions, the original production company, dropped out because of the high costs, and was replaced by NBC Studios. The show was pitched to ABC, CBS, Fox and HBO, who all turned down the series.

The choice of W is generally not unique, and the whole idea of \\"coupling\\" is about making such a choice so that X and Y can be related in a particularly desirable way. Definition Using the standard formalism of probability, let X_1 and X_2 be two random variables defined on probability spaces (\\\\Omega_1,F_1,P_1) and (\\\\Omega_2,F_2,P_2). Then a coupling of X_1 and X_2 is a new probability space (\\\\Omega,F,P) over which there are two random variables Y_1 and Y_2 such that Y_1 has the same distribution as X_1 while Y_2 has the same distribution as X_2. An interesting case is when Y_1 and Y_2 are not independent. Examples =Random walk= Assume two particles A and B perform a simple random walk in two dimensions, but they start from different points. The simplest way to couple them is simply to force them to walk together. On every step, if A walks up, so does B, if A moves to the left, so does B, etc. Thus, the difference between the two particles stays fixed. As far as A is concerned, it is doing a perfect random walk, while B is the copycat. B holds the opposite view, i.e. that it is, in effect, the original and that A is the copy. And in a sense they both are right. In other words, any mathematical theorem, or result that holds for a regular random walk, will also hold for both A and B. Consider now a more elaborate example. Assume that A starts from the point (0,0) and B from (10,10). First couple them so that they walk together in the vertical direction, i.e. if A goes up, so does B, etc., but are mirror images in the horizontal direction i.e. if A goes left, B goes right and vice versa. We continue this coupling until A and B have the same horizontal coordinate, or in other words are on the vertical line (5,y). If they never meet, we continue this process forever (the probability for that is zero, though). After this event, we change the coupling rule. We let them walk together in the horizontal direction, but in a mirror image rule in the vertical direction. We continue this rule until they meet in the vertical direction too (if they do), and from that point on, we just let them walk together. This is a coupling in the sense that neither particle, taken on its own, can \\"feel\\" anything we did. Neither the fact that the other particle follows it in one way or the other, nor the fact that we changed the coupling rule or when we did it. Each particle performs a simple random walk. And yet, our coupling rule forces them to meet almost surely and to continue from that point on together permanently. This allows one to prove many interesting results that say that \\"in the long run\\", it is not important where you started in order to obtain that particular result. =Biased coins= Assume two biased coins, the first with probability p of turning up heads and the second with probability q > p of turning up heads. Intuitively, if both coins are tossed the same number of times, the first coin should turn up fewer heads than the second one. More specifically, for any fixed k, the probability that the first coin produces at least k heads should be less than the probability that the second coin produces at least k heads. However proving such a fact can be difficult with a standard counting argument. Coupling easily circumvents this problem. Let X1, X2, ..., Xn be indicator variables for heads in a sequence of flips of the first coin. For the second coin, define a new sequence Y1, Y2, ..., Yn such that * if Xi = 1, then Yi = 1, * if Xi = 0, then Yi = 1 with probability (q ‚àí p)/(1 ‚àí p). Then the sequence of Yi has exactly the probability distribution of tosses made with the second coin. However, because Yi depends on Xi, a toss by toss comparison of the two coins is now possible. That is, for any k ‚â§ n : \\\\Pr(X_1 + \\\\cdots + X_n > k) \\\\leq \\\\Pr(Y_1 + \\\\cdots + Y_n > k). See also * Copula (probability theory) Notes References * T.

Biography Son of Anne Jules de Noailles, he inherited the title duc de Noailles on his father's death in 1708. He fought in the War of the Spanish Succession (1710-1713) during which the forces under his command on 24‚Äì26 July 1710 drove back a British attack on S√®te. He was president of the Finance Council from 1715 to 1718. He distinguished himself in the War of the Polish Succession (1733-1738) and was made a marshal of France in 1734, becoming dean of the marshals in 1748. He served in the War of the Austrian Succession and was appointed to command the French forces in March 1743. He was defeated at the Battle of Dettingen in June 1743, but successfully drove the Austrians out of Alsace-Lorraine the following year, although he missed an opportunity to seriously damage the Austrian army as it was crossing the Rhine. The duc de Noailles was Foreign Minister from April to November 1744, and regarded Great Britain as a greater enemy of France than Austria. He later acted in a diplomatic capacity and had substantial influence over the course of foreign policy. In 1698, as comte d'Ayen, he married Fran√ßoise Charlotte Amable d'Aubign√©, niece and beneficiary of the marquise de Maintenon, and by her had six children, 4 daughters and 2 sons. His two sons Louis, 4th duc de Noailles, and Philippe, duc de Mouchy, also went on to become marshals of France.

The uprising was led by a black Baptist deacon, Samuel Sharpe and waged largely by his followers.  Ideology  The missionary-educated rebels had been following progress of the abolitionist movement in London; their intention was to call a peaceful general strike.Craton, Michael. Testing the Chains: Resistance to Slavery in the British West Indies (Cornell University Press, 1983), pp. 297‚Äì98 Compared with their Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and Moravian counterparts, Baptist slaves seemed more ready to take action. This may have reflected a higher level of absenteeism among white Baptist missionaries. The relative independence of Black deacons facilitated slaves taking greater ownership over their religious life, including reinterpretations of Baptist theology in terms of their experience (for example, they placed an emphasis on the role of John the Baptist, sometimes at the expense of Jesus.Turner, Mary. Slaves and Missionaries: The Disintegration of Jamaican Slave Society, 1787‚Äì1834 (University of Illinois Press, 1982), p. 81) Thomas Burchell, a missionary in Montego Bay, returned from England following Christmas vacation. Many of the Baptist ministry expected that he would return with papers for emancipation from the king, William IV. They also thought that the King's men would enforce the order and discontent escalated among slaves when the Jamaican governor announced that no emancipation had been granted.  The strike and the uprising  Led by 'native' Baptist preacher, Samuel Sharpe, enslaved black workers demanded more freedom and a working wage of \\"half the going wage rate\\"; they took an oath to stay away from work until their demands were met by the plantation owners. The enslaved laborers believed that the work stoppage could achieve their ends alone ‚Äì a resort to force was only envisaged if violence was used against them.The overthrow of colonial slavery, 1776‚Äì1848 Book by Robin Blackburn p. 432 Sharpe was the inspiration for the rebellion, and was nicknamed \\"Daddy\\" Sharpe. His military commanders were mainly literate slaves, like him, and they included Johnson, a carpenter called Campbell from York estate, a waggoner from Greenwich estate named Robert Gardner, Thomas Dove from Belvedere estate, John Tharp from Hazlelymph estate, and George Taylor, who, like Sharpe, was a deacon in Burchell's chapel.Craton, Testing the Chains, p. 299.

The rebellion exploded on December 27, when slaves set fire to Kensington estate, in the hills above Montego Bay. Colonel William Grignon of the militia was an attorney who ran several estates, including one at Salt Spring, where a series of incidents in December were the sparks for the uprising.Craton, Testing the Chains, p. 293. Grignon led the militia against the rebels at Belvedere estate, but he was forced to retreat, leaving the rebels in command of the rural areas of the parish of St James.Bleby, Henry, Death Struggles of Slavery: Being a Narrative of Facts and Incidents Which Occurred in a British Colony, During the Two Years Immediately Preceding Negro Emancipation (London: Hamilton, Adams and Co, 1853), pp. 9‚Äì11.

Sir Willoughby Cotton, who commanded the British forces, then summoned the Jamaican Maroons of Accompong Town to help suppress the rebellion in the second week of January. However, when the Accompong Maroons attacked the rebels at Catadupa, they were forced to withdraw because the rebels were \\"too strong\\".Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739‚Äì1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), p. 201. The Accompong Maroons soon gained the upper hand however, and they defeated the rebels in one skirmish, killing one of Sharpe's deputies, Campbell, in the assault. When the army regulars were besieged by the rebels at Maroon Town, the Accompong Maroons relieved them, killing more rebels, and capturing scores of them, including another of Sharpe's deputies, Dehany.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 202‚Äì03. When the Windward Maroons from Charles Town, Jamaica and Moore Town answered the call of Cotton, the rebel cause was lost.

Suppression and death toll  The rebellion was quickly suppressed by British forces. The reaction of the Jamaican government and reprisals of the plantocracy were far more brutal. Approximately 500 slaves were killed, with 207 killed outright during the revolt. After the rebellion, an estimated 310 to 340 slaves were killed through \\"various forms of judicial executions\\". At times, slaves were executed for quite minor offenses (one recorded execution was for the theft of a pig; another, a cow).Mary Reckord. \\"The Jamaican Slave Rebellion of 1831\\", Past & Present (July 1968), 40(3): pp. 122, 124‚Äì25. An 1853 account by Henry Bleby described how the courts commonly executed three or four persons simultaneously; bodies were piled up until the black people relegated to the workhouse carted the bodies away at night and buried them in mass graves outside town.

The planters suspected many missionaries of having encouraged the rebellion. Some, such as William Knibb and Bleby, were arrested, tarred and feathered, but later released. Groups of white colonials destroyed chapels that housed black congregations.Masters, P., 2006: Missionary triumph over slavery. Wakeman Trust, London. . pp. 17‚Äì23 Aftermath As a result of the Baptist War, hundreds of slaves ran away into the Cockpit Country in order to avoid being forced back into slavery. The Maroons were only successful in apprehending a small number of these runaway slaves. Many runaways remained free and at large when the British parliament passed the Act abolishing slavery in 1833.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 205‚Äì08. Historians argue that the brutality of the Jamaican plantocracy during the revolt accelerated the British political process of emancipating the slaves. When Burchell and Knibb described how badly they were treated by the colonial militias, the House of Commons expressed their outrage that white planters could have tarred and feathered white missionaries. Parliament passed the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 for initial measures to begin in 1834, followed by partial emancipation (outright for children six or under, six years apprenticeship for the rest) in 1834 and then unconditional emancipation of chattel slavery in 1838.Craton, Testing the Chains, pp. 316‚Äì19.

Built in 1896, it is located near the Cliff House, Seal Rocks, and Sutro Heights Park. The facility burned down in June 1966 and is now in ruins within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Sutro Historic District.  History  On March 14, 1896, the Sutro Baths were opened to the public as the world's largest indoor swimming pool establishment. The baths were built on the western side of San Francisco by wealthy entrepreneur and former mayor of San Francisco (1894‚Äì1896) Adolph Sutro. The structure was situated in a small beach inlet below the Cliff House, also owned by Adolph Sutro at the time. Both the Cliff House and the former baths site are now a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, operated by the United States National Park Service. The baths struggled for years, mostly due to the very high operating and maintenance costs. Eventually, the baths were converted into an ice skating rink until 1964 when the property was sold to developers for a planned high-rise apartment complex. A fire in 1966 destroyed the building while it was in the process of being demolished. All that remains of the site are concrete walls, blocked-off stairs and passageways, and a tunnel with a deep crevice in the middle. The cause of the fire was determined to be arson. Shortly afterwards, the developers left San Francisco and claimed insurance money. Infrastructure and facilities The following statistics are from a 1912 article written by J. E. Van Hoosear of Pacific Gas and Electric. Materials used in the structure included of glass, 600 tons of iron, of lumber, and of concrete. During high tides, water would flow directly into the pools from the nearby ocean, recycling the two million US gallons (7,600 m¬≥) of water in about an hour. During low tides, a powerful turbine water pump, built inside a cave at sea level, could be switched on from a control room and could fill the tanks at a rate of 6,000 US gallons a minute (380 L/s), recycling all the water in five hours. Facilities included: * Six saltwater pools and one freshwater pool. The baths were long and wide for a capacity of . They were equipped with 7 slides, 30 swinging rings, and 1 springboard. * A museum displaying an extensive collection of stuffed and mounted animals, historic artifacts, and artwork, much of which Sutro acquired from the Woodward's Gardens estate sale in 1894. * A 2700-seat amphitheater, and club rooms with capacity for 1100. * 517 private dressing rooms. * An ice skating rink. The baths were once served by two rail lines. The Ferries and Cliff House Railroad ran along the cliffs of Lands End overlooking the Golden Gate. The route ran from the baths to a terminal at California Street and Central Avenue, now Presidio Avenue.\\"The Ferries & Cliff House Railway\\" Cable Car Museum San Francisco The second line was the Sutro Railroad, which ran electric trolleys to Golden Gate Park and downtown San Francisco.

Toponymy In 1912, William Crossing, writer and documenter, said that the name High Willes had been thought to have derived from the word huel or wheal meaning mine, but he did not think that very likely as old mine workings were invariably located near to streams. He suggested instead that the name derived from gwylfa, a watching place, noting its similarity with Brown Willy, the name of the highest hill on nearby Bodmin Moor, and suggested that a watch for beacon fires used to be kept here. He also posited a possible link to the word gwili meaning winding or tortuous, but said it was unlikely this was where it originated from. The Place-Names of Devon (1931) notes that the peak was named Hight Wyll in a document of 1532, and was known in 1827 as High Willows. The authors state that the name may simply be a compound of high and well (meaning spring), though they admit that the additional syllable at the end is hard to explain. Topography High Willhays is near the northwestern edge of Dartmoor, about south east of Meldon Reservoir and about south of the town of Okehampton. Although it is the highest point of the moor, it is relatively insignificant in comparison to most of the moor's tors, consisting of no more than a few low outcrops of rock along a north‚Äìsouth ridge. The largest outcrop is crowned with a cairn. The more impressive, but slightly lower, Yes Tor is about north along this ridge, which is known as \\"the roof of Devon\\". High Willhays and Yes Tor are the only summits in England south of Kinder Scout in the Peak District to rise above , apart from Black Mountain on the Welsh border. Before Ordnance Survey measured accurately the heights of High Willhays and Yes Tor many people believed Yes Tor was the higher of the two, and it was only the local farmers and moormen that believed the contrary. However, the first topographical survey of the area carried out by Ordnance Survey suggested that High Willhays was higher, although the difference has now been measured at just . William Crossing stated that High Willhays was the highest point in England south of Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales, but since then surveys have shown that Kinder Scout is also higher (albeit less prominent). The geology of High Willhays, like most of Dartmoor, consists of granite intruded about 280 million years ago. However High Willhays is in an area of the northern plateau of the moor where the exposed rock has noticeably fewer of the large feldspar megacrysts that are typical of most of Dartmoor's tors. Each of the outcrops displays lamellar bedding. High Willhays is within one of Dartmoor's Danger Zones, areas used periodically by the British Army for exercises. Red flags are raised around the perimeter when live-firing is due to take place.

The city of Arnhem lies on the right (north) bank of the Nederrijn, just past the point where the IJssel branches off. The Nederrijn flows on to the city of Wijk bij Duurstede, from where it continues as the Lek. The once-important but now small Kromme Rijn branch (in Roman times part of the Limes Germanicus and border river of the Roman Empire) carries the name \\"Rhine\\" towards the city of Utrecht. In order to regulate the distribution of drainage between the different branches of the Rhine, several dams have been constructed. If the dams are closed, there is little flow in the Nederrijn and most of the water is drained by the IJssel. Bridges over the Nederrijn are in Arnhem (railway and three road bridges), in Heteren (A50) and Rhenen. Ferries are found near Doorwerth, Wageningen, Opheusden, Elst and Amerongen. History In 1530, the Rhine near Arnhem was moved, a project that was completed in 1536. The city, which originated along the St. Jansbeek (\\"St. John's Brook'), could develop better now that it was closer to the river, and was also more easily defended against Habsburg expansionism into Guelders.

A number of early European colonies in the New World were largely plantocracies, usually consisting of a small European settler population relying on a predominantly West African chattel slave population (as well as smaller numbers of indentured servants, both European and non-European in origin), and later, freed Black and poor white sharecroppers for labor. These plantocracies proved to be a decisive force in the anti-abolitionist movement.

The story is set on Earth near the end of the 21st century, probably between 2082 and 2089, in a world where technology has advanced somewhat beyond the present. The most notable advancement is the widespread availability of full-immersion virtual reality installations, which allow people from all walks of life to access an online world, called simply the Net. Tad Williams weaves an intricate plot spanning four thick volumes, and creates a picture of a future society where virtual worlds are fully integrated into everyday life. His proposed ability to immerse oneself fully in a simulation gives him a great deal of artistic freedom, and the story winds through alternate interpretations of many classical literary works such as Through the Looking-Glass, The Odyssey and The Iliad, The War of the Worlds, and The Wizard of Oz, which are available as entertainment simulations within the series. Orlando Gardiner, one of the main characters in the books, spent most of his teenage years in this world's equivalent to MMORPGs based upon J. R. R. Tolkien's fiction. The overall series's events also bear a strong resemblance to The Lord of the Rings. Books *Book 1‚ÄîCity of Golden Shadow (Hardcover 1996, Paperback 1998) *Book 2‚ÄîRiver of Blue Fire (Hardcover 1998, Paperback 1999) *Book 3‚ÄîMountain of Black Glass (Hardcover 1999, Paperback 2000) *Book 4‚ÄîSea of Silver Light (Hardcover 2001, Paperback 2002) The story opens with Paul Jonas, a British infantryman in an apparent part of the Western Front of World War I. Wounded, he has a vivid dream in which he meets a \\"bird-woman\\", and after he wakes up, he discovers one of her feathers with him in the trenches. Realizing that the world is not as it seems, he flees, pursued by his comrades Finch and Mullet, who suddenly have different appearances. Suffering from almost complete memory loss, he begins to travel through a series of bizarre worlds, seeking answers to who he is and his connection to the bird-woman. She appears to him in several guises as he travels, and is initially one of the few things he remembers from before the trenches. Meanwhile, in the late 21st century, technology has advanced so that the internet has become a vast Virtual Reality network. The most realistic connections to the network are achieved by using an expensive, surgically implanted bio-port interface at the back of the user's neck called a 'neurocannula'. However, around the world, children are falling victim to a disease known as Tandagore Syndrome, which in its most serious form is a deep coma from which the patient cannot wake. Irene \\"Renie\\" Sulaweyo, an instructor in \\"virtual engineering\\" at a polytechnic institute in Durban, South Africa, is devastated when her younger brother, Stephen, falls victim to this disease. She and her former San technology student !Xabbu (pronounced with an unspecified clicking sound, as in the Xhosa language) begin to investigate what has happened and start discovering strange goings-on in the Net, including an evil hypnotic entity and the constant reappearance of a mysterious golden city. She seeks expert assistance from a previous instructor, Susan van Bleeck. But it soon becomes apparent that she has made powerful enemies: Renie is dismissed from her job, the apartment complex where she and her unemployed father Long Joseph live is burned down, and Professor van Bleeck is murdered. Renie turns to two of van Bleeck's acquaintances: a retired security expert and hacker called \\"Blue Dog Anchorite\\" and the French researcher Martine Desroubins. Blue Dog Anchorite informs the others that Otherland, the mysterious network where the golden city is located, was specially commissioned by a cryptic organization known as the \\"Grail Brotherhood\\", comprising some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful men and women, and that he is the only surviving member of the team who devised Otherland's security, his colleagues having died in unusual circumstances. With the help of Martine and Blue Dog, Renie, !Xabbu, Long Joseph and van Bleeck's assistant Jeremiah Dako break into Wasps' Nest, a mothballed military base in the Drakensberg which nevertheless contains equipment facilitating extended stays online. While Long Joseph and Jeremiah stay offline, she, !Xabbu and Martine (who remains in France) break into the Otherland network to reach the golden city. In North America, Orlando Gardiner and his friend Sam Fredericks, famous contestants in the Middle Country, a Medieval fantasy gameworld, go on an apparently routine quest, where Orlando finds his own image of the golden city. While he is distracted by the image, his gaming character is killed, and he becomes obsessed with finding out what the city is and why it was shown to him. Following the trail of the city, he and Fredericks gain access to the online fringe community TreeHouse, from where they too find their way into Otherland. Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, Orlando and Fredericks, along with several others, find themselves in an uncomfortable situation. In the simulation world, they are held prisoner by the king of Temil√∫n (the golden city), who is none other than Bolivar Atasco, a former member of the Grail Brotherhood. Furthermore, they are unable to drop offline, and experience terrible pain if disconnected by others. Summoned to an audience with Atasco and his wife, they meet a mysterious man named Sellars, who claims to have gathered them. Sellars gives them a mission: they are to find Paul Jonas, who is at large somewhere within Otherland's many simulation worlds. But before the briefing can finish, the Atascos' home in the real world is assaulted by assassins working for the Grail Brotherhood. Bolivar and his wife are murdered, and Sellars vanishes. Even as the group flees Temil√∫n, one of their \\"sims\\"‚Äîsimulation bodies‚Äîis secretly taken over by John Dread, a murderous young man who directed the Grail Brotherhood's assault on the Atascos and who now seeks to learn about Otherland to his own advantage. As they try to discover the motivations of the Grail Brotherhood‚Äîobviously not world domination, since they already control the world‚Äîthey discover that they are unable to log off. They are trapped, and if they die in the network, they also die in real life. The series covers their adventures as they seek to uncover the truth and wake their loved ones from their comas. =Short stories= *\\"The Happiest Dead Boy in the World\\" (published in Legends II, edited by Robert Silverberg, from Del Rey/Ballantine/Random House, Hardcover 2003) *\\"The Boy Detective of Oz: An Otherland Story\\" Major characters =The Volunteers= *Mr. Sellars‚Äîa mysterious man kept under house arrest on a US Military base.

Life and work A member of the Czech avant-garde association of artists Devƒõtsil, an award-winning novelist, a literary translator, a journalist and a curator, Ji≈ô√≠ Weil is only gradually gaining renown after years of relative obscurity.Sayer, Derek. The Coasts of Bohemia. Princeton University Press, 1998. He was the one of the first writers to address the Soviet Purges in a novel, the very first writer to set a novel in a Gulag, and among the first writers to address the fate of Czech Jews in World War II. Biography Ji≈ô√≠ Weil was born in Praskolesy, a village about 40 kilometers outside Prague on 6 August 1900. He was the second son born to upper-middle- class Orthodox Jewish parents. Weil graduated from secondary school in 1919. As a student he had already begun writing mainly verses, but had also begun planning his three-part novel, Mƒõsto, which he planned to publish under the pseudonym, Ji≈ô√≠ Wilde. Upon graduation, Weil was accepted to Charles University in Prague where he entered the Department of Philosophy and also studied Slavic philology and comparative literature. He was a favourite student of F.X. ≈†alda. He completed his doctoral dissertation, \\"Gogol and the English Novel of the 18th Century\\", in 1928. In 1921, Weil joined the Young Communists and attained a position of leadership in the group. He had a keen interest in Russian literature and Soviet culture. About that same time, his first articles were published about cultural life in the Soviet Union in the Newspaper \\"Rud√© Pr√°vo.\\" He also became one of the first translators of contemporary Russian literature into the Czech language and bringing works by Boris Pasternak, Vladimir Lugovskoy and Marina Tsvetaeva to Czech readers. He was the first person to translate the works of Vladimir Mayakovsky into Czech. In 1922, Weil traveled for the first time to the Soviet Union with a youth delegation. He writes about an ill-fated meeting with the poet Sergei Esenin in his feuilleton, \\"Busta b√°sn√≠kova.\\" Weil worked in Moscow from 1933 to 1935 as a journalist and translator of Marxist literature in the publishing department of the Comintern, the international wing of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In this capacity, he helped translate Vladimir Lenin's \\"The State and Revolution\\" into Czech. After the 1934 assassination of Sergei Kirov, which marked the beginning of the Stalinist Purges, Weil found himself on shaky ground in Moscow and in the Communist party. He was expelled from the Communist Party and exiled to Central Asia. The circumstances of his expulsion and his subsequent deportation to Central Asia have never been fully explained, but these experiences marked a turning point for Weil. They are described in a samizdat biography by Weil's friend, Jaroslava Vondr√°ƒçkov√°, Mrazilo ‚Äì t√°lo. In 1935, Weil returned to Prague and published his novel Moskva-hranice (1937), an account of the purges. The Munich Agreement heralded trouble for Europe's Jewish population, but Weil was unable to join relatives in Great Britain. During the Nazi occupation, Weil was assigned to work at the Jewish Museum in Prague. He was called to be interned at the Terez√≠n (Theresienstadt) ghetto in November 1942, but he decided not to go, instead staging his own death. Weil survived the rest of the war by hiding in various illegal apartments, with several acquaintances and even spent time hiding in a hospital. Despite the tremendous hardship, Weil continued to write. After the war, Weil reintegrated into cultural life and from 1946 to 1948, he worked as an editor at ELK. He published a lyrical book of tributes to fallen comrades, B√°rvy (Colours), a novel, Makanna otec div≈Ø, which won the Czechoslovak book prize that year, and a small book of reminiscences about Julius Fuƒç√≠k. After 1948, Weil lost his position and the press was nationalized. From 1949 on, Weil's work focuses on Jewish themes. His book Life with a Star, published without fanfare in 1949, is probably his best-known work. It received varying critical attention, but a firestorm of controversy over it erupted in 1951. Critics decried it as \\"decadent\\", \\"existentialist\\", \\"highly subjective\\" and \\"the product of a cowardly culture.\\" It was roundly criticized from both an ideological and a religious standpoint and was banned. He resumed work at the Jewish Museum, where he was instrumental in the creation of an exhibition of children's drawings from Terez√≠n, I Never Saw Another Butterfly, and the creation of a monument for Jewish citizens murdered by Nazis in the Pinkas Synagogue, for which he wrote a prose poem, ≈Ωalozpƒõv za 77 297 obƒõt√≠. In the thaw following the death of Klement Gottwald, Weil was readmitted to the Writers' Union. Weil worked continuously until his death from leukemia in 1959. Weil's legacy In recent years, Weil's \\"Star\\" is considered a classic. According to Philip Roth (who was largely responsible for introducing Weil to American readers) the book is \\"without a doubt, one of the outstanding novels I've read about the fate of a Jew under the Nazis. I don't know another like it.\\" Michiko Kakutani adds that it is \\"one of the most powerful works to emerge from the Holocaust: it is a fierce and necessary work of art.\\" And Siri Hustvedt has written ; \\"When I mention this astounding novel to people, I am almost always met with blankness. It may be that its subject matter, the Nazi occupation of Prague, is grim. I don't know. What I do know is that I read the book when it came out ‚Äì (the English translation, published in 1989, 40 years after its first publication in Czechoslovakia) ‚Äì and it burned itself into me. The words German, Nazi and Jew never appear. There is nothing coy about these omissions. They are essential to the novel's uncanny immediacy, its urgent telling of a human story which, despite its particularity, refuses to locate itself in the past.\\"The Observer, Review Section, p.6, 2 September 2007 Beyond \\"Life with a Star\\" and \\"Mendelssohn is on the Roof\\" Weil's fiction is woefully underrepresented in English-language translations.

He also performed alongside The Beatles in their debut film A Hard Day's Night, playing the fictional grandfather of Paul McCartney. Early life Brambell was born in Dublin, the youngest of three sons born to Henry Lytton Brambell (1870‚Äì1937), a cashier at the Guinness Brewery, and his wife, Edith Marks (1879‚Äì1965), a former opera singer. The family surname was changed from \\"Bramble\\" by Wilfrid's grandfather Frederick William Brambell. His two older brothers were Frederick Edward Brambell (1905‚Äì1980) and James Christopher Marks \\"Jim\\" Brambell (1907‚Äì1992). His first appearance was as a child, entertaining the wounded troops during the First World War. After leaving school, he worked part-time as a reporter for The Irish Times and part-time as an actor at the Abbey Theatre before becoming a professional actor for the Gate Theatre. He also did repertory at Swansea, Bristol and Chesterfield.The Times Obituary, 19 January 1985 In the Second World War, he joined the British military forces entertainment organisation ENSA. Acting career Brambell had roles in film and television films from 1947, first appearing (uncredited) in Odd Man Out as a tram passenger. His television career began during the 1950s, when he was cast in small roles in three Nigel Kneale/Rudolph Cartier productions for BBC Television: as a drunk in The Quatermass Experiment (1953), as both an old man in a pub and later a prisoner in Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954), and as a tramp in Quatermass II (1955). All of these roles earned him a reputation for playing old men, though he was only in his forties at the time. He appeared as Bill Gaye in the 1962 Maurice Chevalier/Hayley Mills picture, In Search of the Castaways. He was heard in the original soundtrack of The Canterbury Tales, which was one of the quickest selling West End soundtrack albums of all time. He also released two 45-rpm singles, \\"Second Hand\\"/\\"Rag Time Ragabone Man\\", that played on his Steptoe and Son character, followed in 1971 by \\"Time Marches On\\", his tribute to the Beatles, with whom he had worked in 1964 (and had met many times). It featured a Beatles-esque guitar riff, with Brambell reciting words about the Beatles' splitting up. The B-side was \\"The Decimal Song\\" which, at the time of Britain's adopting decimal currency, was politically charged. Brambell was featured in many prominent theatre roles. In 1966, he played Ebenezer Scrooge in a musical version of A Christmas Carol. This was adapted for radio the same year, and appeared on Radio 2 on Christmas Eve. Brambell's booming baritone voice surprised many listeners: he played the role straight, true to the Dickens original, and not in the stereotype Albert Steptoe character. In 1971, he starred in the premiere of Eric Chappell's play, The Banana Box, in which he played Rooksby. This part was later renamed Rigsby for the television adaptation called Rising Damp, with Leonard Rossiter replacing Brambell in the role. Brambell also played the part of an Irish widower in the film Holiday on the Buses; the character in question started a close friendship with Stan Butler's mother Mabel. Steptoe and Son, A Hard Day's Night It was this ability to play old men that led to his casting in his best remembered role as Albert Steptoe, the irascible father in Steptoe and Son, a man who ‚Äì when the series began ‚Äì was said to be in his sixties, even though Brambell was only aged 50 in 1962 (thirteen years older than Harry H. Corbett, who played his son Harold). The series began as a pilot on the BBC's Comedy Playhouse, and its success led to the commissioning of a full series. It ran from 1962 to 1974, including a five-year hiatus. A constant thread throughout the series was Albert being referred to by Harold as a \\"dirty old man\\"; for example, when he was eating pickled onions while taking a bath, and retrieving dropped onions from the bathwater. There were also two feature film spin-offs, a stage show and an American incarnation titled Sanford and Son, some episodes of which were almost exact remakes of the original British scripts. The success of Steptoe and Son made Brambell a high-profile figure on British television, and earned him the supporting role of Paul McCartney's grandfather in the Beatles' first film, A Hard Day's Night (1964). A running joke is made throughout the film of his character being \\"a very clean old man\\", in contrast to his being referred to as a \\"dirty old man\\" in Steptoe and Son. In real life, he was indeed nothing like his Steptoe persona, being dapper and well- spoken. In 1965, Brambell told the BBC that he did not want to do another series of Steptoe and Son, and in September that year, he went to New York City to appear in the Broadway musical Kelly at the Broadhurst Theatre. However, it closed after a single performance. Apart from his role as the older Steptoe, Brambell achieved recognition in many films. His performance in 'The Terence Davies Trilogy' won him critical acclaim, far greater than any achieved for Steptoe and Son.Terence Davies interview on the Extras of the DVD release. Davies claims that Brambell's performance won festival awards and achieved high critical acclaim Although he appears throughout the full 24-minute piece, Brambell does not speak a single word. Personal and later life After the final series of Steptoe and Son was made, in 1974, Brambell had some guest roles in films and on television. He and Harry H. Corbett also undertook a tour of Australia in 1977 in a stage production based on Steptoe and Son. In 1982, Brambell appeared on the BBC's television news paying tribute to Corbett, after the latter's death from a heart attack. In 1982 , Brambell appeared in Terence Davies's film Death and Transfiguration, playing a dying elderly man who finally comes to terms with his homosexuality. In 2002, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary film, When Steptoe Met Son, about the off-screen life of Brambell and his relationship with Corbett. The film claimed that the two men detested each other and were barely on speaking terms after the Australian tour. The rift was apparently caused in part by Brambell's alcoholism, and led to the two men leaving the country on separate aircraft. This claim is disputed by the writers of Steptoe and Son, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, who were unaware of any hatred or conflict.\\"Scriptwriters Reject the 'Curse of Comedy', The Times, Published online 8 March 2008; retrieved 7 February 2011. Corbett's nephew released a statement in which he claimed that the actors did not hate each other: \\"We can categorically say they did not fall out. They were together for nearly a year in Australia, went on several sightseeing trips together, and left the tour at the end on different 'planes because Harry was going on holiday with his family, not because he refused to get on the same 'plane. They continued to work together after the Australian tour on radio and adverts.\\" Brambell was homosexual at a time when it was impossible for public figures to be openly gay, not least because male homosexual acts were illegal in England and Wales until 1967. In 1962, he was arrested in a toilet in Shepherd's Bush for persistently importuning and given a conditional discharge. He was married, from 1948 to 1955, to Mary \\"Molly\\" Josephine Hall,http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- marriages-1837-2008?spouse1forename=henry&spouse1surname;=brambell but the relationship ended in divorce after she gave birth to the child of their lodger in 1955. Death Brambell died as a result of cancer at his home in Westminster, London, aged 72 on 18 January, 1985. He was cremated on 25 January, 1985 at Streatham Park Cemetery, where his ashes were scattered. Legacy The Curse of Steptoe, a BBC television play about Brambell and his co-star Harry H. Corbett, was broadcast on 19 March 2008 on digital BBC channel BBC Four, featuring Phil Davis as Brambell. The first broadcast gained the channel its highest audience figures to date, based on overnight returns.

He has received the Magnesia Litera award and the Franz Kafka Prize, among other honors.Interview: Ivan Kl√≠ma, Stephan Delbos, The Prague Post, 29 February 2012  Biography  Kl√≠ma's early childhood in Prague was happy and uneventful, but this all changed with the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, after the Munich Agreement. He had been unaware that both his parents had Jewish ancestry; neither were observant Jews, but this was immaterial to the Germans. In November 1941, first his father Vil√©m Kl√≠ma, and then in December, he and his mother and brother were ordered to leave for the concentration camp at Theriesenstadt (Terez√≠n), where he was to remain until liberation by the Red Army in May, 1945. Both he and his parents survived incarceration, a miracle at that time, as Terez√≠n was a holding camp for Jews from central and southern Europe, and was regularly cleared of its overcrowded population by transports to \\"the East\\", death camps such as Auschwitz. The family adopted the less German-sounding surname of Kl√≠ma after the war. Kl√≠ma has written graphically of this period in articles in the UK literary magazine, Granta, particularly A Childhood in Terezin.Ivan Kl√≠ma. A Childhood in Terezin. Granta 44, 1993, pp 191‚Äì208 It was while living in these extreme conditions that he says he first experienced \\"the liberating power that writing can give\\", after reading a school essay to his class. He was also in the midst of a story-telling community, pressed together under remarkable circumstances where death was ever-present. Children were quartered with their mothers, where he was exposed to a rich verbal culture of song and anecdote. This remarkable and unusual background was not the end of the Kl√≠ma's introduction to the great historical forces that shaped mid-century Europe. With liberation came the rise of the Czech Communist regime, and the replacement of Nazi tyranny with proxy Soviet control of the inter-war Czech democratic experiment. Klima became a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. Later, his childhood hopes of fairy tale triumphs of good over evil became an adult awareness that it was often \\"not the forces of good and evil that do battle with each other, but merely two different evils, in competition for the control of the world\\". The early show trials and murders of those who opposed the new regime had already begun, and Kl√≠ma's father was again imprisoned, this time by his own countrymen. It is this dark background that is the crucible out of which Kl√≠ma's written material was shaped: the knowledge of the depths of human cruelty, along with a private need for personal integrity, the struggle of the individual to keep whatever personal values the totalitarian regimes he lived under were attempting to obliterate. For his writing abilities, Ivan Kl√≠ma was awarded Franz Kafka Prize in 2002 as a second recipient. His two-volume memoir Moje ≈°√≠len√© stolet√≠ (\\"My Crazy Century\\") won the Czech literary prize, the Magnesia Litera, in the non- fiction category in 2010.

It is associated with ancient Greek cosmology, such as is presented not just in the works of Homer and Hesiod, but also in virtually every internal system: there is no break in-between a world that did not exist and one that did, since it could not be created in the first place. Parmenides The idea that \\"nothing comes from nothing\\", as articulated by Parmenides, first appears in Aristotle's Physics: The above, in a translation based on the John Burnet translation, appears as follows: Lucretius The Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius expressed this principle in his first book of (On the Nature of Things) He then continues on discussing how matter is required to make matter and that objects cannot spring forth without reasonable cause. Modern physics The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system cannot change. The zero-energy universe states that the amount of energy in the universe minus the amount of gravity is exactly zero. That is the only kind of universe that could come from nothing, assuming such a zero-energy universe already is nothing. by Alexei V. Filippenko and Jay M. Pasachoff Such a universe would need to be flat, a state which does not contradict current observations that the universe is flat with a 0.5% margin of error. Some physicists‚Äîsuch as Lawrence Krauss, Stephen Hawking, and Michio Kaku‚Äîdefine or defined 'nothing' as an unstable quantum vacuum that contains no particles. This is different from the philosophical conception of nothing, which has no inherent properties and is not governed by physical laws. Quantum mechanics proposes that pairs of virtual particles are being created from quantum fluctuations in this \\"empty\\" space all the time. If these pairs do not mutually annihilate right away, they could be detected as real particles, for example if one falls into a black hole and its opposite is emitted as Hawking radiation. Alexander Vilenkin defines \\"nothing\\" as a universe of zero size: It is closer to nothing as one can get, but still not nothing.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.  Family  Memorial at Doderer's birthplace Heimito von Doderer was born in Weidlingau, since 1938 a part of Vienna, in a forester's lodge where his family stayed while his father, the architect and engineer (1854, Klosterbruck (), Znaim 1932, Vienna) worked on the regulation of the Wien River. The lodge was not preserved, today a memorial marks the site. Wilhelm Carl Doderer also worked on the construction of the Tauern Railway, the Kiel Canal and the Wiener Stadtbahn public transport network. His brother Richard (18761955) and his father (1825, Heilbronn 1900, Vienna; ennobled in 1877) too were noted architects and industrialists. Carl Wilhelm's wife Maria von (18351914) by her mother was related to the Austrian poet Nikolaus Lenau. Doderer's mother, Wilhelm Carl's wife Louise Wilhelmine \\"Willy\\" von H√ºgel (18621946) also was the daughter of the established German building contractor (18281899), who had worked with her later husband on several railroad projects. Her sister Charlotte had married (1859, Vienna 1936, Vienna), son of Heinrich von Ferstel, architect of the Vienna Votive Church. Max von Ferstel had designed the plans for the Doderer family home in the Vienna Landstra√üe district. Until World War I, the Doderer family ranked among the wealthiest industrial dynasties of the Austro- Hungarian monarchy. Heimito was the youngest of six children. His unusual first name was a German phonetic spelling of the Spanish name Jaimito, a diminutive of Jaime (James). As Louise Wilhelmine was Protestant, her children likewise were baptised evangelical, although they grew up in a mainly Catholic environment.  Life and work  Heimito von Doderer spent most of his life in Vienna, where he attended the gymnasium school with moderate success. He spent his summers in his family's retreat in Reichenau an der Rax. The adolescent entered into a homoerotic romantic affair with his home tutor, and gained bisexual and sadomasochistic experiences as a frequent brothel visitor. In 1914 he narrowly passed his matura exams and enrolled to study law at the University of Vienna, however, in April 1915 he joined the dragoon regiment No. 3 of the Austro-Hungarian Army and served in the mounted infantry at the Eastern Front in Galicia and Bukovina. On 12 July 1916 (during Brusilov Offensive) he was captured as a prisoner of war by the Imperial Russian Army in the area of Tlumach. A long way from home, in a Russian Far East camp for officer POWs in Krasnaya Rechka near Khabarovsk, he decided to become an author and began writing. Upon the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk he was released by the Bolshevik government, but had to make his way back to Austria through the Russian Civil War. Stranded in Samara, Doderer and his comrades again turned to the East, and found refuge in a Red Cross camp near Krasnoyarsk, cared for by Elsa Br√§ndstr√∂m. Many men had died from typhoid fever during their flight. Doderer stayed in Siberia until his eventual return to Austria in 1920; he finally reached Vienna on 14 August. His first published work, the book of poems Gassen und Landschaft (\\"Streets and countryside\\"), appeared in 1923, followed by the novel Die Bresche (\\"The breach\\") in 1924, both with little success. A second novel, Das Geheimnis des Reichs (\\"The secret of the empire\\"), was published in 1930. In the same year he married Gusti Hasterlik, but they separated two years later and were divorced in 1938. In 1933 Doderer joined the Austrian section of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and published several stories in the Deutsch√∂sterreichische Tages-Zeitung (\\"German-Austrian Daily\\"), a newspaper closely linked to the party and promoting racism and the incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany. In 1936 he moved to Dachau, Germany, where he met Emma Maria Thoma, who would become his second wife in 1952. In Germany, he renewed his NSDAP membership (the Austrian Nazi Party had been banned since 1933). He returned to Vienna in 1938, sharing a flat with the celebrated painter Albert Paris G√ºtersloh. In that year the novel Ein Mord, den jeder begeht (\\"A murder everyone commits\\") was published. He converted to Catholicism in 1940 as a result of his reading of Thomas Aquinas and his alienation from the Nazis, which had been growing for some years. Also in 1940, Doderer was called up to the Wehrmacht and was later posted to German-occupied France, where he began work on his most celebrated novel Die Strudlhofstiege (the name refers to the so-called Strudlhofstiege, an outdoor staircase in Vienna). Due to ill health, he was allowed in 1943 to return from France, serving in the Vienna area, before a final posting to Oslo at the end of the war. After his return to Austria in early 1946, he was banned from publishing until 1947. He continued work on Die Strudlhofstiege, but although he completed it in 1948, the still-obscure author was unable to get it published immediately. However, when it did finally appear in 1951 it was a huge success, and Doderer's place in the post-war Austrian literary scene was assured. Doderer subsequently returned to an earlier unfinished project, Die D√§monen (\\"The demons\\"), which appeared in 1956 to much acclaim. In 1958 he began work on what was intended to be a four-volume novel under the general title of Roman Nr. 7 (\\"Novel No. 7\\"), to be written as a counterpart to Beethoven's Seventh Symphony. The first volume Die Wasserf√§lle von Slunj, appeared in 1963; the second volume, Der Grenzwald, was to be his last work and was published, incomplete and posthumously, in 1967. Doderer died of intestinal cancer on 23 December 1966.

He spent half of his life in Canada, publishing and supporting banned Czech literature during the communist era. ≈†kvoreck√Ω was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 1980. He and his wife were long-time supporters of Czech dissident writers before the fall of communism in that country. ≈†kvoreck√Ω's fiction deals with several themes: the horrors of totalitarianism and repression, the expatriate experience, and the miracle of jazz. Life Born the son of a bank clerk in N√°chod, Czechoslovakia, ≈†kvoreck√Ω graduated in 1943 from the Re√°ln√© gymnasium in his native N√°chod. For two years in the Second World War he was a slave labourer in a Messerschmitt aircraft factory in N√°chod. After the war, he began to study at the Faculty of Medicine of Charles University in Prague, but after his first term he moved to the Faculty of Arts, where he studied philosophy and graduated in 1949. In 1951 he gained a PhD in philosophy. He then taught for two years at the Social School for Girls in Ho≈ôice v Podkrkono≈°√≠. Between 1952 and 1954 he performed his military service in the Czechoslovak Army. He worked briefly as a teacher, editor and translator in the 1950s. In this period he completed several novels including his first novel The Cowards (written 1948‚Äì49, published 1958) and The End of the Nylon Age (1956). They were condemned and banned by the Communist authorities after their publication. His prose style, open-ended and improvisational, was an innovation, but this and his democratic ideals were a challenge to the Communist regime. As a result, he lost his job as editor of the magazine Svƒõtov√° literatura (\\"World Literature\\"). ≈†kvoreck√Ω kept writing, and helped nurture the democratic movement that culminated in the Prague Spring in 1968. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that year, ≈†kvoreck√Ω and his wife, writer and actress Zdena Salivarov√°, fled to Canada. In 1971, he and his wife founded 68 Publishers which, over the next 20 years, published banned Czech and Slovak books. The imprint became an important mouthpiece for dissident writers, such as V√°clav Havel, Milan Kundera, and Ludv√≠k Vacul√≠k, among many others. For providing this critical literary outlet, the president of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, V√°clav Havel, later awarded the couple the Order of the White Lion in 1990. He taught at the Department of English at the University of Toronto where he was eventually appointed Professor Emeritus of English and Film. He retired in 1990. In Canada, he is considered to be a Canadian author despite the fact that he is mostly published in Czech. Literary works Most of ≈†kvoreck√Ω's novels are available in English: the novels The Cowards, Miss Silver's Past, The Republic of Whores, The Miracle Game, The Swell Season, The Engineer of Human Souls which won a Canadian Governor General's Award, The Bride of Texas, Dvo≈ô√°k in Love, The Tenor Saxophonist's Story, Two Murders in My Double Life, An Inexplicable Story or The Narrative of Questus Firmus Siculus, his selected short stories When Eve Was Naked and the two short novels The Bass Saxophone and Em√∂ke. A recurring character in several of his novels is Danny Smiricky, who is a partial self- portrait of the author. He wrote four books of detective stories featuring Lieutenant Boruvka of the Prague Homicide Bureau: The Mournful Demeanor of Lieutenant Boruvka, Sins for Father Knox, The End of Lieutenant Boruvka and The Return of Lieutenant Boruvka. His poetry was published as a collection in 1999 as ...there's no remedy for this pain (...na tuhle bolest nejsou pr√°≈°ky). His non-fiction works include Talkin' Moscow Blues, a book of essays on jazz, literature and politics, an autobiography Headed for the Blues, and two books on the Czech cinema including All the Bright Young Men and Women. ≈†kvoreck√Ω wrote for films and television. The feature film The Tank Battalion was adapted from his novel The Republic of Whores. Other features, written for Prague TV, include Eine kleine Jazzmusik, adapted from his story of the same name, The Em√∂ke Legend from a novella of the same name, and a two-hour TV drama Poe and the Murder of a Beautiful Girl, based on Edgar Allan Poe's story The Mystery of Marie Roget. Three very successful TV serials were made from his stories: Sins for Father Knox, The Swell Season and Murders for Luck. A film version of the novel Pastor's End was produced in 1968, but was never shown and went straight into locked Communist archives due to the fact that its author \\"illegally\\" fled the country. In the spring and summer of 1968 ≈†kvoreck√Ω and the Czech film director Milo≈° Forman jointly wrote a script synopsis to make a film version of The Cowards. After ≈†kvoreck√Ω fled the Warsaw Pact invasion the synopsis was translated into English, but no film was made. In the 21st century the English translation was translated back into Czech and has been published. Prominent in his writing for radio was a long- running monthly series on literature for Voice of America. From 1973 to 1990 he wrote more than 200 of these shows covering notable literary works and discussing literary themes. He died on January 3, 2012, in Toronto, Ontario, from cancer; he was 87 years old. Awards Among his numerous literary awards are the Neustadt International Prize for Literature (1980), the Canadian Governor General's Award for English-language fiction (1984), the Czech Republic State Prize for Literature (1999), the Prize of the Comenius Pangea Foundation \\"For Improvement of Human Affairs\\" (2001) which he received with the Polish film director Andrzej Wajda as well as the Angelus Award (2009). Nominated for the Nobel Prize in 1982. Awarded the Order of the White Lion by the President of Czechoslovakia, V√°clav Havel, 1990. In 1992 he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. ≈†kvoreck√Ω was a Guggenheim Fellow, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

He was proclaimed a National Hero of Jamaica in 1975 and his image is on the $50 Jamaican banknote. Biography Samuel Sharpe was born into slavery in the parish of St James, Jamaica, on a plantation owned by Samuel and Jane Sharpe around 1804. The Slave Return of 1832 announcing his death gave his name as Archer aka Samuel Sharpe, the son of Eve, and he was only 31 years old when he died. The Slave Return of Samuel and Jane Sharpe 1817 showed a young 12-year- old Archer on the plantation with his mother Juda Bligom and siblings Joe (two years old) and Eliza (20 years old). He was allowed to become educated. Because of his education, he was respected by other slaves. Sharpe became a well-known preacher and leader in the Baptist Church, which had long welcomed slaves as members and recognized them as preachers. He was a deacon at the Burchell Baptist Church in Montego Bay, whose pastor was Rev. Thomas Burchell, a missionary from England.Craton, Michael, Testing the Chains: Resistance to Slavery in the British West Indies (Cornell University Press, 1983), p. 299. Sharpe spent most of his time travelling to different parishes in Jamaica, educating the slaves about Christianity, which he believed promised freedom.  Baptist War  Slaves learned that the British Parliament was discussing abolition of slavery; those who could read followed such news closely. In the mistaken belief that emancipation had already been granted by the British Parliament, Sharpe organised a peaceful general strike across many estates in western Jamaica to protest working conditions. As this was the harvest of the sugar cane, it was a critical time for the plantation owners: generally the workforce had to work overtime to process the cane quickly at its peak. The Christmas Rebellion (Baptist War) began on 27 December 1831 at the Kensington Estate.Craton, Testing the Chains, p. 293. Reprisals by the plantation owners led to the rebels' burning the crops. Sharpe's originally peaceful protest turned into Jamaica's largest slave rebellion. The uprising lasted for 10 days and spread throughout the entire island, mobilizing as many as 60,000 of Jamaica's enslaved population.Craton, Testing the Chains, p. 291. The colonial government used the armed Jamaican military forces and warriors from the towns of the Jamaican Maroons to put down the rebellion, suppressing it within two weeks. Some 14 whites were killed by armed slave battalions, but more than 200 slaves were killed by troops. Afterwards, more reprisals followed. The government tried, convicted, and hanged many of the ringleaders, including Sharpe, in 1832. A total of 310 to 340 were executed through the judicial process, including many for minor offenses such as theft of livestock.Craton, Testing the Chains, p. 313. In the months leading up to his execution, while in jail, Sharpe had several meetings with Rev. Henry Bleby, a missionary, who reported that Sharpe told him: \\"I would rather die upon yonder gallows than live my life in slavery, than live a slave.\\"Bleby, Henry, Death Struggles of Slavery: Being a Narrative of Facts and Incidents Which Occurred in a British Colony, During the Two Years Immediately Preceding Negro Emancipation (1853), p. 116. The rebellion and government response provoked two detailed Parliamentary Inquiries. The Jamaican government's severe reprisals in the aftermath of the rebellion are believed to have contributed to passage by Parliament of the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act and final abolition of slavery across the British Empire in 1838.Craton, Testing the Chains, pp. 319‚Äì323.\\"Heroes  Samuel Sharpe\\", Jamaican Information Service.  Legacy  *In 1975, the government of independent Jamaica proclaimed Sharpe a National Hero, with the posthumous title of Rt.

The battle was the last between big-gun capital ships in the war between Britain and Germany. The British victory confirmed the massive strategic advantage held by the British, at least in surface units. It was also the second-to-last engagement between battleships, the last being the Battle of Surigao Strait in October 1944. Background Since August 1941, the western Allies had run convoys of ships from the United Kingdom and Iceland to the northern ports of the Soviet Union to provide essential supplies for their war effort on the Eastern Front. These endured much hardship, frequently attacked by German naval and air forces stationed in occupied Norway. A key concern were German Kriegsmarine battleships such as the and Scharnhorst. Even the threat of these ships' presence was enough to cause disastrous consequences for the convoys, such as Convoy PQ 17 that was scattered and mostly sunk by German forces after false reports of the Tirpitz sailing to intercept them. To ward off the threat of Germany's capital ships in the Arctic and with a high level of success escort convoys, the Royal Navy had to outlay great assets. Operation Ostfront was an attempt by the German Kriegsmarine to intercept the expected Arctic convoys. In late December 1943, there was a Russia-bound convoy JW 55B consisting of 19 cargo vessels under the command of the Commodore, retired Rear-Admiral Maitland Boucher, accompanied by a close escort of two destroyers, and , among others, and an ocean escort of eight Home Fleet destroyers led by . Also in the area was convoy RA 55A, returning to the United Kingdom from Russia, consisting of 22 cargo ships, accompanied by a close escort of two destroyers and four other vessels, and an ocean escort of six Home Fleet destroyers led by . It had arrived safely at Murmansk with its normal escorts and the additional protection by Force 1, commanded by Vice Admiral Robert Burnett, consisting of the cruiser , the flagship, and the cruisers and . Escorting the convoys to Russia was the responsibility of the Home Fleet and its commander- in-chief, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser. Fraser wished to neutralize Scharnhorst, a major threat to the convoys, and planned a confrontation over Christmas 1943 in which convoy JW 55B would be used to draw the enemy out. Fraser expected and hoped that Scharnhorst would attempt to attack JW 55B. At a conference of the captains of the ships in his force Fraser described his plan to intercept Scharnhorst at a position between the convoy and the enemy's Norwegian base. He would then approach the enemy to within in the Arctic night, illuminate Scharnhorst with star shell, and open fire using . Convoy JW 55B had left Loch Ewe on 20 December and was sighted two days later by a Luftwaffe aircraft which commenced shadowing. By 23 December it was clear to the British from intelligence reports that the convoy had been sighted and was being shadowed by enemy aircraft. Fraser then put to sea with Force 2 consisting of his flagship the battleship , the cruiser and S-class destroyers , , , and of the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy. Fraser was anxious not to discourage Scharnhorst from leaving its base, so did not approach before it was necessary to do so. As JW 55B and its escorts approached the area of greatest danger on the same day, the 23rd, travelling slowly eastward off the coast of north Norway, Burnett and Force 1 set out westward from Murmansk while Fraser with Force 2 approached at moderate speed from the west. On 25 December, Scharnhorst (under Captain Fritz Hintze) with the s , , , and left Norway's Altafjord under the overall command of Konteradmiral Erich Bey. Scharnhorst set course for the convoy's reported position as a south-westerly gale developed. Battle Contemporary map of the battle. Fraser received confirmation from the Admiralty in the early hours of 26 December that Scharnhorst was at sea and searching for convoy JW 55B. The stormy weather had resulted in the grounding of all Luftwaffe reconnaissance planes. With no ability to search for the British ships from the air and heavy seas hampering the movement of his ships, Rear Admiral Bey was unable to locate the convoy. Despite a German U-boat spotting the convoy and reporting its position, Bey was still not able to make contact with the British ships. Thinking he had overshot the enemy, he detached his destroyers and sent them southward to increase the search area, and the destroyers subsequently lost contact with their flagship. Admiral Fraser, preparing for the German attack, had diverted the returning empty convoy RA 55A northward, out of the area in which it was expected, and ordered JW 55B to reverse course to allow him to close. He later ordered four of the destroyers with RA 55A; , , and , to detach and join him. The now unescorted Scharnhorst encountered Burnett's Force 1 shortly after 09:00. Belfast was the first ship to obtain radar contact on Scharnhorst, and the British cruisers rapidly closed the range. At a distance of nearly , the British cruisers opened fire and Scharnhorst responded with her own salvoes. While no hits were scored on the cruisers, the German battleship was struck twice, with one shell destroying the forward Seetakt radar controls and leaving Scharnhorst virtually blind in a mounting snowstorm. Without radar, gunners aboard the German battleship were forced to aim at the enemy's muzzle flashes. This was made more difficult because two of the British cruisers were using a new flashless propellant, leaving Norfolk the relatively easier target. Bey, believing he had engaged a battleship, turned south in an attempt to distance himself from the pursuers and perhaps draw them away from the convoy. Scharnhorst's superior speed allowed Bey to shake off his pursuers, after which he turned northeast in an attempt to circle round them and attack the undefended convoy. Burnett, instead of giving chase in sea conditions that were limiting his cruisers' speed to , correctly guessed Bey's intentions and positioned Force 1 so as to protect the convoy. It was a decision that he had some personal doubts about as it would result in the cruisers losing contact with Scharnhorst, and the decision was criticised by some of the British force's other officers but supported by Fraser. To Burnett's relief, shortly after noon, Scharnhorst was once again detected by the cruiser's radars as it attempted to approach the convoy. As fire was again exchanged, Scharnhorst scored two hits on Norfolk with 11-inch shells, disabling a turret and her radar. Burnett's destroyers were also unable to get close enough to Scharnhorst to launch a torpedo attack on the German ship. Following this exchange, Bey decided to return to port, while he ordered the destroyers to attack the convoy at a position reported by the U-boat earlier in the morning. The reported position was out-of-date, and the destroyers missed the convoy. Scharnhorst ran south for several hours, once again taking advantage of its superior speed. Burnett pursued, but both Sheffield and Norfolk suffered engine problems and were forced to drop back, leaving the outgunned Belfast as the sole pursuer and dangerously exposed for a while. The lack of working radar aboard Scharnhorst prevented the Germans from taking advantage of the situation, allowing Belfast to reacquire the German ship on her radar set. Unbeknownst to Bey, his ship was now sailing into a trap with Admiral Fraser's main force steaming towards Scharnhorst's position and perfectly placed to intercept the fleeing German ship. With Belfast sending a constant stream of radio signals on the Scharnhorst's position, the battleship Duke of York battled through the rough seas to reach the German ship. Fraser sent his four escorting destroyers to press ahead and try to get into torpedo-launching positions. The main British force soon picked up Scharnhorst on radar at 16:15 and were maneuvering to bring a full broadside to bear. At 16:17 Scharnhorst was detected by Duke of Yorks Type 273 radar at a range of 45,500 yards (41,500 m) and by 16:32 Duke of Yorks Type 284 radar indicated that the range had closed to 29,700 yards (27,700 m). At 16:48, Belfast fired star shells to illuminate Scharnhorst. Scharnhorst, unprepared with her turrets trained fore and aft, was clearly visible from Duke of York. Duke of York opened fire at a range of and scored a hit on the first salvo disabling Scharnhorsts foremost turrets (\\"Anton\\" and \\"Bruno\\") while another salvo destroyed the ship's airplane hangar.Watts, p. 48. Turret \\"Bruno\\" was later brought back into action. Bey turned north, but was engaged by the cruisers Norfolk and Belfast, and turned east at a high speed of . Scharnhorst was now being engaged on one side by Duke of York and Jamaica while Burnett's cruisers engaged from the other side. The Germans took continuing heavy punishment from Duke of York's 14-inch shells, and at 17:24 a desperate Bey signalled to Germany \\"am surrounded by heavy units\\". A close up view of the damage received by from an 11-inch shell fired by Scharnhorst during the battle Bey was able to put some more distance between Scharnhorst and the British ships to increase his prospects of success. Two 11-inch shells from one of her salvoes passed through the masts of the Duke of York, severing all the wireless aerials, and more serious still, the wires leading from the radar scanner to the Type 284 gunnery control radar set. Lt H. R. K. Bates RNVR climbed the mast and managed to repair the broken wires, but these hits could not have been known to Bey, and his ship's fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse at 18:20 when a shell fired by Duke of York at extreme range pierced her belt armor and destroyed the No. 1 boiler room. Scharnhorsts speed dropped to only , and though immediate repair work allowed it to recover to , Scharnhorst was now vulnerable to torpedo attacks by the destroyers. Five minutes later, Bey sent his final radio message to the German naval command: \\"We will fight on until the last shell is fired.\\" At 18:50 Scharnhorst turned to starboard to engage the destroyers Savage and Saumarez, but this allowed Scorpion and the Norwegian destroyer Stord to attack with torpedoes, scoring one hit on the starboard side. As Scharnhorst continued to turn to avoid the torpedoes, Savage and Saumarez scored three hits on her port side. Saumarez was hit several times by Scharnhorsts secondary armament and suffered 11 killed and 11 wounded. Due to the torpedo hits, Scharnhorsts speed again fell to , allowing Duke of York to rapidly close the range. With Scharnhorst illuminated by starshells \\"hanging over her like a chandelier\\", Duke of York and Jamaica resumed fire, at a range of only . At 19:15, Belfast joined in from the north. The British vessels subjected the German ship to a deluge of shells, and the cruisers Jamaica and Belfast fired their remaining torpedoes at the slowing target. Scharnhorsts end came when the British destroyers Opportune, Virago, Musketeer and Matchless fired a further 19 torpedoes at her. Wracked with hits and unable to flee, Scharnhorst finally capsized and sank at 19:45 on 26 December, her propellers still turning, at an estimated position of . She was later identified and filmed at . Of her total complement of 1,968, only 36 were pulled from the frigid waters, 30 by Scorpion and six by Matchless. Neither Rear Admiral Bey nor Captain Hintze were among those rescued, although both were reported seen in the water after the ship sank, nor were any other officers. Scorpion tried to rescue Bey but he foundered. British casualties, in contrast, were relatively light with only 21 killed and 11 wounded. The majority of British casualties occurred on Saumarez, with 11 of the destroyer's sailors being killed as the ship attempted to close with Scharnhorst. HMS Norfolk suffered most of the remaining casualties with seven of her men being killed while the destroyer Scorpion also had one of its men missing in action. Fraser ordered the force to proceed to Murmansk, making a signal to the Admiralty: \\"Scharnhorst sunk\\", to which the reply came: \\"Grand, well done.\\" Aftermath Blindfolded Scharnhorst survivors come ashore at Scapa Flow on 2 January 1944 Later in the evening of 26 December, Admiral Fraser briefed his officers on board Duke of York: \\"Gentlemen, the battle against Scharnhorst has ended in victory for us. I hope that if any of you are ever called upon to lead a ship into action against an opponent many times superior, you will command your ship as gallantly as Scharnhorst was commanded today\\". Stord and Scorpion fired their torpedoes from an easterly direction. Stord fired her eight torpedoes as she was about from Scharnhorst, while also firing her guns. After the battle Admiral Fraser sent the following message to the Admiralty: \\"... Please convey to the C-in-C Norwegian Navy. Stord played a very daring role in the fight and I am very proud of her...\\". In an interview in The Evening News on 5 February 1944 the commanding officer of HMS Duke of York, Captain Guy Russell, said: \\"... the Norwegian destroyer Stord carried out the most daring attack of the whole action...\\". The loss of Scharnhorst demonstrated the vital importance of radar in modern naval warfare. While the German battleship should have been able to outgun all of her opponents save the battleship Duke of York, the early loss of radar-assisted fire control combined with the problem of inclement weather left her at a significant disadvantage. Scharnhorst was straddled by 31 of the 52 radar-fire-controlled salvoes fired by Duke of York. In the aftermath of the battle, the Kriegsmarine commander, Gro√üadmiral Karl D√∂nitz remarked, \\"Surface ships are no longer able to fight without effective radar equipment.\\" The sinking of the Scharnhorst was a major victory for the Allied war effort in the Arctic theater and further altered the strategic balance at sea in their favour. The Battle of the North Cape took place only a few months after the successful Operation Source, which had severely damaged the German battleship Tirpitz as she lay at anchor in Norway. With Scharnhorst destroyed and Germany's other battleships out of service, the Allies were now for the first time in the war free from the threat of German battleships raiding their convoys in the Arctic and Atlantic. This would allow the Allies to reallocate their naval resources that had been previously tied up to counter the threat of the German 'fleet in being'. This would prove to be the final battle of battleships in European waters and was one of few major surface ship-on-ship battles in the Second World War without air support.

In his A History of Rhodesia, Robert Blake writes that Smit's party, \\"in accordance with the Rhodesian tradition of adopting the most misleading political nomenclature possible, called themselves 'Liberals.'\\" The party was, in fact, pronouncedly illiberal, and attempted to unite conservative, non-trade union opposition to the UP while opposing government economic regulation and the advancement of Black political interests. The Liberal Party did well in the 1946 general election, winning 12 out of 30 seats in the Southern Rhodesia Legislative Assembly, but in the 1948 general election it won only five seats and its support declined subsequently. It was to become one of the political precursors to the future Rhodesian Front (RF) party.

History The UFP was formed in November 1957 by a merger of the Federal Party, which had operated at the federal level, and the Southern Rhodesian United Rhodesia Party.Assa Okoth (2006) A History of Africa: African nationalism and the de-colonisation process, East African Publishers, p108Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, United Federal Party Political Parties: A Cross-National Survey However, after conservative elements gained control of the party, the liberal faction led by Garfield Todd broke away to re-establish the United Rhodesia Party.Gabriel Abraham Almond & James Smoot Coleman (2015) The Politics of the Developing Areas, Princeton University Press, p312 In the 1958 general election in Southern Rhodesia, the UFP won 17 of the 30 seats, despite receiving fewer votes than the Dominion Party, whilst the URP failed to win a seat. In the federal election in November 1958, the UFP won 46 of the 59 seats. General elections in Northern Rhodesia in March 1959 saw the UFP win 13 of the 20 elected seats. In the August 1961 elections in Nyasaland the Malawi Congress Party won 22 seats (including two upper roll seats) and the UFP five (all from the upper roll). The next federal elections in March 1962 were boycotted by all other parties, allowing the UFP to win 54 of the 57 seats. However, that was the end of the UFP's success. In the Northern Rhodesian general elections in September the UFP won the most seats, but the Northern Rhodesian African National Congress, which held the balance of power, went back on a secret pact its leader Harry Nkumbula had made with the UFP and allowed the United National Independence Party to form the government. General elections in Southern Rhodesia in December 1962 saw the UFP defeated by the new Rhodesian Front; the UFP winning 29 seats to the Front's 35. In April 1963, the party was split into four; the federal branch was rebranded as the Federal Party and continued to be led by Roy Welensky, whilst the territorial branches became the National Progressive Party in Northern Rhodesia, the Nyasaland Constitutional Party in Nyasaland and the Rhodesia National Party in Southern Rhodesia, where it was led by Edgar Whitehead.JRT Wood (2012) So Far and No Further!: Rhodesia's Bid for Independence During the Retreat from Empire 1959-1965, Trafford Publishing, p146\\"U.F.P.

The national forest was established in 1908, incorporating the first San Bernardino National Forest and parts of the former Santa Barbara and San Gabriel National Forests. Angeles National Forest headquarters are located in Arcadia, California. Geography The Angeles National Forest covers a total of , protecting large areas of the San Gabriel Mountains and Sierra Pelona Mountains. It is located just north of the densely inhabited metropolitan area of Greater Los Angeles. While primarily within Los Angeles County, a small part extends eastward into southwestern San Bernardino County, in the Mount San Antonio (\\"Mount Baldy\\") area, and a tiny section also extends westward into northeastern Ventura County, in the Lake Piru area. The San Gabriel Mountains National Monument, established in 2014 and managed by the U.S. Forest Service, is largely within the Angeles National Forest. The John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 established the Saint Francis Dam Disaster National Memorial and Saint Francis Dam Disaster National Monument at and around the ruins of the St. Francis Dam in the Forest's San Francisquito Canyon. =Wilderness areas= The Angeles National Forest contains five nationally designated wilderness areas. Two of these also extend into neighboring San Bernardino National Forest: * Cucamonga Wilderness ‚Äî mostly in San Bernardino NF * Magic Mountain Wilderness * Pleasant View Ridge Wilderness * San Gabriel Wilderness * Sheep Mountain Wilderness ‚Äî partially in San Bernardino NF History The San Gabriel Forest Reserve was established on December 20, 1892, the San Bernardino Forest Reserve was established on February 25, 1893, and the Santa Barbara Forest Reserve was established on December 22, 1903. Together, they became National Forests on March 4, 1907, and they were combined on July 1, 1908, with all of the San Bernardino forest and portions of San Gabriel forest and Santa Barbara forest composing the new Angeles National Forest. On September 30, 1925, portions of the Angeles National Forest and the Cleveland National Forest were detached to re- establish the San Bernardino National Forest. Angeles National Forest is registered as California Historical Landmark #717, for being the first National Forest in the state. The campgrounds at Broken Blade, Twisted Arrow and Pima Loops were closed on July 26, 2013 after squirrel infected with bubonic plague was discovered. =Wildfires= 2014, new growth emerges after the fires of 2012 Loop Fire On 1 November 1966, a fire started at 5:19a.m. on the Los Pinetos Nike Site (LA-94). The fire spread, threatening medical facilities and residential areas south edge of the national forest. 12 firefighters with United States Forest Service's El Cariso \\"Hot Shot\\" crew were killed they were caught in a flare up in a canyon. 11 more firefighters were seriously burned in the incident. The fire was brought under control on at 1:00p.m. on 2 November, having burned . Station Fire In the Station Fire, more than of the forest were burned by an arson fire that began on August 26, 2009, near Angeles Crest Highway in La Ca√±ada and quickly spread, fueled by dry brush that had not burned for over 150 years. The fire burned for more than a month and was the worst in Los Angeles County history, charring , approximately one-fourth of the forest; displacing wildlife, and destroying 91 homes, cabins and outbuildings and the family-owned Hidden Springs Cafe. During the fire, two firefighters died after driving off the Mt. Gleason County Road looking for an alternate route to get the inmates out at Camp 16. The Station Fire threatened the Mount Wilson Observatory atop Mt. Wilson . The site includes two telescopes, two solar towers, and transmitters for 22 television stations, several FM radio stations, and police and fire department emergency channels. Although the fire scorched one side of the outhouse at amateur-owned Stony Ridge Observatory, six miles northeast of Mt. Wilson, aside from minor damage from smoke and ash infiltration, the remainder of the observatory and its historic 30-inch Carroll telescope survived. 2012 fires Several 2012 wildfires occurred, burning hundreds of acres across the forest-covered mountain range. Bobcat Fire (2020) Natural history The Angeles National Forest manages the habitats, flora and fauna ecosystems, and watersheds. Some of the rivers with watersheds within its boundaries provide valuable non-groundwater recharge water for Southern California. The existing protected and restored native vegetation absorb and slow surface runoff of rainwater to minimize severe floods and landslides in adjacent communities.Lockman, Ronald F., 1981. Guarding the Forests of Southern California: Evolving Attitudes Toward Conservation of Watershed, Woodlands, and Wilderness (Glendale: A. H. Clarke). The land within the forest is diverse, both in appearance and terrain. Elevations range from . The Pacific Crest Trail crosses the forest. =Flora= Various mountain plant life with the Chaparral yucca at right. Much of this National Forest is covered with dense chaparral shrub forests with oak woodlands, which changes to pine and fir-covered slopes in the higher elevations. Subsequent to the fire there was a heavy growth of poodle-dog bush, apparently triggered by the fire's effect on dormant seeds, that lasted for several years. The plant produces prolific lavender flowers. Unfortunately, as visitors to the Forest discovered, contact with it may cause a poison-oak-like rash. Tree species for which the forest is important include bigcone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa), Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri), and California walnut (Juglans californica). The National Forest also contains some of old growth, with: Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) forests and mixed conifer forests (Coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and white fir (Abies concolor)), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) the most abundant types. Fauna This forest is home to black bears, gray foxes, bobcats, cougars, mule deer, bighorn sheep, rattlesnakes and coyotes. Access A National Forest Adventure Pass is required for parking at many locations in the Angeles National Forest and other National Forests in Southern California, and this can be obtained online or from visitor centers and local merchants. Los Angeles County has declared that passes are not required on county-maintained roads. There are also many other areas that do not require the pass.

His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. Artistic theories At the very beginning of the 20th century Rudolf Belling‚Äôs name was something like a battlecry. The composer of the \\"Dreiklang\\" (triad) evoked frequent and hefty discussions. He was the first, who took up again thoughts of the famous Italian sculptor Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1570), who, at his time, stated, that a sculpture should show several good views. These were the current assumptions at the turn of the century. However they foreshadow an indication of sculpture being three-dimensional. Rudolf Belling amplified: a sculpture should show only good views. And so he became an opponent to one of the German head scientists of art in Berlin, Adolf von Hildebrandt, who, in his book, The problem of Form in Sculpture (1903) said: \\"Sculpture should be comprehensible ‚Äì and should never force the observer to go round it\\". Rudolf Belling disproved the current theories with his works. His theories of space and form convinced even critics like Carl Einstein and Paul Westheim, and influenced generations of sculptors after him. It is just this point which isn‚Äôt evident enough today. Departure from Germany From 1933 on, Belling had no chance to work in his home country. His works were marked degenerate, many of them were melted down or smashed. As his political opinions were also not in conformity with the Nazi regime, he was banned from working as well as from his membership of the Prussian Academy of Arts, Berlin. The academy president advised him in the name of the Minister of Education and Arts to resign. In 1935 Rudolf Belling stayed for eight months in New York City, where he had an exhibition in the Weyhe Gallery with his most important works from the Modern Classic Period. He also gave courses of lectures on modern sculpture and his own theories. America offered him a marvellous possibility at that time to live his life there. He returned to Germany because his nine-year-old son Thomas was in danger there since his mother, Rudolf Belling‚Äôs first wife, had been Jewish. He succeeded in saving his son and emigrated once again, in 1937, this time to Istanbul, Turkey. He lived and worked there for thirty years. From 1937 on he was professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul, re-organizing the department of sculpture and mediating introductions towards modern art, basing his work on traditional studies. In 1939 he managed to fly out his son illegally from Berlin to Turkey. In 1942 he married his second wife Yolanda Carolina Manzini, who was from an Italian-German family, and in 1943 his daughter Elisabeth was born. From 1951 to 1966, he was professor at the Istanbul Technical University, at the department of architecture. 1955, he got the Federal Cross of Merit. He was called back to the Academy in Berlin West only in 1956, the same year the works which stayed in New York could be received back with the help of the Foreign Office. At the age of eighty, he decided to return to Germany again, where he lived in Krailling, near Munich. He died in Munich in June 1972, being highly decorated by the German government with the Federal Cross of Merit with Star. The archive is meanwhile managed by his daughter Elisabeth Weber-Belling.

A fleet of more than a hundred ships of the United Provinces commanded by Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer, Lord Obdam attacked an English fleet of equal size commanded by James, Duke of York forty miles east of the port of Lowestoft in Suffolk. Although it was a substantial English victory, the escape of the bulk of the Dutch fleet deprived England of the chance of ending the war quickly with a single decisive victory. As a result, the Dutch were able to make good their losses by building new and better-armed ships and improving their organisation and discipline. Their Dutch fleets would not be so badly organised or ill-disciplined in the remaining battles of this war and, in Obdam's replacement, Michiel de Ruyter, the Dutch had gained a superb tactician and leader for the remainder of the war.  Background  The Second Anglo-Dutch War resulted from long-standing commercial tensions between England and the Netherlands.Rommelse, The Second Anglo-Dutch War, p.73 Despite diplomatic negotiations to avoid the outbreak of war, each country refused to compromise, and hostile acts by each side continued.Rommelse, The Second Anglo-Dutch War, pp.95, 98-9 The English ambassador in France reported that Louis XIV of France would probably evade his treaty obligations and refuse to be drawn into war with England if the Dutch could be provoked into declaring war: following English attacks on Dutch convoys, one off Cadiz and the other in the English Channel, the Dutch Republic did declare war on England on 4 March 1665.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.67-9 At the start of the war, both sides considered an early decisive battle was desirable, as English government finances could not sustain a long war, and as an English blockade of Dutch ports and attacks on their merchant and fishing fleets would soon bring about the ruin of the Dutch economy.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.69-70 After an early English blockade which took place in April and May was broken off through its ships' lack of supplies, the Dutch were desperate to prevent a second blockade. The Grand Pensionary and leading Dutch politician, Johan de Witt and other members of the States-General, formed a commission to supervise Obdam,Bruijn, The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, p.70 which gave him detailed instructions comprising 26 articles, ordering him to attack the English aggressively when and where he could do them most damage. However, these instructions gave Obdam little guidance on how he should do so.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.79, 83Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.287 Although the Dutch had ordered the construction of many new warships, during and after the First Anglo-Dutch War, including several comparable to the all but the largest English ships to augment the existing fleet, not all of these were completed or fitted out by 1665.Bruijn, The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, pp.64-6 To complete Oddam's fleet, eighteen older warships that had been laid up after the First Anglo-Dutch War were reactivated, and several very large Dutch East India Company built hybrid ships were added. These could be used for carrying cargo, as convoy escorts or in battle, although they were not as strongly built as pure warships.Bruijn, The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, p.74 Perhaps realising that his fleet was still too inferior in organisation, training, discipline and firepower to challenge the English successfully in a decisive battle, Obdam prepared to postpone the fight until the wind turned favourable in order to seek a limited confrontation, with his fleet in a defensive leeward position from which it could disengage quickly and return to its ports without openly disobeying orders.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.83-5 However, this opportunistic attitude and lack of a clear strategic plan was a significant cause of his defeat and death.Rommelse, The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667). p.131 The instructions issued by the commission headed by de Witt insisted on specifying that the Dutch fleet's order of battle should involve its division into a seven squadrons with a total of 21 flag officers for political reasons.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.79 Each of the five Dutch admiralties had its own set of flag officers, including many recently appointed ones. Each of the three smaller admiralties insisted on having its own squadron, so the larger Admiralties of Amsterdam and the Maas (i.e. Rotterdam) then split their forces in two squadrons, each of similar size to those of the smaller admiralties. This resulted in seven squadrons, each with three flag officers; several were led by Lieutenant Admirals of equal rank to Obdam, who commanded his own squadron as well as the whole fleet. As the seven squadrons were not subdivided, the 14 subordinate flag officers had no clear function, except as potential replacements for their leaders.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.288 In addition, several squadrons had ships or flag officers from more than one admiralty, complicating their chain of command.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.79-80 Both national fleets could only be made as large as they were by employing armed merchants: the English used 24 of these,Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.43-4 the Dutch twelve.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.46-7 On 11 June, a ship detached from the English fleet sighted the Dutch fleet sailing from the east with a light following breeze, and the fleet tried to close in on the Dutch against an adverse wind. At 4pm, the strength of the turning tide and a near calm forced the English fleet to anchor, and the Dutch did not make use of the favourable current to attack them, but also anchored, so avoiding battle that day.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.83-4 Obdam certainly wished to fight and had clear orders to do so, but an easterly breeze would prevent the Dutch fleet from retreating if it were outfought, and his waiting for a westerly breeze may have saved the bulk of the Dutch fleet from destruction by allowing it to withdraw after the resulting battle.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.85 On 12 June the wind again blew from the east, and again Obdam declined to attack, despite holding the weather gage. The two fleets sailed westward for most of the day, until the wind veered to a southerly, then a southwesterly, direction overnight. By dawn, the wind had strengthened and was from a direction between southwest and south, which slightly favoured the English fleet. Obdam decided to attack and he now approached the enemy, possibly fearing that if the wind became more westerly, it would favour the English fleet even more.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, pp.300-1 The English fleet of 109 ships carried 4,542 guns and 22,055 men; it consisted of three squadrons:Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.318-20 # Prince Rupert of the Rhine commanded the van, the White Squadron # James himself commanded the centre , the Red Squadron, and # Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, commanded the rearguard, the Blue Squadron The Dutch fleet of 103 ships carrying 4,869 guns and 21,613 men had no fewer than seven squadrons:Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.324-6 # First squadron, from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by van Wassenaer himself in # Second squadron, mainly from the Admiralties of Zeeland and the Maas, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral Johan Evertsen on Hof van Zeeland # Third squadron from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer on Groot Hollandia # Fourth squadron, mainly from the Frisian fleet with some East Indies Company ships, commanded by Lieutenant Admiral Auke Stellingwerf on Sevenwolden # Fifth squadron from the Admiralty of Amsterdam, commanded by Vice Admiral Cornelis Tromp on Liefde # Sixth squadron, mainly from the Admiralties of Zeeland and the Maas, commanded by Vice Admiral Cornelis Evertsen the Elder on Vlissingen and # Seventh squadron from the Admiralty of the Northern Quarter commanded by Vice Admiral Volckert Schram on Wapen van Nassau  Battle  = Morning = Battle of Lowestoft, by Hendrik van Minderhout. It is difficult to give a fully coherent account of the battle, and more so to recover the intentions of the commanders, particularly those of Obdam who did not survive the battle. He had, on 12 June, sent all of his silverware and other valuables home, which perhaps shows his state of mind.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.299 Although Obdam has been accused of lack both of leadership and tactical insight, masked in earlier battles where Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer, who had been promoted to be a lieutenant-admiral at Lowestoft, had been his flag captain.Bruijn, The Dutch Navy of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, p.73 Although the English found Obdam's behaviour puzzling, his tactical decisions may relate to his appreciation that his out-gunned, poorly organised fleet could only succeed in battle under ideal conditions and needed to be able to disengage if it risked defeat.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.83, 85 After their defeat, the surviving Dutch flag officers, in order to exonerate themselves, pretended their fleet had followed the original written orders, blaming misfortune and cowardice among the merchant captains for the disaster.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.124 In the early morning of the 13th, both fleets were about 40 miles southeast of Lowestoft, with the Dutch fleet southeast of the English fleet. The wind was described as a \\"fine chasing gale\\", implying a strong but not excessive wind, from a direction between southwest and south. Just before dawn, at around 4am, Obdam made a sudden westward dash to regain the weather gage, trying to pass to the south of the English fleet. In Sandwich's account, Sir Christopher Myngs, leading the English van, immediately moved southeast to prevent this, and was able to retain the weather gage, forcing the leading Dutch ships to steer northwest, the two fleets passing in opposite directions but at some distance. As Obdam's move surprised his own fleet, it was left in some confusion.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.85-6Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.302 An alternative interpretation was that the wind was blowing from the northwest and van Wassenaer tried to engage the English from a defensive leeward position. However, Warnsinck's detailed account from a Dutch perspective confirms a southwest wind was blowing.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, pp.302-3 During this first pass, the Great Charity (originally an Amsterdam Directors' ship the Groote Liefde, which was captured during the Battle of Portland in 1653) became isolated to the east of the Dutch line and was boarded and captured by captain Jan den Haen, the later admiral, who immediately returned with his prize to the Netherlands. This obviously unsound practice would be prohibited in the Dutch fleet after this battle.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.305 Another English ship, the merchantman John & Abigail was also isolated, but eventually managed to rejoin the English fleet.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.86 Later an English victory tune \\"The Dutch Armado A Meer Bravado\\" declared: \\"Fortune was pleasant when she lent the Dutch our 'Charity' a thing they wanted much.\\" After this, there was a second pass that needed each fleet to reverse course. Penn had inserted a new article in the fleet's Fighting Instructions requiring it to tack from the rear, so reversing the order of the fleet, but Penn later recounted that displaying the signal for this manoeuvre was delayed until after the Dutch fleet had already started to turn. Prince Rupert in the van, realising there was a problem, ordered his Red Squadron to reverse course while maintaining the same order, although his leading division under Myngs at first missed Rupert's signal. Penn then cancelled his first order and the Duke led the centre and rear of his squadron to the northwest, but his leading division under Lawson ignored his admiral's turn until the Blue Squadron under Sandwich began its own turn. This left a large gap to the rear of Rupert's White Squadron. Fortunately for the English, the Dutch fleet was sufficiently far to the north to be unable to take immediate advantage of this gap and, from 6am to 7am, the two fleets were not engaged.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.87-8 Penn's solution to the developing Dutch threat, was bold: soon after 7amWarnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.306 he steered the Royal Charles and the bulk of the Red Squadron to the west to form a second battleline to prevent Obdam gaining the weather gage. The Dutch made no attempt to do so, whether because of Penn's manoeuvre or because their ships could not steer sufficiently westward against a southwesterly wind. In addition, Sandwich's Blue Squadron had largely closed the gap left by Rupert's squadron,Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.307 and had formed in a rather disordered line behind him, with Lawson's division following Sandwich.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.88-9 The fighting during this pass was at a closer range than in the first one, and the Dutch ships attempted to break through the English line: although three of their ships temporarily succeeded, they were soon forced back.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.90 Once the whole Dutch fleet was opposite the English, James and Penn decided to attempt the manoeuvre of tacking from the rear a second time. This required careful coordination and timing, but it was achieved under fire, such that Lawson's division now led Sandwich, with Rupert in the rear.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, pp.306-7 Following this, the two fleets were now moving in the same northwesterly direction at the same speed from about 8am. Up to this point, casualties had been relatively light, but in the heavy fighting that followed, the Frisian commander, Lieutenant-Admiral Auke Stellingwerf, was cut in two and the veteran Lieutenant-Admiral Kortenaer, probably the most competent Dutch commander present, was fatally wounded, both by cannonballs. Quartermaster Ate Stinstra then took command of Kortenaer's ship.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.91-2Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.304 All reports of the stage of the battle from late morning to midday are fragmentary. Although the English fleet had become disarranged through executing its tacking manoeuvres, the Dutch were in greater disarray and many Dutch ships failed to remain in a coherent line of battle.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.91 In theory, their being in a leeward position would have given the Dutch guns greater range, allowing them to destroy the rigging of the English ships from a safe distance with chain shot, but in reality the seven squadrons began to block each other's line of fire. In addition, those flag officers and captains most hungry for battle quickly left the less enthusiastic officers and older ships behind, while company ships were untrained in the tactics of fighting in formation.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.86-7Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.309 As far as can be established, Kortenaer's squadron led the Dutch fleet, ranged against Lawson, followed by Johan Evertsen and Obdam, who were mainly opposing Sandwich's squadron, with Tromp and Cornelis Evertsen towards the rear, facing Rupert. The ships of the Dutch fourth and seventh squadrons were scattered throughout the line, and most of the English Red Squadron formed a separate line to the west of the main area of combat, remaining almost out of range of Dutch gunfire for several hours.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.92-4 Around midday, Lawson's flagship, the Royal Oak, left the line having suffered significant damage, with Lawson himself wounded. He was quickly replaced by Joseph Jordan, who soon returned the flagship to lead its division.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.93 = Afternoon = The long gunnery contest continued until around 2pm, with the Dutch putting significant pressure on the English Blue Squadron, while holding their own elsewhere, because much of the Red Squadron was largely inactive. However, James and Penn began to send reinforcements to assist Sandwich around noon. The fiercest fighting if the early afternoon was between Obdam's and Sandwich's squadrons, the latter of which was concentrating its fire and heavily damaging the opposing Dutch ships.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.310 Obdam's flagship Eendracht and about five other large Dutch ships tried to break through Sandwich's squadron, and men from the giant Dutch East Indies ship Oranje under its captain Bastian Senten boarded and temporarily took over one of Sandwich's ships, the Montague.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.94Leven en bedryf van den vermaarden zeeheld Cornelis Tromp, Graaf ..., Volume 1. However James and Penn sent the Old James of 68 guns under Earl of Marlborough against the Oranje, whiled he and Penn sailed the against the Eendracht in support of Sandwich's flagship . These reinforcements forced Senten to recall his boarders and the Dutch to abandon their attempted breakthrough: this attempt and its repulse created considerable disorder among the Dutch ships.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.94-5 Both Sandwich, who was close to the centre of the action and, simultaneously but independently, Rupert further away, noticed the Dutch disarray, and embarked on attacks which were to decide the outcome of the battle. Sandwich attempted to break through the Dutch centre and four of the Dutch ships trying to oppose him ran into one another. As these ships failed to surrender, they were later attacked an English fireship, and only one escaped being burned.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.313 Other Dutch ships retreated.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.95, 98 To the north, Tromp and Cornelis Evertsen tried to seize the weather gage from Rupert, who retained it while continuing to inflict severe damage to his opponents.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.95 While these two English attacks were taking place, the Duke of York attacked the Eendracht. A Dutch chain-shot from Obdam's flagship narrowly missed James and killed several of his courtiers on the Royal Charles, the Hon. Richard Boyle (son of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington), Viscount Muskerry and the Earl of Falmouth. The last, who was untalented and little regarded was decapitated, leading the poet Andrew Marvell, using the pseudonym John Denham) to write a brutal epitaph: \\"His shattered head the fearless Duke disdains, and gave the last first proof that he had Brains\\". However, casualties on the Eendracht were even more severe, with Obdam being killed on its quarterdeck by a cannon ball and, a few minutes after his death, at about 3pm, its magazine exploded without warning, destroying the ship and killing all but five of its crew.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.95‚Äì96 The loss of the flagship and death of its commander, just as the English Blue and White squadrons were attacking, seriously affected Dutch morale, which was further damaged by the uncertainty over his successor.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.315 The next most senior flag officer was Johan Evertsen of Zeeland, who was distrusted by the politicians of the dominant province of Holland, who had therefore nominated Egbert Kortenaer to be Obdam's successor before the battle. Kortenaer had been fatally wounded and was incapable of command, but Stinstra, his flag captain kept Kortenaer's flag as admiral of the third Squadron flying and, unnerved by the explosion of the Eendracht, he fled the battle, followed by many ships of that squadron, which assumed that they should follow their leader's flag. Seeing, as he thought, Kortenaer had abdicated his responsibility, Johan Evertsen raised a pendant showing he commanded the fleet, but Cornelis Tromp, the senior Amsterdam officer also raised a command pendant adding to the confusion, as three ships claimed to be fleet flagship. By this stage, any semblance of lines of battle had disappeared, and the battle took on the appearance of a gigantic and shapeless m√™l√©e, although the more aggressive English fleet was in fact forcing many of the Dutch ships, unnerved by the loss of the Eendracht or following Kortenaer's flag in the Groot Hollandia, to retreat. A complete Dutch rout was prevented only by what ships rallied to Evertsen or Tromp and the action of the Oranje, which fought off several opponents for around two hours until, shattered and sinking it surrendered and was burned.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, pp.316-7 These Dutch forces allowed the bulk of their fleet, which had lost all cohesion by around 6pm, to gain a headstart on any English pursuit. During this stage, the Earl of Marlborough and the Earl of Portland were killed and the ships of Lawson's division of the Red Squadron and Teddiman's division of the Blue Squadron joined the main battle forcing more Dutch ships to retreat.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.97‚Äì98, 100 Between 6pm and 9pm, the larger English ships concentrated, on forcing first Evertsen and then Tromp into retreat and mopping-up Dutch ships too damaged to escape, capturing three.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.98, 100 Tromp later claimed that his rearguard action prevented greater losses, as many of the fleeing Dutch ships' crews were demoralised and would not fight any English pursuers.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.318 As Sandwich had broken through the Dutch fleet, it disintegrated in its flight into a number of separate bodies, escaping to different ports. Tromp led one group to Texel, followed by Rupert, Johan Evertsen retreated with another contingent to the Maas pursued by the rest of the English fleet, and other ships headed for the Scheldt. However, the English commanders did not order a general chase by releasing their faster ships to overtake the slower of the Dutch fugitives, but remained in squadron. At around 9pm, Sandwich even ordered his squadron to shorten sail so that the White Squadron could catch up and the Duke of York assume command.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.98-9 Much more damaging, however, was the decision taken for the Royal Charles to reduce sail during the night. Significant controversy surrounds this incident, and several explanations have been proposed to explain it. An account which relies on the reported testimonies of Penn and Harman suggests that Lord Henry Brouncker, James' master of the bedchamber, either from fear or because he had promised the Duchess of York to keep the Duke from danger, first approached William Penn, the Captain of the Fleet asking him to slacken sail, reminding him that the Duke was heir presumptive and that his death would be a disaster. Penn refused, stating that only James could order this, but he then went below. Brouncker next approached the captain of the Royal Charles John Harman, this time pretending that the order to take in sail did come from James. When Royal Charles reduced sail in the course of the night, the rest of the English fleet followed suit.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.99 According to another account, Penn was said to have remarked that James, having narrowly escaped death in the battle, had lost his nerve completely. David Ogg, England in the Reign of Charles II (1936) p. 288. Brouncker later fled for his life rather than face a Parliamentary enquiry after the war, which could have condemned him. When, on the morning of 14 June, the fastest English frigates were sent ahead of the main fleet, they captured six Dutch ships, some of which defended themselves honourably, but others offered little resistance: these were in addition to three captures on the previous evening. The results of what had been a notable victory were less than might have been expected, firstly through the rearguard actions of Tromp and Johan Evertsen which allowed many Dutch ships to disengage from the battle and secondly the failure to release the faster frigates from the main fleet in pursuit of the fleeing Dutch, which could have been ordered as early as 6pm. These small but fast ships had taken little part in the main action, but their activities on the morning of 14 June showed what could have been achieved. The controversial slowing-down of the whole fleet at night simply exacerbated this earlier failure.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.99-100  Aftermath  The English lost only one ship, the captured Great Charity mentioned above. Eight Dutch ships were sunk by the English; six of these were burnt in two separate incidents when they got entangled while fleeing, and each group was set ablaze by a fire ship: this happened to the Tergoes entangling with the company ship the Maarseveen and the merchantman the Swanenburg; and also to the Koevorden, the Stad Utrecht and the Prinse Maurits. The earlier mentioned company ship the Oranje was set on fire after being reduced to a wreck when fighting off several English ships. The first to attack was one of the Duke of York's squadron, the Mary under captain Jeremiah Smith, which lost 99 men of its crew in this action, followed later by the , the and the . According to some accounts, the Oranje lost half of its crew of 400 before succumbing, a severely wounded Senten (rumoured to be an expatriate Scotsman) was picked up by an English vessel and shortly after he also died.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.97-8 During the Dutch flight, the English captured nine more ships: Hilversum, Delft, Zeelandia, Wapen van Edam and Jonge Prins; the VOC-ship Nagelboom and the merchants Carolus Quintus, Mars and Geldersche Ruyter. Tromp was captured but escaped. Eight older ships had to be written off later, as the costs of repairing them would have exceeded their value. The English fleet had lost one flag officer, Rear-Admiral Robert Samsun during the battle, while Vice-Admiral Lawson was mortally wounded and died three weeks after the battle. Notable English admirals and captains present at the battle included William Penn in the , Christopher Myngs and George Ayscue.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.100 The escape of most of the Dutch fleet was more significant than its losses, as only its destruction as a fighting force would have given England the early victory it needed. That possibility became more remote as senior Dutch sea officers and politicians began to consider the reasons for the disaster at Lowestoft, and identified three principal causes. The first was the lack of discipline that was dealt with by severely punishing the worst offenders while rewarding success.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.126‚Äì127 The second was tactical, as the favoured Dutch tactic of the undisciplined m√™l√©e, with individual ships boarding and capturing their opponent and, in many cases, leaving the battle with their prize, was ineffective against English gunnery on ships fighting in line. Although de Ruyter did partially revert to m√™l√©e tactics in the last day of the Four Days Battle.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.262, fighting in line became the standard tactic in new Fighting Instructions approved by the States General in August 1665.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.127-8 The final cause was the inferiority of Dutch ships which, though well-constructed, were generally smaller and more lightly armed than those of other maritime nations. Although there had been a significant building programme after the First Anglo-Dutch War, only Eendracht and Groot Hollandia, built as fleet flagship, were comparable to English ships of the third-rate. Although from 1660 the Dutch embarked on an expansion programme, many where smaller ships and only one exceeded the size of the Eendracht, equaling an English second-rate. This building programme was greatly expanded after the outbreak of the war, but none of its ships had been completed by the time of Lowestoft.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, pp.130-2 Compared with the Dutch fleet at the Four Days' Battle in June 1666, Obdam had a fleet comprising many older and smaller vessels and fewer modern ones. It relied strongly on the East Indies Company's ships and other merchantmen, although these did not have the resilience of true warships. There were no East Indies Company ships in the battles of 1666, and the few merchant ships present were not in the line of battle but acted as auxiliaries.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.132 Although Tromp and Evertsen were ordered by the commissioners from the States General to return to sea with as many ships as possible,Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.322 in the recriminations that followed the battle, Tromp refused, denouncing a number of captains for disobedience or cowardice, and the States General formed a commission to inspect the ships and question the captains of those that seemed to have suffered little damage. Although about two dozen ships showed were found to have suffered little damage, only ten captains were charged with cowardiceWarnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.324 Nine captains were brought to trial: three were shot before the fleet, three exiled and three dismissed from their commands.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, p.325 A tenth captain, Laurens Heemskerck, who had fled from the Netherlands in 1665, fearing he would be tried for cowardice in the battle, was afterwards condemned in absentia to perpetual banishment from the Netherlands. Heemskerck assisted England in planning the attack on the Vlie and later, in 1672, fought on the French side against his countrymen at the Battle of Solebay. A. J. Van der Aa, (1867). Biographische Woordenboek der Nederlandenen. p.349 Although there was considerable dissatisfaction with the conduct of a number of ships' crews, the States General did mot investigate these, considering that the fault lay with their captains. There were also disputes about who should be promoted to fill the places of the two deceased admirals.Fox, The Four Days Battle of 1666, p.101 The Dutch attempted to learn lessons from their defeat. The Admiralty of Zeeland instructed its flag officers and captains to avoid lengthy and disadvantageous gun battles and to practice drills aimed at boarding and capturing enemy ships, and in August 1665 the deputies of the States General in discussion with Tromp and other admirals issued revised combat instruction that became the basis of Dutch naval tactics for the rest of the Second Anglo-Dutch War and also for the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The main points of these instruction were the division of the fleet into three distinct squadrons, each with a clear chain of command, improved signaling and the application of the principle of the concentration of superior force against part of the enemy fleet. These instructions implicitly criticised the division of the fleet at Lowestoft into seven squadrons with unclear chains of command but also Obdam's cautious tactics.Warnsinck, Van Vloot Voogden en Zeeslagen, pp.325-6  See also  * Flagmen of Lowestoft  Footnotes   Bibliography  * Bruijn, Jaap R.

Tanker Ottawa launch, Wallsend shipyard, circa 1964 Swan Hunter, formerly known as Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson, is a shipbuilding design, engineering, and management company, based in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, England. At its apex, the company represented the combined forces of three powerful shipbuilding families: Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson. The company was responsible for some of the greatest ships of the early 20th century, most famously which held the Blue Riband for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic, and which rescued survivors from . In 2006 Swan Hunter ceased vessel construction on Tyneside, but continues to provide design engineering services. History Swan & Hunter was founded by George Burton Hunter, who formed a partnership with the widow of Charles Sheridan Swan (the owner of a Wallsend Shipbuilding business established in 1852 by Charles Mitchell) under the name in 1880. In 1903, C.S. Swan & Hunter merged with Wigham Richardson (founded by John Wigham Richardson as Neptune Works in 1860), specifically to bid for the important contract to build on behalf of Cunard. Their bid was successful, and the new company, Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd, went on to build what was to become, in its day, the most famous oceangoing liner in the world. Also in 1903 the Company took a controlling interest in the Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company, which was an early licensed manufacturer of Parsons steam turbine engines, which enabled Mauretania to achieve her great speed. Mauretania was launched from Wallsend on 20 September 1906 by the Duchess of Roxburghe.Maxtone-Graham, John (1972), Page 25, The Only Way to Cross. New York: Collier Books, The firm expanded rapidly in the early part of the twentieth century, acquiring the Glasgow-based Barclay Curle in 1912. In 1966 Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson merged with Smiths Dock Company to form Associated Shipbuilders, which later became Swan Hunter Group.Fears for Tyneside tradition as Swan Hunter ship is towed to Govan for completion Guardian, 15 July 2006 Following the publication of the Geddes Report recommending rationalisation in British shipbuilding, the Company went on to acquire Clelands Shipbuilding CompanyTyne & Wear Archives and John Readhead & Sons in 1967. Meanwhile, Swan Hunter inherited both the Naval Yard at High Walker on the River Tyne of Vickers-Armstrongs and the Hebburn Yard of Hawthorn Leslie in 1968. In 1973 further expansion came with the purchase of Palmers Dock at Hebburn from Vickers-Armstrongs. Then in 1977, Swan Hunter Group was nationalised as part of British Shipbuilders. The former flagship of the Royal Navy, was built at Swan Hunter during this period, entering service in 1985. The Company was privatised again in 1987 but decided to close its Neptune Yard in 1988.Royal Navy Ship may bring work for 100's Evening Chronicle, 30 August 2008 It was then forced to call in the receivers when the UK government awarded the contract for to Kvaerner Govan in 1993.Duce, Richard (1993-05-12). \\"Barrow ship order dismays Tyneside\\". The Times (Times Newspapers). The receiver took steps to break up the business. However, the main shipyard in Wallsend was bought out from receivership by Jaap Kroese, a Dutch millionaire. The yard subsequently undertook several ad-hoc ship repair and conversion projects for private-sector customers. A view of the Wallsend shipyard shortly after its closure In 2000 Swan Hunter was awarded the contract to design and build two (Auxiliary) Landing Ship Dock ships for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary with two other ships being built by BAE Systems Naval Ships: the cost of the two Swan Hunter ships was to be ¬£210 million including ¬£62 million for lead yard services, with an inservice date of 2004.Ministry of Defence Annual Report and Accounts 2004-05: Sixth Report of session 2005-06. Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Defence Committee. Page 29. 2006 By July 2006, the costs had risen to ¬£309 million and only one ship had been delivered. As result of this, the second ship was transferred to BAE Systems Govan in Glasgow for completion.Lyme Bay gets going at Govan Maritime Journal, 1 April 2007 In 2001 Swan Hunter acquired Kv√¶rner's Port Clarence offshore yard at TeessideShipbuilder Swan's sells Teesside yard The Journal, 13 April 2006 but then in 2006 sold it to Wilton Engineering Group.Ten years ago Port Clarence was an empty shell - now it's a hive of activity Evening Gazette, 27 May 2008 In November 2006, after the failure to complete Lyme Bay within budget and resulting exclusion from future Royal Navy shipbuilding projects, Jaap Kroese announced that the business was effectively finished and placed the Wallsend Yard's iconic cranes up for sale. He also said that he was actively looking for a buyer for the land. During this time, Lyme Bays earlier sister ship, Largs Bay, was noted as the last ship to be built and fully completed by Swan Hunter. In April 2007, Swan Hunter's cranes, along with its floating dock and other equipment, were sold to Bharati Shipyards, India's second-largest private-sector shipbuilder. The entire plant machinery and equipment from Swan Hunter was dismantled and transported to India over six months to be rebuilt at Bharati Shipyards.Bharati buys out UK shipyard major Swan Business Standard, 10 April 2007 Swan's performed the conceptual design of Pioneering Spirit, provisionally named Pieter Schelte, the world's largest platform installation/decommissioning and pipelay vessel.

In 2008 the company said it was concentrating on ship design with just under 200 people employed.People blame the MoD for Swan Hunter's decline, not me Evening Chronicle, 14 February 2008 In 2016, Jaap Kroese died but the company said it would continue with its business of ship design. At the time, the company had 40 employees and contractors. In 2016, Swan Hunter was relaunched into the subsea industry by Gerard Kroese, the eldest son of former owner Jaap Kroese. Swan Hunter started to offer specialist equipment, design, engineering & project management services to the offshore renewables and subsea oil & gas energy markets. On 12 October 2016, the company announced the issue of a letter of intent for the design and build of a basket carousel loading tower. The company announced further equipment pool growth through a 15Te tensioner and 450Te reel drive system. Swan Hunter announced loading tower readiness on 5 May 2017 with completion of mobilisation onto EMAS Chiyoda Subsea's multi-lay vessel 'Lewek Constellation' shortly thereafter. Operations The Company owned three main yards: * The Neptune Yard at Walker-on-Tyne inherited from Wigham Richardson (opened in 1860 and closed in 1988) * The Wallsend West Yard at Wallsend inherited from Charles Sheridan Swan (opened in 1842 and closed in 2006) * The Naval Yard at High Walker inherited from Vickers-Armstrongs (opened in 1912 and closed during the 1980s) All three were on the north side of River Tyne. The company also owned the Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company, the yard that built the engines for the Mauretania, from 1903 until the 1980s. At various times Swan Hunter also owned Palmers Hebburn Yard, Hawthorn Leslie Hebburn Yard and Readheads at South Shields which were all on the south side of the River Tyne.

It was created by publicity consultant Anthony Edwards and is organised by Rear of the Year Limited. It was for several years awarded to women only; now it is usually awarded to one woman and one man. History Barbara Windsor won the first award in 1976, presented as a one-off accolade. Five years later it became an annual event with Felicity Kendal receiving the honours. On winning the award in 1985, Lynsey de Paul quipped \\"I would like to thank the organisers from the heart of my bottom\\". In 1986, the award was presented to a man for the first time (Michael Barrymore) and 1991 saw Marina Ogilvy, the daughter of Princess Alexandra, became the first royal recipient. From 1997 the awards have been presented annually to both sexes. The 2002 award to Charlotte Church attracted controversy due to the winner having only just recently turned 16. 2010 winner Fiona Bruce accepted the award and participated in a photoshoot, happily posing for pictures in tight jeans. However, she subsequently described the award as 'the most hypocritical, ridiculous, ludicrous thing I‚Äôve ever done' The event, staged for some years at London's Dorchester Hotel in Park Lane, attracts national and international press publicity. In 2012, organiser Tony Edwards declared that female rears were starting to slim down as more women took to the gym, jogging, and keeping trim in this Olympic year. In 2014, Carol Vorderman became the first person to receive the award for a second time.

The event is held each August as one of the Edinburgh Festivals.  History and etymology  =Etymology= The term \\"tattoo\\" derives from a 17th-century Dutch phrase doe den tap toe (\\"turn off the tap\\") a signal to tavern owners each night, played by a regiment's Corps of Drums, to turn off the taps of their ale kegs so that the soldiers would retire to their billeted lodgings at a reasonable hour. With the establishment of modern barracks and full military bands later in the 18th century, the term \\"tattoo\\" was used to describe the last duty call of the day, as well as a ceremonial form of evening entertainment performed by military musicians. =Origins= The first public military tattoo in Edinburgh was entitled \\"Something About a Soldier\\" and took place in 1949 at the Ross Bandstand in the Princes Street Gardens. The first official Edinburgh Military Tattoo, with eight items in the programme, was held in 1950. It drew some 6,000 spectators seated in simple bench and scaffold structures around the north, south, and east sides of the Edinburgh Castle esplanade. In 2018, the stands were able to accommodate a nightly audience of 8,800, allowing 220,000 to watch the multiple live performances. =Seating expansion= Since the 1970s on average, just over 217,000 people see the Tattoo live on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle each year, and it has sold out in advance for the last decade. 30% of the audience are from Scotland and 35% from the rest of the United Kingdom. The remaining 35% of the audience consists of 70,000 visitors from overseas. The stands in place for the Tattoo of 2012 The temporary grandstands on the castle esplanade, used in 2018, had a capacity of 8,800. New ¬£16 million spectator stands and corporate hospitality boxes came into use in 2011. The new temporary stands reduced the time taken to erect and dismantle them from the original two months to one month, allowing the esplanade to host events at other times of the year. Performances The Tattoo performance takes place every weekday evening and twice on Saturdays throughout August and has never been cancelled due to inclement weather. However, in 2020 the performances were cancelled because of the worldwide onset of the Covid19 epidemics. Since 2012, each performance has included a fireworks display. From 2005 to 2015, a son et lumi√®re element projected on to the facade of the Castle. In 2016, the projection technology on the castle was upgraded to utilize modern projection mapping technology. In 2018, laser technology was used for the first time. Since 2004, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo has also held free abridged performances at the Ross Bandstand in Princes Street Gardens, entitled \\"Taste of the Tattoo\\", and as of 2008 also in George Square in Glasgow. The Edinburgh Military Tattoo has also toured overseas, visiting New Zealand in 2000 as part of the Tattoo's 50th anniversary celebrations. It visited Australia in 2005 and returned to the Sydney Football Stadium in February 2010 as part of the Tattoo's 60th anniversary celebrations. In February 2016 the Tattoo sold 240,000 tickets when it was staged in Wellington, New Zealand and Melbourne Australia. The performance was held at ANZ Stadium, Sydney in October 2019. There were also plans to take the show to China in 2020, with performances in Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. the Princess Royal was the patron of the event, with the main corporate sponsor being the Royal Bank of Scotland. In 2010 the event became the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo after HM Queen Elizabeth awarded the Royal title in celebration of its six decades of existence. The Bonnie Lass o' Fyvie being performed at the Edinburgh Military Tattoo 2007 =International exposure= In 2018 the Tattoo was planned to be televised to 40 countries allowing an estimated 100‚Äì300 million people see the event on television worldwide. In Britain the BBC broadcasts the event annually, with commentary in 2009 and 2010 provided by BBC Radio Scotland presenter Iain Anderson. Bill Paterson has provided commentary since 2011; before 2009 Tom Fleming commentated, not missing a year between 1966 and 2008. In Australia the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) traditionally telecasts the Tattoo on the evening of New Year's Eve, although in a break with tradition, the 2006 Tattoo was broadcast a day earlier on 30 December, the 2007 Tattoo was broadcast even earlier on Christmas Eve, and the 2009 Tattoo was broadcast two days after New Year's Eve on 2 January 2010. These changes were made so the ABC could expand its news coverage of local New Year celebrations. The Tattoo is run for charitable causes and in 2017 it was estimated that over the years has given ¬£10 million to the arts, military and civilian charities and organisations, such as the Army Benevolent Fund. However, the greater benefit has been that, by independent count, it generates ¬£88 million in revenue for Edinburgh's economy annually. The official magazine of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, Salute, is distributed free to sponsors, friends of the Tattoo, and visiting performers. =Performance structure= Each performance begins with a fanfare, usually composed for that year's show. The Massed Pipes and Drums then perform, marching through the gatehouse of the castle and performing a traditional pipe band set. Then, the show's featured acts perform individually.  Performers  The 2005 Edinburgh Military Tattoo celebrated Trafalgar 200 Each service is usually represented by bands from the British Armed Forces, along with drill and display teams as well. On special occasions, the Tattoo will feature bands from more than one service at the same time. In both 2002 and 2012, bands from all three services were featured to mark Elizabeth II's Golden and Diamond Jubilees. In 2003, the music of Westlife was featured at the event. From 1950 until 1994, the show mainly featured acts from military organizations. However, the show began to diversify and feature civilian acts beginning in 1995. While this was initially met with resistance from some fans, the inclusion of civilian acts has become more and more present in the show over time. One of the most popular acts featured at the Tattoo is the Top Secret Drum Corps from Basel, which has performed in the 2003, 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018 Tattoos. By 2018 performers from 48 countries had appeared in the tattoo since its inception. Since 2014, a house pipe band was introduced to allow individual pipers and drummers from not only Scotland but across many parts of the world to play in the Tattoo. Known as the Pipers' Trail, they join in with the massed pipes and drums each year and are the first pipe band with no military connections to play in the Tattoo. A stage band made up of volunteer musicians from around the world has been assembled for the 2019 program.

Tirumantiram's literal meaning is ‚ÄúSacred mantra‚Äù or \\"Holy incantation\\". The Tirumantiram is the earliest known exposition of the Shaiva Agamas in Tamil. It consists of over three thousand verses dealing with various aspects of spirituality, ethics and praise of Shiva. But it is more spiritual than religious and one can see the difference between Vedanta and Siddhanta from Tirumular's interpretation of the Mahavakyas.The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti), Volume 2, page 1625Saivism in Philosophical Perspective, page 31 According to historian Venkatraman, the work covers almost every feature of the siddhar of the Tamils. According to another historian, Madhavan, the work stresses on the fundamentals of Siddha medicine and its healing powers.A Short Introduction: The Tamil Siddhas and the Siddha Medicine of Tamil Nadu, page 7 It deals with a wide array of subjects including astronomy and physical culture.A dictionary of Indian literature, Volume 1, page 393 Analysis In short, the Tirumandiram, strongly emphasizes on Love is God, (Anbey Sivam).The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume Five (Sasay To Zorgot), Volume 5, page 3954 The Tirumantiram is divided into nine chapters, 9 tantras (tantirams); * 1. Philosophical views and divine experience, impermanency of the physical body, love, education etc. * 2. Shiva's glory, His divine acts, classification of souls etc. * 3. Yoga practices according to the eight-angled way of Patanjali. Also refers to Vaasi Yoga * 4. Mantra, tantra, etc. * 5. Various branches of Saiva religion; the four elements of Shaiva Siddhanta. * 6. Shiva as guru bestowing grace and the devotee's responsibility. * 7. Shiva linga, Shiva worship, self-control. * 8. The stages of soul experience . * 9. Panchadsara manthiram, Shiva's dance, the state of samadhi, etc. The poems have a unique metrical structure, each line consisting of 11 or 12 syllables depending on the initial syllable. Tirumular discusses the four steps of spiritual progress; Charya, Kriya, Yoga and Gnana, the Shaiva Siddhanta concept of Pati, Pasu and Pasa where Pati stands for Lord shiva, Pasu stands for the human kind and Pasa stands for Maya (the desire), sadhana, Vedanta, the Upanishadic Tat tvam asi and other Vedantic concepts, the transcendental reality as emptiness (Sunya) devoid of any attribute and Tantrasastra (Shakti worship), chakras, magic spells and their accessories. The section on Yoga, called \\"Shiva yoga\\", offers details not found in the Sanskrit text of Patanjali. The Tirumantiram describes means of attaining an immortal body (kaya siddhi), advocating a theory of preserving the body so that the soul would continue its existence (Udambai valarthen uyir valarthenae). Tirumular is not only one of the 63 Nayanmars (Nayanars) but also a significant one among the 18 Siddhars. Tirumular has been referred to as \\"Nampiran\\" (meaning: nam-Our, piran-God, thus thirumular has been called as a leader or god to all the remaining nayanars) by Sundarar in his thiru thondar thogai (the earliest song which mentions the names of 63 nayanars). Tirumular as a moral philosopher teaches the ethics of non-violence (ahimsa), abstinence from slaughtering, meat and alcohol. He condemns coveting another man's wife. He declares that \\"love is God\\", proclaims the unity of mankind and God and stresses the acquisition of knowledge. The final section of the Tirumantiram, named Sunya Sambhashana (\\"Colloquy on the Void\\"), is full of metaphorical sayings communicating mystical and speculative thoughts, for example; That's the superficial meaning. There is another meaning which should be understood. 1st Line: Says that in a seer's house there are five cows (Pancha budha's). The second word 'Agathiley' means, not inside the house; but inside a person (Agam-inside; Puram-outside) the house is compared to a person here. The five 'cows' are the five \\"pulans\\" the five \\"senses\\" (sensory organs and its functions:- Eyes - Vision,Reflexes - Feel/Touch, Ears - Hear, Tongue - Taste & Nose - Smell). So within a person exists the five senses. 2nd Line: There is no cattleman to control the animal. Because there is nobody (or nothing) to control them, they just roam \\"uncontrollably\\", here the five senses untamed, lead us to temptations! The five senses are untamed and roam uncontrollably. The five senses untamed is no less than a ferocious animal 3rd Line: If you know 'how to control' and if the 'rage' settles down, 4th Line: When the cows are tended by a cattleman all those five 'cows' will yield milk. Here the verses say that if all the five senses are controlled by a person it help one to get the \\"thiruvarul\\" which means \\"divine grace\\" (The five pulans are meant to be controlled to realise God) This is the actual meaning of the song. If the five 'pulans' control us it means it is untamed whereas if we control the five senses it means it is tamed. If these 'cows' are controlled then they yield 'milk'. Or if one can control the five 'pulans'/ 'senses', then that will lead one to God's Anuboodhi (being with God).

It was sometimes reinterpreted as no independence before majority African rule. In particular, this position was advocated with respect to the future status of Rhodesia as an independent state. British prime minister Harold Wilson was pressured into adopting the approach during a conference in London. Wilson was not initially inclined to do so, fearing it would slow the rate at which Rhodesia could be granted independence, but Lester Pearson, the Prime Minister of Canada, formulated a draft resolution committing Wilson to NIBMAR. Wilson defended the policy when it was attacked as disastrous by opposition Conservatives.House of Commons Hansard 20 December 1966 The accomplishment was short-lived, however, as Wilson continued to extend offers to Ian Smith, the Rhodesian Prime Minister, which Smith ultimately rejected.

Early life and career Butler was born in Coolah in rural New South Wales. He grew up in Sydney and was educated at Randwick Boys High School, the University of Sydney and the Australian National University, Canberra. He married Susan Ryan in 1963 and they had a son and a daughter; they divorced in 1972. Butler joined the Australian Department of External Affairs in 1965, and served in a number of postings until 1975, when he resigned to become Principal Private Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Gough Whitlam, who had recently been dismissed as prime minister. In 1983 the next Australian Labor Party Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, appointed him as Australia's Permanent Representative on Disarmament to the United Nations in Geneva. He was next appointed Australian Ambassador to Thailand, and played a major part in the Cambodian peace settlement, working closely with then Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. He was Australian Ambassador to the United Nations from 1992 to 1997. His term was ended by the new Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, after Butler's intensive lobbying had failed to win Australia a seat on the Security Council in 1996 (they were beaten by Sweden and Portugal). In his 2000 memoir The Greatest Threat, Butler acknowledged that his \\"high-energy, high- visibility activities ... had served as a distraction and clearly alienated some nations whose votes we might otherwise have won\\".Mark Riley, \\"Yes, the Butler did it: Why Australia lost top spot at the UN\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 27 May 2000, p. 17 Butler is currently a Global Diplomat in Residence and Clinical Professor at the Center for Global Affairs at the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies. He is also a professor in the School of International Affairs at Penn State University in State College, PA. Butler at UNSCOM In 1997 Butler was appointed Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), the UN weapons inspection organisation in Iraq, in succession to Rolf Ek√©us. In this role he antagonised both the Iraqi regime and the United States, and was frequently described as arrogant and aggressive. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan rebuked him for using \\"undiplomatic\\" language about then Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein. While at UNSCOM Butler frequently argued that Saddam had undisclosed weapons of mass destruction. In a 1999 speech he said: He also accused Iraq of actively concealing its weapons and obstructing UNSCOM's work: In a 1999 interview he said: In 1998 Iraq accused Butler and other UNSCOM officials of acting as spies for the United States, but the UNSCOM weapons inspectors were not expelled from the country by Iraq as has often been reported (and as George W. Bush alleged in his infamous \\"axis of evil\\" speech). Rather, according to Butler himself in his book Saddam Defiant (2000), it was U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, acting on instructions from Washington, who suggested Butler pull his team from Iraq in order to protect them from the forthcoming U.S. and British airstrikes. A number of media reports in the United States suggested that there was some substance to the spying allegations and to the charge that he was tailoring UNSCOM's findings to suit the United States. Eric Fournier, a French diplomat who served as Butler's deputy at UNSCOM in 1998, told an Australian journalist, Christopher Kremmer, that the US bombing of Iraq in 1998‚Äîwhich made the UNSCOM mission untenable‚Äîoccurred \\"because Richard Butler reported that the Iraqis had not cooperated with inspections, even though more than three hundred had taken place in a few weeks and only a handful had been a problem. Three out of three hundred did not go perfectly smoothly...the report, drafted like that, was a good excuse for some members of the Security Council to take action\\". Fournier also told Kremmer that Butler at one point sounded positive about closing the disarmament issue. But then he received a call from the state department who weren't happy with a positive outcome in Iraq. Both the Washington Post and the Boston Globe, citing anonymous sources, said that Butler had known of and co-operated with a US electronic eavesdropping operation that allowed intelligence agents to monitor military communications in Iraq. This was confirmed by UNSCOM insider Rod Barton on Australian television in February 2005. This intelligence was used to target US air attacks on Iraq. Butler admitted that foreign intelligence agencies were being used to locate Iraqi WMD but denied allegations that he colluded with the U.S. to access Saddam Hussein's private channel via \\"piggybacking\\" UNSCOM. He also stated that foreign intelligence activities decreased during 1998. He was publicly supported by Kofi Annan, but Annan was reported to be privately seeking Butler's resignation, which occurred a few months later. After leaving UNSCOM in 1999 Butler was a Diplomat-in-Residence at the Council of Foreign Relations. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Butler, despite his earlier criticism of Saddam Hussein, opposed the US-led invasion and Australian participation in it. In July 2003 he called for the resignations of Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who he said had misled the Australian people over the war. Governor of Tasmania =Appointment= In August 2003 the Labor Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon, announced the appointment of Butler as Governor of Tasmania. He was sworn in on 3 October. Although the office is largely ceremonial, Butler was paid an annual salary of A$370,000, higher than that for any other Australian state governor, and higher even than the governor-general's salary. His appointment was criticised on the grounds that he was not Tasmanian by either birth or association, that he was too closely identified with the Labor Party, and that he was a republican, and thus not a suitable person to represent the Queen of Australia, Elizabeth II, in Tasmania. The Melbourne daily The Age wrote: Butler sought to ease such fears by saying: \\"I will give no gratuitous offence to any monarchist. It would be pointless and offensive to do so. The day will come when the next part of the Australian story will be told, but in the meantime we get on with our story today and the process of building and making Tasmania grow.\\" He added: \\"I hope my international knowledge, my contacts, my experience in the global environment will enable me to make a contribution to the growing international awareness of Tasmania.\\" He married Jennifer Grey, his third wife, the day after he was sworn in as governor and commenced his term by leaving for a three-week overseas honeymoon. =Controversy= Criticisms of various kinds continued thereafter. When Butler broke with established vice-regal convention against public comment on domestic and international affairs, Premier Paul Lennon (who had replaced Jim Bacon in February 2004), specifically requested him to refrain from doing so. In August 2004, the Tasmanian Liberal Opposition Leader, Rene Hidding, withdrew his support for Butler, and a federal Labor Member of Parliament, Harry Quick, also criticised him. In the same week, three long-serving staff members at Government House resigned amid claims of difficulties in working with Butler and his wife. These departures occurred while Butler was once again on leave, this time for two weeks, during which time he made three public appearances in performances of Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait (a work for speaker and orchestra) with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Reporters tried to speak to Butler while on his way to rehearsals of this work, but were told to leave him and his wife alone as they were \\"on holiday\\". He was nevertheless billed for the performance as \\"The Hon Richard Butler, Governor of Tasmania\\". When asked for his view of the growing public controversy about Butler's performance and behaviour as governor, Prime Minister John Howard said he would not comment on a matter reserved for state authorities, but he nevertheless made the point, repeatedly, that \\"this was not my appointment\\". =Resignation= On 9 August 2004, after a three-hour meeting with Lennon, Butler announced his resignation, citing a desire to end a \\"malicious campaign\\" against him and his wife. Lennon said Butler had dealt with the situation \\"with honour\\" and that the decision to resign was \\"courageous and statesman-like\\". Butler's supporters held he had been hounded from office by monarchists and the Murdoch press; the Murdoch-owned Hobart newspaper The Mercury having run a series of articles critical of Butler's performance in the lead-up to his resignation. These aired such matters as his lengthy honeymoon, his alleged inability to get on with staff, and his allegedly arrogant and patronising manner. On 5 August The Mercury carried an article reporting the University of Tasmania political scientist Richard Herr as saying that \\"recent goings-on at Government House appeared inconsistent with legislation attached to the office of Governor.\\" Some of the matters raised included an alleged breach of protocol with the welcome of the Botswanan High Commissioner and a luncheon given for him, at which Jennifer Butler officiated. The point was made that the wife of a governor has no status in her own right during the governor's absence, and that this function should have been hosted by the Lieutenant- Governor, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Tasmania, the Hon William Cox. Upon Butler's resignation, William Cox was appointed acting governor. He was appointed Governor of Tasmania later that year. The day after Butler's resignation, Lennon said that he had offered Butler an ex gratia payment of A$650,000 in compensation for the loss of four years' expected income from the remainder of his five-year term. This payment, which was not constitutionally required, was widely criticised in the press and by the Tasmanian Opposition. Both the Prime Minister, John Howard and the federal Opposition Leader, Mark Latham, were critical of the payment, which Latham described as \\"sickening.\\" The Butler fallout resurfaced briefly in September 2005 following the release of Latham's diaries. Latham had earlier resigned as Federal ALP leader in January of that year amid acrimonious circumstances with his ALP colleagues. His diaries claimed that Lennon had discussed with him Butler's payout despite being publicly critical about it. Latham also wrote that Butler as Tasmania's governor was drunk at the 2004 Danish royal wedding and it cost him his job. Opposition Leader Rene Hidding questioned Lennon in Parliament about Latham's claims on the payout. Lennon dismissed what Latham wrote in his diaries saying that they are \\"a tirade of invective and abuse levelled at everybody and anybody who had anything to do with Mark Latham. The man has no credibility. Anything he says or writes has no credibility.\\"http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2005/s1466089.htm Honours Butler was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 1988 Australia Day Honours, \\"In recognition of service to international peace and disarmament\\".It's an Honour: AM On 5 September 2003, while Governor- designate of Tasmania, Butler was promoted to Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).It's an Honour: AC Bibliography * The Greatest Threat: Iraq, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and the Crisis of Global Security (). * Fatal Choice: Nuclear Weapons and the Illusion of Missile Defense () * Saddam Defiant: The Threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and the Crisis of Global Security (UK Version Publisher: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 25 May 2000. ) References External links *Richard Butler ‚Äì Exclusive to Saxton Speakers Bureau *Richard Butler interviewed on Conversations from Penn State *Butler's 1999 speech on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction *Butler interview on the work of UNSCOM and spying allegations *Tasmanian newspaper The Mercury article 5 August 2004 *News story on Butler's resignation as Governor of Tasmania *Governor of Tasmania ‚Äì Official site * Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Governors of Tasmania Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:University of Sydney alumni Category:Australian National University alumni Category:Australian republicans Category:Permanent Representatives of Australia to the United Nations Category:Permanent Representatives of Australia to the Conference on Disarmament Category:Ambassadors of Australia to Thailand ","title":"Richard Butler (diplomat)"},{"id":"887738","text":"Lesbian and Gay City Festival on Motzstrasse.

Motzstra√üe #6 was the location of the American Church from 1903 until 1944, when it was destroyed in an Allied air raid along with many other buildings in the area. The area around Motzstra√üe has been recognised as a gay-friendly neighbourhood for well over a hundred years, with many famous queer establishments, such as Piscator's Theatre (later Metropol Theatre), which later became the Metropol cinema, Metropol discothek, Goya club and is now known again as Metropol, the infamous Eldorado bar, and countless other gay venues which attracted large numbers of queer and open-minded clientele. The renowned British-American author Christopher Isherwood lived just around the corner from Motzstra√üe on Nollendorfstra√üe, where he was inspired by the area's diversity to write several of his best- selling novels.

In modern times it symbolises the county of Lancashire. The exact species or cultivar which it represents is thought to be Rosa gallica officinalis. The red rose was first adopted as a heraldic badge by John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of LancasterThomas Willement, Regal Heraldry: The Armorial Insignia Of The Kings And Queens of England, from Coeval Authorities, London, 1821, p.43 (1340-1399) third surviving son of King Edward III of England and father of King Henry IV, the first Lancastrian king, who seized the throne from his first cousin King Richard II. John of Gaunt's younger brother Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (1341-1402), adopted the White rose of York as his heraldic badge. Their respective descendants fought for control of the throne of England during several decades of civil warfare, which became known as the Wars of the Roses, after the badges of the two competing cadet royal houses. During the civil wars of the fifteenth century the red rose was the symbol of Lancastrian forces opposed to the rival House of York. The opposition of the two roses gave the wars their name: the Wars of the Roses, coined in the 19th century. The conflict was ended by King Henry VII of England who, being descended from both royal houses, symbolically united the red and white roses to create the Tudor Rose, the symbol of the Tudor dynasty. Flower Rosa gallica var. officinalis Lancaster's Red Rose (also known as Apothecary's Rose, Old Red Damask and Rose of Provins) is an official variety and is possibly the first cultivated rose. The rose grew wild throughout Central Asia and was discovered by the ancient Persians and Egyptians. Later adopted by the Romans, who introduced it to Gaul (France) where it assumed the name Rosa gallica. It is documented that Charlemagne's court exploited the rose as a perfume. The rose was also appreciated for its medical value and was utilized in countless medical remedies. Medieval symbol The Tudor Rose of England The Red Rose of Lancaster derives from the gold rose badge of Edward I of England. Other members of his family used variants of the royal badge, with the king's brother, the Earl of Lancaster, using a red rose.Henry Bedingfeld and Peter Gwynn-Jones, Heraldry, Chartwell Books, 1993, page 130. It is believed that the Red Rose of Lancaster was the House of Lancaster's badge during the Wars of the Roses. Evidence for this \\"wearing of the rose\\" includes land tenure records requiring service of a red rose yearly for a manor held directly from Henry VI of England.Guy Cardogan Rothery, Concise Encyclopedia of Heraldry, Brackten Books, 1915, page 183 There are, however, doubts as to whether the red rose was actually an emblem taken up by the Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses. Adrian Ailes has noted that the red rose ‚Äúprobably owes its popular usage to Henry VII quickly responding to the pre-existing Yorkist white rose in an age when signs and symbols could speak louder than words.\\" It also allowed Henry to invent and exploit his most famous heraldic device, the Tudor Rose, combining the so-called Lancastrian red rose and the White Rose of York. This floral union neatly symbolised the restoration of peace and harmony and his marriage in January 1486 to Elizabeth of York. It was a brilliant piece of simple heraldic propaganda.‚ÄùAdrian Ailes, ‚ÄúHeraldry in Medieval England: Symbols of Politics and Propaganda,‚Äù in Heraldry, Pageantry, and Social Display in Medieval England, ed. Peter Cross and Maurice Keen (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell, 2002), 83-104 (101). The Tudor Rose is used as the plant badge of England (Scotland uses the thistle, Ireland uses the shamrock, and Wales uses the leek). Later use A cobblestone mosaic showing the Red Rose of Lancaster in Williamson Park, Lancaster Lancashire's official coat of arms has three red roses The rose does not form any part of the insignia of the Duchy of Lancaster, but came to be seen as an emblem of the county of Lancashire, and as such was incorporated in the coats of arms of numerous Lancashire local authorities including the county council. Since 1974 a number of metropolitan boroughs in Greater Manchester and Merseyside have included red roses in their armorial bearings to show their formation from parts of Lancashire. It is also present in the crest of the coat of arms of the London Borough of Enfield. The traditional Lancashire flag, a red rose on a white field, was never officially registered with the Flag Institute and when this was attempted it was found that this flag had been registered by the town of Montrose, Scotland. As two flags of the same design can not be registered, Lancashire's official flag is now registered as a red rose on a yellow field. Today the Red Rose is still widely used, and not necessarily on a yellow background. Lancashire County Cricket Club still use the rose as an emblem. The Trafford Centre also features Red Roses in its architecture, most noticeably on all of the glass panes in the shopping centre. Lancashire GAA features a red rose on its emblem. Manchester City Football Club featured the red rose on the club badge from 1972 to 1997 and reinstated it in 2015, reflecting Manchester's history as part of Lancashire. It also features on the badges of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, and Barrow. Edge Hill University in Ormskirk uses the Red Rose on a yellow background on its crest along with a Liver bird which signifies its current location (Lancashire) and origins in Liverpool. The shield of Lancashire County Council's coat of arms, however, displays not one but three red roses, on gold piles on a red background. The arms have been official since 1903. Military use From the nineteenth century the red rose was part of the badge of a number of units of the British Army recruiting in the county. During the First World War, the rose was worn by 55th (West Lancashire) Division; their motto was \\"They win or die, who wear the Rose of Lancaster\\". When the division was reformed in 1920, it maintained the rose as its insignia. The cap badge of the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, formed in 2006, features the rose. The Saskatoon Light Infantry of the Canadian Army also incorporated the red rose into the design of their cap badge and regimental buttons, due to an alliance with the York and Lancaster Regiment of the British Army. International use The Canadian city of Montreal has a Lancastrian rose in the top right hand corner of its flag, representing the city's historical English community. Anglo-Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania), including the Red Rose of Lancaster The U.S. City of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, known as \\"Red Rose City\\", uses the Lancastrian rose as its seal, and in its flag.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1910 through 1927, during which he played for the Cleveland Naps, New York Yankees, Washington Senators and Chicago White Sox. Nap Lajoie discovered Peckinpaugh as a high school student, and signed him to his first professional contract. Peckinpaugh debuted with the Naps, who traded him to the Yankees in 1913. He managed the Yankees for 20 games in 1914 and was the team captain for the remainder of his time with the club. The Senators acquired Peckinpaugh, where he continued to play until his final season, spent with the White Sox. After his playing career, Peckinpaugh managed the Indians from 1928 through 1933 and in 1941. He was also a minor league baseball manager, and served in the front office of the Indians and Buffalo Bisons from 1942 through 1947. Peckinpaugh was considered an excellent defensive shortstop and strong leader. When he managed the Yankees, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He was named American League Most Valuable Player in 1925. He played in the World Series three times: winning the 1924 World Series with the Senators, losing the 1921 World Series with the Yankees, and losing the 1925 World Series with the Senators. Early life and amateur career Peckinpaugh was born in Wooster, Ohio, the third child of Frank and Cora Peckinpaugh. His father played semi-professional baseball. At a young age, the Peckinpaughs moved from Wooster to Cleveland. He attended East High School, where he played American football, basketball, and baseball. There, Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Naps, who lived in the same neighborhood, discovered Peckinpaugh. Lajoie signed Peckinpaugh to a contract with a salary of $125 per month ($ in current dollar terms) when he graduated from high school in 1910. Playing career =Cleveland Naps and New York Yankees (1910‚Äì1921)= The Naps started Peckinpaugh's professional career by assigning him to the New Haven Prairie Hens of the Class-B Connecticut League. He was promoted to the Naps to make his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut in September 1910, playing in 15 games for the Naps at age 19. The Naps assigned Peckinpaugh to the Portland Beavers of the Class-A Pacific Coast League for the entire 1911 season. He appeared in 70 games for the Naps in 1912, batting only .212. On May 25, 1913, after giving the starting shortstop position to Ray Chapman, the Naps traded Peckinpaugh to the New York Yankees for Jack Lelivelt and Bill Stumpf. Larry Doyle (right) of the New York Giants The Naps soon regretted the trade. With the Yankees, Peckinpaugh emerged as a team leader. He was named captain in 1914 by manager Frank Chance. Chance resigned with three weeks remaining in the season, and Peckinpaugh served as player‚Äìmanager for the remainder of the season; at the age of 23, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He finished the 1914 season fifth in the AL with 38 stolen bases. Peckinpaugh with the New York Yankees Bill Donovan was hired as the Yankees manager in the offseason. In the 1914‚Äì15 offseason, Peckinpaugh considered leaving the Yankees to join the Federal League, as he received offers from the Chicago Federals, Buffalo Blues, and Indianapolis Hoosiers. After considering the offer from Chicago, he chose to stay with the Yankees, and received a three-year contract worth $6,000 ($ in current dollar terms) per season from 1915 through 1917. He resigned with the Yankees in 1918. Peckinpaugh tied Buck Weaver for fourth in runs scored (89) and several players for eighth in home runs (7) in the 1919 season. By the 1921 season, Peckinpaugh was one of three players, along with Wally Pipp and Bob Shawkey, remaining with the Yankees from the time Jacob Ruppert and Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston purchased the team in 1915. The Yankees reached the World Series in 1921, losing to the New York Giants. Peckinpaugh set an MLB record for most assists in one game by a shortstop with nine. =Washington Senators and Chicago White Sox (1922‚Äì1926)= Peckinpaugh was traded twice during the 1921‚Äì22 offseason. On December 20, 1921, the Yankees traded Peckinpaugh with Rip Collins, Bill Piercy, Jack Quinn and $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) to the Boston Red Sox for Bullet Joe Bush, Sad Sam Jones and Everett Scott. On January 10, 1922, Pecknipaugh was involved in a three-team trade involving the Red Sox, Washington Senators and Philadelphia Athletics, where Peckinpaugh joined the Senators, Joe Dugan and Frank O'Rourke went to the Red Sox, and the Athletics acquired Bing Miller, Jos√© Acosta, and $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Though team owner Clark Griffith had indicated that Peckinpaugh would serve as his player-manager at the time of the trade, he named Clyde Milan player-manager for the 1922 season instead. This distracted Peckinpaugh, and along with injuries, limited his performance. Chance, now managing the Boston Red Sox, attempted to acquire Peckinpaugh from the Senators before the 1923 season. Remaining in Washington, Peckinpaugh rebounded during the 1923 season with timely hitting and solid fielding. Peckinpaugh tagged out at home in the mid-1920s Griffith appointed Bucky Harris as manager before the 1924 season. Harris considered Peckinpaugh his \\"assistant manager\\". Peckinpaugh was a key contributor in the 1924 World Series, in which the Senators defeated the Giants. He won the League Award as the AL's Most Valuable Player in 1925, edging Al Simmons by a small margin. In the 1925 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Peckinpaugh committed eight errors in the seven-game series, an MLB record. On January 15, 1927, the Senators traded Peckinpaugh to the Chicago White Sox for Leo Mangum and Sloppy Thurston. However, his playing time with the White Sox was limited by a leg injury. He acted as an advisor to manager Ray Schalk. After one season with the White Sox, Peckinpaugh retired as a player. Managerial and executive career Peckinpaugh was named manager of the Cleveland Indians after the 1927 season. After the Indians fell from first to fifth place during the 1933 season, the Indians fired Peckinpaugh, replacing him with Walter Johnson. After being considered for the Detroit Tigers' managerial vacancy that offseason, Peckinpaugh took over as manager of the Kansas City Blues of the Class-AA American Association for the 1934 season. Out of professional baseball in 1935, Peckinpaugh joined Lew Fonseca on nationwide baseball tours, which involved the viewing of a movie and technical demonstrations. He applied to be manager of the Boston Bees for the 1938 season, but the job was given to Casey Stengel. Peckinpaugh returned to professional baseball as the manager of the New Orleans Pelicans of the Class-A1 Southern Association in 1939. The Indians rehired Peckinpaugh as their manager in 1941, signing him to a two-year contract; team president Alva Bradley, who fired Peckinpaugh in 1933, promised Peckinpaugh full cooperation and minimal interference. After the 1941 season, he was promoted to vice president, later serving as Cleveland's general manager (GM) and president. When Bill Veeck bought the Indians in July 1946, he brought Harry Grabiner and Joseph C. Hostetler with him to serve in the front office. Peckinpaugh and Bradley resigned. Peckinpaugh succeeded Harris as GM for the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in the 1946‚Äì47 offseason. He was fired after the 1947 season, as the team's directors felt Peckinpaugh didn't sufficiently develop a farm system. Personal Peckinpaugh was considered a calm baseball player and manager, who did not let his temper get the best of him. After the end of his baseball career, Peckinpaugh worked as a manufacturer's representative for the Cleveland Oak Belting Company. He retired in 1976 at the age of 85. Suffering from cancer and heart disease, he was brought to a hospital for a respiratory condition, and died on November 17, 1977 in Cleveland. He was buried in Acacia Masonic Memorial Park in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. His wife, Mildred, died five years earlier. Together, they had four sons. Peckinpaugh was survived by two of his sons.

Greensand or green sand is a sand or sandstone which has a greenish color. This term is specifically applied to shallow marine sediment that contains noticeable quantities of rounded greenish grains. These grains are called glauconies and consist of a mixture of mixed-layer clay minerals, such as smectite and glauconite mica. Greensand is also loosely applied to any glauconitic sediment. Formation Greensand forms in anoxic marine environments that are rich in organic detritus and low in sedimentary input. Having accumulated in marine environments, greensands can be fossil-rich, such as in the late-Cretaceous deposits of New Jersey. Occurrence Important exposures are known from both northern and western Europe, North America, southeastern Brazil and north Africa. Well known and important greensands are the Upper and Lower Greensands of England and occur within Eocene and Cretaceous sedimentary strata underlying the coastal plains of New Jersey and Delaware. Although greensand has been found throughout Phanerozoic and Late Precambrian sedimentary deposits, it appears to be most common in Eocene, Cambrian, and Cretaceous sedimentary deposits. = Brazil = In Brazil, greensand refers to a fertilizer produced from glauconitic siltstone units belonging to the Serra da Saudade Formation, Bambu√≠ Group, of Neoproterozoic/Ediacaran age. The outcrops occur in the Serra da Saudade ridge, in Alto Parana√≠ba region, Minas Gerais. It is a silt-clay sedimentary rock, laminated, bluish-green, composed of glauconite (40‚Äì80%), potassium feldspar (10‚Äì15%), quartz (10‚Äì60%), muscovite (5%) and minor quantities of biotite (2%), goethite (<1%), titanium and manganese oxides (<1%), barium phosphate and rare-earth elements phosphates (<1%). Enriched levels of potash have K2O grades between 8% and 12%, thickness up to and are associated to the glauconitic levels, dark green in color. Glauconite is authigenic and highly mature. The high concentration of this mineral is related to a depositional environment with a low sedimentation rate. The glauconitic siltstone has resulted from a high level flooding event in the Bambu√≠ Basin. The sedimentary provenance is from supracrustal feldsic elements on a continental margin environment with an acidic magmatic arc (foreland basin). =Great Britain= In Great Britain, greensand usually refers to specific rock strata of Early Cretaceous age. A distinction is made between the Upper Greensand and Lower Greensand. The term greensand was originally applied by William Smith to glauconitic sandstones in the west of England and subsequently used for the similar deposits of the Weald, before it was appreciated that the latter are actually two distinct formations separated by the Gault Clay. The Upper Greensand was also once known as either the \\"Malm\\" or \\"Malm Rock Of Western Sussex\\" Both Upper and Lower Greensand outcrops appear in the scarp slopes surrounding the London Basin and the Weald. Prominent seams are to be found in the Vale of White Horse, in Bedfordshire, in Kent, Surrey, the South Downs National Park, elsewhere in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, and the Jurassic Coast in Dorset. The soil of the greensand is quite varied, ranging from fertile to fairly sterile. On the fertile soils chestnut and stands of hazel and oak are common, while Scots pine and birch colonise the poorer soils. These Greensand Ridges are popular long distance walking routes, for instance the Greensand Way in Kent. A sample of Cretaceous greensand from near Swanage, Dorset. Lower Greensand The Lower Greensand (known as the Woburn Sand north of the London Basin) is of Aptian age. In the Weald the Lower Greensand consists of four deposits which are partly diachronous: the Atherfield Clay thick, the Folkestone Beds thick; the Hythe beds thick and the Sandgate Beds thick. Although it appears both north and south of the London Basin it is not present everywhere beneath the Chalk Group which underlies the basin; the Gault lies directly on eroded Jurassic or Devonian rocks under much of the area. Upper Greensand The Upper Greensand is of Albian age. It represents a sandy lithofacies deposited in areas of stronger currents than the Gault Clay. Like the Lower Greensand it is not present beneath the whole of the London Basin, apparently passing laterally into Gault clay east of a line between Dunstable and Tatsfield and of uncertain extent to the east of London. Outcrops of the Upper Greensand occur in the southwest of England including the Blackdown Hills and East Devon Plateau and the Haldon Hills, remnants of a once much wider extent. Properties and uses The green color of greensand is due to variable amounts of the mineral glauconite, an iron potassium silicate with very low weathering resistance; as a result, greensand tends to be weak and friable. It is a common ingredient as a source of potassium in organic gardening and farming fertilisers. Greensand glauconite is used as a water softener for its chemical-exchange properties. Greensand coated with manganese oxide (called manganese greensand) is used in well water treatment systems to remove dissolved (reduced) iron and manganese with the addition of an oxidant, usually potassium permanganate, under controlled pH conditions. It is also used as a type of rock for stone walls in areas where greensand is common. In Roman times in Britain, coarse grits derived from the lower greensand were used to line the inner surface of mortars (grinding bowls) produced in Oxfordshire pottery kilns. Recently, glauconitic greensand has become a popular organic soil amendment.

Many types of waves in the ULF frequency band can be observed in the magnetosphere and on the ground. These waves represent important physical processes in the near-Earth plasma environment. The speed of the ULF waves is often associated with the Alfv√©n velocity that depends on the ambient magnetic field and plasma mass density. This band is used for communications in mines, as it can penetrate the earth.HF and Lower Frequency Radiation - Introduction Earthquakes Some monitoring stations have reported that earthquakes are sometimes preceded by a spike in ULF activity. A remarkable example of this occurred before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California, although a subsequent study indicates that this was little more than a sensor malfunction. On December 9, 2010, geoscientists announced that the DEMETER satellite observed a dramatic increase in ULF radio waves over Haiti in the month before the magnitude 7.0 2010 earthquake. Researchers are attempting to learn more about this correlation to find out whether this method can be used as part of an early warning system for earthquakes. Earth mode communications ULF has been used by the military for secure communications through the ground. NATO AGARD publications from the 1960s detailed many such systems, although it is possible that the published papers left a lot unsaid about what actually was developed secretly for defense purposes. Communications through the ground using conduction fields is known as \\"Earth-Mode\\" communications and was first used in World War I. Radio amateurs and electronics hobbyists have used this mode for limited range communications using audio power amplifiers connected to widely spaced electrode pairs hammered into the soil. At the receiving end, the signal is detected as a weak electric current between a further pair of electrodes. Using weak signal reception methods with PC-based DSP filtering with extremely narrow bandwidths, it is possible to receive signals at a range of a few kilometers with a transmitting power of 10-100 W and electrode spacing of around 10‚Äì50 m.

They have corresponding wavelengths of 10,000 to 1,000 kilometers. This frequency range includes the frequencies of AC power grids (50 hertz and 60 hertz). Another conflicting designation which includes this frequency range is Extremely Low Frequency (ELF), which in some contexts refers to all frequencies up to 300 hertz. Because of the extreme difficulty of building transmitters that can generate such long waves, frequencies in this range have been used in very few artificial communication systems. However, SLF waves can penetrate seawater to a depth of hundreds of meters. Therefore, in recent decades the U.S., Russian and Indian militaries have built huge radio transmitters using SLF frequencies to communicate with their submarines. The U.S. naval service is called Seafarer and operates at 76 hertz. It became operational in 1989 but was discontinued in 2004 due to advances in VLF communication systems. The Russian service is called ZEVS and operates at 82 hertz. The Indian Navy has an operational ELF communication facility at the INS Kattabomman naval base to communicate with its Arihant class and Akula class submarines.http://www.janes.com/article/11147/india-makes-headway-with-elf- site-construction The requirements for receivers at SLF frequencies are less stringent than for transmitters, because the signal strength (set by atmospheric noise) is far above the noise floor of the receiver, so small, inefficient antennas can be used. Radio amateurs have received signals in this range using simple receivers built around personal computers, with coil or loop antennas connected to the PCs sound card. Signals are analysed by a software fast Fourier transform algorithm and converted into audible sound.

Plot Cassie Harrison, a 13-year-old girl, is searching the universe for her father after he was kidnapped by space pirates. To help her, she enlists the aid of the only bounty hunter she can afford, a talking blue hamster named Marion. They have an odd-couple style relationship and search the universe together for Cassie's father. The blue space ship the pair use is divided into two parts, a driving cockpit which can be detached in order to fly down to a planet in a similar manner to a jolly boat from a vessel, and a larger booster component which is attached on top of the small driving compartment. Scenes involving driving often show large objects and rooms that appear within the ship. The name of the ship is Keith. Running gags include Marion pulling many, or odd, objects from his cheeks as if they are large pockets. In one instance he pulls out a large assortment of objects to help him and Cassie when they are falling off a cliff and this includes a cruise ship. Also, one of the science fiction references is the gag in which C-3PO from Star Wars appears in the ship and Cassie asks who he is. Every episode starts with a brief explanation of the basic running plot and features a sequence showing Cassie's father being taken away. This is followed by a short sequence showing Marion being uncovered from a 'tough' armoured outfit and standing on stilts. The next sequence features the screen divided into four quarters, each showing several different scenes from episodes. The credits culminate in Marion uttering a fierce growl. The closing credits show an image of stars in space. The tune to the theme sounds like the words 'bounty hamster' but with notes to a 3-4 beat. Despite airing in a children's timeslot, the show has quite a broad appeal, containing frequent science fiction references, in-jokes and puns, as well as nods to other movies and TV series. Marion's name and eyepatch is a parody of John Wayne and the character he played in True Grit. The show's premise is also based on True Grit - a young girl loses her father and then hires a bounty hunter. Characters *Marion, the hamster (voiced by Alan Marriott) - Marion is a blue talking hamster. He wears an eyepatch on his right eye (Which is purely for aesthetic, as he has both eyes) and can fit all manner of objects within his cheek cavities. He is often outraged by stronger characters calling him 'cute' and tries to defend his personality despite his feminine name and small structure and this is when he says his catchphrase Don't call me CUTE! before going berserk. He is often seen as being clumsy or forgetful with the exception of comedic instances such as when he remembers to use a remote controlled locking device on his space ship. *Cassie Harrison (voiced by Juliet Cowan) - Cassie (short for Cassiopeia) wears a white shirt and green trousers with an oddly shaped waist that opens at the top and then becomes thinner to the belt. These have darker green patches on her knees and pockets on either side. She wears grey shoes with white rubber soles. She has dirty blonde hair and is usually the more rational of the pair. She is constantly searching for her father and complaining at Marion's foolishness. Episodes In addition, A.I. (Artificial Idiocy), an episode between The Lost World and Planet of the Japes was originally slated to air as episode 21; but due to budget cuts at CITV, the episode was never made and was replaced by The Trial, a low-budget clip show episode. According to co-creator Alan Gilbey, the episode would have involved a past friend of Marion now hunting the duo down in a starship.

Later she served in World War II as APD-6. She was the second ship named for Silas Horton Stringham. Stringham was laid down on 19 September 1917 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company. The ship was launched on 30 March 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Edward B. Hill. The destroyer was commissioned on 2 July 1918, Commander N. E. Nichols in command. Service history =World War I= Following commissioning, Stringham was assigned to convoy escort and antisubmarine duty through the end of World War I. Upon her return to the United States in 1919, she was assigned to Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 6 of the Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Force. Except for a six-month period from December 1919 to June 1920 when she was in reduced commission, Stringham remained fully active with the Atlantic Fleet until the middle of 1922. During that time, alpha-numeric hull numbers were adopted by the Navy; and Stringham was redesignated DD-83 effective 17 July 1920. On 2 June 1922, she was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. =World War II= She remained inactive until 1940, when she was apparently moved to the Norfolk Navy Yard for conversion to a high-speed transport (APD). On 2 August 1940, Stringham was redesignated APD-6. 1940-1942 On 11 December 1940, she was recommissioned at Norfolk, whence she operated until mid-1942. Her duties consisted primarily of escorting coastal convoys from point to point along the eastern seaboard and to various bases in the Caribbean Sea. On 18 April 1942, Stringham attacked an enemy submarine, but could not confirm a kill, even though heavy black oil surfaced soon after her attack. On the following day, she put into Norfolk and participated in amphibious exercises in Chesapeake Bay through the first week in July. On 6 July, she got underway from Norfolk in company with a convoy bound for the Panama Canal. She transited the canal on 13 July, reported to the Commander, Southeastern Pacific, and continued west. After stops in the Society and Fiji Islands, she reached Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, on 14 August. Two days later, she put to sea on the first of many resupply voyages to help bolster the marines defending the beachhead on Guadalcanal. The Guadalcanal campaign was unique among the amphibious operations conducted in the Pacific during World War II. Neither the United States nor Japan enjoyed the overwhelming naval superiority which in almost every other case ensured victory for the greater force. Relative equality made the naval forces of each side a constant threat to the supply lines of the other. Consequently, both sides relied upon the high-speed transport, converted destroyers like Stringham, which were well armed for transports and fast enough to evade more powerfully armed warships. While the contribution of the larger elements of the American fleet cannot be overlooked, the struggle for Guadalcanal was to a great extent the battle of the high-speed transport. Stringham and similar high speed transports succeeded where their Japanese counterparts failed. They kept the marines supplied. On 23 August, during Stringhams second run to Guadalcanal, a torpedo passed her close astern; and she immediately charged to the attack. She dropped 11 depth charges; forced the submarine to broach; and then lost contact. Although her crew thought at the time they had sunk the submarine, subsequent checking failed to verify their victory. Not long after her scrape with the submarine, Stringham was ordered out to join the group of ships attempting to tow the destroyer , torpedoed the previous evening, into Tulagi. The imminence of the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, however, forced that weak formation to abandon Blue and seek shelter. Accordingly, Blue sank at 2223 on 23 August. Stringham resumed her supply runs in the Solomons until 5 October, when she got underway from New Caledonia to return to the California coast. 1943 After six weeks in the Mare Island Navy Yard, she got underway for the South Pacific. Her return to action, however, was short-lived for‚Äîwhile operating in Pepasala Bay in the Russell Islands on 26 February 1943‚Äîa heavy squall forced her aground on a reef. In maneuvering clear of the reef, she was forced to back down to avoid a collision with the destroyer and damaged her starboard propeller. After emergency repairs at Tulagi, she was routed back to Mare Island, where she arrived on 16 April. Over the next six months, Stringham advanced up the Solomons staircase with the American forces. In mid-August, she participated in the landings at Vella Lavella in the central Solomons. That operation cut the Japanese supply lines to Kolombangara and delivered vital air bases to the Americans. On 27 October, she and six other APDs, along with various smaller ships, put a force of New Zealanders ashore at Mono and Stirling islands in the Treasury Islands sub-group. November found her supporting the assault on Bougainville at Empress Augusta Bay. On the day after Christmas, Stringham joined the American forces which outflanked the Bismarck Barrier at Cape Gloucester, near the western terminus of New Britain. From that position, they could move in two directions‚Äîwest to pounce upon the back of the New Guinea hen or north to the Admiralties to isolate Kavieng and Rabaul. Stringham participated in one operation in each direction. 1944 On 2 January 1944, she supported the forces which landed at Saidor, New Guinea; and, in March, she assisted in the invasion of Emirau. Between these two operations, Stringham helped land troops in the Green Islands, the northernmost subgroup of the Solomons, located between Buka and New Ireland. During the spring of 1944, American military thinking focused increasingly upon the Central Pacific invasion route to Japan. Accordingly, Stringham returned to Hawaii with marines embarked; and both she and her passengers commenced preparations for the invasion of the Marianas. The initial waves of assault troops stormed the beaches at Saipan on 15 June. Stringham discharged her marines the following day and patrolled off Saipan throughout the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. On 22 June, Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) 7 shifted to her from for the Tinian phase of the Marianas operation. Until the landings, the high-speed transport conducted sporadic bombardment and harassment fire on Tinian. On 10 July, she sent her UDT men ashore to reconnoiter the two potential landing sites; and, just before the actual assault began on 24 July, her frogmen participated in a daylight feint at Tinian Town to divert Japanese attention from the actual landing sites. On 28 July, she completed her work with UDT 7 in the Marianas and headed for Espiritu Santo, via Eniwetok Atoll. Stringham, was at Purvis Bay, Florida Island, in the midst of exercises preparatory to the invasion of the Palaus when UDT 7 rejoined her on 5 September. By 12 September, she and her frogmen were off the coast of Angaur with Task Group 32.5. At 1035, she disembarked the UDT men at Peleliu to clear a path through heavy minefields. That afternoon, she towed to Kossol Passage, and then returned to work with the UDT teams until 27 September, when she headed for Manus. There she was moored alongside . On the night of 3 October, a fire broke out on Clemson and swept across Stringham amidships and aft, igniting the UDT teams' rubber boats and bags of explosives. Stringham drifted from her moorings after the lines were cut, and her crew finally got the fire under control. 1945 Stringham returned to the United States for overhaul, repairs, and alterations. She did not return to the western Pacific until 17 March 1945. She joined the southern defense group at Saipan and sortied with it for Okinawa on 26 March. The high-speed transport arrived off Okinawa on 2 April, the day following the initial assault, and screened the transport area until 7 April, when she headed for Guam. During that time, Stringham took two kamikazes under fire, one on 3 April and one on 6 April. The former succeeded in crashing while the latter gave up his plunge in the face of Stringhams heavy antiaircraft fire, dove on a destroyer, but missed both American ships. Stringham screened another convoy from Guam to the Ryukyus, reaching Okinawa on 22 April. She remained in the vicinity for five relatively uneventful days; then headed back to Guam. On this voyage, she rendered assistance to the hospital ship, , which had been crashed by a Japanese kamikaze. Comfort was able to resume course without assistance, but Stringham shepherded her until relieved by . While at Guam, Stringham was rammed by , a battle casualty. The APD's starboard side was damaged, as was her bridge, her forward crew's compartment, and much of her electrical equipment. Because of this, Stringham was ordered back to San Diego for extensive repairs. On 19 June, she entered San Diego and began conversion back to a destroyer; and, on 25 June, she resumed her former designation, DD-83. In August, the end of the war brought a halt to Stringhams conversion. Later that month, it was determined that she would be decommissioned at Philadelphia. In September, she sailed from San Diego, transited the Panama Canal, and preceded to Philadelphia, where she reported for duty to the Commandant, 4th Naval District, on 26 September. She was decommissioned on 9 November 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 5 December 1945. Stringham was scrapped at Philadelphia in March 1946. Awards Stringham was awarded nine battle stars for World War II service.

From 1975‚Äì1999, it was part of the Zamo≈õƒá Voivodeship administrative district. The town serves as the seat to the Gmina Szczebrzeszyn district. A 2004 census counted 5,357 inhabitants. It lends its name to the Szczebrzeszyn Landscape Park. Szczebrzeszyn is often called as the \\"Capital City of Polish Language\\".  History  = Early history = Szczebrzeszyn's history can be traced back to 1352, during the reign of Casimir III, although archaeological evidence suggests the area had been settled for several centuries prior to this. Neighboring villages named in Nestor's 11th century chronicle of Rus further support that Szczebrzeszyn is much older, once lying beside a major commercial route running from south to north. By 1492, trade had developed enough to warrant a special act imposed by Jan Olbracht. The Act specified which roads Szczebrzeszyn merchants could use when traveling through Lesser Poland with their wares. As merchants traveled through Szczebrzeszyn, they paid set taxes which proved to be an excellent source of revenue. For example, the tax on a wagon with merchandise was 2 groschen, on an ox: 1 groschen, and on a wagon with salt from Drohobycz: a measure of salt. After Jan Amor Tarnowski of Tarn√≥w's death in 1500, Szczebrzeszyn stayed in the hands of the Tarnowski family for the next 20 years. Later it was included in a dowry to the Kmita family. At that time, long-running feuds among family members re-ignited over the Szczebrzeszyn inheritance, while other magnates laid claims at this time. King Zygmunt August issued a binding decree to end this dispute in 1555, which allocated rights over the city to the Gorka family of Greater Poland. The Gorkas took a strong interest in religious matters, and granted freedom to all religious groups. They built a Greek Orthodox church, transformed the Roman Catholic parish church into a Calvinist one, and opened a synagogue nearby. Well-known supporters of the Reformation from Szczebrzeszyn, Stankar and Felix Kreutziger, sought the protection of these feudal lords. During this time, Szczebrzeszyn reached the highest levels of development. = Rise and fall = A variety of reasons led to the halting of development and, later, a steep decline. In early September, 1583, a fire swept through the castle keep, which destroyed all of the documents relating to privileges granted by Andrzej Gorka. These privileges were quickly renewed by the reigning king, Stefan Batory. The Gorkas also confirmed and expanded the Magdeburg Laws, which benefited the citizens. The last of the Gorkas, Stanislaw, died in 1592, after which the Szczebrzeszyn estates were taken over by the Czarnkowski family. In 1593, Jan Zamoyski purchased Szczebrzeszyn, along with 35 surrounding villages, and integrated them into his Ordinate. Zamoyski founded a new capital city in his Zamo≈õƒá estates, and it was at this point that Szczebrzeszyn lost its significance and the decline began. Despite the focus on Zamo≈õƒá, Zamoyski funded the Monastery of the Holy Franciscans and next to it the Cloister of the Holy Trinity, the modern day Cloister of Saint Katarzyna. Apart from this, he liquidated the Catholic Temple and returned the one-time parish Cloister to the Catholics. During the 17th century, religious animosity increased, and a 1637 decree issued by Tomasz Zamoyski resulted in the expulsion of the Arians. The city was also assaulted by the Tatars, Turks, and Cossacks. In particular, the city was torched and plundered by Tatars in 1672. A multitude of epidemics decimated the population and victims of the Plague were taken to a separate cemetery outside of the city. At the time of the partition of Poland, Szczebrzeszyn had fallen into the hands of Austria. = New development = The beginning of the 19th century saw a renewed interest in Szczebrzeszyn. With Zamo≈õƒá no longer functioning as the seat to the Zamoyski estates, the family transferred several functions to the city. The relocation of the provincial school and Holy Mercy Hospital stimulated growth and new buildings were constructed to accommodate the increasing population. The Chief Physician was moved here, and a hospital treating peasants for venereal diseases also opened. Education became an important part of life in Szczebrzeszyn. The district school was under the direct oversight of Stanis≈Çaw Zamoyski who recruited both talented teachers and students. Lady Teofilia Reder opened a private school for girls that taught many advanced subjects. Due to the strength of the schools and the direction of Stanis≈Çaw Zamoyski, Szczebrzeszyn suffered less from the politics of Russification than other settlements did after the November Uprising. For this precise reason, Russian authorities disbanded the provincial school in 1852. = During the uprising = Pedagogue Wincenty Dawid wrote in his 1887 memoir about the November Uprising: > \\"In the end, our tranquillity and working lives were disrupted and the model > order of the Szczebrzeszyn schools was wrecked.

For years afterward, local residents were arrested under suspicion for being a part of the uprising. = Russification methods = After the failure of the Uprising, the Russian authorities began to implement a severe policy of Russification, supplanting things which were not Russian. Elderly people were asked to record their recollections of that time, but as the majority were illiterate, younger literate townspeople often had to transcribe oral recollections of their elders. The war interrupted these efforts. The persecution of the Uniates was dramatic. An elderly peasant from Zurawnica told of a frightful scene, when one of his neighbors, a Uniate, agreed to accept the Russian Orthodox faith. The protests of his wife had no effect. Everything was arranged, all the formalities settled, but when the peasant was about to begin the communion ceremony, his wife went mad from mental confusion, and attacked the priest. This had a fearful effect on her husband, who refused to complete the ceremony. Being much taken by these tales, effort was made to assemble details about the Uniates in Szczebrzeszyn. A notice from the year 1843 announces that the parish of the Uniates was very poor, because it had 'a small number of adherents to the Szczebrzeszyn church (tserkva).' In December 1877, the priest, Aleksander G√≥rski‚Äîwho, it appears, did not belong to the resistance fighters‚Äîsigned his letter as the 'Rector of the Szczebrzeszyn Orthodox Parish.' It was at that time that the Uniates and the Greek Catholic Church were liquidated, and was transformed into a Russian Orthodox church. Later on, the priest Timofei Tracz came as Rector, and a sorrowful era was initiated for the Polish Catholics, particularly the Uniates. Although the Rector himself was once a Uniate priest, he voluntarily converted to the Russian Orthodox church and became an ideological Russifier and disseminator of his new faith. He led an ascetic existence, and his activities had a fanatical character. Over time, he became extremely influential as he became known to the highest institutional authorities. Everyone in the Zamo≈õƒá region feared him. He met with little resistance in his efforts to spread the Russian Orthodox faith, and he used any method necessary: promises, chicanery, threats, and violence. Documents in the Zwierzyniec archives confirm that there never were any Russian Orthodox faithful residing year-round in Szczebrzeszyn, with the exception of officials, who would sometime spend time here. Apart from the Russian Orthodox church, which had been transformed, as previously mentioned, from a Greek- Catholic church, the Catholic Church near the hospital was remade as a Russian Orthodox church in 1883. The number of adherents to the Russian Orthodox parish grew quickly in proportion, and in that time totaled 486 individuals. In the year 1905, in the first two months after the publication of the Tolerance Manifesto, 4,195 people in the Szczebrzeszyn parish converted from Russian Orthodoxy to the Roman Catholic faith, and 402 people from the outskirts of Zamo≈õƒá. The Tolerance Declaration was a severe blow to Tracz, as it undid all his efforts. He resisted the desertion, but to no avail; his health was damaged and he died in 1909. During World War I, the Muscovites left Szczebrzeszyn and both Orthodox churches were locked down. The entire Russian Orthodox parish appeared to disappear; townspeople even changed the spelling on the grave stones of their kin, from Russian to Polish, in order to erase all traces of their former church affiliations. Even Tracz's gravesite and memorial were eradicated. In accordance with an order from the bailiff, someone during the night broke down the monument, and Trascz's coffin was transferred from the churchyard to the public cemetery. The Rector of the Roman Catholic parish was at that time the priest, Grabarski. He was very popular, and known for his philanthropic activities‚Äîeven for the benefit of Jews. He was very much beloved by the Jews. For many years, prayers were offered in synagogues on his behalf. Life in Szczebrzeszyn during the time of the Russian rule was miserable. The pressure of rule was felt heavily from the side of the Russian authorities. Community activity was minimal: there was no manner of spiritual movement. Despite this, a certain amount of conspiratorial activity did continue, such as illegal study. Certain organizations did exist: Mlodziez Szkolna, N.D., P.P.S. The external character of Szczebrzeszyn was set down by the military; a Cossack battalion was stationed in the town. When World War I, military marched through the shtetl: Russian, Austrian, Russians again, and later a long time of Austrian occupation. Many forms of orientation manifested themselves: pro-Moscow, pro-Austrian, initiatives for independence. Part of the young people went off to military legions. = The Holocaust = Between 3,000 and 4,000 Jews lived in Szczebrzeszyn when the German Army occupied the city in 1939. Isaac Beshevis Singer's grandmother, Tema Blima Szejner, was from the city. Singer mentions his grandmother Tema in his autobiographical novel 'In My Father's Court'. On October 14, 1939 -- in spite of the fact it was the Jewish Sabbath -- the Germans ordered the Jews to clean the streets for the entire day. They treated them brutally by cutting or tearing off their beards, cursing them, and beating them. In mid-October, a police force was formed in Szczebrzeszyn -- composed of 60 men -- and was instructed to persecute the Jewish population of the city. Several hundred Jews from Kalisz and Wloclawek were re-settled in Szczebrzeszyn. The Judenrat was forced to provide several dozen men for work in Zamo≈õƒá each day. According to a Polish doctor in the town, Zygmunt Klukowski: \\"The Jewish laborers are sent to Bortatycze and Bialobrzeg outside of Zamosc. The work consists of digging ditches in order to drain the swamps there. They must work standing in the water. They sleep in barracks that are incredibly dirty. They must make this trip (to the labor camp) every day, and if they make the slightest mistake, they are beaten with clubs. The Jewish slave laborers are covered with lice. They are mostly boys, 17-20 years old.\\" On November 10, 1942, Dr. Klukowski writes: \\"In principle, all the Jews in the settlements of the Bilgoraj district, to which Szczebreszyn belongs, have been killed. The only ones remaining are those in the forests, valleys, etc.\\" In total, there were six separate transports from Szczebrzeszyn to Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp between May and November of 1942 -- totaling more than 5,500 Jewish men, women and children to their immediate deaths. Hundreds of other Jews were murdered in Szczebrzeszyn, hunted down by police and Polish civilians and then murdered. One Polish couple did shelter a Jewish family and were named Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem after the war. The once vibrant Jewish community of Szczebrzeszyn ceased to exist. = After the Zamo≈õƒá Uprising = > In July the Polish resistance carried out the country-wide Operation > Tempest, and in the Zamo≈õƒá region the town of Szczebrzeszyn and Zamo≈õƒá > itself were freed by the partisans. Battle of Osuchy  In literature  The name Szczebrzeszyn is infamous for being very difficult to pronounce for non-native speakers. Polish poet, Jan Brzechwa used the town's name in his poem entitled ChrzƒÖszcz. The line with Szczebrzeszyn goes like this: W Szczebrzeszynie chrzƒÖszcz brzmi w trzcinie (pronunciation) This roughly translates to: \\"In [the town of] Szczebrzeszyn a beetle sounds in the reed\\". The phrase has been incorporated in everyday language as an epitome of Polish tongue twisters, and is often presented by natives to foreign learners of Polish. A monument depicting a cricket playing the violin that was erected in Szczebrzeszyn refers to the poem. In 2004 Philip Bibel (1909‚Äì2006), brother of painter Leon Bibel, published his Tales of the Shtetl, a memoir of early 20th century life in the shtetl of Szczebrzeszyn.

Early history Gibbs was born on 22 November 1902 in England, the third son of The Hon. Herbert Gibbs, later created, in 1923, The 1st Baron Hunsdon of Hunsdon. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He moved to Southern Rhodesia in 1928, buying a farm at Nyamandhlovu, near Bulawayo.Gibbs ready to quit in Rhodesia, The Glasgow Herald, 23 June 1969 He became active in farming administration and helped found the National Farmers Union. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the general election of 1948 as a United Party member, representing the constituency of Wankie, serving one term before standing down in 1954.Review: Humphrey Gibbs, Beleaguered Governor: Southern Rhodesia, 1929-69 by Alan Megahey, Michael Carver, The International History Review, Vol. 21, No. 3 (Sep., 1999), pp. 791-793 As Governor of Southern Rhodesia In 1959, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Gibbs as Governor of Southern Rhodesia and appointed him a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1960. The Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) by the Rhodesian Front government (under Prime Minister Ian Smith) in November 1965 placed Gibbs in a very difficult position. He was intensely loyal to Rhodesia, and was a close friend of Ian Smith, but he was also equally loyal to his office as the Queen's viceroy. While understanding what had made Smith's government declare the UDI, Gibbs decided that final legality rested with the Crown, not Smith and his government. By the time Smith and Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont called on Governor Gibbs after the UDI was signed, Whitehall had directed Gibbs to use his reserve power to dismiss Smith and his entire cabinet from office. Gibbs complied with the order without hesitation. He declared that by issuing the UDI, Smith and his government had committed an act of treason. However, Smith and his ministers simply ignored the dismissal, advising Gibbs that \\"in view of the new [Rhodesian] constitution‚Ä¶, he no longer has any executive powers in Rhodesia\\"‚Äîand therefore, his power to sack them no longer existed.Bulletin, Volumes 3-4, Africa Institute of South Africa, 1965, pages 12-13Rhodesian independence, (Interim history), Robert W. Peterson, Facts on File, 1971, page 34 Under siege Official Flag of Rhodesia during Gibbs's term as Governor Several high-ranking officers of the Rhodesian military went to Governor Gibbs earlier in the day, made a statement of loyalty to him, and asked Gibbs to issue a warrant so that they could arrest Smith and Dupont. However, Gibbs knew that the bulk of the officer corps, as well as the rank and file of the Rhodesian military, were solidly behind Smith's government and that such a move would lead to a coup d'√©tat. Gibbs announced that despite the UDI, he had no intention of resigning his office or leaving Rhodesia, and that therefore, he would remain in Government House in Salisbury as the sole legal representative of Queen Elizabeth II.Ian Smith Strips Gibbs Of All Official Privilege, Associated Press, The Morning Record, 18 November 1965 With few exceptions, the international community continued to recognise him as the Queen's sole legitimate representative in the area‚Äîand thus, the only lawful authority in what London maintained was still the colony of Southern Rhodesia.Rhodesian Government Hangs Two More Despite Protests, Associated Press, Gadsden Times, 11 March 1968 In response, Smith declared that Government House was only \\"temporarily occupied\\" by Gibbs \\"in a personal capacity\\", and would be occupied by Dupont once it became available. This action led to four years of harassment and petty afflictions by the Rhodesian government, resulting in making Gibbs and his wife virtually prisoners in Government House, by cutting off his telephone, electricity and water.Sir Humphrey Gibbs; Britain's Last Governor of Rhodesia, Los Angeles Times, 11 November 1990 It also took away his ceremonial guard and official cars, and sent him bills for the rent of Government House, which he refused to pay. However, his supporters set up a Governor's Fund to pay for the upkeep of the building, and with the assistance of a small staff, led by Sir John Pestell, he managed to remain defiant.Sir John Pestell, Daily Telegraph, 22 August 2005 While Gibbs continued to occupy Government House, Dupont and his wife held official receptions at Governor's Lodge in the Salisbury suburb of Highlands.East Africa and Rhodesia, Volume 42, Africana, 1965, pages 339, 464 This had previously been used by Gibbs when Southern Rhodesia was part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.Year Book and Guide of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland, with Biographies, Rhodesian Publications, Limited, 1962, page 33 During this time, Government House had been the residence of the Governor- General of the Federation.Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Newsletter, Issues 27-52,, 1960, page 428 In 1967, on the second anniversary of UDI, Gibbs declared that his visitors' book would be open to all those who wished to show their loyalty to The Queen, while Dupont, in response, announced that the visitors' book at his office, on the same street, would be open to all those who wished to show their support for UDI.Power and Pragmatism: The memoirs of Malcolm Rifkind, Malcolm Rifkind, Biteback Publishing, 2016 In June 1969, Gibbs resigned after Smith's government held and won a referendum that year making Rhodesia a republic.Queen's man resigns, The Age, 26 June 1969 He remained in Rhodesia and lived the rest of his life on his farm between 1970 and 1983, and latterly in Harare (as Salisbury was renamed in 1982) from 1983 until his death in 1990.

It is a 52-episode series produced by Telecom Animation Film and Madhouse. Story The story is set in the 22nd century where space travel, planet colonization and anti-gravity basketball are practically everyday things. Planet Earth has become uninhabitable, and therefore people live in colonies on the surrounding planets. On a school field trip, a mistake causes the protagonist, a young transfer student named Luna, her pet robot, and six of her classmates to be thrown through a gravity storm and crash land on a seemingly uninhabited planet. There, with Luna as their leader, the robot cat Chako, the lone wolf Kaoru, the spoiled rich boy Howard, the shy Sharla, the obedient Bell, the prideful musician Menori and the young genius Shingo must fight for their survival. But is the planet really uninhabited, or is there someone or something out there, waiting in the shadows? Characters =Main Characters= ; : :Luna grew up with her father on Mars. Her father died saving her in an accident when she was eight, and her mother died two years before that. After her father died, she won a scholarship from the Howard Foundation, and moved to Colony Loca-A2 along with her pet robot cat Chako. She almost always seems to be happy, but sometimes is overwhelmed by memories of her father's death. She carries with her a backpack that was once her father's that is very precious to her. She doesn't like to see anyone hurt, and will go out of her way to help someone. She is a natural leader and always seems to bring out the good in everyone. Although her plans all have good intentions, sometimes they don't turn out the way she wants them to. Luna has powers that nobody else has and her powers can be considered telepathic. Luna can speak to Adam telepathically. Luna looks after and takes very good care of all her friends. She is 14 years old. At the end of the series, she eventually works towards terraforming Earth. ; : :Chako is a robotic cat that was abandoned by her old owner and left for scrap. She was about to be thrown into a smelter when Luna's dad rescued her and rebuilt her to give to Luna as a present. At first, Luna hated Chako, but later found out that she and Chako had a lot in common, and gradually warmed up to her. Chako originally got onto the field trip space ship by sneaking her way aboard. She helps Shingo out with most of the electronic and technical problems. Though a robot, Chako breaks down the sugar in food and uses it for energy, and thus also needs to eat (fruit, in particular). Chako has a sensor which can be used to analyse things they find, diagnose medical problems, etc. She can also determine whether or not food is edible. She has extendable claws, though these are just for show and not practical weapons. ; : :Kaoru is the lone wolf of the group, relatively quiet and reserved, preferring to only speak when needed. He regularly goes off on his own, despite the wishes of the other children. He is the only one who has nothing with him when they crash land on the planet. He risks his life for another without hesitation because like Luna, he holds a death deep in his heart that has changed his life. He's resourceful and catches onto something before anyone else. Kaoru is often the most reliable out of the group. He was the only one - besides Luna - who stood up to Howard at the beginning. As the series progresses, it is strongly implied by his reactions in episode 40 that he has developed some romantic feelings toward Luna, as she is the one he best communicates with. He is 14 years old. At the end of the series, he eventually becomes the pilot of a Mars shuttle. ; : :A shy bookworm who Luna becomes friends with when she transfers into the school. Over time spent in the Island, Sharla grows stronger, braver, and more confident in herself. When they initially crash, Sharla has her pouch, handkerchief, hand soap, and some candy with her. Sharla names many of the creatures and places they encounter throughout the series, such as the Tobihane, Pague, Fairy Lake, and . She gets the nickname from Chako and Howard, which she doesn't seem to like. It is lightly implied that Sharla has developed feelings for Bell as the series goes on. She is 14 years old. At the end of the series, she eventually becomes a writer, and documents the story of their adventures. ; :Voiced by: Mabuki Andou, Kiyomi Asai (younger child, in flashbacks) :Class president of the school where Luna transfers. She may sometimes sound cold and insensitive, but inside she's a very good person who wants the best for everyone. She plays the violin, and the violin that she brings with her to the planet is very precious to her. She also has a handkerchief with her when they initially crash. Upon arriving at the island, she declares herself leader, though the group later elects Luna to be their leader. Even so, when Luna is not present, Menori often takes on leadership responsibilities. When Menori was little her mother died and her father taught her not to show her emotions to anyone. She is 14 years old. At the end of the series, she works as her father's secretary, and eventually aims to be a parliament member and to open trade with the planet they crashed on. ; : :Son of a wealthy company owner. He is a loud, spoiled, cowardly and selfish boy who appears to have no love for his mother. He is the comic relief of the group being that he is always making mistakes with comical results. While not primarily an antagonist in the series, his selfish antics are often the cause of many of the misfortunes that befall the group. Throughout the series he matures. He has a hand mirror and a comb with him when they crash land on the planet. He is 14 years old. At the end of the series, he eventually becomes an actor. ; : :Bell is an especially kind and physically strong character, but he lacks confidence. Because of this, he is pressured into doing whatever Howard asks, as Bell's father works for Howard's father, and Howard often threatens to have his father fire Bell's father. Bell is originally from the colonies on the planet Pluto. Because his father has worked in colony pioneering, he has some knowledge of how to survive off the land, though not any real experience. When they initially crash land, Bell has a fanny pack with him. As the series progresses, he stands up to Howard and grows into a more confident person. He develops feelings for Luna, and eventually makes what Chako calls a \\"proposal\\" to her (shown in episode 40), to which she has a mixed response. He is 16 years old, and the oldest of the children. At the end of the series, he eventually gets a job developing a settlement on the planet Albion. ; : :Shingo is the genius of the group. He skipped two grades due to his high grades, and is a mechanical genius. Though he is mature in intelligence, he is still the baby of the group, and develops the worst homesickness. He has a screwdriver set and an exacto knife with him when they crash land on the planet. He is 12 years old, and initially the youngest member of the party. At the end of the series, he eventually follows in Porte's footsteps, aiming to be a mechanic. ; : :When the group stumbled upon some strange ruins, they found a strange young alien boy in a cryogenic sleep. Upon his awakening, Luna found the boy's name was Alduram Gyet and that she was to take care of him. It wasn't until Howard blurted out the name Adam, that he was given the nickname. He can speak to Luna telepathically because of his and Luna's powers. Adam is frequently conflicted about whether he wants to return to the colonies with the other children, or to remain on the planet where he was found. He especially loves the Pague creatures. =Secondary Characters= *Porte (Masaaki Tsukada) ‚Äì Old enough to be the grandfather of the main cast, he is the mechanic of the space transport \\"Orion\\". He takes a particular liking to Shingo, as they are both mechanically inclined. *Luna's father (Kenji Hamada) - He was the one who found Chako, fixed her, and gave her to Luna. He dies on Mars trying to save Luna. *' (Makoto Ishii) - Kaoru's rival who got sucked out into space when he and Kaoru had an accident while flying through an asteroid storm. *Farlow (Yasuyuki Kase) - Porte's son who was believed to have died while on board a resettlement ship that crashed on a satellite. Porte however still holds faith that he is still alive somewhere. Escapees *Brindo (Junpei Morita) - He is an escaped prisoner who highjacked The Orion and crashed to the same island as Luna and the crew. He seems to be the leader and is the most insightful of the three. *Zilba (Kyoko Hikami) - The only female prisoner of the other two that escaped on The Orion. She seems to enjoy the Island. She has an electric whip and a poison needle gun that she carries around with her. *Bob (Mitsuaki Hoshino) - Like Brindo and Zilba he is also an escaped prisoner. He is a cyborg and more muscle-headed than the other two. Native Machines and Animals *Tako (Naoki Bandou) - A robot they meet within the mainland. He holds the key to Adam's past. *Survive (Tamio ≈åki) - An artificial intelligence managing the climate of the entire planet on which the children crash land. Survive is the main antagonist of the series. *Pague - A strange elephantine creature with a long tongue which the group befriends. It appears to be a child of its species. Compared to many of the other creatures on the island that the children crash land on, he is generally more gentle and patient. At times he aids the group with his large size and strength, and the children reward him by feeding him the leaves that he uses for food (particularly those that he cannot reach). The name Pague is used both for the specific creature that the group first encounters, as well as for the species of creatures in general (i.e., \\"a herd of pague\\"). The name was thought up by character Sharla.

It was started by Miguel de Icaza in 1994 as a clone of the then-popular Norton Commander. GNU Midnight Commander is part of the GNU project and is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.https://www.gnu.org/software/mc Design Midnight Commander is a console application with a text user interface. The main interface consists of two panels which display the file system. File selection is done using arrow keys, the insert key is used to select files and the function keys perform operations such as renaming, editing and copying files. Later versions of the Midnight Commander additionally have mouse support. Such versions are aware of GPM and X terminal emulators (such as GNOME Terminal or xterm) which support mouse reporting. When running inside an X terminal, these versions can update the name of the window in which Midnight Commander runs (if allowed by the terminal emulator). Midnight Commander's features include the ability to view the contents of RPM package files, to work with common archive formats as if they were simply another directory, and to function as an FTP or FISH client. Midnight Commander also includes an editor called mcedit, which can be executed as a standalone program or from Midnight Commander using the F4 key. mcedit's features include syntax highlighting for many languages, macros, code snippets, simple integration with external tools, automatic indentation, mouse support, a clipboard and the ability to work in both ASCII and hex modes. Users also have the option to replace mcedit with the editor of their choice (Options Menu>Configuration>[Don't] Use Internal Edit). Midnight Commander can also rename groups of files, unlike a number of other file managers that can only rename one file at a time. This is convenient for manipulating large collections of files, e.g. to make them conform to a new naming convention. Midnight Commander can also move files to a different directory at the same time as it renames them. It lets the user specify the original and resulting file names using wildcard characters. This makes the power of regular expressions available for renaming files, with a convenient user interface. In addition, the user can select whether or not to use \\"shell patterns\\" or \\"globs\\" (automatic grouping of wildcards). All of these features are available by using the File > Rename/Move menu selection. (Pressing F1 would then produce a brief explanation of the options, including examples of how to use wildcards.) Midnight Commander is based on versatile text interfaces, such as Ncurses or S-Lang, which allow it to work on a regular console, inside an X terminal, over SSH connections, over an RS-232 interface (for embedded devices) and all kinds of remote shells. Unicode support Native support for UTF-8 locales for Unicode was added in 2009 to development versions of Midnight Commander.

Far Manager uses the Win32 console and has a keyboard-oriented user interface (although limited mouse operation, including drag-and-drop, is possible). Far Manager was created by Eugene Roshal, and has been under development by the Far Group since 2000. The project's Unicode branches (2.0 and 3.0) are open-source (under the revised BSD license). All branches are available as 32- and 64-bit builds. Far Manager is often viewed as a very customizable file manager and text editor, and a free alternative to Total Commander. Features Far Manager features an internal viewer and editor, customizable user menus, tree views, file search, compare, integrated help, and a task switcher for its tools. Its standard functionality can be expanded with macros (which allow scripting) and plugins. Far Manager's default interface combines two file panels with a command prompt. Panels may be fully customized as to which columns are shown and in which order, and operations may be done to and from either panel. The file panels support wildcard selection, advanced filtering, sorting and highlighting. The file panels and the command prompt are both active at the same time (they are interacted with using different keys), and most features can be accessed using keyboard shortcuts (the key bar at the bottom displays the function key actions for the currently held down modifier keys). Extensibility Far's standard functionality can be greatly extended with macros (written in Lua scripting language, primarily used to record keypress sequences) and plugins. Standard plugins installed by default include FTP, Windows network, extensible archive file support and temporary panel (sandbox) virtual file systems, a process list, print manager, filename case converter, and several editor plugins to format, wrap, and otherwise alter text. Third-party plugins are available from the PlugRing repository and plugin announcement forum (in Russian). Some popular plugins include regular expression search and replace (both in the text editor and across multiple files), syntax highlighting and auto-completion for the text editor, SFTP/SCP and Windows Registry virtual file systems, 7-zip integration, a hex editor and a picture viewer (which overlays a DirectX surface over Far's console window). Wrappers are available which allow using some Total Commander plugins with Far Manager, and vice versa. Plugins can be developed using the native C/Pascal API,FAR Encyclopedia for Developers or using wrappers which permit plugin development in other platforms and languages, such as .NET (including PowerShell),FarNet and PowerShellFar on Google Code. and Lua.LuaFar thread (in Russian).  Linux and MacOS version  far2l project develops Linux and MacOS ports of Far Manager. As for now, port successfully builds and most common functions work as expected. Among ported and working plugins there are FarFTP, Colorer, MultiArc, TmpPanel. Licensing Far Manager is available under the revised BSD license. Originally, Far Manager was available as 40 days shareware for everyone except for citizens of the former USSR countries, who could use it as freeware for non-commercial use only.License.xUSSR.txt (Far EULA for ex-USSR countries citizens). Distributed with older 1.x versions. On 26 October 2007, the source code for the Unicode development version (1.80, later renamed to 2.0) was released under the revised BSD license. On 17 May 2010 the 1.x branch has also been released under the revised BSD license, though without source code.

Its main purpose is to reduce friction between strands of hair to allow smoother brushing or combing, which might otherwise cause damage to the scalp. Various other benefits are often advertised, such as hair repair, strengthening, or a reduction in split ends. Conditioners are available in a wide range of forms including viscous liquids, gels and creams as well as thinner lotions and sprays. Hair conditioner is usually used after the hair has been washed with shampoo. It is applied and worked into the hair and may either be washed out a short time later or left in. History For centuries, natural oils have been used to condition human hair. A conditioner popular with men in the late Victorian era was Macassar oil, but this product was quite greasy and required pinning a small cloth, known as an antimacassar, to chairs and sofas to keep the upholstery from being damaged by the oil. A bottle of modern day hair conditioner by Clairol (right). Modern hair conditioner was created at the turn of the 20th century when perfumer √âdouard Pinaud presented a product he called Brilliantine at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. His product was intended to soften men's hair, including beards and moustaches. Since the invention of Pinaud's early products, modern science has advanced the hair conditioner industry to include those made with silicone, fatty alcohols, and quaternary ammonium compounds. These chemical products have the benefits of hair conditioner without feeling greasy or heavy. Mechanism of action The outermost layer of a hair follicle is called the cuticle and is composed largely of keratin. This is rich in cysteine groups which are mildly acidic. When the hair is washed these groups can deprotonate, giving the hair a negative charge. The ingredients in conditioner, especially positively charged quaternary ammonium species, such as Behentrimonium Chloride or polymers that are known as Polyquaternium-XX, where XX is an arbitrary number, can then become attached to the hair via electrostatic interactions. Once attached these compounds have several effects. Their long hydrocarbon backbone helps to lubricate the surface of each hair follicle, reducing the sensation of roughness and assisting combing. The surface coating of cationic groups means that hairs are repelled from each other electrostatically, which reduces clumping. The compounds can also act as antistatic agents, which helps to reduce frizzing. Types * Pack conditioners are heavy and thick, with a high content of cationic surfactants that are able to bind to the hair structure and \\"glue\\" the hair surface scales together. These are usually applied to the hair for a longer time. The surfactants are based on long, straight aliphatic fatty acid chains similar to saturated fatty acids. Their molecules have a tendency to crystallize easily to form a lamellar structure, giving the conditioner higher viscosity, and they tend to form thicker layers on the hair surface. * Leave-in conditioners are thinner and have different surfactants, which add only a little material to the hair to avoid weighing down the hair or causing greasiness. They are based on unsaturated fatty acid chains, which are bent, not straight. This shape makes them less prone to crystallizing, making a lighter, less viscous mixture and providing a significantly thinner layer on the hair. The difference between pack and leave-in conditioners is similar to the difference between fats and oils, the latter being less viscous. Leave-in conditioner is designed to be used in a similar way to hair oil, preventing the tangling of hair and keeping it smooth. Its use is particularly prevalent by those with naturally curly or kinky hair. * Ordinary conditioners combine some aspects of pack and leave-in conditioners. Ordinary conditioners are generally applied directly after using shampoo, and manufacturers usually produce a conditioner counterpart for different types of shampoo for this purpose. * Hold conditioners, based on cationic polyelectrolyte polymers, hold the hair in a desired shape. These have a function and composition similar to diluted hair gels. * Cleansing conditioners are a newer category, typically based on a combination of amphoteric and cationic surfactants that can be used in place of a shampoo either as a pre-treatment before shampooing for hair that is damaged or very curly. https://fashionmagazine.com/face-body/what-are- cleansing-conditioners/ Ingredients There are several types of hair conditioner ingredients, differing in composition and functionality: * Acidifiers, acidity regulators which maintain the conditioner's pH at about 3.5. In contact with acidic environment, the hair's somewhat scaly surface tightens up, as the hydrogen bonds between the keratin molecules are strengthened. * Antistatic agents which bind to the hair and reduce the static, these can include cationic polymers such as Polyquaternium-10 and Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride * Detanglers, which modify the hair surface pH as acidifiers, or by coating it with polymers, as glossers. * Glossers, light- reflecting chemicals which bind to the hair surface. Usually polymers, usually silicones, e.g., Dimethicone or Cyclopentasiloxane. * Lubricants, such as fatty alcohols, Panthenol, Dimethicone, etc. * Moisturizers, whose role is to hold moisture in the hair. Usually, these contain high proportions of humectants. These could also be provided by natural oils such as Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil. * Oils (EFAs ‚Äì essential fatty acids), which can help dry/porous hair become more soft and pliable. The scalp produces a natural oil called sebum. EFAs are the closest thing to natural sebum (sebum contains EFAs). * Preservatives that protect the product from spoilage by microorganisms during the product shelf life. * Reconstructors, usually containing hydrolyzed protein. Their role is supposedly to penetrate the hair and strengthen its structure through polymer crosslinking. * Sequestrants, for better function in hard water. * Sunscreen, for protection against protein degradation and color loss. Currently Benzophenone-4 and Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate are the two sunscreens most commonly used in hair products. Cinnamidopyltrimonium Chloride and a few others are used to a much lesser degree. The common sunscreens used on skin are rarely used for hair products due to their texture and weight effects. * Surfactants ‚Äì approximately 97% of hair consists of a protein called keratin. The surface of keratin contains negatively charged amino acids. Hair conditioners therefore usually contain cationic surfactants, which don't wash out completely, because their hydrophilic ends strongly bind to keratin. The hydrophobic ends of the surfactant molecules then act as the new hair surface.. Examples are Behentrimonium Chloride and Cetrimonium Chloride * Thermal protectors, usually heat-absorbing polymers, shielding the hair against excessive heat, caused by, e.g., blow-drying, curling irons or hot rollers. =pH= Conditioners are frequently acidic, as low pH protonates the keratin's amino acids. The hydrogen ions give the hair a positive charge and create more hydrogen bonds among the keratin scales, giving the hair a more compact structure. Organic acids such as citric acid are usually used to maintain acidity.

Gene doping is the hypothetical non-therapeutic use of gene therapy by athletes in order to improve their performance in those sporting events which prohibit such applications of genetic modification technology,World Anti-Doping Agency The World Anti-Doping Code: The 2008 Prohibited List of International Standards pages 7-8 and for reasons other than the treatment of disease. , there is no evidence that gene doping has been used for athletic performance-enhancement in any sporting events. Gene doping would involve the use of gene transfer to increase or decrease gene expression and protein biosynthesis of a specific human protein; this could be done by directly injecting the gene carrier into the person, or by taking cells from the person, transfecting the cells, and administering the cells back to the person. The historical development of interest in gene doping by athletes and concern about the risks of gene doping and how to detect it moved in parallel with the development of the field of gene therapy, especially with the publication in 1998 of work on a transgenic mouse overexpressing insulin- like growth factor 1 that was much stronger than normal mice, even in old age, preclinical studies published in 2002 of a way to deliver erythropoietin (EPO) via gene therapy, and publication in 2004 of the creation of a \\"marathon mouse\\" with much greater endurance than normal mice, created by delivering the gene expressing PPAR gamma to the mice. The scientists generating these publications were all contacted directly by athletes and coaches seeking access to the technology. The public became aware of that activity in 2006 when such efforts were part of the evidence presented in the trial of a German coach. Scientists themselves, as well as bodies including the World Anti- Doping Agency (WADA), the International Olympic Committee, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, started discussing the risk of gene doping in 2001, and by 2003 WADA had added gene doping to the list of banned doping practices, and shortly thereafter began funding research on methods to detect gene doping. Genetic enhancement includes manipulation of genes or gene transfer by healthy athletes for the purpose of physically improving their performance. Genetic enhancement includes gene doping and has potential for abuse among athletes, all while opening the door to political and ethical controversy.Wells DJ. 2008. \\"Gene doping: the hype and the reality\\". Br. J. Pharmacol. [Internet] 154:623‚Äì31. History The history of concern about the potential for gene doping follows the history of gene therapy, the medical use of genes to treat diseases, which was first clinically tested in the 1990s. Interest by the athletic community was especially spurred by the creation in a university lab of a \\"mighty mouse\\", created by administering a virus carrying the gene expressing insulin-like growth factor 1 to mice; the mice were stronger and remained strong even as they aged, without exercise. The lab had been seeking treatments for muscle wasting diseases, but when their work was made public, the lab was inundated with calls from athletes seeking the treatment, with one coach offering his whole team.Gretchen Reynolds for The New York Times. June 3, 2007. Outlaw DNA The scientist told The New York Times in 2007: \\"I was quite surprised, I must admit. People would try to entice me, saying things like, 'It'll help advance your research.' Some offered to pay me.\\" He also told the Times that every time similar research is published he gets calls and that he explains that, even should the treatment became ready for use in people, which would take years, there would be serious risks, including death; he also said that even after he explains this, the athletes still want it. In 1999, the field of gene therapy was set back when Jesse Gelsinger died in a gene therapy clinical trial, suffering a massive inflammatory reaction to the drug. This led regulatory authorities in the US and Europe to increase safety requirements in clinical trials even beyond the initial restrictions that had been put in place at the beginning of the biotechnology era to deal with the risks of recombinant DNA. In June 2001, Theodore Friedmann, one of the pioneers of gene therapy, and Johann Olav Koss an Olympic gold medallist in speed skating, published a paper that was the first public warning about gene doping. Also in June 2001, a Gene Therapy Working Group, convened by the Medical Commission of the International Olympic Committee noted that \\"we are aware that there is the potential for abuse of gene therapy medicines and we shall begin to establish procedures and state-of-the-art testing methods for identifying athletes who might misuse such technology\\". Research was published in 2002 about a preclinical gene therapy called Repoxygen, which delivered the gene encoding erythropoietin (EPO) as a potential treatment for anemia. The scientists from that company also received calls from athletes and coaches. In that same year the World Anti-Doping Agency held its first meeting to discuss the risk of gene doping, and the US President's Council on Bioethics discussed gene doping in the context of human enhancement at several sessions.President's Council on Bioethics April 25-26, 2002 Agenda, [https://bioethicsarchive.georgetown.edu/pcbe/background/workpaper7.html Working Paper 7President's Council on Bioethics July 11-12, 2002 Meeting Agenda Session 4President's Council on Bioethics September 12-13, 2002 Meeting Agenda Session 7: Enhancement 5: Genetic Enhancement of Muscle, H. Lee Sweeney, Ph.D., Professor and Chairman of Physiology, University of Pennsylvania In 2003, the field of gene therapy took a step forward and a step back; first gene therapy drug was approved, Gendicine, which was approved in China for the treatment of certain cancers, but children in France who had seemingly been effective treated with gene therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency (non-human) began developing leukemia. In 2003 the BALCO scandal became public, in which chemists, trainers and athletes conspired to evade doping controls with new and undetectable doping substances. In 2003 the World Doping Agency proactively added gene doping to the list of banned doping practices. Also in 2003, a symposium convened by the American Association for the Advancement of Science focused on the issue.UCSD Public Relations: February 18, 2003 News Release: Bigger, Faster, Stronger: Genetic Enhancement and Athletics Research published in 2004 showing that mice given gene therapy coding for a protein called PPAR gamma had about double the endurance of untreated mice and were dubbed \\"marathon mice\\"; those scientists received calls from athletes and coaches. Also in 2004 the World Anti-Doping Agency began to fund research to detect gene doping, and formed a permanent expert panel to advise it on risks and to guide the funding. In 2006 interest from athletes in gene doping received widespread media coverage due its mention during the trial of a German coach who was accused and found guilty of giving his athletes performance enhancing drugs without their knowledge; an email in which the coach attempted to obtain Repoxygen was read in open court by a prosecutor. This was the first public disclosure that athletes were interested in gene doping. In 2011 the second gene therapy drug was approved; Neovasculgen, which delivers the gene encoding VEGF, was approved in Russia to treat peripheral artery disease.AdisInsight Vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy - HSCI Page accessed June 5, 2016 In 2012 Glybera, a treatment for a rare inherited disorder, became the first treatment to be approved for clinical use in either Europe or the United States.Gallagher, James. (2 November 2012) BBC News ‚Äì Gene therapy: Glybera approved by European Commission. BBC. Retrieved 15 December 2012. As the field of gene therapy has developed, the risk of gene doping becoming a reality has increased with it.  Agents  There are numerous genes of interest as agents for gene doping. They include erythropoietin, insulin-like growth factor 1, human growth hormone, myostatin, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, endorphin, enkephalin and alpha-actinin-3. The risks of gene doping would be similar to those of gene therapy: immune reaction to the native protein leading to the equivalent of a genetic disease, massive inflammatory response, cancer, and death, and in all cases, these risks would be undertaken for short-term gain as opposed to treating a serious disease. =Alpha- actinin-3= Alpha-actinin-3 is found only in skeletal muscle in humans, and has been identified in several genetic studies as having a different polymorphism in world-class athletes compared with normal people. One form that causes the gene to make more protein is found in sprinters and is related to increased power; another form that causes the gene to make less protein is found in endurance athletes. Gene doping agents could be designed with either polymorphism, or for endurance athletes, some DNA construct that interfered with expression like a small interfering RNA. = Myostatin = Myostatin is a protein responsible for inhibiting muscle differentiation and growth. Removing the myostatin gene or otherwise limiting its expression leads to an increase in muscle size and power. This has been demonstrated in knockout mice lacking the gene that were dubbed \\"Schwarzenegger mice\\". Humans born with defective genes can also serve as \\"knockout models\\"; a German boy with a mutation in both copies of the myostatin gene was born with well-developed muscles. The advanced muscle growth continued after birth, and the boy could lift weights of 3 kg at the age of 4. In work published in 2009, scientists administered follistatin via gene therapy to the quadriceps of non-human primates, resulting in local muscle growth similar to the mice. = Erythropoietin (EPO) = Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that acts as a hormone, controlling red blood cell production. Athletes have injected the EPO protein as a performance-enhancing substance for many years (blood doping). When the additional EPO increases the production of red blood cells in circulation, this increases the amount of oxygen available to muscle, enhancing an athlete's endurance. Recent studies suggest it may be possible to introduce another EPO gene into an animal in order to increase EPO production endogenously. EPO genes have been successfully inserted into mice and monkeys, and were found to increase hematocrits by as much as 80 percent in those animals. However, the endogenous and transgene derived EPO elicited autoimmune responses in some animals in the form of severe anemia. = Insulin-like growth factor 1 = Insulin-like growth factor 1 is a protein involved in the mediation of the growth hormone. Administration of IGF-1 to mice has resulted in more muscle growth and quicker muscle and nerve regeneration. If athletes were to use this the sustained production of IGF-1 could cause heart disease and cancer. =Others= Modulating the levels of proteins that affect psychology are also potential goals for gene doping; for example pain perception depends on endorphins and enkephalins, response to stress depends on BDNF, and an increase in synthesis of monamines could improve the mood of athletes. Preproenkephalin has been administered via gene therapy using a replication-deficient herpes simplex virus, which targets nerves, to mice with results good enough to justify a Phase I clinical trial in people with terminal cancer with uncontrolled pain. Adopting that approach for athletes would be problematic since the pain deadening would likely be permanent. VEGF has been tested in clinical trials to increase blood flow and has been considered as a potential gene doping agent; however long term follow up of the clinical trial subjects showed poor results. The same is true of fibroblast growth factor. Glucagon-like peptide-1 increases the amount of glucose in the liver and has been administered via gene therapy to the livers of mouse models of diabetes and was shown to increase gluconeogenesis' for athletes this would make more energy available and reduce the buildup of lactic acid.  Detection  The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is the main regulatory organization looking into the issue of the detection of gene doping.World Anti Doping Agency. Gene Doping Page archived January 7, 2016 Both direct and indirect testing methods are being researched by the organization. Directly detecting the use of gene therapy usually requires the discovery of recombinant proteins or gene insertion vectors, while most indirect methods involve examining the athlete in an attempt to detect bodily changes or structural differences between endogenous and recombinant proteins. Indirect methods are by nature more subjective, as it becomes very difficult to determine which anomalies are proof of gene doping, and which are simply natural, though unusual, biological properties. For example, Eero M√§ntyranta, an Olympic cross country skier, had a mutation which made his body produce abnormally high amounts of red blood cells. It would be very difficult to determine whether or not M√§ntyranta's red blood cell levels were due to an innate genetic advantage, or an artificial one. Research A 2016 review found that about 120 DNA polymorphisms had been identified in the literature related to some aspect of athletic performance, 77 related to endurance and 43 related to power. 11 had been replicated in three or more studies and six were identified in genome-wide association studies, but 29 had not been replicated in at least one study. The 11 replicated markers were: ;Endurance: * ACE Alu I/D (rs4646994) (Called ACE I) * ACTN3 577X * PPARA rs4253778 G, * PPARGC1A Gly482; ; power/strength markers: * ACE Alu I/D (rs4646994) (called ACE D) * ACTN3 Arg577 * AMPD1 Gln12 * HIF1A 582Ser * MTHFR rs1801131 C * NOS3 rs2070744 T * PPARG 12Ala The six GWAS markers were: * CREM rs1531550 A, * DMD rs939787 T * GALNT13 rs10196189 G * NFIA-AS1 rs1572312 C, * RBFOX1 rs7191721 G * TSHR rs7144481 C  Ethics  The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) determined that any non-therapeutic form of genetic manipulation for enhancement of athletic performance is banned under its code. There are guidelines to determine if said technology should be prohibited in sport: if two of the three conditions are met, then the technology is prohibited in sport (harmful to one's health, performance enhancing, and/or against the \\"spirit of sport\\"). The high risks associated with gene therapy can be outweighed by the potential save the lives of individuals with diseases: according to Alain Fischer, who was involved in clinical trials of gene therapy in children with severe combined immunodeficiency, \\"Only people who are dying would have reasonable grounds for using it. Using gene therapy for doping is ethically unacceptable and scientifically stupid.\\" As seen with past cases, including the steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), athletes may choose to incorporate risky genetic technologies into their training regimes. The mainstream perspective is that gene doping is dangerous and unethical, as is any application of a therapeutic intervention for non-therapeutic or enhancing purposes, and that it compromises the ethical foundation of medicine and the spirit of sport. Others, who support human enhancement on broader grounds, or who see a false dichotomy between \\"natural\\" and \\"artificial\\" or a denial of the role of technology in improving athletic performance, do not oppose or support gene doping.

Arrested in Pakistan on 13 July 2004, files found on his laptop contained details of a terrorist plot to attack U.S. financial buildings and locations in the UK, including Heathrow airport. Khan's arrest was attributed to leads arising from the arrest of Musaad Aruchi a month earlier.Suspect arrested in Pakistan may hold al-Qaeda's secrets, The Guardian, 8 August 2004 Following his arrest, Khan agreed to cooperate with investigators, and continued to communicate with Al-Qaeda as part of a sting operation. Following the publication of Khan's name, British authorities moved quickly to arrest 13 members of the British terrorist cell with which Khan had been communicating (the so-called Luton cell). Evidence gathering may not have yet been completed and other plotters may have escaped due to the need to make the arrests quickly. On 14 July 2005, ABC News revealed that Mohammad Sidique Khan, one of the suspected perpetrators of the 7 July London bombings, had been in contact with members of the Luton cell that was broken up. Khan is an alumnus of NED University and Adamjee Science College in Karachi.

Sean McCormack, a National Security Council spokesman, stated \\"She was in the middle of making a point and [Blitzer] interrupted her, and she reflexively repeated 'on background,' but she was not confirming it and went on to complete her thought.\\" Leak of Qaeda suspect name criticized, The Boston Globe, 10 August 2004 Precisely who leaked Khan's name, and why, was controversial.

Following the publication of Khan's name, British authorities moved quickly to arrest 13 members of the British terrorist cell with which Khan had been communicating (the so-called Luton cell). By the evening of 9 August, two of the suspects had been released from custody, and the interviews of two others had been called off. An additional five suspects were reported as having escaped the British raids. Some of those who still maintained that the Bush administration had leaked Khan's name went on to link the incident to the leak of Valerie Plame's name as denoting a pattern of compromising intelligence operatives for political gain.

Biography. Virtual Library of Polish Literature, University of Gdansk. . Jasie≈Ñski was also a communist activist in Poland, France and the Soviet Union, where he was executed during the Great Purge. He is acclaimed by members of the various modernist art groups as their patron. An annual literary festival Brunonalia is held in Klimont√≥w, Poland, his birthplace, where one of the streets is also named after him. Early life Wiktor Bruno Zysman was born at Klimont√≥w, Congress Poland, to the family of Jakub Zysman, who was of Jewish origin. Wiktor's mother, Eufemia Maria (n√©e Modzelewska), came from a Catholic Polish szlachta (nobility) family. Jakub Zysman was a prominent local doctor and social worker, active in Klimont√≥w intelligentsia. Zysman converted to Lutheranism to be able to marry Eufemia Maria. They had three children: Wiktor Bruno, Jerzy, and Irena. Jasie≈Ñski attended a gymnasium secondary school in Warsaw. In 1914, as World War I raged on, his family relocated to Russia proper, where in 1918 he graduated from a secondary school in Moscow. There, his fascination with Igor Severyanin's Ego-Futurism started, followed by readings of Velimir Chlebnikov, Vladimir Mayakovsky and Alexiey Kruchonykh's so-called Visual poems. Literary career and political activism =In Poland= In 1918 Jasie≈Ñski arrived in Krak√≥w, where he attended courses in Polish literature, law and philosophy at the Jagiellonian University and became active in the avant-garde circles. In 1919, he became one of the founders of a club of Futurists named Katarynka (Barrel Organ), to suggest identification with the common people and anti-elitism of its members. His pursuits included literary productions and social activities in Krak√≥w, Warsaw, and elsewhere in Poland. Among his collaborators were Stanis≈Çaw M≈Çodo≈ºeniec, Tytus Czy≈ºewski, Anatol Stern and Aleksander Wat. In 1921 Jasie≈Ñski published one of his first Futurist works, Nu≈º w b≈ºuhu ('Knife in the Stomach', with intentional misspellings in the title) and, together with M≈Çodo≈ºeniec, became known as one of the founders of the Polish Futurist movement. The same year he published a number of other works, including manifestos, leaflets, posters and various kinds of new art, formerly unknown in Poland. A volume of his poems entitled But w butonierce ('A Boot in the Boutonniere') was published in Warsaw. He gained much fame as an enfant terrible of Polish literature and was well-received by critics in many Polish cities, including Warsaw and Lw√≥w, where he met Marian Hemar. Jasie≈Ñski collaborated with various newspapers, such as the leftist Trybuna Robotnicza, Nowa Kultura and Zwrotnica. In 1922, Pie≈õ≈Ñ o g≈Çodzie ('Song of Hunger') was published, followed in 1924 by Ziemia na lewo ('Earth Leftwards', written together with Stern). In 1923 he married Klara Arem, daughter of a merchant from Lw√≥w. That year Jasie≈Ñski witnessed a workers' rebellion in Krak√≥w, which prompted him to join the Polish communist movement. He gave public lectures on Marxist philosophy and revolutionary strategies for class struggle. =In France= Persecuted by the police, Jasie≈Ñski and his wife moved to France in 1925; they settled in Paris in Passage Poissonniere. The couple lived a humble life, making ends meet as journalists and correspondents of various Polish newspapers. Jasie≈Ñski, together with Zygmunt Modzelewski, formed an amateur theatre for the Polish worker diaspora living in Saint-Denis. He wrote numerous poems, essays and books, many of which expressed his radical views. Jasie≈Ñski became an active member of the French Communist Party. He pursued library research on the 1846 peasant uprising of Jakub Szela in the Austrian Partition of Poland and on Polish folklore. He wrote the poem S≈Çowo o Jakubie Szeli ('A note on Jakub Szela'). In 1928, he serialised the work which secured his reputation, Palƒô Pary≈º ('I burn Paris'), a Futurist-Catastrophist novel depicting the collapse and decay of the city and social tensions within capitalist societies. It was published in the leftist L'Humanit√© newspaper in French as Je br√ªle Paris, which was soon translated into Russian. In 1929, the original Polish text was published in Warsaw. The novel was also a humorous reply to Paul Morand's pamphlet I Burn Moscow, published shortly before. It gained Jasie≈Ñski much fame in France, but also became the main reason why in 1929 he was deported from the country, ostensibly for disseminating dangerous political propaganda. Not admitted to Belgium and Luxembourg, he moved to Germany and stayed in Frankfurt for a while. After the withdrawal of the extradition order he returned to France, only to be expelled once more. =In the Soviet Union= In 1929 Jasie≈Ñski moved to the Soviet Union and settled in Leningrad, where he accepted Soviet citizenship and was promoted by the authorities. The first Russian edition of I Burn Paris was issued in 130,000 copies and sold out in one day. The same year his son was born and Jasie≈Ñski became editor-in-chief of Kultura mas ('Culture of the Masses'), a Polish language monthly, and a journalist for the Soviet Tribune. He divorced Klara and married Anna Berzin, with whom he had a daughter. Jasie≈Ñski began to write in Russian; he produced a play (1931), a novel, and collections of stories. In 1932, he transferred from the Polish division of the French Communist Party to the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and soon became a prominent member of that organization. He relocated to Moscow. He served in various posts in literary departments of the communist party and at the Union of Soviet Writers. He was granted honorary citizenship of Tajikistan. By the mid-1930s, he became a strong supporter of Genrikh Yagoda's political purges within the writers' community; according to Wat, Jasie≈Ñski was active in the campaign against Isaac Babel. From 1933 to 1937, he worked on the editorial staff of the multilingual magazine Internatsionalnaya Literatura ('International Literature'). However, in 1937 Yagoda himself was arrested and Jasie≈Ñski lost a powerful protector. Soon afterwards, Jasie≈Ñski's former wife Klara, allegedly involved in an affair with Yagoda, was also arrested, sentenced to death and executed. Jasie≈Ñski was expelled from the party and he too was caught up in the purges. Sentenced to 15 years in a labour camp, he perished, possibly executed on 17 September 1938 in Butyrka prison in Moscow. He was rehabilitated in 1955. Family Jasie≈Ñski's second wife Anna was arrested in 1939 and was imprisoned in Soviet gulags for seventeen years. His underage son was sent to an orphanage to be brought up with no knowledge of his or his family's past. He escaped during World War II. After the war, he became prominent in Russia's criminal underworld. Having eventually discovered his true origins, he adopted a Polish name and became active in dissident organizations opposing the communist regime. He was killed in the 1970s.

It was named after a brand of synthesizer, the Korg Polysix. The band started in 1997, but got their big break in 1998 at a concert in Tokyo. They create high energy music, fusing conventional guitar music with synthesized and computer generated sound to create a unique mixture of punk and synthpop heavily inspired by the American bands Devo and The Tubes, as well as Japanese bands such as P-Model and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Their song lyrics often consist of Japanese, English, or just downright gibberish. The band has been noted for their extremely energetic live performances and their wild gimmicky outfits, notably their straight-bar sunglasses and trademark orange boiler suits stamped with a simple \\"P\\". History Hiroyuki Hayashi plays guitar at a POLYSICS live show in 2003, supporting the US release of the album Neu Polysics was formed in 1997 by Japanese high-school student Hiroyuki Hayashi. After watching some live footage of Devo and becoming inspired by new wave music of the West, Hayashi quit his soccer team and formed a band to expand on the cartoonish image and musical ideas of the zany art-punk icons he had seen on TV. He was joined by drummer Junichi Sugai and Sako (aka Poly 2). Another member named Kaneko joined within the early years of the band, but he left and was soon replaced by Kayo. Kayo's mechanical stage presence provided an asymmetrical dynamic to the frenetic antics of the other three members. The name of the band derives from the first synthesizer owned by Hayashi, the Korg Polysix. This synth appears in two of their early music videos. In 1999, Polysics released their first albums 1st P and A.D.S.R.M! on the independent label DECKREC Records. Just after the release of 1st P their bassist, known only as \\"POLY-2\\", left. The band dropped the \\"POLY-X\\" names, and reduced to a trio, with new member Fumi on Bass Support on some of the tracks from Neu. In 1999, Asian Man Records released their US debut album, Hey! Bob! My Friend! to rave reviews, but weak sales. The album was a compilation of tracks from their first two Japanese releases. In 2000, Polysics signed to Ki/oon Records (a subsidiary of Sony Music Japan Inc.) and released their first major album Neu. The album carried with it the same manic energy as their independent releases but more refined. On the 2001 album Eno, Synthesizers became more prevalent in the mix, but the songs still had an intense punk-like energy. For this album, Fumi applied as a full member, returning Polysics to a quartet. 2002 saw the release of the album For Young Electric Pop, Polysics' attempt at a pop album. The manic punk energy was minimized, but the band showed it had an amazing sense of harmony and style. In 2003, Neu was released in the United States on Asian Man Records to rave reviews and great sales. However, shortly after recording the Kaja Kaja Goo EP drummer Junichi Sugai left the band. Ishimaru (drummer for the punk group Snail Ramp) temporarily joined as a replacement. For the 2003 album National P, Polysics went to the US to tour, which was then captured on the PippikkippippiP In USA DVD. Also during 2003, Polysics appeared on UK television for the programme Adam & Joe Go Tokyo performing \\"Kaja Kaja Goo\\". In 2004, Polysics released a greatest hits compilation titled Polysics or Die!!!! in Europe and the United States. Yano had also replaced Sugai as the new drummer for the band in this year. Polysics toured Europe and the US for the 2005 US Release of Polysics or Die!!!!. With the early 2006 release of Now Is the Time!, they toured the US and the UK, supporting high- profile UK artists such as Graham Coxon and Kaiser Chiefs. On February 28, 2007 Polysics released their album Karate House in Japan. Following this Polysics signed for MySpace Records making plans to re-release Polysics or Die!!!! in the US, with the inclusion of the latest singles from Karate House and a bonus DVD of videos and live cuts. Polysics or Die!!!! Vista was released on October 9, 2007 for Myspace Records exclusively for the United States, to mark the band's ten-year anniversary. Hayashi did a remix of the \\"Teen Titans Theme\\" by JPop group Puffy AmiYumi. The song \\"Teen Titans Theme ~POLYSICS' CR-06 MIX~\\" appears on their US album Splurge. On April 23, 2008, We Ate the Machine was released in Japan. It was released on September 30, 2008 in North America. In their newsletter it was announced that Kayo's last day with Polysics would be March 14, 2010, the day of their huge Nippon Budokan concert. She says that she has spent happy and quality time with the band, but she wants to live on as a woman and not a musician.Kayo's departure announcement (Japanese) Their Budokan concert, BUDOKAN OR DIE!!!! 2010.3.14, was released on July 7, 2010 on both DVD and Blu-ray. On August 8, 2010 they came back from their hiatus during the Rock in Japan Festival as a trio in brand new outfits and visors. They covered Buck-Tick's \\"Sid Vicious on the Beach\\" for Parade II -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick-, released on July 4, 2012. In 2018, Polysics started a side project called The Vocoders, with a presentation modeled off Kraftwerk. Influences In Hiroyuki's words, Polysics is inspired by \\"the spirit of Devo.\\" Obvious references to Devo have been made in Polysics videos, and songs. The band has also covered \\"Jerking Back And Forth\\", \\"Social Fools\\", \\"Secret Agent Man\\" and on their 15th anniversary album, 15th P, Devo front man, Mark Mothersbaugh joined the band to perform a new version of \\"Mecha-Mania Boy\\". Polysics have also creatively repurposed Devo and other new wave/punk material in their own original songs; for instance, in the song \\"Each Life Each End\\" from the album \\"Neu\\" they borrow the opening riff from the Devo song \\"Girl U Want\\" (along with a sample from \\"Love Missile F1-11\\" by Sigue Sigue Sputnik), and the lyrics are playfully paraphrased from Devo's \\"The Day My Baby Gave Me A Surprise\\" and \\"Red Eye Express.\\" The tributes even extend to the album art; in a miniposter included with the album \\"National P\\", the members of Polysics are shown seated around a picnic blanket, about to eat cakes shaped like Devo's famous red Energy Dome headgear. In addition, the giant robot mascot from the cover of their \\"Lo-Bits\\" EP sports a battle helmet that resembles the same iconic dome. While Polysics claim Devo as their most prevalent influence, other bands and artists that have influenced their music, are occasionally referenced in their album or song titles, and whose music has sometime been repurposed in similar ways include Neu!, Brian Eno, XTC, Yellow Magic Orchestra, P-Model (who they have opened for), Talking Heads, Sparks, The B-52's, King Crimson, Kraftwerk, Denki Groove, Nirvana, Man or Astroman, Spoozys, and David Bowie, Hikashu and Plastics. Polysics have covered songs by Devo, Styx, Suzi Quatro, Plastics, The Ramones, The Knack, Soft Cell, Hikashu, Thin Lizzy, P-Model and Frank Sinatra and have been known to play Yes during their sound checks.

A 1955 Canadian stamp with a CPR (Canadian Pacific Railway) perfin. In philately, a perfin is a stamp that has had initials or a name perforated across it to discourage theft. The name is a contraction of perforated initials or perforated insignia. They are also sometimes called SPIFS (Stamps Perforated with Initials of Firms and Societies).  History  Great Britain was the first country to use perfins, beginning in 1868.Toke N√∏rby. The Story about the SPIFS and PERFINs ‚Äî See Part 4. The Authorizations to Perforate Stamps. The practice spread quickly to Belgium (1872); Denmark, France, Germany and Switzerland (1876); and Austria (1877); the U.S. finally allowed perfins in 1908. In Britain unused postage stamps could be redeemed for cash at the post office. By agreement with postal authorities, a perfin stamp on a letter could be used only by the owner of the perfin. Therefore, a stolen perforated stamp would be of no value to the unauthorized bearer. Thus the use of perfins gave organizations better security over their postage. The demise of the perfin came about by the widespread use of postage meter machines which obviated the need for perfins. Officially prepared perfins A number of countries have perforated stamps to denote official mail. Denmark punctured stamps for use by the Danish Home Guard.Brug af frim√¶rker i Hjemmev√¶rnet. The United States has punctured stamps for use by various Federal organisations and Australian states such as Victoria and Queensland used perfins widely on their stamps. Collecting perfins Formerly considered damaged and not worth collecting, perforated postage stamps are now highly sought after by specialist collectors. It is often difficult to identify the originating uses of individual perfins because there are usually no identifying features; for instance the Kodak company used a simple K as their perfin, but on its own a stamp perforated K could have been used by several other users. A K perfin still affixed to a cover that has some company identifying feature, like the company name, address, or even a postmark or cancellation of a town where the company had offices, enhances such a perfin. Note that the block of 12 stamps illustrated on the right includes two copies of the highly sought-after erroneous 5-cent denomination instead of 2 cents.\\"Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalog\\" (Scott Publishing Co., Sidney, OH, published annually), Vol. 1.

He was found guilty of extortion, and, according to a committee of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into the state of English gaols, arbitrarily and unlawfully loaded with irons, put into dungeons, and destroyed prisoners for debt, treating them in the most barbarous and cruel manner, in violation of the law.

Like his father, Richard fitz Gilbert has since become commonly known by his nickname Strongbow (Norman French: Arc- Fort), which may be a mistranscription or mistranslation of \\"Striguil.\\" His son Gilbert de Striguil (or de Strigoil) died unmarried before 1189 and the earldom passed via Richard's daughter Isabel to her spouse William Marshall. Cognomen Richard's cognomen Strongbow has become the name he is best known by, but it is unlikely that he was called that during his lifetime. Cognomens of other Cambro-Norman and Norman lords were exclusively Norman-French as the nobility spoke French and, with few exceptions, official documents were written in Latin during this period. The confusion seems to have arisen when Richard's name was being translated into Latin.Goodrich Castle and the families of Godric Mapson, Monmouth, Clare, Marshall, Montchesney, Valence, Despenser and Talbot In the Domesday Exchequer annals between 1300 and 1304 (over 120 years after his death) it was written as \\"Ricardus cognomento Stranghose Comes Strugulliae (Richard known as Stranghose earl of Striguil).\\" This chronicler erroneously has attributed Stranghose (foreign leggings) as a cognomen, where it is much more likely a variant spelling or mistranscription of Striguil, which is called Strangboge, Stranboue or Stranbohe in other transcriptions. It is in the fourteenth century that we have Richard's name finally rendered as Strongbow: \\"Earl Richard son of Gilbert Strongbow [earl of Shropshire].\\"Brut y Tywysogyon or The Chronicle of the Princes.

Jones [Cardiff, 1971], 170. Seal of Richard de Clare. Career Richard was the son of Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke and Isabel de Beaumont.Cokayne 1945, p. 352 Richard's father died in about 1148, when he was roughly 18 years old, and Richard inherited the title 'count of Strigoil' Earl of Pembroke. It is probable that this title was not recognized at Henry II's coronation in 1154.M. T. Flanagan, 'Clare, Richard fitz Gilbert de, second earl of Pembroke (c.1130‚Äì1176)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press (2004) As the son of the first 'earl', he succeeded to his father's estates in 1148, but was deprived of the title by King Henry II of England in 1154 for siding with King Stephen of England against Henry's mother, the Empress Matilda.Warren 1973, p. 193 Richard was in fact, called by his contemporaries Count Striguil, for his marcher lordship of Striguil where he had a fortress at a place now called Chepstow, in Monmouthshire on the River Wye.Orpen 1911, pp. 85‚Äì9 He saw an opportunity to reverse his bad fortune in 1168 when he met Diarmait Mac Murchada, the deposed King of Leinster.Warren 1973, p. 114 =Dispossession of the King of Leinster= In 1167, Diarmait Mac Murchada was deprived of the Kingdom of Leinster by the High King of Ireland ‚Äì Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair. The grounds for the dispossession were that Mac Murchada had, in 1152, abducted Dervorgilla, the wife of the King of Breifne, Tiernan O'Rourke (). To recover his kingdom, Mac Murchada solicited help from the King of England ‚Äì Henry II. The deposed king embarked for Bristol from near Bannow on 1 August 1166.The Oxford Illustrated History of Ireland, ed. R. F. Foster (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 57 He met Henry in Aquitaine in the Autumn of 1166. Henry could not help him at this time, but provided a letter of comfort for willing supporters of Mac Murchada's cause in his kingdom. However, after his return to Wales, he failed to rally any forces to his standard. He eventually met the count of Striguil (nicknamed \\"Strongbow\\") and other barons of the Welsh Marches. Mac Murchada came to an agreement with Richard de Clare: for the Earl's assistance with an army the following spring, he could have Aoife, Mac Murchada's eldest daughter in marriage and the succession to Leinster.Orpen 1911, p. 91 As Henry's approval or licence to Mac Murchada was a general one, the count of Striguil thought it prudent to obtain Henry's specific consent to travel to Ireland: he waited two years to do this.Orpen 1911, p. 93 The licence he got was to aid Mac Murchada in the recovery of his kingdom of Leinster. =The re- taking of Leinster= Mac Murchada and Richard de Clare raised a large army, which included Welsh archers and arranged for Raymond FitzGerald (also known as Raymond le Gros) to lead it. The force took the Ostman towns of Wexford, Waterford, and DublinThese were longphorts where the Viking raiders settled, marrying Gaelic women and slightly acculturating to Gaelic customs (such as naming practices, MacGiollamhuire, MacTurkill, etc.), Dublin being the most famous. See: James F. Lydon, The Making of Ireland: From Ancient Times to Present (London; New York: Routledge, 1998), p. 21. in rapid succession between 1169 and 1170.Orpen 1911, p. 184 Richard de Clare, however, was not with the first invading party and arrived later, in August 1170.John Davies, A History of Wales (London: Penguin Group, 1993), p. 126 In May 1171, Diarmait Mac Murchada died and his son, Donal MacMurrough-Kavanagh (), claimed the kingdom of Leinster in accordance with his rights under the Brehon Laws. Richard de Clare also claimed the kingship in the right of his wife. At this time, Strongbow sent his uncle, Hervey de Montmorency, on an embassy to Henry II. This was necessary to appease the King who was growing restive at the count's increasing power. Upon his return, de Montmorency conveyed the King's terms ‚Äì the return of Richard de Clare's lands in France, England, and Wales as well as leaving him in possession of his Irish lands.A J Otway-Ruthven; Kathleen Hughes, \\"A History of Medieval Ireland\\", (London: Ernest Benn Limited; New York: Barnes & Noble Inc., 1968), p. 48 In return, Richard de Clare surrendered Dublin, Waterford, and other fortresses to the English king.Warren 2000, p. 197 Henry's intervention was successful and both the Gaelic and Norman lords in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule;Warren 2000, p. 200 Richard de Clare also agreed to assist Henry II in his coming war in France. Henry crossed over to Ireland in October 1172 and stayed in Ireland six months. He put his own men into nearly all the important places, Richard keeping only Kildare. In 1173 Richard went in person to France to help Henry II during the rebellion by his sons, being reinstated in Leinster as a reward. In 1174 he advanced into Connaught and was severely defeated, but subsequently Raymond FitzGerald re-established his supremacy in Leinster. Marriage and issue The Marriage of Strongbow and Aoife (1854) by Daniel Maclise, a romanticised depiction of the union in the ruins of Waterford By an unknown mistress, Richard de Clare fathered two daughters: * Aline de Clare,Aline was born well before her father married Eva (Aoife), daughter of Dermot. That both she and her unnamed sister were illegitimate is indicated by the fact that neither inherited anything from their father's great holdings. See: Cokayne, CP, X, Appendix H, 103 who married William FitzMaurice FitzGerald, baron of NaasCokayne 1945, Appendix H, p. 103 * Basilia de Clare, who married Robert de Quincy, Constable of Leinster On about 26 August 1171 in Reginald's Tower, Waterford, Richard de Clare married MacMurrough's daughter, Aoife MacMurrough (anglicised as \\"Eva\\").Cokayne 1945, p. 356 Their children were: * Gilbert de Clare, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, a minor who died in 1185Cokayne 1945, p. 357 * Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke, who became Countess of Pembroke in her own right in 1185 (on the death of her brother) until her own death in 1220.Cokayne 1945, pp. 358‚Äì64 King Henry II had promised Sir William Marshal that he would be given Isabel as his bride, and his son Richard I upheld the promise one month after his ascension to the throne. The earldom was given to her husband as her consort.Thomas B. Costain The Conquering Family (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1962), p. 267 Marshall was the son of John the Marshal, by Sibylle, the sister of Patrick, Earl of Salisbury. Richard de Clare died in June 1176 of some type of infection in his leg or foot. He was buried in Holy Trinity Church in Dublin with his uncle-in-law, Lawrence, Archbishop of Dublin, presiding. King Henry II took all of Strongbow's lands and castles for himself and placed a royal official in charge of them. He protected the inheritance of Isabel. Eva was given her dower rights and possibly held Striguil [Chepstow] as part of those dower rights until the Welsh rebellion of 1184/85. There is a record of Eva confirming a charter in Ireland in 1188/89 as \\"comtissa de Hibernia\\". There are no known extant records of the personal lives of Richard de Clare and Eva. We know that this young red-haired son of Gilbert de Clare Earl of Pembroke survived the years of being deprived of his rightful inheritance. He took the gamble that Dermot MacMurchada offered. He conquered and re- constituted his inherited lordship of Leinster, married the golden-haired Eva, and re-gained the respect of king Henry II. Two interesting questions arise for which there is no known extant contemporary records. Did Richard de Clare perhaps meet the man who would be his daughter's husband in the 1173 rebellion of the young King Henry? Would Richard de Clare have approved of the knight William Marshal who married his daughter Isabel and not only regained all the land, castles and titles that Richard de Clare should have inherited, but added greatly to them?http://www.castlewales.com/is_clare.html Legacy Richard de Clare was first interred in Dublin's Christ Church Cathedral where an alleged effigy can be viewed.Alfred Webb, A compendium of Irish biography (Dublin: M.H. Gill & Son, 1878), p. 130 Richard de Clare's actual tomb-effigy was destroyed when the roof of the Cathedral collapsed in 1562. The one on display dates from around the 15th century, bears the coat of arms of an unknown knight,James Graves, 'Armorial bearings of Strongbow', Gentleman‚Äôs magazine and historical review, ccxvi, 1 (March 1864), 362‚Äì3; 'On the arms of Richard de Clare', Gentleman‚Äôs magazine and historical review, ccxviii, 1 (April 1865), 403‚Äì8; ccxvix, 2 (July 1865), 3‚Äì11; (August 1865), 207‚Äì8;(November 1865), 551‚Äì63 gives the best summary. Stuart Kinsella summarised the most recent work in a lecture to the conference on 'Monuments and Monumentality in Later Medieval and Early Modern Europe' in Stirling University in August 2011 and is the effigy of another local knight. Richard de Clare was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin within sight of the cross according to an eyewitness, Giraldus Cambrensis. There is little evidence to support the tradition that he was buried either in St Edan's Cathedral, Ferns,John Finlayson, Inscriptions on the monuments, mural tablets &c;, Christ Church Cathedral (Dublin: Hodges, Foster, & Figgis, 1878), p. 66 notes no more than a 'fearful malediction ... pronounced against him by a Bishop of Ferns' citing King's Church History, ii, 622 and Haverty's 'History of Ireland', p. 256. Christ Church Cathedral, Waterford or Dominican priory, Kilkenny. References to 'de Clare' being buried in Gloucester cathedral refer to his father, while those to 'Strongbow' in Tintern abbey refer probably to Walter or Anselm Marshall, both of whom died in 1245. In popular culture The English cider brand Strongbow is named after him.

It was originally published by Kadokawa Shoten in Comic Dragon, then a special issue of the Dragon Magazine. A 24-episode anime television series by Gonzo based on the manga ran from 2003 to 2004 on Fuji TV. The series was released in North America by ADV Manga and ADV Films, titled Chrono Crusade. Set in New York during the 1920s, Chrono Crusade follows the story of Rosette Christopher, and her demon partner Chrono. As members of the Magdalene Order, they travel around the country eliminating demonic threats to society, while Rosette searches for her lost brother, Joshua. Plot Chrono Crusade is set in the height of the Roaring Twenties, where jazz is king, bootleg liquor flows freely, and the mob rules the streets. It is a time of prosperity, luxury and decadence, and the division between rich and poor grows even wider in the wake of the First World War. It is at such times of great change and upheaval that the dark things that lurk below the world of man can come to the surface. In the world of Chrono Crusade, a fictional organization known as the Order of Magdalene (or more specifically, the characters of Sister Rosette Christopher and her soul-bound demon partner, Chrono) exists to fight the demonic threats that appear with increasing regularity across America. Both Rosette and Chrono are revealed during the course of the story to be driven by a shadowy past, centered on a search for Rosette's lost brother Joshua who is shown to have been taken from her by the sinner, Aion, a demon who shares a dark and bloody history with Chrono. He seeks nothing less than to overthrow the delicate balance between Heaven, Earth, and Hell (in the manga it is the demons' hierarchy he wished to destroy). The anime follows the manga through the events of Volume IV, but it diverges during a crucial plot event, creating different courses of events and endings. The characterization of some of the characters, including Rosette and Aion, and their roles in the story were changed drastically in the adaptation of the manga. Much of the story is driven by the individual pasts of the main characters and the complex relationships between them. =Setting= The Order of Magdalene is an organization that banishes devils and demons. The Order has many branches around the country (some that are mentioned/visited include the Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, and Seattle branches); each one is presided over by the Council of the Catholic Church. The New York branch of the Order is headed by Kate Valentine, assisted by Ewan Remington, who lead the fight against the forces of darkness. The Order has many members; however, in times of great crisis, other less generally accepted individuals may be introduced into the Order to help fight the forces of darkness. They use various weapons, mainly guns, swords, and melee weapons, many of which are developed by the New York branch's own Edward \\"Elder\\" Hamilton. The Order's preferred handgun is the Colt 1911, often loaded with Sacred, standard bullets containing holy water, and Gospel, bullets with alchemy-transformed silver. The bullet Spirit was also developed, but upon test-fire it was found to be too dangerous, using a repressed lower-class demon for its explosive power. Tetragrammaton, a gun with high power against demons with low backlash, is given to Rosette and later used by Chrono. Besides using guns, there are members of Order with special powers as well, using devices like tomes, violins, or dolls. They also use Angel Capture Fields, specialized barriers that can repel demons, their powers, and other astral based substances, and are set up by creating a rectangular array of cross-shaped stakes in the ground and activating them. The Order also developed Soul Dive, an experimental system used to dive into souls for direct exorcism. The Order also unveils its flagship, the Metatron, in the final showdown with Pandaemonium and Aion. Characters =Main= ; :* : The impulsive, 16-year-old, protagonist of Chrono Crusade. Rosette is an elite exorcist of the Order of Magdalene and goes out on missions to destroy deadly spirits and devils. Her primary motivation is to rescue her younger brother Joshua, who has been kidnapped and later brainwashed by Aion. Because of a contract she formed with Chrono when she was 12, her life is slowly ticking away. Despite this, she continues to run towards her goal, confronting every challenge with a headstrong attitude. This conviction inspires others like Chrono and Azmaria to push forward surpassing their own limitations and personal doubt. She is almost ideally unfazed by the future she chose when she made her contract with Chrono, claiming she's still going to be \\"kicking and screaming 'til the very end\\". Despite knowing exactly who and what Chrono is, she doesn't seem the least bit afraid of him and trusts him indefinitely as her partner. Rosette is somewhat simple and prone to impulsive behavior that gets her in trouble; she claims it's because she knows she's short on time and can't afford to hesitate on things she may never live to do again and later regret. Rosette's character takes a rather different turn due to events in the anime compared to the manga. : Rosette's character design remains much the same in both the anime and manga although she is significantly bustier in the anime. ; :* : Rosette's contractor, partner, and closest friend. Chrono is stoic, loyal, kind, and somewhat quiet. This mild facade of a young boy belies a fierce, full-grown demon of infamous power and utmost rage. His contract with Rosette allows him to exist without his set of horns, which were ripped from his head in an early battle with Aion prior to the initial storyline. Demons' horns allow them to absorb astral energy, which bestows both power and life. In order to maintain Rosette's remaining life force and prevent Chrono's subconscious from stealing the rest, her life's energy is kept sealed in a pocket watch that is worn around her neck, the creator of which is none other than the sinner Shader. : Despite being a demon, Chrono cherishes life and those he loves. This creates conflict whenever Rosette is required to unseal her pocket watch, allowing him to harness his immense power to defeat powerful foes or rescue them in desperate situations. Chrono will always try to persuade Rosette to think of other solutions as releasing the pocket watch not only creates pain in his partner, but also lowers her already shortened lifespan. : Whenever his powers are sealed, Chrono retains the form of a young boy who appears extremely docile and rather charming, often surprising the humans he is familiar with. Although considered a \\"reformed\\" demon, Chrono has quite the temper, and if provoked will go into a terrifying rage that blinds him from most everything around him, including the people he cares about. Despite this, Chrono is deathly afraid of hurting others, or of being unable to protect those most important to him. His shadowy past with Aion and the series' namesake Mary Magdalene is what motivates him to accept Rosette's contract despite the pain she will suffer and the end that he sees ahead. In the manga, Rosette has unsealed Chrono significantly more times than in the anime. ; :* : The Apostle of Charity and Songstress of Vegas. Azmaria is a 12-year-old girl with the gift of healing with song. Sensitive and fearful, Azmaria is initially more of a liability to Rosette and Chrono than she is an asset. She was traded among families like a trophy for most of her life, so her self-confidence and feeling of self-worth is extremely low. She has a spectacular soprano singing voice, and as such began her young life singing with a Portuguese orchestra, but when it was discovered that her singing voice had healing powers and marked her as an Apostle, she became an object of pursuit. After rescuing her as part of the Order's roundup of the Apostles, Rosette and Chrono soon make it their personal mission to help Azmaria to value herself just as much as she does others. She is hardworking, diligent, and very eager, and idolizes Rosette as an older sister and mentor. : Being an apostle, although bestowed with immense power, Azmaria is also conflicted with a curse, the curse of misfortune. While Joshua is plagued with poor health, those who come into contact with Azmaria will meet misfortune and suffering. ; :* : A beautiful German jewel summoner and bounty hunter who specialize in demons. Her entire family was wiped out by a \\"hornless demon\\" leaving only herself and her older sister Florette (AKA Fiore) alive. She was then raised by her kind butler Steiner, who still remains by her side. She is now on the search for her sister, who was taken from the massacre by the demon. At first she feels uncomfortable around Rosette and the others due to their trust with Chrono, a hornless devil she thought was responsible for her suffering. This changed after spending time with them, she recognizes them as friends and worthy comrades in battle. In the Manga, she is significantly friendlier with the others, and even flirts around with Chrono, much to the annoyance of Rosette. : Although highly irritated at Azmaria for her clumsy ways, Satella truly cares as she sees a part of her former self in her when she was younger. After hearing Azmaria's soprano voice, she is proud of the young apostle and states that there are good point to her after all. Satella firmly believes that to move forward and grow, one must identify weaknesses first. : Although never stated, Satella's connections with demons may run deeper than she thought. In Fiore's memories, Aion came to their home to enlist the help of their father, who the antagonist states was their elder and teacher. With his refusal, the family home was razed and the family killed. From this, it is possible to assume that both Satella and Fiore may be part demon. : Her ending is changed significantly between the anime and the manga. =Magdalene Order= ; :* : Head of the New York Branch of the Magdalene Order. She is a strong willed woman who often seems out of place fighting demons and devils. She leads the order with an iron resolve, making sure the New York Branch Office runs as smooth as clockwork. She also distrusts Chrono despite his gentle nature due to his status as a demon. She is openly irritated with Rosette due to her aloof ways but deep down, she truly cares for her. : Sister Kate is later demoted when Chrono loses his sanity and openly attacks Viede and Aion in San Francisco causing countless casualties and revealing to the public the presence of demons. ; :* : The minister of the Magdalene Order. He also serves as a field agent and second in command to Sister Kate. In the Anime, towards the end he leaves the Order. He is seen quite a while later, looking about the same age but unshaven, when the third Prophecy of Fatima happens, just before, seeing someone who appears similar, if not the same, to Aion. He also has the apparent ability to warp, moving from the Magdalene NY HQ to a carnival in San Francisco instantly without anyone's notice. Immediately afterward, during the phone conversation with Sister Kate, he states that he is an Angel, and implied to be a \\"fallen\\" one. In the manga, it is revealed that he had initial history with Chrono as he was the boy who failed to save Mary Magdalene from being kidnapped by Chrono. It is revealed that he suffered an injury that would have ended his duty in the order but volunteered to be infused with Legion (a devil's equivalent to cells) in order to continue his work. After the events of the story, he retires but continues his duty as a father of the Catholic Church. ; :* : Edward is the person who makes the weapons used by the exorcists. He also has a great love for women which is why he may appear perverted, though he greatly cares for all the girls. Although he appears aloof and whimsical, Elder can display great authority and leadership spurring those around him including Sister Kate into action. : Elder was involved prior to the initial story involving Mary Magdalene. He was the first one who accompanied Mary from the orphanage and explained her powers to her. He later accompanies the young Ewan in their pursuit of Chrono who kidnapped her from the Order. ; :*Voiced by: Yuki Masuda (Japanese), Mandy Clark (Eps. 01 ‚Äì 15), Brittney Karbowski (Eps. 16 ‚Äì 24) (English) ;Sister Claire :*Voiced by: Noriko Rikimaru (Japanese); Sasha Paysinger (English) ;Sister Mary Magdalene :*Voiced by: Ema Kogure (Japanese); Michelle Maulsby (English) : Mary is the foreseeing Holy Maiden after whom the Order was named after. Having spent most her life inside the Order, she was more than willing to follow Chrono to the outside world. In the manga, after her 'abduction' by Chrono, she becomes close friends with the Sinners notably with Chrono, whom is implied to have developed feelings for her. She was killed by Aion, who was controlled by Pandemonium, and mourned by Chrono who then left the Sinners due to the seeming lack of alternative. =Pursuers= ; :* : The leader of his own army. In the anime, he allied with the Magdalene Order to fight against the Sinners and managed to eliminate Genai. He led his troops in an attack on Aion but was slain along with the rest when sprayed with Rosette's blood. In the manga, he appears much later in the story scouting the city in his human form. Duke Duffau led the assault on Eden and fought well against Aion with his bare hands. He ultimately falls when a geas is cast on all demons worldwide leaving him immobile and open to execution by Aion who has ripped out his own horns to escape the geas. ; :* : One of the members of Duke Duffau's army. He was killed along with his enemy Viede (one of Aion's Sinners). ; :* : One of the members of Duke Duffau's army. He followed Duffau on the attack against Aion but was wounded by Rosette's holy blood. He managed to escape and went back to Chrono to warn him about Rosette, but died of wounds soon after. =Sinners= ; :* : The antagonist of the anime/manga series, a Sinner and a demon, and also Chrono's twin older brother. He is after all of the Apostles, including Azmaria, for reasons that are unknown until Chrono reveals them. In the manga, his goal is to rebuild the world out of the \\"system\\" that binds everyone to their respective roles. : Aion is very intelligent and manipulative while still remaining charismatic to those around him. Throughout the manga, his goals remain ambiguous until the last volume. Although he is the antagonist of the series, he can not easily be classified as \\"bad\\", although his views and methods are highly controversial. He is fighting \\"Pandemonium\\", the system that maintains the roles that each of his siblings much take. If they were to ever reach a higher domain like himself, they will have learned too much and are disposed of. ; :* : He holds allegiance to Aion's Sinners, and is also the Apostle of Hope and Rosette's younger brother. He is able to freeze people's time with the use of Chrono's devil horns, granted to him by Aion. He was tricked into taking Chrono's horns and followed Aion because he didn't want Rosette to have to take care of him all the time. He wanted to be strong enough to take care of her and be her support. : Like Azmaria, Joshua was afflicted with the curse of ill health and suffering. Although he could heal the wounds of others, he could never alleviate his own suffering and is usually confined to a bed. He took Chrono's horns so that he could be stronger and fulfill his promise to become an explorer with his sister. : Both Joshua and Rosette were left orphaned when their parents went missing after their ship sank. He knows that the grave stone they attend is not real as their parents' bodies were never found. As a result, he pledged never to grow old as adults lie and hurt others. ; :* : Fiore is a very powerful jewel summoner who is Joshua's caretaker/maid (whom he refers to as \\"older sister\\"). When she was younger she was taken by Aion, who erased her memory. Aion replaced her memories of Satella with memories of Joshua, which in turn makes her think that Joshua is her brother. She is completely devoted to Aion and Joshua, vowing to always protect Joshua no matter what. Later when she encountered her sister Satella she had no idea who she was. However, in the manga, she retained her memories and insisted that her existence as \\"Florette\\" ceased the day she died. In her fight with Satella, it is revealed that she is a mannequin and could reattach any limbs which were severed. : Fiore makes the gems that the sinners wear allowing them to fight without their horns. ; :* : A spider-like sinner who sends out miniature spiders who latch onto the necks of her victims allowing her to control them like marionettes. All she desires is to be helpful to Aion. She is one of the six members of Aion's team and the first one to be killed. Her waist was slashed by Pandemonium's claws killing off the legion that reside there. As a result, she forever lost the lower half of her body which are now replaced by metal legs much like a spider. : Her death in the anime is slightly different from the one in the manga. In the anime, she vanished when she fell off the train screaming all the way. In the manga, the upper half of her body is shown floating away in the stream beneath the bridge. Chrono contacts her through one of her spiders and she laments if only he never left. She mocks Rosette one last time before she quietly dies drifting away. ; :* : She is one of the six members of Aion's team. She is animorphic with both cat ears and tail who also displays cat like behavior like enjoying a nice pat/rub and favoring fish as her food. Shader is the one that invented the devices Chrono and Aion have to absorb \\"astral\\" since they no longer have horns to absorb energy from the Astral Line. She's the fourth to be killed by Remington. In the manga she survives the events of the main story and continues to live in modern America with Fiore. ; :* : He is one of the six members of Aion's team and the second to be killed along with his enemy Carv. A massive hulk, Viede is normally paired off with Genai on missions and as defense. His quiet and thoughtful manner is in stark contrast to Genai's outburst's and irrational behavior. Although he was injured fighting Pandemonium, he was only affected by the force field she threw up rather than the claws she slashed with and was able to make a full recovery. In the manga he dies defending Eden against the order and Pandemoniums' pursuers. ; :* : He is one of the six members of Aion's team. He wanted to avenge Rizelle after learning that she had been killed. He's the third to be killed by Duke Duffau. In the manga, he displayed fondness to Rizelle and was greatly angered at her death to the point that he challenged Aion with his decision. : Genai's left arm and eyes were slashed by Pandemonium's claws and as such the legion that reside there have died off. Aion had Shader construct metal appendages to replace the killed off limbs. Genai wears a mask that covers his eyes which hide eyes sewn shut. He slowly dies after the battle on Eden against the pursuers and the Order. As he dies, he reaches his arm towards the sky saying how beautiful the sky is and whether Rizelle could see them too. Terminology ;Militia : Highly experienced personnel of the Order. These agents are normally sent out in the field on missions either partnered or solo. In order to acquire this position, one must be with the order for a number of years and satisfactorily complete a test that the branch director approves. Rosette obtains this level after she was able to exorcise a demon from Azmaria after taking a dive. ;Dive : Dive is the process of literally diving into the soul of an individual in order to exorcise a demon or to contact them from within once they have withdrawn from the outside world. Dive can be done on both humans and demons with the latter posing significant risks and dangers. : In order to perform a dive, special equipment must be attached to both individuals. Once done the diver can hence 'dive' the moment they place on the visor. ;Sinners : Sinners are demons who have separated themselves from the demon hive Pandemonium and openly rebelled. In the case of the story, after Aion reached a higher domain and acquired forbidden knowledge, he was classified as a sinner with both him and his brood marked for execution. As a result, he becomes the de facto leader of this group who eventually fight their way to freedom on Eden although many comrades were lost. : Of the sinners only Joshua and Fiore are not demons. ;Pursuers : As the name suggests, pursuers are demons sent by the elders of Pandemonium to eradicate the defected sinners. The strength of their demons varies from weak to powerful with numbers many times over those of the sinners. Production In an interview with ADV Manga, Daisuke Moriyama expressed his own opinion about the differences and similarities of the anime and manga, with one of them being the theme of the story. Although the bond between Chrono and Rosette and the idea of time running out were the same, Moriyama felt that the anime and manga showed this theme in different ways. While the anime centered more on the currents of time, fate and trust, Moriyama believed that the manga focused more on the Rosette's individual ideology and how the potential strength of her will can change her current situation. In producing the English-language version, ADV did extensive research in keeping the slang words within 1920s canon. One word, \\"bimbo\\", is explained to mean a tough man in 1920s slang, while the modern version refers to a stupid female.Chrono Crusade DVD 1 A Plague of Demons Commentary Track. . The English voice actors for Rosette and Chrono (Hilary Haag and Greg Ayres) nearly lost their voices on numerous occasions due to the fast-paced voice work demanded by the anime. Media =Manga= Written and illustrated by Daisuke Moriyama, Chrono Crusade has 59 chapters, called \\"Acts\\". It premiered in the November 1998 issue Dragon Age and ran until its conclusion in the June 2004 issue. The individual chapters were published in eight tank≈çbon volumes by Kadokawa Shoten from December 1999 to September 2004. The series was licensed for English language release in North America by ADV Manga in 2004. In addition to releasing all eight volumes of the series, ADV Manga published some of the series chapters in its anime and manga magazine Newtype USA. The series was released in English in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. It was also licensed for regional language releases in France by Asuka, in Mexico by Grupo Editorial Vid, in Italy by Planet Manga, in Germany by Carlsen Comics, in Hungary by Mangafan and in Denmark and Sweden by Mangismo. Most recently, a reprint of Chrono Crusade was released in Japan, beginning in January 2010 and releasing two volumes per month. These featured brand-new book design and artwork. Of note is the crucial spelling correction from \\"Chrno\\" to \\"Chrono\\", following the statement made by Moriyama's publishers during the original serialization apologizing for the typo. The series logo itself underwent a massive change, perhaps as a disambiguation from the logos of the video games Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, which also incorporated a clock within the first C in the title and was cause for some confusion among fans. The reprint features brand-new artwork on each volume with minimal ornamentation, featuring one character each (in order, Rosette, Chrono, Satella, Azmaria, Aion, Mary, Fiore) until the last volume, which featured a collage of the main cast, including Joshua, Sister Kate, and Father Remington. =Anime= An anime television series by Gonzo based on the manga first aired on Fuji TV in Japan on November 23, 2003 and ran for 24 episodes until its conclusion on June 10, 2004.

The act has been through a number of line-up changes over the years, including American singers, songwriters and rappers Thea Austin, Turbo B, and Penny Ford. Their best known hits are \\"The Power\\" and \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer\\", both of which took the No. 1 spot in multiple countries. Musical career =Previous projects= Luca Anzilotti and Michael M√ºnzing started working together in 1985 in the group Off (Organisation For Fun) with Sven V√§th. They recorded two albums, Organisation For Fun (1988) and Ask Yourself (1989), and a series of singles, including \\"Electrica Salsa\\", until 1990. The two created the side project 16 BIT in 1986 and had a big success with their first single \\"Where Are You?\\". In 1987, they released the album Inaxycvgtgb for BMG. =Formation and first album= Michael M√ºnzing and Luca Anzilotti formed Snap! in 1989 under the aliases Benito Benites and John \\"Virgo\\" Garrett III, as they thought that the public had negative preconceived ideas of German music. Their first hit \\"The Power\\", which was fronted by rapper Turbo B. and American singer Penny Ford, peaked at No. 2 in Germany in April 1990 and spent five weeks in that position eventually going Gold for sales of 250,000 units. The single topped the charts in the United Kingdom, and picked up a Silver award for sales of 200,000 units. In the U.S., it reached No.2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Platinum for 1,000,000 units. Jackie Harris was used to mime Penny Ford's voice in the video \\"The Power\\" and left the group shortly after and Penny Ford became its full-time lead singer, recording the second single \\"Ooops Up\\", a re-working of \\"I Don't Believe You Want to Get Up and Dance (Ooops!)\\", a 1980 hit by The Gap Band, with which Penny was a former backing singer. The song \\"Oops Up\\" was another No. 2 hit in Germany which spent nine weeks in the position. The single entered the Top 5 in the UK picking up another Silver award, it was also awarded a Gold certification in the U.S. Further hits followed with the oriental-sounding \\"Cult of Snap\\", which charted at No. 3 in Germany and No. 8 in the UK, and \\"Mary Had a Little Boy\\", which charted at No. 4 in Germany, and again No. 8 in the UK. Their first album World Power reached No. 7 in Germany, No. 10 in the UK and No. 30 in the U.S. The album received Platinum in Germany, and Gold in the UK and the U.S. =Second album= In 1991, after American singer, composer, songwriter and dancer Thea Austin joined the line-up and helped to write \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer\\", which was initially planned to be the lead single from the second album but later was pushed back to be the second single from the second album. The first single, \\"Colour of Love\\" managed to peak at No. 9 in Snap!'s home of Germany, but stalled at No. 54 in the UK. \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer\\" was released as the second single in July 1992 which uses a sample from the song \\"Automan\\" by early '80s American electronic hip-hop band Newcleus, it went on to become their biggest hit yet. The single shot to No. 1 in Germany, the UK, France, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Belgium. In the U.S., it peaked at No. 5 collecting another Gold for sales of 500,000 units. At home in Germany, the single went Platinum for 500,000 units, and picked up a Gold in the UK for sales of 400,000 units. The third single \\"Exterminate\\" from the second album, which charted at No. 3 in Germany and No.2 in the UK, was awarded with a Gold certification in Germany. Despite that the second album, The Madman's Return did well in the charts, peaking at No. 3 in Germany and entering the Top 10 in the UK, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland, Turbo B decided to leave the project due to disagreements with the act's producers. The album went Gold in Germany and the UK, for sales of 250,000 units and 100,000 units respectively. Follow-up singles \\"Exterminate\\" (charting No. 2 in the UK and No. 3 in Germany) and \\"Do You See the light?\\" featured Niki Haris, a professional vocalist also known for her long-time work with Madonna, on lead vocals. =Third album= The producers, M√ºnzing and Anzilotti recruited Washington, D.C.-born American singer Summer to front the act for the third album. Summer was born Paula Brown and previously had worked as a dancer in the TV series Fame and in the Spike Lee movie, School Daze. Snap! moved towards a progressive house sound and released their first single called \\"Welcome to Tomorrow (Are You Ready?)\\" in September 1994. The single peaked at No. 4 in Germany, No. 6 in the UK and was followed by the album, also titled Welcome to Tomorrow. The second single \\"The First the Last Eternity (Till the End)\\" was a moderate hit in the UK, but managed to climb as high as No. 7 in Germany. Snap! released two more singles from the album \\"World in My Hands\\" and \\"Rame\\" (featuring Rukmani), both of which experienced a moderate chart entries. =Breakup and return= In 1996 the group was officially disbanded after releasing a greatest hits compilation called Snap! Attack: The Best of Snap!. The album included a new version of their first hit \\"The Power '96\\" and \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer '96\\". However, the act made a surprising return in 2000 with a track entitled \\"Gimme a Thrill\\", complete with a rap performed by Turbo B. and vocal from the band's newest singer Maxayn. It didn't attract much attention and peaked only at No. 11 in the German Dance Charts. A new version of \\"Do You See the Light\\" remixed by Plaything was released in 2002. The following year, a remixed album, The Cult of Snap! was released and re-worked singles were issued. \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer 2003\\" peaked at No. 7 in Germany and No. 17 in the UK, while \\"The Power (of Bhangra 2003)\\" charted moderately in Austria, Switzerland and Denmark. The act also released a re-done version of \\"Oops Up!\\" which featured vocals by NG3 and managed to enter the Swedish Charts at No. 40 and the German top 100 singles chart at No. 69. Buoyed by the success of the remixes, M√ºnzing and Anzilotti went back into the studio with male singer Damien Behanan, also known as Loc, and released the single \\"Beauty Queen\\" in September 2005 through Luma Music, which peaked inside the top10 of the German Dance Charts but it failed to enter the official charts. They would also release another digital download single in 2008 featuring Loc, Jumping!, but this also failed to chart. On 16 June 2008, a new version of \\"Rhythm Is a Dancer '08\\" was released as a CD single in the UK which peaked at No. 23 there. In 2018, rights to all recordings of Snap!, previously owned by Michael M√ºnzing and Luca Anzilotti themselves, were transferred to BMG Rights Management, a current incarnation of Bertelsmann Music Group.

On 7 July 1937, the commission published a report that, for the first time, stated that the League of Nations Mandate had become unworkable and recommended partition. The British cabinet endorsed the Partition plan in principle, but requested more information. Following the publication, in 1938 the Woodhead Commission was appointed to examine it in detail and recommend an actual partition plan. The Arabs opposed the partition plan and condemned it unanimously.Mazin B. Qumsiyeh, Popular Resistance in Palestine: A History of Hope and Empowerment (New York, 2011), p. 85. The Arab High Committee opposed the idea of a Jewish state and called for an independent state of Palestine, \\"with protection of all legitimate Jewish and other minority rights and safeguarding of reasonable British interests\\". They also demanded cessation of all Jewish immigration and land purchase. They argued that the creation of a Jewish state and lack of independent Palestine was a betrayal of the word given by Britain.Mandated Landscape: British Imperial Rule in Palestine 1929-1948British Policy in Palestine, 1937-38: From the Peel to the Woodhead Report, Bulletin of International News, Vol 15, No. 23 (Nov. 19, 1938), pp.3-7 The Zionist leadership was bitterly divided over the plan. In a resolution adopted at the 1937 Zionist Congress, the delegates rejected the specific partition plan. Yet the principle of partition is generally thought to have been \\"accepted\\" or \\"not rejected outright\\" by any major faction: the delegates empowered the leadership to pursue future negotiations.Itzhak Galnoor, Partition of Palestine, The: Decision Crossroads in the Zionist Movement, State University of New York Press 2012 p.208.

The Jewish Agency Council later attached a request that a conference be convened to explore a peaceful settlement in terms of an undivided Palestine. According to Benny Morris, Ben-Gurion and Weizmann saw it 'as a stepping stone to some further expansion and the eventual takeover of the whole of Palestine.‚ÄôBenny Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist- Arab Conflict, 1881-2001, Vintage Books 2001 pp.136-7  History page=2 The Commission was established at a time of increased violence; serious clashes between Arabs and Jews broke out in 1936 and were to last three years. On 11 November 1936, the commission arrived in Palestine to investigate the reasons behind the uprising. The Commission was charged with determining the cause of the riots, and judging the grievances of both sides. Chaim Weizmann made a speech on behalf of the Jews. On 25 November 1936, testifying before the Peel Commission, Weizmann said that there are in Europe 6,000,000 Jews ... \\"for whom the world is divided into places where they cannot live and places where they cannot enter.\\" The Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, testified in front of the commission, opposing any partition of Arab lands with the Jews. He demanded full cessation of Jewish immigration. Although the Arabs continued to boycott the Commission officially, there was a sense of urgency to respond to Weizmann's appeal to restore calm. The former Mayor of Jerusalem Ragheb Bey al-Nashashibi‚Äîwho was the Mufti's rival in the internal Palestinian arena, was thus sent to explain the Arab perspective through unofficial channels. In 1981 it was disclosed that the Jewish Agency Executive Political Department had installed microphones in the room the Commission was meeting and Ben Gurion was able to read transcripts of evidence held in camera.Teveth, Shabtai (1987) Ben-Gurion. The Burning Ground. 1886-1948. Houghton Mifflin. . p.574 Conclusions Lord Peel, 1936 Chaim Weizmann giving evidence The causes of the Arab rebellion that broke out in the previous year were judged to be \\"First, the desire of the Arabs for national independence; secondly, their antagonism to the establishment of the Jewish National Home in Palestine, quickened by their fear of Jewish domination. Among contributory causes were the effect on Arab opinion of the attainment of national independence by ‚ÄòIraq, Trans-Jordan, Egypt, Syria and the Lebanon; the rush of Jewish immigrants escaping from Central and Eastern Europe; the inequality of opportunity enjoyed by Arabs and Jews respectively in placing their case before Your Majesty‚Äôs Government and the public; the growth of Arab mistrust; Arab alarm at the continued purchase of Arab land by the intensive character and the \\"modernism\\" of Jewish nationalism; and lastly the general uncertainty, accentuated by the ambiguity of certain phrases in the Mandate, as to the ultimate intentions of the Mandatory Power.\\"Report, p. 363-364. The Commission found that the drafters of the Mandate could not have foreseen the advent of massive Jewish immigration, that they considered due to \\"drastic restriction of immigration into the United States, the advent of the National Socialist Government in Germany in 1933 and the increasing economic pressure on the Jews in Poland.\\"Report, p. 289. They wrote that \\"The continued impact of a highly intelligent and enterprising race, backed by large financial resources, on a comparatively poor indigenous community, on a different cultural level, may produce in time serious reactions.\\"Report, p. 299. The Commission found that \\"though the Arabs have benefited by the development of the country owing to Jewish immigration, this has had no conciliatory effect. On the contrary, improvement in the economic situation in Palestine has meant the deterioration of the political situation\\". Addressing the \\"Arab charge that the Jews have obtained too large a proportion of good land cannot be maintained,\\" the Commission noted that \\"Much of the land now carrying orange groves was sand dunes or swamp and uncultivated when it was purchased.\\"Report, p. 242. They write that \\"The shortage of land is, we consider, due less to the amount of land acquired by Jews than to the increase in the Arab population\\". \\"Endeavours to control the alienation of land by Arabs to Jews have not been successful. In the hills there is no more room for further close settlement by Jews; in the plains it should only be allowed under certain restrictions.\\" The Commission stated that Government have attempted to discharge the contradictory obligations of the Mandatory under conditions of great difficulty by \\"holding the balance\\" between Jews and Arabs. Repeated attempts to conciliate either race have only increased the trouble. The situation in Palestine has reached a deadlock. Development of local autonomy and selfgoverning institutions, this also has been hampered. The Commission concluded that the prospect of a unified Palestine with Jews and Arabs as fellow citizens in a common state was remote due to the highly nationalistic natures of the two communities. On the nature of the Yishuv, it wrote that \\"The Jewish National Home is no longer an experiment. The growth of its population has been accompanied by political, social and economic developments along the lines laid down at the outset. The chief novelty is the urban and industrial development. The contrast between the modern democratic and primarily European character of the National Home and that of the Arab world around it is striking. The temper of the Home is strongly nationalist. There can be no question of fusion or assimilation between Jewish and Arab cultures. The National Home cannot be half- national.\\"https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/561c6ee353d740fb8525607d00581829/08e38a718201458b052565700072b358?OpenDocument It also concluded that such a prospect was growing less realistic with time due to the nature of the Jewish education system, which was causing a rise in Jewish nationalism, writing that \\"from the ages of three or four years, when children enter the kindergarten to be taught Hebrew if they do not know it already, pride in the past of Jewry and in the National Home as an exclusively and intensely Jewish achievement is the dynamic centre-point of their whole intellectual development. The idea that they are to share their life in any way with the Arabs, that they are growing up to be fellow-citizens with Arabs in a common Palestinian state, is only recognised in the teaching of a little Arabic in the secondary schools... So far, in fact, from facilitating a better understanding between the races, the Jewish educational system is making it more and more difficult as, year by year, its production of eager Jewish nationalists mounts up.\\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=blluDQAAQBAJ&pg;=PT117&lpg;=PT117#v=onepage&q;&f;=false It wrote that Arab nationalism was also a potent force and that the two communities were more loyal to their own national leaderships than the Palestine administration: \\"Arab nationalism is as intense a force as Jewish. The Arab leaders' demand for national self-government and the shutting down of the Jewish National Home has remained unchanged since 1929. Like Jewish nationalism, Arab nationalism is stimulated by the educational system and by the growth of the Youth Movement. It has also been greatly encouraged by the recent Anglo-Egyptian and Franco-Syrian Treaties. The gulf between the races is thus already wide and will continue to widen if the present Mandate is maintained. The position of the Palestine Government between the two antagonistic communities is unenviable. There are two rival bodies -- the Arab Higher Committee allied with the Supreme Moslem Council on the one hand, and the Jewish Agency allied with the Va'ad Leumi on the other -- who make a stronger appeal to the natural loyalty of the Arab and the Jews than does the Government of Palestine. The sincere attempts of the Government to treat the two races impartially have not improved the relations between them. Nor has the policy of conciliating Arab opposition been successful. The events of last year proved that conciliation is useless.\\" The summary report statement concerning the possibility of lasting settlement states: \\"An irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national communities within the narrow bounds of one small country. There is no common ground between them. Their national aspirations are incompatible. The Arabs desire to revive the traditions of the Arab golden age. The Jews desire to show what they can achieve when restored to the land in which the Jewish nation was born. Neither of the two national ideals permits of combination in the service of a single State.LEAGUE OF NATIONS SUMMARY OF THE REPORT OF THE PALESTINE ROYAL COMMISSION.\\"  Recommendations  The Commission reached the conclusion that the Mandate had become unworkable and must be abolishedAnglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Appendix IV Palestine: Historical Background in favour of partition, as the only solution to the Arab-Jewish \\"deadlock\\". It outlined ten points on: a Treaty system between the Arab and Jewish States and the new Mandatory Government; a Mandate for the Holy places; the frontiers; the need for Inter- State Subvention; the need for British Subvention; tariffs and ports; nationality; civil service; Industrial concessions; and the Exchange of land and populations.Mandated Landscape: British Imperial Rule in Palestine 1929-1948, By Roza El-Eini, pages 320 A Treaty system based on the Iraqi- Syrian precedent, proposed: Permanent mandates for the Jerusalem area and \\"corridor\\" stretching to the Mediterranean coast at Jaffa‚Äîand the land under its authority (and accordingly, the transfer of both Arab and Jewish populations) be apportioned between an Arab and Jewish state. The Jewish side was to receive a territorially smaller portion in the mid-west and north, from Mount Carmel to south of Be'er Tuvia, as well as the Jezreel Valley and the Galilee, while the Arab state linked with Trans-Jordan was to receive territory in the south and mid-east which included Judea, Samaria, and the sizable Negev desert. The report stated that Jews contribute more per capita to the revenues of Palestine than the Arabs, and the Government has thereby been enabled to maintain public services for the Arabs at a higher level than would otherwise have been possible. Partition would mean, on the one hand, that the Arab Area would no longer profit from the taxable capacity of the Jewish Area. On the other hand, (1) the Jews would acquire a new right of sovereignty in the Jewish Area; (2) that Area, as we have defined it, would be larger than the existing area of Jewish land and settlement; (3) the Jews would be freed from their present liability for helping to promote the welfare of Arabs outside that Area. It is suggested, therefore, that the Jewish State should pay a subvention to the Arab State when Partition comes into effect. Citing the separation of Sind from Bombay and of Burma from the Indian Empire, as precedents for such financial arrangement.The Arab-Israeli Conflict: An Introduction and Documentary Reader, 1 September 2009, By Gregory S. Mahler, Alden R. W. The report stated that if Partition is to be effective in promoting a final settlement it must mean more than drawing a frontier and establishing two States. Sooner or later there should be a transfer of land and, as far as possible, an exchange of population. Citing as precedent the 1923 Greek and Turkish exchange, which addressed the constant friction between their minorities. While noting the absence of cultivable land to resettle the Arabs, which would necessitate the execution of large-scale plans for irrigation, water-storage, and development in Trans-Jordan, Beersheba and the Jordan Valley. The population exchange, if carried out, would have involved the transfer of up to 225,000 Arabs and 1,250 Jews.OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE IN 9/37: Summary of the Report of the 'Palestinian Royal Commission'Report, p. 389‚Äì391  Reactions  =The Arab reaction= The entire spectrum of Palestinian Arab society rejected the partition plan. There was widespread public opposition including in the media and by religious figures. According to Henry Laurens, the Arabs saw the publication of the plan as a ringing disavowal of every key undertaking the Mandatory authorities had made since its inception, that there would be no separate Jewish state, no land expropriations and no expulsions of people. The proposed land swaps and population transfers were seen as annulling and inverting a century of economic development of the littoral region, with, apart from Jaffa and Gaza, Palestinians dispossessed of the essential rural and urban heritage that had evolved over the preceding century of coastal development. Jerusalem was placed outside the future Palestinian state.Henry Laurens, Un mission sacr√©e de civilisation, 1922‚Äì1947, vol.2 of La Question de Palestine, , Fayard Paris pp.351‚Äì403 pp.351‚Äì52. Palestinians were shocked both by the declaration their land would be divided, and that they themselves would be denied statehood (but only a union with Transjordan), while the Jewish state, extending over a third of the country,British Policy in Palestine, 1937‚Äì38: From the Peel to the Woodhead Report, Bulletin of International News, Vol 15, No. 23 (Nov. 19, 1938), pp.3‚Äì7 would absorb the whole of the Galilee, where an overwhelming percentage of the land was owned by Arabs and Jews had only a slender presence.Philip Mattar, Encyclopedia of the Palestinians, Infobase Publishing 2005 p.366.W. F. Deedes, Words and Deedes: Selected Journalism 1931-2006, Pan Macmillan, 2013 p.289: 88,200 Arabs versus 2,900 Jews, the former controlling 1,321,000 dunums compared to the latter‚Äôs 35,900. In compensation, the Arabs were offered valuable areas to the east of Jordan and the southern portion of the Beisan sub-district where irrigation would have been possible. Indignation was widespread with Arabs complaining that the Plan had allotted to them \\"the barren mountains,\\" while the Jews would receive most of the five cultivable plains, the maritime Plain, the Acre Plain, the Marj Ibn 'Amir, Al Huleh and the Jordan ValleyRoza El-Eini, Mandated Landscape: British Imperial Rule in Palestine 1929-1948, Routledge, 2004 pp.328‚Äì329. For the Arabs, the plan envisaged giving Zionists the best land, with 82% of Palestine's principal export, citrus fruit, consigned to Jewish control. The idea of transfer of population met strong opposition. Under the Peel proposal, before transfer, there would be 1,250 Jews in the proposed Arab state, while there would be 225,000 Arabs in the Jewish state. The Peel proposal suggested a population transfer based on the model of Greece and Turkey in 1923, which would have been \\"in the last resort ... compulsory\\". It was understood on all sides that there was no way of dividing the land which would not have meant a large number of Arabs (a large minority or even a majority) in the land designated for a Jewish state. At the leadership level, there were tensions between the factions. Husseini, who according to his biographer was an \\"authoritarian who could not tolerate opposition\\", feared the recommended merger with Transjordan under the rule of King Abdullah. The latter stood to gain much from partition; reaching an accord with the Nashashibis could have consolidated his rule and left Husseini powerless. The Palestinians also opposed being consigned to the far more economically feeble society of the Transjordan. Despite some initial support by the Nashashibi family of notables and Jordan's King Abdullah,Ted Swedenburg, 'The Role of the Palestinian Peasantry in the Great Revolt 1936‚Äì1939,' in Edmund Burke III and Ira Lapidus (eds.), Islam, Politics, and Social Movements, University of California Press pp 189‚Äì194. the Arab Higher Committee (HAC) and the Nashashibis (who had strong roots in both the littoral region and Jerusalem and had defected from the HAC) opposed the partition plan and condemned it unanimously. They argued that the creation of a Jewish state and lack of independent Palestine was a betrayal of the word given by Britain, and emphatically rejected the idea of giving land to the Jews.British Policy in Palestine, 1937-38: From the Peel to the Woodhead Report, Bulletin of International News, Vol 15, No. 23 (Nov. 19, 1938), pp.3‚Äì7 This objection was accompanied by a proposal that Britain adhere to its promise of a sovereign democratic state with constitutional guarantees for the rights of the Jewish minority.Elie Podeh, Chances for Peace: Missed Opportunities in the Arab- Israeli Conflict, University of Texas Press 2015 pp.28ff. The Plan was also repudiated at the Bloudan Conference convened in Syria on 8 September, where parties from all over the Arab world rejected both the partition and establishment of a Jewish state in the Palestine Mandate. In 1937, the US Consul General at Jerusalem reported to the State Department that the Mufti refused the principle of partition and declined to consider it. The Consul said the emir Abdullah urged acceptance on the ground that realities must be faced, but wanted modification of the proposed boundaries and Arab administrations in the neutral enclave. The Consul also noted that Nashashibi sidestepped the principle, but was willing to negotiate for favorable modifications.Foreign relations of the United States diplomatic papers, 1937. The British Commonwealth, Europe, Near East and Africa Volume II, Page 894 =The Jewish reaction= On 20 August 1937, the Twentieth Zionist Congress expressed that at the time of the Balfour Declaration it was understood, that the Jewish National Home was to be established in the whole of historic Palestine, including Trans-Jordan, and that inherent in the Declaration was the possibility of the evolution of Palestine into a Jewish State.Zionist Peel Commission resolution. At Wikisource While some factions at the Congress supported the Peel Report, arguing that later the borders could be adjusted, others opposed the proposal because the Jewish State would be too small. The Congress decided to reject the specific borders recommended by the Peel Commission, but empowered its executive to negotiate a more favorable plan for a Jewish State in Palestine.Jewish Agency for Israel, Twentieth Congress - Zurich, 1937Jewish Agency for Israel, Timeline: 1937 In the wake of the Peel Commission the Jewish Agency set up committees to begin planning for the state. At the time, it had already created a complete administrative apparatus amounting to \\"a Government existing side by side with the Mandatory Government.\\" At the same Zionist Congress, David Ben-Gurion, then chairman of the executive committee of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, told those in attendance that, though \\"there could be no question...of giving up any part of the Land of Israel,... it was arguable that the ultimate goal would be achieved most quickly by accepting the Peel proposals.\\"Charles D. Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 7th ed. (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2010), 138-140. University of Arizona professor Charles D. Smith suggests that, \\"Weizmann and Ben-Gurion did not feel they had to be bound by the borders proposed [by the Peel Commission]. These could be considered temporary boundaries to be expanded in the future.\\" Ben-Gurion saw the plan as only a stage in the realisation of a larger Jewish state.Mandated Imaginations in a Regional Void. Moshe Behar, Middle East Studies Online Journal, Issue 5, Volume 2 (2011), pp. 102-104 The two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and Ben-Gurion, had convinced the Zionist Congress to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation. Aftermath The Peel Plan proved to be the master partition plan, on which all those that followed were either based, or to which they were compared, ushering in a fundamental change in the British outlook on Palestine's future. Following the report publication the British Government released a statement of policy, agreeing with its conclusions and proposing to seek from the League of Nations authority to proceed with a plan of partition. In March 1938, the British appointed the Woodhead Commission to \\"examine the Peel Commission plan in detail and to recommend an actual partition plan\\". The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out). With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State. The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to \\"political, administrative and financial difficulties\\".Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty November 1938. At the Bloudan Conference in 1937, parties from all over the Arab world rejected both the partition and establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, thus claiming all of Palestine.

With the installed capacity of , the plant is the largest power plant in Iceland. The project, named after the nearby K√°rahnj√∫kar mountains, involves damming the rivers J√∂kuls√° √° Dal and J√∂kuls√° √≠ Flj√≥tsdal with five dams, creating three reservoirs. Water from the reservoirs is diverted through of underground water tunnels and down a vertical penstock towards a single underground power station. The smelter became fully operational in 2008 and the hydropower project was completed in 2009.K√°rahnj√∫kar HEP - Landsvirkjun - September 2009 The K√°rahnj√∫kar Dam () is the centrepiece of the five dams and the largest of its type in Europe, standing tall with a length of and comprising of material. The project has been heavily criticised for its environmental impact and its use of foreign workers.  Description  The hydroelectricity project harnesses the rivers J√∂kuls√° √° Dal and J√∂kuls√° √≠ Flj√≥tsdal by creating three reservoirs with five concrete-face rock-filled embankment dams; three on the J√∂kuls√° √° Dal and two on the J√∂kuls√° √≠ Flj√≥tsdal. After being used in the Flj√≥tsdalur Power Station, all water used in electricity production is discharged into the river J√∂kuls√° √≠ Flj√≥tsdal. left Three dams on the J√∂kuls√° √° Dal; the K√°rahnj√∫kar Dam (), the Desjar√° Dam () and the Sau√∞√°rdalur Dam () create the H√°lsl√≥n Reservoir. At tall and long, the K√°rahnj√∫kar Dam is the largest dam in the project and the largest of its type in Europe as well. The tall and long Desjar√° Dam and the tall and long Sau√∞√°rdalur Dam are saddle or auxiliary dams that maintain the desired height of the H√°lsl√≥n Reservoir. Water from the long, capacity H√°lsl√≥n Reservoir (about the size of Manhattan island in New York) is diverted down a long, diameter headrace tunnel towards the Flj√≥tsdalur Power Station.Key Figures of the K√°rahnj√∫kar Hydroelectric Project The K√°rahnj√∫kar Hydropower Project Overview On the river J√∂kuls√° √≠ Flj√≥tsdal, the tall and long Keldu√° Dam forms the capacity Keldu√°rl√≥n Reservoir. Downstream from the Keldu√° Dam is the tall, long Ufsarst√≠fla dam which forms the Ufsarl√≥n, a much smaller reservoir. Water from the Ufsarl√≥n Reservoir is diverted down a long, diameter headrace tunnel where it joins the H√°lsl√≥n Reservoir headrace tunnel. Before each of the headrace tunnels from the H√°lsl√≥n Reservoir or Ufsarl√≥n Reservoir reach the underground power station, they both join to form a single combined headrace tunnel. The single headrace tunnel later splits into two long, diameter steel-lined penstocks (tunnels) and the water makes a rapid descent down a final vertical penstock into the power station. The underground Flj√≥tsdalur Power Station contains six vertical-axis Francis turbine generators rated at 115 MW each. The power station has a combined capacity of 690 MW and discharge of (averages ) into the river J√∂kuls√° √≠ Flj√≥tsdal via tailrace tunnels and canals. The power production of 4,600 GWh/year corresponds to a capacity factor of 76%, which is relatively high for a hydroelectric facility. Power produced is then transmitted to Alcoa's Fjar√∞a√°l aluminium smelter to the east in Rey√∞arfj√∂r√∞ur. = Fjar√∞a√°l aluminium smelter = The Fjar√∞a√°l aluminium smelter was completed June 2007 and reached full operation in April 2008. Construction began in 2004 and the facility contains a smelter, cast house, rod production and deep-water port. The smelter employs 450 people and produces 940 tons of aluminium a day, with capacity of 346,000 metric tons of aluminium per year. Fjar√∞a√°l means \\"Fjords Aluminium\\" in Icelandic.  History  Using the rivers J√∂kuls√° √° Dal and J√∂kuls√° √≠ Flj√≥tsdal along with other resources in eastern Iceland has been on the drawing board since the 1970s. From 1975-2002, several international companies had planned or attempted to build a metal plant at Rey√∞arfj√∂r√∞ur that would be powered by a hydroelectricity project similar to the K√°rahnj√∫kar. All failed because of opposition to the project until Alcoa along with the Government of Iceland and Landsvirkjun, Iceland's national power company committed to the massive project in 2002.Large-scale industry in East Iceland  Construction  Construction of K√°rahnj√∫kar Dam, concrete-face backside The end of the tunnel at Skri√∞uklaustur leading water from K√°rahnj√∫kar Dam to the power plant. The project is funded by Landsvirkjun, which operates the dams and Flj√≥tsdalur Power Station. The Italian company Impregilo is the largest contractor working on the dams.The Icelandic contractor Su√∞urverk hf was the main contractor working on Desjar√° Dam and Sau√∞√°rdalur Dam Karahnj√∫kar website - Impregilo The total cost of the hydropower project is 1.3 billion USD. The penstock was built in place by the German company DSD-NOELL (W√ºrzburg) whereas ATB Riva Calzoni of Italy provided intake structures, wheels gates and sliding gates. In total, more than 4,000 tons of steel were used for the steel liner. Preparatory work on the project began in August 2002 and construction on the K√°rahnj√∫kar Dam and headrace tunnels for the H√°lsl√≥n Reservoir began in April 2003. In September of the same year, construction began on the underground power station. Construction on both the Desjar√° Dam and the Sau√∞√°rdalur Dam began in April 2004. In June 2006, construction of the Keldu√° Dam and Ufsarst√≠fla Dam began and in September, the H√°lsl√≥n Reservoir began to fill. In mid-2008, the Keldu√° and Ufsarst√≠fla Dams were complete and the Ufsarl√≥n Reservoir headrace tunnel was ready.K√°rahnj√∫kar Construction Schedule Construction on the headrace tunnels was done by three full-face tunnel boring machines, while remaining areas were drilled and blasted. This was the first time that tunnel boring machines were used in Iceland. The project was documented in a MegaStructures program of the National Geographic Channel, and the Discovery Channel's Extreme Engineering, along with mention in the Sigur R√≥s 2006 documentary Heima (At Home), where the band played at a protest against the building of the dam.

He was born in St- Hyacinthe, Quebec, to a political family. His grandfather, Honor√© Mercier and his uncle, Lomer Gouin, were both former Premiers of Quebec. His grandmother's second husband was Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) and later Senator Joseph Godbout. His brother was the judge G√©rald Fauteux. Fauteux married Marguerite Barr√©, daughter of the Canadian artist and animator Raoul Barr√©, on September 18th, 1923. The couple had 4 children; Roger, Paul, Marie (Mimi) and Gaspard Jr. A dentist by training and then a businessman, he first entered politics at the provincial election defeating Quebec Conservative Party leader and Mayor of Montreal Camillien Houde to win a seat in the Quebec legislature for the Quebec Liberal Party. He lost his seat in 1935 and returned to business. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada from the Quebec riding of St. Mary in a 1942 by-election, and was re-elected in the 1945 federal election by again defeating Camillien Houde. He was re-elected in the 1949 election. In Parliament, Fauteux opposed conscription and was a delegate to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Conference that followed World War II. Despite his lack of legal training or long tenure in the House, he was tapped by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to become Speaker following the 1945 election. His inexperience in parliamentary procedure caused him difficulties in the Chair. He had a habit of making decisions before MPs had presented their arguments. He preferred the social aspects of the position and entertained and travelled frequently. He returned to the backbenches after the 1949 election and, in 1950 was appointed Lieutenant- Governor of Quebec by Governor General Harold Alexander, Earl Alexander of Tunis, on the advice of his prime minister, Louis St. Laurent. After his death in 1963, he was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

Climate Change While Zillman has contributed to the IPCC, unlike others on the IPCC, he has made public comments that indicate his respect for the IPCC process and has defended it from attack: : The IPCC is not, as... many appear to have been led to believe, some ideologically committed group of scientists with a particular position or perspective on the science which they seek to promote. Rather it is a highly transparent process, supervised by governments, which enables the contemporary state of knowledge of climate change as it emerges from the peer-reviewed published literature to be summarised and assessed by a representative group of the internationally acknowledged experts in the field with their summary assessment subject to one of the most exhaustive processes of peer review and revision that I believe has ever occurred in the international scientific community. The IPCC doesn't have a construct, a model, an ideology or a pre-determined position. It is simply an inter-governmentally coordinated scientific assessment mechanism for producing in summary form, for use by policymakers, a synthesis of the state of the science as it appears in the literature with particular attention to the identification of points on which there is a high level of scientific agreement in the literature and those on which there is little agreement or little confidence in what is agreed.John Zillman, Climate Change: A Natural Hazard?, 22 November 2004 Of current climate change he goes on to say: : I believe the models are now remarkably good at simulating most of the essential climate forming processes in the atmosphere and the ocean and even the behaviour of the total climate system at the global scale. And, though I would not have said so a decade ago, I now believe, as does the IPCC, that there is no more than a one in three chance that the observed global warming over the past century is entirely natural in origin. He has said of the IPCC Second Assessment Report: :In order to avoid the risk of having the IPCC reports made vulnerable to charges of political influence, the IPCC Chairman and the WG Co- chairmen were meticulous in insisting that the final decision on whether to accept particular review comments should reside with chapter Lead Authors. This was at variance with the normal role of journal editorial boards and led to suggestions that some Lead Authors ignored valid critical comments or failed to adequately reflect dissenting views when revising their text .

She is known for portraying the role of Gail Platt in the ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, a role that she has played since 1974. In 2014, she received the Outstanding Achievement Award at The British Soap Awards. Early life Cathryn Helen Wigglesworth was born to Alfred and Gladys Wigglesworth in Ossett and grew up in Morecambe, Lancashire. She was brought up in a middle-class family and attended private school. When she was eight her parents fostered Ghanaian-born Wilson Kpikpitse, who was sent to England as an overseas student at the age of eleven and remained with the family for eight years, but moved on following the death of Worth's mother, who was killed in a hit-and-run road accident while she was on a visit to Brighton. Worth's grandmother lived in Bradford and ran a boarding house for music hall performers, which prompted her desire to perform. She took dancing lessons from the age of three, and took part in many school theatrical productions. At the age of ten, she read stories on Granada Television's Scene at 6.30, and appeared in an episode of BBC's Z-Cars. At the age of twelve she played one of the von Trapp children in a stage production of The Sound of Music, at the Palace Theatre in London, a role that kept her in London for nine months. After this period, she returned to Morecambe to finish her education and later attended the Corona Theatre School in London.  Career  After graduating from drama school, Worth worked in repertory theatre, which included a year with the BBC Radio repertory company. She has had uncredited bit-parts in the films Oliver! (1968) and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969), and appeared on television in the Doctor Who story Colony in Space (1971), The Doctors, Helen: A Woman of Today (1973), Within These Walls (1974) and The Carnforth Practice (1974). She joined Coronation Street in 1974 and has remained with the soap since then. Worth stated she does not plan to leave Coronation Street, saying she's happy with Gail's never ending drama, and that it's a job she loves. In an interview with GMTV in January 2010, Worth said she loves Gail's storylines and praised the writers for giving her some great plots over the years, and which she hopes will continue. On 9 June 2014, a one-off special about Worth, Gail & Me, aired on ITV. The 30-minute documentary celebrated Worth's 40 years as Gail. =Awards= Worth has been honoured twice with the Outstanding Achievement Award\\" at awards ceremonies for her performance as Gail in Coronation Street. In September 2006, Worth won the \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" at the Inside Soap Awards. Then, on 25 May 2014, Worth won the \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" at The British Soap Awards 2014Profile, itv.com. Retrieved 9 April 2015. Worth received the British Soap Award for Scene of the Year in 2019 for a monologue she performed, which was also nominated for a BAFTA TV Award. Personal life Worth has a house in London. She married Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends narrator Michael Angelis in 1991. Worth forgave Angelis when he admitted to an affair in 1995, but they divorced in 2001 after he had another affair with model Jennifer Khalastchi. Following this, it was mistakenly reported by The Sun newspaper that Worth was dating London restaurant owner Simon Hopkinson. Worth married London music teacher Trevor Dawson on 6 April 2013. =Charity work= Worth is a patron of the Born Free Foundation, an international wildlife charity working throughout the world to stop individual wild animal suffering and protect threatened species in the wild. She appeared on television fronting campaigns and joined them at the House of Commons in 2006, to speak about the proposed changes to the Animal Welfare Bill and campaign for the retirement of Anne, the UK's last remaining circus elephant. She is a supporter of the charity ActionAid and has visited Sierra Leone in support of its work there.

The son of a poor Jewish family in London, he won a scholarship to the independent school Christ's Hospital and went on to the London School of Economics, graduating in 1952. After a short spell in a lowly job at the BBC selecting press cuttings for use in programmes, he secured a post as a junior member of the editorial staff of a weekly periodical, Truth, in 1953. Levin reviewed television for the Manchester Guardian and wrote a weekly political column in The Spectator noted for its irreverence and influence on modern parliamentary sketches. During the 1960s he wrote five columns a week for the Daily Mail on any subject that he chose. After a disagreement with the proprietor of the paper over attempted censorship of his column in 1970, Levin moved to The Times where, with one break of just over a year in 1981‚Äì82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both serious and comic. Levin became a well-known broadcaster, first on the weekly satirical television show That Was The Week That Was in the early 1960s, then as a panellist on a musical quiz, Face the Music, and finally in three series of travel programmes in the 1980s. He began to write books in the 1970s, publishing 17 between 1970 and 1998. From the early 1990s, Levin developed Alzheimer's disease, which eventually forced him to give up his regular column in 1997, and to stop writing altogether not long afterwards. Life and career =Early years= Levin was born on 19 August 1928 in London, the second child and only son of Philip Levin, a tailor of Jewish Bessarabian descent, and his wife, Rose, n√©e Racklin. Philip Levin abandoned the family and moved to South Africa when Levin was three. The two children were brought up with the help of their maternal grandparents, who had emigrated from Lithuania at the turn of the 20th century.Mooney, Bel, \\"Levin, (Henry) Bernard (1928‚Äì2004)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2008; online edition, January 2011, accessed 22 June 2011 Levin wrote of his childhood, \\"My home was not a religious one; my grandfather read the scriptures to himself silently and struggled through a little English; my grandmother, who could read no language at all, lit a candle on the appropriate days, as did my mother, though for her it was not really a religious sign. My uncles were quite secular ... and had hardly anything to do with the religion of their father and grandfathers\\".Levin, Bernard. \\"The Jews who choose\\", The Times, 6 October 1995 In The Guardian after Levin's death, Quentin Crewe wrote, \\"His illiterate grandparents' stories about life in Russia must have instilled in him the passionate belief in the freedom of the individual that lasted his whole life. In return, as he grew older, he used to read to them. Bernard could not read Hebrew, but he could get by in Yiddish\\".Crewe, Quentin. \\"Bernard Levin Obituary\\", The Guardian, 10 August 2004 Rose Levin was a capable cook, and, though the household was not well off, Levin was well fed and acquired an interest in food that in adult life became one of the regular themes of his journalism. The cuisine was traditional Jewish, with fried fish as one cornerstone of the repertoire, and chicken as another ‚Äì boiled, roast, or in soup with lokshen (noodles), kreplach or kneidlach.Levin (1985), pp. 203‚Äì205 As an adult Levin retained his love of Jewish cookery along with his passion for French haute cuisine.Levin (1985), p. 203 Christ's Hospital The Levin household was not especially musical, though it had a piano which Judith was taught to play; Rose Levin bought her son a violin and paid for lessons, convinced that he was \\"destined to be the next Kreisler or Heifetz\\".Levin (1983), p. 2 Levin persevered ineptly for two and a half years and then gave up with relief.Levin (1983), p. 4 The experience put him off music for some time, and it was only later that it became one of his passions, a frequent topic in his writing. Levin was a bright child and, encouraged by his mother, he worked hard enough to win a scholarship to the independent school Christ's Hospital in the countryside near Horsham, West Sussex.\\"Bernard Levin Obituary\\", The Times, 10 August 2004 His housemaster was D. S. (\\"Boom\\") Macnutt, the school's head of Classics. Macnutt was a strict, even bullying, teacher, and was feared rather than loved by his pupils, but Levin learned Classics well, and acquired a lifelong fondness for placing Latin tags and quotations in his writing. He battled on many fronts at Christ's Hospital: he was a Jew at a Church of England establishment; he was from a poor family; he was slight of stature; he was utterly indifferent to sport; he adopted a Marxist stance, hanging the Red Flag from a school window to celebrate the Labour victory in 1945.\\"Bernard Levin Obituary\\", The Daily Telegraph, 10 August 2004 In the local streets, the school's conspicuous uniform, including a cloak and tight stockings, attracted unwanted attention. Levin's biographer Bel Mooney writes of this period, \\"Jeers put iron in his soul\\". Among the consolations of Christ's Hospital was its thriving musical life. At concerts by the school orchestra (whose members included Levin's contemporary, Colin Davis), Levin listened seriously to music for the first time.Levin (1983), pp. 4‚Äì5 The food at the school was no such consolation; according to Levin it was so appalling that there must be something better to be found, and from his late teens he sought out the best restaurants he could afford.Levin (1985), p. 208 Levin's LSE tutors, Karl Popper (l.) and Harold Laski Levin hoped to go to the University of Cambridge, but, as his obituarist in The Times wrote, he \\"was not considered Oxbridge material\\". He was accepted by the London School of Economics (LSE), where he studied from 1948 to 1952. His talents were recognised and encouraged by LSE tutors including Karl Popper and Harold Laski; Levin's deep affection for both did not prevent his perfecting a comic impersonation of the latter.Hennessy, Peter. \\"Retirement recalls great days of LSE\\", The Times, 13 December 1977, p. 2 Levin became a skilled debater; he wrote for the student newspaper The Beaver, on a range of subjects, not least opera, which became one of his lifelong passions. Having graduated from the LSE in 1952, Levin worked briefly as a tour guide, and then joined the BBC's North American Service. His job was to read all the newspapers and weekly magazines, selecting articles that might be useful for broadcasting. =Journalism= In 1953, Levin applied for a job on the weekly periodical Truth. The paper had recently been taken over by the liberal publisher Ronald Staples who together with his new editor Vincent Evans was determined to cleanse it of its previous right-wing racist reputation.Levin, Bernard. \\"Now 'Truth' can be told about my early days\\", The Times, 24 June 1977, p. 14 Levin's noticeably Jewish surname, together with such skills as he had acquired in shorthand and typing, gained him immediate acceptance. He was offered the post of \\"general editorial dogsbody, which was exactly what I had been looking for\\". After a year, Evans left and was succeeded by his deputy, George Scott; Levin was promoted in Scott's place. He wrote for the paper under a variety of pseudonyms, including \\"A.E. Cherryman\\". While still at Truth, Levin was invited to write a column in The Manchester Guardian about ITV, Britain's first commercial television channel, launched in 1955. Mooney describes his television reviews as \\"notably punchy\\" and The Times wrote, \\"Levin took out his shotgun and let loose with both barrels\\". Levin gave the opening programmes a kindly review, but by the fourth day of commercial television he was beginning to baulk: \\"There has been nothing to get our teeth into apart from three different brands of cake-mix and a patent doughnut\\".Levin, Bernard. \\"Food for thought on lack of 'meat',\\" The Manchester Guardian, 26 September 1955, p. 14 Thereafter, he did not spare the network: \\"clich√© succeeded to clich√©\\";Levin, Bernard. \\"Sticky sentiment from Mr Winn\\", The Manchester Guardian, 7 October 1955, p. 5 \\"a mentally defective aborigine who was deaf in both ears would have little difficulty in leaving 'Double Your Money' ¬£32 richer than when he entered\\";Levin, Bernard. \\"ITV version of the $64 question\\", The Manchester Guardian, 29 October 1955, p. 5 and after the network's first hundred days he attributed its viewing figures to the \\"number of people who are sufficiently stupid to derive pleasure from such programmes\\".Levin, Bernard. \\"The first hundred days of ITV\\", The Manchester Guardian, 31 December 1955, p. 3 =The Spectator= In 1956, Levin found himself in irreconcilable disagreement with Truth's support of the Anglo- French military action in the Suez Crisis. The proprietor and editor of the long-established weekly The Spectator, Ian Gilmour, invited Levin to join his staff. Levin left Truth and became the political correspondent of The Spectator. He declared that he was no expert in politics, but Gilmour advised him, \\"review it as you would review television\\". Levin wrote his column under the pseudonym \\"Taper\\", from the name of a corrupt political insider in Disraeli's 1844 novel Coningsby. He followed Gilmour's advice, becoming, as The Guardian's Simon Hoggart said, \\"the father of the modern parliamentary sketch\\": Levin made no pretence of even-handedness. There were politicians he liked and politicians he did not like. For those in the latter category, \\"Taper's lacerations wounded\\". He invented unflattering nicknames; he wrote later, \\"I did not (though I wish I had) think of calling Sir Hartley Shawcross Sir Shortly Floorcross, but I did call Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller Sir Reginald Bullying-Manner\\".Levin (1980), p. 15 When the latter was elevated to the peerage as Lord Dilhorne, Levin renamed him Lord Stillborn.Fagan, Kieran. \\"Bernard Levin\\", The Sunday Independent, 15 August 2004 Taper was not Levin's only work for The Spectator. He wrote on a wide range of subjects, from a campaign for the release of three Arabs imprisoned by the British authorities, to supporting publication of the banned novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, and denunciation of the retired Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard. The last led to a secret meeting of more than 20 senior judges to see whether Levin could be prosecuted for criminal libel;Levin, Bernard. \\"Judgment on Lord Goddard\\", The Times, 8 June 1971, p. 12 there was no prosecution, and his accusations about Goddard's vindictiveness, deceit and bias have relatively recently been claimed to have been justified.Pannick, David. \\"Why Levin merits an honourable mention in our legal history\\", The Times, 7 September 2004 In 1959, Gilmour, while remaining as proprietor, stepped down as editor and was succeeded by his deputy, Brian Inglis; Levin took over from Inglis as assistant editor.\\"Brian Inglis Obituary\\", The Times, 13 February 1993 Later in that year, after the general election victory of another of his b√™tes noires, Harold Macmillan, Levin gave up the Taper column, professing himself to be in despair. Concurrently with his work at The Spectator, Levin was the drama critic of The Daily Express from 1959, offending many in theatrical circles by his outspoken verdicts.Leapmann, Michael.\\"Obituary: Bernard Levin ‚Äì Influential newspaper columnist and controversialist\\", The Independent, 10 August 2004 He modelled his reviewing style on that of Bernard Shaw's musical reviews of the late 19th century. He gave a fellow-critic an edition of Shaw's collected criticism, writing inside the cover, \\"'In the hope that when you come across the phrases I have already stolen you will keep quiet about it\\".Lewis, Peter. \\"That was the genius that was\\", The Daily Mail, 10 August 2004 Gilmour discouraged any hopes Levin might have had of succeeding Inglis as editor and in 1962, Levin left both The Spectator and The Daily Express, becoming drama critic of The Daily Mail. He remained there for eight years, and for the last five of them also wrote five columns a week on any subject of his choice. =Television and The Pendulum Years= Although by the early 1960s Levin was becoming a well- known name, his was not yet a well-known face. Meeting him in London the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis did not immediately recognise him: \\"He looks about sixteen, and at first I thought he was someone‚Äôs little boy brought along to see the fun ‚Äì very Jewish, with wavy fairish hair, very intelligent and agreeable to talk to\\".Hart-Davis, Letter of 29 October 1960 In 1963 Levin was invited to appear regularly on BBC television's new weekly late-night satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was, where he delivered monologues to camera about his pet hates and conducted interviews, appearing as \\"a tiny figure taking on assorted noisy giants in debate\\". The programme, which had a short but much-discussed run, was transmitted live; this added to its edginess and impact, but also made it prone to disruption. Levin was twice assaulted on air, once by the husband of an actress whose show Levin had reviewed severely, and once by a woman astrologer who squirted him with water. In 1966 BBC television screened a new musical quiz, Face the Music presented by Joseph Cooper. It ran intermittently until 1984.Follows, Stephen. \\"Cooper, Joseph Elliott Needham (1912‚Äì2001)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2005; online edition, January 2011, accessed 24 June 2011 Levin was a frequent panel member along with, among others, Robin Ray, Joyce Grenfell, David Attenborough and Richard Baker.\\"Obituary of Joseph Cooper\\", The Daily Telegraph, 6 August 2001, and Barker, Dennis. \\"Joseph Cooper\\", The Guardian, 9 August 2001 Lewis Carroll's the Walrus and the Carpenter (1871), borrowed by Levin as nicknames for Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson Levin published his first book in 1970. Called The Pendulum Years, its subtitle, Britain and the Sixties, summed up its subject. In 22 self-contained chapters, Levin considered various aspects of British life during the decade. Among his topics were prominent people including Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson ‚Äì dubbed the Walrus and the Carpenter by Levin ‚Äì and institutions such as the monarchy, the churches and the British Empire in its last days. Among the individual events examined in the book were the 1968 student riots and the prosecution for obscenity of the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover.Levin (1970), passim Levin's interest in indexes developed from his work on The Pendulum Years. He compiled his own index for the book, \\"and swore a mighty oath, when I had finished the task, that I would rather die, and in a particularly unpleasant manner, than do it again\\".Levin (1988), p. 181 He contrived to include in his index an obscene joke at the expense of the hapless prosecutor in the Chatterley trial, but found the difficulty of indexing so great that he became a champion of the Society of Indexers. He wrote several articles on the subject, and when reviewing books made a point of praising good indexes and condemning bad ones.Levin (1988), pp. 181‚Äì187 =The Times= In June 1970, during the general election campaign, Levin fell out with the proprietors of The Daily Mail, Lord Rothermere and his son Vere Harmsworth. Levin's contract guaranteed him absolute freedom to write whatever he chose, but Harmsworth, an unswerving Conservative, attempted to censor Levin's support for the other major party, Labour. Levin resigned, and immediately received offers from The Guardian and The Times to join them as a columnist. He found both tempting, and at one point \\"even had a wild notion of suggesting that I should write for both simultaneously\\".Levin (1980), p. 12 In the end, he chose The Times, giving as his reason that though the liberal Guardian was more in line with his own politics than the conservative Times, \\"I wrote more comfortably against the grain of the paper I worked for rather than with it\\".Levin (1980), p. 13 His obituarist in The Times adds that the decision may also have been swayed by the better remuneration offered by the paper. Among Levin's many topics ‚Äì top Eldridge Cleaver, Wagner; below Field Marshal Montgomery and a Death watch beetle Among the perquisites of the Times appointment were a company car and a large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely in touch with the daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.Levin (1980), pp. 95‚Äì95, 57‚Äì59, 210‚Äì216, 237‚Äì240, 101‚Äì107, 127‚Äì134, 118, 112‚Äì114, and 29‚Äì31 Within weeks of joining The Times Levin provoked a lawsuit and a strident controversy. The first was in March 1971, in an article titled \\"Profit and dishonour in Fleet Street\\", accusing Rothermere of underhand conduct and personal avarice during the merger of The Daily Mail and The Daily Sketch. The libel action brought by Rothermere was settled out of court, at substantial cost to the proprietor of The Times, Lord Thomson. Two months later, controversy followed Levin's renewed condemnation of Lord Goddard immediately after the latter's death in May 1971. The legal profession closed ranks and defended Goddard's reputation against Levin's attacks. Among those denouncing Levin were Lords Denning, Devlin, Hodson, Parker, Shawcross and Stow Hill.\\"Letters to the Editor\\", The Times, 9 June 1971, p. 15, 10 June 1971, p 15, 15 June 1971, p. 15, and 16 June 1971, p. 15 After Levin's death The Times published an article opining that information made public since 1971 \\"strongly supported\\" his criticisms of Goddard. At the time, the lawyers took revenge on Levin by ensuring that his candidacy for membership of the Garrick, a London club much favoured by lawyers and journalists, was blackballed. At The Daily Mail, Levin had generally been restricted to 600 words for his articles. At The Times he had more licence to spread himself. He appeared in The Guinness Book of Records for the longest sentence ever to appear in a newspaper ‚Äì 1,667 words. He was proud of this, and affected to be outraged when \\"some bugger in India wrote a sentence very considerably longer\\". He maintained that he could construct impromptu a sentence of up to 40 subordinate clauses \\"and many a native of these islands, speaking English as to the manner born, has followed me trustingly into the labyrinth only to perish miserably trying to find the way out\\".Quoted in Leapmann, Michael. \\"Obituary: Bernard Levin ‚Äì Influential newspaper columnist and controversialist\\", The Independent, 10 August 2004 Sometimes Levin wrote about frivolous, even farcical matters, such as a series of mock-indignant articles about the sex-lives of mosquitoes. At other times he wrote about matters of grave moral importance, unfailingly denouncing authoritarian regimes whether of the left or the right. He observed, \\"I am barred by the governments concerned from entering the Soviet Union and the lands of her empire on the one hand and South Africa on the other. These decrees constitute a pair of campaign medals that I wear with considerable pleasure and I have a profound suspicion of those who rebuke me for partisanship while wearing only one\\".Levin (1980), p. 16 He wrote regularly about the arts. Music was a recurrent theme; he was notorious for his addiction to Wagner, and other favourite composers included Schubert and Mozart. He wrote about performers he admired, including Otto Klemperer, Alfred Brendel, and Kiri Te Kanawa.Levin, Bernard. \\"A man burnt to his soul's bones\\", The Times, 25 January 1972, p. 14, \\"Music's sublime summit\\", The Times, 21 December 1987, and \\"Here at last, Strauss fit for the squeamish\\", The Times, 2 February 1985, p. 6 He turned less regularly to the visual arts, but when he did his views were clear-cut and trenchantly expressed. He wrote of a Pre-Raphaelite exhibition in 1984, \\"Never, in all my life, not even at the exclusively Millais exhibition in 1967, have I seen so much sickening rubbish in one place at one time\\".Levin, Bernard. \\"The barren Brotherhood\\", The Times, 7 May 1984, p. 12 His knowledge and love of literature were reflected in many of his writings; among his best- known pieces is a long paragraph about the influence of Shakespeare on everyday discourse. It begins: =Arianna Stassinopoulos (Huffington)= In 1971, Levin appeared in an edition of Face the Music along with a new panellist, Arianna Stassinopoulos (later known as Arianna Huffington).Stassinopoulos-Huffington, Arianna. \\"The Odd Couple\\", The Sunday Times, 15 August 2004 He was 42; she was 21. A relationship developed, of which she wrote after his death: \\"He wasn't just the big love of my life, he was a mentor as a writer and a role model as a thinker\\". Although Levin had rejected Judaism when a youth, he quested after spirituality. Such religious sympathies as he had, he said, were \\"with quietist faiths, like Buddhism, on the one hand, and with a straightforward message of salvation, like Christianity, on the other\\". With the help of Stassinopoulos he continued to search after spiritual truth. She later wrote, \\"He tried therapy, he tried Insight, a self-awareness seminar that I had helped to bring to London, he tried a stint in an ashram in India. Lesser souls would have avoided the ridicule that was heaped on him for his spiritual 'search' by simply keeping it to himself. But he didn't, because anything he was touched by he had to write about\\". In 1980 he wrote extensive accounts in his column about his visit to the Indian commune of the meditation teacher Osho. Levin was commissioned by the BBC to visit musical festivals around the world, broadcasting a series of talks about them.Levin (1983), p. vii Together with Stassinopoulos, he visited festivals in Britain, Ireland, continental Europe and Australia. He later wrote a book, Conducted Tour (1982) on the same subject. By the time it was published he and Stassinopoulos were no longer together. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin never wanted to marry or be a father. She concluded that she must break away, and moved to New York in 1980. =1980s= In 1981 Levin took a sabbatical from The Times after Rupert Murdoch bought the paper and Harold Evans succeeded Rees-Mogg as editor. Evans and Levin were friends,Levin (1985), p. 209 but Levin had publicly stated his preference that Charles Douglas-Home should be appointed. Within a year Evans and Murdoch fell out and Evans left in 1982; Douglas-Home became editor, and coaxed Levin back, to write two columns a week. On returning to the paper in October 1982, he began his column with the words, \\"And another thing\\".Levin, Bernard, \\"A noble dream, but I won't see it and nor will you\\", The Times, 22 October 1982, p. 12 This mirrored his opening gambit when publication of The Times resumed in 1979 after a printers' strike lasting nearly a year: his first column then had begun with the word \\"Moreover\\".Levin, Bernard, \\"Of cripplers, halt-bringers and working men\\", The Times, 13 November 1976, p. 16 By the 1980s Levin was sufficiently well known to be the subject of satire himself. The satirical ITV show Spitting Image caricatured him in high-flown discussion with another well-known intellectual in a sketch entitled \\"Bernard Levin and Jonathan Miller Talk Bollocks\\".Jackson, Lawrence. \\" Radio: Revamped Radio 4 takes flight with angels and insects\\", The Independent, 12 April 1998. The voice of the Levin figure was provided by Jon Glover and that of Miller by John Sessions. By now, Levin's political views were moving to the right, and he was no longer writing so much against the grain of his newspaper. He had come to admire Margaret Thatcher, though not the rest of her party: \\"But there is one, and only one, political position that, through all the years and all my changing views and feelings, has never altered, never come into question, never seemed too simple for a complex world. It is my profound and unwavering contempt for the Conservative Party\\".Levin, Bernard. \\"Sit down, gentlemen, and be counted\\", The Times, 19 March 1990 Levin never published an autobiography, but his book Enthusiasms, published in 1983, consists of chapters on his principal pleasures: books, pictures, cities, walking, Shakespeare, music, food and drink, and spiritual mystery.Levin (1985), passim The book is dedicated \\"To Arianna, with much more than enthusiasm\\" ‚Äì they remained loving friends for the rest of his life.Levin (1985), title page It contains a sentence that far outdoes his earlier 1,667 word effort in The Times, starting on page 212 and ending four pages later; it lists the restaurants most esteemed by Levin in Europe, Asia and America.Levin (1985), pp. 212‚Äì216 In the 1980s, Levin made three television series for Channel 4. The first, Hannibal's Footsteps, screened in 1985, showed Levin walking the presumed route taken by Hannibal when he invaded Italy in 218 BC.. The programme followed Levin's 320-mile journey from Aigues-Mortes to the crossing into Italy in the Queyras valley. He remained true to his declared intention of eschewing all forms of vehicular transport, and walked all the way, with the exception of his crossing the Rhone, rowing himself in a small boat.Levin (1987) pp. 42‚Äì43 He followed this with To the End of the Rhine in 1987, following the Rhine from its two sources, the Hinterrhein and the Vorderrhein, in Switzerland, to its estuary at Rotterdam, to the north. In between he joined the Swiss citizen army on manoeuvres, visited Liechtenstein bankers, zig-zagged the Swiss‚ÄìGerman border at Lake Constance, attended the Schubertiade at Hohenems and the opera at Bregenz, took the waters at Baden-Baden, visited the manufacturers of eau de Cologne, and paid tribute to Erasmus at Basle.Levin (1989), pp. 36, 52‚Äì55, 72‚Äì73, 76‚Äì79, 90‚Äì99, 143‚Äì146, 199‚Äì203 and 257‚Äì258 The last of the three series was in 1989, A Walk up Fifth Avenue in New York, from Washington Square to the Harlem River. In this series he encountered extremes of wealth and poverty, and met a wide variety of people, some famous (such as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Donald Trump) and some not (including a sword-swallowing unicyclist, and a bag lady in Central Park).Levin (1991), pp. 35, 178‚Äì180, 67‚Äì67 and 255‚Äì256 He wrote books based on each of the three series, published in 1985, 1987 and 1989 respectively. =Last years= Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Levin began to have difficulty with his balance as early as 1988, although Alzheimer's disease was not diagnosed until the early 1990s. From September 1995 his Times column appeared once weekly instead of twice, and in January 1997 the editor, Peter Stothard, concluded, despite a great admiration for Levin, that the weekly column should cease. Levin retired, though he continued to write for the paper occasionally over the next year. In his last decade, Levin's partner was the journalist Liz Anderson, who took care of him during the long degenerative phase of his illness. He died in Westminster, London, aged 75. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. A memorial service was held at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields at which Sir David Frost delivering the eulogy described Levin as \\"a faithful crusader for tolerance and against injustice who had declared, 'The pen is mightier than the sword ‚Äì and much easier to write with'\\".Grove, Valerie. \\"Levin: a life of wit and wisdom\\", The Times, 22 October 2004 Honours and commemorations Levin was appointed CBE for services to journalism in 1990.

Background The entry (in 1635) of France into the Thirty Years War had blocked off the overland \\"Spanish Road\\" to Flanders. To support the Spanish army of Flanders of Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, the Spanish navy had to ferry supplies by sea via Dunkirk, the last Spanish-controlled port on the North Sea coast. A Spanish fleet, under admiral Lope de Hoces y C√≥rdova, had managed to make the trip to Dunkirk in 1636 and again in 1637, without being spotted by Dutch squadrons. In 1638, the French invaded Spain, and laid siege to Fuentarrabia. Lope de Hoces was hurriedly dispatched to rescue the city, but his fleet was destroyed by the French navy under Henri de Sourdis while it lay at anchor near Getaria. As the remainder of the Spanish navy was engaged on missions in the Mediterranean and Brazil, there were not enough ships left to attempt the Dunkirk passage that year. In the spring of 1639, the Count-Duke of Olivares ordered the construction and assembly of a new fleet at A Coru√±a for a new relief jaunt to Dunkirk. 29 warships were assembled in four squadrons, soon joined by an additional 22 warships (also in four squadrons) from the Spanish Mediterranean fleet. Twelve English transport ships also arrived, contracted to carry the Spanish army under the flag of English neutrality. Lope de Hoces was offered overall command, but he turned it down. As a result, the command passed to Antonio de Oquendo, commander of the Mediterranean fleet. Oquendo was under instructions to assume a half-moon formation, to induce the Dutch into a boarding battle. The flagship was placed on the right wing (rather than the center), as that is where it was expected the Dutch firepower would come from. In a curious decision, ships of different squadrons were mixed through the formation, an attempt to ensure that the smaller ships would be supported by larger ones. The vanguard was to be composed of the seven-ship \\"Dunkirk squadron\\" commanded by Miguel de Horna, in light of their experience with the channel. The Dutch States-General made their own preparations. From intelligence networks, the Dutch learned that the Spanish fleet might attempt to make for the anchorage known as The Downs, off the English coast, between Dover and Deal. There they could anchor under protection of English neutrality and ferry the army and supplies on smaller, fast boats across the English Channel to Dunkirk. The States-General ordered a fleet of 23 warships and some fireships, under the overall command of Maarten Tromp, into the channel to prevent this eventuality, while the rest of the Dutch fleet was still being prepared. Tromp was under instructions to watch for and, if necessary, harass and delay the Spanish fleet, but was forbidden from engaging them in battle until the rest of the Dutch fleet, some fifty vessels under Johan Evertsen, had been launched and joined them. Setting out, Tromp divided his fleet into three squadrons. One squadron of fifteen ships, under rear admiral Joost Banckert, was dispatched to a position north of the Downs, in case the Spanish fleet had circumvented the British Isles and was coming from that side, and a second squadron of six ships under Witte de With was put inside the English Channel, on patrol by the English coast, while Tromp himself took the remaining 12 ships to patrol the French side of the channel. Opening phase The Spanish fleet of 75 ships and 24,000 soldiers and sailors set out on 27 August from A Coru√±a (in another calculation, 51 galleons, with the troops carried aboard 7 pataches and 12 English transports; on the whole, an estimated 8,000 sailors and 8,000 troops). The fleet reached the mouth of the English Channel on 11 September. On 15 September they learned from a passing English ship that a Dutch squadron was anchored near Calais. On the morning of 16 September the Spanish fleet spotted the 12-ship squadron of Maarten Tromp near the French coast. Tromp immediately dispatched one of his ships to warn Banckert, leaving him with only 11. De With's squadron were visible at a distance, but too late to reach Tromp. With odds of 57 against 11, Oquedo could probably have made for Dunkirk directly, and there would have been little Tromp could to do stop it. But Oquedo could not resist the chance to make battle with such favorable odds. Perhaps not realizing the size of the Spanish fleet, Tromp did not decline battle but rather ordered his squadron into a tight line of battle. Believing Tromp's squad was attempting to slip past his right wing, Oquendo impetuously ordered his flagship to turn hard to starboard, hoping to board Tromp's flagship. This maneouver, however, was effected without warning the rest of the Spanish fleet. Some of the ships near Oquendo turned with him, others were confused and maintained bearing. The half-moon formation quickly disintegrated, and only the Dunkirk squadron and the galleon San Juan kept up with the Spanish flagship's pursuit of Tromp. Had Oquendo given the order for a line, the immense Spanish fleet could have probably encircled and dispatched the Dutch squadron in a few hours. But Oquendo seemed intent on boarding the Dutch flagship. When he finally decided to turn for a shot, he did it too late and sailed past the Tromp's poop. Trying to correct his error, Oquendo attempted to board the second ship in the Dutch column. The latter also avoided him. Oquendo's flagship and one of the Dunkirk ships, the Santiago, were now downwind and on the receiving end of the cannonades of the remaining nine ships of the Dutch column. Tromp turned his column and went for another round on the Santiago. Oquendo, the other six Dunkirk ships and the San Juan, unable to turn upwind, fired as they could. The artillery did little damage, but Spanish musketry picked off many on the Dutch decks. This encounter lasted for three hours, in the course of which the Dutch ship Groot Christoffel accidentally exploded. By noon, the six ships of the Witte de With column had reached Tromp, and increased his number to 16. Although the rest of the Spanish fleet remained dispersed and disorganized, many units had finally turned and were also approaching from the other side. For Tromp, this was building up into a dangerous situation, as the Spanish units upwind would cut off his exit, and force the Dutch squadron to turn into the shoals of the bay of Boulogne and almost certainly run aground. But at this moment, Oquendo ordered the Spanish fleet to resume a half-moon formation. The Spanish ships turned, allowing Tromp's squadron to turn also, gain the wind, and escape the danger. There were no more engagements that evening. The fleets anchored in, and the next day, rear-admiral Joost Banckert arrived, bringing the total Dutch fleet to thirty-two. But there was no engagement, just preparations for what was to become known as the Action of 18 September 1639. The Spanish, whose priority was to protect the troops, not to endanger them by continuing the battle, were driven to take refuge off the coast of England, in the anchorage known as The Downs between Dover and Deal, near an English squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral John Pennington. They hoped the usual autumn storms would soon disperse the Dutch fleet. Tromp, as always, endured De With's insubordination with complacency. In a famous scene, described by De With himself, he entered Tromp's cabin after the battle with his face sooty, his clothes torn, and limping from a leg wound. Tromp looked up from his desk and asked: \\"Are you alright, De With?\\" De With replied: \\"What do you think? Would I have been if you had come to help me?\\" On the evening of the 28th, Tromp and De With withdrew to resupply, as they were short on gunpowder. They feared they had failed in their mission until they rediscovered the Spanish at the Downs on the 30th. Together, they blockaded the Spanish and sent urgently to the Netherlands for reinforcements. The five Dutch admiralties hired any large armed merchant ship they could find. Many joined voluntarily, hoping for a rich bounty. By the end of October, Tromp had 95 ships and 12 fire ships. Meanwhile, the Spanish, who earlier had managed to sneak 13 or 14 Dunkirker frigates through the blockade, began to transport their troops and money to Flanders on British ships under an English flag. Tromp stopped this by searching the English vessels and detaining any Spanish troops he found. Uneasy about the possible English reaction to this, he pretended to Pennington to be worried by his secret orders from the States- General. He showed him, \\"confidentially\\", a missive commanding him to attack the Spanish armada wherever it might be located and to prevent by force of arms any interference by a third power. Legend also says that Tromp formally asked de Oquendo why he refused battle though he had superior firepower. De Oquendo replied that his fleet had to be repaired first, but that he could not obtain masts and other materials now that the Dutch blockaded him. On learning this, Tromp supplied the Spanish with the necessary materials for repair. Nevertheless, they did not leave the English coast. The battle Before the Battle of the Downs by Reinier Nooms, circa 1639, depicting the Dutch blockade off the English coast, the vessel shown is the Aemilia, Tromp's flagship. On 31 October, an easterly wind giving him the weather gage, Tromp having dispatched 30 ships under De With to watch the English and prevent them from interfering,Tromp en de armada van 1639, p.114 kept two squadrons to the north (under Cornelis Jol) and the south (under Commodore Jan Hendriksz de Nijs) to block escape routes and attacked with three squadrons. Some of the large, unmanoeuverable Spanish ships panicked on approach of the Dutch fleet and grounded themselves deliberately; they were immediately plundered by the English populace, present in great numbers to watch the uncommon spectacle. Others tried a planned breakthrough. De Oquendo's Royal Flagship, the Santiago, came out first followed by the Santa Teresa, the Portuguese flagship. Five blazing fireships were sent into the Spanish ships. The first Spanish ship could disengage and avoid three of the fireships at the last moment, but these hit the following Santa Teresa, who had just managed to repel the attack of the other two. Too big (the biggest ship in the Spanish/Portuguese fleet) and slow to manoeuvre, and with no time to react, the Santa Teresa was finally grappled and set on fire by one fire ship. With Admiral Lope de Hoces already dead from his wounds, she fiercely burned with great loss of life. The Portuguese ships were intercepted by the squadron of the Zeelandic Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen who launched his fireships against them: most Portuguese ships were taken or destroyed, leaving according to some reports 15,200 dead and 1,800 prisoner. The number of dead is today considered as greatly exaggerated; for example, it does not take into account that a third of the troops had already reached Flanders. De Oquendo managed to escape in the fog with about ten ships, most of them Dunkirkers, and reach Dunkirk. Nine of the ships driven ashore during the battle could be later refloated and also reached Dunkirk.Ces√°reo Fern√°ndez Duro, Armada espa√±ola desde la uni√≥n de los reinos de Castilla y de Le√≥n, Est. tipogr√°fico Sucesores de Rivadeneyra, Madrid, 1898, Vol. IV, pp. 215-216 Losses According to the Spanish naval historian Ces√°reo Fern√°ndez Duro, of the 38 ships that attempted to break the Dutch blockade, twelve ran aground on the Downs (of which nine were refloated and managed to reach Dunkirk), one was burnt by a Dutch fireship, nine surrendered (of which three were so damaged that they sank on the way to port) and three ran aground on the coasts of France or Flanders to avoid capture.Fern√°ndez Duro, p. 221 The French diplomat Comte d'Estrades, in a letter to Cardinal Richelieu, claimed that the Spanish had lost thirteen ships burnt or sunk, sixteen captured with 4,000 prisoners, and lost fourteen off the coasts of France and Flanders,Comte d'Estrades, p. 45 a figure higher than the number of Spanish ships present at the Downs.Fern√°ndez Duro, p. 231 D'Estrades also reported in his letter that the Dutch had lost ten ships sunk or burnt. This source is cited by Jean Le Clerc in his Histoire des Provinces-Unies des Pays-Bas.Le Clerc, p. 194 The Portuguese Admiral and historian Ignacio Costa Quintella gives figures of 43 ships and 6,000 men lost by the Spanish and some ships and more than 1,000 men by the Dutch.Costa Quintanella, p. 353 The Dutch sources only mention the loss of one Dutch ship that got entangled with the Santa Teresa and about a hundred persons dead. Historian M.G de Boer's extensively researched book about the subject confirms this and puts Spanish losses in ships and men at about 40 and 7000Tromp en de armada van 1639, p.132 respectively. Aftermath The celebrated Dutch victory marked a significant moment in the shifting balance of naval power. Even if the Spanish mission was a failure, the larger part of the infantry troops managed to reach Flanders with all the money. Of the ships that succeeded in breaking through the blockade, many were severely damaged. Spain, straining under the vast commitments of the Thirty Years War, was in no position to rebuild its naval dominance. For instance, a 1637 convoy commanded by Lope de Hoces captured 32 enemy vessels in the Channel on its return voyage. Wilson, Peter H. A History of the Thirty Years' War Allan Lane (Penguin) 2009 p.651 Fighting over trade continued between Dutch and Dunkirker forces and the convoy itself was just one of a number; but these convoys paid a heavy price in lives and ships in running the Dutch blockades. These complicated operations in the Low Countries had left the overall Spanish Habsburg forces and finances in a precarious situation.p. Wilson, Peter H. A History of the Thirty Years' War Allan Lane (Penguin) 2009 p.651 The Dutch, English and French were quick to take advantage by seizing some small Spanish island possessions in the Caribbean. But by far the worst effects for Spain were the increased difficulties it suffered in maintaining its position in the Southern Netherlands. Tromp was hailed as a hero on his return and was rewarded with 10,000 guldens, invoking the jealousy of De With who only got 1,000. De With wrote some anonymous pamphlets painting Tromp as avaricious and himself as the real hero of the battle. With Spain gradually losing its dominant naval position, England weak, and France not yet in possession of a strong navy, the Dutch allowed their own navy to diminish greatly after a peace treaty was signed in 1648. So, with an ineffective naval administration and ships that were too light and too few in number, they were to find themselves at a serious disadvantage in their coming struggles with the English. However, they were able to maintain their large mercantile advantage over the English, entering into a period of increasing Dutch maritime superiority, both mercantile and naval, from the Second Anglo- Dutch War, until the onset of the 18th century.

Life  Anderson was born from a Baltic German family in Minsk (now in Belarus), but in 1894 moved to Kazan (Russia), where his father, Nikolai Anderson (1845-1905), had been appointed as professor for Finno-Ugric languages at the University of Kazan. Anderson's younger brother was the well known mathematician and economist Oskar Anderson (1887-1960), and his older brother was the astrophysicist Wilhelm Anderson (1880-1940). The turmoil created by the Russian Revolution prompted Anderson and his brother Wilhelm to leave Russia and to move to Tartu in Estonia. While living in Estonia in 1939, Anderson, like the majority of Baltic Germans living there, was resettled to Germany. In 1962 he died after having been involved in a traffic accident.  Career  In 1904, Anderson enrolled at the University of Kazan and from 1909 continued his studies in Saint Petersburg, where he received a Magister degree from the University of Saint Petersburg in 1911. During his time in Saint Petersburg he also catalogued the folk tales held in the archives of the Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences and the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. For the 1911/1912 winter semester he enrolled at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University in Berlin, returning to the Kazan to continue his studies in the autumn of 1912. In 1916 he submitted his thesis on the ballad of the Emperor and the Abbot (AT 922) for which he received a Doctorate from the University of Kazan in 1918. He worked at the University of Tartu in Estonia between 1920 and 1939, where in 1920 he was made the first holder of a chair of folklore. Anderson's most significant students at the time were Oskar Loorits and and later Isidor Levin. From 1920 he was a member of the Learned Estonian Society (Gelehrte Estnische Gesellschaft), Estonia's oldest scholarly organization, and from 1928 to 1929 he was the president of the society. In 1930 he, like his father Nikolai Anderson before him, was made an honorary member of the society. He also held honorary membership of the American Folklore Society and the . In 1936 Anderson became a corresponding member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In addition to this he was a corresponding member of the Royal Gustavus Adolphus Academy, the Finnish Literature Society, the Finno-Ugrian Society and the Warsaw Scientific Society. From 1940 to 1945 he worked at the University of K√∂nigsberg. After the end of the second world war he received a visiting professorship at the University of Kiel, which he held until his retirement. A notable student he mentored at Kiel was W. F. H. Nicolaisen who had a distinguished career in folklore studies in the United States and Scotland. In 1950 Anderson was invited to the US to take part in a meeting of the International Folk Music Council held in Bloomington, Indiana, after which he stayed at Indiana University Bloomington for a few months as a visiting scholar. He retired in 1953 but remained affiliated with the University of Kiel as emeritus professor until his death.  Work  Walter Anderson was one of the driving forces behind the comparative geographic-historical Method of folkloristics. He is best known for his monograph Kaiser und Abt (Folklore Fellows' Communications 42, Helsinki 1923) on folktales of type AT 922. Anderson also had a keen interest in numismatics, and he published several articles in this field. Some of his contributions to the study of Islamic coins are considered to have been groundbreaking. For some time between 1920 and 1939 he also served as conservator for the coin collection of the Learned Estonian Society.  Honours and awards  Anderson was awarded the Estonian Order of the White Star (3rd class) in 1938.

His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.  Biography  Born in Courbevoie in western Paris to a wealthy family, Lartigue started taking photographs when he was seven. He photographed his friends and family at play ‚Äì running and jumping; racing home-built race cars; making kites, gliders as well as aeroplanes; and climbing the Eiffel Tower. He was one of the first artists to use the Kodak Brownie camera for snapshots. He also photographed sport events, such as the Coupe Gordon Bennett and the French Grand Prix, early flights of aviation pioneers such as Gabriel Voisin, Louis Bl√©riot, Hubert Latham, Louis Paulhan and Roland Garros. He also captured in his camera, tennis players such as Suzanne Lenglen at the French Open tennis championships. Many of his initial, famous photographs were originally captured through stereo, but he also produced a vast number of images in all formats and media including glass plates in various sizes, autochromes, and film. He developed his own photographs from a young age. While he sold a few photographs to sporting magazines such as La Vie au Grand Air, in middle age he concentrated on painting which also was his source of income and living. However, he continued taking photographs and maintained written journals about them throughout his life. At age of 69 his boyhood photographs were 'discovered' by Charles Rado of the Rapho agency who introduced Lartigue to John Szarkowski, curator of the Museum of Modern Art, who arranged an exhibition of his work at the museum. Life magazine published the photos in 1963. This exhibition gained him fame and exposure to the industry. He then got opportunities to work with several fashion magazines and became famous in other countries as well. In 1974, he was commissioned by the newly elected President of France Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing to shoot his official portrait. The result was a simple photo, simply lit, using the national flag as a background. He was rewarded with his first French retrospective at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs the following year, which paved the way for more commissions from fashion and decoration magazines. Although best known as a photographer, Lartigue was also a good painter. He often showed up in the official salons in Paris and in the south of France from 1922. He was friends with a wide selection of literary and artistic celebrities including the playwright Sacha Guitry, the singer Yvonne Printemps, the painters Kees van Dongen, Pablo Picasso and the artist-playwright-filmmaker Jean Cocteau. He also worked on the sets of the film-makers Jacques Feyder, Abel Gance, Robert Bresson, Fran√ßois Truffaut and Federico Fellini, and many of these celebrities became the subject of his photographs. Lartigue, however, photographed everyone he came in contact with. His most frequent muses were his three wives, and his mistress of the early 1930s, the Romanian model Ren√©e Perle. His first book, Diary of a Century was published in collaboration with Richard Avedon. The book was mentioned at the Rencontres d'Arles Book Award in 1971. The next year he was elected as the festival's guest of honor. He continued taking photographs throughout the last three decades of his life, finally achieving commercial success. An evening screening was presented by Michel Tournier: \\"Jacques-Henri Lartigue & Jeanloup Sieff.\\" In 1974, his work was included in the group exhibition \\"Filleuls et parrains.\\" In 1984, the movie \\"Lartigue, ann√©e 90,\\" by Fran√ßois Reichenbach was released. At the same time his work \\"Les 6 x 13 de Jacques-Henri Lartigue\\" was exhibited in the festival. One of the evenings screening was \\"J.-H. Lartigue, l'amateur de r√™ve\\" by Patrick Roegiers, in 1994, and a last exhibition was presented: \\"Lartigue a cent ans.\\"  Award  * 1984: The Cultural Award from the German Society for Photography (DGPh)\\"The Cultural Award of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Photographie (DGPh)\\".

Legacy  His son Dany Lartigue, a painter and a noted entomologist specializing in butterflies, is patron of La Maison des Papillons, a small museum on a very narrow street in St. Tropez containing paintings and souvenirs of his father and a large artistically presented collection of butterflies. American director Wes Anderson is a fan of Lartigue's work, and has referenced it in his films. A shot in Rushmore is based on one of his photographs, and Lartigue's likeness was the basis for the portrait of Lord Mandrake in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. A station on the T2 tram line in Issy-les-Moulineaux in southwestern Paris is named after Lartigue, adjacent to a street also named after him.  References   Further reading  * Lartigue, J.-H.

Early life Born in Renton, Scotland, Glen graduated in law from the University of Glasgow before immigrating to Canada in 1911 where he settled in Winnipeg. He later moved to Russell, Manitoba, where he practised law and was elected to the school board. Politics A supporter of the Progressive Party in Manitoba, Glen had been the chief organizer for party leader Thomas Crerar in the 1917 federal election when Crerar was a Liberal-Unionist candidate, and the 1921 election in which the Progressives made their debut. Glen was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1926 election as a Liberal- Progressive at a time when Manitoba Progressives, including the Manitoba Progressive Party provincial government, had decided to align with the Liberals in order to increase their influence. He lost his seat in the 1930 election, but re-elected to Parliament in the federal election of 1935. Glen was chosen as Speaker of the House following the 1940 election, and had to deal with issues of wartime security such as censoring Hansard in order to remove sensitive military information. Due to the international situation and wartime mobilization, there was a greater degree of interparty cooperation during the war which assisted Glen in his role as Speaker. Glen remained a Liberal-Progressive in name until the 1945 election when he ran as a Liberal‚Äîimmediately prior to the 1945 election, Mackenzie King appointed Glen to the Canadian Cabinet as Minister of Mines and Resources. In practice, however, he and his fellow Liberal-Progressives were Liberals in every respect. Glen remained Minister of Mines and Resources until he retired from Cabinet following a heart attack in 1948. A few months later Glen resigned from the House of Commons in order to provide a seat for Stuart Garson, the Premier of Manitoba who had been enticed to join the federal Cabinet as Minister of Justice. Glen was appointed Canadian Co-Chairman of the International Joint Commission. He died two years later.

However, team ownership could not secure funding for a stadium and the franchise application was withdrawn 13 months after it had been submitted. The Atlantic Schooners name was revived in 2018 as the name of a proposed CFL expansion team. Franchise history On May 13, 1982, Maritime Professional Football Club Ltd. was granted a conditional expansion franchise by the Canadian Football League's board of governors with unanimous approval. The team was to pay a $1.5 million expansion fee by May 1, 1983 and could begin play in 1984 if a suitable 30,000 seat stadium were built in time for the league opener that year. The ownership group was led by John Donoval, a Mississauga, Ontario truck executive, and J. I. Albrecht, former general manager of the Montreal Alouettes. Even before the franchise was officially awarded, Albrecht, who was working as a football consultant for Donoval, planned to hire Acadia Axemen head coach John Huard as the Schooners' first head coach. As expected, Huard was named as head coach on the same day that the franchise was awarded. Nova Scotia industrialist, Robert Burns Cameron joined the ownership group on August 30, 1982 and was reported to have invested over 50% into the group. On November 3, 1982, the team name Atlantic Schooners was officially announced by Albrecht at a press conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was selected based on a study followed by a name-the- team contest in which \\"schooner\\" was the winning selection. Other names that were considered by Donoval were Atlantic Windjammers and Atlantic Storm. The goal was to have a regional team that would represent all of Atlantic Canada. The logo was a stylized \\"A\\" in the shape of a schooner that rode on four waves, representing the four Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland.Football fans remain loyal to Atlantic Schooners The team colours were silver, maritime blue, nautical brass, and white. An expansion draft was planned to be held following the 1983 CFL season where, initially, a maximum of 38 players from the existing nine member clubs would be used to form a roster. The actual formula was approved on November 24, 1982 by the CFL governors. Each of the nine existing clubs would be able to protect 10 imports and 10 non-imports from their final rosters from the 1983 season. The Schooners would then select two imports and two non-imports from each team for a maximum of 36 players. Each team could only protect one quarterback and the Schooners could draft a maximum of two in total. The draft would have taken place in January 1984. The Schooners proposed home was a 34,000-seat stadium located on leased land in the city of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, said to be built at a cost of $6 million. When the franchise was awarded, it was still being debated between the mayors of Halifax and Dartmouth where the new stadium should be built as both wanted the team in their respective cities. However, neither the provincial or federal government were willing to contribute to the funding of the stadium. As described by senator Ray Perrault, minister of state for fitness and amateur sport, federal funds were only made available when a city was hosting an international event, such as the Olympic Games or Commonwealth Games. The Premier of Nova Scotia, John Buchanan, also stated that no provincial funding would be made available in any circumstance. The ownership group had purchased a scoreboard from the New England Patriots' Sullivan Stadium for use in their new stadium. Ultimately, the Schooners were unable to meet the deadlines set by the league, including the deadline for a financing plan for the new stadium. On June 16, 1983, Maritime Professional Football Club Ltd. withdrew their application for a franchise and refunded season ticket deposits. The ownership group's withdrawal came one day before the league deadline because Donoval believed that a withdrawal rather than league rejection would make re-applying for a franchise easier. However, another franchise application never came to fruition.

Every year on the Feast of Corpus Christi, the village celebrates the traditional Antlassritt. It is also the birthplace of Matth√§us Hetzenauer, an Austrian sniper in the 3rd Mountain Division on the Eastern Front of the World War II, who was credited with 345 kills.  Geography  = Location = Brixen im Thale lies in Kitzb√ºhel District about 10 km west of the district town of Kitzb√ºhel at the head of the Brixental at 794 m above sea level, nestling amongst the grass-covered mountains of the Kitzb√ºhel Alps. The highest mountain in the municipality is the Fleiding at 1,892 metres above the Adriatic. North of the village rises the mountain ridge of the Hohe Salve. South of the village are the Nachts√∂llberg and the Gaisberg, separated by the valley of the Brixenbach. The slopes north of the municipality (known as Sonnberg or Sonseitn - sunny side) are mainly used for farming and only sparsely covered in conifers. The slopes south of the village (referred to as Schattseitn - shadow side) are covered by spruce forest, apart from a few alpine meadows. = Municipal divisions = Brixen im Thale consists of the following villages and sub-districts: Achenberg, Brixen-Zentrum, Buchberg, Buchschwent, Feuring, Griesberg, Hof, Lauterbach, Maria-Luisenbad, Ritschberg, Salvenberg, Sch√∂n, Sonnberg, Vordermoosen und Winkl.  Village development  New village square From 2009 to 2010 the village square in front of the community hall was thoroughly renovated and extended. The cobblestones were replaced and the square enlarged and raised. The fountain was moved to a new site, next to the beech tree, which had to stay where it was. Red and white bricks were used for the cobbles. Seating was built around the fountain and for the bus stop. The road was renewed from the Brixner H√∂he/Aschaber to the Brixnerwirt, with the aim of slowing traffic down through the village centre. Since the ring road was built, quality of life in the village has improved considerably. In the last four years, large homes have been built, especially for local people. The parish encourages newcomers and especially the growth of the economy. in the future other land for building will be made available in the south of the area so that the actual village centre can come more into its own.  History  Brixen im Thale has a long and varied history. The Celts first settled the valley and built small villages here as evinced by archaeological finds of axes and swords, as well as an urn cemetery. The name Brixen im Thale appears to be Celtic in origin and indicates that there has always been a settlement here. In the 3rd century A.D., there was a kind of temple, built by the Romans, on the site of the present church. In 788 A.D., the name Indiculus Arnonis, which means \\"a church with own fields\\", was given to the church by Bishop Arno. At that time, it was the only church in the Brixental. It is therefore the oldest parish in the Tyrolean Unterland along with those in of St. Johann in Tirol, Ebbs, S√∂ll, Radfeld and St. Ulrich am Pillersee. In 1481, a library (the Taz Library) was founded by Wilhelm Taz, who was a teacher and a priest, in Brixen im Thale. It still exists today. Around 1600, copper was mined; but mining ceased at the end of the 18th century. On Corpus Christi, the traditional Antlassritt takes place. This is a eucharistic procession by farmers from the towns of Kirchberg in Tirol, Brixen im Thale and Westendorf (Tirol). The Antlassritt commemorates the 30 Years' War in the 17th century, when the villagers of those communities beat back Swedish troops on the Klausenbach river. The farmers' ride to the Klausenkapelle chapel in Kirchberg in Tirol commemorates their victory.

Some scholars consider it to have developed from the earlier Strigolniki religious concept that also had developed in Novgorod in the 14th century. Initially popular among high-ranking statesmen and even the royal court, the concept was persecuted by hegumen Joseph Volotsky and Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod. Terminology and beliefs The term Zhidovstvuyushchiye (), as it is known in the sources, is derived from the Russian word –∂–∏–¥ (zhid, from Judea, an older Russian term for Jew which is now considered pejorative).Immonen, Visa. \\"The stratigraphy of a life: An archaeological dialogue with Leo Klejn.\\" Archaeological Dialogues (2003), 10: 57-75, Cambridge University Press. For more on the origins of the word see Henrik Birnbaum. Essays in Early Slavic Civilization/Studien zur Fruhkultur der Slaven W. Fink, 1981. pp 26-36. Zhidovstvuyuschiye may be loosely translated as \\"those who follow Jewish traditions\\" or \\"those who think like Jews\\". Hegumen Joseph Volotsky, the main critic and persecutor of this thought, considered the founder of this religious movement to be a certain Skhariya (a.k.a. Zakhariya, Skara; Russian: –°—Ö–∞—Ä–∏—è, –ó–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–∏—è, –°–∫–∞—Ä–∞). This was Zacharia ben Aharon ha-Cohen, a scholar from Kiev brought to Novgorod by Mikhailo Olelkovich from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1470. Zacharia translated a number of Hebrew texts on astronomy, logic and philosophy.Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, p290 Their nickname arbitrarily presupposed their adherence to \\"Judaism\\", even though most of Skhariya's followers had been ordinary Russians of Russian Orthodox faith and low-ranking Orthodox clergy and had never confessed Judaism. Almost all we know about their religious beliefs is found in accounts left by their accusers. This makes it rather difficult to determine the exact beliefs of the adherents, since the aim of the accusers was to blacken the name of the \\"sect\\" and crush it. According to most accounts though, the Belief of Skhariya renounced the Holy Trinity and the divine status of Jesus, monasticism, ecclesiastic hierarchy, ceremonies, and immortality of soul. Some adherents also professed iconoclasm. The adherents also promoted the idea of \\"self-authority\\", or the self- determination of each individual in matters of faith and salvation. Priests Denis and Aleksei were considered ideologists of this heretical movement. History In the late 15th and early 16th century, this religious movement spread over Moscow. In 1480, even Grand Prince Ivan III himself invited a few prominent adherents to visit the city. The Grand Prince's behavior could be explained by the fact that he had sympathized with ideas of secularization and the struggle against feudal division. Thus, the Skhariyans enjoyed the support of some high-ranking officials, statesmen, merchants, Yelena Stefanovna (wife of Ivan the Young, heir to the throne) and Ivan's favorite deacon and diplomat Feodor Kuritsyn. The latter even decided to establish his own club in the mid-1480s. Despite the growing popularity of this religious movement in Novgorod and Moscow, Ivan III was wary of the fact that it could irreversibly infiltrate broader masses of ordinary people and deprive him of ecclesiastic support in his foreign policy. Indeed, a denial of the Trinity and the divinity of Christ would destroy Christianity, while the adherents' opposition to the clergy and the secular authorities would have undermined the entire society. This made Ivan III renounce his ideas of secularization and ally with the clergy.On Ivan's policies regarding the sect, see George Vernadsky, \\"The Heresy of the Judaizers and the Policies of Ivan III of Moscow\\", Speculum, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Oct., 1933): 436-454. =Persecution= The struggle against the adherents was led by hegumen Joseph Volotsky and his followers (–∏–æ—Å–∏—Ñ–ª—è–Ω–µ, iosiflyane or Josephinians) and Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod.John I.

After uncovering adherents in Novgorod around 1487,Vernadsky, The Heresy of the Judaizers and the Policies of Ivan III, 439. Gennady wrote a series of letters to other churchmen over several years calling on them to convene sobors (\\"church councils\\") with the aim \\"not to debate them, but to burn them.\\" Such councils were held in 1488, 1490, 1494 and 1504. The councils outlawed religious and non-religious books and initiated their burning, sentenced a number of people to death, sent adherents into exile, and excommunicated them. In 1491, Skhariya the Jew was executed in Novgorod by the order of Ivan III. More adherents were executed with Gennady's approval, including archimandrite Kassian of the Iuriev Monastery (who had allowed a number of adherents to hide there), Nekras Rukavov (they first tore out his tongue and then burnt him at the stake), a Pskovian monk Zakhar and others.E. E. Golubinskii, Istoriia Russkoi Tserkvi (Moscow: University Typography, 1900), vol. 2, pt. 1, p. 582. By the end of the 15th century, some of the adherents remained under the protection of Yelena Stefanovna and her son tsarevich Dmitry (grandson of Ivan III). However, in 1502 Dmitry was stripped of his title (transferred to Vasili III - son of Ivan III and Sophia Paleologue). As soon as Ivan III died in 1505, Yelena and Dmitry were arrested and imprisoned, leaving the adherents vulnerable to attacks from the authorities. In 1504, diak (secretary) Ivan- Volk Kuritsyn, Dmitry Konoplev and Ivan Maksimov were burnt at the stake.Golubinskii, Ist. Russk. Tserk, vol. 2, pt. 1, p. 582 Other adherents were banished, imprisoned, or excommunicated. Feodor Kuritsyn's adherents' club ceased to exist. 19th-century groups In the early 19th century, a number of communities appeared in Tula, Voronezh and Tambov, which followed Jewish traditions and halacha. They were also called zhidovstvuyuschiye and were persecuted severely in the times of Nicolas I. Since the beginning of the 20th century, they have been also called iudeystvuyuschie, from iudeystvo, a neutral term for the Jewish religion. Now they are generally considered a part of Jewish people (although with no real Israelite descent) and some of them have immigrated to Israel. These groups, however, are not linked to the teaching of Skhariya.

Because Polish adjectives have different forms for the genders, Koniecpolska is the form for a female family member. History The Koniecpolski was a magnate family. The family appears in the historical annals beginning in the 15th century. The family originated from the village Stary Koniecpol 40 km east of Czƒôstochowa, currently in the Silesian Voivodeship. Their family name derives from that place's name. One of its first representatives was voivode of Sieradz Jakub Koniecpolski who participated in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, considered the biggest battle in medieval history. In 1443 the Koniecpolski family founded the city-fortress Koniecpol, which became the seat of the family. In the 16th century the family lineage split into two branches the \\"Hetman branch\\" and the \\"Castellan branch\\". In the 17th century the family acquired great political authority, and became owners of huge landed estates. The most representative of the \\"Hetman branch\\" was Field and Grand Crown Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski one of the greatest commanders of the 17th century. Stanislaw begun in 1643 the present-day construction of the Presidential Palace in Warsaw. He also ordered the reconstructing and strengthening of the Bar castle.

Born in Portland, Oregon, Smithson was a student of theology from Oregon State University and an AAU champion in 1907 and 1909 in the hurdles. At London, the main favourites were Smithson's teammates John Garrels and Arthur Shaw who had earlier equaled Alvin Kraenzlein's world record of 15.2 seconds. The 110 m hurdles was not contested on a track as usual, but in a special path in the stadium grass. Only Americans reached the final, which was contested on the last day of the London Games. Smithson defeated Garrels and set a new world record of 15.0 seconds. Forrest Smithson died in Contra Costa County, California, aged 78. Bible story There is a widespread story about Smithson winning the gold medal while carrying a Bible in his left hand (ostensibly to protest against the decision to run the 110 m hurdles final on a Sunday). At first, none of the 110 m hurdles heats nor the final were scheduled or planned to take place on Sunday. The story was not mentioned in the newspapers. This story is based on a picture published in the official report, which was taken during the final. The fact was that Forrest Smithson was a strong Christian and often ran with a Bible in his hand to point people to the source of his strength and inspiration; his relationship with Jesus Christ.

Today, the term is used to distinguish early settlers of Texas, especially those who supported the Texas Revolution. Mexican settlers of that era are referred to as Tejanos, and residents of modern Texas are known as Texans. History =Colonial settlement= Many different immigrant groups came to Texas over the centuries. There was Spanish immigration in the 17th century, French and English in the 18th century, and massive German, Dutch, Swedish, Irish, Scottish, Scots-Irish, and Welsh immigration in the years leading up to Texas independence in the 19th century. Thus, the word Texian is not specific to white immigrants or English-speaking immigrants that settled the land. So, before Texas became a sovereign nation in 1836, Texian referred to any resident, of any color or language. In 18341836, the Texian Army was organized for the Texas Revolution of independence from Mexico, a nation which had won its independence from Spain a dozen or so years earlier. The Texian Army was a diverse group of people from many different nations and states. The Texian Army was composed of native Tejano volunteers, volunteers from the Southern United States; and people from England, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Portugal, and what is now the Czech Republic. Used in this sense, terms like \\"Texian Army\\", \\"Texian forces\\", or \\"Texian troops\\" would refer to any of the inhabitants of Texas, in that era, who participated in the Texas Revolution. =Texians of the Republic of Texas, 1836 to 1846= Texian was a popular demonym, used by Texas colonists, for all the people of the Republic of Texas, before it became a U.S. state. This term was used by early colonists and public officials, including many Texas residents, and President Mirabeau Lamar frequently used it to foster Texas nationalism. Over time, the English-speaking Americans in Texas began to champion the usage of \\"Texan\\" instead of \\"Texian\\". Overwhelming numbers in the United States used the term Texan; and due to the massive 19th-century influx of Americans into the Republic/U.S. state of Texas, Texan became the standard term after 1850. The Texas Almanac of 1857 bemoaned the shift in usage, saying \\"Texian...has more euphony, and is better adapted to the conscience of poets who shall hereafter celebrate our deeds in sonorous strains than the harsh, abrupt, ungainly, appellation, Texan‚Äîimpossible to rhyme with anything but the merest doggerel.\\" The Almanac continued to use the earlier term until 1868. Indeed, many who had lived through the times of Revolution and Republic continued to call themselves Texians into the 20th century.

The company is a direct reinsurer and is represented in all major reinsurance markets worldwide through a network of more than 40 offices and over 3,578 employees. Gen Re is a member of the Berkshire Hathaway Inc group of companies. Financial strength ratings of Gen Re's reinsurance operations: * A.M. Best: A++ (Superior) * Standard & Poor's Claims Paying Ability Rating: AA+ General Re Corporation is the holding company for Gen Re's global reinsurance and related operations. It owns General Reinsurance Corporation, General Re Life Corporation and General Reinsurance AG, the direct reinsurers which conduct business as Gen Re. In addition, the insurance, reinsurance and investment management companies in the General Re group include: Gen Re Intermediaries, GR-NEAM, General Star, Genesis, USAU and Faraday. History General Reinsurance Corporation‚Äôs history began in 1921 as the General Casualty and Surety Reinsurance Corporation, before it took over the U.S. business of the Norwegian Globe Insurance Company of Christiania, Norway. In 1923, American investors acquired the company and changed the name to General Reinsurance Corporation. In 1928, the General Alliance Corporation was organized to acquire and hold the shares of General Reinsurance Corporation, as well as a half interest in the holdings of the Royal Exchange Assurance Group (London) in the United British Insurance Co., Ltd. In 1929, the General Alliance Corporation owned all the stock of General Reinsurance Corporation, and jointly with the Royal Exchange Group, a controlling interest in the United British. The United British Insurance Co., Ltd. established a U.S. branch that transacted casualty reinsurance as a \\"running mate for the General, and has the same management as the General. The two companies transact practically all forms of casualty and surety reinsurance and constitute the first example of a 'Group' in the history of American casualty reinsurance.\\" Also in 1929, General Reinsurance affirmed that it would be only a direct reinsurer. In 1945, General Reinsurance merged with Mellon Indemnity Corporation. In 1954, the company created the first professional casualty facultative reinsurance department. Property facultative followed, beginning in 1956. North America branch offices were opened during this time. In the 1950s, General Reinsurance began writing reinsurance internationally, expanding in this area during the 1960s and 1970s. The company continued to grow through the next two decades, opening more U.S. and Canada branch offices and making various acquisitions. The company moved its headquarters from New York City to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1974, and then to Stamford, Connecticut in 1984. In 1980, General Re Corporation, the parent holding company, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1994, General Reinsurance Corporation formed an alliance with what was then Cologne Re (K√∂lnische R√ºckversicherungs-Gesellschaft, which was founded in 1846), now General Reinsurance AG. In 1998, General Re Corporation was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and in 2003 General Reinsurance Corporation and Cologne Re began marketing under the brand name of Gen Re. In 2009, General Reinsurance Corporation completed its purchase of Cologne Re, whose name was changed to General Reinsurance AG in 2010. The company continues to market globally as Gen Re. =AIG Securities Fraud= In October 2000, some Wall Street analysts questioned the decline in American International Group (AIG) loss reserves. In an effort to quell these concerns, AIG entered into two sham reinsurance transactions with Cologne Re Dublin, a subsidiary of General Reinsurance, that had no economic substance but were designed to add $500 million in phony loss reserves to AIG‚Äôs balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2000 and first quarter of 2001. In 2005, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer began an investigation into the two reinsurance transactions. Soon afterwards, AIG came under market pressure, and admitted it had undertaken what could be construed as securities fraud. The staff admitted that the two reinsurance transactions had inflated AIG‚Äôs balance sheet and propped up AIG‚Äôs stock price. In the resultant stock crash, investors lost $500 million in investments. Cologne Re Dublin's CEO, John Houldsworth, agreed to turn state's witness for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission, in agreement for a plea bargain. Houldsworth then pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud, resultantly facing a sentence of up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. The final sentencing was placed on hold, subject to consequential SEC prosecutions. The DOJ subsequently undertook successful prosecutions against four former Gen Re executives and one former AIG executive: CEO Ronald Ferguson was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $200,000; CFO Elizabeth Monrad was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $250,000; Senior Vice President Christopher Garand was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $150,000; Senior Vice President and Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $100,000; AIG's Vice President Christian Milton was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $200,000. In 2009, in front of U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney in Hartford, Houldsworth apologized. He was resultantly fined $5,000 and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service during a two-year probation period. On August 1, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the five Gen Re and AIG defendants‚Äô convictions and remanded the defendants for a new trial, holding that the reported drop in share prices could not be attributed to the two reinsurance deals. =Resolution= \\"In June 2012, the U.S. government agreed to not pursue any further legal action against the former Gen Re executives pursuant to deferred prosecution agreements that have since expired and are no longer in effect. As a result, the government matter is fully and finally resolved. Civil litigation related to the AIG matter has also been fully and finally resolved. The lead plaintiffs and Gen Re reached a settlement agreement which the court approved pursuant to a final order entered on September 11, 2013.\\" Business Reinsurers \\"insure insurance companies\\", i.e., they will pay a portion of an insurance company's claims in exchange for a portion of the premium received by the insurance company for policies that cover those claims. As a direct reinsurer, Gen Re delivers reinsurance solutions to companies in all segments of the insurance industry on both a Treaty and Facultative basis.

In 1856, the company changed its name to \\"Fruit of the Loom\\", while producing its first muslins.History and more on FOTL website 1921 newspaper ad for Fruit of the Loom muslin fabric A friend of Robert Knight named Rufus Skeel owned a small shop in Providence that sold cloth from Knight's mill. Skeel's daughter painted images of apples and applied them to the bolts of cloth. The ones with the apple emblems proved most popular. Knight thought the labels would be the perfect symbol for his trade name, Fruit of the Loom ‚Äì an expression referring to clothes, paralleling the phrase \\"fruit of the womb\\" meaning \\"children\\", which can be traced back to the Bible (Psalm 127:3).

Farley in 1985 and renamed Farley Industries, Inc.Northwest Industries Inc., The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago, 2005, Chicago Historical Society; accessed April 6, 2018. Farley served as president, CEO, and majority shareholder for 15 years. Fruit of the Loom's sales revenue rose from approximately $500 million at the time of NWI's purchase to roughly $2.5 billion nearly 15 years later. Debt financing proved difficult to manage even as sales revenue quintupled. On March 23, 1987, it sold its subsidiary General Battery to Exide Corporation.https://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/24/business/company-news-fruit-of- the-loom.html company-news-fruit-of-the-loom.html The 1990s saw widespread downsizing of the American textile industry overall in the wake of North American Free Trade Agreement and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In 1995 Chairman Farley announced that the company would close six plants in the Southeastern United States, and cut back operations at two others. Operations were moved to cheaper plants abroad. 3,200 workers, or about 12 percent of its American work force, were laid off. Farley also announced that company earnings fell 22 percent, despite a 10 percent increase in sales. Fruit of the Loom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1999 shortly after posting a net loss of $576.2 million. Its 66 million shares of outstanding common stock dropped in value from about $44 per share in early 1997 to just more than $1 by spring 2000. Reasons for the bankruptcy are varied. A large debt load which was assumed in the 1980s, a common practice at the time, did not help. William F. \\"Bill\\" Farley, the company's former chairman, CEO, and COO, was ousted prior to the bankruptcy filing in late 1999, after having piloted the company into massive debt and unproductive business ventures, including structuring the company into an off-shore entity in the Cayman Islands to avoid taxes. =21st century= The company was bought from bankruptcy by Berkshire Hathaway Corporation, controlled by investor Warren Buffett, who wanted the valuable brand. He agreed in January 2002 to purchase the company for approximately $835 million in cash. The deal was concluded on April 29, 2002. A condition of the purchase required that former COO and then interim CEO John Holland remain available to be the CEO for the company. The company purchased Russell Brands, LLC, effectively taking the former competitor private, in a deal valued at $598.3 million that was completed August 1, 2006. The company announced the purchase of VF Corporation's intimate apparel company named Vanity Fair Intimates for $350 million in cash on January 23, 2007. This company was renamed Vanity Fair Brands and is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 2010, Rick Medlin was named president and CEO of Fruit of the Loom. Longtime CEO John Holland became the company's chairman. In 2014, the company closed its Jamestown, Kentucky, plant, which had once been the second manufacturing plant in the state, and laid off all 600 employees. The company acknowledged it was moving the plant's operations to Honduras to reduce production costs. In December 2016, Melissa Burgess Taylor was named chairman and CEO of Fruit of the Loom by Buffett after the death of Rick Medlin.

At the age of 16, he became part of the Shrapnel Records-produced duo Cacophony with his friend Marty Friedman. They released the albums Speed Metal Symphony in 1987 and Go Off! in 1988. Cacophony broke up in 1989 and Becker began doing solo work, having released his first album Perpetual Burn in 1988, also through Shrapnel. He later joined David Lee Roth's band and recorded one album with him, A Little Ain't Enough. Becker's performing career was cut short by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In 1996, Becker lost the ability to speak, and he now communicates with his eyes via a system developed by his father. He continues to compose using a computer and has since released with Shrapnel Collection, a \\"best of\\" album of his favorite songs and three new songs.  Biography and career  = Hometown, birthplace, school and early years = Becker was born and raised in Richmond, California, by his parents, Gary and Patricia (Heffley) Becker. He was born in Richmond Hospital on 23rd Street in 1969. His maternal grandfather was actor Wayne Heffley. Becker graduated from Kennedy High School where he performed Yngwie Malmsteen's \\"Black Star\\" with his band at a talent show. While still in high school, Becker was introduced to Marty Friedman. He was exposed to the guitar at an early age because both his father and his uncle were guitar players. He absorbed all kinds of music from around the world and melded different aspects of each style into his playing. He cited Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen as early influences. =Cacophony and solo career= Becker started out playing alongside Marty Friedman in the Mike Varney- produced duo, Cacophony. Together, they put out an album, and toured Japan and the U.S. While they never went mainstream in the U.S., they proved popular enough in Europe to sell out almost every performance. In 1989 Friedman left to join Megadeth and Becker began to pursue a solo career, having released his first solo album titled Perpetual Burn in 1988. He has since released the albums Perspective and Collection, as well as two albums of demos, entitled The Raspberry Jams and The Blackberry Jams. =Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis= At the age of 20, he joined David Lee Roth's band to work on Roth's album A Little Ain't Enough, replacing Steve Vai, who had joined Whitesnake. In 1990 Becker won the coveted Best New Guitarist award from Guitar Magazine. While preparing for the album, Becker began to feel what he called a \\"lazy limp\\" in his left leg. He was soon diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease) and was given three to five years to live. He finished the recording using lighter (thinner) gauge guitar strings and other techniques, which made it easier for him to play with his weakening hands. Although he managed to finish the album, which was released in 1991, he did not join the supporting tour due to his inability to perform on stage; former Lizzy Borden guitarist Joe Holmes took Becker's place on tour. His ALS gradually robbed him of his ability to play guitar, to walk, and eventually his ability to speak. He now communicates with his eyes via a system developed by his father. Due to the nature of the disease, he remains mentally sharp and, with the aid of a computer, continues composing. In the back of the Perspective CD case, Becker states \\"I have Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. It has crippled my body and speech, but not my mind.\\" His medical condition has remained stable since 1997. In 2003, Becker posted on his website that he was feeling better and had gained some weight, while the folder for his 2008 album Collection also mentions an upcoming book. =Perspective and the Raspberry Jams= In 1996, Becker released an album entitled Perspective, an instrumental album composed by him (with the exception of Bob Dylan's song \\"Meet Me in the Morning\\"). The writing of the music had been started before ALS completely crippled his abilities. By using guitar, and, later, when he was unable to use both hands, a keyboard, he continued to compose while his disease worsened. However, when Becker could no longer physically play even a keyboard, his friend and music producer Mike Bemesderfer helped him with a music-composing computer program that reads movements of his head and eyes, enabling Becker to continue to compose after he lost control of the rest of his body. Several years later, Becker released Raspberry Jams (1999) and Blackberry Jams (2003); the first contained various unreleased demo-tracks, and the latter contained demo-tracks and alternate versions of songs that were later reworked and published into other albums. Two tribute albums to Jason Becker have been issued. Respectively entitled Warmth in the Wilderness I and Warmth in the Wilderness II, they feature guitarists such as Steve Vai, Paul Gilbert, Marty Friedman, Joe Becker, Rusty Cooley, and Mattias Eklundh. The album profits were sent to Becker to help him with his medical finances. =Collection= On November 4, 2008, Shrapnel Records released a new Jason Becker album entitled Collection. The album includes three new songs in addition to some older recordings (some never before released) and features Marty Friedman, Greg Howe, Joe Satriani, Michael Lee Firkins, Steve Vai, and Steve Hunter. =Boy Meets Guitar= On August 20, 2010, Becker declared that he was considering releasing an album of music he recorded when he was in his teenage years. He has since released this album, titled Boy Meets Guitar, in 2012. =Triumphant Hearts= In October 2016, Becker launched a campaign to fund an album, which was initially estimated for release in July 2017. The campaign raised more than $100,000. The album, Triumphant Hearts was released on December 7, 2018. Musical style Considered a virtuoso guitarist and one of the top players of his time, Jason Becker studied the works of violinist Niccol√≤ Paganini and was a playing partner with Marty Friedman. He later arranged Paganini's 5th Caprice, performing it during an instructional guitar video. Becker's compositions often include high speed scalar and arpeggio passages‚Äîtrademarks of his shred style of guitar playing. Often incorporating advanced techniques such as sweep picking, alternate picking, artificial harmonic accenting, tapping and hybrid picking; he was among the leaders of the field during the technical shred guitar and neoclassical metal trend of the mid to late eighties and is still respected and honored by his musician peers today. The song Serrana appearing in the album Perspective, is an example of his sweep-picking skills. He demonstrated the arpeggio sequence during a clinic at the Atlanta Institute of Music. A video of this performance first appeared on his Hot Licks guitar instructional video. Equipment Becker's first guitar was a Franciscan acoustic. Prior to joining Cacophony in 1987, Becker worked his way through the Franciscan, a Takamine acoustic, a Fender Musicmaster, and finally, a black \\"Dan Smith\\" era Fender Stratocaster (likely a 1982 or 1983 model) with a DiMarzio Steve Morse humbucker in the bridge (seen in the \\"Black Star\\" video, circa 1986). On his message board, Becker said \\"I recorded SMS [Speed Metal Symphony] with my Strat.\\" For his next guitar, Becker said on his message board \\"Mike Varney got Hurricane to endorse us after we recorded Speed Metal Symphony. I liked how they were like Strats, only beefier.\\" On Perpetual Burn, Becker said on his message board: \\"I used my white and black Hurricane guitar for everything. For clean tone I went direct. For dirty tone I used a 100 Watt Marshall with a Boss Super Overdrive pedal.\\" The Moridira Hurricane guitar he used is called a Limited Edition LTD.2 model, believed to be made in Japan. (It is not a Hurricane EX series, which appears to be lower quality.) His LTD.2 was a \\"strat copy\\", but with a HSS pickup setup, a 24-fret rosewood fingerboard, and unique Floyd Rose where you don't have to cut the strings. For pickups, Becker said on his message board: \\"I just used the stock pickups it came with.\\" The pickups were Japanese-made pickups. While Becker is pictured with a blue Hurricane guitar on the cover of Perpetual Burn, he did not use this blue guitar on the album. Differences on this guitar from his first Hurricane include DiMarzio pickups, a maple fretboard, and 24 frets. (Marty Friedman recorded the whammy parts of his song \\"Dragon Mistress\\" using Becker's blue Hurricane, one of the rare times Marty has recorded whammy work.) For the second Cacophony album, Becker switched over to Carvin gear, utilizing 2 DC Series models, one in a trans blue finish with flamed maple top, and another one in a solid burgundy finish (This is the guitar seen in the famous \\"Yo Yo\\" video from the 1989 Japan tour with Cacophony). Both have double cutaway bodies, Kahler locking tremolo systems, 6 in line machine heads and 2 Carvin humbucker pickups. He used these up until he was diagnosed with ALS in 1989. During the sessions for A Little Ain't Enough, Becker used various Carvin, Ibanez, ESP and Valley Arts guitars, as well as a Les Paul on some tracks and a Gibson acoustic for select things. Becker has also been pictured with a few Hamer superstrats as well. From 1989‚Äì1991, Becker used various guitars, most notably a Peavey custom model with the numbered fretboard markers. Also used were an Ibanez Custom Shop guitar (probably based on an RG), a custom from Performance Guitars, a couple of various unknown Strat style guitars and a black Hurricane with 3 single coil pickups. As of very recently, Becker has allowed Paradise Guitars USA to release a Jason Becker signature guitar. It is similar in appearance to the numbered Peavey but with a different headstock shape. Becker used various types of amplifiers in his music. Before joining Cacophony, he used a small Peavey Studio Pro 40 with the older style Peavey vertical silver stripes on the grille cloth. During his early days Becker was also seen with a red Marshall JCM800 head and 4x12 cabinet. For the first Cacophony album, Becker used an ADAMP1 preamp. He recorded Perpetual Burn with a borrowed '70s Marshall half stack and a BOSS Super Overdrive and Cacophony's second album was recorded with a Carvin X100B stack. For the David Lee Roth album A Little Ain't Enough, Becker used \\"eight different Marshall amps.\\" He also used the SX300H head at some point during that era. After Cacophony Becker used various amps, including a \\"Fender M80\\", an unknown Marshall amp, an ADA Preamp and possibly the aforementioned Peavey combo. Becker typically used Dean Markley and SIT strings =Paradise Guitar= In 2008 Paradise Guitars worked with Becker to design a Jason Becker signature guitar. The design is based on the Peavey with colored number fret inlays. Features include an alder body, maple neck with steel 2-way truss rod, maple 16\\" radius fingerboard, 24 jumbo thin frets with colored number fret marker inlays, black Floyd Rose Pro Style floating Tremolo with Floyd Rose Tremolo stop, Sperzel red satin tuners, 14-degree tilt-back headstock with black Paradise logo and matching tremolo and electronics plates. The pickups are DiMarzio pickups; a PAF Pro-Custom in the neck colored yellow and red, a DP116 HS-2 in the middle colored green, and a Tone Zone-Custom in the bridge colored pink and blue. These colored pickups complement the colored inlays and seem to give the guitar a rainbow effect. There is also a red 5-way switch and purple 1‚Äì11 volume knob.Paradise Guitars USA =Kiesel/Carvin Tribute Guitars= In 2012 Carvin worked with Becker to design the JB200C Jason Becker Tribute, a guitar that is modeled after the original DC200 guitar he used toward the latter part of his career. The guitar features an Alder body with flamed maple top, maple neck with a flamed maple fingerboard, a Floyd Rose tremolo, jumbo frets, 2 humbuckers, active electronics, and comes standard in a transparent blue finish. In 2015, Kiesel Guitars, which took over Carvin's guitar manufacturing, worked with Becker to release a second tribute model, called the JB24 \\"Numbers\\" guitar. It is the third incarnation of his \\"Numbers\\" guitar, previously released by Peavey and Paradise guitars, and is also one of the first Carvin guitars to feature a 24-fret bolt-on neck, alongside the GH24 Greg Howe signature model released in the same year. It features a tung-oiled ash body, maple neck and fingerboard, colored number inlays, stainless steel frets, and 3 custom-colored Seymour Duncan pickups (Perpetual Burn in the bridge, Vintage Hot Stack in the middle, and Jazz in the neck). For the official launch of Becker's signature Seymour Duncan Perpetual Burn Humbucker and the Carvin JB24 numbers guitar, Danny Young was chosen as the guitarist for both performances due to stylistic resemblance to Jason Becker and Niccolo Paganini. The Perpetual Burn performance was played on the Carvin JB200C. These performances led to the widespread notability of Danny Young's virtuosity in the guitar community and an authority in the tone and playing style of Jason Becker.  Documentary film  A feature-length documentary film about the life of Jason Becker entitled Jason Becker: Not Dead Yet, was released in 2012. The film includes interviews with Becker, his family and friends, and the various musicians he's worked with, including Marty Friedman, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Richie Kotzen, and Steve Hunter. The film was generally well received by fans and critics and won many awards.

A Secretary of State also holds many similar responsibilities in assisting senior cabinet members, being members of the Ministry and the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. A Secretary of State is legally a Minister of State styled as secretaries. However Secretaries of State are considered junior to ministers of state and are not members of Cabinet. History The title \\"Minister of State\\" was created during the government of Pierre Trudeau in 1971 under the Ministries and Ministers of State Act. This act allows for the creation of two different types of ministers of state. Sections 2 through 10 allow for the creation of a ministry of state, which is a temporary government department established by separating parts of departments created by law. A minister of state can be the head of such a ministry. Sections 11 and 12 of the act allow for the creation of a minister of state who \\"may be assigned by the Governor in Council to assist any minister or ministers having responsibilities for any department or other portion of the public service of Canada in the carrying out of those responsibilities\\". The latter has become far more common and, by and large, the former has fallen into disuse. Under Brian Mulroney and his successors, the title of Minister of State without any responsibilities attached has been used to appoint what had previously been called ministers without portfolio. Ministers of State are also members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, as is required for them to be a part of the ministry. During the government of Jean Chr√©tien, assistants to senior cabinet ministers were often styled as secretary of state, considered junior to ministers of state, and were not members of Cabinet. Under Chr√©tien, the title \\"minister of state,\\" with a specific policy responsibility, was usually given to either a Cabinet minister, in addition to his or her other responsibilities, or to the deputy prime minister, government house leader or leader of the government in the Senate. Chr√©tien also had parliamentary secretaries, ranking below secretaries of state, who were set to two-year terms and the post was used as a reward for weary backbenchers. Their duty was to answer questions and table reports on behalf of ministers when they were unable to be present in the house. Paul Martin eliminated the position of secretary of state and reverted to using the title \\"minister of state\\" for junior cabinet ministers. The day he took office, Martin realigned various government departments. However, this can be done by changing the law only so, in reality, he set up various ministries of state headed by ministers of state. All such ministries of state and their ministers were styled as proper ministers of permanent departments. Over the course of his government, most of these departments were created in law and the ministers of state became ministers of the new departments as their empowering legislation received royal assent. When Stephen Harper became Prime Minister on February 6, 2006, he did not include any Ministers of State in his cabinet. Derek Burney, the head of Harper's transition team, noted to the press that this was intentional: Ministers of State and the role of Deputy Prime Minister were omitted to create a cabinet of full equals.https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c;=Article&cid;=1139267414261&call;_pageid=968332188774&col;=968350116467 In actuality, Harper did appoint a number of Ministers of State in order to give certain ministers responsibilities outside of their portfolios, however all of these Ministers of States were also full Cabinet ministers and their formal titles were styled such as to omit \\"of state\\".Canada Gazette Part I, Vol. 140, No. 8 On January 4, 2007, Harper added five Secretaries of State to his ministry thus reviving the practice of appointing junior ministers outside of the Cabinet. On October 30, 2008, Harper added 11 Ministers of State to his Cabinet. On January 4, 2011, Harper added one Minister of State to his Cabinet to a total of 12. In 2015, the 29th cabinet led by Justin Trudeau, formed and updated several ministries including the formation of Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities from the previous junior position Minister of State (Sport).

Career A former sales representative for Stanley Home Products, Wise was a divorcee with a son to support. She found Tupperware to be a product with broad appeal and began selling it at home parties. In 1950 she moved to Florida and created a social networking marketing system through dealers and sellers that quickly outsold Tupperware's store sales. This caught the attention of Earl Tupper, Tupperware's inventor, who invited her to be vice president of Tupperware Home Parties in 1951. She insisted that he market his products exclusively through party plans, where women invited friends and neighbors to a combination social event and sales presentation. Wise ran the sales division, Tupperware Home Parties, Inc, from Kissimmee, Florida and had the freedom to implement her marketing strategies. Her methods were extremely successful. Her ability to tap into popular culture and the desire for happiness helped recruit thousands of women into a career at a time when a woman's role was conventionally tied to the home. Her TV appearances, magazine and newspaper articles made her a household name. In 1954 she became the first woman to appear on the cover of Business Week. Wise invented much of the corporate culture of Tupperware and, by extension, other party-plan marketing organizations. She was especially keen on incentives, one of the chief ones being trips to Florida to the annual \\"Jubilee\\" at the company's sales headquarters for motivational meetings and socializing with other successful representatives. Top sellers would be presented with exotic gifts such as speedboats, trips and appliances carefully planned in the company of their husbands. She created idioms and rituals such as pilgrimage to a specially designed well in the Tupperware grounds for sellers to cast their wishes, \\"Brownie Wings\\" and costumed graduation ceremonies. Dealers would go on treasure hunts where prizes would be buried in the ground. Extravagant shows, parties and motivational talks made up the four-day convention. Wise was presented to the company's representatives as something of an idealized 1950s woman. She was skilled in leveraging the social networking model and motivating thousands of women to come together in their homes to sell Tupperware. The liberation of many women through earning their own salary in the context of male-driven post-World War II, pre-feminist culture of the 1950s created many challenges. Her own relationship with Earl Tupper was volatile, and their differences became irreconcilable after Wise's success turned her into a celebrity. In January 1958 Tupper forced Wise out. Soon afterward, every reference to her was removed from company literature. She owned no stock and left with a severance package of one year's salary, about $30,000. Wise attempted to form her own party-plan cosmetics company, Cinderella, but was unsuccessful; after this she largely faded from view and died in relative obscurity in 1992. Soon after Tupper parted ways with Wise, he sold the Tupperware organization to Dart Industries for US$16 million. In popular culture Wise will be the central character in an upcoming movie based on the book Tupperware Unsealed, written by Bob Kealing.

The facility is adjacent to Hanscom Field which provides general aviation and charter service. Hanscom AFB is the part of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, one of six centers under Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center is the single center responsible for total life cycle management of Air Force weapon systems and is headquartered at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The host unit at Hanscom is the 66th Air Base Group (66 ABG) assigned to AFMC. Overview A non-flying base, Hanscom Air Force Base is named after Laurence G. Hanscom (1906‚Äì1941), a pilot, aviation enthusiast, and State House reporter who was killed in a plane crash at Saugus, Massachusetts. Hanscom was a reporter for the Boston Globe, Worcester Telegram & Gazette and the Wilmington (MA) News. Hanscom was active in early aviation, founding the Massachusetts Civil Air Reserve. At the time of his death, Hanscom had been lobbying for the establishment of an airfield in Bedford. The base was named in his honor on 26 June 1941. Hanscom Field, a civilian general-aviation airport adjacent to the Air Force Base, and Massport are the primary operators of the air field and runways. Less than one percent of the air traffic at Hanscom Field is military aircraft. History =World War II= Hanscom Air Force Base began its existence while the United States was considering its entry into World War II. In May 1941, the Massachusetts Legislature authorized the purchase of a large tract of farmland spanning the borders of the towns of Bedford, Lincoln, Concord and Lexington for a Boston Auxiliary Airport. Funds to build the new airport were contributed by the federal government, which had appropriated $40 million to build 250 new civil airports across the United States that could serve for future national defense.Hanscom Air Force Base history In mid-1942, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts leased the Bedford airport to the War Department for use by the Army Air Forces. Fighter squadrons trained there in 1942 through 1943. The 85th Fighter Squadron and the 318th Fighter Squadron, who trained at Bedford on the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, went on to combat in North Africa and Europe. In February 1943, the airport was renamed Laurence G. Hanscom Field in honor of a Massachusetts-born pilot and aviation enthusiast who had been a reporter for the Worcester Telegram-Gazette. Hanscom had died in February 1941, in an aircraft accident in Saugus, Massachusetts, while he was lobbying vigorously at the State House for the establishment of the airport at Bedford. Later in the war, the Bedford Army Air Field served as a site for testing new radar sets developed by MIT's Radiation Laboratory. It was this secondary wartime activity at Hanscom that gave rise to the base's postwar role. =Cold War= Since 1945 Hanscom has emerged as the Air Force's center for the development and acquisition of electronic systems. The base has also played a significant role in the creation of a national high-technology area around Route 128. World War II established the key military importance of radar. In 1945, when the MIT and Harvard wartime laboratories were dissolved, the Army Air Forces aimed to continue some of their programs in radar, radio and electronic research. It recruited scientists and engineers from the laboratories, and its new Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories (AFCRL) took over MIT's test site at Hanscom Field. By 1950, the Air Force was working closely with MIT to develop a new air defense system for the continental United States. Expanding its facilities at Hanscom Field was a step to accomplishing this massive project. After some negotiation, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed in May 1952 to cede land on one side of the airport to the federal government and to give a 25-year renewable lease on the airfield itself. The first buildings for the new MIT Lincoln Laboratory at Hanscom were completed in 1952, and the Air Force's electronic and geophysics laboratories in Cambridge started to migrate out to its own new facilities in Bedford in 1954. The airfield's runways were reconfigured and expanded in 1953, and new hangars, headquarters and facilities were built. To provide test and evaluation for Lincoln Lab's new \\"Cape Cod\\" experimental air defense system, Hanscom's 6520th Test Support Wing logged thousands of hours of flying time. In April 1960, the 3245th Air Base Wing was organized to undertake routine support around the base.https://www.15wing.af.mil/UNITS/15th-Wing-Units/ retrieved October 2019. The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense computer system, completed in the early 1960s, revolutionized air defense and also contributed significantly to advances in air traffic control systems. As the SAGE system matured, the Air Force developed a number of advanced command, control and communications systems. In 1961 the Electronic Systems Division (ESD) was established at Hanscom Field in order to consolidate the management of the Air Force's electronic systems under one agency. Since that time, the ESD (re-designated the Electronic Systems Center in 1992) has been the host organization on the base. The 3245th Air Base Wing was redesignated as the 3245th Air Base Group on 1 July 1964, remaining responsible to the ESD. While Hanscom's role in system acquisition flourished after the 1950s, its operational mission gradually diminished. As of September 1973, all regular military flying operations at Hanscom ceased. The following year the Air Force terminated its lease of the airfield portion of Hanscom Field, which reverted to state control, but retained the right to use the field. The Air Force re-designated its own acreage surrounding the field as the Laurence G. Hanscom Air Force Base. In 1977 the name was shortened to the present Hanscom Air Force Base. The base saw a second wave of construction during the 1980s. The Electronic Systems Division put up four new systems management engineering facilities (the O'Neill, Brown, Shiely and Bond buildings). For base personnel, there were new service facilities‚Äîmedical, youth and family support centers‚Äîas well as additional housing and a temporary lodging facility. =Post Cold War= Since July 1992, Hanscom and the Electronic Systems Center (ESC) have been part of the Air Force Materiel Command. In 1994 the Air Force designated ESC as the Air Force Center of Excellence for Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I). The 3245th Air Base Group was redesignated the 647th Support Group on 1 October 1992, and then the 647th Air Base Group (647th ABG) on 1 October 1993. The 647th ABG was then inactivated on 1 October 1994, and its mission taken up by the 66th Air Base Wing. The Standard Systems Group at Gunter Annex, Maxwell AFB, Ala.; the 38th Engineering Installation Wing at Tinker AFB, Okla.; the Materiel Systems Group at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio; and lastly the Cryptologic Systems Group at Kelly AFB, Texas; were all attached to ESC between 1993 and 1996 in order to consolidate related functions in AFMC under the Center, and to support its expanded mission. Subsequent reorganizations changed the groupings, but all the above organizations (though renamed) except the 38th EIW remained under Hanscom's reporting chain. In 2004, ESC was reorganized into a named wing, group and squadron unit, to better reflect the organization of the Air Force as a whole. In 2006, the wings, groups and squadrons were given numbered designations. In 2010, ESC reverted to an organization of program offices and the 38th Engineering Installation Wing (by then a group) was reassigned. New Air Force standards caused the 66th Air Base Wing, because of its size, to be redesignated the 66th Air Base Group. In June 2011, the Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate moved from Hanscom to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, and the Space Vehicles Directorate moved to Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, closing more than 60 years of laboratory presence on Hanscom. The Electronic Systems Center as an organization was realigned in July 2012, and became a part of the newly created Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. =Incidents/accidents= The B-25 bomber which crashed into the Empire State Building on 28 July 1945, took off from Hanscom. On 8 August 1962, a US Air Force KC-135, a modified former tanker, crashed on approach to runway 11, destroying the aircraft and killing all three members of the flight crew. =Previous names= 2006 USGS aerial photo of Hanscom AFB * Laurence G.

Historically, it referred to the chest located in the homes or barracks of soldiers, in which the soldier kept arms and armor. In the modern era, it more often refers to a collection of funds (or less occasionally special tools or equipment) intended to allow a person or organization to get through a situation that requires much more readiness or money than usual. Etymology In arms and armor, a war chest is a container for the personal weapons and protective gear of a citizen-soldier, kept in the household, and is the origin of the term. The term's modern meaning originates with the medieval practice of having a chest, literally, filled with money to open in time of war. In politics In politics, a war chest is funding obtained from donors well in advance of a campaign, usually accumulated by an incumbent for either re-election or to contest a more advanced office, or provided by a wealthy candidate to their own campaign. The possession of such excess funds may discourage otherwise viable candidates from a primary or general election challenge. In business In business a war chest, or cash mountain is a stash of money set aside to deal with unexpected changes in the business environment, or to use when expansion possibilities arise.ICI eyes buy-ups with ¬£1bn war chest Independent, 9 February 2007, accessed 19 September 2009 Today companies can use accumulated cash or rely on quickly raised debt which costs less to carry when you don't need it. This is not always a reasonable substitute, as the credit available to a company typically drops as a result of the same actions that require the war chest to be opened. Companies can redistribute their war chests to shareholders by issuing larger or special dividends, or more commonly through share buyback operations. Companies do this because if actually held in cash, the companies will be earning a low rate of return in the money markets, whereas they could be using the funds to invest in more profitable projects. If they continue not to invest the funds, shareholders may sell the company's shares and make it vulnerable to a takeover. This would place the current management's jobs at risk. In professional sports In Association football it refers to the amount of money a manager has been given by a club's chairman, owner or investors to acquire new players. Related terms Similar terms are also referred to as surplus cash, cash reserves, emergency reserves, acquisition funds, rainy day funds, or undistributed earnings within different contexts.

Juggling clubs are often simply called clubs by jugglers and sometimes are referred to as pins or batons by non-jugglers. Clubs are one of the three most popular props used by jugglers; the others being balls and rings. A typical club is in the range of long, weighs between , is slim at the \\"handle\\" end, and has its center of balance nearer the wider \\"body\\" end. The definition of a club is somewhat ambiguous; sticks or rods are allowed under the current Juggling Information Service rules for juggling world records. A juggling club's shape is similar to a bowling pin's and an Indian club's. Modern juggling clubs are, however, distinct from these objects because they differ in the materials they are made of, the way they are constructed, their weight and weight distribution, and are therefore not usually interchangeable.  Types  Juggling clubs are manufactured from different materials and construction methods and can therefore be divided into a number of broad types. = Wood clubs = Early 20th century clubs were made entirely of wood: they had solid handles with large bodies which were hollowed to reduce weight. This style of club was manufactured by Edward Van Wyck and Harry Lind and are most often called American style juggling clubs because of their size and shape. In Europe, juggling clubs were constructed using solid cork bodies with wood handles or were very thin profiled solid wood clubs which were actually more stick-like in their construction. =Plastic clubs= With the invention of various plastics constructing juggling clubs was made easier and mass production of a variety of club sizes, shapes, weights and colours began.  One-piece clubs  One-piece plastic clubs are constructed as a single plastic moulded prop. The handle and body are therefore made from the same material and the club is hollow. One-piece clubs are very durable and are cheaper than composite or multi-piece clubs to make and buy. Despite these virtues, one-piece clubs are less popular among jugglers than multi-piece ones because the handles do not have any give making them occasionally more painful to catch.  Multi-piece clubs  Multi-piece or composite clubs are constructed using a number of parts of different materials. The core of the club is an internal rod, usually of wood but sometimes metal which provides a uniform structure about which the body and handle of the club can be attached. The body is made of a single moulded shape of plastic and the handle is made of a wrapping of either thin flexible plastic or sometimes cloth. The wrapped construction of the handle creates a more flexible grip making these clubs easier to catch during long periods of juggling. Foam ends attached to the top of the body and round or semi-conical knobs attached to the base of the handle protect the club's ends from impacts. This design was pioneered by Jay Green in the 1960s with off the shelf components. It was refined by Brian Dube, beginning in 1975 with the first custom production moulds. Multi-piece clubs are made in both a thin European style or larger bodied American style and in various lengths, generally ranging from . Club decoration Both one- piece and multi-piece clubs are often decorated with coloured tape or with specific decorations created by the club manufacturers. The range of decoration include full body and handle decoration in various colours including glitter variations and \\"European\\" decorations which only decorate parts of the club. Basic juggling The basic pattern of club juggling, as in ball juggling, is the cascade. Clubs are thrown from alternate hands; each passes underneath the other clubs and is caught in the opposite hand to the one from which it was thrown. At its simplest, each club rotates once per throw but double, triple or multiple spins are frequently performed. Tricks A wide variety of tricks which are beyond the normal cascade pattern are possible with clubs. Most ball-juggling tricks can be performed with clubs, though they are generally more difficult to learn because of the size of the clubs and the extra complexity added by their rotation. However, for tricks involving juggling a basic cascade under other constraints, such as while unicycling or blindfolded, club juggling is easier, given the lower accuracy required to make each catch. =Unique club tricks= Juggling clubs are used to perform unique tricks which are not possible with other juggling props like balls and rings. Examples of these include chin rolls, helicopter spins, various types of traps, and various types of throws unique to clubs because of the shape and spin of these props. A flourish is a trick in which a performer spins the club around the fingers of one hand. The club actually makes two revolutions around its center of gravity, once on the medial side of the juggler's hand and once on the lateral side.  Passing  Clubs are the prop of choice for passing between jugglers. There are many reasons for this but some of the key ones are: juggling clubs have a larger catching area than balls; the variety of tricks that can be performed exceed either ball or ring passing; and they are visually more noticeable when viewed by an audience. Beginners club passing is generally done with six clubs between two jugglers, each passing a single club to their partner every fourth beat. The passes are made from one juggler's right hand to the other juggler's left hand, so the clubs travel perpendicular to both jugglers. This basic pattern is called four count or every-others. More advanced club passing can involve more objects, more jugglers and more intricate patterns. A notation for describing club passing patterns, called causal notation, was developed by Martin Frost of the Stanford Juggling Research Institute. The other main notation style is that of \\"four-handed siteswap\\" - a variation of basic siteswap. Combat/gladiators Combat, often known as Gladiators in Europe, is a popular competitive group juggling activity. A \\"last man standing\\" competition, the participating jugglers maintain a base level of juggling, normally a three club cascade, within a limited area. Participants who drop a club, or go out of bounds, have lost the round and are expected to remove themselves (and their clubs if necessary) from the competition area. The rules of combat juggling vary from country to country and juggling convention to convention. The most common rules do not allow participants to deliberately come into body to body contact with each other but they are allowed to use their clubs to interfere with other participants' cascades. Multiple rounds may be played, with the winner being the first to win a set number of rounds, or the person with the most wins by a set end time. Records The world record for most clubs juggled (i.e., longest time or most catches with each club at minimum being thrown and caught at least twice without dropping) is eight clubs for 16 catches, achieved by Anthony Gatto in 2006 and Willy Colombaioni in 2015. The record for most clubs flashed (i.e., each prop thrown and caught only once) is nine, achieved by Eivind Dragsj√∏ in 2016 (11 Catches).

A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and combined in the right mixture.IFSTA, 2008 p. 88. A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in the fire triangle. For example, covering a fire with a fire blanket blocks oxygen and can extinguish a fire. In large fires where firefighters are called in, decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area. Fire tetrahedron :Not to be confused with NFPA 704, also called the fire diamond. The fire tetrahedron The fire tetrahedron represents the addition of a component in the chemical chain reaction, to the three already present in the fire triangle. Once a fire has started, the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the fire and allows it to continue until or unless at least one of the elements of the fire is blocked. Foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen it needs. Water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the ignition point or to remove or disperse the fuel. Halon can be used to remove free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the chemical reaction responsible for the fire. Combustion is the chemical reaction that feeds a fire more heat and allows it to continue. When the fire involves burning metals like lithium, magnesium, titanium,http://www.titanium.com/titanium/tech_manual/tech16.cfm Titanium MSDS etc. (known as a class-D fire), it becomes even more important to consider the energy release. The metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is released. Putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even exploding. Carbon dioxide extinguishers are ineffective against certain metals such as titanium. Therefore, inert agents (e.g. dry sand) must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion. In the same way, as soon as one of the four elements of the tetrahedron is removed, combustion stops. Oxidizer The oxidizer is the other reactant of the chemical reaction. In most cases, it is the ambient air, and in particular one of its components, oxygen (O2). By depriving a fire of air, it can be extinguished. For example, when covering the flame of a small candle with an empty glass, fire stops. To the contrary, if air is blown over a wood fire (as with bellows), the fire is activated by the introduction of more air. Some chemicals, such as fluorine gas, perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate, or chlorine trifluoride, act as oxidizers, sometimes more powerful ones than oxygen itself. A fire based on a reaction with these oxidizers can be very difficult to put out until the oxidizer is exhausted; that leg of the fire triangle cannot be broken by normal means (i.e., depriving it of air will not smother it). In certain cases such as some explosives, the oxidizer and combustible are the same (e.g., nitroglycerin, an unstable molecule that has oxidizing parts in the same molecule as the oxidizeable parts). Reaction is initiated by an activating energy, in most cases, it is heat. Several examples include friction, as in case of matches, heating an electrical wire, a flame (propagation of fire), or a spark (from a lighter or from any starting electrical device). There are also many other ways to bring sufficient activation energy including electricity, radiation, and pressure, all of which will lead to a temperature rise. In most cases, heat production enables self-sustainability of the reaction, and enables a chain reaction to grow. The temperature at which a liquid produces sufficient vapor to get a flammable mix with self-sustainable combustion is called its flash-point. Extinction of the fire To stop a combustion reaction, one of the three elements of the fire triangle must be removed. Without sufficient heat, a fire cannot begin, and it cannot continue. Heat can be removed by the application of a substance which reduces the amount of heat available to the fire reaction. This is often water, which absorbs heat for phase change from water to steam. Introducing sufficient quantities and types of powder or gas in the flame reduces the amount of heat available for the fire reaction in the same manner. Scraping embers from a burning structure also removes the heat source. Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the ignition source. Without fuel, a fire will stop. Fuel can be removed naturally, as where the fire has consumed all the burnable fuel, or manually, by mechanically or chemically removing the fuel from the fire. Fuel separation is an important factor in wildland fire suppression, and is the basis for most major tactics, such as controlled burns. The fire stops because a lower concentration of fuel vapor in the flame leads to a decrease in energy release and a lower temperature. Removing the fuel thereby decreases the heat. Without sufficient oxygen, a fire cannot begin, and it cannot continue. With a decreased oxygen concentration, the combustion process slows. Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, a fire blanket or water. Role of water in fire-fighting Water can have two different roles. In the case of a solid combustible, the solid fuel produces pyrolyzing products under the influence of heat, commonly radiation. This process is halted by the application of water, since water is more easily evaporated than the fuel is pyrolyzed. Thereby energy is removed from the fuel surface and it is cooled and the pyrolysis is stopped, removing the fuel supply to the flames. In fire fighting, this is referred to as surface cooling. In the gas phase, i.e. in the flames or in the smoke, the combustible can not be separated from the oxidizer, and the only possible action consists of cooling down. In this case, water droplets are evaporated in the gas phase, thereby lowering the temperature and adding water vapour making the gas mixture non combustible. This requires droplets of a size less than about 0.2 mm. In fire fighting, this is referred to as gas cooling or smoke cooling. Cases also exist where the ignition factor is not the activation energy. For example, a smoke explosion is a very violent combustion of unburned gases contained in the smoke created by a sudden fresh air input (oxidizer input). The interval in which an air/gas mix can burn is limited by the explosive limits of the air. This interval can be very small (kerosene) or large (acetylene). Water cannot be used on certain type of fires: *Fires where live electricity is present ‚Äì as water conducts electricity it presents an electrocution hazard. *Hydrocarbon fires ‚Äì as it will only spread the fire because of the difference in density/hydrophobicity. For example, adding water to a fire with an oil source will cause the oil to spread, since oil and water do not mix. *Metal fires ‚Äì as these fires produce huge amounts of energy (up to 7.550 calories/kg for aluminium) and water can also create violent chemical reactions with burning metal (possibly even serving as an additional oxidizing agent). Since these reactions are well understood, it has been possible to create specific water-additives which will allow: *A better heat absorption with a higher density than water. *Carrying free radical catchers on the fire. *Carrying foaming agents to enable water to stay on the surface of a liquid fire and prevent gas release. *Carrying specific reactives which will react and change the nature of the burning material. Water-additives are generally designed to be effective on several categories of fires (class A + class B or even class A + class B + class F), meaning a better global performance and usability of a single extinguisher on many different types of fires (or fires that involve several different classes of materials).  Multi-scale fire triangles for wildland fires  Multi-scale fire triangles describing the elements of wildland fire at the scale of the flame, a wildfire, and a fire regime. Adapted from Moritz et al. (2005) Wildfire, complexity, and highly optimized tolerance. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 102, 17912-17917. In the context of wildland fire, the fire triangle can be scaled up to apply to understand fire spread over landscapes (scales of days and several kilometres) and recurrence of fire over time (scales of decades and hundreds of kilometres). Thus, while heat is important to ignite a flame, topography is important for aiding fire spread especially by preheating upslope fuels, and ignitions sources are important to help explain recurrence on longer time scales. Similarly, while oxygen is relevant to sustain a flame, weather and associated winds feed oxygen into a spreading fire, and the longer-term pattern of weather is summarized as climate. Lastly, fuels is the term to describe what burns in a single flame to the range of materials burnt in a spreading wildfire, but fuels vary over larger space and time scales in what is called vegetation. At the smallest scale, the combustion fire triangle, individual fuel particles are ignited once at a critical temperature, and fire transfers energy to the nearest surroundings. Combustion events range on the scale of several seconds to a couple of days and their effects are monitored at the quadrant scale. The largest scale, in contrast, describes the fire regime concept. Global climate change drives many of the factors involved in the 'wildfire' and the 'fire regime' triangles. For example, with respect to the fire regime, a particular vegetation type will support a characteristic fire in terms of recurrence, intensity, seasonality and biological effects; a change in vegetation type will have implications for a changing fire regime.

The district lies in central Himachal and is famous for its tourist stations and Himalayan Treks connecting the trails with far remote regions between the adjacent districts of Lahaul and Spiti, Kinnaur , Mandi and Kangra districts which are bordered at North - North East , East , West and South Of Kullu respectively. The District is also a home to some of the Ancient settlements, Traditional Handloom and Apple Cultivation. It stretches from the Town of Rampur in the south to the Rohtang Pass in the North. The Main Kullu Valley which falls between the Pir Panjal Himalayas and Northern Edge Of The Dhauladhar or Bhangal Region lies at an elevation ranging from as less as 833 M to 3330 M from Aut Tunnel North Portal ( Some areas meshed in Mandi District Administrative Limits ) to Atal Tunnel South Portal On NH 3 and NH 505. Fields & Beas River in Kullu District of Himachal Pradesh, India. The largest valley in the district is called the Kullu Valley, which is also known as the Valley of the Gods. There is also a town called Kullu which sits on the banks of the Beas River in the central part of the valley. From the confluence of the Parvati River with the River Beas, the Parvati Valley runs eastwards, through a steep-sided valley from the town of Bhuntar. Another important valley in the district is the Lug valley where the main forest contractors have been extracting timber from the forests for the last 150 years and continue to do so today. Farther north lies the town of Manali. The ancient seat of the kings of Kullu was at Naggar Castle, about 12 km north of the present town, and thought to have been built in the early 17th century by Raja Sidh Sing. Raja Jagat Singh (1637‚Äì72) moved the capital in the middle of the 17th century to its present position, and called it Sultanpur. The Royal compound consists of the \\"Rupi Palace, several temples, and a long narrow bazaar descending the hill.\\" The British took all of Kangra and Kullu from the Sikhs in 1846. It is still used as home by the royal descendants, but the more ancient Naggar Castle was sold to the British. Since the onset of the most recent unrest in Kashmir, Manali and the Kullu Valley in general, have become important destinations for tourists escaping the summer heat of India. In the eastern part of the district, the village of Manikaran contains Sikh and Hindu temples and popular hot springs. The Hidimba Devi Temple is at Manali. There are also many Sikh villages located close to Manikaran. To the northeast of Kullu Valley, lies the famous, Malana Valley. Demographics According to the 2011 census, the district had a population of 437,903.

This will require specific configurations of lighting, signal lights, and safety equipment. Some specialty vehicles that will not be operated on roads therefore do not need all the features of a street-legal vehicle; examples are a vehicle used only off-road (such as a sandrail) that is trailered to its off-road operating area, and a racing car that is used only on closed race tracks and therefore does not need all the features of a street-legal vehicle. As well as motor vehicles, the street-legal distinction applies in some jurisdictions to track bicycles that lack street-legal brakes and lights. Street legality rules can even affect racing helmets, which possess visual fields too narrow for use on an open road without the risk of missing a fast-moving vehicle. The Porsche 911 GT1 '98 \\"Stra√üenversion\\" (German: Roadworthy Version) is a street-legal racing car and a single copy of the racing version, that succeeded at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1998. Canada In Canada, all ten provinces follow a consistent set of national criteria issued by Transport Canada for specific equipment required as part of a street-legal vehicle. In some provinces, the Highway Traffic Act is a matter of provincial jurisdiction; provinces with such an Act include Ontario, Manitoba, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Many but not all U.S.-model vehicles do qualify for import to Canada, but must meet requirements for items such as daytime running lights (standard on Canadian-market vehicles since 1991, but not required in the U.S.), anti-theft immobilisers, and anchorage points for child seats.The Registrar of Imported Vehicles, a private company under contract by Transport Canada, provides some information on which US-model vehicles are or can be made street-legal in Canada. Cars from other countries (such as the UK) typically do not qualify, as standards are too widely divergent from those in Canada. Laws regarding aftermarket items such as snow tires and radar detectors vary widely between provinces. India Requirements for manufacturing, registering, and operating motor vehicles in India are codified by the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR), as maintained by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. Street-legal two-, three-, and four-wheeled vehicles must comply with structure, safety equipment, and operating conditions in CMVR 93‚Äì125. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, vehicles must pass the Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) scheme, a pre- registration inspection for cars and light goods vehicles that have not been type-approved to British or European standards. Since August 2001, there have been two levels of SVA, those being 'standard' and 'enhanced'. The standard SVA is applied to vehicles such as left-hand drive vehicles, personally imported vehicles, amateur built vehicles and armoured vehicles, to name a few. Vehicles which do not fall into one of the standard SVA categories for example a vehicle of right-hand drive require enhanced SVA in addition to standard SVA inspections. The SVA is in the process of being replaced by the Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA). United States In the United States, the individual states have the authority to determine, by means of statutes and regulations, which types of vehicles are permitted on public streets, as a function of police power. Vehicles that are considered street-legal in the U.S. include automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles. Some vehicles that are not generally sold for on-road driving such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) and golf carts can potentially be adapted for street use, if permitted by state law. Most requirements for automobiles are largely consistent between U.S. states. A notable exception is California emission control, which has traditionally been more strict than that in other states. Common requirements for automobiles include structure (examples: hood) and safety equipment (examples: headlamps and bumpers). Common requirements for motorcycles include side view mirrors and a dedicated seat in order to transport a passenger. However, states vary widely on other equipment such as turn signals.

Hartz was born in Youngstown, Ohio, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, but grew up in Omaha, Nebraska. After graduating from Technical High School in Omaha, he attended Harvard University, financed partly by a scholarship from the Omaha World Herald. Career Hartz graduated in 1940, spent a year traveling abroad on a fellowship, and returned to Harvard as a teaching fellow in 1942. He earned his doctorate in 1946 and became a full professor of government in 1956. Hartz was known at Harvard for his talented and charismatic teaching. He retired in 1974 for ill health and spent his last years living in London, New Delhi, New York City, then Istanbul, where he died of an epileptic seizure. Hartz is best known for his classic book The Liberal Tradition in America (1955), which presented a view of America's past that sought to explain its conspicuous absence of ideologies. Hartz argued that American political development occurs within the context of an enduring, underlying Lockean liberal consensus, which has shaped and narrowed the landscape of possibilities for U.S. political thought and behavior. He attributed the triumph of the liberal worldview in America to its lack of a feudal past and thus the absence of a struggle to overcome a conservative internal order, to its vast resources and open space, and to the liberal values of the original settlers, who represented only a narrow middle-class slice of European society. Hartz was chiefly concerned with explaining the failure of socialism to become established in America, and he believed that Americans' pervasive, unthinking consensual acceptance of classic liberalism was the major barrier.Samuel H. Beer \\"Hartz, Louis\\", The \\"American National Biography (2003) https://doi.org/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1401127 In The Founding of New Societies (1964), Hartz developed the idea that the nations that developed from settler colonies were European \\"fragments\\" that in a sense froze the class structure and underlying ideology prevalent in the mother country at the time of their foundation and did not experience the further evolution experienced in Europe. He considered Latin America and French Canada to be fragments of feudal Europe, the United States, English Canada, and Dutch South Africa to be liberal fragments, and Australia and English South Africa to be \\"radical\\" fragments (incorporating the nonsocialist working class radicalism of Britain in the early 19th century). Hartz led a normal life until a sudden unexplained emotional disturbance changed his entire personality in 1971. He refused all medical help. He divorced in 1972, rejected all his friends, and feuded intensely with students, faculty and administrators. In 1974 he resigned from Harvard, but his scholarly skills and interests remained strong.Beer, American National Biography (2003) Legacy In 1956, the American Political Science Association awarded Hartz its Woodrow Wilson Prize for The Liberal Tradition in America, and in 1977 gave him its Lippincott Prize, designed to honor scholarly works of enduring importance. The book remains a key text in the political science graduate curriculum in American politics in universities today, in part because of the extensive, longrunning criticism and commentary that Hartz's ideas have generated. Hartz's fragment thesis was disseminated and elaborated upon for the Canadian context by Gad Horowitz, in his essay \\"Conservatism, Liberalism and Socialism in Canada: An Interpretation\\" (1966). Horowitz's influential interpretation was still actively debated into the 21st century in Canadian political theory. In Australia, Hartz's fragment thesis \\"received respectful attention, but ... did not win assent or committed followers\\", according to historian John Hirst. It was applied to early colonial history by feminist historian Miriam Dixson in The Real Matilda (1976), in which she traced gender relations in colonial New South Wales to the culture of the proletarian fragment identified by Hartz. In 1973, the Australian Economic History Review dedicated an issue to analysis of Hartz's theory. Bibliography =Books= *Economic Policy and Democratic Thought: Pennsylvania 1776-1860. 1948.

A one penny 1879 revenue stamp of Griqualand West. Griqualand West (in the centre of the map) in South Africa, July 1885. Griqualand West is an area of central South Africa with an area of 40,000 km¬≤ that now forms part of the Northern Cape Province. It was inhabited by the Griqua people - a semi-nomadic, Afrikaans- speaking nation of mixed-race origin, who established several states outside the expanding frontier of the Cape Colony. It was also inhabited by the pre- existing Tswana and Khoisan peoples. In 1873 it was proclaimed as a British colony, with its capital at Kimberley, and in 1880 it was annexed by the Cape Colony. When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, Griqualand West was part of the Cape Province but continued to have its own \\"provincial\\" sports teams. Early history The indigenous population of the area were the Khoi- khoi and Bushmen peoples, who were hunter-gatherers or herders. Early on they were joined by the agriculturalist Batswana, who migrated into the area from the north. They comprised the majority of the population throughout the region's history, up until the present day. By the early 19th century the whole area came to be dominated by the powerful Griqua people, who gave the region its name. Independent Griqua state =Origins of the Griqua people= The Griqua are a mixed people who originated in the intermarriages between Dutch colonists in the Cape and the Khoikhoi already living there. They turned into a semi-nomadic Afrikaans-speaking nation of horsemen who migrated out of the Cape Colony and established short-lived states on the Colony's borderlands, similar to the Cossack states of imperial Russia. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) did not intend the Cape Colony at the Southern tip of Africa to become a political entity. As it expanded and became more successful, its leaders did not worry about frontiers. The frontier of the colony was indeterminate and ebbed and flowed at the whim of individuals. While the VOC undoubtedly benefited from the trading and pastoral endeavours of the trekboers, it did little to control or support them in their quest for land. The high proportion of single Dutch men led to their taking indigenous women as wives and companions, and mixed-race children were born. They grew to be a sizeable population who spoke Dutch and were instrumental in developing the colony. These children did not attain the social or legal status accorded their fathers, mostly because colonial laws recognised only Christian forms of marriage. This group became known as Basters, or bastards. The colonists, in their paramilitary response to insurgent resistance from Khoi and San people, readily conscripted the Basters into commandos. This ensured the men became skilled in lightly armed, mounted, skirmish tactics. =Griqua migrations= Equipped with guns and horses, many of the Basters who were recruited to war chose instead to abandon their paternal society and to strike out and live a semi-nomadic existence beyond the Cape's frontier. The resulting stream of disgruntled, Dutch-speaking, trained marksmen leaving the Cape hobbled the Dutch capability to crew their commandos. It also created belligerent, skilled groups of opportunists who harassed the indigenous populations the length of the Orange River. Once free of the colonies, these groups called themselves the Oorlam. In particular, the group led by Klaas Afrikaner became notorious. He attracted enough attention from the Dutch authorities to cause him to be rendered to the colony and banished to Robben Island in 1761. One of the most influential of these Oorlam groups was the \\"Griqua\\". In the 19th century, the Griqua controlled several political entities which were governed by Kapteins or Kaptyns (Dutch for \\"Captain\\", i.e. leader) and their Councils, with their own written constitutions. The Griqua had also largely adopted the Afrikaans language before their migrations. Adam Kok I, the first Kaptein of the Griqua and recognised by the British, was originally a slave who had bought his own freedom. He led his people north from the interior of the Cape Colony. Probably because of discrimination against his people, they again moved north‚Äîthis time outside the Cape, taking over areas previously controlled by San and Tswana people. This area, where most of the Griqua nation settled, was near the Orange River, just west of the Orange Free State, and on the southern skirts of the Transvaal. It came to be called Griqualand West, and the territory was centered on its capital \\"Klaarwater\\", later renamed Griekwastad (\\"Griquatown\\"). The Griqua Kaptein Andries Waterboer and his sons =Waterboer dynasty and Griqualand West= While much of the Griqua people now settled, many remained nomadic, and Adam Kok's people later split into several semi- nomadic nations. After a significant schism, a portion of the Griqua nation migrated to the south-east under the leadership of Adam Kok's son Adam Kok II (to the south-east they were later to found Philippolis and then Griqualand East.Jeroen G. Zandberg. 2005. Rehoboth Griqua Atlas. . In the original area, which now came to be called Griqualand West, Andries Waterboer took over control and founded the powerful Waterboer dynasty. The Waterboer Kapteins ruled the region until the influx of Europeans accompanying the discovery of diamonds, and to some degree afterwards too. In 1834, the Cape Colony recognized Waterboer‚Äôs rights to his land and people. It signed a treaty with him to ensure payment for the use of the land for mining. In both Griqualands, East and West, the Griqua were demographically outnumbered by the pre-existing Bantu people and, in some areas, by European settlers, and thus the two Griqualands maintained their Griqua identity only through political control. Diamond fields and land disputes Map (1873) In the years 1870-1871 a large number of diggers moved into Griqualand West and settled on the diamond fields near the junction of the Vaal and Orange rivers. This was land through which the Griqua regularly moved with their herds and it was additionally situated in part on land claimed by both the Griqua chief Nicholas Waterboer and by the Boer Republic of the Orange Free State. In 1870, Transvaal President Marthinus Wessel Pretorius declared the diamond fields as Boer property and established a temporary government over the diamond fields. The administration of this body was not satisfactory to the Boers, the diggers, the Griqua or the indigenous Tswana. Tension rapidly grew between these parties until Stafford Parker, a former British sailor, organised a faction of the diggers to drive all of the Transvaal officials out of the area. =Diggers Republic (1870-71)= At the settlement of Klipdrift, on 30 July 1870 Stafford Parker declared the independent Klipdrift Republic (also known as the Digger's Republic and the Republic of Griqualand West) and was also chosen as President. Klipdrift was promptly renamed \\"Parkerton\\" after the new President, who began to collect taxes (often at gunpoint). Factions in the Republic also implored the British Empire to impose its authority and annex the territory. By December of the same year about 10 000 British settlers made their home in the new republic. The republic sat next to the Vaal River, but existed for an extremely short time. During the following year, Boer forces unsuccessfully attempted to regain the territory through negotiation. British Governor Sir Henry Barkly was asked to mediate. Barkly set up the Keate Committee to hear evidence and, in the famous \\"Keate Award\\", ruled against the Boer Republics and in favour of Nicholas Waterboer. Direct British rule (1871-1880) At this juncture, Waterboer offered to place the territory under the administration of Queen Victoria. The offer was accepted, and on 27 October 1871 the district, together with some adjacent territory to which the Transvaal had laid claim, was proclaimed (under the name of Griqualand West Colony) British territory. =Further territorial disputes= David Arnot, Griqua lawyer and diplomat Territorial disputes continued, even after the British annexation. When the annexation had taken place, a party in the Orange Free State volksraad had wished to go to war with Britain but the wiser counsels of its President prevailed. The Orange Free State did not abandon its claims, believing that the diamond fields were the means of restoring the credit and prosperity of the Free State. Griqualand West was not financially viable, and carried with it enormous public debt. The matter continued for a considerable time and caused immense tension in southern Africa. In the face of claims from the Orange Free State and the Griqua authorities, the Griqualand West Land Court was established in 1875, under Justice Andries Stockenstr√∂m. Waterboer's claims to the diamond fields, strongly presented by his agent David Arnot, were based on the treaty concluded by his father with the British in 1834 and on various arrangements with the Kok chiefs; the Orange Free State based its claim on its purchase of Adam Kok's sovereign rights and on long occupation. The difference between proprietorship and sovereignty was confused or ignored. That Waterboer exercised no authority in the disputed district was admitted. In a crucial finding Stockenstr√∂m ruled that, as the Griqua people were nomadic, the Griqua chiefs (or \\"captains\\") were rulers over a people, but not over a fixed territory. The Griqua people had also only arrived in this part of southern Africa a little over 50 years before, in the early nineteenth century. The Griqua captains therefore did not automatically get the right to own & develop all of the land through which they moved, but only those areas in which they would settle. Other areas they could continue to move through, but were not given automatic title to own and develop. This resulted in the denial of many of the titles issued by the powerful Griqua Captain Nicolaas Waterboer, outside of his core areas around Griquatown and Albania, were also denied. It also effectively ruled in favour of the Orange Free State. A furore resulted, as accusations were leveled that Stockenstr√∂m was biased, and sympathetic towards the Orange Free State President Johannes Brand. A form of resolution eventually came about in July 1876, when Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, at that time secretary of state for the colonies, granted the Free State payment \\"in full satisfaction of all claims which it considers it may possess to Griqualand West.\\"Theal G.: History of South Africa from 1873 to 1884, Twelve eventful Years. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd. 1919. In the opinion of Dr Theal, who has written the history of the Boer Republics and has been a consistent supporter of the Boers, the annexation of Griqualand West was probably in the best interests of the Orange Free State. \\"There was,\\" he states, \\"no alternative from British sovereignty other than an independent diamond field republic.\\" At this time, largely owing to the exhausting struggle with the Basutos, the Free State Boers, like their Transvaal Republic neighbours, had drifted into financial straits. A paper currency had been instituted, and the notes, known as \\"bluebacks\\", soon dropped to less than half their nominal value. Commerce was largely carried on by barter, and many cases of bankruptcy occurred in the state. But as British annexation in 1877 saved the Transvaal from bankruptcy, so did the influx of British and other immigrants to the diamond fields, in the early 1870s, restore public credit and individual prosperity to the Boers of the Free State. The diamond fields offered a ready market for stock and other agricultural produce. Money flowed into the pockets of the farmers. Public credit was restored. \\" Bluebacks \\" recovered par value, and were called in and redeemed by the government. Valuable diamond mines were also discovered within the Orange Free State, of which the one at Jagersfontein is the richest. Capital from Kimberley and London was soon provided with which to work them. =Pressure on the Cape Colony to annex the territory= After annexing Griqualand West, the British initially attempted to incorporate it into the Cape Colony, and put significant pressure on the Cape Government to annex it. The new Prime Minister of the Cape, John Molteno refused, citing the enormous public debt of the territory, as well as objections from portions of the indigenous and settler communities of Griqualand. Local control continued to pass increasingly from the Griqua kaptijns into the hands of the growing digger community of the diamond fields. The prospect of complete dis- empowerment in a \\"Diamond Fields Republic\\" became a significant concern of the remaining Griqua. Under pressure, the embattled Griqua leader Nicolaas Waterboer send a formal request to the Cape Government to request incorporation; a request that coincided with renewed pressure on the Cape Government to agree to the union. Union with Cape Colony (1880) Flag of the Cape Colony from 1875-1910 The Griqua Kaptein Nicolaas Waterboer. On being presented with a request from Nicholas Waterboer for union with the Cape Colony, there had begun a protracted debate over whether Griqualand West should be joined to the Cape in a confederation, or whether it should be annexed to the Cape Colony in a total union. The former view was supported by Lord Carnarvon and the British Colonial Office in London - as a first step to bringing all of southern Africa into a British-ruled confederation.Illustrated History of South Africa. The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. . p.182, \\"Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun\\" The latter view was put forward by the Cape Parliament, particularly by its strong-willed Prime Minister John Molteno, who had initially opposed any form of union with the unstable and heavily indebted territory, and now demanded evidence from Britain that the local population would be consulted in the process.M. Mbenga: New History of South Africa. Tafelberg, South Africa. 2007. Suspicious of British motives, in 1876 he travelled to London as plenipotentiary to make the case that union was the only viable way that the Cape could administer the divided and underdeveloped territory, and that a lop-sided confederation would be neither economically viable, nor politically stable. In short, Griqualand West should either be united with the Cape, or kept totally independent from it. After striking a deal with the Home Government and receiving assurances that local objections had been appeased, he passed the Griqualand West Annexation Act on 27 July 1877.Roberts, Brian. 1976. Kimberley, turbulent city. Cape Town: David Philip, p. 155. The act specified that Griqualand West would have the right to elect four representatives to the Cape parliament, two for Kimberley and two for the Barkly West region. This number was doubled in 1882 (Act 39 of 1882). The Cape Government also enforced its non-racial system of Cape Qualified Franchise. This meant that all resident males could qualify for the vote, with the property-ownership qualifications for suffrage applied equally, regardless of race. This was welcomed by the Griqua, but rejected by the recently arrived diggers of the Kimberley diamond fields.L Waldman: The Griqua Conundrum: Political and Socio-Cultural Identity in the Northern Cape, South Africa. Oxford. 2007. In the judiciary, the local Griqua attorney- general reported to the Cape Supreme Court, which got concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court of Griqualand West in the territory.Northern Cape High Court Kimberley] by Lizanne van Niekerk, Northern Cape Bar The implementation of the act was set for 18 October 1880, when Griqualand West was formally united with the Cape Colony, followed soon afterwards by Griqualand East. Current Today, Basters are a separate ethnic group of similarly mixed origins living in south-central Namibia; Northern Cape at Campbell and Griquatown; (the historic territory of Griqualand West); the Western Cape (around the small le Fleur Griqua settlement at Kranshoek); and at Kokstad. The total Griqua population is unknown. The people were submerged by several factors. The most important factor were the racist policies of the Apartheid era, during which many of the Griqua people took on the mantle of \\"Coloured\\" fearing that their Griqua roots might place them at a lower level with the Africans. Genetic evidence indicates that the majority of the present Griqua population is descended from European, Khoikhoi and Tswana ancestors, with a small percentage of Bushman ancestry.Nigel Penn. 2005.

The cereal was introduced to the United States in 1955. It is made primarily from grains like lightly toasted rice, wheat and barley. Special K used to be marketed primarily as a low-fat cereal that can be eaten to help one lose weight.  Special K Challenge  The Special K brand previously advocated the \\"Special K Challenge.\\" The goal of this challenge was to help an individual lose six pounds in two weeks; this loss was achieved by eating specific Special K products throughout the day. The diet began with a single serving of any Special K cereal, accompanied with 2/3 cup of skim milk and a side of fruit. The second meal of the diet included either a Special K Protein Meal Bar, Special K Protein Shake, or another serving of Special K cereal with 2/3 cup of skim milk and a side of fruit. The third meal of the day could be consumed normally, without any Special K restrictions. Throughout the day, an individual is allotted two Special K snacking times, eating any of the following specified snacks: Special K Protein Meal Bars, Special K Protein Shakes, Special K Breakfast Shakes, Special K Protein Granola Bars, Special K Crackers, Special K Cracker Chips, or Special K Popcorn. For any additional snack servings, an individual could consume fruits and vegetables. During the challenge, drinks could be consumed normally. Critics of the Special K diet feel that it may leave dieters feeling hungry because of its limited food options and deter people from sticking to the diet. The diet has been criticised for being too low in protein, fiber, vegetables, and fruits. The diet does not include guidance on how to change unhealthy overeating or lack of exercise and their importance to permanent weight loss. Nutrition In the United States, Special K Original has 120 Cal per 31g cup serving. One serving contains 0.5g fat, 23g carbohydrates, 4g sugar, and 6g protein. In the United Kingdom, Special K Original is 17% sugar, meaning a 30g serving contains 5g of sugar. In the UK, an advertising campaign has focused on the results of a study run in collaboration with the Department of Human Sciences at Loughborough University, requiring overweight volunteer subjects to replace two meals a day with a bowl of the cereal. The study found that after 2 weeks, up to 75% of subjects had slimmer waists and hips. The university's scientists concluded that the majority of this was due to fat loss. Varieties In the US, Special K cereal currently comes in fifteen different varieties: Original, Chocolatey Delight, Chocolatey Strawberry, Cinnamon Pecan, Red Berries, Vanilla Almond, Fruit & Yogurt, Brown Sugar Gluten Free, Oats & Honey, Touch of Honey Granola, Chocolate Almond, Cranberry Granola, Protein, Cinnamon Brown Sugar Crunch Protein, Blueberry Lemon, and Apple Cinnamon Crunch (Seasonal). In the UK & Ireland, Special K cereal comes in ten different varieties: Original, Red Berries, Hazelnut & Almond, Milk Chocolate, Strawberry and Chocolate, Fruit & Nut, Creamy Berry Crunch, Peach & Apricot, and Yoghurty. Ingredients Ingredients in Special k: Rice, wheat gluten, sugar, defatted wheat germ, contains 2% or less of salt, malt flavor. Vitamins and Minerals: Reduced iron, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), niacinamide, vitamin E acetate, beta-carotene, folic acid, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride), vitamin B1 (thiamin hydrochloride), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin D3, vitamin B12. Meal replacement In the US, Special K provides meal replacements in two different forms, protein meal bars and protein shakes. There are eleven varieties of Special K Protein Meal Bars: Mocha Crunch Protein, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Strawberry, Double Chocolate, Chocolatey Chip, Honey Almond, Cranberry Walnut, Chocolate Caramel, Chocolatey Brownie, and Chocolatey Dipped Mint. There are eight varieties of Special K Protein Shakes: Milk Chocolate, Strawberry, French Vanilla, Rich Chocolate, Strawberry Banana, Chocolate Mocha, Vanilla Cappuccino, and Raspberry Cheesecake. Snacks Kellogg's Special K snacks are marketed as low-fat alternatives to regular snacks. There are several varieties of Special K snacks, including Special K Protein Granola Bars, Special K Breakfast Shakes, Special K Cereal Bars, Special K CrackerChips, Special K Popcorn, and Special K Crackers. There are four varieties of Special K Protein Granola Bars: Chocolatey Peanut Butter, Dark Chocolate, Greek Yogurt & Fruit, and Almond Honey Oat. There are five varieties of Special K Breakfast Shakes: Chocolate Mocha Coffee House, Vanilla Cappuccino Coffee House, Chocolate Delight, Red Berries, and French Vanilla. There are two varieties of Special K Cereal Bars: Red Berries, and Chocolatey Pretzel. There are five varieties of Special K Cracker Chips: Sea Salt, Cheddar, Sour Cream & Onion, Barbecue, and Salt & Vinegar. There are two varieties of Special K Popcorn: Kettle Corn and White Cheddar. There is one variety of Special K Crackers: Multi-grain. Beverages =Special K2O Protein Water= Kellogg's Special K2O Protein Water was a beverage released in September 2006 by the Kellogg Company. It was produced in several flavors and has been marketed as a weight-control and weight-loss product. The product was re-launched in 2007 by the Kellogg Company. The product is no longer available. Special K2O Protein Water was available in several flavors, including Strawberry Kiwi,Protein water mix.(New PRODUCTS)  HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared Lemon Twist, and Tropical Blend. Marketed as a low-calorie alternative protein drink, a 16-ounce bottle of K2O contains 5 grams of protein, 10% DV of calcium, and 50 calories. The product has also been marketed as a weight-loss product,Russell, Edward (2010). The Fundamentals of Marketing. AVA Publishing. p. 75. and has been marketed as part of \\"The Special K Challenge\\" and \\"Feeling good never looked better\\" advertising campaigns.Carilli, Theresa; Campbell, Jane (2012). Challenging Images of Women in the Media: Reinventing Women's Lives. Lexington Books. p. 4. On August 15, 2007, Kellogg's re-launched Special K2O Protein Water with enhanced graphics and a new flavor, Mixed Berry. In addition to the 5 grams of protein, the product was formulated with 5 grams of soluble fiber, from polydextrose, and 20% DV each of vitamins B3 (Niacin), B6, and B12 while maintaining 50 calories. The product was also manufactured in a powdered form as a drink mix that is sold in packets, which is then added to water. The powdered product has 30 calories,Lluc, Alex A. (2008). The Complete Calorie Fat & Carb Counter. WS Publishing Group. p. 407. 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. The powdered mix has also been marketed as a weight- control product.Cardello, Hank; Garr, Garr (2009). Stuffed: An Insider's Look at Who's (Really) Making America Fat. HarperCollins. p. 203. =Special K Protein Shakes= Kellogg's produces Special K Protein Shakes. Controversies = Canada = Until mid-2014, Kellogg's used a special Special K formula that was different in Canada from that used in the U.S. With the June 2014 closure of Kellogg's London, Ontario plant, Canadians now eat Special K that is made in the U.S. This formulation was similar to the original Special K introduced in the US in 1955. The discontinued Canadian formula had a different taste which reflected the \\"Canadian taste preference\\" (according to the Consumer Relations department of Kellogg's in Canada). The Canadian formula included rice, wheat gluten, sugar/glucose-fructose, defatted wheat germ, salt, malt (corn flour, malted barley), vitamins (thiamin hydrochloride, niacinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, folic acid, d-calcium pantothenate), iron, and BHT added to the package material to maintain product freshness. In September 2015, Special K launched a new advertising campaign with the slogan \\"Own It\\" during the Emmy Awards broadcast. Kellogg wants Special K's message to be about self-empowerment, rather than counting calories. Discussing how Canadian women's approach to health management has changed, Natasha Millar of Kellogg Canada said: \\"Her stance on diet is not about starvation or calorie-counting ‚Ä¶ her benchmark is achievement. Skinny is not how she wants to be perceived, but rather, strong. It's not about losing weight, it's about working out and building her sense of self. And while her stance on body image was at one point about looking good, now it‚Äôs about feeling good.\\" = Denmark = Denmark has outlawed the addition of vitamins in Kellogg's products since 2004. Danish health officials banned cereals containing added vitamins because they claimed Kellogg's Special K wanted to add extremely high levels of vitamin B6, calcium, folic acid, and iron, which would reach toxic levels when eaten on a daily basis. Young children risk liver and kidney damage while the fetuses of pregnant women could suffer complications. = The Netherlands = In an episode aired on October 15, 2009, the Dutch television show ', followed up one of Kellogg's Special K nutritional claims, namely the addition of iron. The show provided evidence that the iron was not nutritional ionic iron‚Äîas it occurs in natural foods like spinach‚Äîbut was, in fact, metallic iron. A Kellogg's telephone help desk employee was not willing to discuss the ingredients of their products in general, claiming it was a company secret; although, in the show, the company was not confronted with the findings. The nutritional experts in the show agreed that metallic iron should not be part of a diet. Metallic iron is speculated to damage organs. After the airing, the Dutch food authority nuanced the claims made in the TV program, claiming there are no health risks. They also challenged the claim that the cereal could contain \\"shredded bites,\\" and responded that iron powder is suitable for human consumption. The evidence provided during the show followed David Catz's description of an experiment by Dr. Babu George, Sacred Heart University, in which iron is extracted from cereals. The description dates from 1984. As a result of this experiment being published and inquiries being made to the manufacturers, some companies have replaced the metallic iron in their products with an iron compound such as iron (III) phosphate, ferric phosphate. = United Kingdom = In May 2013, shoppers disapproved of the altered Special K formula, complaining that the cereal's flakes are too hard. The reason behind the extra crunch is the additional ingredient, barley. Kellogg shoppers also complained that the cereal has become too sugary. The company assures that the sugar content has remained the same (17%), the difference is that some of the sugar is baked on the outside of the flake, giving an added crunch. = United States = In late February 2013, the company announced on its website that it was recalling three sizes of the Special K Red Berries in the US which might contain pieces of glass.

By extension, the phrase \\"the etymology of [a word]\\" means the origin of a particular word. For languages with a long written history, etymologists make use of texts, and texts about the language, to gather knowledge about how words were used during earlier periods, how they developed in meaning and form, or when and how they entered the language. Etymologists also apply the methods of comparative linguistics to reconstruct information about forms that are too old for any direct information to be available. By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the comparative method, linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In this way, word roots in European languages, for example, can be traced all the way back to the origin of the Indo-European language family. Even though etymological research originally grew from the philological tradition, much current etymological research is done on language families where little or no early documentation is available, such as Uralic and Austronesian. The word etymology derives from the Greek word (), itself from (), meaning \\"true sense or sense of a truth\\", and the suffix -logia, denoting \\"the study of\\"., . The term etymon refers to a word or morpheme (e.g., stemAccording to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the ultimate etymon of the English word machine is the Proto-Indo-European stem *mƒÅgh \\"be able to\\", see p. 174, or rootAccording to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the co-etymon of the Israeli word glida \\"ice cream\\" is the Hebrew root gld \\"clot\\", see p. 132, ) from which a later word or morpheme derives. For example, the Latin word candidus, which means \\"white\\", is the etymon of English candid. Relationships are often less transparent, however. English place names such as Winchester, Gloucester, Tadcaster share in different modern forms a suffixed etymon that was once meaningful, Latin castrum 'fort'. Diagram showing relationships between etymologically related words Methods Etymologists apply a number of methods to study the origins of words, some of which are: * Philological research. Changes in the form and meaning of the word can be traced with the aid of older texts, if such are available. * Making use of dialectological data. The form or meaning of the word might show variations between dialects, which may yield clues about its earlier history. * The comparative method. By a systematic comparison of related languages, etymologists may often be able to detect which words derive from their common ancestor language and which were instead later borrowed from another language. * The study of semantic change. Etymologists must often make hypotheses about changes in the meaning of particular words. Such hypotheses are tested against the general knowledge of semantic shifts. For example, the assumption of a particular change of meaning may be substantiated by showing that the same type of change has occurred in other languages as well.  Types of word origins  Etymological theory recognizes that words originate through a limited number of basic mechanisms, the most important of which are language change, borrowing (i.e., the adoption of \\"loanwords\\" from other languages); word formation such as derivation and compounding; and onomatopoeia and sound symbolism (i.e., the creation of imitative words such as \\"click\\" or \\"grunt\\"). While the origin of newly emerged words is often more or less transparent, it tends to become obscured through time due to sound change or semantic change. Due to sound change, it is not readily obvious that the English word set is related to the word sit (the former is originally a causative formation of the latter). It is even less obvious that bless is related to blood (the former was originally a derivative with the meaning \\"to mark with blood\\"). Semantic change may also occur. For example, the English word bead originally meant \\"prayer\\". It acquired its modern meaning through the practice of counting the recitation of prayers by using beads.  English language  English derives from Old English (sometimes referred to as Anglo-Saxon), a West Germanic variety, although its current vocabulary includes words from many languages.The American educator: a library of universal knowledge ..., Volume 3 By Charles Smith Morris, Amos Emerson Dolbear The Old English roots may be seen in the similarity of numbers in English and German, particularly seven/sieben, eight/acht, nine/neun, and ten/zehn. Pronouns are also cognate: I/mine/me and ich/mein/mich; thou/thine/thee and du/dein/dich; we/wir and us/uns; she/sie; your/ihr. '' However, language change has eroded many grammatical elements, such as the noun case system, which is greatly simplified in modern English. Certain elements of vocabulary are borrowed from French and other Romance languages, but most of the common words used in English are of Germanic origin. When the Normans conquered England in 1066 (see Norman Conquest), they brought their Norman language with them. During the Anglo-Norman period, which united insular and continental territories, the ruling class spoke Anglo-Norman, while the peasants spoke the vernacular English of the time. Anglo-Norman was the conduit for the introduction of French into England, aided by the circulation of Langue d'o√Øl literature from France. This led to many paired words of French and English origin. For example, beef is related, through borrowing, to modern French b≈ìuf, veal to , pork to , and poultry to . All these words, French and English, refer to the meat rather than to the animal. Words that refer to farm animals, on the other hand, tend to be cognates of words in other Germanic languages. For example, swine/Schwein, cow/Kuh, calf/Kalb, and sheep/Schaf. The variant usage has been explained by the proposition that it was the Norman rulers who mostly ate meat (an expensive commodity) and the Anglo-Saxons who farmed the animals. This explanation has passed into common folklore but has been disputed. = Assimilation of foreign words = English has proved accommodating to words from many languages. Scientific terminology, for example, relies heavily on words of Latin and Greek origin, but there are a great many non-scientific examples. Spanish has contributed many words, particularly in the southwestern United States. Examples include , , , , and states' names such as and . , , , , and from Portuguese; and prima donna from Italian. Modern French has contributed , , , and many more. , , and are from Swedish, Norwegian and Danish; from Finnish; , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and from Arabic (often via other languages); , , , , and from Hebrew; , , , and from Russian. , , , , , and come from Urdu, Hindi and ultimately Sanskrit; from Tamil; , , and from Japanese; , , , and from Cantonese. and are from Malay; and boondocks from the Tagalog word for hills or mountains, . derives from one or more South-East Asia and East Indies words for fish sauce or soy sauce, likely by way of Chinese, though the precise path is unclear: Malay , Indonesian , Chinese Min Nan k√™-chiap and cognates in other Chinese dialects. Surprisingly few loanwords, however, come from other languages native to the British Isles. Those that exist include , and (probably) , and from Welsh; and from Scottish Gaelic; , , and from Irish; and and from Scots (or related Northern English dialects). Many Canadian English and American English words (especially but not exclusively plant and animal names) are loanwords from Indigenous American languages, such as , , , , , , , , , , , , and .  History  The search for meaningful origins for familiar or strange words is far older than the modern understanding of linguistic evolution and the relationships of languages, which began no earlier than the 18th century. From Antiquity through the 17th century, from to Pindar to Sir Thomas Browne, etymology had been a form of witty wordplay, in which the supposed origins of words were creatively imagined to satisfy contemporary requirements; for example, the Greek poet Pindar (born in approximately 522 BCE) employed inventive etymologies to flatter his patrons. Plutarch employed etymologies insecurely based on fancied resemblances in sounds. Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae was an encyclopedic tracing of \\"first things\\" that remained uncritically in use in Europe until the sixteenth century. Etymologicum genuinum is a grammatical encyclopedia edited at Constantinople in the ninth century, one of several similar Byzantine works. The thirteenth-century Legenda Aurea, as written by Jacobus de Vorgagine, begins each vita of a saint with a fanciful excursus in the form of an etymology. =Ancient Sanskrit= The Sanskrit linguists and grammarians of ancient India were the first to make a comprehensive analysis of linguistics and etymology. The study of Sanskrit etymology has provided Western scholars with the basis of historical linguistics and modern etymology. Four of the most famous Sanskrit linguists are: * Yaska (c. 6th‚Äì5th centuries BCE) * (c. 520‚Äì460 BCE) * (2nd century BCE) * (2nd century BCE) These linguists were not the earliest Sanskrit grammarians, however. They followed a line of ancient grammarians of Sanskrit who lived several centuries earlier like Sakatayana of whom very little is known. The earliest of attested etymologies can be found in Vedic literature in the philosophical explanations of the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads. The analyses of Sanskrit grammar done by the previously mentioned linguists involved extensive studies on the etymology (called Nirukta or Vyutpatti in Sanskrit) of Sanskrit words, because the ancient Indo-Aryans considered sound and speech itself to be sacred and, for them, the words of the sacred Vedas contained deep encoding of the mysteries of the soul and God. =Ancient Greco-Roman= One of the earliest philosophical texts of the Classical Greek period to address etymology was the Socratic dialogue Cratylus (c. 360 BCE) by Plato. During much of the dialogue, Socrates makes guesses as to the origins of many words, including the names of the gods. In his Odes Pindar spins complimentary etymologies to flatter his patrons. Plutarch (Life of Numa Pompilius) spins an etymology for pontifex, while explicitly dismissing the obvious, and actual \\"bridge-builder\\": > the priests, called Pontifices.... have the name of Pontifices from potens, > powerful, because they attend the service of the gods, who have power and > command over all. Others make the word refer to exceptions of impossible > cases; the priests were to perform all the duties possible to them; if > anything lay beyond their power, the exception was not to be cavilled at. > The most common opinion is the most absurd, which derives this word from > pons, and assigns the priests the title of bridge-makers. The sacrifices > performed on the bridge were amongst the most sacred and ancient, and the > keeping and repairing of the bridge attached, like any other public sacred > office, to the priesthood. =Medieval= Isidore of Seville compiled a volume of etymologies to illuminate the triumph of religion. Each saint's legend in Jacob de Voragine's Legenda Aurea begins with an etymological discourse on the saint's name: > Lucy is said of light, and light is beauty in beholding, after that S. > Ambrose saith: The nature of light is such, she is gracious in beholding, > she spreadeth over all without lying down, she passeth in going right > without crooking by right long line; and it is without dilation of tarrying, > and therefore it is showed the blessed Lucy hath beauty of virginity without > any corruption; essence of charity without disordinate love; rightful going > and devotion to God, without squaring out of the way; right long line by > continual work without negligence of slothful tarrying. In Lucy is said, the > way of light.Medieval Sourcebook: The Golden Legend: Volume 2 (full text) =Modern era= Etymology in the modern sense emerged in the late 18th- century European academia, within the context of the wider \\"Age of Enlightenment,\\" although preceded by 17th century pioneers such as Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn, Gerardus Vossius, Stephen Skinner, Elisha Coles, and William Wotton. The first known systematic attempt to prove the relationship between two languages on the basis of similarity of grammar and lexicon was made in 1770 by the Hungarian, J√°nos Sajnovics, when he attempted to demonstrate the relationship between Sami and Hungarian (work that was later extended to the whole Finno-Ugric language family in 1799 by his fellow countryman, Samuel Gyarmathi).Szemer√©nyi 1996:6 The origin of modern historical linguistics is often traced to Sir William Jones, a Welsh philologist living in India, who in 1782 observed the genetic relationship between Sanskrit, Greek and Latin. Jones published his The Sanscrit Language in 1786, laying the foundation for the field of Indo-European linguistics. The study of etymology in Germanic philology was introduced by Rasmus Christian Rask in the early 19th century and elevated to a high standard with the German Dictionary of the Brothers Grimm. The successes of the comparative approach culminated in the Neogrammarian school of the late 19th century. Still in the 19th century, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche used etymological strategies (principally and most famously in On the Genealogy of Morals, but also elsewhere) to argue that moral values have definite historical (specifically, cultural) origins where modulations in meaning regarding certain concepts (such as \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\") show how these ideas had changed over time‚Äîaccording to which value-system appropriated them. This strategy gained popularity in the 20th century, and philosophers, such as Jacques Derrida, have used etymologies to indicate former meanings of words to de- center the \\"violent hierarchies\\" of Western philosophy.

On March 28, 2020, See's Candies suspended operations citing the current COVID-19 pandemic and stating it has closed all of its stores until further notice. This is the first time the company has shut down operations since WWII, when it became difficult to acquire sugar and other ingredients due to the war effort.. In May 2020, See's Candies reopened both their Los Angeles and San Francisco candy kitchens with safety precautions in-place. On-line sales resumed and contact-free pick-up became available in certain locations. History Sunnyvale, California According to the corporate website, Charles Alexander See II (1882‚Äì1949) arrived in the United States from Canada in 1921See's Candies website with his wife Florence MacLean Wilson See (1885‚Äì1956), and his widowed mother Mary Wiseman See (1854‚Äì1939). Mary See had developed the recipes that became the foundation of the See's candy business while helping run her husband's hotel on Tremont Island in Ontario.Mary Wiseman See, Find A Grave. The family opened the first See's Candies shop and kitchen at 135 North Western Avenue in Los Angeles in November 1921. They leased the shop from the French Canadian pioneer of Los Angeles, Amable Lamer.Re: Lamer Stuff. ancestry.com They had twelve shops by the mid-1920s and operated thirty shops during the Great Depression. See's first white and black \\"all porcelain\\" store was opened in Bakersfield, California on May 1, 1941.Bakersfield Californian, April 10, 1941, Page 12, \\"first all-porcelain store\\" In 1936 See's opened a shop in San Francisco. It moved operations to make creams and truffles (60% of product sales) to South San Francisco in order to take advantage of the location's cool weather. In 1972, the See family sold the company, which generated $4 million in pre-tax profit that year, to Berkshire Hathaway for $25 million. On January 3, 1972, Blue Chip obtained a controlling interest in See's Candy Shops. Blue Chip later acquired 100% of See's for an overall price of $25 million. Wesco Financial Corporation was an 80.1% owned subsidiary of Blue Chip Stamps until its complete merger into Berkshire Hathaway in 2011. Warren Buffett has called See's \\"the prototype of a dream business.\\" (2007)Peter Bevelin (2012). A Few Lessons for Investors and Managers from Warren E. Buffett. PCA Publishing and Intermountain Books. At a 1996 luncheon in San Francisco, Charlie Munger revealed that See's was the first high quality business that Berkshire ever bought. Previous to that point, Berkshire had focused on undervalued assets that could be bought cheaply. The See's acquisition influenced their commitment to buying businesses with a strong reputation and brand recognition. The 'couverture' chocolate used by See's is provided by the nearby Guittard Chocolate Company, and nuts come from Mariani Nut Company of Winters, California, just about an hour and 20 minutes away.

In popular culture  In 1952, Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance spent a half day at the See's Candies store on La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, learning to dip chocolates and work the production line, in preparation for the \\"Job Switching\\" episode of I Love Lucy. The episode, which featured Lucy and Ethel getting jobs in a chocolate factory, became one of the most popular in the show's history.

Design Pod is designed to be a simple, clean language with just enough syntax to be useful. It purposefully does not include mechanisms for fonts, images, colors or tables. Some of its goals are: * Easy to parse * Easy to convert to other formats, such as XML, TeX or Markdown * Easy to incorporate sample code * Easy to read without a pod formatter (i.e. in its source-code form) * Easy to write in An extended version of pod that supports tables and footnotes called PseudoPOD has been used by O'Reilly & Associates to produce several Perl books, most notably Programming Perl by Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, and Jon Orwant. Pod makes it easy to write manual pages, which are well suited to user-oriented documents. In contrast, other documentation systems, such as Python's Docstring or Java's Javadoc, though they can be used for user documentation, are designed to facilitate generating developer-oriented documentation about the source code for a software project. Use Pod is the language used for most documentation in the Perl world. This includes Perl itself, nearly all publicly released modules, many scripts, most design documents, many articles on Perl.com and other Perl-related web sites, and the Parrot virtual machine. Pod is rarely read in the raw, although it is designed to be readable without the assistance of a formatting tool. Instead, it is read with the perldoc tool, or converted into Unix man pages or Web-standard HTML pages. It is also possible to use pod in other contexts than Perl. For example, to add simple documentation to bash scripts, which can then be easily converted to man pages.Embedding POD documentation in a shell script (retrieved 10 Jan 2011) Such uses rely on language-specific hacks to hide the pod part(s), such as (in bash) prefixing the POD section with the line \`:<<=cut\` which works by calling bash's no-op \`:\` command, with the whole block of Pod as a here document as input to it. Pure pod files usually have the extension \`.pod\`, but pod is mostly used directly in Perl code, which typically uses the \`.pl\` and \`.pm\` extensions. (The Perl interpreter's parser is designed to ignore pod in Perl code.) In source code files, the documentation is generally placed after the \`__END__\` marker (which also helps syntax highlighting in some editors to display it as comments). Pod can easily be converted to other formats, for example some of the various Wiki formats like: WikiWikiWeb, Kwiki, TWiki, UseModWiki, TiddlyWiki, Textile, MediaWiki, MoinMoin or Confluence using Pod::Simple::Wiki. Example This document is syntactically correct pod, which attempts to follow the major conventions on section naming as well. Formatting details Pod files are written in an ASCII-compatible encoding, such as Latin-1 or UTF-8. A pod parser always assumes that the file it is parsing doesn't start with pod; it ignores all lines until it sees a pod directive. pod directives must come at the beginning of a line, and all begin with an equal sign. The pod parser will then assume that all following lines are pod, until it encounters a line consisting of the \\"=cut\\" directive. Any content following that is ignored until the parser encounters another pod directive. Thus, pod can be intermixed with executable source code if the language's parser knows how to recognize and ignore pod. Pod content is divided into paragraphs by empty lines. Paragraphs that begin with whitespace characters‚Äîtabs or spaces‚Äîare considered to be \\"verbatim paragraphs\\", and are left completely unformatted; these are used for sample code, ASCII art, etc. Paragraphs that begin with an equal sign are \\"command paragraphs\\"; the sequence of alphanumeric characters immediately following the equal sign is treated as a pod directive, and the rest of the paragraph is formatted according to that directive. Some directives also affect the following paragraphs. If a paragraph starts with something besides an equal sign or whitespace, it's considered an \\"ordinary paragraph\\". Both ordinary paragraphs and the contents of command paragraphs are parsed for formatting codes. Formatting in pod is very plain; it's mainly limited to bold, italic, underlined, monospaced, and a few other formats. There is also a code for linking between pod documents or to another section within the same document. Formatting codes consist of either: * A single uppercase letter, followed by a less-than sign (<), the content to be formatted, and a greater-than sign (>), e.g. \`B\`, or * A single uppercase letter, two or more less-than signs (<<), a space, the content to be formatted, another space, and the same number of greater-than signs as were used before, e.g. \`B<< bolded text >>\`. This form is often used for code snippets containing a greater-than sign, which would otherwise end the formatting code. Commands in pod include four levels of headings, bulleted and numbered lists, and commands to mark sections as being in another language. The latter feature allows for special formatting to be given to parsers that support it.

It was founded in 1960, as Teledyne, Inc., by Henry Singleton and George Kozmetsky. From August 1996 to November 1999, Teledyne existed as part of the conglomerate Allegheny Teledyne Incorporated ‚Äì a combination of the former Teledyne, Inc., and the former Allegheny Ludlum Corporation.Allegheny Technologies Incorporated. Our History On November 29, 1999, three separate entities, Teledyne Technologies, Allegheny Technologies, and Water Pik Technologies, were spun off as free-standing public companies. Allegheny Technologies retained several companies of the former Teledyne, Inc. that fit with Allegheny's core business of steel and exotic metals production. At various times, Teledyne, Inc., had more than 150 companies with interests as varied as insurance, dental appliances, specialty metals, and aerospace electronics, but many of these had been divested prior to the merger with Allegheny. The new Teledyne Technologies was initially composed of 19 companies that were earlier in Teledyne, Inc. By 2011, Teledyne Technologies had grown to include nearly 100 companies. Segments Teledyne Technologies currently operates with four major segments: Digital Imaging, Instrumentation, Engineered Systems, and Aerospace and Defense Electronics.Teledyne, 2010 Annual Report =Digital imaging= Near-infrared detector produced by Teledyne Scientific & Imaging, a Teledyne Technologies company. This segment handles sponsored and central research laboratories for a range of new technologies, as well as development and production efforts in digital imaging products for government applications. Included are infrared detectors, cameras, and opto-mechanical assemblies. =Instrumentation= This segment provides monitoring and control instruments for marine, environmental, scientific, industrial, and defense applications as well as harsh environment interconnect products. =Engineered systems= This segment provides systems engineering and integration, advanced technology application, software development, and manufacturing solutions to space, military, environmental, energy, chemical, biological and nuclear systems, and missile defense requirements. It also designs and manufactures hydrogen gas generators, thermoelectric and fuel-based power sources, and small turbine engines. =Aerospace and defense electronics= This segment provides complex electronic components and subsystems for communication products, including defense electronics, data acquisition and communications equipment for air transport and business aircraft, and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications, as well as general aviation batteries.

Arthur Rock, one of America's first and most successful venture capitalists, financed the startup with a $450,000 investment. Their basic plan was to build a major firm centering on microelectronics and control system development, primarily through acquiring existing companies. =Early years= In October 1960, the first acquisition was made by purchasing the majority of stock in Amelco, a small electronics manufacturing plant. Within a short time, rights to the name Teledyne and its associated logo were bought. In addition to Amelco, two other electronics manufacturing firms were acquired, and by the end of 1960, Teledyne had about 400 employees and 80,000 square feet (7,400 m2) of floor space devoted to engineering development and manufacturing. Teledyne stock was first offered to the public in May 1961. During its first full fiscal year of operations ending in October 1961, Teledyne had sales of $4,491,000 with a net income of $58,000.Much of the information in this section was taken from the following: Roberts, George A.; ‚ÄúThe Beginnings‚Äù (pp. 9-16) and ‚ÄúEarly Acquisitions‚Äù (pp.17-126) in Distant Force; A Memoir of the Teledyne Corporation and the Man Who Created It, Meglin Marketing Communications, 2007 () Teledyne‚Äôs growth continued in 1962, with the acquisition of companies primarily through equity agreements. Internally, Teledyne Systems was formed as the centerpiece of the firm‚Äôs aerospace systems business, diversifying the business base into government contracts with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). By the end of the second fiscal year, Teledyne sales had increased 230 percent and net income by about 570 percent.Roberts, Op. cit., Appendix, 1962 Financial Summary Over the next three years, new companies were acquired in microwave and power electrical products ‚Äì including the first consumer products. Teledyne Controls was established, moving the Company into the field of hydraulics. Teledyne entered the optics field with the acquisition of Kiernan Optics, producing windows for the Apollo spacecraft and infrared optical domes for missiles. In early 1965, Teledyne had a major breakthrough in winning a large contract from the U.S. Navy for the Integrated Helicopter Avionics System (IHAS), giving Teledyne a name in the military market. This caused a major jump in the stock price, from $15 to $65. By the end of the fiscal year, Teledyne had acquired 34 companies, sales were $86.5 million with net income of $3.4 million, there were about 5,400 employees, assets reached $66.5 million, and there were near 8 million outstanding shares of stock.Roberts, Op. cit.; Appendix, 1961-1965 Financial Summary =Major growth years= A new era for Teledyne started in 1966. In June, Kozmetsky left to become dean of the School of Business Administration at the University of Texas. In July, Vanadium-Alloy Steel Company (Vasco), including its subsidiary Allvac, was merged into Teledyne. This expanded the company into the Eastern U.S. and started the formation of material technologies as a major business activity of Teledyne. With the merger, Singleton turned his position of President over to George A. Roberts, a close friend from Naval Academy days, who had headed Vasco. Singleton, now assisted by Roberts, continued in acquiring new companies.Teledyne Historian, vol. 1, Oct. 1972 In 1967, one of the largest of these was Brown Engineering, a firm with about 3,500 employees headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama. With NASA and DoD contracts for engineering services and research, Brown Engineering added a new line of business for Teledyne. Ryan Aeronautical in San Diego, was acquired in 1968. Continental Motors was primarily owned by Ryan, and this acquisition brought Teledyne into the piston-powered engine business with both commercial and military customers. In the remainder of the 1960s, Teledyne acquired some 90 more companies. A number of these businesses were in consumer products, such as Water Pik, Acoustic Research with high-fidelity speakers, and Olson Electronics that operated retail stores across America. Packard Bell Corporation had both consumer and government sales in computers and television receivers. A number of electronic product lines and smaller acquisitions were consolidated in Teledyne Electronics and Teledyne Microelectronic Technologies. Two acquired firms, Geophysical Exploration and Geotronics, brought Teledyne into off-shore drilling and earth-science instrumentation fields. Twenty-one acquired companies were in the metals business, including Wah Chang and Cast Products, and this led to the acquisition of firms producing industrial machines and machine tools. Other diverse acquisitions included Monarch Rubber, Sewart Seacraft, Isotopes, Radar Relays, Getz Dental, and the agreement with Subaru to market Wisconsin engines. Singleton also added a diverse group of financial institutions, giving Teledyne contact and intimacy with the capital world. These included thrift and loan banks and insurance firms dealing with property, workers compensation, casualty, and life insurance. Most of the insurance investments were later consolidated into the Argonaut and Unitrin subsidiaries, and were ultimately spun off as independent companies. Teledyne was divided into Groups, and by the end of the 1960s, there were 16 Groups with 94 profit centers in 120 locations. Company presidents were given considerable freedom in their operations, but Corporate maintained close financial control and capital management. Teledyne sales in 1969 were $2.7 billion and net income was $372 million. The stock had a 2-for-1 split during 1967 and the same split in 1969.Roberts, Op. cit., Appendix, 1966-1970 Financial Summary As Teledyne moved into its second decade, some 150 firms had been acquired. Singleton then essentially stopped direct acquisition of companies and began investments in stock of technical firms. By the end of the second decade, Teledyne owned 31 percent of Curtiss- Wright, 24 percent of Litton, as well as significant portions of a number of other well-known companies. This stock was mainly held by the insurance subsidiaries. In the \\"bear\\" market of the early 1970s, Teledyne stock fell from about $40 to less than $8; Singleton saw this as an opportunity to buy back Teledyne stock. In buybacks from October 1972 to February 1976, 22 million shares were repurchased at $14 to $40 ‚Äì well above the market price. This raised the value of Teledyne stock, eventually increasing to near $175 at the end of the decade.Calandro, Joseph, Jr,; \\"Henry Singleton: a pioneer of corporate strategic leadership and value creation\\", Strategy & Leadership, vol. 38 no: 6, (2010), pp.29‚Äì37 In this period, annual income increased by 89 percent and net income by 315 percent. Stockholders who had remained through the buyback achieved a phenomenal gain of about 3,000 percent.Roberts, Op. cit., Appendix, 1971-1975 and 1976-1980 Financial Summary =Peak and decline= Going into its third decade, Teledyne sales passed the $3 billion mark in 1980, with industrial products leading in both sales and net income. In the race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, government sales reached almost $800 million. The first significant slump in Teledyne business began in 1985. Sales for 1984 had been about $3.49 billion, but decreased to around $3.26 billion the next year and remained essentially flat for the remainder of the decade.Roberts, Op. cit., Appendix, 1981-1985 Financial Summary In April 1986, Singleton, who was then 69 years old, turned the position of CEO over to Roberts, but remained as Board Chairman. During 1988, Teledyne faced a number of legal problems, none of which were the direct result of wrongdoings of Singleton or Roberts. After agreeing to plead guilty to officials in Teledyne Electronics having made false statements, Teledyne was fined $17.5 million. After guiding Teledyne for 29 years, Singleton retired as an employee and officer in April 1989. Nevertheless, that was a peak year for Teledyne sales ($3.53 billion) and earnings ($392 million). Teledyne stock price reached $388.88, the highest in the nation. Total employment also peaked at near 43,000.Roberts, Op. cit., Appendix, 1986-1990 Financial Summary Henry Singleton retired as Teledyne Chairman in 1991, and was replaced by George Roberts; William P. Rutledge was named President and CEO. Roberts then retired in 1993 and was replaced by Rutledge; Donald B. Rice, previously Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, was then named President and CEO. Many companies had been sold during the prior several years, and in 1993, through consolidations, the number was further reduced from 65 to 18. In January 1995, Teledyne Electronic Systems was sold to Litton Industries, essentially ending the business on which Teledyne had originally been formed. In the early 1990s, while the company underwent these turnovers in leadership, two lawsuits were brought against Teledyne by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act. The suits charged the company with falsifying test reports for relay devices sold to the US government for weapons and spacecraft use, and with padding government contract cost estimates.Emil Stache Senate Subcommittee Hearing Phillips & Cohen LLP, 1993. In April 1994, Teledyne settled both cases for $112.5 million, at the time one of the largest settlements by military contractors in a qui tam case. In late 1994, Teledyne was subjected to a hostile takeover attempt by WHX Corporation. This was successfully challenged, but the Teledyne pension fund had a surplus of $928 million and this was of wide interest. To forestall further hostile takeovers, Allegheny Ludlum, a steel and specialty metal firm, offered to serve as a white knight friendly acquirer. On August 15, 1996, an agreement was reached to merge Teledyne with Allegheny Ludlum, forming Allegheny Teledyne, Inc. (ATI), with headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After some reorganization, ATI operated with three segments: Aerospace and Electronics, Specialty Metals, and Consumer Products. The former Teledyne high-technology companies were mainly in the A&E; Segment, led by Robert Mehrabian. ATI eventually decided to spin off the segments into independent entities, and on November 29, 1999, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, and Water Pik Technologies, Inc., were formed.Roberts, Opt. cit., \\"From Merger to Spin-off,\\" pp. 252-256 =Renewal= With Robert Mehrabian as Chairman, CEO, and President, Teledyne Technologies (or simply Teledyne, as it is most often called) was initially composed of 19 companies, all dating (in some form) from the original Teledyne, Inc. There were about 5,800 employees, including some 1,400 engineers and scientists. One of these companies, Ryan Aeronautical, was sold to Northrop Grumman before the end of 1999 to raise initial operating capital. Headquarters was initially in the Century City district of Los Angeles, but was later moved to one of the city's suburbs, Thousand Oaks. The Thousand Oaks location was the site of the Rockwell Scientific Company (formerly Rockwell International Science Center). Teledyne acquired Rockwell Scientific in 2006, and continued doing scientific and industrial research at the site (as Teledyne Scientific Company), in addition to having its corporate offices there. In 2000, its first full year of operation, Teledyne Technologies had sales of $795.1 million and net income of $40.5 million.Teledyne, 2000 Annual Report The renewed Teledyne operated in much the same manner as Singleton‚Äôs early Teledyne, functioning as a conglomerate with growth mainly due to acquisitions. In 2010, the sales were $1,644.2 million with net income of $120.5 million, a cumulative financial growth in the decade of approximately 100 percent. About 44 percent of the 2010 sales were derived from contracts with agencies of, or prime contractors to, the U.S. government. By the start of 2011, there were near 100 companies, functioning in a wide range of products and services. Teledyne reported third quarter 2019 net sales of $802.2 million, a 10.6% increase compared to 2018.

Albums that have been performed include Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II and Led Zeppelin IV, Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run, Supertramp's Crime of the Century and Breakfast in America, the Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main St., Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, Eagles' Hotel California, Guns N' Roses' Appetite for Destruction, Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall and Animals, Queen's A Night at the Opera, and the Beatles albums Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Beatles (AKA the \\"White Album\\"), Abbey Road, and Prince's Purple Rain. In recent years, the series has presented concerts in a variety of cities, including Orlando, Florida, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Akron, La Mirada, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Lakeland, Coral Springs, New York, New Jersey, Dallas, Houston, Uncasville, Connecticut, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Rochester, New York. On December 17, 2006, Classic Albums Live performed the entire 213-song Beatles song catalogue in one 13-hour concert at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto. A different lineup performs each album. There is a group of core musicians who are frequently part of the performances, including Nick Hildyard, Rob Phillips, Lindsay Clark, Leslea Keurvorst, Troy Feener, Clifton David, Dom Polito, Doug Inglis and Marty Morin. Occasionally, more famous Canadian musicians are brought in as well, including Mia Sheard, Kim Bingham, Nicholas Walsh, and ex-members of Moist. In some venues, they will bring in local musicians to fill needed spots. For example, on June 16, 2006, the group performed the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper album at the Hard Rock Live in Orlando; they brought in the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra to fill in on the orchestral parts. When performing in Toronto, they usually play at Massey Hall.http://classicalbumslive.com/ The producer of Classic Albums Live has created a musical called Gig which will run in 2016.http://classicalbumslive.com/ List of albums performed: *The Beatles' catalogue *Led Zeppelin *Led Zeppelin II *Led Zeppelin IV *Houses of the Holy *Physical Graffiti *In Through the Out Door *Meddle *The Dark Side of the Moon *Animals *Wish You Were Here *The Wall *A Night at the Opera *Who's Next *Are You Experienced *Boston *Crime of the Century *Breakfast in America *The Last Waltz *Rust Never Sleeps *Harvest *The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars *OK Computer *Ten *Nevermind *Regatta de Blanc *Outlandos d'Amour *The Joshua Tree *London Calling *Band on the Run *Texas Flood *Let It Bleed *Sticky Fingers *Some Girls *Exile on Main St. *Appetite for Destruction *Highway to Hell *Back in Black *Born to Run *Hotel California *Rumours *The Doors *L.A.

Felicien is the 2003 World champion in the 100 metres hurdles and 2004 World indoor champion in the 60 metres hurdles. She also won silver medals at the 2007 World Championships, the 2010 World Indoor Championships, and twice at the Pan American Games. Her best time for the 100 metres hurdles of 12.46 secs from 2004 still stands as the Canadian record (as of 2018). Early life Born in Oshawa, Ontario, Felicien carries her mother's maiden name, whose origins are in the Caribbean island nation of Saint Lucia. Her mother named her \\"Perdita\\" after a unicorn. Felicien moved to Pickering, Ontario, where, as a student, she began competing in track and field events at her school. She was motivated to join her school's track and field team after receiving an Award of Excellence in the Canada Fitness Award Program in grade 3. At first, she competed in the 100m dash, inspired by Donovan Bailey and Bruny Surin of Canada, later adding the 200m dash and long jump. Felicien dedicated herself to hurdling at Pine Ridge Secondary School and won the Ontario high-school hurdling championship in 1998. That year she added the first of two consecutive Canadian junior championships. Her performance at a scholastic meet in Ohio brought offers of athletic scholarships from a number of U.S. universities from which she chose the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign where she enrolled in the study of kinesiology. Career Coached by Gary Winckler, in her first year competing at the university level, Felicien earned All-American honors and in the 100m hurdles set the record for the fastest time by a freshman in NCAA history for the event. The following year she was ranked No. 1 in the 100 m hurdles by the NCAA for the entire outdoor season and was the first Illinois athlete to ever win a national championship during both the indoor and outdoor seasons. Her performance earned her the first of three consecutive University of Illinois Female Athlete of the Year awards and she was voted the U.S. Track Coaches Association National Female Outdoor Athlete of the Year. An undefeated Felicien won her second consecutive 100 m hurdles national title in 2003 en route to becoming the first University of Illinois female athlete to be named the Big Ten Conference \\"Athlete of the Year\\" while earning NCAA Female Track & Field Athlete of the Year honors. Felicien blossomed into a major force on the international scene in hurdling, topping off her season by winning the women's 100 m Hurdles Final at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris, France. With her win, Felicien became Canada's first ever female world gold medallist and the first female in Illinois track & field history to win a gold medal in an individual event at the World Championships. She was named Canada's female athlete of the year ‚Äì the first track athlete to capture that honor in 25 years. A much-anticipated showdown with hurdling great Gail Devers took place in March 2004. Felicien set a new record in defeating the three- time hurdles world champion in the 60 m hurdle final at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest, Hungary. She chalked up six straight wins leading up to the Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, where she was expected to win gold in the 100 m hurdles on August 24, especially after Devers pulled out with an injury. Unexpectedly, in the event final, Felicien failed to clear the first hurdle and fell into the adjacent lane knocking down the Russian competitor, Irina Shevchenko and taking her out of the race and a chance at an Olympic medal, much to the obvious dismay of Shevchenko. Felicien returned to the track, and had some success, winning medals at the world championships, alongside her teammate Priscilla Lopes-Schliep. In 2007, she won a silver medal at the world championships in the 100 metre hurdles. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Felicien did not compete due to a foot injury. In August 2008, Felicien was a guest commentator for CBC Television's 2008 Olympics coverage of hurdles.CBC Television, Olympic Morning, 19 Aug 2008 During the summer of 2011, Felicien relocated to the University of Calgary in Alberta to train under the tutelage of former national team head coach, Les Gramantik and her old coach, Gary Winckler. She also partnered with Jessica Zelinka, ranked the sixth-best heptathlete in the world. In June 2012, Felicien failed to qualify for the Canadian Olympic team for the 2012 London Olympics. She had finished third in the 2012 Canadian Olympic trials for track and field, in the 100m hurdles event, under protest. However, she false started, and was disqualified. Felicien retired from competition in 2013. She went back to school to study journalism, and was a writer/reporter with CHCH News in Hamilton, Ontario. She was part of the broadcasting team for the Toronto 2015 PanAm Games coverage. In 2018, Felicien joined the CBC broadcast team as a host during the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang in South Korea. Charity Perdita is a proud supporter of Count Me In, the largest youth-run organization in Canada. She spoke to at the 2013 Count Me In Conference in Toronto, inspiring thousands of students to get involved in their communities through volunteerism.

Background Hanff was in search of obscure classics and British literature titles that she had been unable to find in New York City when she noticed an ad in the Saturday Review of Literature. She first contacted the shop in 1949 and it fell to Doel to fulfil her requests. In time, a long-distance friendship developed between the two and between Hanff and other staff members, as well, with an exchange of Christmas packages, birthday gifts and food parcels to help with the post- World War II food shortages in Britain. Their letters included discussions about topics as diverse as the sermons of John Donne, how to make Yorkshire Pudding, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the coronation of Elizabeth II. Hanff postponed visiting her English friends until too late; Doel died in December 1968 from peritonitis from a burst appendix, and the bookshop eventually closed in December 1970. Hanff did finally visit Charing Cross Road and the empty shop in the summer of 1971, a trip recorded in her 1973 book The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street. The shop's site today The five-story building where Marks & Co. was located during the events of the book still exists . A circular brass plaque on a pilaster on the street frontage acknowledges the story and marks the site. The premises were occupied by a music and CD shop in the early 1990s, and later other retail outlets. In 2009 they housed a Med Kitchen restaurant; and now form part of a McDonald's restaurant. In New York, an apartment house on East 72nd Street, near Second Avenue, marks the building in which Hanff wrote her letters.

He was appointed as the first General Director of the Iraqi Special Tribunal, set up in 2003 to try Saddam Hussein and other members of his regime for crimes against humanity. His appointment, by an order signed by Paul Bremer, the head of the occupation authority, was widely criticized for perceived nepotism (his uncle, Ahmed Chalabi, was critically involved in the US-led war against Iraq and Hussein) and he himself lacked any significant trial experience (he was a corporate securities lawyer). He was ultimately dropped from the Tribunal after an arrest warrant was issued for investigation into his role in the murder of a director-general of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance who was investigating Chalabi family properties acquired in Iraq; the charge was ultimately dismissed citing lack of evidence. Biography Salem Chalabi was educated in Britain and in the United States. His uncle Ahmed Chalabi was the controversial leader of the Iraqi National Congress and former member of the Iraq Interim Governing Council and a Deputy Prime Minister; he is also \\"a former banker in Jordan who fled the country in 1989 before he could be arrested in connection with a $200 million financial scandal. He was later tried in his absence and sentenced by a Jordanian court to 22 years in prison on 31 charges of embezzlement, theft, misuse of depositor funds, and currency speculation.\\" Salem studied at Bedford School in England and at Yale University (where he was on the Rugby Team and a member of the controversial Rockingham Club), graduating in 1985. In 1993 he received a law degree from the Northwestern University School of Law. He worked for Morgan, Lewis & Bockius in New York and lastly for Clifford Chance in London, in both instances as a corporate lawyer specialising in capital markets. Salem joined the Dubai office of Stephenson Harwood (Middle East) LLP in 2014 as a partner. Mr. Chalabi was a member, immediately before the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, of the Department of State sponsored Future of Iraq project, to which he was appointed as rapporteur of the Transitional Justice Working Group. Questions about conflicts of interest swirled around Sam Chalabi. Returning to Iraq in April 2003 he founded the controversial Iraqi International Law Group. Chalabi set up this \\"marketing partnership\\" with L. Marc Zell, the former law partner of Douglas J. Feith, the Pentagon's undersecretary for policy. Zell was to help lead American and Russian clients interested in reconstruction to Sam Chalabi's firm, which would in turn help them to meet U.S. and Iraqi officials\\". Zell, born in the United States, moved with his family to the Jewish settlement of Alon Shevut on the West Bank in 1988, at the start of the first Palestinian uprising, acquiring Israeli nationality. His Jerusalem based firm, whose staff produced the content of the Iraqi International Law Group's website, cites as one of its main activities assisting Israeli companies to do business abroad. \\"In interviews, Sam Chalabi spoke of his daily contacts with his uncle [Ahmed Chalabi], and the fact that one of his 26 first cousins was the Iraqi minister of trade.\\" Sam Chalabi also played an important role in the new government: as an advisor on the writing of commercial laws and a national constitution, among other issues. After \\"an outpouring of publicity\\", Sam Chalabi disbanded the partnership, saying, \\"I have to be more careful about the appearance of a conflict of interest.\\"\\". Salem Chalabi was also appointed as counsel to newly founded security firm Erinys, which \\"won a plum $80 million contract to guard Iraqi oil installations, employing members of Chalabi's private militia for the purpose\\".  Iraqi special tribunal  With the capture of Saddam Hussein on December 13, 2003, an Iraqi Special Tribunal was announced, with Salem placed in charge by an order signed by L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the occupation authority. As such, Salem was responsible for the setting up and the administration of the tribunal, including the nomination of judges and prosecutors; he also arranged for the judges to visit the Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá' tribunal at the Hague. However, on August 8, 2004, while Salem was in London, a warrant was issued in Iraq for his arrest, for his alleged involvement in the May 28, 2004, death of Haithem Fadhil, director-general of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. On the same day, a warrant was issued for the arrest of his uncle, Ahmed Chalabi, on money counterfeiting charges. However, those charges were dropped in late September 2004, with Judge Zuhair al-Maliki citing lack of evidence. The charges against Salem Chalabi were dropped in December 2004, citing lack of evidence. On September 7, 2004, it was reported that Chalabi had been removed or was about to be removed from his post as head of the tribunal. On September 19, 2004, the New York Times quoted Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi as saying that he had received Salem's resignation. Mr. Chalabi was engaged as the head of the Iraq practice of DLA Piper until 2014.

Early life  Mestre was born in Saint-Denis, Seine- Saint-Denis, to a family of snorkeling and scuba diving enthusiasts. She began swimming when she was still a baby and won a gold medal in a 25-meter swimming competition at only age two. She became a seasoned scuba diver by age thirteen but did not get full certification until her sixteenth birthday due to French law.http://audreymestre.com/bio.htm She was still in her teens when her family moved to Mexico City and, fluent in the Spanish language, she eventually studied marine biology at a university in La Paz, Mexico.  Relationship with Francisco \\"Pip√≠n\\" Ferreras  In 1996 her interest in underwater sports led to her meeting free-diver Francisco \\"Pip√≠n\\" Ferreras. They immediately developed a relationship and Mestre soon moved to Miami, Florida to live with Ferreras. There, she took up serious free-diving and with Ferreras as her instructor was soon reaching record depths. In 1999 the two diving aficionados married and the following year, off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Audrey Mestre broke the female world record by free diving to a depth of 125 meters (410 ft) on a single breath of air. A year later she broke her own record, by descending to 130 meters (427 ft).  Death  In October 2002, Mestre died in an early attempt to break the 160 meters no-limits free-diving world record that Tanya Streeter had established a few weeks before on August 17, 2002 (at that time this was both men and women's official AIDA record). On October 4, 2002, with a dive team under her husband's supervision, she made a practice dive off Bayahibe Beach in the Dominican Republic to a record depth of 166 metres (545 ft). After more deep dive practices, on October 12 she prepared to attempt a dive to 171 metres. On reaching 171 metres she opened the valve on the air tank to inflate the lift bag which would raise her rapidly to the surface but the cylinder had no air in it. A rescue diver arrived and inflated the lift bag with his air supply but the bag did not rise fast enough due to insufficient inflation, the riser rope being non-vertical and strong currents. A dive that should have been no more than three minutes resulted in her remaining underwater for more than eight and a half minutes. By the time her husband put on scuba gear and dove down to pick up her unconscious body to the surface it was too late and she was pronounced dead at a hospital on shore. The dive was controversial and heavily criticised as the setup did not match common freediving safety standards. Much of the diving community critique targeted her husband Ferreras who had hurried an underfunded organisation for this record attempt, previously planned for a later date, notably with too few safety divers, lacking proper rescue equipment, with no doctors at sea and shore. Ferreras was in charge of Mestre's lift bag air tank and did not allow any of the team to check that the tank had been charged. Mestre was not recovered to the surface until nine minutes into her dive, she had a pulse at the surface, but there were no medical doctors available to treat her and minutes were wasted with Ferreras attempting to resuscitate her in the water. An ESPN documentary film written and directed by Alison Ellwood in 2013 had live video footage of the incident and interviews with crew members and staff.  Awards and accolades  Audrey Mestre was cremated, her ashes scattered at sea. In 2002, she was inducted posthumously into the Women Divers Hall of Fame and in August 2004 a book that tells her story was written by her husband and published under the title The Dive: A Story of Love and Obsession (). In 2013, Mestre's life and career were chronicled in ESPN's No Limits as part of their Nine for IX series.

It was renamed the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation in honor of his wife, Susan Buffett, who died in 2004. As of 2014, the Buffet Foundation ranked fourth among family foundations by grants paid. It invests heavily in reproductive health and family planning grants across the world, including substantial investments in abortion and contraceptives. According to Mother Jones, the Buffett Foundation is known for its focus on abortion access and for its \\"secrecy...often appearing under grant acknowledgements only as 'an anonymous donor.'\\" Management Allen Greenberg, the executive director of the foundation, was married from 1983 to 1995 to the Buffetts' daughter, Susie, who is chair. The Buffett Foundation was set up in 1964 but had no director until Greenberg took the job in 1987. History Susan Buffett's will bestowed about $2.5 billion on the foundation, to which her husband's further gifts of $315 million have been added. Giving The Buffett Foundation does not accept unsolicited requests, preferring instead to seek out worthy recipients on its own. Of the $17.6 million that the Buffett Foundation donated in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999, nearly $3.8 million went to Planned Parenthood, among its top contributors. It also involves itself directly at the clinic level. International Projects Assistance Services (IPAS), based in Carrboro, North Carolina, manufactures a handheld suction pump used in developing countries to initiate abortions. The Buffett Foundation has backed IPAS for years. Its 1999 contribution of $2.5 million was part of a five-year, $20 million commitment that will enable IPAS to double its capacity. The foundation provides grants to a large range of U.S. and a few international organizations, including the Willows Foundation in Turkey (‚Ç¨2.3 million), the World Food Programme in Italy (‚Ç¨800,000), Marie Stopes International in the UK (‚Ç¨571,000); and Grupo de Informacion en Reproduccion Elegida in Mexico (‚Ç¨196,000). By 2008, the Foundation had nearly $4 billion in assets. In 2007, Omaha's Building Bright Futures initiative promised financial support to low-income students in the area who wanted to attend college. Abortion funding In the 1990s, the Buffett Foundation helped finance the development of the abortion drug RU-486. Between 2001 and 2014, the foundation contributed over $1.5 billion to abortion related causes, including at least $427 million to Planned Parenthood and $168 million to the National Abortion Federation. It has also funded the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks demographic and legislative trends, and Gynuity Health Projects, which focuses on medication abortion. Gates Foundation Front building of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle. Warren Buffett's intention was originally to leave 99% of his estate to the Buffett Foundation, but in June 2006 he announced that he would give 85% of his wealth to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation instead. Buffett stated that he changed his mind because he has grown to admire Gates's foundation over the years; he believed that the Gates Foundation would be able to use his money effectively because it was already scaled-up.Fortune. A conversation with Warren Buffett. June 25, 2006. \\"Susan's Foundation\\" is to receive a bequest of about $3 billion over a span of many years. Source of wealth The vast bulk of Buffett's wealth consists of his personal holdings in Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate of which he controls almost 40% directly, and which he has managed personally since the mid-1960s. Giving away such a large part of his company holding could prove problematic in that much of the business of Berkshire Hathaway consists of stock-issuing insurance companies, such as GEICO and General Re. In the past, many state insurance regulators have had serious concerns about allowing for- profit insurance companies - as opposed to mutual insurance companies - to be ultimately controlled by non-profit entities. In a famous case regarding this, the MacArthur Foundation was forced to divest itself of Bankers Life and Accident.

For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams; however, large cantilever bridges designed to handle road or rail traffic use trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when first put into practice, as it can span distances of over , and can be more easily constructed at difficult crossings by virtue of using little or no falsework.  Origins  The original style of cantilever bridge Engineers in the 19th century understood that a bridge that was continuous across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This would result in lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several 19th- century engineers patented continuous bridges with hinge points mid-span. The use of a hinge in the multi-span system presented the advantages of a statically determinate system and of a bridge that could handle differential settlement of the foundations. Engineers could more easily calculate the forces and stresses with a hinge in the girder. Heinrich Gerber was one of the engineers to obtain a patent for a hinged girder (1866) and is recognized as the first to build one. The Hassfurt Bridge over the Main river in Germany with a central span of 124 feet (38 metres) was completed in 1867 and is recognized as the first modern cantilever bridge. Human demonstration of the principle The High Bridge of Kentucky by C. Shaler Smith (1877), the Niagara Cantilever Bridge by Charles Conrad Schneider (1883) and the Poughkeepsie Bridge by John Francis O'Rourke and Pomeroy P. Dickinson (1889) were all important early uses of the cantilever design. The Kentucky River Bridge spanned a gorge that was 275 feet (84 metres) deep and took full advantage of the fact that falsework, or temporary support, is not needed for the main span of a cantilever bridge. The most famous early cantilever bridge is the Forth Bridge. This bridge held the record for longest span in the world for twenty nine years, until it was surpassed by the Quebec Bridge. Benjamin Baker illustrated the structural principles of the suspended span cantilever in the photo on the right. The suspended span, where Kaichi Watanabe sits, is seen in the center. The need to resist compression of the lower chord is seen in the use of wooden poles while the tension of the upper chord is shown by the outstretched arms. The action of the outer foundations as anchors for the cantilever is visible in the placement of the counterweights.  Function  A simple cantilever span is formed by two cantilever arms extending from opposite sides of an obstacle to be crossed, meeting at the center. In a common variant, the suspended span, the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central truss bridge which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special travelling supports. A diagram of the parts of the John P. Grace Memorial Bridge A common way to construct steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge. Steel truss cantilevers support loads by tension of the upper members and compression of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore statically determinate with no members carrying mixed loads. Prestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using segmental construction.  Construction methods Some steel arch bridges (such as the Navajo Bridge) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a truss arch bridge. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock is available to support the tension in the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons. The old eastern span of the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge, pictured in August 2014, is deconstructed in nearly the reverse order of its construction. Similar temporary supports were used under each anchor arm during the bridge's construction.

The northernmost island in the group, it is located at north-north-east of the capital island of Rarotonga, 9 degrees south of the equator. Its nearest neighbours are Rakahanga, and Manihiki, approximately to the southwest. Once one of the most heavily populated atolls, it was almost completely depopulated by Peruvian slavers in 1864. Geography Map of Penrhyn Atoll Penrhyn is a roughly circular coral atoll with a circumference of approximately , enclosing a lagoon with an area of . The atoll is atop the highest submarine volcano in the Cook Islands, rising from the ocean floor. The atoll is low-lying, with a maximum elevation of less than . The total land area is . The atoll rim consists of 18 major islets. Clockwise, from the Northwest, these are: * Tokerau * Painko * Ruahara * Takuua * Veseru * Tuirai * Pokerekere Islet * Kavea * Temata * Patanga * Tepuka * Ahu a Miria * Atutahi * Moturakina * Atiati * Mangarongaro * Moananui Islet * Matunga * Tekasi History Captain Otto von Kotzebue meets the inhabitants of Penrhyn Atoll, 30 April 1816 Polynesians are believed to have lived on Penrhyn since 900 or 1000 AD. According to oral tradition, the island was fished up by Vatea, using part of his thigh as bait, and has been inhabited since the time of creation. Other lends tell of the island being visited by various ancestors of Tangiia-nui of Rarotonga on their way from Samoa to Tahiti. Other ancestors came from Aitutaki and Rakahanga. The Polynesians named the atoll Tongareva (\\"Tonga floating in space\\", \\"Tonga-in-the-skies\\" and \\"Away from the South\\"). The island was first discovered by Europeans in 1788, when the Lady Penrhyn commanded by Captain William Crofton Sever, passed by the island on 8 August while returning from delivering the first convicts to Australia. It was later visited by the Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue in April 1816, and then by the American brig USS Purpose, under command of Lieutenant Commander Cadwalader Ringgold as part of the United States Exploring Expedition in February 1841. The brig Chatham ran aground at Penrhyn during a storm in January 1853, resulting in some of the crew being stranded on the island for almost a year. One of them, the trader Edward Henry Lamont, documented his stay in Wild Life among the Pacific Islanders. The London Missionary Society, which had begun missionary activities in the Cook Islands from 1821, sent a grop of three Polynesian missionaries to Penrhyn in 1854. Robert Louis Stevenson visited Penrhyn in May 1890. =Slavery= In the early 1860s, Penrhyn was almost completely depopulated by Peruvian blackbirding expeditions. In 1862 the ship Adelante took hundreds of Tongarevans aboard, ostensibly to transport them to a nearby island as agricultural workers. The Tongarevans went willingly: coconut blight had led to famine, while the local missionaries saw work overseas as a way of bring money to the atoll to pay for larger churches. Once on board, they were shackled in the hold and guarded day and night. 253 survived the voyage to reach Callao in Peru, where they were sold for between $100 and $200 each. Further slaving expeditions followed, and in total 472 Tongarevans were sold in Peru. =Foreign claims= Penrhyn was officially annexed for Great Britain by Captain Sir William Wiseman of HMS Caroline on 22 March 1888. The island was considered to have a strategic location on the route of a proposed Trans-Pacific telegraphic connection between Canada and Australia. The Cook Islands were a British protectorate 1888 to 1900, when annexed to New Zealand, until independence in 1965 when residents chose self-government in free association with New Zealand. From 1856 to 1980, the United States claimed sovereignty over the island under the Guano Islands Act. That claim had never been recognised by Britain, New Zealand or the Cook Islands and New Zealand sovereignty was recognised during World War II U.S. military operations involving the islands. On 11 June 1980, in connection with establishing the maritime boundary between the Cook Islands and American Samoa, the United States signed Cook Islands ‚Äì United States Maritime Boundary Treaty acknowledging that Penryhn was under Cook Islands sovereignty. =World War II= In early 1942 Japanese advances had placed the South Pacific air ferry route's initial path at some risk so that an alternate route was directed. In March Leif J. Sverdrup determined on a tour of potential island sites that Penrhyn was suitable and, though all land was owned by the local population and it was illegal to sell, use could be arranged and local labour could help build an airfield. U.S.Navy Seabees began work on a runway in July 1942 with aviation gasoline storage tanks added to the completed field. Two additional runways were added later. During the war, US Navy PBY Catalina and USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers were stationed on the island and with about a thousand support personnel. A communications link through the island was established by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. American forces were withdrawn in September 1946. The US Army vessel Southern Seas struck an uncharted reef on 22 July 1942 and was severely damaged with flooded engine rooms and abandoned in Taruia Pass while on an island charting assignment in support of the construction. The ship was later salvaged by the Navy and commissioned for naval use. =Cyclone Pat= In February 2010 much of Omoka was damaged by Cyclone Pat, but there were no serious casualties. The village school was demolished and the community was left without teaching facilities. Tongareva's Women's Craft Guild loaned their meeting house, however this meant that five classes ranging from 3‚Äì16 years old had to be taught in a single room. New Zealand Aid paid completely for a new school to be constructed, Meitaki Poria. Demographics When Kotzebue visited Penrhyn, he found its people \\"so numerous, in proportion to the island, that I cannot, even now, think how so many can find subsistence\\". This was formerly one of the most densely inhabited atolls in Polynesia, with an estimated pre-European population of 2,000. Depopulation by slavers reduced this to just 88 people, and its population on annexation by New Zealand was just 420. =Villages= All of the habitable islets were previously occupied, with Moananui home to two rival settlements. Following the arrival of the missionaries, the population concentrated around the churches in four villages. Two of these villages were subsequently abandoned due to depopulation by slavers. Today Penrhyn Atoll has two villages. The main village of Omoka, seat of Penrhyn Island Council, is on Moananui Islet, on the western rim of the atoll, north of the airport. The village of Te Tautua is on Pokerekere Islet (also known as Pokerere or Tautua), on the eastern rim. The inhabitants of the island are Christian, with 92% of the population belonging to the Cook Islands Christian Church while the remaining 8% adhere to the Roman Catholic Church. Economy and resources Aerial view of Tongareva The World War II airstrip is still used today as Tongareva Airport, with its initial 3000 meter runway reduced to 1700 meters. Weekly flights to the atoll by Air Rarotonga are subject to frequent cancellation due to lack of passengers or lack of fuel on Penrhyn for the return flight. A large passage in the lagoon allows inter-island ships to enter the lagoon, and the island has become popular as a stopover for yachts crossing the Pacific from Panama to New Zealand. The inter-island Taio Shipping company visits the island approximately every three months. The locally produced Rito hats are woven from fibre from young coconut leaves which are stripped, boiled and dried resulting in a fine white leaf. Called rito weaving, the traditional items woven are Sunday church fans, small baskets and hats, the hats originally being a copy of the ones the sailors wore. Weaving is now the major economic activity in both villages, with special designs being passed down through the families; both traditional and artificial dyes may be used. =Black pearl farming= Black pearl farming, together with mother of pearl, was previously the only significant economic activity on the island. Pearl farming began in 1997‚Äì1998, but in 2000 algal blooms spread around the lagoon and a virus killed the pearl oysters. The stocks never recovered and the final harvest was in 2003, resulting in significant loss of equipment, outlay and resources.Ru Taime, formerly Ministry of Marine Resources at Tongareva =Food= The present population of the island rely on the ocean for most of their food as well as locally grown plants such as coconut, pawpaw, breadfruit and puraka (yam). Every morning (except on Sundays) men from the island head out in small tin boats to spear or trawl for fish for their families. The islanders' diet is supplemented by imported rice and flour shipped in from Rarotonga or Hawai'i. The boats are infrequent (usually every 3 months); however, the boat is often late and the people of Tongareva make do with what food they can provide for themselves, as their ancestors have done for centuries. =Energy= Electricity has been supplied by a generator in each village (Omoka 65 KVA, Te Tautua 35 KVA); these had been installed by Australian AID. Provision of diesel fuel required two long sea voyages: Auckland to Rarotonga, then onwards to the northern Cooks (ships travelled 7000 km each way). To save fuel electricity was always turned off overnight (11 pm to 6 am). The New Zealand Government (Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade) decided to assist the Cook Islands Government by funding solar power arrays in all the northern atolls. The AID programme Uira Natura ko Tokerau was for NZ$20 million. The build was by PowerSmart Solar of New Zealand Construction began 23 February 2015 and each village was solar powered by the end of May 2015. Some minor work is ongoing, but by the end of June 2015 all northern atolls will be fully on renewable energy. This greatly reduces the island's carbon footprint. The Omoka solar farm and Te Tautua solar farm now provide 126 kW and 42 kW respectively.

Biography =Early life= Takeo Kurita was born in Mito city, Ibaraki Prefecture, in 1889. He was sent off to Etajima in 1905 and graduated from the 38th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1910, ranked 28th out of a class of 149 cadets. As a midshipman, he served on the cruisers and . On being commissioned as ensign in 1911, he was assigned to . After his promotion to sub-lieutenant in 1913, Kurita served on the battleship , destroyer and cruiser . Kurita became a lieutenant on 1 December 1916, and served on a number of ships: protected cruiser , destroyers and . He also served as either the chief torpedo officer or executive officer on Minekaze, , and . In 1920, he was given his first command: the destroyer Shigure. In 1921, he assumed command of . Promoted to lieutenant commander in 1922, Kurita captained the destroyers , , and . As commander from 1927, he commanded the destroyer , 25th Destroyer Group and 10th Destroyer Group. As captain from 1932, he commanded the 12th Destroyer Group, the cruiser , and from 1937 the battleship . Kurita became a rear admiral on November 15, 1938, commanding the 1st Destroyer Flotilla then the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. He was in command of the 7th Cruiser Division at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. =World War II= Early campaigns Kurita's 7th Cruiser Division participated in the invasion of Java in the Dutch East Indies in December 1941, and in the Indian Ocean Raid where he led a fleet of six heavy cruisers and the light carrier that sank 135,000 tons of shipping in the Bay of Bengal. During the Battle of Midway (serving under Nobutake Kond≈ç), he lost the cruiser . Kurita was promoted to vice admiral on 1 May 1942, and was reassigned to the 3rd Battleship Division in July. In the Guadalcanal Campaign, Kurita led his battleships in an intense bombardment of Henderson Field on the night of 13 October, firing 918 heavy high explosive shells at the American airfield. This was the single most successful Japanese attempt to incapacitate Henderson Field by naval bombardment. Kurita later commanded major naval forces during the Central Solomon Islands campaign and during the Battle of Philippine Sea. In 1943, Kurita replaced Admiral Kond≈ç as the commander of IJN 2nd Fleet. Battle of Leyte Gulf It was as Commander-in-Chief of the IJN 2nd Fleet dubbed \\"Central Force\\" during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea and the Battle off Samar (Both part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf) for which Kurita is best known. The IJN 2nd Fleet included the largest battleships in the world, and . Additionally, the IJN 2nd Fleet included the battleships , , and , 10 cruisers and 13 destroyers. Critically, however, the IJN Second Fleet did not include any aircraft carriers. Kurita was a dedicated officer, willing to die if necessary, but not wishing to die in vain. Like Yamamoto, Kurita believed that for a captain to \\"go down with his ship\\" was a wasteful loss of valuable naval experience and leadership. When ordered by Admiral Soemu Toyoda to take his fleet through the San Bernardino Strait in the central Philippines and attack the American landings at Leyte, Kurita thought the effort a waste of ships and lives, especially since he could not get his fleet to Leyte Gulf until five days after the landings, leaving little more than empty transports for his huge battleships to attack. He bitterly resented his superiors, who, while safe in bunkers in Tokyo, ordered Kurita to fight to the death against hopeless odds and without air cover. At the same time, Toyoda was aware that the plan was a major gamble, but as the Imperial Japanese Navy fleet was running out of fuel and other critical supplies, he felt that the potential gain offset the risk of losing a fleet that was about to become useless in any event. =Ambush in the Palawan Passage= While his fleet was en route from Brunei to attack the American Invasion fleet, Kurita's ships were attacked in Palawan Passage by U.S. submarines. damaged heavy cruiser and sank Kurita's flagship heavy cruiser , forcing him to swim for his life while sank heavy cruiser . Kurita was plucked from the water by a destroyer and transferred his flag to the Yamato, but Kurita's dunking did him little good, especially since he had only recently recovered from a severe case of dengue fever, and no doubt contributed to the fatigue which may have influenced his subsequent actions. =Battle of the Sibuyan Sea= While in the confines of the Sibuyan Sea and approaching the San Bernardino Strait, Kurita's force underwent five aerial attacks by U.S. carrier planes which damaged several of his ships, including Yamato.Ito, \\"The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy\\", p.127 Constant air attacks from Admiral William \\"Bull\\" Halsey's 3rd Fleet scored two bomb hits on Yamato, reducing her speed, and numerous torpedo and bomb hits on Musashi, mortally wounding her. They also scored a number of damaging near misses on other vessels, reducing fleet speed to 18 knots.Ito, \\"The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy\\", p.128 Knowing that he was already six hours behind schedule and facing the possibility of a sixth attack in the narrow confines of the San Bernardino strait Kurita requested air support and turned his fleet west away from Leyte Gulf.Ito, \\"The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy\\", p. 129 Thus began a chain of events that continues to engage historians and biographers to this day. Halsey, believing that he had mauled Kurita's fleet and that the Japanese \\"Central Forces\\" were retreating, and believing that he had the orders and authorization to do so, abandoned his station guarding General MacArthur's landing at Leyte Gulf and the San Bernardino Strait, in order to pursue Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa's Northern Fleet of Japanese carriers that were sent as a decoy to lure the Americans away from Leyte. But before doing so, in fact before Ozawa's force had been sighted, Halsey had sent a message announcing a \\"battle plan\\" to detach his battleships to cover the exit of the strait. With the decision to attack Ozawa, this battle plan was never executed and the heavy ships went north with the carriers. Unfortunately for Halsey, after an hour and a half without further air attacks Kurita turned east again at 1715 towards San Bernardino strait and the eventual encounter with Kinkaid's forces in Leyte Gulf.Ito, \\"The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy\\", p.132 =Battle off Samar= Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, Commander 7th Fleet and responsible for protecting the landing forces, assumed that Halsey's \\"Battle Plan\\" was a deployment order and that Task Force 34 (TF 34) was actually guarding San Bernardino Strait. Kinkaid thus concentrated his battleships to the south in order to face the Japanese \\"Southern Force\\". During the night of 24‚Äì25 October 1944, Kurita changed his mind again, and turned his ships around and headed east again, toward Leyte Gulf. On the morning of 25 October, Kurita's fleet, led by Yamato, exited San Bernardino Strait and sailed south along the coast of Samar. 30 minutes after dawn, the battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy sighted \\"Taffy 3\\" ‚Äî a task unit of Kinkaid's covering forces that consisted of six escort carriers, three destroyers and four destroyer escorts, commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague. Taffy 3 was intended to provide shore support and anti-submarine patrols, not to engage in fleet action against battleships. Believing he had chanced upon the carriers of the American 3rd Fleet, Kurita immediately ordered his battleships to open fire. Recognizing that his best chance depended upon destroying the aircraft carriers before they could launch their aircraft, Kurita gave the order for \\"General Attack\\" rather than take the time to reform his ships for action with the enemy. Kurita then compounded his error by ordering his destroyers to the rear to prevent them from obstructing his battleships' line of fire, preventing them from racing ahead to cut off the slower American carriers. Concern that his destroyers would burn too much fuel in a flank speed stern chase of what Kurita presumed were 30 knot fleet carriers also played a part in Kurita's decision.Ito, \\"The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy\\", p.172 However, at the moment Taffy 3 was sighted, Center Force was in the midst of changing from nighttime scouting to daytime air defense steaming formation. Kurita's ships thus charged uncoordinated into action and Kurita quickly lost tactical control of the battle, a situation not helped by poor visibility, intermittent rain squalls and a wind direction favorable to the Americans, who immediately began to make smoke for additional concealment. Kurita's forces mauled Taffy 3, sinking the escort carrier , the destroyers and , and the destroyer escort , and inflicting significant damage on most of the other ships. But continual air attacks by aircraft from Taffy 3 and Taffy 2 stationed farther south and a determined counterattack by the U.S. escorts served to further confuse and separate Kurita's forces. Kurita, whose flagship fell far behind early in the battle while avoiding a torpedo salvo from USS Hoel, lost sight of the enemy and many of his own ships. Meanwhile, the courageous efforts of the Taffies had cost him three heavy cruisers: , , and . Many of his other ships had also been hit and most had suffered casualties from the relentless strafing. After about two and a half hours in action with Taffy 3, Kurita ordered his force to regroup on a northerly course, away from Leyte. By this time, Kurita had received news that the Japanese Southern Force, which was to attack Leyte Gulf from the south, had already been destroyed by Kinkaid's battleships. With Musashi gone, Kurita still had four battleships but only three cruisers remaining, all of his ships were low on fuel and most of them were damaged. Kurita was intercepting messages that indicated Admiral Halsey had sunk all four carriers of the \\"Northern Force\\" and was racing back to Leyte with his battleships to confront the Japanese fleet, and that powerful elements of 7th Fleet were approaching from Leyte Gulf. After steaming back and forth off Samar for two more hours, Kurita, who'd been on Yamatos bridge for nearly 48 hours by this point, and his chief of staff Tomiji Koyanagi decided to retire and retreated back through the San Bernardino Strait. Kurita's ships were subjected to further air attack the rest of the day and Halsey's battleships just missed catching him that night, sinking the destroyer , which had remained behind to save the survivors from Chikuma. Kurita's retreat saved Yamato and the remainder of the IJN 2nd Fleet from certain destruction, but he had failed to complete his mission, attacking the amphibious forces in Leyte Gulf. The path had been laid open to him by the sacrifices of the Northern and Southern Forces, but closed again by the determination and courage of the Taffies. =After Leyte and postwar= Kurita was criticized by some elements in the Japanese military for not fighting to the death. In December, Kurita was removed from command. In order to protect him against assassination, he was reassigned as commandant of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy. Following the Japanese surrender, Kurita found work as a scrivener and masseur, living quietly with his daughter and her family. He was found by an American naval officer after the war where he was interviewed for the Analysis Division of the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. > With Kurita's address in hand, a young American naval officer got out of a > jeep and spotted the unimposing figure tending to his garden chores. Years > later, he still vividly recalled the moment: \\"It really made an impression > of me. The war was just over. Less than a year before Kurita had been in > command of the largest fleet that was ever put together, and there he was > out there chopping potatoes.\\" Goralski 323 Kurita never discussed politics or the war with his family or others, except to conduct a brief interview with a journalist, Masanori It≈ç, in 1954 when he stated that he had made a mistake at Leyte by turning away and not continuing with the battle, a statement he later retracted. In retirement, Kurita made twice-yearly pilgrimages to Yasukuni Shrine to pray for his dead comrades-in- arms. In 1966, he was present at the deathbed of his old colleague, Jisabur≈ç Ozawa, at which he silently wept. It was not until he was in his 80s that Kurita began to again speak of his actions at Leyte. He claimed privately to a former Naval Academy student (and biographer), Jiro Ooka, that he withdrew the fleet from the battle because he did not believe in wasting the lives of his men in a futile effort, having long since believed that the war was lost. Kurita died in 1977 at age 88, and his grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchu, Tokyo. References Further reading =Books= *Cutler, Thomas (2001). The Battle of Leyte Gulf: 23‚Äì26 October 1944.

She played an important political role during the French Wars of Religion and built the H√¥tel d'Angoul√™me in Paris. Birth and early life In October 1537, the eighteen-year-old Henry, who had recently become the dauphin but was not yet king, was in Moncalieri in northern Italy on a military campaign.Mari√©jol 1920, p. 37.P√©bay & Troquet 1990, p. 153P√©bay and Troquet 1992, p. 88 There he had an affair with a young woman, usually identified as Filippa Duci (), the daughter of a lesser noble of Fossano in the PiedmontMerrill 1935, p. 133. and the sister of Jean-Antoine, a page or groom in the Grand √âcurie.Knecht 1998, p. 29. This union produced an illegitimate daughter, born 25 July 1538 and later known as Diane de France. It is not known whether she was born at court or was brought there when still very young.P√©bay & Troquet 1990, p. 154. At court, her care and upbringing were entrusted to Henry's younger sister, Margaret. Diane's father treated her well: her household included a governess, tutors, maids of honor, chamber valets, and even a tailor. Her tutors turned her into an accomplished princess. She learned to write in excellent French, the proof of which can be seen in the large number letters that still survive. She also learned Italian (the second language of the court), Spanish, and enough Latin for religious ceremonies. Her artistic education was not neglected: she also learned to play lute and other instruments, and to sing.Jeanice Brooks, Courtly Song in Late Sixteenth-Century France, (University of Chicago Press, 2000), 12. She was not formally legitimised until much later, in 1572 (not 1547 as previously believed).Lhote and Troquet 2013, p. 4. First marriage On 13 February 1552, when Diane de France was thirteen, a contract was signed by which she married Orazio Farnese, Duke of Castro ().Picot 1907, p. 8, note 2.Helge Gamrath, Farnese: Pomp, Power and Politics in Renaissance Italy, (L'Erma di Bretschneider, 2007), 70. . . The wedding ceremony on 15 February 1553 was attended by Orazio's brother Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and included masquerades and carnival banquets.Cooper 2007, p. 136. She became a widow five months later, on 18 July 1553, when Orazio was killed while serving with French forces at the siege of Hesdin.Setton 1984, p. 596, note 119, gives the date as 16 July. She spent her period of mourning at the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly, home of Anne de Montmorency, Conn√©table de France, then returned to court in the service of Catherine de Medici. Second marriage Diane's second marriage was to Francis de Montmorency, eldest son of Anne de Montmorency, by a contract of 3 May 1557 and a ceremony that took place on 4 June 1557 at the Ch√¢teau de Villers-Cotter√™ts.P√©bay and Troquet 1992, p. 88; Lanza 2007, p. 29. They had a son, named Anne after his grandfather, born in 1560 but died in the cradle.Lhote 2013, p. 5. On 22 June 1563, after the death of her father and then her half-brother Francis II, the new king, her half-brother Charles IX gave her, by lettres patentes signed at the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes, the Duchy of Ch√¢tellerault. The annual revenues of about 6,000 livres were meant to compensate for the gift of 50,000 √©cus promised for her first marriage but never paid from the royal treasury. The revenues from this duchy were far less than what she was owed. After the death of Charles, Diane became a favourite of the new king, her other half-brother Henri III. In February 1576, he signed additional lettres patentes, giving her the lands and seigneuries of Coucy and Folembray (both in today's d√©partement of Aisne), as well as some other estates in the Bourbonnais. Diane was widowed for a second time in 1579, after helping make her husband a leader of the politiques, a moderate Roman Catholic group in France. Later life In August 1582, Henry III gave her the Duchy of Angoul√™me in exchange for that of Ch√¢tellerault, making her Duchess of Angoul√™me in appanage (during her lifetime only). The new title came with increased wealth, so in 1584 she started building a new Paris residence, the H√¥tel d'Angoul√™me (now the H√¥tel Lamoignon). Construction was likely interrupted by the Wars of Religion, and only completed with a second phase of construction in 1611.Ayers, Andrew (2004). \\"H√¥tel Lamoignon\\", pp. 99‚Äì100, in The Architecture of Paris.

Paris: Imprimerie Municipale, 1922. Diane also enjoyed much respect at the court of Henry IV, King of France, and superintended the education of his son Louis XIII. Diane died on 11 January 1619 in Paris. Her surviving letters reveal her as a woman of great courage and tolerance.

The strip was originally called Fritzi Ritz, but over several years, the focus changed from ditzy Fritzi to her niece Nancy, who got her own Sunday topper strip starting October 3, 1938.  History  = 1922 to 1982 = The character of Nancy, a precocious eight-year-old, first appeared in the strip Fritzi Ritz about the airheaded flapper title character. Larry Whittington began Fritzi Ritz in 1922,\\"Fritzi Ritz Before Bushmiller: She's Come a Long Way, Baby!\\" , Hogan's Alley #7 (1999) and it was assumed by Bushmiller three years later. On January 2, 1933, Bushmiller introduced Fritzi's niece, Nancy. In 1949, he was quoted as saying that he originally intended Nancy \\"just as an incidental character and I planned to keep her for about a week and then dump her... But the little dickens was soon stealing the show and Bushmiller, the ingrate, was taking all the bows.\\" Virginia Irwin, 'Nancy: Ernie Bushmiller Rates High as Comic Artist, but He Wasn't Doing So Good Until Little Girl With Bangs Popped Out of an Ink Bottle', St Louis Post-Dispatch, 13 February 1949 p. 63 Nancy became the focus of the daily strip, which was renamed for her in 1938 after Lawrence W. Hager, editor of the Owensboro, Kentucky Inquirer-Messenger (now the Messenger-Inquirer), lobbied for the change; Virginia Irwin, 'Nancy: Ernie Bushmiller Rates High as Comic Artist, but He Wasn't Doing So Good Until Little Girl With Bangs Popped Out of an Ink Bottle', St Louis Post-Dispatch, 13 February 1949 p. 63\\"'Nancy' took Ernie Bushmiller into big time of comic strips' Owensboro, Kentucky Inquirer, 30 June 1948 p. 3 Sluggo Smith, Nancy's friend from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" had been introduced earlier that year, and the strip's popularity rose. Fritzi Ritz became a secondary character, although her solo strip continued as a Sunday-only strip, and her relationship with Phil Fumble was an ongoing presence until his departure in 1968. Comics historian Don Markstein ascribed the strip's success to Bushmiller's \\"bold, clear art style, combined with his ability to construct a type of gag that appealed to a very broad audience. Phil Fumble made a reappearance in the November 27, 2012, strip, and became a regular character as of early January 2013, with the intention of furthering his relationship with Aunt Fritzi. Fritzi Ritz continued as a Sunday feature until 1968. At its peak in the 1970s, Nancy ran in more than 880 newspapers, before falling to 79 shortly before Guy Gilchrist's departure from the strip in 2018.Schmitt, Brad. \\"'Nancy' comic strip's Guy Gilchrist to step away after 22 years of Sluggo-ing it out,\\" USA TODAY (Jan. 2, 2018). = 1982 to 2018 = Al Plastino worked on Sunday episodes of Nancy from 1982 to 1984 after Bushmiller died. During that period, David Letterman showed on TV a Nancy panel with Plastino's signature and made a joke about Plastino as a superhero name. (Letterman's writers were apparently unaware that Plastino was known for his superheroes.) The strip has continued to the present day by different writers and artists. Mark Lasky briefly handled the daily strip in 1982/1983 until his death from cancer at age 29. The strip was handed to Jerry Scott in 1983, who gradually started to draw the strip in a much different, more modern style than other incarnations. In 1994, the syndicate began seeking a replacement for Scott; applicants included Ivan BrunettiI ALMOST DREW NANCY, by Ivan Brunetti; in Roctober magazine, #26 (1999/2000); archived online at MikeLynchCartoons.blogspot.com; retrieved October 25, 2016 and Gary Hallgren.garyhallgren.com gallery; retrieved May 12, 2018 In 1995, Guy and Brad Gilchrist were given control of the strip; Guy Gilchrist subsequently became the sole author and illustrator.

Following a two-month hiatus, the strip resumed on April 9 with \\"21st-century female perspective\\" from a person using the pen name Olivia Jaimes, the strip's first-ever female author. At the time of the announcement, 75 newspapers still ran the strip. Jaimes said, \\"Nancy has been my favorite sassy grouch for a long time. I'm excited to be sassy and grouchy through her voice instead of just mine\\" and \\"the Nancy I know and love is a total jerk and also gluttonous and also has big feelings and voraciously consumes her world\\". Comics historian Tom Spurgeon described Jaimes as funny and talented, with an approach to the character that both breaks with and pays homage to Bushmiller's version. In the process, Jaimes updated the strip's technology, including Nancy frequently using her smartphone and attending robotics classes. The September 3, 2018 strip spawned an Internet meme, depicting Nancy riding a hoverboard using two phones, one of which was attached to a selfie stick, and proclaiming that \\"Sluggo is lit.\\" Jaimes described her aim with that strip to \\"most upset the person who likes me the least ... somebody who's like, 'Nancy sucks now' ... what I imagine my greatest hater would despise most is Nancy interacting with every piece of technology using words you don't understand.\\"  Art style  Bushmiller refined and simplified his drawing style over the years to create a uniquely stylized comic world. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language illustrates its entry on comic strip with a Nancy cartoon. Despite the small size of the reproduction, both the art and the gag are clear, and an eye-tracking survey once determined that Nancy was so conspicuous that it was the first strip most people viewed on a newspaper comics page. In a 1988 essay, \\"How to Read Nancy\\", Mark Newgarden and Paul Karasik offered a probing analysis of Bushmiller's strip: Comics theorist Scott McCloud described the essence of Nancy: Cartoonist Wally Wood described Nancys design more succinctly: \\"By the time you decided not to read it, you already had.\\"  Characters  ;Primary characters Nancy and Sluggo on the cover of Tip Top number 167 (May 1951). Ernie Bushmiller's distinctive line-work was instantly recognizable. * Nancy Ritz, a typical and somewhat mischievous eight-year-old girl. She encourages her friend Sluggo to improve himself and is instantly jealous of any other girls who pay attention to him. During Gilchrists's run, she was portrayed as living in Three Rocks, Tennessee (a suburb of Nashville) although her home town was unspecified by other artists. Bushmiller located her home as 220 Oak Street next to Elm Avenue. She attends Central Elementary School in the Jaimes version.https://www.gocomics.com/nancy/2020/03/16 Aside from creating Nancy as Fritzi's niece, Bushmiller claimed to know nothing about her lineage, adding 'Very occasionally, I get curious kids asking me, but I don't know what to tell them.'Rod Mickleburgh, 'Carry On, Nancy' Vancouver Sun 28 April 1976 p. 4 * Fritzi Ritz, Nancy's paternal aunt, with whom she lives. This character was gradually phased out beginning in the mid-1980s before being dropped entirely by the end of the decade but returned as a main character in 1995 when the strip was taken over by brothers Brad and Guy Gilchrist. In the current version of Nancy, Fritzi acts as Nancy's full-time carer. * Sluggo Smith, Nancy's best friend, introduced in 1938. Sluggo is Nancy's age and is a poor ragamuffin-type from the wrong side of the tracks. He is sometimes described as Nancy's boyfriend. He is portrayed as lazy, and his favourite pastime seems to be napping; in 1976 Bushmiller told a reporter who asked how Sluggo supported himself: \\"I assume he delivers groceries on Saturday, or something like that.\\"Rod Mickleburgh, 'Carry On, Nancy' Vancouver Sun 28 April 1976 p. 4 In the Gilchrist version, Sluggo lives at 720 Drabb Street in an abandoned house he found and according to a storyline in 2013 strips, is taken care of by truck driver \\"uncles\\" Les and More, who discovered that he had lived in an orphanage; his mother died after he was born, and his father died serving his country. Sluggo's Uncle Vince is \\"shady\\" and his rich Aunt Maggie in California doesn't care about him because he reminds her of when she was poor.

Foreign versions  A January 16, 2006 strip, from the French Canadian version of Nancy. Nancy has been translated into a variety of languages, often with changes to characters' names. In Sweden, the strip is called Lisa och Sluggo. In French, Nancy is called Philom√®ne in Canada, and Zo√© in France, where the strip is called Arthur et Zo√© (Arthur being the French name of Sluggo). Nancy also appeared on the back cover of the popular Arabic children magazine Majid during the 80s, she was known as Moza while Sluggo was portrayed as her brother Rashoud. In Mexico she is known as Periquita, while Sluggo is called Tito.  Cultural references  Bushmiller's art work has inspired other artists: ;Comics * Cartoonist Bill Griffith has used the characters and emulated Bushmiller's style frequently in his Zippy the Pinhead. * Cartoonist Scott McCloud developed a card game, 5-card Nancy, in which players use random panels of Nancy to create their own stories. McCloud also included a Nancy cameo in his book, Understanding Comics.5-card Nancy When describing the \\"non-sequitur\\" transition type, several unrelated images appear between panels. One is an upside-down picture of Nancy being struck by lightning with the caption \\"Danger\\". * Cartoonist Mark Newgarden has included Nancy in his work. *Pearls Before Swine cartoonist Stephan Pastis (known for using other comic characters in his strip) portrayed Nancy and Sluggo as extras to replace Rat and Goat during the 2003 \\"Pearls Labor Dispute\\". * Mad has run several parodies, including \\"Nansy\\", in which Nancy is transformed into the main character of several other comic strips, including Donald Duck, Dick Tracy and Li'l Abner, all with that same hyphen-nose and frizzy hairdo. Also in Mad, Bushmiller gets the hardboiled treatment: \\"If Mickey Spillane Wrote Nancy\\".If Mickey Spillane Wrote Nancy * Quino's Mafalda bears a strong resemblance to the earlier Nancy, which Quino mocks in one strip, where Miguelito buys a Nancy magazine and shows it to Mafalda noticing the resemblance, only for Mafalda to retort (off-frame) that she looks more like his grandmother. * Cartoonist Max Cannon often includes Stubbo, a boy drawn in Bushmiller's style, in his Red Meat strip.https://www.redmeat.com/max-cannon/MeatLocker/?topic=2131682 ;Other media * Nancy was the subject of Andy Warhol's 1961 painting Nancy. * Nancy was the subject of several pop art works by Joe Brainard, collected in The Nancy Book (2008), Siglio Press.

Creator John Lotshaw described the process: :\\"When people ask me what Random Acts of Nancy is, I tell them it's their little daily ray of Absurdist sunshine. The lack of context-indeed, it's very removal-is what attracted me to Random Acts the moment Guy explained it to me... The process begins by skimming through Nancy daily strips. Currently, we're using Ernie Bushmiller's art exclusively, but we're not limited to his work... Once I find a strip with a promising panel, I clean up the art as much as I can in Photoshop. I remove the extra panels, and then begin coloring the art. When the panel is colored, I run a filter on the art to create the halftone dots that make the panel look as if it was printed on an old-fashioned four-color press. Finally, I flatten the image and add the indicia, including the original publication date of the strip. Repeat the process until... well, I run out of material. Thanks to the genius of Ernie Bushmiller, that's not going to happen any time soon.\\" Following Guy Gilchrist's departure from Nancy, this strip was discontinued.

Established in 1915, it was formerly known as the General Tire and Rubber Company, becoming GenCorp in 1984, and adopting its current name in April 2015. History =Background= Several decades after it began manufacturing rubber products, General Tire & Rubber diversified into broadcasting and aeronautics. In the 1940s, the Aerojet company began experimenting with various rocket designs. For a solid-fuel rocket, they needed binders, and turned to General Rubber for assistance. General became a partner in the company. Radio broadcasting began with the purchase of several radio networks starting in 1943. In 1952, its purchase of WOR-TV expanded the broadcast business into television. In 1953, General Tire & Rubber bought the RKO Radio Pictures movie studio. All of its media and entertainment holdings were organized into the RKO General division. Due to the studio and rocket businesses, General Tire & Rubber came to own a great deal of property in California. Its internal facilities management unit began commercializing its operations, landing General Tire & Rubber in the real estate business. This started when Aerojet-General Corporation acquired approximately of land in Eastern Sacramento County. Aerojet converted these former gold fields into one of the premier rocket manufacturing and testing facilities in the Western world. However, most of this land was used to provide safe buffer zones for Aerojet's testing and manufacturing operations. Later, as the need for these facilities and safety zones decreased, the property became available for other uses. Located northeast of Sacramento along US Highway 50, the properties were valuable, being in a key growth corridor in the region. Approximately of the Aerojet lands are now being planned as a community called Easton. Easton Development Company LLC was formed to assist in the process.Easton Plan Home =Name change= In 1984, General Tire created a parent holding company, GenCorp, for its various businesses. The main subsidiaries were: General Tire and Rubber; RKO General, the broadcast arm of the conglomerate; DiversiTech General, a manufacturer of tennis balls and polymer products, including automotive soundproofing and home wallpapers; and Aerojet General, a defense (missile) contractor. Through its RKO General subsidiary, the company also held stakes in: Frontier Airlines; RKO bottlers, which operated Pepsi-Cola distributorships; and several resorts and hotels, including the Westward Look resort in Tucson, Arizona. =Disconglomeration= Faced with a hostile takeover attempt, among other difficulties, GenCorp shed some of its long-held units in the late 1980s. RKO General ran into difficulties with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) during license renewal proceedings in the late 1980s. The FCC was reluctant to renew the broadcast licenses, due to widespread lying to advertisers and regulators. As a result of the protracted proceedings, GenCorp sold RKO General's broadcast properties beginning in 1987. GenCorp also sold its former flagship, General Tire, to German tire maker Continental AG in order to concentrate on Aerojet. In 1999, GenCorp spun off its Decorative & Building Products and Performance Chemicals businesses. GenCorp formed OMNOVA Solutions, Inc. into a separate, publicly traded company, and transferred those businesses into it. GenCorp's two remaining businesses, as of 2008, are Aerojet and real estate. =Aeronautics expansion= In July 2012, GenCorp agreed to buy rocket engine producer Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne from United Technologies Corporation for $550 million.Los Angeles Times; \\"Rocketdyne sold to GenCorp\\" . accessed 12.12.2012\\"Who's Where\\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, January 1, 2007 The FTC approved the deal on June 10, 2013, and it closed on June 17. Pension and bond problems GenCorp withdrew its over- funded pension during the real estate boom years of 2006 and 2007. The real estate bust caused an underfunding of the pension plan of over $300 million. This caused a freeze of its pension plan on February 1, 2009 and an end to 401k match on January 15, 2009. The move was expected to save the company 29 million a year. The under-funded pension gave the company a negative net worth of -6.88 per share as of November 30, 2009. GenCorp also is holding $142.80 million in 4% bonds due in 2010 and $147.70 million in bonds due in 2011 that the company expects to have to repurchase, as of the 2008 Annual Report. \\"In December 2009, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.0625% convertible subordinated debentures (\\"4 1/16% Debentures\\") in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers under the Securities Act of 1933. Issuance of the 4 1/16% Debentures generated net proceeds of approximately $195.0 million, a portion of which were used to repurchase $124.7 million of the 4% Notes in January 2010. The remaining proceeds will be used to redeem a portion of the 9¬Ω% senior subordinated notes (\\"9¬Ω% Notes\\"); pay accrued interest on the 4% Notes and 9¬Ω% Notes; and pay other debt issuance costs.\\" Corporate News Article In March 2010, GenCorp amended a $280 million revolving line of credit. GenCorp's former CEO J. Scott Neish resigned on January 6, 2010. He had been interim CEO from March 2008 (Terry J Hall resigned) head of the Aerojet division since November 2005. The new CEO was placed in as permanent and J. Scott Neish elected to resign from Aerojet. Scott Seymour had been the head of Northrop Grumman Integrated Systems from 2002 to 2008. GenCorp since 2008 has had significant changes in its Board of Directors and Corporate Officers, per the 2008 Annual Report: \\"On March 5, 2008, Terry L. Hall resigned as a Director and as our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Board appointed three new Directors. The Board appointed J. Scott Neish, our Vice President and President of Aerojet, to serve as our interim Chief Executive Officer and President, pending the results of a search to identify qualified candidates to fill this position on a permanent basis. On May 15, 2008, Timothy A.Wicks, Chairman of the Board, Todd R. Snyder and Sheila E. Widnall resigned as Directors of the Company. Our Board of Directors appointed James H. Perry and Thomas A.

Storms is the main fictional character in most of Tim Dorsey's novels (and appears in all of them to date). His name is a pun on storm surge. Most often described as \\"intense\\" in personality, he is a vagrant with a voracious intellect and an encyclopedic knowledge of Florida history, but prone to periods of \\"focus\\" that lead him to commit brutal - and often elaborately planned and staged - acts of violence.  Description  In most of Dorsey's books, Serge is in his mid-forties. He is described as tall and thin, but muscular, with dark hair shot through with gray. Serge has been diagnosed with a variety of mental illnesses, and has been prescribed a \\"cocktail\\" of drugs to keep him stable. These are effective, but he often refuses to take them, since he dislikes their effects. Free from the drugs' influence, he quickly becomes manic and obsessive about trivial things; he frequently acts as an extremely eccentric tour guide for whoever happens to be handy. Despite his psychological disorders, Serge is for the most part a charismatic, likeable person (he can be viewed as a somewhat more liberal version of Joseph Heller's Yossarian). When an event or person offends his extremely strong (and subjective) sense of justice, however, he can quickly fly into a homicidal rage; he has committed a string of murders for which the police pursue him as a serial killer. Serge acts as an independent vigilante who dispenses rough, creative and immediate death penalties for low-life criminals, somewhat in the style of Death Wish (and its sequels) starring Charles Bronson. All aspects of the history of Florida, whether political, ecological, or sociological, are of intense interest to Serge. He is often seized with a sudden urge to visit landmarks, although their significance is frequently personal or related to popular culture, rather than historical. Serge usually documents such visits with copious numbers of photographs and keeps a box full of Florida-related memorabilia. Serge also has a varied taste in music, ranging from modern urban to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, all of which can be described as very tasteful and fitting to his personality. A confessed coffee addict, Serge is relentlessly upbeat and energetic. He possesses a childlike sense of excitement and is almost always outgoing and friendly, even to those he murders. He often corners people at random and spouts long, stream-of- consciousness diatribes that involve Florida trivia, social commentary and/or his bizarre sexual history. In Orange Crush, while suffering a bout of amnesia, Serge (under an alias) takes a small job in the mail room of the Florida Legislature, and soon has worked his way up to being the Governor's press secretary, largely because he is the only employee in the Legislature's entire workforce that can compose speeches without spelling or grammar errors. Serge has started a personal religion based on football coach Don Shula, where salvation is obtained by successfully eating the 48-ounce steak at Shula's Steakhouse. Serge appears to be partly inspired by Travis McGee, a fictional, Florida based, independent \\"salvage consultant\\" and crime-solver featured in many novels by John D. McDonald. Age Serge was born during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He might age in real time. In Triggerfish Twist, Serge has turned 35. Nine books later, in Hurricane Punch, he's 44. Being 44 causes him to go through a midlife crisis, causing him to have a religious awakening, and to go on a comeback killing spree. Family Storms' great-great-grandfather came to the US in the 1880s from Cuba. He worked as a reader in a cigar factory in Ybor City, but left after his boss disproved of the material he was reading to the other workers. He then ran a bolita lottery for a local gang. The game was supposed to be fixed, and the gang killed him when he made a mistake in the scheme.The Stingray Shuffle Serge was named after his grandfather Sergio, a con artist who shared some of his grandson's passion for historical trivia. Sergio also seemed to share Serge's sense of ethics, as one of his last major cons involved swindling money from investors who themselves swindled the residents of a farming community in Alabama. Sergio was thought to have committed suicide when Serge was a child, but during the novel Cadillac Beach it's discovered that he is still alive. The elder Storms had a heart attack a few months before his grandson's 44th birthday, and died after a short stay in hospital.The Big Bamboo Storms' father Pablo was a Cuban American jai alai player who was more popular for his unpredictability than his skill at the sport; he died when he hurled a pelota that rebounded and struck him forcefully in the head. This occurred when Serge was very young, and left his mother a widowed single mother. She had an affair with another jai alai player from Spain, which resulted in pregnancy. Since she could barely cope with one child, and had no support from the father (he went back to Spain), she gave up her second son for adoption. Ford Oelman is Serge's half-brother, the child given up for adoption by his mother. Oelman was raised in Alabama, and did not find out about the adoption until he was an adult. He was reunited with Sergio when the older man was in Alabama, but did not meet with Serge until after their grandfather had died. Ford moved to California with his friend Mark to fulfill his ambition of becoming a screenwriter. In Electric Barracuda, it is revealed that Serge has another brother.Electric Barracuda In Torpedo Juice, Serge marries Molly, who is as crazy and unstable as he is.Torpedo Juice Throughout the remaining books, Serge is attempting to have the divorce papers signed by Molly (going so far as to have the papers in the glove compartment, ready to be signed), but has been unsuccessful so far. Companions In the books Florida Roadkill and Triggerfish Twist, Serge's companions are a cold-hearted stripper named Sharon Rhodes and an idiotic drug addict named Seymour \\"Coleman\\" Bunsen. Both of these characters appear to die in Florida Roadkill; they both return for the later novel Triggerfish Twist which takes place sometime before the events of Florida Roadkill. Coleman returns permanently in Torpedo Juice, and has been Serge's sidekick in most of the novels since. In Atomic Lobster, Serge and Coleman meet Sharon's sister, Rachael. While Coleman is presumed dead, Serge travels with Lenny Lipowicz, whom he meets in Hammerhead Ranch Motel. Lipowicz is a Don Johnson lookalike who is a stoner much like Coleman but slightly (and only slightly) more intelligent. Lenny lives with his mother and her dog, though he frequently leaves the house for days without notifying or contacting her. Aside from Hammerhead Ranch Motel, Lenny has been in Cadillac Beach and The Stingray Shuffle. He also briefly appeared in Atomic Lobster, in which he and Coleman meet at a party and indulge in their shared pathological fondness for marijuana. To date, Lenny has not appeared in any later books; it is unknown if he will ever return as a character. References Storms, Serge A.

It was the first British airborne operation conducted using Airspeed Horsa gliders, and its target was the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant in Telemark, Norway which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany. By 1942, the German nuclear weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor, but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940. When the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon. Several different strategies were discussed and discarded as impractical; it was decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider, a short distance from the plant, demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden. After an extensive training period, the airborne force took off in two aircraft‚Äìglider combinations on the night of 19 November 1942. Both the gliders and tugs were operated by aircrews attached to HQ No. 38 Wing RAF. The tugs and gliders managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but neither was able to reach their objective. The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash-landing, with its Halifax tug aircraft returning to base; three airborne troops were killed outright, with the survivors captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain after the aircraft flew low in search of the first glider. Both members of the glider crew, P/O Norman Davies (RAAF) and P/O Herbert Fraser (RAAF), were killed outright. Driver Ernest Pendlebury died soon afterwards from injuries sustained in the crash. Those who survived the crashes were captured by German forces and killed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated that any Allied personnel captured while involved in commando operations were to be executed immediately. At the end of the war Wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in the executions. Background The German government began development of an atomic weapons programme in April 1939 when two scientists, Ir√®ne and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie, declared in an issue of the scientific journal Nature DeGroot, p. 19 that atomic fission was possible and could produce immense amounts of power. The Joliot-Curies argued that not only did it have possibilities as a power source, it might also be used to create an extremely powerful weapon. By September 1941 the German scientists assigned to the programme had determined how a nuclear reactor could be developed; this required significant quantities of heavy water to act as a neutron moderator to encase the uranium which would be used to provide the material for a nuclear weapon.DeGroot, p. 26 Heavy water was extremely scarce and difficult to produce, and Germany only possessed a small amount which had been produced in laboratories. Norway possessed a large stockpile which was produced by the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant near the village of Rjukan, but the Norwegian government would not sell more than three gallons of heavy water a month, becoming suspicious of the sudden increase in demand for the water by the German government. When Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany in April 1940 this obstruction ended; the Vemork plant was captured and began producing heavy water for the German atomic weapons programme.Lynch, p. 34 Production of heavy water was slowed initially due to the effects of the fighting in Norway and a drought in the area, which led to a lack of water to provide hydroelectric power for the plant. Once the weather improved and snow began to melt, providing enough water to create sufficient hydroelectric power, production continued.Dahl, p. 147 By mid-1942 it had come to the attention of the British government that the plant had begun to produce large quantities of heavy water and was stockpiling it for later use. The decision was therefore taken that the plant and the stockpiles of heavy water would have to be destroyed in order to impede the German programme.Dahl, p. 193 Several methods for destroying the plant were considered. The first was a mass raid by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, but this was rejected due to the difficulty in locating the plant during night bombing, the principal bombing tactic used by the RAF at the time, and the heavy casualties that would be inflicted on the local Norwegian population during a night raid. An attack by Norwegian saboteurs was also ruled out, as was landing troops by PBY Catalina flying boat on Lake M√∏svatn, from the target, the latter due to the steepness of the surrounding mountain slopes and the inability of flying boats to land on the ice.Mears, p. 73 It was decided that a raid by glider-borne airborne troops would have the greatest chance of success. The area around the plant would be difficult to land on, but a possible landing site for gliders was located near the M√∏svatn dam, although it would require considerable skill on the part of the glider pilots in order to land safely. Preparations =Operation Grouse= In March 1942 the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) had recruited Einar Skinnarland, a Norwegian engineer who worked at the M√∏svatn dam. Skinnarland had successfully sailed to Britain and was parachuted back to Telemark after ten days of intensive training.Mears, pp. 23‚Äì24 Having several contacts within Vemork he was able to roughly identify the disposition of German troops and other defences.Mears, p. 42 Additionally SOE decided to send an advance party of Norwegian agents into Telemark, and began intensively training a four-man team over the summer. The party, code-named Operation Grouse, was led by Jens-Anton Poulsson and also included Knut Haugland, Claus Helberg and Arne Kjelstrup.Mears, p. 47 The Norwegians, all people local to the area with exceptional outdoors skills,Mears, pp. 27‚Äì30 underwent extra outdoor training in Scotland as well as learning the skills necessary to operate in occupied territory; including sabotage, radio transmitting and \\"irregular warfare\\".Mears, p. 36 The Grouse team were ready to be inserted by October. Several flights were made but aborted due to bad weather, before the team finally dropped on 18 October.Mears, p. 46 The team landed at Fjarifet on the Hardangervidda (a large wilderness avoided by the German forces)Mears, p. 48 and spent the next 15 days trekking towards M√∏svatn, where they made contact with Skinnarland's brother, Torstein.Mears, p. 61 Once they had established contact with London the party began making preparations for the arrival of the British commandos. A suitable glider landing site was chosen south west of M√∏svatn damMears, p. 63 and the team reconnoitred the area to help Combined Operations decide the best way to attack the plant.Mears, p. 70 German defences The geography of the area around the village and the plant meant that attacking the plant and destroying the existing stocks of heavy water would be extremely difficult. Both were situated in a deep valley which possessed thickly‚Äìforested sides that rose almost vertically from a narrow river‚Äìbed, and which was overlooked by Gaustatoppen, a mountain approximately high; the plant itself had been built on a broad rock shelf above the river bed.Otway, p. 70 Einar Skinnarland had observed the German defences over the summer and passed the information back to SOE. Later reconnaissance by Torstein Skinnerland and the Grouse team was also transmitted to London in the weeks leading up to the operation.Mears, p. 68 In early October Generaloberst Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, the commander in chief of the German forces in Norway, had visited the plant.Mears, p. 69 While there he warned the local garrison that he believed the plant was a likely target for British commando raids, but crucially he did not have the resources to increase the manpower there. Although Einar Skinnarland had observed a garrison of 100 men in the village of Rjukan, 20 at the dam and about 55 near the main plant during the summer, by October this had been reduced to about 12 at the plant, 12 at the dam and approximately 40 in Rjukan. Most of the men were elderly or infirm Austrians under the command of an elderly captain, although well trained German regulars periodically passed through Telemark. Skinnarland also believed that Gestapo agents were in the area. The Germans had erected three iron hawsers across the valley to prevent low flying bombing raids but on the ground most of their defences were positioned to prevent an assault from the ridge above the plant, the direction from which they believed an attack was most likely. Minefields and booby traps predominantly protected this side of the plant, but there were also searchlights on the roof and a machine gun nest near the entrance. A single bridge crossed the steep gorge in front of the plant, but was normally only protected by two guards. There were 300,000 German troops in Norway at this time and reinforcements could quickly be called into the area, which would complicate the commandos' escape to the Swedish border. =Planning= The Headquarters staff of Combined Operations at the War Office was tasked with devising a plan for the glider-borne assault on the plant, as it had been with previous airborne and commando operations, such as Operation Biting. This was the first British airborne operation ever to use gliders; all previous operations had been conducted solely with parachutists.Otway, p. 73 The staff decided that although gliders would be the most suitable for the operation due to the heavy loads to be carried by the airborne troops, and the possibility that they could be widely dispersed if they were dropped by parachute, the airborne troops would still be trained for a possible parachute insertion if the landing zone for the gliders was found to be unsuitable. Because of the complicated and technical nature of the operation, which would see the plant rigged with explosives and then detonated, it was believed that a minimum of twelve to sixteen men was required, and that they would all have to be skilled engineers. The important nature of the operation also led to the force being doubled in order to duplicate it, to ensure that even if half of the force were killed, the survivors would have the necessary skills to complete the operation.Lynch, p. 35 The selected troops were volunteer parachutists chosen from the sappers of 9th Field Company (Airborne) Royal Engineers and 261st Field Park Company (Airborne) Royal Engineers attached to 1st Airborne Division, because the only parachute-trained Royal Engineers unit in existence at the time, 1st Parachute Squadron Royal Engineers, was already deployed in North Africa with 1st Parachute Brigade.Otway, p. 71 Both of the duplicated units that were to participate in the operation were to be commanded by officers from the Royal Engineers; the first by Lieutenant A.C. Allen and the second by Second- Lieutenant M.D. Green, who was later replaced by Lieutenant D.A. Methven when he was injured during a training accident three days before the operation was to begin. The Vemork hydroelectric plant in snow in 2008 The Royal Air Force unit selected to transport the sappers was 38 Wing, which was commanded by Group Captain T.B. Cooper; it was provided with a special allotment of three Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers for the operation, which were the only British aircraft in existence at the time which were capable of towing Horsa gliders the distance required and then returning to their base. The SOE agents selected a landing zone for the sappers, which was approximately from the Norsk Hydro plant and could not be observed by German patrols.Wiggan, p. 50 The plan for the operation called for the sappers to land in the two gliders at the landing zone, guided in by the SOE agents equipped with Eureka radio beacons. Once they had successfully landed, the sappers would be escorted to the plant by the SOE agents, demolish the plant and its stocks of heavy water, and then cross the Norwegian border into neutral Sweden. Combined Operations initially suggested the men should fight their way to the Swedish border, but MI9 believed their chances of survival were better if they attempted to disguise themselves as Norwegians and travel in pairs.Mears, p. 76 In order to facilitate their escape the men were provided with civilian clothes (to be worn after the operation),Mears, p. 77 simple Norwegian phrases (in the hope no German they encountered would speak Norwegian)Mears, p. 78 and escape sets containing money and maps. They were also ordered to shave any moustaches and grow their hair long in order to blend in with Norwegian men. =Training= Training began in early October in Wales and was designed to be extremely arduous, not only to ensure that those who took part were at the peak of their physical and mental fitness, but also to eliminate any men unable to cope with the long marches and difficult terrain that would be encountered during the operation.Harclerode, p. 221 When this portion of the training had been completed, the sappers were then transferred to the area around Fort William in Scotland, where they were familiarised with a hydroelectric plant similar in design to the one in Norway, and received training on the most efficient way to plant explosives in the Norsk Hydro plant to cause maximum damage. Training also took place at Port Sunlight, where they were shown how to destroy large condensers of the kind found in the plant. The sappers were given detailed briefings on the plant and the surrounding area, and were trained on large models and mock-ups of the buildings that the plant was composed of, all based on information provided by the SOE agents who had arrived earlier in the month. Because the operation was considered to be extremely important, and its results vital to the Allied war effort, security efforts were extremely thorough. A cover story was provided for the sappers as they conducted their training; a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of American engineers in a fictional 'Washington Cup' athletic event, which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute, followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding endurance test.Mears, p. 75 The departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non-essential military personnel, and all mail and telephone calls were censored. Operation After their training had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to RAF Skitten, Killimster in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later.Otway, p. 72 On the evening of 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, with the aid of a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the operation that night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely.Dahl, p. 342 The first aircraft‚Äìglider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective. =The first combination= The first combination flew through poor weather conditions and managed to reach Norway and fly towards its objective. During the flight over Norway the Rebecca receiver, which was supposed to pick up the transponder signal from the Eureka beacons being used by the Norwegian SOE agents, developed a mechanical problem and was unable to pick up the signal. This left the aircrew with only map-reading available to locate the landing zone, but the poor weather made this almost impossible. On a second attempt to find the correct area, the combination flew into thick clouds approximately northwest of Rjukan, and ice began to form on both aircraft and glider, as well as the towing rope connecting the two. At this point the combination began to lose altitude, and the towing rope snapped, setting the glider free; low on fuel, the aircraft was forced to turn back after signaling to Skitten at 23:55 that it had released the glider, and only just succeeded in landing back in Britain. Shortly after releasing the glider, the aircraft broadcast a second message, \\"Glider in sea\\", indicating the air crew's belief that the glider had crashed. The Royal Navy was asked to begin a search-and-rescue mission, but had no ships in the area; an aerial search of the area was instead conducted, but did not find the glider.Wiggan, p. 54 The glider crash- landed in an area called Fyljesdal, overlooking Lysefjord.Mears, p. 85 Of the seventeen men on board, three were killed outright. Thorvald Fylgjedalen, a local farmer, found some of the injured soldiers from the glider, but knew no English, and was unable to communicate with them. Nonetheless, Fylgjedalen and his neighbour Jonas Haaheller decided that they would assist the wounded soldiers, and did not contact the German authorities.Wiggan, pp. 62‚Äì63 After contacting more of the local residents, the soldiers asked for their assistance in escaping to Sweden, but Haaheller and others convinced them that this would be impossible, as it would involve travelling across the entirety of Norway. Thus, the Norwegians sheltered and gave medical attention to the injured soldiers, but did not allow any of them to leave.Wiggan, pp. 64‚Äì66 The Norwegians also burned all of the maps and documents from the glider crash before the Germans could arrive, and managed to keep the entire operation secret for almost twenty-four hours.Wiggan, pp. 66‚Äì67 German soldiers, including troops from both the Waffen SS and the Army, arrived the next afternoon on two boats from a nearby camp. They took the British soldiers prisoner, and departed with them on the boats. Despite the grave injuries suffered by some of the soldiers, they were still forced to walk under their own power and ride in the unsheltered boats in the cold.Wiggan, p. 68 The dead soldiers were buried in a shallow grave.Mears, p. 86 =The second combination= The second combination managed to reach the coast of Norway, but fared even worse than the first combination; because of a turn in the weather,Wiggan, p. 59 the tow aircraft (second Halifax) piloted by Flight Lieutenant Roland Parkinson, RCAF,Wiggan, p. 53 released the glider and then crashed into a mountain at Hestadfjell in high winds, rain and hail.Mears, p. 90 All of the aircrew were killed instantly. Workmen in the area heard the plane pass overhead shortly before crashing and alerted the German authorities, who arrived quickly. Finding no survivors, the Germans threw the bodies of the aircrew into a nearby bog and left the area.Wiggan, p. 62 Released just before the tow aircraft crashed, the second glider spiralled out of control and crash-landed in the mountains between Helleland and Bjerkreim.Mears, p. 89 The two RAAF pilot and copilot of the glider, Norman Davies and Herbert Fraser, were killed instantly and the rest were injured to varying degrees, one of whom, 25 year old Driver Ernest Pendlebury, died soon after.Wiggan, p. 64 The survivors were unwilling to leave the seriously wounded and two of the British soldiers left the crash site to search for help. After searching for some time, they arrived in the hamlet of Helleland about from where they had crashed, and made contact with one of the local residents, Trond Hovland. The soldiers told Hovland about their injured comrades, and asked if he could help them find a doctor. Hovland agreed to help, but informed them that the nearest doctor lived away, in the town of Egersund. In order to contact him, Hovland would have to use the telephone system, controlled by the German authorities, which would alert them to the presence of the soldiers. Believing that there was no alternative, the soldiers agreed to contact the Germans, expecting that they would be taken as prisoners of war.Wiggan, pp. 59‚Äì60 A party from the Norwegian Labour Service arrived at the crash site shortly afterwards and helped tend to the injured soldiers who burned all of their sensitive documents and materials. A German party arrived about twenty minutes later. Unwilling to abandon the wounded and doubting their chances of escaping to Sweden, Lieutenant Allen chose to surrender, believing that they would be treated as POWs. Underneath their uniforms, the soldiers wore civilian clothing and had been told to grow their hair and beards. With this, and the fact that sabotage equipment was found, Colonel Probst, the head of the Wehrmacht in the Stavanger district, had all survivors executed as partisans at the German camp at Sletteb√∏ near Egersund.Wiggan, pp. 60‚Äì61 Aftermath The Allies were unaware of the fate of the operation until they intercepted a German communiqu√© stating that two gliders and one aircraft had been forced down, and the crews engaged and annihilated.Mears, p. 84 On 11 December they received a message from an SOE agent explaining that the second glider's occupants had all been shot.Mears, p. 87 Many of the details about the fate of the two glider combinations were only discovered after the war had ended. None of the soldiers or aircrew who survived the crashes remained alive for very long. Of the soldiers from the first glider, three of the four injured men were tortured by the Gestapo and later killed by a doctor who injected air into their bloodstreams. The fourth injured man was shot in the back of the head the next day. All four bodies were dumped at sea. The five uninjured men were held at Grini concentration camp until 18 January 1943, when they were taken to nearby woods, blindfolded and executed by the Gestapo. The German Wehrmacht and the Gestapo argued over the fate of the prisoners from the second glider.Mears, p. 88 The Wehrmacht believed they should be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention, but in the end the survivors were interrogated and executed within a few hours of their capture at the German barracks at Bekkeb√∏. They were taken into nearby woods and shot one by one, each being forced to listen to the man before him being executed. Their bodies were stripped and thrown into an unmarked grave. All of the executions were conducted in accordance with the Commando Order issued by Adolf Hitler in October 1942, which stated that all Commando troops were to be killed immediately upon capture. The local Norwegian population were unable to prevent the prisoners being executed, but tended the graves of the dead until the end of the war. Although the Allied soldiers believed that they had burnt all of their maps, one from the second glider was missed. When the Germans found it they were able to identify the Vemork plant as the target and increased their defence accordingly.Mears, p. 94 German reprisals started instantly and 200 armed Gestapo agents swept into Rjukan where they arrested 21 Norwegians for questioning,Mears, p. 92 but the members of Operation Grouse slipped away into the wilderness of Hardangervidda. They later contributed to the successful Operation Gunnerside in February 1943, when a small team of Norwegian SOE agents were parachuted into the area and demolished much of the Vemork heavy water plant.Dahl, p. 204 The plant eventually resumed operation, but further bombing raids ensured it produced little heavy water for the German atomic weapons programme.Dahl, p. 236 Although the operation had been a failure, it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations. This included developing a new version of the Rebecca-Eureka homing device system, the Mk II, which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.Otway, p. 406 The Vemork Hydroelectric Plant as it looks today. Heavy water production took place in the now demolished Hydrogen Production Plant, formerly situated to the left (i.e. in front) of the building in the picture. When 1st Airborne Division arrived in Norway in May 1945, they were informed of the fate of the prisoners, and cooperated with the Norwegian government to have the men buried with full military honours. The five from the first glider were re-interred at the Commonwealth War Graves plot at Vestre Gravlund near Oslo. The second glider's occupants were reburied at Eiganes churchyard in Stavanger and the Halifax aircrew were reburied at Helleland.Mears, p. 91 The head of the Gestapo in Oslo, who had signed the order for the prisoners' executions, killed himself several days prior to 1st Airborne Division's arrival in May 1945, but several Wehrmacht personnel implicated in the decision to execute the prisoners were put on trial and found guilty; one was shot and another hanged, whilst a senior Non-Commissioned Officer who had shot a prisoner in the back of the head was extradited to the Soviet Union for alleged abuse conducted against Soviet prisoners. The commander of the German forces in Norway ‚Äì Generaloberst Nikolaus von Falkenhorst ‚Äì was also found guilty of two of the Freshman deaths during his war crimes trial.

Storms. Plot summary Jim Davenport is transferred to his company's branch in Tampa, Florida. He and his wife Martha are initially excited by the move and the beauty of their new neighborhood on Triggerfish Lane, but the reality proves to be disturbing: the Davenports' neighbors are a strange bunch of eccentrics, and crime is much worse than they had thought. These neighbors eventually include brutal-but-charismatic criminal Serge Storms, spiteful cocaine-addicted stripper Sharon Rhodes, and drug addict Seymour \\"Coleman\\" Bunsen, who move into the rental home across from the Davenports after Sharon and Coleman's brainless antics accidentally burn down Serge's home. Jim's troubles begin while he is waiting in a bank drive-through, when an armed robber mistakes Jim's Suburban for his getaway vehicle and jumps in, threatening Jim and his infant daughter with a gun. Jim manages to overpower the robber, breaking his neck when a faulty airbag inflates in his face. Jim does not know that the robber was the youngest of five brothers, and the remaining four are released from prison on a technicality and begin looking for revenge. FDLE Agent Mahoney, obsessed with capturing Serge, convinces his boss to let him travel to Tampa, ostensibly to warn Jim. When Jim returns to work, his consulting employer is acquired by a different company, which alters its corporate policy to make Jim the primary scapegoat for corporate layoffs. Jim is unable to adjust to his new role and is eventually fired. Serge, despite his criminal lifestyle, develops a great liking and admiration for Jim, even considering proposing marriage to Sharon to emulate Jim's success as a family man. Jim likes Serge as well, but Martha senses something strange about Serge and orders him to stay away. At least three subplots intertwine with and lead up to the novel's climax: *While browsing the library at the University of Tampa, Serge is mistaken for a professor, and his impromptu lectures on Florida history and culture become so popular among the student body that the Dean asks Serge to deliver the commencement address. *John Milton, a substitute teacher turned bank teller turned car salesman, is fired from his last job and decides to take revenge on Jim, the person assigned official blame for his firing from the bank. *Ambrose Tarrington III, a bankrupt former millionaire, lives in a small house on Triggerfish Lane, but mimics the attitude of wealth so well that he is constantly treated to test drives of luxury cars, free lunches from eager bank executives, and the use of mansions being offered for sale. Mistaking Ambrose's act for reality, Serge kidnaps him for ransom. Events come to a head at the Davenports' Fourth of July costume party, which includes the four criminal McGraw brothers taking the party hostage and Serge and Mahoney reluctantly teaming up to save the guests. Jim, normally passive to a fault, is driven to defend his family by snatching a gun and shooting two of the brothers. The novel ends with the principal characters being featured on an episode of the Bill Maher show, which Serge (on the run from the police and still pursuing the $5 million briefcase featured in Florida Roadkill) calls into to express his sincere admiration for men with wives and children, declaring it a tougher job than anything Serge has had to cope with.  Continuity  *The book takes place in the summer of 1997, somewhere in the midst of the events of Florida Roadkill; at the end of that novel, both Coleman and Sharon are dead. *Several characters from Triggerfish Twist, including the Davenports, reappear in Atomic Lobster, taking place approximately ten years later.

The Movie is an American direct-to-video animated science fiction comedy film produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and Rough Draft Korea, released on August 26, 2003. It is the second film released in the Lilo & Stitch franchise and the third film chronologically, taking place after the 2002 first film and (by later extension) the 2005 direct-to-video sequel Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch. The film also serves as the backdoor pilot of the spin-off sequel series Lilo & Stitch: The Series, which debuted the following month. The story is an introduction to Dr. Jumba Jookiba's 625 experiments (made prior to Stitch) that he created with the financing of Dr. Jacques von H√§msterviel. Plot In deep space, ex-captain Gantu is in his new spaceship after his original one got destroyed in the first film and is hired by an alien named Dr. Jacques von H√§msterviel to retrieve the other 625 experiments. On Earth, Stitch is still not fitting in and causes another disaster. Lilo tries to encourage him by saying he's one-of-a-kind, comparing him to Frankenstein's monster, which just makes him feel worse. Suddenly, a crash is heard, and the pair encounter Gantu breaking into their home. Stitch confronts Gantu, who blasts Stitch into a net. Gantu then finds and takes a blue pod with the number 625 on it, abducting Jumba for interrogation. Stitch and Lilo take Jumba's spaceship and chase Gantu into outer space, engaging him in battle, only to be defeated and fall back towards Earth. Back at their house, Lilo, Stitch and Pleakley find the container Jumba was hiding. Pleakley realizes that these are the other 625 experiments, in dehydrated form, and warns them not to tell anyone or put the experiments in water. Deliberately disobeying Pleakley's orders, Stitch and Lilo retrieve the container and hydrate one of the experiments, Experiment 221, who promptly escapes into the night. Jumba is being held captive on the ship of Dr. H√§msterviel, who is surprisingly revealed to be a small creature with the combination of a hamster, poodle and rabbit. Unable to intimidate Jumba, H√§msterviel activates another experiment, Experiment 625, to attack him. Although 625 has some of Stitch's powers, he is incredibly lazy and a terrible coward, prioritizing and making sandwiches above all else. Meanwhile, Pleakley is able to call H√§msterviel's ship via telephone. H√§msterviel tells Pleakley that he wants a ransom of the other 624 experiments in return for Jumba. When Pleakley informs the other family members what the ransom is, Nani proceeds to call Cobra Bubbles about the problem while Lilo and Stitch go out to find 221. When Cobra arrives the next morning, he seems to already know about what happened. Meanwhile, Stitch and Lilo finally manage to catch a troublesome Experiment 221 at a nearby hotel with a glass vase and soon befriend him. The rendezvous time arrives and Pleakley and Cobra show up with the container, not knowing that it contains only 623 experiments. Pleakley hands the container over to H√§msterviel, who is shocked to find that one is missing. Lilo then shows up with Experiment 221 trapped in the vase. Announcing that she has named it \\"Sparky\\", she says that Sparky is part of Stitch's, and thus her, ohana. Furious, H√§msterviel tells her to give him the experiment or Jumba will die. After several moments of thinking and hearing Cobra, Pleakley, Jumba and H√§msterviel persuading them, Lilo and Stitch set Sparky free and break Jumba from his bonds. On Cobra's signal, the Grand Councilwoman's ship rises out of the nearby ocean and aims several guns at H√§msterviel to obliterate him. Lilo protests, saying that H√§msterviel has the other experiments while Sparky overhears this. Sparky then proceeds to use his electrical abilities to blow the power on the Councilwoman's ship, while H√§msterviel and Gantu climb back aboard their own ship with the captured experiments. In a last attempt to stop H√§msterviel, Lilo, Stitch and Sparky stow away on it as it leaves Earth. Inside the ship, Lilo and Stitch manage to swipe the container with the other experiments in it. The struggle for the container between Lilo, Stitch and Gantu results in releasing the dehydrated pods to rain down and scatter throughout Hawaii. Having captured the two, H√§msterviel reveals his plans to clone Stitch a thousand times over and orders Gantu to do what he wants with Lilo. While Gantu puts Lilo in a teleportation pod to send her to an intergalactic zoo, Stitch is strapped to a weight just heavier than he can lift. Watching as Stitch tries to avoid being vivisected by a laser for the cloning process, Sparky shows that he has reformed by short-circuiting the cloning machine. He then breaks Stitch free from his bonds and the two strap H√§msterviel to the device before they rescue Lilo. Having locked H√§msterviel in handcuffs, Lilo, Stitch, and Sparky short-circuit Gantu's ship, causing it to crash near a waterfall on Kauai. Landing H√§msterviel's ship back at the rendezvous point, they give Sparky a new home powering Kƒ´lauea Lighthouse, which hasn't been running in years because powering it was very expensive. They then persuade the Grand Councilwoman to let them rehabilitate the other 623 experiments. The Councilwoman places H√§msterviel under arrest, and Jumba whispers to Pleakley that he has plans for making Experiment 627. At that moment, Experiments 202, 529, 455, 489, and 390 are activated, beginning the events of the series. Later, Jumba and Pleakley hope to go home with the Grand Councilwoman this time, but they are left stranded on Earth once again. Voice cast * Chris Sanders as Stitch a.k.a.

Stitch! The Movie serves as the lead-in to Lilo & Stitch: The Series. The film's original title was going to be Lilo & Stitch: A New Ohana. At some point, there was a decision to only have Stitch's name in the titles of both the movie and the subsequent series, which was planned to be called Stitch! The Series. Eventually, this was abolished, resulting in both this film and The Series having mismatched names. The Stitch! name (with exclamation point) would be used as the title for an anime series five years after this film's release. Critical reception The film currently holds a 20% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 5 reviews. In a 2019 list of direct-to-video sequels, prequels, and \\"mid-quels\\" to Disney animated films, Petrana Radulovic of Polygon ranked Stitch! The Movie tenth out of twenty-six films, the lowest of the Lilo & Stitch sequel films on her list. Radulovic wrote that she liked the message of Stitch finding his family, but criticized it for not being as funny as the original Lilo & Stitch film, stating that \\"some of the [mundane] charm of Lilo & Stitch[...]is lost in favor of chasing a new alien [Sparky] and introducing the rabbitlike villain [H√§msterviel] who just wants world domination.\\" In a similar list in 2020, Lisa Wehrstedt of Insider ranked Stitch! The Movie seventeenth out of twenty-five films, also the lowest of the Lilo & Stitch sequels on her list. Wehrstedt wrote that she believed the film's premise did not warrant a full feature film, and its finale was too \\"open-ended\\" to have Stitch! The Movie \\"work as a stand-alone film like the rest of the Lilo & Stitch sequels.\\" However, she nonetheless claimed that \\"everything in the Lilo & Stitch world has an irresistible charm that propels it up many ranks considering what its plot and animation quality would be able to achieve without a bunch of cute little monsters.\\" Notes References External links * * Category:2003 films Category:2003 animated films Category:2003 direct-to-video films Category:2000s American animated films Category:American children's animated comic science fiction films Category:American films Category:American sequel films Category:Direct- to-video sequel films Category:Disney direct-to-video animated films Category:Films about children Category:Films set in Hawaii Category:Lilo & Stitch Category:Television films as pilots Category:Films scored by Michael Tavera Category:Films scored by Alan Silvestri Category:Rough Draft Studios films Category:Disney Television Animation films ","title":"Stitch!

Three of the six AM stations had the letters \\"DX\\" within their call signs, such as WDXI in Jackson, Tennessee, WDXE-AM-FM, Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, and WDXN, Clarksville, Tennessee. These letters gave rise to usage of the term \\"Dixie Stations.\\" Headquartered in Jackson, Tennessee, the stations were incorporated as separate corporations. Each one founded by Aaron B. Robinson, Sr., principal owner and chief executive officer. The stations were: WCMA-AM, Corinth, Mississippi, 1946; WENK-AM, Union City, Tennessee, 1947; WDXI-AM, Jackson, Tennessee, 1948; WDXE-AM, Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, 1951; WTPR-AM, Paris, Tennessee, 1953; WDXN-AM, Clarksville, Tennessee, 1954, and WDXI-TV, Jackson, Tennessee, 1954. WDXI-TV was sold to Bahakel Broadcasting Corporation, Charlotte, North Carolina in 1966. The call sign became WBBJ-TV at that time. Dixie Network stations were known for a high degree of professionalism for small market operations. Always focused on local news and local community events the stations and their personnel were known and respected for civic awareness and contributions. Mr. Robinson, 55 years of age, died unexpectedly in December, 1961. Under his Will & Testament Robinson Enterprises, including Dixie Network Stations, were administered by the Trust Department of the former National Bank of Commerce, Jackson, Tennessee. J. Kenneth (Ken) Marston, manager of network station WDXE, Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, was chosen by stockholders and National Bank of Commerce to assume general management of the Dixie Network beginning January, 1962. In addition to community service by the respective stations management was known for participation in radio industry efforts beyond their station responsibilities. John E. Bell, manager, WCMA, Corinth, Mississippi served as President of the Mississippi Broadcast Association. J. Kenneth Marston, Sr. served as President of the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters. Still later, WDXI manager Charles R. Simms, served as President of the Tennessee Association of Broadcasters. Marston also was elected to the National Association of Broadcasters Board of Directors in 1970 Edward B. Fritts, who began his broadcast career at WENK, Union City, Tennessee, was elected President of The National Association of Broadcasters, Washington, D.C., where he led the national trade association with distinction.

The stations signed on by playing \\"Dixie.\\" Each Dixie Network station was sold under favorable conditions and concluded by close of business December 31, 1973. At that time Ken Marston was chosen by Tennessee radio and television broadcasters to transition The Tennessee Association of Broadcasters into a full-time trade association and establish its office and operations in Nashville, Tennessee.

History  Royal Earlswood Hospital c.1854 Ann Serena Plumbe took an interest in the plight of the learning disabled, or \\"idiots\\" as they were termed at the time, and began to discuss what could be done to assist them in 1847. In discussion with Dr John Conolly (of the Hanwell Asylum) and Rev Dr Andrew Reed (a philanthropist and founder of several orphanages) they determined to educate such people. Reed toured Europe to gather information on institutions serving the purpose and in October the project to found The Asylum for Idiots, as it was originally called, began with the appointment of a board of management. A property known as Park House in Highgate was purchased in March 1848 and the first patients were admitted in April 1848. The building became too small and a purpose-built facility was commissioned. Queen Victoria subscribed 250 guineas in the name of the Prince of Wales who became a life member. The hospital was designed by William Bonython Moffat and built by John Jay. Prince Albert took a special interest from the beginning. He laid the foundation stone in June 1853 and opened the Asylum in June 1855. In 1862 Queen Victoria conferred a Royal charter on the asylum. A notable inmate in the early years of the asylum was James Henry Pullen who carved wonderful works of art and built detailed models, including one of Brunel's ship Great Eastern. John Langdon Down (after whom Down syndrome was named) was medical superintendent of the hospital from 1855 to 1868. At this time patients slept in fifteen-bed dormitories and there was one member of staff to each seven patients. Tuberculosis accounted for the majority of deaths in the institution. Two new wings were completed in 1873. The asylum was renamed The Royal Earlswood Institution for Mental Defectives in June 1926. Katherine and Nerissa Bowes- Lyon, who were nieces of the Queen Mother and first cousins of the Queen, were placed in the hospital in 1941. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948. Following the introduction of Care in the Community, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in March 1997. The site was redeveloped for residential use and is now known as Royal Earlswood Park. A number of the buildings are listed buildings: these include the main building, the workshopThe workshop at English Heritage and the gate lodges.The lodges at English Heritage The Royal Earlswood Museum The Royal Earlswood Museum was located at the Belfry Shopping Centre nearby in Redhill. It illustrated the history and development of the asylum and contained works of James Henry Pullen (1835‚Äì1916). The museum is now closed and in 2012 its collections and artefacts were donated to the Langdon Down Museum of Learning Disability in Teddington, Richmond upon Thames. The museum's archives are located in the Surrey History Centre in Woking.

Storms. It was published in 1999 by William Morrow and Company, an imprint of HarperCollins. Plot summary Roadkill is set in 1997, against the backdrop of that year's World Series in which the Florida Marlins won a stunning upset in Miami, Florida. The book begins in media res, with the discovery of three corpses in South Florida, the murders of whom are eventually detailed as the book fills in the events precipitating them, starting eleven months before the World Series.  Synopsis  Intelligent but sociopathic criminal Serge Storms meets up with heartless stripper Sharon Rhodes and brainless drug addict Seymore \\"Coleman\\" Bunsen, who become his travelling companions and partners in crime. After one of Sharon's customers, an oversexed orthodontist named George Veale, brags that his hands are insured for $5 million, Serge hatches a plan to defraud the insurance company and steal the entire settlement from Veale. The injury inflicted on Veale's hand (by a chainsaw) is grisly enough to convince the insurance company to pay out, but Veale panics, withdraws the entire amount from the bank, and hides the suitcase containing the cash in the trunk of a rental car being driven by two vacationing friends, Sean and David. Before Veale can retrieve the case, he is kidnapped by Serge and Co., who tie him up in a Cape Canaveral motel and kill him with an elaborate Rube Goldberg-type booby trap triggered by the vibrations of the nearby launch of the Space Shuttle Columbia. Further complications arise when it is revealed that the insurance company is actually bankrupt of legitimate earnings, and the money paid to Veale was earmarked for delivery to a minor cocaine cartel. In a panic, the CEO of the company, Charles Saffron, details a private investigator and a series of bounty hunters to track down the suitcase, while himself evading a squad of enforcers sent by the cartel. As they close in on the money, and already weary of the other's company, Serge and Sharon each separately decide to kill the other. Serge ambushes Sharon first, suffocating her by spraying liquid tire sealant down her throat. Later, the enforcers storm Serge and Coleman's hotel room in Key West, killing Coleman but missing Serge, who kills two of the three enforcers and escapes with a non-lethal gunshot wound. The last enforcer is killed by detective Susan Tchoupitoulas, who has been tracking Serge and Coleman. When Susan confronts Serge in the hotel's lobby, he recognizes her as the daughter of a Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputy whose life he saved thirteen years ago. Serge discards his own gun and walks out of the lobby, wagering (correctly) that Susan will not shoot an unarmed man. A comic subplot deals with three bikeless bikers ‚Äî Stinky, Ringworm and Cheese-Dick ‚Äî who have been rejected from every biker group they have encountered and are on the down and out. They find an odd sort of niche as hired muscle in a retirement community, but are ultimately forced out by the community's owner, who wants the seniors kept as miserable as possible to extort money from them. The three bikers spend several days aboard a yacht on loan from the owner, but are marooned as soon as they have exhausted the engine's fuel (having no grasp of sailing or marine navigation). Stinky accidentally shoots Cheese-Dick with a flare gun while rummaging through the yacht's emergency gear, and a short while later, Ringworm and Stinky are both abducted by another boater, who ties them to cinder blocks and drowns them at sea. A second, more serious subplot follows Sean and David, unaware of the $5 million in the trunk of their car, on their unsuccessful fishing trip to Key West, which includes stopping in Miami to watch the final game of the World Series. Saffron, believing he has finally found the drug money, follows them on their sight-seeing trip to Fort Jefferson, but all three of them are abducted by the same boater, who turns out to be Max Minimum, the disgraced manager of the retirement community, and secretly a perverted serial killer. Minimum pushes Saffron and Sean overboard, but David overpowers him with a head butt, causing Minimum to choke to death on the Barbie doll he had wedged in his mouth. Saffron drowns, but David deliberately tips himself and his cinder block overboard, managing to save both Sean and himself. After they return to Key West, Susan takes their statements, then treats them to dinner, where she and David develop an attraction to each other. They drive home, still unaware that the $5 million is concealed in the trunk of their car, or that Serge is still feverishly searching the county for them. = Johnny Vegas = Several of Dorsey's novels feature one or more failed attempts by his recurring character, Johnny Vegas, to finally lose his virginity. In this novel, Johnny regularly trolls the seaside parties of South Beach in a Cigarette boat whose colors mislead spectators into thinking it belongs to Dan Marino: *Johnny lures a young college coed onto his boat and is close to having sex with her, when she sees a bloated corpse float up with a chain around his neck (later revealed to be that of either Stinky or Ringworm); *While Serge, Coleman and Sharon are touring South Beach, Sharon hitches a ride on Johnhy's boat, and offers to have sex with him, but they are interrupted when a miniature caiman, that Serge bought at a gift shop and Coleman mistakenly placed in their hotel's freezer, thaws out and bites her ankle ferociously. She blames Johnny for the snafu and re-joins Serge and Coleman.  Continuity  *A number of minor characters (such as Bradley Xeno, the boat captain, and McJagger, the retirement community operator) make minor appearances in the following book, Hammerhead Ranch Motel, which also features a passing reference to Stinky, Cheese-Dick and Ringworm. *Dorsey's later novel Triggerfish Twist was published three years later, but the events of that novel take place at some unspecified point during the events of Florida Roadkill (as Dorsey's web site puts it, he didn't know what he was doing and killed too many characters he later decided he needed).

The book is set in a dystopian United States where civil war has broken out between different political, racial and gendered groups. A dark satire, the book parodies primitive notions of gender, sexual difference and identity from a post-feminist perspective. Other major themes include sadomasochism and the politics of power. Plot summary At the start of the novel, Evelyn, a male English professor, is taking up a new post in a university in New York. His tribute to Tristessa de St Ange, a (fictional) American silent movie star, on his last night in England is to be given fellatio by a girl he takes to see one of her films. He arrives in a dystopian New York, a city in its last stages of rotting death, overrun by huge rats and human emotions distilled to their most primeval. The job that he has been offered at a university falls through after the school is taken over by a militant black rebel group. He is then left destitute in the middle of New York with very little money and no job. Evelyn then befriends a Czech neighbour, Baroslav, who is an alchemist. Baroslav is killed by a group of men in the city and Evelyn is then left alone. On a late night run to the local drug store he meets Leilah. He becomes fascinated with Leilah, an exotic young African American night club dancer, and he follows her home through the city. He lives with her and they have a short sexual relationship where he frequently abuses her. He makes no emotional link, seeing her only in terms of sex. He writes to his parents and finds out that he is left a lot of money from a recently deceased relative. He becomes repelled by Leilah after he impregnated her, and he then abandons her to a voodoo abortionist. The abortion goes wrong and Leilah is put in hospital. Evelyn is expected to pay a large fee for Leilah's hospital bills, but only plans on using some of the money. The rest Leilah gets from selling her fur coats. After Evelyn withdraws the money to pay for the bill, he is mugged and beaten by a group of young men. At the last moment, they are scared away before they can find the wad of cash Evelyn has taped under his genitals. He sends Leilah red roses, then rents a bulletproof car and heads straight to the desert, leaving everything behind including Leilah. Evelyn seeks out the clean, clear desert and is captured by a woman from the subterranean female city of Beulah and dragged across the sandscape to encounter Mother, a mother goddess figure who fashioned herself with the surgeon's knife. She operates on Evelyn, removing his genitals and implants a fully functioning vagina and ovaries, as well as giving him breast augmentation surgery. She plans on impregnating him with a new Messiah, using his own sperm that she harvested from him before the operation. The transformation from male to female seems to be absolute, despite the fact that Eve struggles to learn to become the woman that her body is, and from this point on she is referred to only in female pronouns. Eve escapes but is captured, raped, and enslaved by Zero, a cruel male cult leader and \\"poet\\" with only one eye and one leg. His harem are all passive, slavish \\"wives\\" who he whips unless they talk in grunts and honour their bedfellows, the pigs. Zero leads Eve on a search for the silent film star Tristessa, an embodiment of beauty, sorrow, and loneliness, whom he hates obsessively, because he believes Tristessa has made him infertile. Tristessa was Evelyn's first object of desire in his boyhood, and Eve still has her own obsession with this figure. Zero leads his dungaree-clad harem to the glass palace of Tristessa and invades the beautiful gothic pile, discovering Tristessa herself laid out in a room surrounded by waxwork effigies in coffins. However she is alive and only when Zero tracks her down to the top of one of the towers and cuts her thong do the gang discover that Tristessa is male. Upon discovering this, Zero and his wives create a mock-up wedding ceremony and marry the two, forcing Tristessa to rape Eve. Eve and Tristessa escape, spin Zero and his harem to death in Tristessa's spinning glass palace. They escape back into the desert where they imbibe each other's newly discovered sexuality and fall in love through their realisation that they are Tiresias. Tristessa is shot by a passing band of teenage desert mafia boys. Their Colonel is 14 years old and scared of the dark. They \\"rescue\\" Eve, but she escapes and encounters Leilah in a new guise of Lilith, vagabond rebel leader. Lilith takes Eve to the coast to meet with Mother again, here they see a crazy old lady on a beach‚Äîa manifestation of ageing superficiality: dirty, caked in make-up, with piled high golden locks, singing old musical songs and living on vodka and cold tinned food and defecating in the bushes behind her deck chair. Eve realises that Leilah never objectively existed but was only a manifestation of his own lusts and corruption. Lilith tells Eve she must go and meet The Mother and pushes her into a cleft in the rocks that metamorphoses into the uterus of time. Eve progresses through the increasingly deep and warm subterranean rock pools to her rebirth. The amber Eve discovers in one of the caves and holds in her hands liquifies into ancient pine forests and primeval species. Eve is then symbolically reborn, guided by Leilah, and rejects her chauvinistic male past. Eve emerges onto a beach by Lilith, (name taken from the apocryphal story of Adam's first wife) who leaves her to go back and fight with her rebels, saying Eve cannot join her because she is pregnant. Eve swaps the gold alchemical on a neck chain that Lilith has given her for the purple skiff belonging to the crazed old woman and takes the boat and sails away.

Turner plays saxophones, flute, sings, and is a composer. While with Hawkwind, Turner was known for his experimental free jazz stylisations and outrageous stage presence, often donning full makeup and Ancient Egypt-inspired costumes. 1940‚Äì1969: Early years Turner was born in Oxford in August 1940 to a theatrical family, although his father was working in a munitions factory. At the age of 13 his family moved to the Kent seaside resort of Margate where he worked at the local funfair during the summer holiday season, befriending another seasonal worker Robert Calvert. His first influences were Rock and Roll and the films of James Dean. He went on to complete an engineering course and then undertook one voyage in the Merchant Navy. He then set about travelling around Europe picking up menial jobs, and it was during a stint as a roustabout in a travelling music circus in 1967 that he made the acquaintance of Dave Brock in Haarlem, the Netherlands. He had two years of clarinet and saxophone lessons in the early 1960s but never considered himself good enough to pursue them seriously. However, whilst travelling around Europe he encountered some free jazz players in Berlin who impressed upon him the importance of expression over technical proficiency, and it was then that he decided that what he \\"wanted to do was play free jazz in a rock band\\". 1969‚Äì1976 and 1982‚Äì84: Hawkwind Turner, owning a van, had originally offered his services as a roadie to the newly formed Hawkwind. However, when the band discovered his passion for the saxophone he was offered a position in the band to add to the overall weirdness of their sound. Nik Turner (1974) Of his playing, Turner admitted that \\"it's the overall feel rather than the individual parts of the music that we're interested in. I don't have any illusions about my technical ability. I tend to use it as an electronic medium rather than an instrument\\". He became an active and vocal member of the band, pulling in friends such as Dik Mik, Calvert and Barney Bubbles, and involving the band in community and charity projects, sometimes to the chagrin of the others. NME ‚Äì September 1972 He was a member of the band during their most commercially successful and critically acclaimed period, writing or co-writing some of their most popular songs such as \\"Brainstorm\\" and \\"Master of the Universe\\". However, complaints about his playing over other members of the band despite numerous requests to modify his behaviour eventually led to his dismissal in November 1976.Saga of Hawkwind, Carol Clerk, Publisher: Music Sales Limited, In 1982 during the recording of Choose Your Masques, Brock invited Turner to the recording sessions and he was asked to front the band for the album's tour. Turner's second stint in the band lasted just over 2 years and although some live albums and videos were released, the band did not undertake any studio recording. At the end of 1984 while preparing material for The Chronicle of the Black Sword album, he was sacked once again. 1977‚Äì1986: Sphynx and Inner City Unit After leaving Hawkwind the first time, Turner holidayed in Egypt and while visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza he was given three hours inside the King's Chamber to record some flute music. On returning to England, Steve Hillage cleaned up the tapes and assembled the Sphynx band featuring Hawkwind's Alan Powell, Gong's Mike Howlett and Tim Blake, and Harry Williamson to record music augmenting the original flute tracks while Turner adapted lyrics from the Egyptian Book of the Dead. The album was released as Xitintoday on Charisma records in 1978 and the band toured, played festivals including Deeply Vale Festivals (later released as a CD), Glastonbury Festival (part of which was broadcast BBC television) and his own themed Bohemian Love-In all day festival at the Roundhouse. Nik Turner (2010) With Williamson he conceived the \\"Nuclear Waste\\" single featuring many of the Sphynx musicians and a lead vocal by Sting. He then guested on the album Fairy Tales by Williamson and Gilli Smyth's project Mother Gong, and out of this he, Mo Vicarage and Ermanno Ghisio-Erba (a.k.a. Dino Ferari) formed Inner City Unit (ICU) with Trev Thoms and Dead Fred. Thoms and Ghisio-Erba had previously played together in Steve Took's Horns who had played their only gig at the Bohemian Love-In. The Horns were managed by Tony Landau, a friend of Turner's since adolescence, and were fronted by former Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist Steve Peregrin Took, who would later make guest lead vocal appearances with ICU alongside his former Horns bandmates.Liner notes to Blow It ‚Äì The All New Adventures of Steve Took's Horns, Cherry Red CDM RED 255, 2004 Inner City Unit recorded the albums Pass Out and Maximum Effect before collapsing due to certain members drug problems. Turner and Dead Fred had stints in Hawkwind before regrouping to release the albums New Anatomy, The President Tapes and the EP Blood and Bone. 1987‚Äì1999 Turner's next project was Nik Turner's Fantastic All Stars, a sax and Hammond organ driven jazz and rhythm and blues band. They gigged for several years, eventually releasing the album Kubanno Kickasso!. Turner and Twink got together for some impromptu live performances under the name Pinkwind, two CDs of which were released on Twink's own record label without the permission of Turner. In 1993 Turner was approached by Pressurehed and Helios Creed to record another version of his Sphynx project using the original flute tracks, resulting in the album Sphynx. This partnership then developed further, regularly touring in the US performing a set of Hawkwind-centred material sometimes featuring Genesis P-Orridge, Jello Biafra and former Hawkwind members Simon House, Del Dettmar and Powell. One studio album Prophets of Time was released in 1994 followed by the live CD and DVD Space Ritual 1994 Live and another live CD Past or Future? in 1996. Out of this set of musicians formed the band Anubian Lights, centred on Len Del Rio and Tommy Gre√±as from Pressurehed with contributions from Turner, Dettmar and House, as did the band Spiral Realms centred on House and Rio. 2000‚Äìpresent On 21 October 2000 at the Brixton Academy a 'Hawkestra' event took place, featuring nearly all past members of Hawkwind. Disagreements between various participants led to any restaging of the event being unlikely, but Turner did stage a further event under the banner 'The Greasy Truckers Party featuring members of the Hawkestra' on 21 October 2001 at the London Astoria. Out of this a loose band formed, performing further gigs and eventually using the name xhawkwind.com. An appearance at Guilfest in 2002 led to confusion as to whether this actually was Hawkwind, sufficiently irking Brock into taking legal action to prohibit Turner from trading under the name Hawkwind, a case which Turner lost. The band settled on the name Space Ritual and are still currently active. Nik also made an impromptu appearance during the first Reggae Festival of Wales in 2003, joining the Goldmaster Allstars and Jamaican vocalist Alton Ellis. Turner has resurrected another version of Inner City Unit with Thoms, performing irregular gigs. He also fronts the \\"psychedelic latino-funk\\" band Galaktikos. He continues to attend festivals playing and guesting whenever possible and is an eager contributor to other band's projects, such as recording an album and touring with US space rockers Spaceseed in 2004, and live appearances with UK dance outfit Akahum at BGG Shareholders Party & HEADS Haiti Benefit show. Living in Carmarthen, he often busks playing his saxophone in Cardiff city centre during weekend nights. Nik Turner (2011) After playing at \\"Hawkfan Festival\\" in Hamburg in 1997 and the Space And Rock Festival ‚Äì Rocksjon, Jonkoping, Sweden in 1998 with the Finnish space rock group Dark Sun, they moved to play at Tavastia Club, Helsinki, Finland. This resulted in the live album, Ice Ritual, which was released in 2000. In 2008 Nik Turner was invited to Space Mirrors collective as a guest member. Since that time he recorded flute and sax on three Space Mirrors releases: \\"Majestic-12: A Hidden Presence\\" (2009), \\"Dreams of Area 51\\" (2011) and \\"In Darkness They Whisper\\" (2012). Turner also provided flute for Dodson and Fogg, a folk rock project released in 2012, after a chance meeting with Mr H a Welsh Jazz/Blues singer songwriter at Brecon Jazz festival 2012 where Turner and Mr H performed a free improvised Jazz session and Mr H invited Turner to feature on his 4th album Poets Balladeers and Cheats. In October 2012 Turner entered Berryhill studios in Monmouthshire and Performed an improvised alto sax session on seven of Mr H's compositions which was released in the spring of 2013. In March 2013 Nik turned up at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas playing an official SXSW gig at Rebels Honky Tonk bar billed as Nik Turner (ex Hawkwind) playing predominantly Space Ritual songs. He also guested on stage with The Soft Moon at Hotel Vegas the previous night. Nik also played Sax and narrated Brainstorm on the brand new Warfare album (2017 High Roller Records) At the Laugharne Weekend 2019, Damo Suzuki played the Fountain Inn with his all-star Sound Carriers which included Euros Childs and New Order drummer Stephen Morris. Nik Turner joined them at the end of their set. Discography :For Turner's work as a member of Inner City Unit, see the Inner City Unit article.

As with some other ISIHAC games, such as Celebrity What's My Line?, the game has been created by taking an existing one and removing the central concept. As the late chairman Humphrey Lyttelton put it: \\"In the original, the players were not allowed to speak, resulting in much hilarity. Our version differs subtly in two ways.\\" The format of the game is largely similar to the original. One team is given the name of a book, film, television or radio series. They announce the number of words and the format, and act out a short improvised play, conveying the title, usually by means of a rather forced pun. For instance, the clue for the BBC 2 science documentary series Q.E.D. was: : \\"I want some scratchcards.\\" : \\"Well, Edie, you just join that line of people.\\" : \\"I want some scratchcards.\\" : \\"Just stand behind that man there, Edie.\\" : \\"How can I get my scratchcards?\\" : \\"Edie, how else can I put this?\\" : [\\"Queue, Edie\\"] Occasionally, truly masterful clues are given: for example the film Dirty Harry was clued with the single line \\"Potter! ... Don't do that.\\", delivered in an impression of Alan Rickman's portrayal of Severus Snape. Another memorable clue was for the film Monsters, Inc., in which Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden are about to do the washing up, at which point Barry cries \\"Good lord! You don't wash the dishes in this, do you? It's enormous!\\" [\\"Monster Sink\\"] As the above shows, the sketches would often belabour the point somewhat. This was particularly true in later years when Graeme Garden and Barry Cryer invented the characters of Hamish and Dougal, two rural Scotsmen who featured regularly in the sketches, and later were given their own series, You'll Have Had Your Tea. Another tradition in the later years was that Humph's initial explanation of the game would mention the television version of charades, Give Us a Clue. This would inevitably involve a double entendre about either Una Stubbs, or more often, Lionel Blair for example: : The master of the genre was undoubtedly Lionel Blair, and who will ever forget him, exhausted and on his knees, finishing off An Officer and a Gentleman in under two minutes? : We particularly recall one very early show when Una Stubbs scored maximum points after the teams took only a few seconds to recognise her Fanny by Gaslight. A particularly memorable example occurred in the programme broadcast from the Alhambra Theatre, Bradford, on 27 May 2002. On this occasion, the guest panellist was Sandi Toksvig. Humph concluded his introduction to the round as follows: :\\"...miming the titles...against a strict time limit. The most highly skilled of all was Lionel Blair ‚Äî but how the tears of frustration welled up in his eyes during their Italian tour at not being allowed the use of his mouth to finish off Two Gentlemen of Verona!\\". This caused Toksvig to corpse, and the game was held up for almost a minute while peals of laughter echoed from the audience in response to Sandi's hysterical laughing that had rendered her completely helpless. This is possibly the only time that Radio 4 has broadcast a minute of uninterrupted laughter. Just before the \\"mystery voice\\" tells the listeners the title of the subject, Humph usually announces that the team to perform it and the audience are being shown it on the \\"laser display screen\\" (sometimes described in more elaborate terms). This is, in fact, the programme's producer running on to the stage holding a large card with the title written on it ‚Äî a joke only for the benefit of the studio audience (and to make listeners wonder why they laugh a moment after the words \\"laser display screen\\"). Occasionally, particularly if the apparatus has been described with more ridiculous lavishness (with terms such as \\"multiplex\\", \\"digitally enhanced\\", etc.), Humph has added another joke based on its actually being a big card by saying it has been \\"so generously funded by our hosts\\". In keeping with the nature of the show, sometimes the team giving the definition purposely make it so obvious that the opposing team pretends not to know what the title is, and has to be given numerous hints, for comic effect.

The band's name is Latin for pit or abyss. The first letters of their eight full-length albums spell \\"HEIL SOVA\\" - referring to the band's frontman, Demonos Sova, who is the only original member of the band. Their music is stylistically similar to early black metal acts such as Venom and Celtic Frost. Their lyrics deal with occult and religious themes. History Barathrum was founded at Kuopio, Finland under a name of Darkfeast, which was changed into Barathrum the year after. Barathrum recorded several demos during the years 1991-1993. After the demos, Barathrum signed to an underground German record label called Nazgul‚Äôs Eyrie Productions which released low budget studio albums \\"Hailstorm\\" (1995), \\"Eerie (1995)\\" and \\"Infernal\\" (1997) before the label went hiatus and left Barathrum as an unsigned artist. The band signed to Spinefarm Records record label in 1998 and released five albums, ‚ÄùLegions Of Perkele‚Äù (1998), \\"Saatana\\" (1999), ‚ÄùOkkult\\" (2000), \\"Venomous\\" (2002) and ‚ÄùAnno Aspera: 2003 Years After Bastard‚Äôs Birth‚Äù making Barathrum one of the most prominent bands in Finnish black metal scene. After the years of hiatus, the band was signed to Finnish underground record label Saturnal Records and released their ninth full-length album \\"Fanatiko (2017)\\" in April 28th 2017.

Wickson, The Community of the Realm in Thirteenth Century England (London 1970) p. 50 Setting When in the spring of 1258 Henry III sought financial aid from Parliament, he was confronted by a group of barons who insisted on a new commission of reform, in the shape of a council of twenty-four members, twelve selected by the crown, twelve by the barons.J. R. Tanner, ed., The Cambridge Medieval History (Cambridge 1929) p. 277 The Provisions of Oxford were the reform programme the twenty-four, including Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, set out. Provisions The Provisions set up a new form of government, with a 15-member Privy Council (nine baronial) to advise the king and oversee the entire administration as a standing body. They also confirmed that \\"there be three parliaments a year...to treat of the common wants of the kingdom, and of the king.\\"Provisions, quoted in R. Wickson, The Community of the Realm in Thirteenth Century England (London 1970) p. 107-9 At the parliaments, the Fifteen would be checked and monitored by another body of twelve representative barons. Meanwhile the men selected (by four electors appointed by the Twenty-four) were to supervise ministerial appointments, local administration and the custody of royal castles; while recommendations for an inquest into local (mis-)government, and further measures of reform were also set out. =Linguistic innovation= A written confirmation of the agreement was sent to the sheriffs of all the counties of England trilingually,R. Berkhofer, The Experience of Power in Medieval Europe (2017) in Latin, French and, significantly, in Middle English. The use of the English language was symbolic of the Anglicisation of the government of England and an antidote to the Francization which had taken place in the decades immediately before. The Provisions were the first government documents to be published in English since the Norman Conquest two hundred years before.English and its Historical Development, Part 20 (English was re-established in Britain) Later developments The Provisions of Oxford were confirmed and extended in 1259 by the Provisions of Westminster.S. H. Steinberg, A New Dictionary of British History (London 1963) p.280 The administrative controls of the Provisions of Oxford were overthrown by Henry, helped by a papal bull, in 1261, seeding the start of the Second Barons' War (1263‚Äì1267), which was won by the King and his royalist supporters; and they were annulled for the last time in 1266 by the Dictum of Kenilworth. However the administrative and legislative reforms the barons had initiated were taken up and confirmed in the Statute of Marlborough. The 1258 Provisions had a significant effect upon the development of the English Common Law, limiting in part the expansion of royal jurisdiction by way of the number of available writs, but in the main confirming the importance of the common law of the land for all, from king to commoner.

It is marked as Alaska Route 4 from Valdez to Delta Junction and as Alaska Route 2 from there to Fairbanks. It also connects segments of Alaska Route 1 between the Glenn Highway and the Tok Cut-Off. The Richardson Highway was the first major road built in Alaska.  History  The \\"first car\\" to travel from Valdez to Eagle, 1913 A pack trail from the port at Valdez to Eagle, a distance of about 409 miles (660 km), was built in 1898 by the U.S. Army to provide an \\"all- American\\" route to the Klondike gold fields. After the rush ended, the Army kept the trail open in order to connect its posts at Fort Liscum, in Valdez, and Fort Egbert, in Eagle. The Fairbanks gold rush in 1902, and the construction of a WAMCATS telegraph line along the trail in 1903, made the Valdez-to-Eagle trail one of the most important access routes to the Alaska Interior, so in 1910, the Alaska Road Commission upgraded it to a wagon road. The head of the project was U.S. Army General Wilds P. Richardson, for whom the highway was later named. During the construction, the government hired failed gold prospectors as well as regular construction workers. The income from this work allowed many of the prospectors to leave Alaska. Several roadhouses now on the National Register of Historic Places were constructed along the route at this time. The rise of motorized travel led the road to be upgraded to automobile standards in the 1920s. To finance continued maintenance and road construction, the Alaska Road Commission instituted tolls for commercial vehicles in 1933 of up to $175 per trip, which were collected at the Tanana River ferry crossing at Big Delta. When the tolls were further increased in 1941 to boost business for the Alaska Railroad, disgruntled truckers nicknamed \\"gypsies\\" started a rogue ferry service in order to evade the toll. The Alaska and Glenn highways, built during World War II, connected the rest of the continent and Anchorage to the Richardson Highway at Delta Junction and Glennallen respectively, allowing motor access to the new military bases built in the Territory just prior to the war: Fort Richardson in Anchorage, and Fort Wainwright adjacent to Fairbanks. The bridge at Big Delta, the last remaining gap, was built as part of the Alaska Highway project. The southern end was only open during summers until 1950, when a freight company foreman who lived near the treacherous Thompson Pass plowed the snow himself for an entire season to prove the route could be used year- round. The highway was paved in 1957. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, built in 1973-1977, mostly parallels the highway from Fairbanks to Valdez. Recent and future improvements North Pole area. The interchange was constructed in the early 2000s, after an approximately three-decade history of serious accidents at the previous at-grade intersection. Canyon crossing (Richardson Highway) * During the 1990s, the highway was upgraded from Fairbanks to the main gate at Eielson AFB, making this stretch a 4-lane divided road. Intersections with other roads, however, are still almost entirely at-grade. * Under SAFETEA-LU, Alaska Route 2 from the Canadian border to Fairbanks, comprising parts of the Richardson and Alaska Highways, has been declared a High Priority Corridor (Corridor 67). What this means for the distant future is not yet certain; although SAFETEA-LU does explicitly provide federal funds for upgrading the road to 4 lanes and divided, from Salcha to Delta Junction.

Purpose The Workforce Investment Act is a federal act that \\"provides workforce investment activities, through statewide and local workforce investment systems, that increase the employment, retention, and earnings of participants, and increase occupational skill attainment by participants, and, as a result, improve the quality of the workforce, reduce welfare dependency, and enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the Nation.\\"\\"Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\\" Department of Labor. August 7, 1998. http://www.doleta.gov/usworkforce/wia/wialaw.pdf. The law was enacted to replace the Job Training Partnership Act and certain other Federal (outlined below in History) and job training laws with new workforce investment systems (or workforce development). The law was enacted during Bill Clinton's second term and attempts to induce business to participate in the local delivery of Workforce Development Services through Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs) which were to be chaired by private sector members of the local community. A majority of Board members were also required to represent business interests. History =Job Training and Partnership Act of 1982= The federal Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 was the predecessor of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998. This law used federal funding to implement programs that prepared youth and unskilled adults for entry into the workforce and provided employment-related services for disadvantaged individuals. For each succeeding fiscal year, programs such as adult and youth programs, federally administered programs, summer youth employment training programs and training assistance for dislocated workers were carried out. =Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973= The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act of 1973 consolidated all existing federal job-training programs. This act offered work to low-income individuals, long-term unemployed individuals, and out-of-high school individuals. Training and full-time jobs in the public service were provided for unemployed, underemployed, and disadvantaged individuals. In order to decentralize control of federally controlled job training programs, the Act provided funds to state and local governments through federal grants. =Rehabilitation Act of 1973= Rehabilitation Act of 1973 authorized: (a) the formula grant programs of vocational rehabilitation, supporting employment, independent living, and client assistance; (b) a variety of training and service-discretionary grants administered by the Rehabilitation Administration; and (c) research activities that were administered by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research. Also, this Act prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability and expanded special Federal responsibilities and training programs within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. =Manpower Development Training Act of 1962= The Manpower Development Training Act of 1962 originated when President John F. Kennedy told legislators that \\"Large scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough, but large scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable.\\" This act dealt with this situation by promoting a professional training plan and providing major Federal Funding to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in order to improve the technical training of the unemployed and underemployed labor in the postwar period. The professional training plan provided federal funding to retain workers displaced because of technological change and for classroom and on-the-job-training targeted to low-income individuals and welfare recipients. =Wagner Peyser Act of 1933= The Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933 established a nationwide employment system of public employment offices. These offices were known as the employment service and were created for cooperation of the States in the promotion of system to aid employment. Mission and Goals The main goal of the WIA is to create a system that provides a means to increase employment, retention, and earnings of individuals. Accomplishing this goal is dependent on the services the WIA provides to increase occupational skill attainment by participants. The WIA is split into five titles that outline how the WIA accomplishes this goal. =Title One= Title one of the Act authorizes state workforce investment boards, as well as local workforce investment boards. In order to measure how well people are doing in the program, title one requires the use of certain standards for success. Title one also authorizes a one-stop delivery system to be used in the program. This system sets up one place participants can go in their local area to get both job training and referrals. National programs such as jobs corps, Native American, migrant, and veterans programs are also authorized in title one. =Title Two= Title two sets up systems to help adults reach certain literacy levels in order to be successful in the workforce. Adult education is provided to help adults reach a minimum of an 8th grade reading level before entering the workforce. =Title Three= Grants and contracts are authorized in title three to provide and conduct the following training, projects, and services. Grants provide academic training to individuals that provide rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities. Training to maintain and upgrade basic skills and knowledge of the people providing service delivery and rehabilitation technology services is provided under title three. Grants and contracts are also authorized to conduct special projects and demonstrations that include research and evaluation that expand rehabilitation services. Additionally, vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities who are migrant or seasonal farmworkers is provided. Grants are also used to initiate recreational programs for individuals with disabilities to aid them in employment, mobility, socialization, independence, and community integration. Lastly, grants and contracts are authorized to provide training and information to individuals with disabilities and their representatives. This training should develop skills necessary for individuals with disabilities to gain access to rehabilitation systems and statewide workforce investment systems and become active decision makers in the rehabilitation process. =Title Four= Title four amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in order to work with the WIA to accomplish the goal of helping people return to the workforce. Title four creates a national council on disability, which is appointed by the president, to link rehabilitation programs to state and local workforce development systems. Members of this council are individuals with disabilities, parents or guardians of individuals with disabilities, or other individuals who have substantial knowledge or experience relating to disability policy or programs. The function of this council is to guarantee that people with disabilities have access to local and state workforce development systems in order to provide equal opportunity. =Title Five= Title five provides general provisions by which the WIA can accomplish its goals. Title five states that the WIA is a state unified plan. Incentive grants will be rewarded to states exceeding negotiated performance levels and defined indicators of performance. Provisions The provisions of the Act were delineated into five subchapters: =Workforce Investment Definitions= Sets forth definitions for workforce investment programs as cited by the chapter and for future legislation using this Act as basis for funding. =Statewide and Local Workforce Investment Systems= :*Directs state governors to establish and appoint the members of a statewide partnership to assist in the development of the state plan. :*Directs state governors to designate local workforce investment areas in accordance with specified requirements. :*Requires that local workforce investment boards, and youth councils within such boards, be established in each local area of a state. =Job Corps= :*Revises provisions for the Job Corps (formerly under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), which this title repeals and replaces.) :*Provides for Job Corps recruitment standards, graduate readjustment allowances through local one-stop customer service centers, industry councils and management information. :*Revises Job Corps requirements for: :**Individual eligibility :**Screening, selection, assignment, and enrollment :**Job Corps Centers :**Program activities and continued services :**Counseling and job placement :**Support :**Operating plan :**Standards of conduct :**Community participation :**Advisory committees :**Experimental, research, and demonstration projects. =National Programs= :*Provides for workforce investment activities and supplemental services under programs for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, migrant and seasonal farmworkers and veterans (replacing similar programs formerly under JTPA.) :*Directs the Secretary of Labor to make youth opportunity grants to eligible local partnerships to provide specified activities to increase the long-term employment of eligible youth who live in empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and high poverty areas. :*Directs the Secretary to provide assistance to an entity to establish a role model academy for out-of-school youth in a residential center located on the site of a closed or realigned military installation. :*Directs the Secretary of Labor to provide technical assistance to states to help with transitions, general performance improvement, and dislocated worker training improvement. :*Directs the Secretary to publish a biennial plan for demonstration, pilot, multiservice, research, and multistate projects. Sets forth requirements for such projects under such plan, including competitive award procedures and peer review. :*Directs the Secretary to provide for continuing evaluation of programs and activities under this title. Authorizes the Secretary to conduct evaluations of other federally funded employment-related programs and activities. :*Authorizes the Secretary to make national emergency grants for: :**Employment and training assistance to workers affected by major economic dislocations :**Disaster relief employment :**Additional assistance for dislocated workers =Administration= :*Sets forth requirements for: :**Labor standards, prohibitions on worker displacement, and other requirements relating to use of funds :**Prompt allocation of funds :**Monitoring :**Fiscal controls and sanctions :**Reports, recordkeeping, and investigations :**Administrative adjudication :**Judicial review :**Nondiscrimination :**State legislative authority :**Workforce flexibility partnership plans :**Use of certain real property :**Continuation of State activities and policies. :*Declares that a state shall not be prohibited by the federal government from drug use testing of participants in certain workforce investment programs and sanctioning those who test positive. Funding and Budget Each state receives a different amount from the federal government for their budget under the Workforce Investment Act. The amount in the budget is dependent on the size of population for each State. Utah gets $1.5 million each year from the federal government. Due to the fact that Utah has a relatively small population, compared to other states, the budget stays with the state instead of being distributed to local areas. In larger states, such as California, the budget is much larger and is divided out to local boards. The budget, regardless of the state, can be used for the following three main \\"streams:\\" \\"Summary of Workforce Development Provisions of.\\" The Workforce Invest ment Act Of 1998, Employment & Training Administration (ETA). January 7, 2010. http://www.doleta.gov/usworkforce/wia/summarywia.cfm. =Adults= The Secretary of Labor reserves Twenty percent of funds for National Emergency Grants, dislocated worker demonstration efforts, and technical assistance. =Dislocated Workers= The remaining 60 are allocated to local areas, while 15 percent being reserved for statewide activities, and 25 percent for State rapid response efforts. =Youth= Eighty Five percent of youth funds are allocated to local areas. Fifteen percent are reserved for statewide activities, and funds appropriated in excess of $1 billion (up to $250 million) will be used by the U.S. Department of Labor to fund Youth Opportunity grants. States can merge the fifteen percent set-asides for statewide activities from the three separate funding streams if they choose to do so (for example, state set-aside funds from the adult stream may be used for statewide youth activities.) Also, with the approval of the Governor, local areas may transfer 20 percent between adult and dislocated workers funding streams.Stewart, R. (2014, October 24). Workforce Education & Training Program Manager. (L. Palmer, Interviewer) Subsequent actions The law was slightly amended by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Amendments of 1998 and the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (H.R. 803; 113th Congress) was enacted on July 22, 2014 . It seeks to consolidate job training programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) and will streamline the process of receiving services from three levels (core, intensive, and training) into a single process, allowing clients to receive needed services earlier in the process. In addition, it will push those providing WIA services to collaborate more with the Vocational Rehabilitation programs in order to provide more services for people with disabilities into a single funding stream. It also amended the Wagner-Peyser Act, reauthorized adult-education programs, and reauthorized programs under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The various job programs are authorized for six years with a requirement that they record and report on how many people get new jobs through their participation in the programs. The new regulations are currently in draft form and will not be finalized till January 2016.\\"Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.\\" Of 2014, Employment & Training Administration (ETA).

History Thoms and Ferari were both key members of Steve Peregrin Took's band Steve Took's Horns. Following the Horns' breakup in mid 1978, Turner recruited Ferari to drum on his Sphynx project before adding Thoms the following year to his new band Inner City Unit. Took continued to work with his former band members by guesting with ICU at assorted gigs during 1979-1980, particularly at free concerts at Notting Hill Gate's Meanwhile Gardens. This original line-up produced two albums, Passout and The Maximum Effect. A compilation of out-takes and demos Punkadelic was released during the same period. In 1982 Turner returned to Hawkwind taking Dead Fred with him, thus ending the first incarnation of ICU. In 1984, Nik Turner and Dead Fred were removed from Hawkwind and decided to reform ICU. Judge Trev and Stupp were unavailable for the making of the next album New Anatomy so they recruited Steve Pond, who had previously toured with ICU during the shows for the Passout album as synth player, to play guitar and program the drum machine. Mick Stupp rejoined the band in time for the New Anatomy live shows and was joined by another ex-Hawkwind man Dave Anderson on bass. The second incarnation of ICU released an EP, Blood and Bone, and a second album, The President's Tapes, before finally falling out on the winter solstice of 1985 and calling it a day. In the 1990s, Judge Trev used the ICU name for his own band with original drummer Dino Ferari, releasing one album Now You Know the Score as Judge Trev's Inner City Unit. In 2001, a version of ICU combining members from the first two incarnations played two shows. A fourth version of the band played the closing party of the 2006 FennerFest in Slough. Other activities Turner started his rhythm and blues and jazz rock outfit Nik Turner's Fantastic Allstars in the late 1980s. They eventually released an album Kubanno Kickasso! in 2001. Dead Fred and Steve Pond went on to play with another ex-Hawkwind man Robert Calvert. Mick Stupp played with many different bands with varying styles, moving from drums to guitar over time. The Imperial Pompadours were an ICU side project with sleeve designer Barney Bubbles. Bubbles also produced the band's first three album covers. In the 1980s, original guitarist Judge Trev Thoms started a three-piece metal band named Atomgods which, for a while, also featured second ICU guitarist Steve Pond on bass. Judge Trev Thoms died of pancreatic cancer on 8 December 2010. Steve Pond, Dead Fred and Mick Stupp still play together in a band called Krankschaft, sometimes joined by Turner and Dave Anderson and Dino Ferari to perform Inner City Unit songs as a tribute to Judge Trev Thoms.

The mountain was named in 1901 by its first climber, the English explorer Edward Whymper, after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, the sixth Governor-General of Canada. There are sources that date the naming in 1912 after Stanley H. Mitchell, Secretary-Treasurer of Alpine Club of Canada. The peak is visible from the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 93. Stanley Glacier on the northeast face of the peak can be seen up close by following a hiking trail into a hanging valley between the peak and a southern outlier of Storm Mountain. Stanley Peak can be ascended from a scrambling route by late summer but involves much routefinding among the many ledges and gullies on the north face. Climbing routes (UIAA III) travel the north and northeast faces.  Other BC peaks  There are another two peaks in British Columbia called Stanley Peak. One is 2,935 m high, located at the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District (), 24 km north-west from Keyhole Falls and 62 km west from Gold Bridge. The other is 2,030 m high, in the Stikine Region () (90 km north-west from Skagway, Alaska United States).

The band gained national success when their demo album, Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz, entered the Finnish charts. The band was infamous for their apparent hatred of the Norwegian black metal scene back the early 1990s; however, the band now seems to have disassociated themselves from that dislike. Luttinen later affirmed that \\"We have absolutely nothing against Norwegians. I even made up with Euronymous before he was killed so just forget this thing, it is ancient history\\". Impaled Nazarene stopped wearing corpse paint in the mid-1990s when black metal exploded, with Luttinen explaining that \\"we felt it was time distance ourselves a bit from the ridiculous ideas and statements that were circulating around the whole scene back then. And look around, we are not alone who have done this. Even Norwegian bands have dropped paint and other shit and are concentrating on the music instead of childish statements\\". With the release of Suomi Finland Perkele, Impaled Nazarene dropped some of their aggression and made a stylistic shift, but this direction ended with the removal of Kimmo Luttinen from the line-up. Mika Luttinen explained his dissatisfaction with Kimmo and how the band changed under his guidance: After growing increasingly unpolished in delivery, the band made a shift, beginning with Nihil (2000) and the accession of Children of Bodom guitarist Alexi Laiho, towards a sound that has been described as \\"a benzedrine-fueled combination of thrash metal and Iron Maiden\\".Schwarz, Paul (14 January 2002). \\"Nazarenes Aren't the Only Fiends: CoC chats with Mika Luttinen from Impaled Nazarene\\". Chronicles of Chaos. Retrieved 9 February 2014. Luttinen explained that Laiho's role was critical: \\"it was clear that now that we had finally two guitar players that we kind of like wanted to get away from that punky kind of writing style and started just wanting to get more back to the metal feeling\\". Their ninth studio album, Pro Patria Finlandia, was a popular import album for Japan. Impaled Nazarene have toured with bands including Cannibal Corpse, Mayhem and Dark Tranquility, traversing four continents and over thirty countries. On 16 March 2003, guitarist Teemu Raimoranta died falling off a bridge onto the ice below, in what was described as \\"an alcohol-related accidental fall\\".  Lyrical content  For most of their history, Impaled Nazarene has focused on Finnish nationalism (for instance in their song \\"Total War - Winter War\\" about the Soviet-Finnish war in 1939 and 1940), and have demonstrated a strong anti-communist bent, as exemplified in their song \\"Healers of the Red Plague\\" on Rapture. Other lyrics revolve around war and Satanism. When asked about the hints of humour previously manifest in the lyrics, Luttinen affirmed that this was limited to Suomi Finland Perkele: \\"There will be no humour, we are not some fucking joke. If people find my lyrics funny, then, well, something is most certainly wrong in their heads\\".Zamora, Bruno. \\"Impaled Nazarene\\" Tartarean Desire. Retrieved 9 February 2014. The band has also maintained a tradition of including at least one song on every album which has the word \\"goat\\" in the title, which Luttinen considers a \\"trademark\\" of the band: Impaled Nazarene's Nihil (2000) is the only album that has been subject to a ban. However, this has caused additional problems for the band as, according to Luttinen, \\"Somebody seem to have really something against us and unfortunately that somebody has power enough to get our shows cancelled\\".Kwakkel, Mart (4 December 2007). \\"Interview with Impaled Nazarene\\". Rockezine. Retrieved 9 February 2014. Luttinen has been critical of the performance bans that the band has suffered in Germany and Poland, which he made explicit in the lyrics for Manifest (2007). In response to a question about the lack of sexual themes on Manifest, Luttinen responded: In June 2017 the hardcore festival Ieperfest in Ieper, Belgium, removed Impaled Nazarene from the line up after threats of violence from protesters. The reason for the protest was the band's lyrics condoning homophobia and rape. The festival organizers issued the following statement: Members ;Current line-up * Mika Luttinen - vocals (1990‚Äìpresent) * Reima Kellokoski - drums (1995‚Äìpresent) * Mikael Arnkil - bass (2000‚Äìpresent) * Tomi \\"UG\\" Ullgr√©n - guitar (2007‚Äìpresent) ;Former members * Kimmo \\"Sir\\" Luttinen ‚Äì drums (1990‚Äì1995), guitar (1992‚Äì1995) * Antti Pihkala - bass (1990‚Äì1991) * Ari Holappa ‚Äì guitar (1990‚Äì1992) * Mika P√§√§kk√∂ ‚Äì guitar (1990‚Äì1992) * Harri Halonen ‚Äì bass (1991‚Äì1992) * Jarno Anttila ‚Äì guitar (1992‚Äì2010) * Taneli Jarva ‚Äì bass (1992‚Äì1996) * Jani Lehtosaari ‚Äì bass (1996‚Äì2000) * Alexi Laiho ‚Äì guitar (1998‚Äì2000) * Teemu Raimoranta ‚Äì guitar (2000‚Äì2003; his death) * Tuomo \\"Tuomio\\" Louhio ‚Äì guitar (2003‚Äì2007) =Timeline= ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:16 PlotArea = left:120 bottom:150 top:10 right:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:11/01/1990 till:01/01/2020 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:2 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1991 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1992 Colors= id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitars id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums,_percussion id:studio value:black legend:Studio_releases id:other value:gray(0.5) legend:Others_releases LineData= at:02/01/1991 color:other layer:back at:08/01/1991 color:other layer:back at:02/01/1992 color:other layer:back at:11/01/1992 color:black layer:back at:06/01/1993 color:black layer:back at:11/16/1994 color:black layer:back at:04/29/1996 color:black layer:back at:05/05/1998 color:black layer:back at:06/16/2000 color:black layer:back at:09/18/2001 color:black layer:back at:11/03/2003 color:black layer:back at:03/22/2006 color:black layer:back at:11/24/2007 color:black layer:back at:11/19/2010 color:other layer:back at:11/20/2010 color:black layer:back at:12/12/2013 color:other layer:back at:04/14/2014 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:Mika text:\\"Mika Luttinen\\" bar:Mika2 text:\\"Mika P√§√§kk√∂\\" bar:Ari text:\\"Ari Holappa\\" bar:Jarno text:\\"Jarno Anttila\\" bar:Alexi text:\\"Alexi Laiho\\" bar:Teemu text:\\"Teemu Raimoranta\\" bar:Tuomo text:\\"Tuomo Louhio\\" bar:Tomi text:\\"Tomi Ullgren\\" bar:Antti text:\\"Antti Pihkala\\" bar:Harri text:\\"Harri Halonen\\" bar:Taneli text:\\"Taneli Jarva\\" bar:Jani text:\\"Jani Lehtosaari\\" bar:Mikael text:\\"Mikael Arnkil\\" bar:Kimmo text:\\"Kimmo Luttinen\\" bar:Reima text:\\"Reima Kellokoski\\" PlotData = width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4) bar:Mika from:11/01/1990 till:end color:vocals bar:Ari from:11/01/1990 till:06/01/1992 color:guitar bar:Jarno from:06/01/1992 till:07/01/2010 color:guitar bar:Mika2 from:11/01/1990 till:06/01/1992 color:guitar bar:Alexi from:09/01/1998 till:10/01/2000 color:guitar bar:Teemu from:10/01/2000 till:03/16/2003 color:guitar bar:Tuomo from:03/16/2003 till:05/01/2007 color:guitar bar:Tomi from:05/01/2007 till:end color:guitar bar:Antti from:11/01/1990 till:05/01/1991 color:bass bar:Harri from:05/01/1991 till:06/01/1992 color:bass bar:Taneli from:06/01/1992 till:09/01/1996 color:bass bar:Jani from:09/01/1996 till:10/01/2000 color:bass bar:Mikael from:10/01/2000 till:end color:bass bar:Kimmo from:11/01/1990 till:06/01/1995 color:drums bar:Kimmo from:06/01/1992 till:06/01/1995 color:guitar width:3 bar:Reima from:06/01/1995 till:end color:drums Discography =Albums= ;Studio albums * Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz (1992) * Ugra-Karma (1993) * Suomi Finland Perkele (1994) * Latex Cult (1996) * Rapture (1998) * Nihil (2000) * Absence of War Does Not Mean Peace (2001) * All That You Fear (2003) * Pro Patria Finlandia (2006) * Manifest (2007) * Road to the Octagon (2010) * Vigorous and Liberating Death (2014) ;Live albums * Death Comes In 26 Carefully Selected Pieces (2005) ;Compilation albums * Decade of Decadence (2000) ;Split albums * Impaled Nazarene/Driller Killer (2000) =EPs= * Goat Perversion (1991) * Enlightenment Process (2010) * Die In Holland (2013) * Morbid Fate (2017) =Demos= * Shemhamforash (1991) * Taog Eht Fo Htao Eht (1991) * Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz...

Competitors meet yearly at a festival following a retreat marking the initiation of young men into adulthood.Jim Hudgens, Richard Trillo, and Nathalie Calonnec (2003). The rough guide to West Africa (4th ed.). Rough Guides. .Gemma Pitcher, David Andrew, Kate Armstrong, James Bainbridge, Tim Bewer, and Jean-Bernard Carillet (2007). Africa (11th ed.). Lonely Planet. pp. 524. . Evala is the penultimate element of this initiation rite, during which young men are separated from their families for one week, residing in special huts where they are fed and subject to mental training. Prior to wrestling, participants go on a pilgrimage which involves climbing three mountains; those who do not complete it are not initiated into adulthood. Although wrestlers are initiated regardless of whether they win or not, losing is considered shameful to the family name. The last of these initiation rites is circumcision. Notable people The country's former president, Gnassingb√© Eyadema, who took power in a coup, was of Kabye ethnicity. Togo is now led by Eyadema's son, Faure Gnassingb√©.

The primary attraction of General Grant Grove is the giant sequoia trees that populate the grove. General Grant Grove's most well-known tree is the General Grant Tree, which is 267 feet tall and the third largest known tree in the world.Traditionally, the size of a sequoia has been measured by calculating the volume of the tree's trunk. Using this metric, the General Grant Tree is the second largest known tree in the world and the President tree is the third largest. However, a 2011-2012 study of the President tree found that, if the volume of a tree's branches is taken into account, the President is larger than the General Grant. The General Grant Tree is over 1,500 years old and is known as the United States's national Christmas Tree. General Grant Grove consists of 154 acres and is geographically isolated from the rest of Kings Canyon National Park. Kings Canyon National Park is in Fresno County, California The General Grant Tree 3 July 2007 History The original inhabitants of what is today General Grant Grove and Kings Canyon National Park were natives of the Shoshonean language group. The Monache, T√ºbatulabal, and Yokuts were the primary native groups of the region. In 1846, Hale Tharp, a disenchanted miner who hoped to establish a cattle ranch in the region, became the first white settler to enter the Giant Forest that would later constitute Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Tharp carved a shelter out of a fallen sequoia tree and began to raise cattle. Initially, Native Americans of the region welcomed Tharp, as he helped them hunt and coexisted peacefully among them. Tharp's settlement in the Giant Forest, however, spurred further human interest in the region, and the native population began to contract contagious diseases from incoming white settlers. Tharp claimed that the natives pleaded with him to help them prevent white settlers from entering the valley. When Tharp told them this was impossible, the natives elected to leave the valley. By 1865, within twenty years of Tharp's arrival in the Giant Forest, the natives of the region had moved elsewhere and the Giant Forest was open to timber companies and cattle ranchers. With the growing presence of timber and cattle interests, conservationists began to advocate for the preservation of the region. In 1873, John Muir, a renowned naturalist, hiked from Yosemite to the Giant Forest. After the hike, Muir began advocating for federal protection of the canyon.Division of Publications National Park Service, pp 9-14 =Park establishment and early battles= Because of the sequoia's size and durability, the Giant Forest was a region of particular value to loggers. The Kaweah Colony, a socialist colony which lived in the forest until 1892, hoped to profit from lumber production and constructed the first road in the park. Lumber interests did not have a stranglehold on the region, however. The federal government ensured protection of the General Grant Tree in 1880, when it withdrew from sale four acres of land surrounding the tree.Division of Publications National Park Service, 15 Advocacy for protection of the forest gained traction in the 1870s when agricultural interests in the Central Valley sought to end the harmful practices of sheep herders and lumber companies. Local farmers objected to the economic exploitation of the canyon on two levels. First, grazing and lumbering resulted in runoff which impacted farming in nearby towns. Second, locals feared that habitat loss would detract from their scenic and recreational enjoyment of the wilderness. On October 1, 1890, in response to pressure from agricultural interests from citizens in towns such as Visalia and conservationists such as John Muir, who wrote a number of articles in journals describing the lands' beauty, Congress passed a bill that established Yosemite, Sequoia, and General Grant national parks. Tourism in General Grant National Park was limited in its early years. Utilizing the road built by the Kaweah Colony, early tourists camped in the park using tents and temporary shelters. In subsequent years, accommodations and lodgings were constructed to attract visitors. Initially, General Grant National Park was under the supervision of the State of California and protection of the U.S. Army. State officials oversaw tourist issues, while the Army was responsible for park protection. Despite only receiving $8,000 to protect all three California National Parks, the Army protected the parks effectively in its early years. In 1906, the State of California ceded control of the park to the federal government and in 1916, the establishment of the National Park Service permanently placed management of the park with the newly created National Park Service. Even after the establishment of General Grant National Park, private interests sought to profit from the resources within the park. Officials from Los Angeles County hoped to use the park's major rivers, the Kings, Kern, and Kaweah, to harness hydroelectric power for the city, but locals remained wary of the environmental impact of damming. The Mt. Whitney Power Company began development of power stations along the rivers in 1898, and hoped to eventually dam the three rivers to provide power. The 1920 Federal Power Act allowed the federal government to license private corporations to develop water and power projects on public lands. Following the Federal Power Act, the City of Los Angeles filed to build dams on the rivers both within park boundaries and outside the park. The City of Los Angeles' plan was met with extensive resistance from locals, however. Residents of the San Joaquin Valley spearheaded the resistance to the proposed dam. After three years, the City of Los Angeles' petition to dam the park's rivers was rejected. However, the fight to prevent the damming of the rivers continued through 1965, when all of Kings Canyon was protected from hydroelectric development. National Park Service logo =Creation of Kings Canyon National Park and recent history= In 1940, General Grant Grove became a section of the newly created Kings Canyon National Park, thanks to the combined efforts of Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, the Sierra Club, and Congress. Kings Canyon National Park included General Grant Grove and Kings Valley, an area that had been outside the protection of General Grant National Park. In order to gain support for the park, Secretary Ickes commissioned naturalist photographer and Sierra Club member Ansel Adams to photograph the area. Adams' photography convinced Congress to sign into law the bill that established Kings Canyon as a national park, with General Grant Grove being annexed into the park's boundaries. Fusing Kings Canyon with General Grant Grove allowed the National Park Service to strengthen the protection and management of the sequoias in both. After World War II, the National Park Service expanded its function to include a new endeavor: scientific research. The Leopold Report, published by Dr. Starker Leopold in 1963, advocated returning the nations' remaining wilderness to conditions similar to those encountered by the first white settlers of North America. In order to do so, the Leopold Report stressed the need to hire scientists to conduct research and maintain the ecosystems within the park. In Sequoia and Kings Canyon, the effects of the Leopold report were felt immediately. Newly hired scientists conducted studies measuring the human impacts on the Giant Forest, overgrazing by deer, and the danger present to threatened species. By 1971, Kings Canyon had a chief scientist, botanist, and several research assistants on staff conducting research that would both preserve the sequoias and provide academic information for future generations. By 1982, park officials began to focus on the deteriorating quality of accommodations in General Grant Grove. Little improvements had been made to the cabins in Grant Grove in the past half century, and park management hoped improving facilities would increase park attendance. The National Park Service drafted an Environmental Impact Statement detailing their plans to expand accommodations in Grant Grove. The National Park Service outlined two options of action. One involved improving existing facilities and the other included adding ninety-eight additional units for tourists. Eventually, the park elected to construct additional units in Grant Grove and improve accommodations on the existing units. The cabins of the Giant Forest Lodge Historic District, which had been placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, were demolished between 1997 and 2000, and the site was restored to a natural state. In 2015, the Rough Fire burned through the northern section of the grove and killed 12 trees with diameters greater than . Environmental concerns =Vandalism and early issues= Even though few visitors traveled to General Grant National Park in its early years, incidents of vandalism were common from the park's inception. Tourists often carved their names into trees and shot arrows into them. The General Grant Tree, the largest in the grove, fell victim to the most vandalism. In order to combat these incidents, the United States Army fenced off the major trees. Sheep overgrazing was another early problem that plagued General Grant National Park. Grazing sheep posed a major threat to the ecosystem of the parks, as sheep overgrazed and killed plant species within park limits. Army officials prevented overgrazing by kicking intruding ranchers and sheep out of the park. =Fire management, a brief history= Fire management has always been a vital issue in park management, although fire policy has changed dramatically since the park's inception. While current management practices in General Grant Grove include prescribed burns, fire suppression was actively followed in the park's early years. In fact, the Army practiced active suppression of fires from the groves' inception, which resulted in a brush buildup throughout the grove. In electing to suppress fires, the Army kept with early 20th century practices of fire control. Since consistent fire maintains the health of a forest ecosystem, the Army and the State of California's practice of fire suppression endangered the grove risk of extensive habitat loss through fire. The creation of the National Park Service in 1916 did not alter fire control policies. The Leopold Report, however, soon did transform fire policy in Kings Canyon. In fact, Dr. Leopold used the sequoia groves in Kings Canyon as evidence of the need for proscribed burning and improved management practices. The 1964 Wilderness Act confirmed the findings of the Leopold Report and mandated controlled burning in the national parks and national forests, including Kings Canyon. As such, the National Park Service reintroduced fire into the grove as a natural process to prevent brush build up. By 1972, Kings Canyon had implemented a proscribed burn plan that spanned the entire park, including General Grant Grove. Controlled burns today remain a vital part of the National Park Service's efforts to manage Kings Canyon and General Grant Grove.King's Canyon Fire Management Giant Trees in General Grant Grove =Ozone pollution, climate change and the groves' future= Another issue of growing importance to the Grove is anthropogenic air pollution. National Park Service employees fear that greenhouse gas emissions have increased temperatures, and that the increased temperatures have already negatively altered the habitats of the national parks and that ozone affects sequoia seedling growth.NPS Climate Friendly Parks Program Research has indicated that climate change has already affected Kings Canyon. Rising temperatures have pushed the snow line higher into the mountains. The higher snow line will likely lessen water storage, change species' habitats, and make fires more severe. Because the sequoias of General Grant Grove thrive under a distinct set of conditions, the impact of climate change could result in habitat loss for the trees, as fewer areas within the park will retain the conditions necessary for the sequoias' survival.Division of Publications National Park Service, 47 Specifically, an increase in the temperature could lead to failure in sequoia regeneration and increased mortality from long droughts. Current restoration plans aim to slow the effects of climate change through reducing air pollution within the parks and the greater San Joaquin Valley. Kings Canyon is among the leading parks in this effort.NPS Climate Friendly Parks Program But since climate change occurs as a result of human activity mainly outside the park, the larger problems of air quality will continue to pose a challenge to the survival of the ancient trees despite efforts by the National Park Service to remedy the impacts.NPS Management EIS The park today General Grant Grove consists of a number of sequoia trees situated around a half-mile loop. Visitors have access to a number of trails, including Big Stump Trail, Redwood Canyon Trail, and the Big Baldy Trail.Grant Grove Homepage The Panoramic Viewpoint also offers unmatched views of the entire grove. From the viewpoint, hikers have access to a lookout at 7,520 feet to the northeast of Grant Grove.General Grant Panoramic Point In addition to the General Grant Tree, which stands a colossal 270 feet tall and 107 feet around, the Robert E. Lee tree stands an imposing 254 feet tall and is the eleventh largest tree in the world.

Astana attained UCI ProTeam status in its inaugural year, 2007. Following a major doping scandal involving Kazakhstani rider Alexander Vinokourov, team management was terminated and new management brought in for the 2008 season. The team was then managed by Johan Bruyneel, former team manager of U.S. Postal/Discovery Channel team. Under Bruyneel the ethical nature of the team did not improve, although Astana in this period was very successful. With a lineup including Grand Tour winner Alberto Contador, as well as runner-up Andreas Kl√∂den the results were there, however the team was on the verge of financial collapse in May 2009. A battle for control of the team led to the return of Vinokourov for the 2009 Vuelta a Espa√±a caused Bruyneel and at least fourteen of its riders to leave at the end of the 2009 season, most for . Only four Spanish riders, including Contador, and most of the Kazakhs remained with the rebuilt team for 2010. Those four Spaniards all left the team for in 2011. History =Demise of Liberty Seguros-W√ºrth= Astana first became involved in sponsoring cycling during the 2006 season. The Spanish Liberty Seguros- W√ºrth team was heavily implicated in the Operaci√≥n Puerto doping case and the sponsors Liberty Mutual, and later W√ºrth, withdrew their sponsorship of the team. Astana stepped in to sponsor the team, and during the second half of the season, Vinokourov won the Vuelta a Espa√±a while riding for the renamed Team Astana, and his Kazakh teammate Andrey Kashechkin finished third. =2007: Formation of the new team= Vuelta-2006 winner The new Astana management initially tried to buy the ProTour licence of the former Liberty Seguros-W√ºrth team, held by Manolo Saiz. However, Saiz was reluctant to sell, so Astana applied for a licence in their own right. Initially, the new team was based in Switzerland under the holding company of Zeus Sarl and managed by former Tour de Suisse organiser Marc Biver. Vinokourov was the team's debut leader. The UCI ProTour license commission first informed Astana that they would not be granted a ProTour License for the 2007 season. Following UCI's decision not to grant a ProTour license, the organizers of the three Grand Tours informed Astana Team that they would be included, regardless of ProTour license status. On 20 December 2006 the UCI License Commission relented and awarded Astana Team a 4-year ProTour license. Other prominent new riders for the 2007 season included stage race specialists Andreas Kl√∂den, Paolo Savoldelli and Andrey Kashechkin, as well as Matthias Kessler, Gr√©gory Rast, Thomas Frei and Spanish climber Antonio Colom. =2008= 2008 team car Riding under a Luxembourgian license, the team also included other ex-Discovery Channel riders such as Tomas Vaitkus, S√©rgio Paulinho, Chechu Rubiera, Vladimir Gusev and Janez Brajkovic, as well as American Chris Horner. Alberto Contador The Astana team was not invited to the 2008 Giro d'Italia based on failing to meet the criteria of ethics, quality, or internationality. However, on 3 May, one week before the start of the race, Giro organizers chose to extend a last-minute invitation to Astana. Astana was able to field a team despite the short notice, and on 1 June, Alberto Contador won the Giro, finishing 11th on the final stage time trial to keep his pink jersey and take the overall victory. Contador also won the 2008 Vuelta a Espa√±a, with teammate Levi Leipheimer finishing a close second. Thus, despite not competing in the Tour de France due to doping by Vinokourov and others in 2007, Astana still won two Grand Tours in 2008 and achieved three podiums. Leipheimer also won a bronze medal in the time trial in the 2008 Olympics, just edging Contador, who finished fourth. Among the other results achieved by the team were victories in several stage races: by Contador in the Vuelta al Pa√≠s Vasco and the Vuelta a Castilla y Le√≥n, by Leipheimer in the Tour of California, by Kl√∂den in the Tour de Romandie and by Russian Sergei Ivanov in the Tour de Wallonie. Various team members also achieved several other top-tier results, and Ivanov, Paulinho, Vaikus and two of the Kazakhs won their national championships. Astana's strict anti-doping policy came to the forefront later in the year. On 28 July Astana fired Vladimir Gusev for showing \\"abnormal values\\" in an internal doping check. In a statement, Bruyneel it said that while the results \\"do not indicate the use of banned substances, the team has therefore applied the contractual terms based on these physiological and biological abnormalities\\", and fired Gusev \\"with immediate effect.\\" On 17 June 2009, almost a year later, the Court of Arbitration in Sport ruled that Bruyneel's company, Olympus sarl, which held the rider contracts, had violated Swiss employment contract law by firing Gusev on the suspicion of doping without prior implementation of the special procedure provided under terms of the contract. The company was ordered to pay Gusev back wages, damages and legal costs. =2009: The return of Lance Armstrong= Lance Armstrong Giro d'Italia On 25 September 2008, it was confirmed that Lance Armstrong ‚Äì at the time considered a seven-time Tour de France winner ‚Äì would leave retirement to ride for the team in the 2009 season. Along with Armstrong, Yaroslav Popovych, another former Discovery Channel rider, joined the ranks of Astana, which brought the number of former Discovery Channel riders on Astana to nine (Armstrong, Popovych, Contador, Leipheimer, Rubiera, Noval, Vaitkus, Paulinho and Brajkoviƒç). It was reported that Armstrong would share team leadership with current leader Contador, that he intended to participate in the Tour Down Under, the Tour of California, Paris‚ÄìNice, the Tour de Georgia, the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© Liber√© and the Tour de France, and that he would receive no salary or bonuses, instead directing his attention to raising awareness for cancer research. Along with Armstrong and Popovych, Astana also signed Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez, who had joined the former Liberty Seguros team in 2004 when Alberto Contador was one of the riders there, and Basque rider Haimar Zubeldia. Contador expressed his support for the return of Vinokourov from his two-year doping suspension but seemed less enthusiastic about Armstrong's return. Armstrong was part of the team that participated in the season's first ProTour race, the 2009 Tour Down Under. The team's first victory of the season was the 6th stage, followed by the general classification, of the Tour of California by Levi Leipheimer. In the same week, Alberto Contador won a stage and the classification of the Volta ao Algarve, and subsequently two stages in the Paris‚ÄìNice race. Armstrong's participation in the Tour was cast into doubt in late March, after he suffered a broken collarbone in the Vuelta a Castilla y Le√≥n that required surgical repair. However, Armstrong was able to recover in time to ride in the 2009 Giro d'Italia. Financial crisis Team time trial at the 2009 Tour de Romandie On 6 May 2009, Astana admitted that it had failed to pay its riders amid the financial crisis in Kazakhstan, but a team spokesman said that this was only a delay, that the team was not in danger of folding, and that the team would compete in the 2009 Giro d'Italia as planned. On 7 May Armstrong, riding for Astana on an unpaid basis, expressed his sympathy for employees waiting for their wages only days before the start of the Giro d'Italia. He also said that if the financial crisis was not resolved, the team's license should be turned over to Bruyneel, which he said was the \\"most logical solution.\\" Organizationally, Astana had an unusual structure. Although the Kazakh team holds the UCI license and pays the salaries, the individual rider contracts and equipment leases are held by Bruyneel's Luxembourg-based Olympus SARL, so the team could continue with merely a license transfer. UCI President Pat McQuaid was planning a visit to Astana during the Giro to discuss the team's future. According to Armstrong: \\"I don't have any concrete answers but I suspect we can find some funding that would get us from June to the end of the year.\\" On 11 May, the UCI set a deadline for resolving Astana's financial situation of 31 May, the last day of the Giro. If the team had not met its financial obligations by that date, it would be suspended by the UCI. Bruyneel noted that at least the team would be able to finish the Giro under its current banner. During stage 7 of the Giro, eight of the nine Astana riders, including Armstrong, rode in jerseys with the non- paying sponsors' names nearly faded out in protest over the team's unpaid salaries and remained in such jerseys for the rest of the Giro. The only rider not to participate was Andrey Zeits from Kazakhstan. According to Bruyneel, the names of paying sponsors, such as Trek and KazMunayGas, were not blanked out, and the team would continue to \\"race with these shirts until everything, emphasis on everything, is fixed\\", as \\"the riders have only received two months of salary in 2009.\\" On 19 May, Bruyneel announced that the sponsors had paid part of the past-due wages since the start of the protest \\"but the major part is still missing.\\" On 3 June the Astana team gave financial guarantees to cycling's governing body which would allow them to compete in the 2009 Tour de France in July, and later that month declared their financial problems to be resolved and the funds secure at least to the end of the season. Vinokourov versus Bruyneel Johan Bruyneel as the director of the Team Astana, 2009 During these financial problems, it was rumored that three of the former Discovery Channel riders on the team ‚Äì team leader Contador and his domestiques Noval and Paulinho ‚Äì would join Garmin-Slipstream for the Tour de France if Armstrong were to take over the Astana team. These problems seemed to be resolved, at least for the remainder of 2009, when the team's funding was resolved. However, the funding battle may have been merely a skirmish related to the underlying issue: control of the Astana team after the expiration of the two-year doping suspension of Alexander Vinokourov on 24 July 2009. On 2 July, Vinokourov stated that he would return to Astana, which he noted was \\"created for me and thanks to my efforts\\", when his suspension ended, and that he would ride for Astana in the 2009 Vuelta a Espa√±a. He stated that he expected to reach agreement with Bruyneel about his return within the week, but that \\"if Bruyneel does not want me, it will be Bruyneel who is leaving the team.\\" The next day, the French newspaper L'Equipe reported that the Kazakh Cycling Federation planned to fire Bruyneel, Armstrong, Leipheimer and many of the other riders and rebuild the team in the model of the old Liberty Seguros team, which was predominantly Spanish. The paper quoted the vice-president of the Kazakh federation as saying, \\"[Contador] will be our sole leader for years to come [and] will be able to pick out the riders he wants to ride with him. In our mind, the team will be composed of Spanish and Kazakh riders, including Alexander Vinokourov.\\" On 21 July, with Contador, Armstrong and Kl√∂den holding three of the top four places in the Tour de France, Bruyneel told Belgian channel VRT that Astana as currently constituted was \\"finished\\" and that he would be leaving the team, as Vinokourov and the Kazakh federation had discussed, at the end of the season. Despite the comments by Vinokourov and the Kazakhstan federation, Bruyneel and Vinokourov did not reach an agreement regarding Vinokourov's return to Astana for 2009, and the team submitted a preliminary roster to the 2009 Vuelta a Espa√±a listing him only as a reserve. Finally, on 24 August, Astana announced that an agreement had been reached between Vinokourov and Bruyneel and that Vinokourov would rejoin the team for the start of the Vuelta. The next day, Armstrong announced that Bruyneel would take over Team RadioShack in 2010. =2010= The immediate result of Vinokourov's return and Bruyneel's departure was a mass exodus from Astana. Although Bruyneel still had a year to run on his contract, Astana permitted his departure in return for him not blocking Vinokourov's return. Contador also had a year on his contract, and Astana refused to permit his departure. However, much of the rest of the team departed for RadioShack, including Armstrong, Kl√∂den, Leipheimer, Zubeldia, Horner, Brajkoviƒç, Popovych, Paulinho, Vaitkus, Rast, Rubiera and Muravyev (the only Kazakh to depart), which meant that eight of the nine members of the winning Astana team at the 2009 Tour de France moved to RadioShack. Additionally, Sch√§r and Morabito joined . All that remained of Astana was four Spanish riders (Contador, Noval, Navarro and Hern√°ndez) and the Kazakhs (except Muravyev). Subsequently, the team signed three more Spanish riders, including 2006 Tour champion √ìscar Pereiro,Associated Press, \\"Oscar Pereiro agrees deal to join Astana team for one year\\", The Guardian, Dec. 9, 2009. Retrieved 12-24-2009. to support Contador. Consistent with the July 2009 plan, the 2010 team included 12 Kazakhs and 7 Spaniards among its 26 riders. =2013‚Äì2016: Nibali era= When Contador left the team after the 2010 season, the Spanish faction of the team declined, to be replaced by an Italian element; in 2011 and 2012, the team signed Enrico Gasparotto, Mirco Lorenzetto, Francesco Masciarelli, Jacopo Guarnieri, Francesco Gavazzi, Simone Ponzi, and Fabio Aru, while in the same period of time David de la Fuente, Daniel Navarro, Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez, Benjam√≠n Noval, √ìscar Pereiro, and Josep Jufr√© resigned, so that by the beginning of the 2012 season there were no Spanish riders of the team. In 2013, the team signed Valerio Agnoli, Andrea Guardini, Alessandro Vanotti, and Vincenzo Nibali, who immediately won Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico and the Giro d'Italia. Then Nibali wore the leader's jersey more than any other Italian in the history of the Vuelta (13 stages out of 21), but lost first place to American Chris Horner (RadioShack-Nissan). In 2014, Vincenzo Nibali won the Tour de France and became the sixth cyclist who have won the three Grand Tours. In August the team announced they had signed Lars Boom (), Luis Le√≥n S√°nchez (), Davide Malacarne () & Diego Rosa () for the 2015 season. On August 20, the team announced the signing of Rein Taaram√§e () on a one-year deal. With the 2014 addition of Michele Scarponi and in 2015, Dario Cataldo, the team at the beginning of the 2015 season, had a plurality Italian element, with 9 riders out of 25, and only 5 Kazakh riders remaining. =Doping controversies= The team recorded its first doping positive in April, 2007, when Matthias Kessler tested positive for testosterone following a surprise control in Charleroi and later analysis of his B-sample. Later in July, Eddy Mazzoleni, left the team after allegations of doping usage. Mazzoleni, who had finished 3rd in the 2007 Giro d'Italia, was later suspended for two years for his alleged involvement in the Oil for Drugs doping case. On the eve of the 2007 Tour de France, Alexander Vinokourov confirmed he had received coaching from controversial doctor Michele Ferrari. The next positive doping result came from team-leader Vinokourov, after a positive result for blood doping (blood transfusion). As a result, ASO (the organisers of the Tour de France) \\"invited\\" Team Astana's management to withdraw the entire team from the Tour de France; this invitation was immediately accepted. Following confirmation that Vinokourov's B-sample had also tested positive, the Astana Team announced that he had been sacked with immediate effect. On 1 August 2007, fellow Kazakh Andrey Kashechkin tested positive for homologous blood doping following an out-of-competition test in Belek, Turkey. He was suspended and subsequently fired. This was followed by the termination of Jos√© Antonio Redondo's contract after \\"failing to abide by team rules\\", making him the fifth rider of the team to leave during the 2007 season. Following the doping problems of 2007, the sponsors of Astana replaced Biver with Johan Bruyneel, the former directeur sportif of the defunct Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team. Bruyneel had the mandate to start afresh with the team, so he hired a number of former Discovery riders including 2007 Tour de France winner Alberto Contador (who had ridden with Vinokourov on the old Liberty Seguros team) and third-place finisher Levi Leipheimer. Additionally, Bruyneel introduced the anti-doping system developed by Dr. Rasmus Damsgaard, Head of Information for Anti Doping Danmark (ADD). The anti-doping system was initially used by Team CSC starting in 2007.Bruyneel to head new-look Astana team in 2008 ‚Äì Cycling ‚Äì Yahoo! Sports The link between the Discovery Channel team and Astana was strengthened when Bruyneel signed a contract with Trek Bicycle Corporation to supply the team with bicycles and components, as they had done with Discovery Channel. Bruyneel also affirmed sponsorship with SRAM, the component maker. On 13 February 2008, the organisers of both the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France announced that Astana would be barred from their 2008 Grand Tours, due to the team's links to Operaci√≥n Puerto and involvement in the 2007 Tour doping scandals. This meant that Contador was unable to defend his Tour crown, because his contract did not have an \\"escape clause\\" that covered Astana's current situation. One week before the 2008 Giro d'Italia, the organisers went on to invite the team to the race, a race which Alberto Contador went on to win. In July, Vladimir Gusev was sacked by the team due to \\"irregular values\\" highlighted by the team's new, internal, anti-doping system. In 2009, after returning from retirement, Lance Armstrong was accused by the French anti- doping agency of acting improperly by disappearing from the sight of the anti- doping investigator for 20 minutes. In June, Assan Bazayev was given a two- week internal suspension for not correctly reporting his whereabouts properly. In September 2010, Alberto Contador returned a positive doping test for Clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France. After a two-year legal procedure, Contador is stripped of his 2010 Tour de France win (and 2011 Giro d'Italia victory). In 2011, Roman Kreuziger finished 5th at the Giro d'Italia as well as winning the best young rider classification. In 2014, the UCI began proceedings against him for biological passport anomalies dated from 2011 and 2012 ‚Äì the two years he spent at Astana. In 2012, former Astana riders and staff including; Lance Armstrong, Johan Bruyneel, Levi Leipheimer, Dr. Pedro Celaya and Dr. Luis del Moral are heavily implicated in the mass doping scandal which surrounded the U.S. Postal /Discovery Channel team. In September 2014, it emerged that Valentin Iglinskiy has returned a positive test for EPO http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/CleanSport/16/67/88/20141009ADRVProvisionalSuspensionEN_English.pdf at the Eneco Tour, he confessed to doping to the team and was immediately sacked, three weeks later Valentin's brother, Maxim Iglinskiy was provisionally suspended by the UCI for an EPO-positive on August 1. It was later announced that Astana withdrew themselves from the Tour of Beijing per the MPCC rules, who state that a team with 2 positives in a short period of time must not participate in the next World Tour event. Subsequently, a sample taken at the Tour de l'Avenir in August from Ilya Davidenok, a rider with the Astana Continental Team and a stagiaire with the Astana Pro Team, tested positive for anabolic steroids. Davidenok was provisionally suspended, and a review into the team's licence was announced following the positive tests for Davidenok and the Iglinskiy brothers. =University of Lausanne independent audit= On February 27, 2015, cycling's governing body, the UCI, requested that the team's WorldTour licence be withdrawn following an audit of its doping controls by the Institute of Sport Sciences in Lausanne. The UCI stated that the audit revealed a large difference between the team policies presented to the Licence Commission and reality. On 23 April 2015, it was finally announced by the UCI that Astana would keep their license but would be under more scrutiny.

As its name implies, it was originally a Roman castrum or fortress. It lies at the north-west edge of the Lincolnshire Wolds, on the Viking Way, and just off the A46 between Lincoln and Grimsby, at the A46, A1084, A1173 and B1225 junction. It has a population of 2,601. Its name comes from the Anglo-Saxon ceaster (\\"Roman camp\\" or \\"town\\") and was given in the Domesday Book as Castre. Buildings Only a few fragments of the 4th-century walls remain; for example, the original Roman wall is visible on the southern boundary of the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. The area occupied by the fortress is now classified as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The church of St Peter and St Paul, which is enclosed within the fortress, has an Anglo- Saxon tower. The market square lies at the heart of a conservation area which contains 56, mainly Grade II, listed buildings. In numerical terms, the number of listed buildings makes Caistor the most important conservation area in the West Lindsey area; many of the buildings are Georgian or Victorian. Notable buildings in the town include Caistor Grammar School, founded in 1633, and Sessions House, built in 1662. In 2010 the remains of a 4th-century Roman cemetery were found during the development of a new Co-op supermarket.  Education  =Grammar school= Caistor Grammar School dates from the reign of Charles I. An academy with a selective pupil intake, it has specialist school status for sports and humanities.

Role of climber in a race In a sustained climb, the average speed declines, the aerodynamic advantage of drafting is diminished and the setting of the group pace becomes more important. A good climber modulates his speed and chooses the best line on a climb, allowing the following riders to have an easier job. If the group maintains a high tempo, it is more difficult for a rider to attack and ride away from the group. Another important role in climbing is that of attacker or counter-attacker. Climbing specialists use their superior abilities either to attack on climbs and thereby gap the competitors, knowing that only other climbing specialists will be able to stay with them, or simply to maintain a high pace that others cannot match. A successful escape can help the climber achieve a victory if the race has a mountain-top finish, or even in a flat finish if the climber is able to maintain his lead after the climb is over. Climbing stages, along with individual time trials, are key stages in winning long stage races. In recent years, climbing specialists have been deployed as Super-domestiques, protecting team leaders with All-round capabilities by setting a strong tempo in mountain stages to deter attacks from rivals, a tactic known as a 'train'. Examples of this include Team Sky climbers Wout Poels, Mikel Landa and Mikel Nieve helping Chris Froome in his multiple Grand Tour victories. Froome himself played a similar role in service of Bradley Wiggins at the 2012 Tour de France Types of climbers Nairo Quintana climbing in the race leader's Maglia Rosa at the 2014 Giro d'Italia Climbers tend to have a lot of endurance and specifically developed muscles for long hard climbs. They also tend to have a slim, lightweight physique, but some can become good climbers through concerted training. The most successful climbing specialists come in different shapes and specializations. Climbers with very small physique such as Jos√© Rujano (48 kg), Nairo Quintana (58 kg), Roberto Heras (60 kg), Alberto Contador (61 kg) and Gilberto Simoni (58 kg) thrive when the climbs reach dizzying heights and incredibly steep slopes where their low weight makes them more efficient and able to put in repeated acceleration runs. Their endurance also makes them good stage race specialists. Marco Pantani, champion of the 1998 Tour de France, was able to make attack after attack to quickly tire out his opponents. Another type of rider or puncheur has a similarly small physique but possess more power which may provide an advantage in short but steep climbs in races including the Ardennes classics. Examples of such hills include the Mur de Huy in the Fl√®che Wallonne and the Cauberg in the Amstel Gold Race. Examples of such riders include Julian Alaphilippe, Philippe Gilbert, Paolo Bettini and Danilo Di Luca, who are able to sprint their way up the shorter climbs to win a stage or a single-day race. However, their lower endurance is a disadvantage in stage races where the climbs are usually longer, albeit at lower gradients. Many climbers cannot sprint very well because their relative small size does not allow them to match the strength of the bigger, more muscular sprinters. The last type of climber is the breakaway specialist who can ride aggressively with many attacks and sustain their lead over ascents, descents, and flats. Famous examples include Laurent Jalabert and Richard Virenque both of whom earned their King of the Mountains jerseys in the Tour de France by day-long breakaways amassing points at every summit. Most notably, Laurent Jalabert started his career as a sprinter but later transformed himself into a different type of rider. Rafal Majka won the Polka Dot jersey at the 2014 Tour de France and 2016 Tour de France in a similar manner. Many riders who are primarily time-trialists have also been able to compete in everything but the steepest climbs because of their good power-to-weight ratio. Tour de France winners Miguel Indurain, Jan Ullrich and Bradley Wiggins were primarily time- trialists but were also among the best in the mountain stages during the years in which they won the Tour de France. Likewise, Tom Dumoulin was able to win the 2017 Giro d'Italia by defending the lead he had built in the individual time trial in subsequent mountain stages. Climbing physics and physiology Alberto Contador wearing the yellow jersey leading Andy Schleck wearing the white jersey at the 2009 Tour de France. Sports physiologists have attributed the advantage that small stature holds in cycling up steep ascents to the way in which body mass and body surface area scale according to height (see square-cube law). As a hypothetical cyclist's height increases, the surface areas of his body increase according to the square of his height whereas the mass of his body increases according to the cube of his height. The surface area relation applies not only to the total surface area of the body, but also to the surface areas of the lungs and blood vessels, which are primary factors in determining aerobic power. Thus, an equally proportioned cyclist who has 50% more body mass (i.e. is 50% heavier) will generate only about 30% more aerobic power. On a steep climb most of the cyclist's energy goes into lifting his own weight, so the heavier cyclist will be at a competitive disadvantage. There is, of course, a lower limit to the benefit of small stature because, among other factors, the cyclist must also lift the weight of his bicycle. The additional power is proportional to the grade or slope of the road and the speed of the rider along the slope (or along the level line). For a 5% grade, each meter of road requires lifting the body weight by 5 cm. The power (watts) is equal to change in gravitational potential energy (joules) per unit time (seconds). For a rider, the additional power needed is about 30 watts per meter/second of road speed (about 8 watts per km/hour). Scaling factors also account for the relative disadvantage of the small cyclist in descending, although this is a result of physics, not physiology. A larger rider will be subject to a greater gravitational force because of their greater body mass. Additionally, as mentioned, the frontal area that creates aerodynamic drag increases only quadratically with the rider's size, and hence the larger rider would be expected to accelerate faster or attain a greater terminal velocity. Although these factors might seem to cancel each other out, the climber still has an advantage on a course with long ascents and long descents: adding several miles per hour on a slow, time-consuming climb is much more valuable than the same increase on a fast and brief descent. Any rider, of course, can improve her climbing speed by increasing her aerobic power and reducing her body weight and can increase her descending speed through better bike handling and the willingness to accept an increased risk of crashing. One of the few elite riders to use descending skill as a competitive advantage is Paolo Savoldelli, nicknamed \\"the falcon.\\" For a more quantitative treatment of climbing physics and physiology, see Swain, DP, Cycling: Uphill and Downhill . Bicycle technology Recent advances in bicycle components give the rider a wider range of gearing choices, allowing climbing specialists to use lower gears to ascend optimally while still having the higher gears necessary to keep up with other riders in the flatter sections. Legendary climbers of the past such as Lucien Van Impe had to ride out of the saddle pushing high gears for hours at a time; climbers today are better able to match their gearing to the challenge and climb at a more reasonable cadence. The current UCI minimum limit for the mass of bicycles is . Although many bike manufacturers can create bikes much lighter than this, the UCI deems this weight fair in the spirit of preserving the 'primacy of man' over his equipment.

In the Tour de France for example, the best climber, or \\"King of the Mountains\\", is awarded a polka dot jersey (French: maillot √† pois rouges).

The nuclear cross section of uranium-235 for slow thermal neutrons is about 1000 barns, while for fast neutrons it is in the order of 1 barn. Therefore thermal neutrons are more likely to cause uranium-235 to nuclear fission than to be captured by uranium-238. If at least one neutron from the U-235 fission strikes another nucleus and causes it to fission, then the chain reaction will continue. If the reaction will sustain itself, it is said to be critical, and the mass of U-235 required to produce the critical condition is said to be a critical mass. Thermal reactors consist of the following: * Neutron moderator to slow down the neutrons. In light water reactors and heavy water reactors it doubles as the nuclear reactor coolant. * Nuclear fuel, which is a fissile material, usually uranium. * Reactor vessel that is a pressure vessel containing the coolant and reactor core. * Radiation shielding to protect people and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. * Containment buildings which are designed to contain the escape of radiation in an emergency. * Instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor's systems.

Life =Early years= Born in Venice into an aristocratic family, the grandson of the opera composer Francesco Malipiero, Gian Francesco Malipiero was prevented by family troubles from pursuing his musical education in a consistent manner. His father separated from his mother in 1893 and took Gian Francesco to Trieste, Berlin and eventually to Vienna. The young Malipiero and his father broke up their relationship bitterly, and in 1899 Malipiero returned to his mother's home in Venice, where he entered the Venice Liceo MusicaleÔºànow the Conservatorio Benedetto Marcello di VeneziaÔºâ.John C.G.

After stopping counterpoint lessons with the composer, organist and pedagogue Marco Enrico Bossi, Malipiero continued studying on his own by copying out music by such composers as Claudio Monteverdi and Girolamo Frescobaldi from the Biblioteca Marciana, in Venice, thereby beginning a lifelong commitment to Italian music of that period. In 1904 he went to Bologna and sought out Bossi to continue his studies, at the Bologna Liceo Musicale (now the Conservatorio Giovanni Battista Martini). In 1906 he returned to the Venice Conservatory Benedetto Marcello of Music to continue his studies. After graduating, Malipiero became an assistant to the blind composer Antonio Smareglia. =Musical career= In 1905 Malipiero returned to Venice, but from 1906 to 1909 was often in Berlin,Laureto Rodoni, ¬´Caro Lualdi‚Ä¶¬ª. I rapporti d'arte e d'amicizia tra G.F.Malipiero e A.Lualdi alla luce di alcune lettere inedite, following Max Bruch classes. Later, in 1913, Malipiero moved to Paris, where he became acquainted with compositions by Ravel, Debussy, Falla, Schoenberg, and Berg. Most importantly, he attended the premi√®re of Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps, soon after meeting Alfredo Casella and Gabriele d'Annunzio. He described the experience as an awakening \\"from a long and dangerous lethargy\\". After that, he repudiated almost all the compositions he had written up to that time, with the exception of Impressioni dal vero (1910‚Äì11). At that time he won four composition prizes at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, by entering five compositions under five different pseudonyms. In 1917, due to the Italian defeat at Caporetto, he was forced to flee from Venice and settled in Rome. In 1923, he joined with Alfredo Casella and Gabriele D'Annunzio in creating the Corporazione delle Nuove Musiche. Malipiero was on good terms with Benito Mussolini until he set Pirandello's libretto La favola del figlio cambiato, earning the condemnation of the fascists. Malipiero dedicated his next opera, Giulio Cesare, to Mussolini, but this did not help him. He was a professor of composition at the Parma Conservatory from 1921 to 1924. In 1932 he became professor of composition at the then Venice Liceo Musicale, which he directed from 1939 to 1952. Among others, he taught Luigi Nono and his own nephew Riccardo Malipiero. After permanently settling in the little town of Asolo in 1923,John C.G. Watherhouse (1993). \\"Gian Francesco Malipiero (1883‚Äì1973)\\". In Symphonies nos.1 and 2 ¬∑ Sinfonie del silenzio e della morte (pp. 3‚Äì5) [CD booklet]. Germany: Naxos. Malipiero began the editorial work for which he would become best known, a complete edition of all of Claudio Monteverdi's oeuvre, from 1926 to 1942, and after 1952, editing much of Vivaldi's concerti at the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi. Compositions Malipiero had an ambivalent attitude towards the musical tradition dominated by Austro-German composers, and instead insisted on the rediscovery of pre-19th-century Italian music. His orchestral works include seventeen compositions he called symphonies, of which however only eleven are numbered. The first was composed in 1933, when Malipiero was already over fifty years old. Prior to that, Malipiero had written several important orchestral pieces but avoided the word \\"sinfonia\\" (symphony) almost completely. This was due to his rejection of the Austro-German symphonic tradition. The only exceptions to that are the three compositions Sinfonia degli eroi (1905), Sinfonia del mare (1906) and Sinfonie del silenzio e della morte (1909‚Äì1910). In such early works, the label \\"symphony\\" should not, however, be interpreted as indicating works in the Beethovenian or Brahmsian symphonic style, but more as symphonic poems. When asked in the mid-1950s by the British encyclopedia The World of Music, Malipiero listed as his most important compositions the following pieces: * Pause del Silenzio for the orchestra, composed in 1917 * Rispetti e Strambotti for string quartet, composed in 1920 * L'Orfeide for the stage, composed between 1918 and 1922, and first performed in 1924 * La Passione, a mystery play composed in 1935 * his nine symphonies, composed between 1933 and 1955 (he would compose additional symphonies in the years after this list was made) He regarded Impressioni dal vero, for orchestra, as his earliest work of lasting importance. Musical theory and style Malipiero was strongly critical of sonata form and, in general, of standard thematic development in composition. He declared: Malipiero's musical language is characterized by an extreme formal freedom; he always renounced the academic discipline of variation, preferring the more anarchic expression of song, and he avoided falling into program music descriptivism. Until the first half of the 1950s, Malipiero remained tied to diatonism, maintaining a connection with the pre-19th-century Italian instrumental music and Gregorian chant, moving then slowly to increasingly eerie and tense territories that put him closer to total chromaticism. He did not abandon his previous style but he reinvented it. In his latest pages, it is possible to recognize suggestions from his pupils Luigi Nono and Bruno Maderna. His compositions are based on free, non-thematic passages as much as in thematic composition, and seldom do movements end in the keys in which they started. When Malipiero approached the symphony, he did not do so in the so-called post-Beethovenian sense, and for this reason authors rather described his works as \\"sinfonias\\" (the Italian term), to emphasize Malipiero's fundamentally Italian, anti-Germanic approach. He remarked: As Ernest Ansermet once declared, \\"these symphonies are not thematic but 'motivic': that is to say Malipiero uses melodic motifs like everyone else [...] they generate other motifs, they reappear, but they do not carry the musical discourse ‚Äì they are, rather, carried by it\\". Reception The French conductor Antonio de Almeida led the Moscow Symphony Orchestra in recordings of the complete Malipiero symphonies for Naxos (Marco Polo, 1993‚Äì1994). Recently, Malpiero's piano repertoire, including his complete concertos, has experienced a revival at the hands of noted Italian pianist Sandro Ivo Bartoli.

Each .swf episode weighed 170-400KB (some weighed 3MB), and consists mainly of sarcastic (and frequently absurd) commentary on contemporary Russian life. Some of the most popular episodes include one in which Masyanya and Hryundel' snicker and later hysterically laugh while Hryundel' is recording a jingle on the radio; another involves a sexual encounter made impossible by the lack of \\"shtuchki\\" (thingies), while yet another involves the two main characters exchanging a series of increasingly awful gifts, including a horse-shaped pi√±ata and a bag of green cats. The episodes are generally loosely connected and the characters initially did not age. For most of the episodes, no particular sequence or storyline could be established until recently as Masyanya and Hryundel now have two kids Uncle Badya and Chuchun.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWzVBUlCxow They can be watched in any order, but some episodes lose a great deal of their charm if one isn't familiar with at least some of the series history. Soundtrack Russian pop songs are often used in the soundtracks of episodes. Several episodes are, in essence, music videos set to a particular song. Reception Masyanyas popularity is rapidly growing on both sides of the Atlantic. In Russia, Masyanya made the move from the Internet to television and can now be seen on several cartoons and talk shows, although its popularity is mainly supported by the Internet. In Germany, translations are being made of some of the more popular episodes. In the United States, Masyanya has become an integral feature of the Middlebury College Summer Russian Language Program in Vermont.

The World Journal Tribune represented an attempt to save the heritages of several historic New York City newspapers by merging the city's three mid-market papers (the Journal-American, the World-Telegram and Sun and the Herald Tribune) together into a consolidated newspaper. Background The late 1940s and the 1950s were a troubled time for newspapers throughout North America. Newspapers had acquired a new competitor for the eyes and ears of the nation, television. Competition from radio and magazines for the news audience also continued unabated. The market for evening papers in particular was affected by television and by the suburban lifestyle, but all papers were affected by it. The New York media market was by far America's largest at the time (by an even larger margin than it is currently) and had by far the most daily newspapers. Mergers had been ongoing for several years. In the 1960s the market became even more competitive, forcing the closure of the Hearst-owned New York Daily Mirror in 1963. The newspaper industry was struggling with financial troubles by the mid-1960s and had warned their unions, some of the more militant in the city at the time, that they could not survive yet another strike following devastating walk-outs in 1962‚Äì1963 and 1965. Merger In April 1966, in an attempt to avoid closing down, the Scripps-Howard owned New York World-Telegram and Sun merged with Hearst's New York Journal-American and the New York Herald Tribune to become the New York World Journal Tribune, an evening broadsheet newspaper which would rely on newsstand sales to survive. The management of the merged paper told their employees that to succeed the new enterprise would need concessions from the unions, but the unions, upset that several thousand workers were planned to be laid-off, demanded their own concessions from management.\\"New Show, Old Cast\\" Time magazine (22 April 1966) The result of the impasse was a 140-day strikeSchneider, Daniel B. \\"F.Y.I.\\" New York Times (19 January 1997) which delayed the debut of the new paper until September 12, 1966.Associated Press (13 September 1966). New Paper is Born in New York, Sarasota Herald-Tribune Closing The World Journal Tribune never became economically viable, and it ceased publication eight months later, on May 5, 1967.Associated Press (6 May 1967). World Journal Trib Conceived In High Hopes; Lost Anyway, The Daytona Beach News-Journal During its short life, the paper never opened a Washington bureau, and did not have any foreign correspondents on its staff, relying instead on the Los Angeles Times‚ÄìWashington Post News Service for foreign coverage. The folding of the WJT left the New York Times, the New York Daily News, and the New York Post as the only daily English-language general circulation newspapers in New York City for many years, when in 1900 there had been fifteen.Tifft, Susan E. & Jones, Alex S. The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times Boston: Back Bay, 2000. Google BooksThe end of World Journal Tribune represented the end also of all the predecessor newspapers that had previously been absorbed by the three papers that merged, including the Advertiser, the American, the Evening Telegram, the Herald, the Journal, the Press, the Sun, Tribune and the World. Jackson, Kenneth T. The Encyclopedia of New York New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. Of the three remaining papers, only the first was a broadsheet with a reputation for quality journalism, the other two were tabloids which often lived up to their reputation for sensationalism. The News inherited most of the features of the WJT. One survivor of the demise of the World Journal Tribune was New York magazine, which began as the Sunday supplement for the Herald Tribune and continued after the merger as the supplement for the WJT. After the newspaper folded, the editor of New York, Clay Felker, bought the rights to the title with partners and brought it out as a glossy magazine. In 2016 the World Journal Tribune nameplate was revived as a mobile news site by the journalism organization, Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corporation.

Life and political career Riffe, a moderate Democrat, was a strong Speaker, even bringing Republican members of the House under his sway by threatening to fund the campaigns of their Democratic opponents for re-election. Riffe, who hailed from the impoverished Appalachian Region of southeastern Ohio, fought hard to bring money for development to his corner of the state. Riffe's efforts resulted in the creation of Shawnee State University in Portsmouth, sometimes referred to as \\"Vern Riffe U.\\" He also brought funding to southern Ohio for the building of a major highway, Ohio 32, disparaged as the \\"Highway to Nowhere,\\" which starts in the countryside near Athens, Ohio, in the east and winds its way westward across Southern Ohio, finally ending in rural Clermont County east of Cincinnati. At the time of its construction it traversed no major population centers, stopping short of both Cincinnati and Athens. Today, it is referred to as the Appalachian Highway or the James A. Rhodes Appalachian Highway. Riffe has been honored by several state agencies in Ohio. The Vernal Riffe Chair, a professorship in government at The Ohio State University is named after him.

It is a high mountain pass (elevation ) on the eastern end of the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas around from Manali. It connects the Kullu Valley with the Lahaul and Spiti Valleys of Himachal Pradesh, India. Geography The pass provides a natural divide between the Kullu Valley with a primarily Hindu culture (in the south), and the arid high-altitude Lahaul and Spiti valleys with a Buddhist culture (in the north). The pass lies on the watershed between the Chenab and Beas basins. On the southern side of this pass, the Beas River emerges from underground and flows southward and on its northern side, the Chandra River (flows from the eastern Himalayas), a source stream of the river Chenab, flows westward. Overview The pass is open from May to November. It is not particularly high or difficult to cross on foot by Himalayan standards, but it has a well-deserved reputation for being dangerous because of unpredictable snowstorms and blizzards. This pass is an ancient trade route between the people on either side of Pir Panjal. The local name for this pass is a generic name of pass. There are many other passes in Lahaul and Spiti which have specific names (Kunzam La, Baralacha La, etc.). This is suggestive of the fact that this must have been the oldest and most frequented pass in the region, or the fact that it is the main pass leading from one cultural region to another, quite different one, to the north. The name Rohtang comes from Persian/ Farsi words Ruh+ Tang which means pile of dead bodies. The former National Highway 21 (NH 21, now numbered NH 3), the road through the Kullu Valley, terminates at Manali. The road northwards over the Rohtang Pass to Keylong in Lahaul and Spiti district and on to Leh in Ladakh is not a national highway. Nonetheless, the Leh-Manali Highway has become very busy during the summer months as an alternate military route since the Kargil Conflict in 1999. Traffic jams are common as military vehicles, trucks, and goods carriers try to navigate the tight roads and rough terrain, compounded by snow and ice at certain points and the large number of tourist vehicles.

A rise in average temperature, and the consequent melting of glaciers, are also issues of severe concern.  Climate  The Rohtang pass has polar climate k√∂ppen (ET) and snow falls sometimes even in summer.[Citation needed]  Latest News  Sometimes travelling to Rohtang Pass is difficult. Therefore, the government is stressing on setting up a ropeway between Kothi village which is in Manali and Rohtang Pass. The NGT (National Green Tribunal) has asked the state government of Himachal Pradesh to complete all the formalities to start a ropeway. With the coming of a ropeway, we can reduce carbon emission from vehicles. Heavy snowfall blocks the road in winter and a ropeway will be very useful. View of Rothang Pass Road tunnel under the Pass As the pass gets blocked by snow and the road over the pass closes from November to May rendering Lahaul and Spiti districts north of the pass inaccessible, a need was felt to build a tunnel under the pass. The road tunnel called Atal Tunnel has been excavated and became operational on 3rd October 2020 after formal inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It obviates the need to travel over the Rohtang Pass. While it takes 4 to 6 hours to ascend, negotiate and descend the Rohtang Pass, travel through the Rohtang Tunnel takes only about 30 minutes.

During his career, he played for the New York Highlanders (1905‚Äì1913), Chicago White Sox (1913‚Äì1914), Buffalo Blues (1914‚Äì1915), Cincinnati Reds (1916‚Äì1918), and New York Giants (1919). Babe Ruth and Walter Johnson named Chase the best first baseman ever, and contemporary reports described his glovework as outstanding. He is sometimes considered the first true star of the franchise that would eventually become the New York Yankees. In 1981, 62 years after his last major league game, baseball historians Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. Despite being an excellent hitter and his reputation as a peerless defensive player, Chase's legacy was tainted by a litany of corruption. He allegedly gambled on baseball games, and also engaged in suspicious play in order to throw games in which he played. He was also indicted as an early conspirator in the 1919 Black Sox scandal but was acquitted. Career Chase attended Santa Clara College, where he played baseball. He signed his first contract with the Los Angeles Angels of the Class-A Pacific Coast League in 1904. The New York Highlanders selected Chase from Los Angeles in the 1904 Rule 5 draft on October 4, 1904. Chase joined the Highlanders in 1905, and held out during March 1907, threatening to sign with the outlaw California League if the Highlanders did not increase his salary to $4,000.The Pittsburgh Press via Google News Archive SearchThe Meriden Daily Journal via Google News Archive Search Though he agreed to join the Highlanders in April 1907,The Meriden Daily Journal via Google News Archive Search he also insisted on playing in the California League during the winter.The Toledo News-Bee via Google News Archive Search After the Highlanders fired manager Clark Griffith during the 1908 season, Chase held out and insisted he would not play for new manager Kid Elberfeld.The Day via Google News Archive Search Chase loved playing in the off season in California leagues, which he did nearly every year. And nearly every year, as the major league season approached, Chase looked for a way to remain playing in California. The National Commission ruled that any player who continued in the California league would be suspended from the leagues. Chase continued to play under a pseudonym, Hal Schultz, even as other players returned. Because of the power of the National Agreement and insufficient finances of leagues and teams in California, Chase predictably returned to his major league team and was reinstated in 1908. He left the team again and returned to the California League in September of the 1908 season. Chase reportedly had been angry that Kid Elberfeld was hired over him to manage the team. He claimed that the Yankees‚Äô management had fed a negative story about him to a local newspaper. He played out the rest of the season and paid a fine to get reinstated for the 1909 season. Late in the 1910 season, Chase took over as player-manager from George Stallings. Stallings alleged that Chase was ‚Äúlaying down‚Äù in games, ostensibly with the goal of replacing Stallings as manager as the team's fortunes sank. He informed the team that he would resign if Chase was not released. In September, Stallings was called to a meeting with Yankees management where he was fired as manager in favor of Chase. In 1911, he managed the team to a 76‚Äì76 record and quit as manager following the season. He signed a three-year contract with the Yankees before the 1913 season,The Gazette Times via Google News Archive Search but his hitting fell off that season, hitting only .221. Chase had battled injuries that impaired his play. Frank Chance stated that he worried that Chase was \\"laying down.\\" Chance clarified that he was referring to the question whether Chase would put forth the effort necessary to overcome the current slump. These factors combined led the team to field offers for the player. On June 1, 1913, Yankees traded him to the Chicago White Sox for Babe Borton and Rollie Zeider.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/aab1d59b Before the 1914 season, Chase jumped from the White Sox to the Buffalo Blues of the Federal League. White Sox owner Charles Comiskey filed an injunction to prevent Chase from playing citing a violation of the reserve clause. Chase challenged the injunction in court and won, becoming one of the only players to successfully challenge the reserve clause. The ensuing animosity between Comiskey and Chase would effectively permanently bar Chase from playing again in the American League. Later career and gambling allegations Following a spell in the short-lived Federal League, he went to the Reds. In 1916, Chase led the NL with a .339 batting average.Ottawa Citizen via Google News Archive Search In 1918, his career in Cincinnati ended after his manager, Christy Mathewson, accused him of ‚Äúindifferent playing‚Äù, or betting on baseball and throwing games. Mathewson suspended him indefinitely. Pitcher Jimmy Ring accused Chase of attempting to bribe him in the through the 1917 season, Chase offered him $50 ($ in current dollar terms) to throw a game against the Giants. Even though Ring refused the team lost the game and Chase paid Ring the money. After Ring reported the incident, Greasy Neale accused Chase of saying that he bragged about winning $500 after a Reds loss and later advised Neale to wager on the Reds before a game. Before the 1919 season, the N.L. President John Heydler held a hearing on Chase. While he found that Chase ‚Äúdid not take baseball or anything else seriously‚Äù, he determined that the charges against Chase were general and unsubstantiated and found him not guilty. The league president noted that in one game where Chase was accused of betting against Cincinnati, he hit a home run to put his team ahead. Cincinnati wanted to rid itself of the player and arranged a trade with the New York Giants for Walter Holke and Bill Rariden. The deal was held up by Reds president August Herrmann because Chase sued the club for back pay from his suspension. The Giants agreed to settle the matter with Chase and the trade went through on February 19, 1919. Before the 1920 season, former player Lee Magee, who later sued the Chicago Cubs for allegedly ‚Äúblackballing‚Äù him from baseball, threatened to release the names of players who had thrown games. One of these players was Chase, with whom Magee played in Cincinnati. Magee charged that he and chase had wagered $500 against Cincinnati on a game against the Boston Braves. Cincinnati won that game with Magee scoring the winning run. The National League president dismissed Magee's claims in that they were based on claims during the 1918 season that he had already ruled were unsubstantiated. The Cubs responded that Magee had confessed to wagering on his own team's game. Magee admitted to this but thought that he was betting on Cincinnati and that Chase told him after the game that they lost the wager. On June 9, 1920, a jury found in favor of the Cubs. In September 1919, Chase and Heinie Zimmerman were dropped from the Giants lineup. In 1920, the league revealed that when Magee confessed to league president John Heydler behind closed doors, Heydler told Giants manager John McGraw to release Chase and Zimmerman. Out of organized baseball In 1920, while playing for the minor Mission League, he allegedly attempted to bribe Spider Baum, a pitcher for the Salt Lake Bees of the Pacific Coast League, to lose a game to the Los Angeles Angels. It turned out to be one of the last games he played in organized baseball. In the aftermath of the Black Sox Scandal, newly appointed Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis declared no player who threw a game or promised to throw a game would ever be allowed in baseball‚Äîeffectively ending any realistic chance of Chase returning to the majors. After an investigation by the league, he was barred from the Pacific Coast League and the Mission Baseball League. Babe Borton, for whom Chase was traded in 1913, was also suspended in the scandal. In late 1920, pitcher Rube Benton accused Chase and Heinie Zimmerman of attempting to bring him $800 to throw a game when the three played for the Giants. As part of his accusation, he charged that Chase informed him that the White Sox would lose the first two games of the 1919 World Series and would lose the series. He also testified that Chase communicated with Bill Burns, one of the key figures in the Black Sox scandal and that Chase won $40,000 betting on the series. In October of that year, a Chicago grand jury indicted him for his role in the Black Sox Scandal, alleging that he brought the idea of throwing the World Series to Abe Attell. California refused extradition because of an incorrectly issued arrest warrant.Paul C. Weiler et al., Sports and the Law: Text, Cases and Problems 134 (4th ed. 2011). Chase and the other accused players were acquitted on August 2, 1921. Chase was recruited and hired by the Nogales Internationals to play first base and manage the club for the 1923 season. Chase played for a team in Williams, Arizona, playing games in other mining towns such as Jerome. In early March 1925, newspapers reported that Chase was negotiating with the President of Mexico to become the commissioner of a new Mexican Baseball League. http://www.bevillsadvocate.com/?page_id=51 Prince Hal and his Arizona Odyssey For a time, Chase was player-manager of an outlaw team in Douglas, Arizona that included Buck Weaver, Chick Gandil and Lefty Williams. It was part of a league run by S.L.A. Marshall, who later said that Chase admitted to throwing a game. A few months later, he tore both Achilles tendons in a car accident. He later drifted to Mexico, where in 1925 he began making plans to organize a professional league. When American League president Ban Johnson got word of it, however, he pressured Mexican authorities to deport Chase. Despite his unsavory past, Chase received a certain amount of National Baseball Hall of Fame support early in its history. During the inaugural Hall of Fame balloting of 1936, Chase garnered 11 votes and was named on 4.9% of the ballots. This total was more votes than 18 future Hall of Famers including such greats as Connie Mack, Rube Marquard, Mordecai \\"Three Finger\\" Brown, Charlie Gehringer, and John McGraw as well as the banned Shoeless Joe Jackson. In 1937, he received 18 votes (9%) which was more than 32 future Hall of Famers. Chase was dropped from the ballot following the 1937 vote. He never received the 75 percent support required for enshrinement, largely due to an informal agreement among the Hall of Fame voters that those deemed to have been banned from baseball should be ineligible for consideration. Baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned all players who had been involved in throwing games, which could have banned Chase from baseball; however Judge Landis never formally ruled on Chase. His career was effectively over by the time Landis was appointed. In his only formal hearing on the matter, National League president John Heydler found him not guilty. Chase spent the rest of his life drifting between Arizona and his native California, working numerous low-paying jobs. Later in life, he expressed considerable remorse for betting on baseball. He lived with his sister in Williams, California and died in a Colusa, California hospital at the age of 64.Meriden Record via Google News Archive Search Chase defensively In his day, Hal Chase was almost universally considered one of the best fielders in the game ‚Äî not just at first base, but at any position, even compared to catchers and middle infielders. In his Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James quotes a poem entitled \\"You Can't Escape 'Em\\": Sometimes a raw recruit in spring is not a pitching find; He has not Walter Johnson's wing, nor Matty's wonderous mind. He does not act like Harold Chase upon the fielding job, But you may find in such a case, he hits like Tyrus Cobb. Douglas Dewey and Nicholas Acocella's book on Chase, The Black Prince Of Baseball, talks about Chase's defensive abilities at length. He apparently made many spectacular plays that burnished his reputation as a glove wizard, but also committed 402 errors at first in just ten seasons, making his career fielding average only .980, four points below average for the period (since Chase was known to throw games, it's impossible to know how many of these misplays were intentional). A more recent work by Bill James, Win Shares, suggested Chase was only a C-grade defensive player at first base. According to analyst Sean Smith of Baseball-Reference.com, Chase was below average defensively, costing his teams 65 runs versus an average first baseman.

Cycling teams are most important in road bicycle racing, which is a team sport, but collaboration between team members is also important in track cycling and cyclo-cross. Composition While riders form the core of a team, a top team also has personnel who support the racing and training. These include *A manager, who oversees the team's commitments, sponsorships, and general operation. *Directeurs sportifs, who travel to races and dictate the racing strategy. In bigger teams they often drive team cars and have radio contact with the riders. *Coaches, who direct the team's training. *Doctors, responsible for riders' well-being and often making sure the riders meet regulations such as those related to doping. *Therapists, who assist the coaches. *Soigneurs, who are assistants responsible for feeding, clothing, massaging, and escorting riders; from the French for the \\"one who provides care.\\" *Mechanics, who are responsible for the team's equipment. There are also officers for sponsorship, marketing, and communication. Levels of commitment There are different levels of commitment between the riders and the team. Amateur teams range from a collection of riders who identify themselves as a team to those that provide riders with equipment and money. A top-level professional team is registered with the Union Cycliste Internationale, which enforces rules and a points system for professional competition. Road cycling Team members have different specializations. Climbing specialists grind away on hard inclines; sprinters save their energy for sprints for points and position; time trialists keep speed high over great distances. Each team has a leader, or captain, generally reckoned as the team's best rider. The captains have the most media exposure and best chance of winning races. The rest of the team's members are domestiques, or secondary riders, who shield the captain from opponents and deliver food and drinks to him. However, any team member is allowed to go for a stage win. In one day races, one or several leaders are chosen according to demands of the race. In stage races, teams focus on different goals. For example, during the 2005 Tour de France teams such as Discovery Channel or T-Mobile focused on the general classification while other teams tried to win stages or one of the other classifications. In the 2004 Tour de France, helped Richard Virenque win the mountains classification while helped Robbie McEwen win the points classification. Smaller teams may simply get riders into a long breakaway to get coverage on television. Most professional teams have 10-20 riders. Teams are generally sponsored in exchange for advertising on clothing and other endorsements. Sponsorship ranges from small businesses to international companies. The Tour de France between 1930 and the late 1950s was for national teams which carried no prominent commercial advertising.

The medal was the South Vietnamese equivalent of the United States military's Purple Heart, and was awarded to any personnel of the South Vietnamese military who, while engaged in armed combat with enemies of the Republic of Vietnam, were either wounded or killed in action. During the Vietnam War, the Wound Medal was often issued to Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) personnel for combat wounds received fighting the forces of North Vietnam or the Vietcong. The medal was seldom bestowed upon members of allied militaries such as the United States military and then only if the allied soldier in question was attached and under the direct command of a South Vietnamese unit. For service members of the United States military, the Wound Medal is not authorized for wear on a military uniform. With the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the Wound Medal became obsolete.

It is dedicated to Saint Petroc, [ The Flag Institute] a local saint with numerous dedications throughout Devon. It is notable for its creation through two web- based polls. History The subject of a Devonian flag was raised by the county's contingent of scouts to the 20th World Scout Jamboree in an interview on BBC Radio Devon in 2002. The scouts were unaware of a Devon flag and wondered if any of the listeners knew of a flag for the county. BBC Radio Devon took up the search for a flag for Devon and asked the public to send in designs. The flag was created in 2003 after a vote in two polls run by the BBC Devon website, the winning design taking 49% of the votes cast. The design was created by student Ryan Sealey. The Devon Flag is made of three colours ‚Äî green (Pantone 348), black and white. Although the flag is relatively young, its colours are those traditionally identified with Devon (e.g. the colours of its Rugby Union team, Exeter University and Plymouth Argyle F.C.). In 1816, Lord Exmouth flew a dark green flag with white circles at the Bombardment of Algiers (now on view at the Teign Valley Museum). The green represents the colour of the rolling and lush Devon hills, the black represents the high and windswept moors (Dartmoor and Exmoor) and the white represents both the salt spray of Devon's two coastlines and the China Clay industry (and mining in general). Since its launch in 2003, the Devon Flag has gained popularity, and in October 2006 it gained \\"official\\" recognition when Devon County Council raised the flag outside County Hall. In April 2004, a resident of Ottery St Mary in East Devon was threatened with legal action for flying the Devon flag in his back garden, as he required planning permission to fly non-national flags. Since then the Minister for Housing, Keith Hill, has said local authorities can officially \\"turn a blind eye\\" to the practice of flying the county flag from poles. Devon Ensign Devon Ensign First flown in 2003, the Devon Regatta Ensign (designed by Kevin Pyne) adds a Union flag into the Canton of the Devon Flag - the flag is described as for use at regatta, high days and holidays, weddings, and burials at sea.http://imperialflags.blogspot.co.uk/2007/06/isle-of- man.htmlhttp://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-e-dev.html Flying the Devon Flag The Devon Flag Group have suggested the following dates as days when it is appropriate for the Devon flag to be flown. Most of them are either the days of local events or the feast days of Devon's saints. It is also flown outside of these days, especially in rural towns. *4 January - St Rumon of Tavistock and Romansleigh *7 January - St Brannock of Braunton *5 March - St Piran, patron saint of tin miners *12 March - Paul Aurelian, brother of St Sidwell *7 April - St Brannock, as celebrated in Exeter *1 May - Saint Walpurga of Devon *May Bank Holiday, Anniversary of first time Devon Flag Flown at World Gig Championship 2003, Isles of Scilly *May/June - Devon County Show *3 June - St Kevin *4 June - St Petroc *5 June - St Boniface of Crediton, Patron Saint of Devon *6 June - St Gudwal, hermit of Devon *17 June - St Nectan, patron of Hartland *21/22 June - Midsummers day *26 June - St Brannock - another feast day *5 July - Exeter Lammas Fair *8 July - St Urith of Chittlehampton *13 July - St Juthware *30 July - Anniversary of battle against Spanish Armada *1 August - St Sidwell, Patron Saint of Exeter *10 August - St Geraint Last King of Dumnonia *30 August - St Rumon *26 September - Anniversary of Sir Francis Drake's Circumnavigation of the World *2 November - St Cumgar *5 November - St Kea *7 November - St Congar *8 December - St Budoc (St Budeaux) of Plymouth *12 December - St Corentin *16 December - Saint Judicael, King of Domnon√©e *21/22 December - Midwinter *31 Dec to 6 Jan - New Year's Eve to Twelfth Night Controversy The creation of the flag drew criticism from Cornish nationalists, who accused it online of being an attempt to \\"hijack\\" their culture. Bob Burns, who started the discussion over a flag for Devon, cited the visibility of the Cornish Flag as one of his reasons \\"Devonians are only too aware of the ubiquitous Cornish Flag, which can often be seen in the form of car bumper stickers, on vehicles entering Devon from Cornwall.\\" Dr Mark Stoyle, a Devon historian, noted that \\"People are quite aware in Devon that the Cornish make political capital by claiming to be different.\\" He also suggested that the new-found sense of Devonian identity was a backlash against incoming \\"city-dwellers settling in the South West\\". The decision to dedicate the flag to St Petroc was not without controversy as the saint is equally popular in neighbouring Cornwall, but it was decided that as Devon's 27 church dedications to Saint Petroc far outweighs the 6 dedications in Cornwall, and furthermore that the Devon villages named after the Saint, such as Petrockstowe and Newton St Petroc, gave the county a strong claim to the saint, as Cornwall had already selected Saint Piran as their patron saint many years previously.

A sprinter is a road bicycle racer or track racer who can finish a race very explosively by accelerating quickly to a high speed,Menasp√† Paolo et al. Physical Demands of Sprinting in Professional Road Cycling., Int J Sports Med 2015 often using the slipstream of another cyclist or group of cyclists tactically to conserve energy.Menasp√† Paolo et al.Performance analysis of a world-class sprinter during cycling grand tours., Int J Sports Physiol Perform, 2013 Apart from using sprinting as a racing tactic, sprinters can also compete for intermediate sprints (sometimes called primes), often to provide additional excitement in cities along the route of a race. In stage races, intermediate sprints and final stage placings may be combined in a points classification. For example, in the points classification in the Tour de France, the maillot vert (green jersey) is won by the race's most consistent sprinter. At the Tour de France, the most current successful recipient of this honor is Slovak sprinter Peter Sagan, who has won seven Tour de France green jerseys (2012‚Äì2016, 2018-2019). The road sprinter Sprinters have a higher ratio of fast-twitch muscle fibers than non-sprinters. Road cycling sprinters sometimes tend to have a larger build than the average road racing cyclist, combining the strength of their legs with their upper body to produce a short burst of speed necessary in a closely contested finish.Why sprinters are muscly and climbers are wiry. BBC News https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28363129 Some sprinters have a high top speed but may take a longer distance to achieve it, while others can produce short and sharp accelerations. A sprinter is usually heavier, limiting their speed advantage to relatively flat sections. It is therefore not uncommon for sprinters to be dropped by the peloton (also known as the 'bunch' or 'pack') if a race is through hilly terrain. Sprinters may have different preferences. Some prefer a longer \\"launch\\" while others prefer to 'draft' or slipstream behind their teammates or opponents before accelerating in the final meters. Some prefer slight uphill finishes, while others prefer downhill finishes. Sprinter tactics In conventional road races, sprinters may bide their time waiting until the last few hundred metres before putting on a burst of speed to win the race. Many races will finish with a large group sprinting for the win; some sprinters may have team-mates, so-called domestiques 'leading them out' (i.e., keeping pace high and sheltering the sprinter) so that they have a greater chance of finishing in the leading positions. These teammates tend to \\"peel off\\" one by one as they tire; the last teammate is known as the \\"lead- out sprinter\\" and the best of them are excellent sprinters in their own right. Several of the Classic one day races, for example Milan‚ÄìSan Remo or Paris‚ÄìTours tend to favour sprinters because of their long distance and relatively flat terrain - a long day of racing does not benefit a sprinter per se, however, very long stages or one day races tend to preclude successful breakaways and otherwise aggressive racing, ensuring the race will come down to a bunch sprint. Most editions of these races end in a bunch sprint, often won by racers also successful in the points classification at stage races. Stronger sprinters with abilities in hilly terrain or on cobblestones also have good prospects of winning other major classics such as the Tour of Flanders or the Amstel Gold Race. Famous sprinters The first great pure sprinter in the Tour de France was Frenchman Charles P√©lissier who won eight stages in the 1930 Tour de France, still a record (shared with Eddy Merckx and Freddy Maertens). A year later, P√©lissier battled with Italian sprinter Raffaele di Paco in one of the first major sprinter clashes. Both won five stages. In the 1941 Vuelta a Espa√±a, Delio Rodr√≠guez won 12 stages, followed by 8 the next year. He even managed to win the Overall Classification a few years later. Another successful sprinter of the interbellum was French allrounder Andr√© Leducq. Although he could do more than sprint alone, including winning stage races (winning the Tour de France twice) and classics, 15 of his total 25 stage victories in the Tour were in bunch sprints. Andr√© Darrigade is considered as the greatest French sprinter of all time. He won 22 stages in the Tour de France and twice the Points classification. He also built his legend by winning titles ahead of major cyclists, as the 1955 French National Championship ahead of Louison Bobet and the 1956 Giro di Lombardia ahead of Fausto Coppi. He finished on the podium of the World Championship 4 times in a row and won the title in 1959. Freddy Maertens only participated in six grand tours but took home the Points Jersey on four occasions, winning 12 of his 15 Tour de France stage wins in a bunch sprint. His only participation in Vuelta a Espa√±a in 1977 resulted not only in a record 13 stage wins, but also in the win of the general classification. Just five days after finishing the Vuelta, he went on race the Giro d'Italia, where he won 7 stages before having to abandon the race after a crash halfway through the race. As the sport of cycling progressed into one of more specialized riders in the 1980s, bunch sprints became the arena of specialists - pure sprinters like Guido Bontempi, Jean-Paul van Poppel and Mario Cipollini, all focusing primarily on sprint stages, with other riders (classics specialists, time trialists, climbers etc.) aiming for victories in other types of stages. Cipollini holds the record for most stage wins in the Grand Tours as a sprinter; 57, of which 42 were in the Giro d'Italia. Fellow Italian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi (48 stage wins) won stages and the Points Classification in all three grand tours, including 20 stage wins in the Vuelta. The record for stage wins in the Vuelta belongs to Delio Rodriguez, with 39 wins. Mark Cavendish was named the Tour de France's best sprinter of all time by French paper L'Equipe on July 15, 2012. His tally currently stands on 48 stage wins in Grand Tours, 30 of which have been bunch sprints in the Tour de France. Erik Zabel won a record nine points classifications: six in the Tour de France and three in the Vuelta a Espa√±a. Of the five riders to win the Points classification in all three Grand Tours, three were pure sprinters: Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish. The other two were all-rounders Eddy Merckx and Laurent Jalabert. Peter Sagan won a record seven Points classification in the Tour de France. He won three consecutive World Championship, one European Championship, two Monument races Paris-Roubaix and Tour of Flanders. The only three riders in cycling's history to win stages at all three grand tours in the same calendar year were all sprinters: Miguel Poblet in 1956, Pierino Baffi in 1958 and Alessandro Petacchi in 2003. A good sprint can also secure several victories for other specialists, such as Classics riders and GC- contenders. Se√°n Kelly won 21 stages in the Tour and Vuelta, and the Points Classifications of both races four times each, in addition to his nine major Classics wins. Likewise, Belgian classics specialists Rik Van Steenbergen, Rik Van Looy and Roger de Vlaeminck were very successful due to a good final sprint, as were Italian Giro d'Italia-winners Bepe Saronni and Francesco Moser and their compatriot and two-time World Champion, Paolo Bettini. Conversely, many sprinters use their abilities to win more than just stages, and were successful in classics such as the Tour of Flanders (like Rudi Altig and Jan Raas), Paris‚ÄìRoubaix (Eddy Planckaert) and the Giro di Lombardia (like Andr√© Darrigade) or even stage races (in addition to the aforementioned Leducq, Rodr√≠guez, Maertens, Saronni and Moser, they include Rudi Altig, Sean Kelly and Laurent Jalabert who all won the Vuelta, as did 1968 Tour de France winner and all-rounder Jan Janssen. The ultimate sprinter classic due to its relatively flat course is Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, won four times by Zabel and three times by three-time World Champion √ìscar Freire. Other \\"flat\\" one day races considered important sprinter classics include Gent‚ÄìWevelgem, Scheldeprijs, Vattenfall Cyclassics, Paris-Brussels and Paris‚ÄìTours. =List of successful sprinters= ; Men * Djamolidine Abdoujaparov * Rudi Altig * Pierino Baffi * Marino Basso * Guido Bontempi * Tom Boonen * Mark Cavendish * Mario Cipollini * Andr√© Darrigade * Arnaud D√©mare * Raffaele Di Paco * Caleb Ewan * Urs Freuler * Fernando Gaviria * Andr√© Greipel * Ren√© Le Gr√®ves * Thor Hushovd * Gerben Karstens * Marcel Kittel * Alexander Kristoff * Rik Van Linden * Olaf Ludwig * Robbie McEwen * Charles P√©lissier * Alessandro Petacchi * Miguel Poblet * Jean-Paul van Poppel * Guido Reybroeck * Peter Sagan * Elia Viviani * Patrick Sercu * Tom Steels * Rik Van Steenbergen * Erik Zabel * Dino Zandeg√π ; Women * Anna Meares * Victoria Pendleton * Kristina Vogel * Giorgia Bronzini The track sprinter Sprinting on a cycle track or velodrome ranges from the highly specialised sprint event (where two - sometimes three or more - riders slowly circle the track looking to gain a tactical advantage before launching a finishing burst over the final 200 metres, which is timed), to massed-start events decided by the first across the line after a certain number of laps (similar to road racing). The sprint specialist may also ride short track time trials over 1000 metres, the team sprint and Keirin events. In Madison racing, a team may comprise a specialist sprinter, for when sudden bursts of speed are required, and another rider able to ride at a more consistent high tempo.

The school used the grounds of the former Acklen estate and mansion, with a quadrangle of academic and residential buildings being erected over time on the front lawn. It was regarded as a very prestigious \\"finishing school\\" by the more aristocratic families of Middle Tennessee, although some students were from considerably farther away. History In 1865, William E. Ward and his wife, Eliza Hudson Ward, opened Ward Seminary for Young Ladies in Nashville, Tennessee, to offer \\"a full and thorough course of instruction, embracing academic and collegiate work.\\" In 1870, the Educational Bureau in Washington, DC, ranked Ward Seminary among the top three educational institutions for women in the nation. The school also placed emphasis on athletics, organizing the first girls' varsity basketball team in the South and one of the first in the nation. Belmont College for Young Women, founded by Susan L. Heron and Ida E. Hood, opened on September 4, 1890. Modeled on the women‚Äôs colleges of the Northeast, the school was established on a site centered on Belmont, the home of Adelicia Hayes Franklin Acklen Cheatham, which was built in 1850. Ward Seminary and Belmont College for Young Women merged in 1913 to form Ward- Belmont, the first junior college in the South to receive full accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Dr. John Diell Blanton was the first president of Ward- Belmont, he was previously the president of Ward Seminary since 1883. In 1914 an academic building was dedicated to Dr. Blanton, however it burned down in 1972. By the 1920s, it had an enrollment of more than 1,200 women. The Preparatory School was a four year secondary high school program. Entrance to the College and Conservatory of Music was for students who had completed high school. The College and Conservatory of Music were two-year junior college programs that prepared students for senior universities. To accommodate the large number of students, three new dormitory buildings were built: Pembroke (1913), Heron (1916), and Hail (1923). These dormitories are still in use at Belmont University. In 1951, under financial constraints, Ward-Belmont's campus was sold to the Tennessee Baptist Convention. The campus was used to establish Belmont College (now Belmont University). A new, modern, nonresidential girls' high school, Harpeth Hall School, was established on the Estes estate in the affluent Green Hills section of Nashville to take the place of Ward-Belmont. The original campus remained under the aegis of the Tennessee Baptist Convention until 2007, when Belmont University became independent of its control.  Social Activities  Club Village was a collection of ten houses that were made for Ward-Belmont's social clubs. The social clubs included Anti-Pandora, Twentieth Century, Del Vers, Tri K, Penta Tau, X. L., Osiron, Agora, A.K., and F.F. Each of the houses included a formal club room, kitchen, game room, and music room. At the start of the academic year, students would engage in a \\"rushing\\" period in which they would familiarize themselves with the different clubs. Every student who participated in this period was accepted into one of the clubs. May Day Festival was one of the outstanding social events of the spring. This marks the culmination of the Physical Education Program, in which every student participates. The grand parade, picturesque costumes of the dancers and the May Queen with her Court add a dramatic touch to the celebration which is viewed by several thousand friends, parents, and alumnae.

The initial batting order is a list of the nine position players selected by the manager to play that game, indicating the sequence in which they will bat and the position to which they have been assigned for the game. During the game, batters make a plate appearance in the order specified by the batting order, repeating the sequence once the ninth batter has made a plate appearance. Occasionally, one or more batters may bat in the incorrect order. In Major League Baseball, this violates rule 6.01(a) of the Official Baseball Rules. Batting out of turn is ignored by rule unless a member of the defensive team notifies the umpire that an infraction has occurred. Once the umpire is notified, he enforces the rule based on the batting order he had received. See Penalty section for the consequences of such notification. Determining the proper batter At any time, the proper batter is simply the player whose name follows the previous actual batter in the written batting order (at the start of the game, the #1 hitter is the proper batter, and in subsequent innings, the leadoff proper batter is the one who follows the last batter to complete a plate appearance in the last previous inning). Any batter's out-of-turn but completed plate appearance is legalized when a pitch is thrown to any subsequent batter on either team. Thus, in order to determine who is the proper batter at any given time, it is necessary only to consider the last two batters who have received a pitch‚Äîthe last proper or legalized batter and the batter whose action will be nullified if found improper. When an improper batter is legalized by a pitch to a subsequent batter, the written order does not change. The proper batter is then the next batter in the written order just after the newly legalized improper batter, even if this causes one or more batters to be skipped. (If the proper batter is on base‚Äîa situation that can happen due to his being a previous improper batter, now legalized‚Äîhe is skipped and the batting order goes to the next name on it.) Because the umpire and official scorer are not to comment on the batting order (outside of ruling on an appeal), the teams need to be vigilant about following the written order. Penalty If the umpire is notified of such an infraction immediately after a batter completes his appearance, then the umpire considers that batter and the previous one. If the batter who just finished batting does not follow the previous batter in the written order, his plate appearance was improper, any advances or scores due to his action are nullified, he is removed from the bases if he reached, and the proper batter is called out. If batting out of turn is appealed, the entire play is nullified under Official Baseball Rule 6.07 and MiLB Umpire Manual 4.3. Any runners who advanced on the play would be returned to the base they occupied at the time of the pitch. However, an advance on a stolen base or wild pitch is not a result of the batter's illegal action, and would stand. If the improper batter hits into a double play, in which he was put out as well as another runner, the defense can still appeal that he was the improper batter. If this is the case, the proper batter is declared out, the other runner called out on the double play is returned to the base he occupied at the time of the pitch, and the batter that follows the proper batter who was declared out will come to the plate. Under high school (NFHS) rules, any additional outs recorded on the play stand - the other out on the play would not be nullified, and the defense could still benefit from the double play. If the umpire is notified of such an infraction during a plate appearance (that is, a pitch has been thrown to the current batter, who has not yet been put out or become a runner), then the umpire considers the current batter and the previous one. If the current batter's name does not follow the previous actual batter's name in the written order, the current batter is improper. There is no penalty, but the situation is rectified ‚Äî the proper batter comes to bat and assumes the improper batter's current count. In this situation, if the proper batter is on base, then he is simply skipped in the order, and the next batter in the order is now the proper batter. In this situation under high school (NFHS) rules, the proper batter is brought in off the bases, assumes his proper at bat, and a courtesy runner (the last batted out) takes his place on the bases. Example situations Suppose the batting order is: Abel, Baker, Charles, Daniel, Edward, Frank, George, Hooker, Irwin. =Example: A proper batter fails to bat and is called out= Abel bats and is put out. Charles then bats out of turn. Charles makes a safe hit, reaching first base. Before any pitch is thrown to the next batter, a member of the defensive team asks the umpire to make a ruling. RULING: The proper batter after Abel was Baker, not Charles. Baker is called out for failing to bat in his turn, and Charles is removed from base and comes to bat again, because he is now the proper batter. For instance, on July 6, 2013, San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy submitted a lineup to the umpires with Gregor Blanco leading off, Marco Scutaro batting second, Pablo Sandoval batting third and Buster Posey hitting cleanup. After Blanco got on base and Scutaro made out, Posey improperly stepped to the plate and hit an RBI double to right field, scoring Blanco from third base. However, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Don Mattingly immediately appealed to plate umpire Tony Randazzo for a ruling and after discussion amongst the umpires, Sandoval was declared out for failing to bat in his turn, Blanco was sent back to 3rd base, and Posey, who was removed from the basepaths, came to bat again because he was now the proper batter. This time around, Posey flew out to end the inning, leaving Blanco stranded.\\"Rule 6.07: Batting Out of Order, Timely Appeal Cost Giants.\\" Close Call Sports and the Umpire Ejection Fantasy League. July 7, 2013. =Example: An improper batter is legalized= Abel bats and is put out. Charles then bats out of turn. Charles makes a safe hit, reaching first base. Baker then comes to bat. A strike is pitched to Baker. A member of the defensive team then asks the umpire to make a ruling regarding the improper batting order. RULING: The first pitch to Baker made Charles's turn legal. The proper batter after Charles is Daniel, not Baker. Without penalty, Daniel comes to bat (replacing Baker) and assumes that one-strike count. =Example: An improper batter causes an out after a previous improper batter was legalized= Abel bats and is put out. Edward then bats out of turn. Edward reaches first base, and Charles then comes to bat and reaches base. The infraction is discovered by the defensive manager before a pitch is thrown to any subsequent batter, and it is reported to the umpire at that time. RULING: Edward did bat out of turn, but the first pitch to Charles legalized Edward's plate appearance. Therefore, the proper batter after Edward is Frank, so Charles is removed from the bases, Edward is returned to first base, Frank is called out for failing to bat in his proper turn, and George is now the proper batter. =Example: The proper batter is skipped due to being on base= Suppose that Charles often bats second but was written as the third batter for this game. Abel bats and is put out. Charles then bats out of turn and makes a safe hit, reaching first base. Baker then bats out of turn and receives a base on balls, advancing Charles to second base. Edward then comes to bat and takes a strike. The defense then appeals to the umpire. RULING: The first pitch to Edward legalized Baker's turn at bat. The proper batter after Baker is Charles, but he is on base, so he is skipped in the order; thus Daniel is now the proper batter. Because Edward's plate appearance had not yet finished, there is no penalty; Daniel comes to bat (replacing Edward) and assumes the one strike Edward received. In this example, you will notice that the umpire ignores the fact that Charles previously batted out of turn. This underscores the principle that any pitch legalizes all previous turns at bat. Charles's turn at bat became legal when a pitch was thrown to Baker. The umpire needs to consider only Baker and Edward, the last two batters who have received a pitch. =Example: Substitutions and batting out of turn= When a substitute enters the game, he takes the written spot of the player whom he replaces. Suppose that George bats and is put out, then a pinch hitter, Stephen, comes to bat. Stephen (a) reports that he is batting for Irwin, or (b) doesn't report. Stephen hits safely and reaches first base. Hooker then comes to bat and hits safely, advancing Stephen. The defense appeals to the umpire that batter was out of turn. RULING: In (a), Stephen's name replaces Irwin in the batting order. The first pitch to Hooker legalized Stephen's turn at bat. The proper batter after Stephen is Abel. Thus Hooker is removed from the bases for being an improper batter; Stephen returns to first base; Abel is called out for failing to bat in turn, and the proper batter is now Baker. In (b), since Stephen did not report as a substitute, he legally enters the game in the place of the proper batter. Stephen's name thus replaces Hooker in the order, and Hooker is out of the game. Since Hooker was no longer in the game when he came to bat, he was an illegal substitute and not a batter out of turn. The penalty for this infraction is not related to batting out of turn; it is an illegal substitution.

The date heading reads: \\"From Tuesday September 1, O.S. to Saturday September 16, N.S. 1752\\". Old Style (O.S.) and New Style (N.S.) are terms sometimes used with dates to indicate that the calendar convention used at the time described is different from that in use at the time the document was being written. There were two calendar changes in Great Britain and its colonies, which may sometimes complicate matters: the first was to change the start of the year from Lady Day (25 March) to 1 January; the second was to discard the Julian calendar in favour of the Gregorian calendar.Death warrant of Charles I web page of the UK National Archives. A demonstration of New Style, meaning Julian calendar with a start of year adjustment.Stockton, J.R. Date Miscellany I: The Old and New Styles \\"The terms 'Old Style' and 'New Style' are now commonly used for both the 'Start of Year' and 'Leap Year' [(Gregorian calendar)] changes (England & Wales: both in 1752; Scotland: 1600, 1752). I believe that, properly and historically, the 'Styles' really refer only to the 'Start of Year' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the 'Leap Year' change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.\\"Spathaky, Mike Old Style and New Style Dates and the change to the Gregorian Calendar. \\"Before 1752, parish registers, in addition to a new year heading after 24th March showing, for example '1733', had another heading at the end of the following December indicating '1733/4'. This showed where the Historical Year 1734 started even though the Civil Year 1733 continued until 24th March. ... We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Civil or the Historical Year. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 OS (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6. The hyphen (1745-6) is best avoided as it can be interpreted as indicating a period of time.\\" Closely related is the custom of dual dating, where writers gave two consecutive years to reflect differences in the starting date of the year, or to include both the Julian and Gregorian dates. Beginning in 1582, the Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian in Roman Catholic countries. This change was implemented subsequently in Protestant and Orthodox countries, usually at much later dates. In England and Wales, Ireland, and the British colonies, the change to the start of the year and the changeover from the Julian calendar occurred in 1752 under the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750. In Scotland, the legal start of the year had already been moved to 1 January (in 1600), but Scotland otherwise continued to use the Julian calendar until 1752. Thus \\"New Style\\" can either refer to the start of year adjustment, or to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar. In Russia, new style dates came into use in early 1918. Other countries in Eastern Orthodoxy adopted new style dating for their civil calendars but most continue to use the Julian calendar for religious use. In English-language histories of other countries (especially Russia), the Anglophone OS/NS convention is often used to identify which calendar is being used when giving a date. Start of the year in the historical records of Britain and its colonies and possessions Memorial plaque to John Etty in All Saints' Church, North Street, York, recording his date of death as 28 January When recording British history it is usual to use the dates recorded at the time of the event, with the year adjusted to start on 1 January; but the start of the Julian year was not always 1 January and was altered at different times in different countries. See New Year's Day in the Julian calendar. From 1155 to 1752, the civil or legal year in England began on 25 March (Lady Day)N√∏rby, Toke. The Perpetual Calendar: What about England? Version 29 February 2000.; so for example, the execution of Charles I was recorded at the time in Parliament as happening on 30 January 1648 (Old Style). In newer English language texts this date is usually shown as \\"30 January 1649\\" (New Style). The corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar is 9 February 1649, the date by which his contemporaries in some parts of continental Europe would have recorded his execution. The O.S./N.S. designation is particularly relevant for dates which fall between the start of the \\"historical year\\" (1 January) and the official start date, where different. This was 25 March in England, Wales and the colonies until 1752. During the years between the first introduction of the Gregorian calendar in continental Europe and its introduction in Britain, contemporary usage in England started to change. In Britain, 1 January was celebrated as the New Year festival,Tuesday 31 December 1661, Pepys Diary \\"I sat down to end my journell for this year, ..\\" but the \\"year starting 25th March was called the Civil or Legal Year, although the phrase Old Style was more commonly used.\\" To reduce misunderstandings about the date, it was normal in parish registers to place a new year heading after 24 March (for example \\"1661\\") and another heading at the end of the following December, 1661/62, a form of dual dating to indicate that in the following few weeks the year was 1661 Old Style but 1662 New Style.Spathaky, Mike Old Style and New Style Dates and the change to the Gregorian Calendar. \\"An oblique stroke is by far the most usual indicator, but sometimes the alternative final figures of the year are written above and below a horizontal line, as in a fraction, thus: 17\\\\tfrac{33}{34}. Very occasionally a hyphen is used, as 1733-34.\\" Some more modern sources, often more academic ones (e.g. the History of Parliament) also use the 1661/62 style for the period between 1 January and 25 March for years before the introduction of the New Style calendar in England.See for example this biographical entry: Scotland had already partly made the change: its calendar year had begun on 1 January since 1600. Adoption of the Gregorian calendar William Hogarth painting: Humours of an Election (c. 1755), which is the main source for \\"Give us our Eleven Days\\". Through the enactment of the British Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 and of the Irish Parliament's Calendar (New Style) Act, 1750, Great Britain, Ireland and the British Empire (including much of what is now the eastern part of the United States) adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752, by which time it was necessary to correct by 11 days. Wednesday, 2 September 1752, was followed by Thursday, 14 September 1752. Claims that rioters demanded \\"Give us our eleven days\\" grew out of a misinterpretation of a painting by William Hogarth.. The British tax year traditionally began on Lady Day (25 March) on the Julian calendar and this became 5 April, which was the \\"New Style\\" equivalent. A 12th skipped Julian leap day in 1800 changed its start to 6 April. It was not changed when a 13th Julian leap day was skipped in 1900, so the tax year in the United Kingdom still begins on 6 April. =Adoption in the Americas= The European colonies of the Americas adopted the new style calendar when their mother countries did. In what is now the continental United States, the French and Spanish possessions did so before the British colonies. In Alaska, the change took place after the United States purchased Alaska from Russia. Friday, 6 October 1867 was followed by Friday, 18 October. Instead of 12 days, only 11 were skipped, and the day of the week was repeated on successive days, because at the same time the International Date Line was moved, from following Alaska's eastern border with Canada to following its new western border, now with Russia. Anglophone usage describing events in other countries It is common in English-language publications to use the familiar Old Style and/or New Style terms to discuss events and personalities in other countries, especially with reference to the Russian Empire and the very beginning of Soviet Russia. For example, in the article \\"The October (November) Revolution,\\" the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica uses the format of \\"25 October (7 November, New Style)\\" to describe the date of the start of the revolution. When that usage is encountered, the British adoption date is not necessarily intended. The 'start of year' change and the calendar system change were not always adopted concurrently. Similarly, civil and religious adoption may not have happened at the same time or even at all. In the case of Eastern Europe, for example, all of those assumptions would be incorrect. Transposition of historical event dates and possible date conflicts Thomas Jefferson's tombstone. Written below the epitaph is \\"Born April 2 1743 O.S. Died July 4 1826\\" Usually, the mapping of New Style dates onto Old Style dates with a start of year adjustment works well with little confusion for events before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. For example, the Battle of Agincourt is well known to have been fought on 25 October 1415, which is Saint Crispin's Day. However, for the period between the first introduction of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582 and its introduction in Britain on 14 September 1752, there can be considerable confusion between events in Continental Western Europe and in British domains. Events in Continental Western Europe are usually reported in English-language histories by using the Gregorian calendar. For example, the Battle of Blenheim is always given as 13 August 1704. However, confusion occurs when an event involves both. For example, William III of England arrived at Brixham in England on 5 November (Julian calendar), after he had set sail from the Netherlands on 11 November (Gregorian calendar) 1688.. The Battle of the Boyne in Ireland took place a few months later on 1 July 1690 (Julian calendar). That maps to 11 July (Gregorian calendar), conveniently close to the Julian date of the subsequent (and more decisive) Battle of Aughrim on 12 July 1691 (Julian). The latter battle was commemorated annually throughout the 18th century on 12 July, following the usual historical convention of commemorating events of that period within Great Britain and Ireland by mapping the Julian date directly onto the modern Gregorian calendar date (as happens, for example, with Guy Fawkes Night on 5 November). The Battle of the Boyne was commemorated with smaller parades on 1 July. However, both events were combined in the late 18th century, and continue to be celebrated as \\"The Twelfth\\". Because of the differences, British writers and their correspondents often employed two dates, which is called dual dating, more or less automatically. Letters concerning diplomacy and international trade thus sometimes bore both Julian and Gregorian dates to prevent confusion. For example, Sir William Boswell wrote to Sir John Coke from The Hague a letter dated \\"12/22 Dec. 1635\\". In his biography of John Dee, The Queen's Conjurer, Benjamin Woolley surmises that because Dee fought unsuccessfully for England to embrace the 1583/84 date set for the change, \\"England remained outside the Gregorian system for a further 170 years, communications during that period customarily carrying two dates\\".) uses the quote by Benjamin Woolley and cites The Queen's Conjurer, The Science and Magic of Dr. John Dee, Adviser to Queen Elizabeth I, page 173. In contrast, Thomas Jefferson, who lived while the British Isles and colonies eventually converted to the Gregorian calendar, instructed that his tombstone bear his date of birth by using the Julian calendar (notated O.S. for Old Style) and his date of death by using the Gregorian calendar. At Jefferson's birth, the difference was eleven days between the Julian and Gregorian calendars and so his birthday of 2 April in the Julian calendar is 13 April in the Gregorian calendar. Similarly, George Washington is now officially reported as having been born on 22 February 1732, rather than on 11 February 1731/32 (Julian calendar). (Both Franklin's and Washington's confusing birth dates are clearly explained.) There is some evidence that the calendar change was not easily accepted. Many British people continued to celebrate their holidays \\"Old Style\\" well into the 19th century, a practice that the author Karen Bellenir considered to reveal a deep emotional resistance to calendar reform. Differences between Julian and Gregorian dates The change arose from the realisation that the correct figure for the number of days in a year is not 365.25 (365 days 6 hours) as assumed by the Julian calendar but slightly less (c. 365.242 days): the Julian calendar has too many leap years. The consequence was that the basis for calculation of the date of Easter as decided in the 4th century had drifted from reality. The Gregorian calendar reform also dealt with the accumulated difference between these figures, between the years 325 and 1582 (1752 in the British Empire), by skipping 10 days (11 in the case of Great Britain, including its colonies and Ireland) to restore the date of the vernal equinox to approximately 21 March, the approximate date it occurred at the time of the First Council of Nicea in 325.

Plot Two generals, Macbett and Banco, put down a rebellion. In payment for their heroic service, Archduke Duncan promises to bestow on them land, titles and cash, but he reneges on the deal. Encouraged by the seductive Lady Duncan, Macbett plots to assassinate the Archduke and crown himself King. He tries to maintain his tenuous grip on the throne through a vicious cycle of murder and bloodshed. Meanwhile, he is haunted by the ghosts of his victims and discovers that his new wife is not all that she seems. Themes Written during the Cold War, Ionesco's Macbett remoulds Shakespeare's Macbeth into a comic tale of ambition, corruption, cowardice and excess, creating a tragic farce which takes human folly to its wildest extremes. Innovations include a long conversation between the thanes of Glamiss and Candor, the characters a lemonade seller and butterfly hunter, and the revelation that the rightful heir to the throne is a worse tyrant than Macbett ever was.

Early army career Cox was born and later worked as a farm labourer in the Hertfordshire village of Kings Langley. He married Maud Swan in 1912 and had one son when war was declared, but still volunteered in September 1914. He was a private in the 7th Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment. He went to France in July 1915 and spent nearly two years in the trenches, first on the Somme near Albert. He was wounded on the first day of the Somme offensive. He was at Thiepval in September 1916 and participated in the Bihucourt assault in March 1917, an engagement in which his actions would earn him the Victoria Cross. Victoria Cross On 13 March 1917 at Achiet-le- Grand, France, during an attack by the battalion, the front wave was checked by very heavy artillery and machine gun fire and the whole line had to take cover in shell holes. Cox, a stretcher-bearer, went out over fire-swept ground and single-handedly rescued four men. Having collected the wounded of his own battalion he then helped to bring in the wounded of the adjoining battalion. On two subsequent days he carried out similar work with complete disregard for his own safety. Injury and later life He sustained serious wounds to his foot in an attack on the village of Cherisy on 3 May 1917 which resulted in him being sent back to England, after which he helped to train recruits. Cox was presented with the Victoria Cross by King George V on 21 July 1917 at Buckingham Palace. After the war, he refused the offer of a commission and a house and began work as a builder in Kings Langley, later being employed at the nearby Ovaltine factory. During the Second World War, he joined the local Home Guard. His family expanded to eight children and 14 grandchildren. He died on 28 April 1959 at the age of 69. His Victoria Cross is currently on display at the Imperial War Museum, London, England. Memorial celebration in 2007 On 9 September 2007 Kings Langley village celebrated Christopher Augustus Cox's life and daring deeds in a village ceremony. The High Street was closed to traffic to allow a pipe band, standard bearers, ex-service men and women, local dignitaries and members of the Cox family to parade from the Kings Langley Methodist Church along the High Street to the Parish Church for a memorial service. The Last Post played by bugle was sounded within the Church and by the grave. The congregation then moved to the community centre, where artifacts relating to Christopher Cox's life were on display. Kings Langley village was twinned with Achiet-le-Grand in France in November 2009, in honour of Christopher Cox.

Gameplay The player controls a scuba diver who must protect a treasure from an octopus at the top of the screen: The octopus tries to capture the treasure with its tentacles. Meanwhile, a great white shark tries to distract the diver by swimming back and forth toward the bottom of the screen. The diver loses a life if he is captured by the shark or the octopus's tentacles, or if the air meter runs out. The diver can refill his air meter by touching a long pole which extends from a boat that appears from time to time. History The game was conceived by Rob Dubren in February 1982. He offered it to Parker Bros., who owned the video game license for Jaws at the time. After Parker Bros. lost the license, the game was shown to Jim Wickstead of James Wickstead Design Associates, who programmed it from August to October 1982. Originally developed as Treasures of the Deep, the game was picked up by U.S. Games as Guardians of Treasure. U.S. Games decided to create a contest around the game, releasing it as Name This Game and Win $10,000 with a cash prize to be awarded to the winning name after April 30, 1983. However, before the contest was completed, U.S. Games ceased operation. Carrere Video Distribution released the game in Europe as Octopus. Amiga also planned to include the game in its Power Play Arcade #2 cartridge under the name Galleon's Gold, but development did not proceed past the prototype stage. Legacy In 1994, Digital Press held its own naming contest for the game. The winning title, coined by Russ Perry Jr., was Going Under, which alluded not only to the game content, but to the final days of its publisher.

Kling was the Cubs' starting catcher in the final game of the 1908 World Series, the last championship for the team for 108 years. Early years Kling was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of John (a German-American baker) and Caroline Kling. It was expected that he would work in the bakery business, as his brother Charles seems to have done, but Johnny fell in love with baseball. By the age of fifteen, he was playing amateur ball. He also had an interest in pool, and began playing competitively even as he pursued a baseball career (\\"Match Game of Pool\\", 1897, 3). In late January 1904, Kling married Lillian May Gradwohl. While Kling was not born Jewish, his wife was, and they were married by a Kansas City Rabbi Harry H. Mayer, of Temple B'nai Jehudah, a Reform congregation. In the major leagues After playing amateur and semi-pro baseball, Kling finally made his major league debut on September 11, 1900, playing for the Chicago Orphans of the National League. He got three hits, and made a positive impression both as a catcher and as a hitter. For what was left of the season, he caught fifteen games and had a batting average of .294Simon, 2004, 95 He also acquired the nickname \\"Noisy John\\", because he kept up a constant chatter on the field; some baseball historians have noted this was part of his skill in waging \\"psychological warfare\\" on his opponents. By all accounts he was an exceptional defensive catcher, praised for his skill in throwing out runners who were caught stealing. He was also a reliable hitter, and a pivotal member of the team that became known as the Chicago Cubs, an integral part of the dynasty which included Hall of Fame infielders Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers and Frank Chance. Between 1906 and 1910, the Cubs won four National League pennants and two World Series titles, and Kling was said to be one of the reasons why. And unlike many ballplayers of his day, he didn't smoke, drink or chew tobacco. Staying in good shape as a result was said to contribute to his baseball success.\\"Brought Kling Back\\", 1910, S3 Overall, he played in 1261 major league games, hit .272 with 20 home runs and 514 RBIs in his major league career. He had 1154 hits in 4246 at bats and scored 475 runs. In August 1902, he amassed a Major League Baseball record streak of 12 consecutive hits. Walt Dropo later tied the mark in 1952. He caught 115 shutouts during his career, ranking him 16th all-time among major league catchers. Pool vs. Baseball While he loved baseball, Kling never lost his devotion to the game of pool. In 1902, for example, one reporter called him the best pool player of any active baseball player.\\"Baseball Notes\\", 1902, 36 He often played for purses as high as $300, a sizable amount in that era. During this time, he also ran his own billiard room in his native Kansas City.\\"Crack John Kling Will Play Walsh\\", 1903, 12 During the early 1900s, his pool-playing career was regarded positively by sports reporters‚Äîin one article, he was praised as a baseball player who was not idle during the off-season; he was said to have \\"double[d] his diamond income\\" by being an accomplished pool player.\\"Baseball Gossip\\", 1904, E1 His skill at pool also served him well when it came time to negotiate his baseball salary. Before the 1906 season he announced that he would not sign a new contract unless Chicago offered him a raise in pay, and if the raise was not forthcoming he would stay home and play pool. This angered his manager, Frank Chance, who snapped that everyone else but Kling had come to terms with the club.\\"Catcher Kling Refuses to Sign\\", 1906, 10 He subsequently did decide to play, raise or not. He had another impressive season, catching 96 games and hitting over .300 for the record 116-36 pennant winners.Spink, 1911, 104 Although he once again told Cubs' management he was considering giving up baseball for pool before the 1907 season,\\"Kling Sticks to Billiards\\", 1907, 10 he once again returned to play for the Cubs, who won the World Series in both 1907 and 1908. Then, in early 1909, after several solid years with Chicago, he engaged in another dispute with the management over salary and this time decided to spend some time away from the club.\\"Given Leave of Absence\\", 1909, 5 During that time he continued to compete in pool, winning the world billiards championship, and played semi-pro baseball with a Kansas City team. He sat out the entire 1909 season, and in early October competed against Charles \\"Cowboy\\" Weston and won the world's championship of pool.\\"Johnny Kling, Pool Champion\\", 1909, 10 When he decided to come back to baseball in early 1910 and asked to be reinstated, a debate ensued as to whether he should be permitted to return since he had not honored his contract during the 1909 season. National League President Thomas J. Lynch wanted him fined or possibly traded; in the end, he was fined $700 and allowed to return.\\"Kling Readmitted to Fold\\", 1910, 8 His love for both pool and billiards led him to not only play competitively, but to organize a league which was called the National Amateur Three-Cushion League. It had teams from eight cities, Kansas City, Chicago and St. Louis among them.\\"Billiard League Organized by Kling\\", 1910, D6 He told reporters that when his baseball career was over, he would devote himself to pool and billiards full-time.\\"Baseball as Business Training\\", 1911, M4 And despite his often-divided loyalties, baseball writers agreed that Kling was among the best players of his era; in fact, his obituary described him as \\"one of the greatest catchers the Chicago Cubs ever had\\".\\"Johnny Kling Dead\\", 1947, 15 Final years After a decade of success with the Cubs, Kling was traded to the lowly Boston Braves, where he spent the 1911 and 1912 seasons. At one point he even managed the Braves, but his managerial efforts were not successful and the team had a losing record He was said to be unhappy with the way the Braves' owners made him run the team, and this led to his being traded in 1913.\\"J. Kling May Quit Bostons\\", 1912, 6 His final year in the majors was spent with the Cincinnati Reds. He devoted the rest of his life to several important pursuits. He owned the Dixon Hotel in Kansas City, where his billiard parlor gained national recognition. During his baseball career, he had begun mentoring his nephew, Bennie Allen, and as the years passed, Bennie went on to become a champion too.\\"How Johnny Kling Found Out His Nephew Was a Coming Champion\\", 1908, 3S In 1933, he purchased the Kansas City Blues of the American Association and was able to generate more interest in the team and increase their attendance within a year of taking over.\\"Kling Wearing Happy Grin as Turnstyles Move\\", 1935, 16 One of his innovations was to desegregate the ballpark, allowing both black and white fans to attend the games together. Kling sold the Blues in 1937. Though never a major name among Hall of Fame rooters, Kling garnered his share of support for Cooperstown. He received votes from the BBWAA in eight elections, earning as much as 10% of the vote (in 1937). In late January 1947, while returning from Miami to Kansas City, he suffered either a heart attack or a cerebral hemorrhage and died in the hospital at age 71. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.\\"Ex-Cub Catcher Dead\\", 1947, 14\\"John Kling Dead, Ex-Catcher for Cubs\\", 1947, p. 15 Was Kling Jewish? Speculation about whether Kling was Jewish has persisted over the years. One source says he used the name \\"Kline\\" early in his career,\\"Birthday Greetings\\", 1912, 12 a surname that is sometimes (but not always) Jewish. And although he was married to a Jewish woman in a ceremony conducted by a Reform Jewish rabbi, there are questions that have never been fully resolved. The major Jewish newspapers never questioned Kling's Jewishness: writers and reporters frequently referred to him as Jewish, in articles from the 1920s through the 1970s. The Boston Jewish Advocate was among those that asserted his real name was John Kline, and said he had even played baseball under that name; one writer said he was \\"the first of the Jewish [baseball] pioneers\\" (Harold U. Ribalow, \\"Johnny Kling Showed the Way\\", Jewish Advocate, 12 April 1951, p. 22). But even earlier, the story of Kling's Jewishness was given a vote of confidence by New York Giants owner-manager John McGraw, who knew Kling and referred to him as a Jewish ballplayer in a 1923 article, \\"Jewish Baseball Players Wanted\\" (American Israelite, 9 August 1923, p. 6). Among contemporary authors who believe he was Jewish is Dr. Gil Bogen, who wrote a book about Kling's life. But some researchers dispute this, and years after his death, his widow Lillian, who was definitely Jewish, seemed to deny that her husband was ever Jewish.Al Yellon, http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2006/12/16/55453/749 In a 1976 Esquire magazine article, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \\"All Time All-Star Argument Starter\\", consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. Kling was the catcher on Stein's Jewish team. (A reader, however, wrote in and pointed out that Kling was not Jewish but his wife was; and suggested Harry Danning instead.)

Lepage and broadcast on Radio-Canada, as well as the title of its French adaptation on France 2. It was one of the most successful television shows in the province of Quebec, with a concept exported to more than thirty markets around the world.\\"Distraction Ramps Up U.S. Activities\\", WorldScreen.com, August 25, 2006, retrieved August 29, 2006 It was the first French-language Canadian television programme to be adapted in the United States (see below). The show spawned several international versions, most notably a French TV series of the same name, which characters appeared in a 1999 episode of the original series, \\"√Ä Paris\\". Overview A typical episode features several vignettes of the everyday life of a couple, with the camera mostly centred on them. Often other characters are cropped, giving the programme its unique visual style. The couple receives friends for supper, go to the convenience store, or leave on a trip, and sometimes get on each other's nerves. Their quirks, and loving bickering, provide much of the program's humour. The graphic design style associated with the original Un gars, une fille, which consists of a palette of pastel blue and pink, and rough lines and scribbles, (seen in the transition graphics, see Original section), as well as a logo with simulated printing mistakes and smears, has been imitated by most of the other versions, with the notable exception of the American version. The character names are often those of the actors, as in the first version. Original The concept of Un gars, une fille began in the 1990s as a series of short segments featured on Besoin d'amour, a TQS network daily talk-show, hosted by Guy A. Lepage that ran from 1995 to 1996. Lepage, a veteran of the renowned comedy troupe Rock et Belles Oreilles (RBO), played one half of the couple along with Sylvie L√©onard. The duo reprised their roles in what became Un gars une fille in 1997, a successful weekly 26-minute programme which spawned many adaptations. It was celebrated numerous times at awards presentations, notably winning the G√©meaux, F√©lix, and MetroStar Awards. It was also nominated twice at the American Emmy Awards. Produced by Avanti Cin√© Vid√©o, the show aired from 1997 to 2003 in its initial run, and continued in reruns afterward. 130 episodes were produced, which included about 4,000 scenes.\\"Un gars une fille dernier √©pisode canadien\\" by Arthur Anthamatten, Toutelatele.com, March 31, 2003, retrieved September 16, 2006 The scriptwriting team included RBO members Andr√© Ducharme and Bruno Landry, as well as Sylvie L√©onard herself. Yves P. Pelletier, also from RBO, has been featured onscreen. After the series concluded in 2003, Lepage went on to produce and host the hugely successful Tout le monde en parle, adapted from the eponymous French hit talk-show. A typical visual style of many adaptations: a medium shot of the couple facing cropped-out secondary characters. A standard episode is presented in three acts, each of which is split into five to seven scenes. Flashy pastel blue and pink graphics with squiggly lines follow punchlines and mark transitions, coupled with an upbeat percussive tune, and often a spoken Voice-over phrase summing up the previous segment. Appropriately, the show's publicity, and early video release covers, are often recognisable by the presence of those pastel blue and pink colours and askew lines, mimicking the graphics that separate the programme's scenes; traditionally, the colour blue is associated with boys and pink with girls. The two main characters, \\"Guy et Sylvie\\", are named after the actors who play them. Guy likes to tease Sylvie on a variety of subjects and hates her mother. His father is remarried to a young, good-looking stripper, M√©lanie, played by Mah√©e Paiement, and had a child with her. The attention the child receives makes Guy jealous, his father having spent little time with him when he was a child. Unlike Guy, Sylvie dreams of having a baby. She is jealous of Genevi√®ve, Guy's sexy, and promiscuous, office colleague with whom he had a one-time affair years ago. She is also obsessed with cleanliness and resents Guy for being untidy. A curious running gag from the show involves Guy surprising Sylvie by grabbing her breasts from behind while shouting \\"Road Runner!\\", followed by the cartoon character's emblematic honking \\"beeb beeb\\" sound. While she ostensibly loves it, she pretended the exact opposite when it was obliquely brought up by Guy in front of her mother.Episode #37, Un gars, une fille This joke was developed on the set by the two actors.Supplements, Un gars, une fille DVD #5 The last season saw notable developments: a marriage, and a trip to Vietnam to adopt a little girl. Adaptations =Bulgaria= The Bulgarian version, known as –¢—è –∏ —Ç–æ–π (She and He) aired from 2002 to 2005 on bTV. In 2007, the show moved to Foxlife and the fourth season began airing. The show was cancelled after the final (25th) episode of the season, ending with a cliffhanger. 96 episodes were produced during the show's Bulgarian run. Since then reruns are airing on Foxlife and bTV Comedy. Stefaniya Koleva stars as Sylvia, and Julian Vergov plays Martin. =Canada (English version)= The rights for an English Canadian adaptation are held by the producer of the original show Luc Wiseman of Avanti Cin√©-Vid√©o television production company. The main English Canadian networks CBC, CTV, and Global Television were not interested in the concept. Wiseman stated: \\"They were saying that it was not for the Canadian market, that it was too audacious\\". With the title A Guy & A Girl, it ended up airing on Women's Television Network (WTN), (now known as the W Network), a cable television specialty channel, and lasted for two seasons.\\"Un gars, une fille, made in the USA\\" by Hugo Dumas, La Presse, August 29, 2006, retrieved September 11, 2006 Jeff Clarke played Mike, and Kate Ashby was Susy. =Cyprus= ŒïŒ≥œé Œ∫Œπ ŒµœÉœç (Me and You) began airing in October 2010 on CyBC1, the Cyprus' public broadcaster's main television channel, and on the CyBC Video on Demand platform, in the format of one 35-minute episode each week. Following the original concept, it kept the actors' actual names: Marios is the guy (played by Marios Mettis) and Niovi is the girl (played by Niovi Haralambus). In the other half of the season Fotis is the guy (played by Fotis Georgidis) and Danae is the girl (played by Danae Christou). =France= The characteristic unstable line and smudge graphics at the beginning and end of the show, and in the middle of two scenes. =Greece= Œ£' Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄœé Œº' Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ¨œÇ (S'agapo M'agapas (I love you, You love me)) began broadcasting in Greece in 2000. Its format is weekly, 26-minute episodes, much like the original. Thodoris Atheridis plays Thodoris, the guy, and Dimitra Papadopoulou plays Dimitra, the girl, replicating the original version's concept of using the actors' first names for the characters. =Hungary= The Hungarian version of Un gars, une fille was called Szeret, nem szeret. It began airing in 2002 on TV2. According to IMDB, the format is 7-minute segments, much like in France. The guy is Br√∫n√≥, played by Szab√≥ Gy≈ëz≈ë and the girl is Brigi, played by Oroszl√°n Szonja. =Italy= The first Italian version of the programme was called Love Bugs, which is the international marketing name of Un gars, une fille. It ran on Italia 1 from 2004 to 2005 with the couple played by comedian Fabio De Luigi (already well known for his collaboration with Gialappa's Band) and Michelle Hunziker, a veteran of Zelig Circus. A second season, Love Bugs 2 aired from 2005 to 2006 with Elisabetta Canalis replacing Hunziker. The characters' names in both series are those of the actors, in the fashion of the original show. In the third season in 2007, Love Bugs 3, the couple was played by Emilio Solfrizzi and Giorgia Surina (MTV's Veejay). Because of low ratings, Love Bugs 3 was cancelled. Nevertheless, approximately 50 episodes of the third season were filmed and broadcast, much the same as the previous two seasons. =North Macedonia= The Macedonian version of \\"Un gars, une fille\\" is known under the name of –°–∞—à–æ –∏ –°–∞—à–∫–∞ (Sasho & Sashka). It stars Biljana Dragicevik-Projkovska as Sashka, the girl, and Zoran Ljutkov as Sasho, the guy. It was broadcast in 2005-2006 on Macedonian Radio Television . =Poland= In Poland, Kasia i Tomek began broadcast on September 3, 2002 on the TVN network. The title refers to the first names of the characters, the Polish equivalents of the English \\"Kate\\" and \\"Tom\\". It starred Joanna Brodzik as Kasia, the girl, and Pawe≈Ç Wilczak as Tomek, the guy. It won two Telekamery awards in 2002: one for best comedy series and one for Brodzik for best actress.

The first season finished in June 2009 with 36 episodes that were aired on the TurkMax channel during Thursday prime-time, with each episode running approximately 27 to 28 minutes in length. Despite the series airing on a specialty channel, on a satellite network - Digiturk - that requires a subscription, its popularity among young viewers is increasing steadily thanks to viral marketing and the sharing of clips on YouTube and Facebook. In January 2012 the show was renamed 1 Erkek 1 Kadƒ±n (\\"One Man One Woman\\") and new episodes aired on Star TV =Ukraine= The Ukrainian version of Un gars, une fille called Lesya + Roma (–õ–µ—Å—è + –†–æ–º–∞) began broadcasting in 2005 on ICTV.

It aired on the TBS cable television network on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays sometime in the slot between 11:00 pm and midnight, and on Friday morning in the slot between 9:00 am and 10:00 am. Lovebites stars David Julian Hirsh (a native of Montreal, Quebec, seen in CSI: NY and Naked Josh) and Lauren Bittner (seen in Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Third Watch). The characters, called Max and Katie, are about 25 years old, younger than the original Guy and Sylvie. Another notable difference with the original version is that the couple in Lovebites breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the camera. Lovebites was the first time a Qu√©b√©cois TV concept was adapted for an American audience (Louis 19, King of the Airwaves (Louis 19, le roi des ondes), a movie, had already been remade as EdTV). Reiser is said to have been captivated by the series when it was presented to him by Michel Rodrigue, president of Distraction Formats, the Montreal-based international distribution company for Un gars, une fille.\\"Love Bites: Un gars, une fille d√©barque aux Etats-Unis\\", Toutelatele.com, September 6, 2006, retrieved September 11, 2006 Rodrigue said: \\"The selling process has been long and complicated. It has been a very long time that we have been working on it\\". Creator Guy A. Lepage said that he thought the chemistry worked well between the two main actors. Nevertheless, he has stated his disappointment with the finished product, giving it a \\"2 out of 10\\". In his opinion, the problem did not lie with the acting, but with the length of the show (two and a half minutes long, as mentioned above), the sponsor, the broadcasting and the assembling. He summed it up by saying: \\"It's media concentration to the power of 1,000, like a super big TVA\\".\\"Guy A.

As of 2006, Canadian and American producers are still caught up in a legal dispute, notably about the aforementioned short length.

The German blazon does not specify how many bunches of grapes or leaves (if indeed any) there are to be, however. The chief with its grapevine, of course, expresses the importance of winegrowing in Udenheim, which indeed is an important business throughout Rhenish Hesse. The field is charged with elements taken from two noble families‚Äô coats of arms. These former nobles were the Lords of Udenheim (the bend, that is, diagonal stripe, in this case charged with chevrons), whose kinsman Peter von Udenheim was enfeoffed with the village by Count Heinrich II von Sponheim in 1380, and the family K√∂th von Wannscheid, who lived in the area, and whose kinsman Johann Friedrich von K√∂th was buried in the Udenheim church in 1590. In 1956, a different, but nonetheless rather similar-looking coat of arms was proposed for Udenheim. It had no chief (the band at the top of the escutcheon), but otherwise the charges and tinctures were the same as in the arms eventually adopted, with one small exception: There was only one eagle; there was none in base, and the bend simply had an empty blue field underneath.Description and explanation of Udenheim‚Äôs arms  Culture and sightseeing = Buildings = Since 1874, a belltower has stood in the middle of the village that was built for a foreseen church that was itself never built.

Plot Machizo Sakaida's father is a successful manga artist. Machizo feels he's living under his father's shadow, and resents his father's success. Machizo recently transferred to Tetsuo's school. Tetsuo's friends start Tetsuo on reading Oretachi no Banka, a manga by Machizo's father, Daiz≈ç Sakai. A manga competition advertised in the magazine sets Tetsuo on redrawing manga, hoping to win some money to help pay his mother's hospitalization fees. Tetsuo's initial efforts are ruined by Machizo. Kumiko, a ruthless girl who adored Tetsuo, threatened Machizo to repay Tetsuo. Machizo's novel writing efforts were recognized by Tetsuo, and they end up working together to create a manga. In the meantime, it is revealed that Tetsuo's father had returned and was trying to end the publication of Oretachi no Banka. It is also revealed that a manga written by Tetsuo had caused his mother to fall ill, and that Daiz≈ç took possession of the aforementioned manga. Daiz≈ç describes his motivation as trying his best so that one day Tetsuo would return to creating manga. Machizo and Tetsuo's manga is completed in the nick of time, with Machizo writing the story and Tetsuo drawing the graphics. Kumiko also advises Machizo on the plot details.

Daiz≈ç, as a judge of the competition, went up to present the prize to Tetsuo and Machizo, and remembering Tetsuo as his inspiration, hugged him before even realizing that Machizo was on stage as well. Tetsuo's father puts another handicap on both of them: they could not enter any collaborative works for the next competition, but had to create their own work. The death of Tetsuo's mother allows him freedom to create manga, and he begins to work on manga obsessively.

He went to Yukon in 1898 during the Gold Rush and prospected for gold, making a fortune and losing it when his claim was swept away in a flood. He then established a law practice in Dawson City. He was elected to the Yukon Territorial Council in 1905, and first ran for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1908 federal election but was defeated. In the 1911 federal election he was H.H. Stevens' campaign manager, and was rewarded by the government of Robert Laird Borden by being appointed to the position of Commissioner of the Yukon. As Commissioner from 1912 to 1915, he tried to bring in legislation to protect miners, loggers and others who worked for companies that went bankrupt. During World War I, Black recruited a regiment from the Yukon to fight in the war. He became the company's Captain, and was wounded in combat. Following the war, he settled in British Columbia in 1919, and ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. He first won a seat in Parliament in the 1921 election as a Conservative, representing Yukon. As a Member of Parliament (MP), he introduced legislation to give Yukoners the right to trial by jury and to protect mining titles. After the Tories won the 1930 election, the new Prime Minister of Canada, R.B. Bennett, nominated Black to be Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada. As Speaker, he kept a .22 caliber pistol in his chambers which he used to shoot rabbits on Parliament Hill. Black's personal and financial life were strained during the Great Depression and he had a nervous breakdown. He was committed to the Westminster Veterans Hospital in London, Ontario for 6 months. Being unavailable to preside over the final session of the 17th Parliament, he resigned prior to its commencement in January 1935. Since Black was unfit to run in the 1935 election his wife, Martha Black, ran in his place as an \\"Independent Conservative\\". She held the seat, becoming the second woman elected to the House of Commons (the first being Agnes Macphail), and the first American-born woman to do so. Black was released from hospital in July 1935, and moved to Vancouver to recuperate. Martha stepped aside, and allowed Black to run for the Yukon seat in the 1940 election. In the 1945 election the Liberal riding association was concerned that Communist union organizer Tom McEwen of the Labor-Progressive Party could win the election and opted not to run a candidate in Yukon riding and instead supported Black against the Communists and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. The local unions supported McEwen and the LPP's platform of support for collective bargaining, family allowance, old age pensions, workers‚Äô compensation and equality for \\"Indians and Eskimos.\\" Black campaigned on a more left wing platform, promising collective bargaining, minimum wages, maximum-hour and minimum-age laws, paid holidays, unemployment insurance and labour representation on government boards and defeated McEwan by a margin of 162 votes.History of Federal Ridings - YUKON (1945/06/11) He remained in Parliament until the 1949 election, which he did not contest.

Cond√© destroyed part of the Royalist army but failed to exploit his victory, retreating to Paris. Turenne regrouped and laid siege to the rebels at √âtampes. During the first four months of 1652, Cond√©'s attempts to conquer Aquitaine were thwarted by royalist troops led by the Count of Harcourt. Upon receiving intelligence that the royal court was travelling toward Paris, Cond√© left the southwest along with his supporters, among them La Rochefoucauld. On the first of April, he was reinforced at Lorris by troops led by the Duke of Nemours and the force that Gaston of Orleans had given command of to the Duke of Beaufort. Orleans and Beaufort, despite being brothers in law, got along poorly. Therefore, Cond√© took command of the combined rebel army. The royal army's disposition was as such: the court was at Gien, Turenne was at Briare, while Marshall Charles de Monchy d'Hocquincourt had imprudently advanced his forces to the village of Bl√©neau. There, he quartered his troops. Cond√© ambushed the Marshall's soldiers during the night of April 6/7th and destroyed part of the royal army, compelling d'Hocquincourt to withdraw toward Auxerre. For several hours, the royal court feared being taken prisoner in Gien. In the morning, however, Turenne, despite his numerical disadvantage against Cond√©, counter-attacked. Exploiting the terrain, the royalists got the better of the rebels. Cond√© withdrew toward Paris with what remained of his force. Among the rebel casualties was Nemours, who was wounded in the thigh amidst the fighting.1 Victory was claimed by both sides, but Turenne had ensured the safety of the king and managed to thwart Cond√©'s plans. The latter reached Paris by April 11 and quartered his forces there.  Aftermath  Bussy-Rabutin wrote in his memoirs: Pour le Mar√©chal de Turenne, il fit une action de grand Capitaine : car sans attendre les troupes du Mar√©chal d'Hocquincourt, il osa se pr√©senter en bataille devant le Prince de Cond√©, qui √©tait beaucoup plus fort que lui seul, mais qui, par la contenance du Mar√©chal de Turenne, crut que les deux Mar√©chaux √©taient d√©j√† rassembl√©s. La hardiesse de cette action qui n'√©tait pourtant pas t√©m√©raire, car le Mar√©chal de Turenne s'√©tait post√© fort avantageusement, sauva l'Etat : tout √©tait perdu s'il e√ªt voulu se m√©nager davantage. For Turenne, it was an action of a great captain: for without waiting for the [regrouping] of the troops of Marshall d‚ÄôHocquincourt, he dared to present himself in battle against Cond√©, who was much stronger than him alone, but who, due to the countenance of Turenne, believed that they [their forces] were equal in number. The hard-fought nature of this action was not reckless, for Turenne posted himself very well, saving the state: had he wished to hold back for his own sake, all would have been lost. Napoleon critiqued both generals in The Memorial of Saint-Helena. He judged that Cond√©, who possessed the greater force, could have been able to force Turenne's position. As for Turenne, Napoleon believed that he took too great a risk in confronting a larger force, and one whose morale had recently been bolstered by victory (referring to the victory against d‚ÄôHocquincourt). 2 References 1\\\\.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1896 to 1912 for the Cleveland Spiders, St. Louis Perfectos / Cardinals, Boston Americans / Red Sox, St. Louis Browns and New York Highlanders. Listed at and , he batted and threw right-handed. Biography Criger began his major league career with two games for the Cleveland Spiders of the National League in 1896. At the time, Cy Young was a pitcher for the Spiders; Young and Criger would remain teammates through 1908. During the 1897‚Äì1908 seasons, Young won 284 games, with Criger catching many of them. After playing for Cleveland through 1898, Criger and Young played in St. Louis in 1899 and 1900, then moved to the new American League franchise in Boston in 1901. Criger was the first Opening Day catcher in the team's history. In the first modern World Series in , he caught every inning of every game for Boston, helping his team win the championship. Criger was also the catcher for Cy Young's perfect game, the first perfect game in American League history, on May 5, 1904. Criger and Young remained with Boston through the 1908 season, the first year of the team being known as the Red Sox. Criger then spent the 1909 season with the St. Louis Browns and the 1910 season with the New York Highlanders; he finished his major league career with a single game for the Browns in 1912. In a 16-season major league career, Criger batted .221‚Äîcollecting 709 hits in 3202 at bats‚Äîwith 11 home runs and 342 RBIs. He had 58 stolen bases and scored 337 runs. Although never a major star, Criger received votes for the Baseball Hall of Fame in four years of balloting (1936‚Äì1939). He garnered a high of eight percent of the vote, being named on 16 of 201 ballots, in the 1937 balloting. Criger served as coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team in early 1907, until he had to report to Boston's spring training in mid-March. Born in February 1872 in Indiana, Criger died in May 1934 in Tucson, Arizona; he was survived by his wife, one daughter, and five sons.

Tillie is an amusement park \\"fun face\\", painted over the winter of 1955-1956. The name Tillie is likely a nod to George C. Tilyou, the owner of Steeplechase Park in Coney Island, New York, which features similar grinning face signage. In popular culture Tillie has inspired multiple merchandise based on it. Additionally, the mural has been featured in movies, Weird NJ magazine, TV shows such as The Sopranos, and a famous photo of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band early in their career. Tribute to Tillie on the Wonder Bar, Asbury Park, New Jersey Demolition Like many other boardwalk areas in the United States, such as Coney Island, New York, Asbury Park had fallen on hard times. Palace Amusements, built in 1888, closed in 1988, and the historic building fell into disrepair. When the Palace site was targeted for demolition and redevelopment, Asbury Park residents, Tillie fans, and Springsteen fans formed a grassroots effort to save Tillie, lobbying the state to block the demolition or at least remove the mural beforehand. The group was partially successful, as the left-side Tillie, as well as the \\"bumper girl\\" murals, were removed. The right-side Tillie was demolished. From June 8 to June 11, 2004, Save Tillie volunteers removed the mural from the Palace building. The building was demolished in July 2004. Tillie and other murals from the Palace building were to be incorporated into a new building on the site. The two wall sections with the Tillie mural are presently stored in Asbury Park, but the version on the Wonder Bar at Ocean Avenue is a replica.

The hill itself is a chalk outcrop, on the southwestern corner of Cranborne Chase, separated from the Dorset Downs by the River Stour. It is owned by the National Trust. Prehistory Hambledon Hill, as seen from Hod Hill Its earliest occupation was in the Neolithic when a pair of causewayed enclosures were dug at the top of the hill, one smaller than the other. They were linked by a bank and ditch running northwest‚Äìsoutheast. Two long barrows, one in length, also stood within the complex and a third enclosure is now known to underlie later earthworks. In all, the area of activity covered more than . Excavations in the 1970s and 1980s by Roger Mercer produced large quantities of Neolithic material. Environmental analysis indicated the site was occupied whilst the area was still wooded with forest clearances coming later, in the Bronze Age. The charcoal recovered seems to have come from timber lacing within the Neolithic earthworks. Radiocarbon analysis gives a date of 2850 BC. At least one skeleton, of a young man killed by an arrow was found, seemingly connected with the burning of the timber defences and suggesting at least one phase of violence. A single grape pip and a leaf fragment is evidence of vine cultivation and the occupants seem to have traded with sites further to the southwest. On Hambledon hill, looking north The ditches of the enclosures also contained significant quantities of pottery as well as red deer antler picks used to excavate them. Human skulls had been placed right at the bottom of one of the enclosure ditches possibly as a dedicatory or ancestral offering. Animal bone analysis suggests that most of the meat was consumed in late summer and early autumn, possibly indicating seasonal use of the site. Different material was found in different areas of the site suggesting that Hambledon Hill was divided up into zones of activity. The original interpretation was that the large causewayed enclosure was used as a mortuary enclosure for the ritual disposal of the dead and veneration of the ancestors with attendant feasting and social contact taking place in the smaller enclosure. Little remains of the Neolithic activity and the site is more easily identified as a prime example of an Iron Age hill fort. It was originally univallate but further circuits of banks and ditches were added increasing its size to . Three entrances served the fort, the southwestern with a long hornwork surrounding it. Hut platforms can be seen on the hillside. The site appears to have been abandoned around 300 BC possibly in favour of the nearby site of Hod Hill. Hambledon Hill is the first in a series of Iron Age earthworks,‚ÄòHill Forts of the Stour Valley‚Äô by David E. C. Jardine, 1985, Bournemouth Local Studies Publications which continues with Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final Iron Age monument in this small chain of sites. Battle of Hambledon Hill The Clubmen were a third force in the English Civil War, aligned to neither crown nor parliament, but striving to protect their land from being despoiled by foraging troops of either side. They armed themselves with clubs and agricultural implements and gathered in large numbers to protect their fields, especially in Dorset. Between 2,000 and 4,000 of them encamped on Hambledon Hill in August 1645. There were large numbers of Cromwell's troops in the area at that time, after the siege of Sherborne Castle. Cromwell ordered that the Clubmen be dispersed and his well-equipped New Model Army soon drove them away on 4 August. The leaders were arrested but Cromwell sent most home saying they were 'poor silly creatures'.The Clubmen of Dorset The Dorset Page by Brian Tompkins, 2000Battle of Hambledon Hill World History Database, Accessed September 2012 Hambledon Hill page 236, The Concise Encyclopedia of the Revolutions and Wars of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1639‚Äì1660, Stephen C.

In its most common form, it consists of a clamp that surrounds a vehicle wheel, designed to prevent removal of both itself and the wheel. In the United States, the device became known as a \\"Denver boot\\" after the city of Denver, Colorado, which was the first place in the country to employ them, mostly to force the payment of outstanding parking tickets. While primarily associated with law enforcement and parking violations, a variety of wheel clamps are now available to consumers as theft deterrent devices for personal use as an alternative to the steering-wheel lock. Functions Wheel clamps have five main functions: * To punish unauthorised or illegal parking, in lieu of towing the offending vehicle; in these cases, police or property owners who place the clamp may charge a high \\"release fee\\" to remove it * To enforce unpaid fines previously applied to the vehicle; a certain number of nonpayments or time elapsed from the issuance of the most recent fine results in clamping upon the next violation * To prevent driving by a suspended driver or moving of a disabled vehicle * To preclude escape of a prosecuted person * For security purposes, such as preventing a car, trailer, or caravan from being driven or towed away by a thief History As the automobile was introduced and became popular, cars also became a target for thieves and for a new concept that became known as joyriding. A variety of after-market security devices were introduced. An early invention were locking wheel clamps or chocks that owners could shackle onto one of the car's road wheels as a hobble, making it impossible to roll the vehicle unless the entire wheel was removed. Between 1914 and 1925 there were at least 25 patents related to wheel locks that attached on the tire and spoke wheel. These devices were available in many sizes from a number of manufacturers (including several patented by Miller- Chapman), and became popular during the early 1920s. The modern wheel clamp, originally known as the auto immobiliser, was invented in 1944 and patented in 1958 by Frank Marugg. Marugg was a pattern maker, a violinist with the Denver Symphony Orchestra, and a friend of many Denver politicians and police department officials. The police department needed a solution to a growing parking enforcement problem. The city towed ticketed cars to the pound, where they were often vandalised. Those whose cars were damaged sued the city for losses and the police had to itemize everything in the cars. Dan Stills, head of the city's traffic division, thought an immobilizer would avoid the expensive towing problem and approached Marugg with an idea to improve on the device to keep the cars where they were parked. The Denver police first used the wheel boot on 5 January 1955 and collected over US$18,000 (US$ in dollars) in its first month of use. Although the wheel boot was first cast in steel, Marugg soon switched to a lighter aluminum-based alloy. Marugg later sold the device to parking lot owners, hotels and ski resorts, as well as a Jumbo version for farm equipment and larger vehicles. The Smithsonian Institution now has a copy of Marugg's boot on display in Washington, D.C. By 1970 Marugg had sold 2,000 boots. Although the patent ran out in 1976 and modern car and truck wheels necessitated a redesign, Marugg's daughter kept up the business until 1986. Clancy Systems International, later bought the rights to the boot. The boot allowed Denver to maintain one of the largest collection rates for parking fines of any city in the US through its first fifty years. The best known wheel clamp in the UK is the 'London Wheel Clamp'. The designer, Trevor Whitehouse filed the patent in 1991. He originally called the device the 'Preston', after his home town in Lancashire. Primarily used on private land, its notoriety grew once it was introduced to public roads under the Road Traffic Regulations Act of 1991 (commonly known as the de-criminalising of the yellow lines act). The first areas in the country to be decriminalised were the 33 London Boroughs during 1993/94, hence the name change. Controversy Wheel-clamping is notoriously unpopular with unauthorised parkers. While a traffic warden or police officer has jurisdiction over public roads, in many countries, the law allows landowners to clamp vehicles parking on their property without permission. One British man became so annoyed at having his car clamped that he removed the clamp with an angle grinder. He subsequently received publicity as a self-styled \\"superhero\\" called ‚ÄúAngle-Grinder Man‚Äù, offering to remove clamps for free with his angle grinder. Other motorists have cut the clamps off with bolt cutters or even clamping their own cars beforehand so that property owners will be unable to clamp an already-clamped vehicle and may think that another owner has clamped it. However, the practice of removing clamps is usually only done for those that were installed by firms and other citizens; the removal of clamps installed by authorities (chiefly the police) is an offence. A New Zealand wheel clamper made national headlines in 2013 after he secretly recorded a police officer allegedly threatening to not help if an aggrieved member of the public attacked him. It was not the first time the clamper involved had been in the news. Legal issues Several vehicles wheel-clamped at University of North Texas, Denton, Texas =United Kingdom= In Scotland, local authorities are permitted by statute to clamp, tow, or otherwise remove vehicles. Outside that statutory authority, clamping on private land was found to be unlawful in the case Black v Carmichael (1992) SCCR 709, which held that immobilising a vehicle constitutes extortion and theft. Writing in dismissal of parking contractor Alan Black's appeal to the High Court of Justiciary, the Lord Justice General (Lord Hope) cited case law which said \\"every man has a right to dispute the demand of his creditor in a court of justice\\" and himself wrote \\"it is illegal for vehicles to be held to ransom in the manner described in these charges\\". In England and Wales, The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 criminalised certain wheel-clamping activity on private land without lawful authority from 1 October 2012. This prohibits clamping in many common locations such as supermarket car parks, but clamping is not entirely banned. For example, a railway operator may clamp a vehicle under the provisions of Railway Byelaw 14(4). The act of clamping is still lawful by the police, DVLA, local authority, etc. but not by a private person or company acting on behalf of their own interests on either public or private property. For example, a person cannot lawfully be clamped on property such as a hospital site, private driveway, car park not operated by a local or government authority, etc. The only exception to this is if the clamping company are acting on behalf of a government agency e.g. contracted on behalf of the DVLA. To allow landowners to deal with unauthorised vehicles the same statute allows land owners to hold the registered keeper of a vehicle liable for any charges relating to breach of contract under certain circumstances. Landowners who seek to enforce 'Parking Charge Notices' (contractual payment terms) establish the contract through the use of onsite signage detailing the 'conditions'. =United States= A wheel clamp from Paylock that was removed from a vehicle. This device has a keypad where the driver can obtain a code over the phone and remove it after paying a fee. Despite it being illegal for private operators to immobilise vehicles with these types of devices in the U.S. state of Washington, the practice continues. In February 2013 charges were laid against a private parking operator, along with the property owner, in the city of Los Angeles for attaching wheel clamps to vehicles in a privately owned parking lot. =Ireland= Clamped car in Ireland, with note on driver's side window warning the owner not to attempt to drive away. In the Republic of Ireland, clamping in public places is legal under a 1988 amendment to the Road Traffic Act 1961. Clamping in private car parks is widespread but not regulated by statute, and the legality of the practice is unclear. The breaches for which an \\"immobilisation device\\" may be fitted under the 1961 act are those specified in sections 35, 36, and 36A of the Road Traffic Act 1994 as amended (respectively \\"Regulations for general control of traffic and pedestrians\\", \\"Parking of vehicles in parking places on public roads\\", and \\"Bye-laws for restriction on parking ‚Äî specified events\\"). Regulations under the 1994 act are made by statutory instrument by the minister responsible for transport (currently the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport). Local authorities have delegated the clamping activity to private companies. This contrasts with traffic wardens, who are employees of the authority. Existing statutory provisions are due to be replaced by the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015, passed as part of the Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour coalition's 2011 programme for government.; The 2015 act regulates private as well as public clamping. It also seeks to improve and standardise the level of fines and the appeals process, which have been the focus of public dissatisfaction.

Its oldest preserved copy is in Latin from the 17th century, while it has been variously claimed by modern historians to have been compiled between the late 12th and early 15th century. Historians have largely discounted the work as based on inaccuracies and fiction. It recounts the history of Dalmatia and nearby regions from the 5th to the mid-12th century. It contains some semi-mythological material on the early history of the Western South Slavs. The section \\"The Life of St. Jovan Vladimir\\", is believed to be a fictional account of an earlier history. Authorship and date The work was purportedly compiled by an anonymous \\"priest of Duklja\\" (presbyter Diocleas, known in Serbo-Croatian as pop Dukljanin). The work is preserved only in its Latin redactions from a 17th-century printing.S. Bujan, La Chronique du pretre de Dioclee. Un faux document historique, Revuedes etudes byzantines 66 (2008) 5‚Äì38 Dmine Papaliƒá, a nobleman from Split, found the text which he transcribed in 1509‚Äì10, which was translated by Marko Maruliƒá into Latin in 1510, with the title Regnum Dalmatiae et Croatiae gesta. Mavro Orbin, a Ragusan historian, included the work (amongst other works) in his Il regno de gli Slavi (ca. 1601); Johannes Lucius did the same in ca. 1666. These Latin redactions claim that the original was written in Slavic. The chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 in the town of Bar (in Montenegro), then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was presbyter Rudger (or Rudiger), the Catholic Archbishop of Bar (Antivari), who was probably of Czech origin. He is thought to have lived around 1300 because Bosnian borders are referred to in a way that coincides with an anonymous text, the Anonymi Descriptio Europae Orientalis (Cracow, 1916), that has been dated to the year 1308. Early 21st-century research has established that Rudger flourished in ca. 1296‚Äì1300. Chapters 1‚Äì33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions; these are largely dismissed by historians. However, the next three chapters possess invaluable historical data about this time period. Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 (on Saint Jovan Vladimir), a summary of an older hagiography dating between 1075 and 1089 (when the Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric), contains considerable historical data that has been found to be reliable. Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father and uncles, are likely based on the prologue of this 11th-century hagiography. Other obsolete and refuted theories include that the author lived in the second half of the 12th century. Some Croatian historians put forward the theory, of E. Periƒçiƒá (1991), that the anonymous author was a Grgur Barski (Gregory of Bar), a bishop of Bar, who lived in the second half of the 12th century. The bishopric of Bar was defunct at that time. In his 1967 reprint of the work, Yugoslav historian Slavko Miju≈°koviƒá said that the chronicle is a purely fictional literary product, belonging to the late 14th or early 15th century. Serbian historian Tibor ≈Ωivkoviƒá, in the monograph Gesta regum Sclavorum (2009), concluded that its main parts are dated to ca. 1300‚Äì10. Content Regnum Sclavorum (1601) can be divided into the following sections: * Introduction (Auctor ad lectorem) * Libellus Gothorum, chapters I‚ÄìVII * Constantine's Legend (or \\"Pannonian Legend\\"), chapters VIII and beginning of IX * Methodius (Liber sclavorum qui dicitur Methodius), rest of chapter IX * Travunian Chronicle, chapters X‚ÄìXXXV, in two parts * The Life of St. Jovan Vladimir, chapter XXXVI * History of Dioclea, chapters XXXVII‚ÄìLXVII The author attempted to present an overview of ruling families over the course of over two centuries ‚Äî from the 10th century up to the time of writing, the 12th century. There are 47 chapters in the text, of different sizes and varying subject matter. Folklore and translations The work is actually a number of separate but similar manuscripts, stemming from an original source that does not survive but assumed to have been written by the Priest of Duklja himself (or other monk-scribes giving a helping hand). It has been generally agreed that this Presbyter included in his work folklore and literary material from Slavic sources which he translated into Latin. Among the material he translated, rather than created, is \\"The Legend of Prince Vladimir\\" which is supposed to have been written by another clergyman, also from Duklja, more specifically, Zeƒçanin from Krajina in Zeta or Duklja (an earlier name for Zeta). In its original version, it was a hagiographic work, a \\"Life of St. Vladimir\\" rather than a \\"Legend.\\" Prince Vladimir, the protagonist of the story, as well as King Vladislav, who ordered Vladimir's execution, were historical persons, yet \\"The Legend of Prince Vladimir\\" contains non- historical material. The chronicle was also added to by a bishop of Bar intent on demonstrating his diocese' superiority over that of Bishop of Split. In 1986, the chronicle was translated from the Croation into Ukrainian by Antin V. Iwachniuk. The translation was financed by the Iwachniuk Ukrainian Studies and Research Fund at the University of Ottawa. Assessment =Historical value, fiction= Various inaccurate or simply wrong claims in the text make it an unreliable source. Modern historians have serious doubts about the majority of this work as being mainly fictional, or wishful thinking. Some go as far as to say that it can be dismissed in its entirety, but that is not a majority opinion, rather, it is thought to have given us a unique insight into the whole era from the point of view of the indigenous Slavic population and it is still a topic of discussion. The work describes the local Slavs as a peaceful people imported by the Goth rulers, who invaded the area in the 5th century, but it doesn't attempt to elaborate on how and when this happened. This information contradicts the information found in the Byzantine text De Administrando Imperio. The Chronicle also mentions one Svetopeleg or Svetopelek, the eighth descendant of the original Goth invaders, as the main ruler of the lands that cover Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro (Duklja) and Serbia. He is also credited with the Christianization of the people who are Goths or Slavs ‚Äî a purely fictitious attribution. These claims about a unified kingdom are probably a reflection of the earlier glory of the Moravian kingdom. He may also have been talking about Avars. The priest's parish was located at the seat of the archbishopric of Duklja. According to Bishop Gregory's late 12th-century additions to this document, this Archbishopric covered much of the western Balkans including the bishoprics of Bar, Budva, Kotor, Ulcinj, Svaƒç, Skadar, Drivast, Pulat, Travunia, Zahumlje. Map of fictituous Slavic kingdom of king Svetopelek in the Western Balkans as it has been described in the chronicle. Further, it mentions Bosnia (Bosnam) and Rascia (Rassa) as the two Serbian lands, while describing the southern Dalmatian Hum/Zahumlje, Travunia and Dioclea (most of today's Herzegovina, Montenegro, as well as parts of Croatia and Albania) as Croatian lands (\\"Red Croatia\\"), which is a description inconsistent with all other historical works from the same period. The archbishop of Bar was later named Primas Serbiae. Ragusa had some claims to be considered the natural ecclesiastical centre of South Dalmatia but those of Dioclea (Bar) to this new metropolitan status were now vigorously pushed especially as the Pope intended Serbia to be attached to Dioclea. In his 1967 reprint of the work, Yugoslav historian Slavko Miju≈°koviƒá stated that the chronicle is a purely fictional literary product, belonging to the late 14th or early 15th century. =Region of Bosnia= The region of Bosnia is described to span the area west of the river Drina, \\"up to the Pine mountain\\" (, ). The location of this Pine mountain is unknown. In 1881, Croatian historian Franjo Raƒçki wrote that this refers to the mountain of \\"Borova glava\\" near the Livno field. Croatian historian Luka Jeliƒá wrote the mountain was located either between Maglaj and Skender Vakuf, northwest of ≈Ωepƒçe, or it was the mountain Borovina located between Vranica and Radovna, according to Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá's 1908 work. In 1935, Serbian historian Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá wrote that the toponym refers to the mountain of Borova glava, because of etymology and because it is located on the watershed (drainage divide).Vladimir ƒÜoroviƒá, Teritorijalni razvoj bosanske dr≈æave u srednjem vijeku, Glas SKA 167, Belgrade, 1935, pp. 10-13 In 1936, Slovene ethnologist Niko ≈Ωupaniƒç had also interpreted that to mean that the western border of Bosnia was at some drainage divide mountains, but placed it to the southeast of Dinara.Niko ≈Ωupaniƒç, Znaƒçenje barvnega atributa v imenu ‚ÄûCrvena Hrvatska\\". Lecture at the IV Congress of Slavic geographers and ethnographers, Sofia, 18 August 1936. Croatian historian Anto Babiƒá, based on the work of Dominik Mandiƒá in 1978, inferred that the term refers roughly to a place of the drainage divide between the Sava and Adriatic Sea watersheds.D. Mandiƒá, Dr≈æavna i vjerska pripadnost sredovjeƒçne Bosne i Hecegovine. II. edition, Ziral, Chicago‚ÄìRome 1978, pp. 408-409. In her discussion of ƒÜoroviƒá, Serbian historian Jelena Mrgiƒá-Radojƒçiƒá also points to the existence of a mountain of \\"Borja\\" in today's northern Bosnia with the same etymology.

It encompasses the interface between law and psychiatry. According to the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, it is defined as \\"a subspecialty of psychiatry in which scientific and clinical expertise is applied in legal contexts involving civil, criminal, correctional, regulatory, or legislative matters, and in specialized clinical consultations in areas such as risk assessment or employment.\\" A forensic psychiatrist provides services ‚Äì such as determination of competency to stand trial ‚Äì to a court of law to facilitate the adjudicative process and provide treatment, such as medications and psychotherapy, to criminals. Court work Forensic psychiatrists work with courts in evaluating an individual's competency to stand trial, defenses based on mental disorders (e.g., the insanity defense), and sentencing recommendations. The two major areas of criminal evaluations in forensic psychiatry are competency to stand trial (CST) and mental state at the time of the offense (MSO). =Competency to stand trial= Competency to stand trial (CST) is the competency evaluation to determine that defendants have the mental capacity to understand the charges and assist their attorneys. In the United States, this is seated in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which ensures the right to be present at one's trial, to face one's accusers, and to have help from an attorney. CST, sometimes referred to as adjudicative competency, serves three purposes: \\"preserving the dignity of the criminal process, reducing the risk of erroneous convictions, and protecting defendants‚Äô decision-making autonomy\\". In 1960, the Supreme Court of the United States in Dusky v. United States established the standard for federal courts, ruling that ‚Äúthe test must be whether the defendant has sufficient present ability to consult with his attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and a rational as well as factual understanding of proceedings against him.\\" The evaluations must assess a defendant's ability to assist their legal counsel, meaning that they understand the legal charges against them, the implications of being a defendant, and the adversarial nature of the proceedings, including the roles played by defense counsel, prosecutors, judges, and the jury. They must be able to communicate relevant information to their attorney, and understand information provided by their attorney. Finally, they must be competent to make important decisions, such as whether or not to accept a plea agreement. In England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, a similar legal concept is that of \\"fitness to plead\\". =As an expert witness= Forensic psychiatrists are often called to be expert witnesses in both criminal and civil proceedings. Expert witnesses give their opinions about a specific issue. Often, the psychiatrist will have prepared a detailed report before testifying. The primary duty of the expert witness is to provide an independent opinion to the court. An expert is allowed to testify in court with respect to matters of opinion only when the matters in question are not ordinarily understandable to the finders of fact, be they judge or jury. As such, prominent leaders in the field of forensic psychiatry, from Thomas Gutheil to Robert Simon and Liza Gold and others have identified teaching as a critical dimension in the role of expert witness. The expert will be asked to form an opinion and to testify about that opinion, but in so doing will explain the basis for that opinion, which will include important concepts, approaches, and methods used in psychiatry. =Mental state opinion= Mental state opinion (MSO) gives the court an opinion, and only an opinion, as to whether a defendant was able to understand what he/she was doing at the time of the crime. This is worded differently in many states, and has been rejected altogether in some, but in every setting, the intent to do a criminal act and the understanding of the criminal nature of the act bear on the final disposition of the case. Much of forensic psychiatry is guided by significant court rulings or laws that bear on this area which include these three standards: * M'Naghten rules: Excuses a defendant who, by virtue of a defect of reason or disease of the mind, does not know the nature and quality of the act, or, if he or she does, does not know that the act is indeed wrong.M'Naghten's Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843) * Durham rule: Excuses a defendant whose conduct is the product of mental disorder.Durham v. United States, 214 f.2d 862 (D.C. Cir. 1954), overruled in U.S. v. Brawner, 471 f.2d 969 (D.C. Cir. 1972) * ALI test: Excuses a defendant who, because of a mental disease or defect, lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality (wrongfulness) of his or her conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.Model Penal Code, Sec. 4.01 (1) \\"Not guilty by reason of insanity\\" (NGRI) is one potential outcome in this type of trial. Importantly, insanity is a legal and not a medical term. Often, psychiatrists may be testifying for both the defense and the prosecution. Forensic psychiatrists are also involved in the care of prisoners, both in jails and prisons, and in the care of the mentally ill who have committed criminal acts (such as those who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity). Risk management Many past offenders against other people, and suspected or potential future offenders with mental health problems or an intellectual or developmental disability, are supervised in the community by forensic psychiatric teams made up of a variety of professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, and care workers. These teams have dual responsibilities: to promote both the welfare of their clients and the safety of the public. The aim is not so much to predict as to prevent violence, by means of risk management. Risk assessment and management is a growth area in the forensic field, with much Canadian academic work being done in Ontario and British Columbia. This began with the attempt to predict the likelihood of a particular kind of offense being repeated, by combining \\"static\\" indicators from personal history and offense details in actuarial instruments such as the RRASOR and Static-99, which were shown to be more accurate than unaided professional judgment. More recently, use is being made also of \\"dynamic\\" risk factors, such as attitudes, impulsivity, mental state, family and social circumstances, substance use, and the availability and acceptance of support, to make a \\"structured professional judgment.\\" The aim of this is to move away from prediction to prevention, by identifying and then managing risk factors. This may entail monitoring, treatment, rehabilitation, supervision, and victim safety planning and depends on the availability of funding and legal powers. These schemes may be based on published assessments such as the HCR-20 (which incorporates 10 Historical, 5 Clinical and 5 Risk Management factors) and the risk of sexual violence protocol from Simon Fraser University, BC. United Kingdom In the UK, most forensic psychiatrists work for the National Health Service, in specialist secure units caring for mentally ill offenders (as well as people whose behaviour has made them impossible to manage in other hospitals). These can be either medium secure units (of which there are many throughout the country) or high secure hospitals (also known as special hospitals), of which three are in England and one in Scotland (the State Hospital, Carstairs), the best known of which is Broadmoor Hospital. The other 'specials' are Ashworth hospital in Maghull, Liverpool, and Rampton hospital in Nottinghamshire. Also, a number of private-sector medium secure units sell their beds exclusively to the NHS, as not enough secure beds are available in the NHS system. Forensic psychiatrists often also do prison inreach work, in which they go into prisons and assess and treat people suspected of having mental disorders; much of the day-to-day work of these psychiatrists comprises care of very seriously mentally ill patients, especially those suffering from schizophrenia. Some units also treat people with severe personality disorder or learning disabilities. The areas of assessment for courts are also somewhat different in Britain, because of differing mental health law. Fitness to plead and mental state at the time of the offence are indeed issues given consideration, but the mental state at the time of trial is also a major issue, and this assessment most commonly leads to the use of mental health legislation to detain people in hospitals, as opposed to their getting a prison sentence. Learning-disabled offenders who are a continuing risk to others may be detained in learning-disability hospitals (or specialised community-based units with a similar regimen, as the hospitals have mostly been closed). This includes those who commit serious crimes of violence, including sexual violence, and fire-setting. They would be cared for by learning disability psychiatrists and registered learning disability nurses. Some psychiatrists doing this work have dual training in learning disability and forensic psychiatry or learning disability and adolescent psychiatry. Some nurses would have training in mental health, also. Court work (medicolegal work) is generally undertaken as private work by psychiatrists (most often forensic psychiatrists), as well as forensic and clinical psychologists, who usually also work within the NHS. This work is generally funded by the Legal Services Commission (used to be called Legal Aid). Canada =Criminal law framework= In Canada, certain credentialed medical practitioners may, at their discretion, make state-sanctioned investigations into and diagnosis of mental illness. Appropriate use of the DSM-IV-TR is discussed in its section entitled \\"Use of the DSM-IV-TR in Forensic Settings\\". Concerns have been expressed that the Canadian criminal justice system discriminates based on DSM IV diagnosis within the context of Part XX of the Criminal Code.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, Part XX.1. This part sets out provisions for, among other things, court ordered attempts at \\"treatment\\" before individuals receive a trial as described in section 672.58 of the Criminal Code. Also provided for are court ordered \\"psychiatric assessments\\". Critics have also expressed concerns that use of the DSM-IV-TR may conflict with section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the fundamental freedom of \\"thought, belief, opinion, and expression\\". =Confidentiality= The position of the Canadian Psychiatric Association holds, \\"in recent years, serious incursions have been made by governments, powerful commercial interests, law enforcement agencies, and the courts on the rights of persons to their privacy.\\" It goes on to state, \\"breaches or potential breaches of confidentiality in the context of therapy seriously jeopardize the quality of the information communicated between patient and psychiatrist and also compromise the mutual trust and confidence necessary for effective therapy to occur.\\"Canadian Psychiatric Association, The Confidentiality of Psychiatric Records and the Patient's Right to Privacy(2000-21S) An outline of the forensic psychiatric process as it occurs in the province of Ontario is presented in the publication The Forensic Mental Health System In Ontario: An Information GuideCentre for Addiction and Mental Health, The Forensic Mental Health System in Ontario: An Information Guide.\\" published by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. The Guide states: \\"Whatever you tell a forensic psychiatrist and the other professionals assessing you is not confidential.\\" The Guide further states: \\"The forensic psychiatrist will report to the court using any available information, such as: police and hospital records, information given by your friends, family or co-workers, observations of you in the hospital.\\" Also according to the Guide: \\"You have the right to refuse to take part in some or all of the assessment. Sometimes your friends or family members will be asked for information about you. They have the right to refuse to answer questions, too.\\"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, \\"What Happens Inside the Forensic Mental Health System?\\" Of note, the emphasis in the guide is on the right to refuse participation. This may seem unusual given that a result of a verdict of \\"Not Criminally Responsible by reason of Mental Disorder\\" is often portrayed as desirable to the defence, similar to the insanity defense in the United States. A verdict of \\"Not Criminally Responsible\\" is referred to as a \\"defence\\" by the Criminal Code.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 16, \\"defence of mental disorder\\". However, the issue of the accused's mental state can also be raised by the Crown or by the court itself, rather than solely by the defence counsel, differentiating it from many other legal defences.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, ss 672.11, 672.12. =Treatment/assessment conflict= In Ontario, a court-ordered inpatient forensic assessment for criminal responsibility typically involves both treatment and assessment being performed with the accused in the custody of a single multidisciplinary team over a 30- or 60-day period. Concerns have been expressed that an accused may feel compelled on ethical, medical, or legal grounds to divulge information, medical, or otherwise, to assessors in an attempt to allow for and ensure safe and appropriate treatment during that period of custody. Some Internet references address treatment/assessment conflict as it relates to various justice systems, particularly civil litigation in other jurisdictions. The American Academy Of Psychiatry and the Law states in its ethics guidelines, \\"when a treatment relationship exists, such as in correctional settings, the usual physician-patient duties apply\\", which may be seen as contradiction.American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, \\"Ethics Guidelines for the Practice of Forensic Psychiatry\\". Adopted May, 2005. South Africa In South Africa, patients are referred for observation for a period of 30 days by the courts if questions exist as to CST and MSO. Serious crimes require a panel, which may include two or more psychiatrists. Should the courts find the defendant not criminally responsible, the defendant may become a state patient and be admitted in a forensic psychiatric hospital.Kaliski, S. Z. (2006). Psycholegal assessment in South Africa. Oxford: Oxford University Press. They are referred to receive treatment for an indefinite period, but most were back in the community after three years.

Training standards Some practitioners of forensic psychiatry have taken extra training in that specific area. In the United States, one-year fellowships are offered in this field to psychiatrists who have completed their general psychiatry training. Such psychiatrists may then be eligible to sit for a board certification examination in forensic psychiatry. In Britain, one is required to complete a three-year subspeciality training in forensic psychiatry, after completing one's general psychiatry training, before receiving a Certificate of Completion of Training as a forensic psychiatrist. In some countries, general psychiatrists can practice forensic psychiatry, as well. However, other countries, such as Japan, require a specific certification from the government to do this type of work. See also *Forensic psychology *Daubert v.

Located on the city's West Side, it is the second largest community area by population (behind Lake View) and the second-largest geographically (behind South Deering). Austin's eastern boundary is the Belt Railway located just east of Cicero Avenue. Its northernmost border is the Milwaukee District / West Line. Its southernmost border is at Roosevelt Road from the Belt Railway west to Austin Boulevard. The northernmost portion, north of North Avenue, extends west to Harlem Avenue, abutting Elmwood Park. In addition to Elmwood Park, Austin also borders the suburbs of Cicero and Oak Park. History =Early development= In 1835, Henry DeKoven purchased prairie land in the region. In 1857, a group of citizens formed the Town of Cicero, a ten-member local governing body that covered modern day Cicero, Oak Park, Berwyn and Austin. Eight years later, DeKoven's land was bought by Henry W. Austin. Austin, a businessman and real estate speculator, developed the namesake Austinville subdivision. Its population grew exponentially as the area's attractive amenities and access to suburban railroad service drew in population. In 1870, the Town of Cicero placed its town hall in Austin. However, by the 1890s, the heavily populated Austin area dominated town politics, but did not constitute a majority of voters. The Austin-controlled township government allowed the Lake Street Elevated to extend into Oak Park. Outraged, the other residents of Cicero Township voted to allow Chicago to annex the Austin area in an 1899 referendum. The residents of Austin voted against the referendum. =Neighborhood growth= After its annexation, Austin continued to maintain an independent, suburban identity. By the 1920s, the area had developed significant street railways to serve its commuter population. This infrastructure attracted a large group of European immigrants to the community. In 1926, it was estimated the area had approximately 140,000 residents. In 1923, Austin Hospital opened. In 1938, the hospital, now called William Temperance Hospital, was taken over by Sisters of Saint Casimir who operated the hospital as Loretto Hospital. In 1949, construction began on the Eisenhower Expressway which bisected the southern portion of Austin. =African-American migration, white flight and economic decline.= After World War II, African-Americans increasingly moved into the surrounding community areas of East Garfield Park, North Lawndale, and West Garfield Park. Crime rates in 1960's were virtually non-existent while the Austin community was near exclusively white middle class. After the arrival of African Americans during the Great Migration, white Chicagoans left in mass due to race and integration related prejudices, economic decline, and safety concerns during the white flight movement. Following the arrival of African Americans, Austin then experienced a dramatic decrease in white residents, white owned businesses, and industrial jobs. By 1970, despite the aggressive blockbusting efforts of realtors, the Austin community was 32% black. A decade later, it was 73% black. This trend would continue for the rest of the twentieth century with Austin becoming a stronghold for Chicago's African American middle class. The Austin community was hit hard by the Crack Cocaine Epidemic, Mass Incarceration, and the HIV Epidemic, which resulted in further economic decline and the loss of many social safety nets. This led to many upper middle class African Americans leaving for the suburbs. The latter half of the twentieth century further municipal saw significant divestment from the community. The Central station on the Chicago Transportation Agency's Congress Line was closed on September 2, 1973. In 1988, West Side Health Authority was formed after the closure of St. Anne's Hospital. In 1991, the Sisters of Saint Casimir gave control of Loretto Hospital to a management company. =21st century= In 1999, developers agreed to turn the abandoned Galewood rail yard into an industrial park. During the development of the property, then-Alderman Ike Carothers solicited a bribe to allow the permitting process and zoning changes to move forward. The subsequent trials created a political scandal, and ended with the conviction of the developer and Carothers on various felony charges. The $60 million development ultimately brought new homes and a movie theater to the neighborhood. Neighborhoods Austin is Chicago's second largest community area both by population and by land area. The Austin community area is made up of four neighborhoods; Galewood, The Island, North Austin and South Austin. =Galewood= Galewood is named for Abram Gale who bought a farm on the area in 1838. The neighborhood is bordered by the Milwaukee District / West Line to the north, Harlem Avenue to the west, North Avenue to the south and Narragansett Avenue to the east. The area is a historically Italian-American community with a sizable population of Chicago city employees. Since the 1980s, it has seen an increase in African American and Latino residents, but this integration has occurred peacefully in contrast with other areas of Chicago. Galewood has two stations on the Milwaukee District West Line. The first station, Mars station functions as a stop for employees of the nearby Mars, Incorporated factory and Shriners Hospitals for Children, the latter of which is located in Montclare. The Mars station only stops during traditional commuting hours. The second, Galewood station is located east of Mars station and is a regular service station. The neighborhood has strong ties with neighboring Montclare, including sharing a namesake library in the Chicago Public Library system, and is sometimes considered as part of that neighborhood and not the Austin community. Galewood is significantly whiter than the remainder of Austin. Galewood is 22.51% White, 50.17% African American, and 1.77% from two or more races. Residents who self-identify as Hispanic or Latino of any race were 23.96% of the total Galewood population with the western half of Galewood being 36% white and 31% African American. =The Island= The Island neighborhood is located in the southwest corner of the Austin community. It has a population of approximately 1,700 residents. It encompasses roughly a square mile and its western and southern borders are to the suburbs of Oak Park and Cicero respectively. It is further isolated from the rest of Austin by an industrial corridor to its east and railroad tracks and Interstate 290 to the north. It is only accessible from Austin Boulevard & Roosevelt Road. The Island was the last of Austin's neighborhoods to integrate. In the 1980s, when the rest of Austin was over 70% African-American, the Island did not have a single African-American family. In 1984, when an African-American family attempted to move in on Roosevelt Road, they were met with violent resistance and shortly moved out. Politically, the area went heavily for Jane Byrne in the Democratic primary and for Edward Vrdolyak against Harold Washington in the 1987 mayoral election that broke down on racial lines. Today, the Island is an integrated community. The area, once industrial, has a diverse economy. Chicago Studio City, the largest film studio in the Midwestern United States, is located here. The films Transformers: Dark of the Moon, The Dark Knight and Public Enemies were partially filmed in The Island as were episodes of Empire and Shameless. = North Austin = One of Austin's neighborhoods is North Austin, its boundaries starts north at Milwaukee District/West Line and Armitage Avenue, Western boundaries are Austin Avenue or Austin Boulevard south of North Avenue, Eastern boundaries to Cicero Avenue, and Southern boundaries to Division Street. The Robert LeFlore, Jr. Post Office at 5001 West Division Street is in this neighborhood. = South Austin = South Austin is the area's largest neighborhood. It is bordered by Division Street to the north, Austin Boulevard to the west, Roosevelt Road to the south and Cicero Avenue to the east. During the Austin area's transition from a predominantly white community to a predominantly African-American community, the South Austin neighborhood was the first neighborhood to become African-American majority. The neighborhood is characterized by its numerous historic buildings. The neighborhood is home to six landmarks on the National Register of Historic Places; Austin Historic District, Midway Park, Austin Town Hall Park Historic District, Columbus Park, First Congregational Church of Austin, Joseph J. Walser House and the Seth Warner House. Austin Town Hall Park, modeled after Philadelphia's Independence Hall, is also in this neighborhood. It is also home to an additional seven Chicago Landmarks not listed on the National Register of Historic Places; Beeson House and Coach House, Hitchcock House, Laramie State Bank Building, Schlect House, F. R. Schock House, Marie Schock House and the Third Unitarian Church. Demographics According to a 2016 analysis by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, there were 99,711 people and 32,277 households residing in the area. The racial makeup of the area was 4.20% White, 84.20% African American, 0.50% Asian, 0.80% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.30% of the population. In the area, the population was spread out, with 30.50% under the age of 19, 20.80% from 20 to 34, 18.70% from 35 to 49, 18.40% from 50 to 64, and 11.60% who were 65 years of age or older. The media age was 33.9. The median household income for the area was $31,435 as opposed to $47,831 for the city. The area's residents were disproportionately lower income with 41.0% of residents earned less than $25,000, 27.6% of residents earned between $25,000 and $49,999, 14.1% earned between $50,000 to $74,999, 8.0% earned between $75,000 and $99,999, 6.4% earned between $100,000 and $149,999, 2.9% earned $150,000 or more. There were 41,807 residents in the labor force. 18.9% of workers were employed in the healthcare industry, 11.3% were employed in retail, 11% were employed in administration, 8.4% worked in education, and 8.3% worked in hospitality and food services. The area had an unemployment rate of 22.1%. Crime The Chicago Tribune \\"Crime in Chicagoland\\" page, the Austin neighborhood ranked 11th out of 77 community areas in Chicago in violent crime, 25th among Chicago community areas in property crimes, and 5th out of 100 for quality of life crimes. Education Children reading at the \\"Robert Emmet School\\" in 1911. The school, located at 5500 W Madison Street, closed in 2013. Austin Community Academy High School closed after spring 2007. New smaller schools have replaced Austin Community Academy High School: Austin Business and Entrepreneurship Academy, which opened in 2006, and Austin Polytechnical Academy, which opened in September 2007. Other portions of the community area are zoned to Manley High School, Marshall H.S., and Orr Campus. Media Austin is served by three free weekly newspapers. The West Suburban Journal, founded in 2004, is published by West Suburban Journal, a black-owned press published by Trottie Publishing, based in the West Cook County suburb of Westchester. The founder and publisher of West Suburban Journal and West Cook Journal, L. Nicole Trottie, is the first black woman in Illinois history to start an accredited weekly newspaper. Trottie is also the first African American woman ever elected to the Illinois Press Association's Board of Directors in its 150-year newspaper-rich history. The Austin Voice has been published in Austin since 1988. The Austin Weekly News, founded in 2005, is published by The Wednesday Journal, a publisher of free weekly newspapers based in Oak Park, Illinois. Both papers are published on Wednesdays and distributed in stores, office buildings and recreational venues throughout the community. Austin is also served by Austin Talks, an online publication maintained by journalism students at Chicago's Columbia College and underwritten in part by the Chicago Community Trust. Politics Austin is a stronghold for the Democratic Party. In the 2016 presidential election, Austin cast 37,492 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 1,280 votes for Donald Trump. Despite this landslide victory, it was Clinton's 23rd largest margin of victory by percentage points in the 76 community areas she won. In the 2012 presidential election, Austin cast 44,734 votes for Barack Obama and 965 votes for Mitt Romney. It was Obama's 24th largest margin of victory by percentage points in the 76 community areas he won. At the local level, Austin is located in Chicago's 28th, 29th, and 37th represented by Democrats Jason Ervin, Chris Taliaferro, and Emma Mitts respectively. Notable residents * William J.P.

Scraps) is a character from the fantasy Oz Book series by L. Frank Baum.Jack Snow, Who's Who in Oz, Chicago, Reilly & Lee, 1954; New York, Peter Bedrick Books, 1988; pp. 156-7. She first appeared in The Patchwork Girl of Oz. History Scraps is a teenaged (possibly fourteen) living rag doll made of patchwork, button eyes, brown yarn hair, a felt tongue, and pearl teeth. She was originally brought to life by a Munchkin magician named Dr. Pipt by means of his Powder of Life formula to be a servant for his wife Margolotte. Ojo overloaded her with magic brains in the process of bringing her to life, and as she happily jumped around she accidentally spilled the Liquid of Petrifaction on Mrs. Pipt and Ojo's uncle turning them to stone. Much of their first adventure is gathering the ingredients to find a counterspell. She later became the companion of the Scarecrow who found her quite beautiful. She had major roles in such Oz books as The Gnome King of Oz and The Wonder City of Oz, and was the title character in A Runaway in Oz. The Patchwork Girl was likely influenced by the character of Topsy in Uncle Tom's Cabin, and she may have influenced the character of Raggedy Ann.Robin Bernstein, Racial Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Slavery to Civil Rights, (New York: New York University Press, 2011), 163-172. Scraps in other media Illustration by Andr√© Koehne. Despite her popularity, to the point that her image was used in at least two advertisements for student desks, she has appeared in only five film productions, two of which were made for television. When Baum produced a film version of the title story, he was not able to find a woman of athleticism suitable to play the role, and therefore cast the male French acrobat Pierre Couderc. She was portrayed by Doreen Tracy on the 4th Anniversary episode of Disneyland. Patchwork Girl appears in Return to Oz. She is seen in the background at Princess Ozma's coronation. On The Oz Kids, she was voiced by Lori Alan and had numerous infant patchwork kids. She also appeared in Walter Murch's Return to Oz as an unbilled extra. Thundertoad Animation's comparatively primitive CGI version from 2005 featured Cyndi Hotopp in the title role. There were at least two versions of the above-mentioned advertisement, a classroom poster issued by American Seating Company. They were not bootlegs and were authorized by the publishers. They include the statement \\"These quaint characters are quoted from the famous Oz books and were created by L. Frank Baum. Used by permission of Reilly and Lee Company, the publishers.\\" However this appears in very fine print and is easy to miss, especially on a small photo or reproduction of the poster. An earlier version of the poster is printed mostly in green and orange, a later version has more colors. A picture of a girl sitting at a desk in the lower right corner is also different in these two versions. Scraps stood alongside her friends when they rallied against a \\"new\\" Witch trying to obliterate the entirety of Oz in the comic book The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles. The Patchwork Girl also appeared in a leading role in the unaired television pilot Lost in Oz. In this version, her name is Serena and it is implied that she was once human. After her best friend became the new Wicked Witch of the West, she was literally ripped apart, but later repaired by an unknown person. The Witch also killed her family, and for this she has sworn vengeance against her former friend. Physically, she is very different from her book counterpart. She is extremely athletic, and looks like a pale human with dark hair, however after her outfit is damaged, it is revealed that she is made of fabric underneath. The actress also portrayed the best friend of the heroine, Alex, at the beginning of the episode, a nod to the 1939 film in which Dorothy's comrades were portrayed by her friends. In Emerald City Confidential, she owns a general store located next to Petra's office. She is also part of Frogman's smuggling ring. In Talking With..., the second monologue is about a housewife who dresses up as Scraps to escape her mundane life. Patchwork Girl is a supporting character in Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz, voiced by Jessica DiCicco. Just like the books, Scarecrow found her quite beautiful.

Regression analysis is an important part of mathematical statistics. Mathematical statistics is the application of probability theory, a branch of mathematics, to statistics, as opposed to techniques for collecting statistical data. Specific mathematical techniques which are used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure theory. Introduction Statistical data collection is concerned with the planning of studies, especially with the design of randomized experiments and with the planning of surveys using random sampling. The initial analysis of the data often follows the study protocol specified prior to the study being conducted. The data from a study can also be analyzed to consider secondary hypotheses inspired by the initial results, or to suggest new studies. A secondary analysis of the data from a planned study uses tools from data analysis, and the process of doing this is mathematical statistics. Data analysis is divided into: * descriptive statistics - the part of statistics that describes data, i.e. summarises the data and their typical properties. * inferential statistics - the part of statistics that draws conclusions from data (using some model for the data): For example, inferential statistics involves selecting a model for the data, checking whether the data fulfill the conditions of a particular model, and with quantifying the involved uncertainty (e.g. using confidence intervals). While the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies, they are also applied to other kinds of data. For example, from natural experiments and observational studies, in which case the inference is dependent on the model chosen by the statistician, and so subjective.Freedman, D.A. (2005) Statistical Models: Theory and Practice, Cambridge University Press. Topics The following are some of the important topics in mathematical statistics:Hogg, R. V., A. Craig, and J. W. McKean. \\"Intro to Mathematical Statistics.\\" (2005).Larsen, Richard J. and Marx, Morris L. \\"An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications\\" (2012). Prentice Hall. =Probability distributions= A probability distribution is a function that assigns a probability to each measurable subset of the possible outcomes of a random experiment, survey, or procedure of statistical inference. Examples are found in experiments whose sample space is non-numerical, where the distribution would be a categorical distribution; experiments whose sample space is encoded by discrete random variables, where the distribution can be specified by a probability mass function; and experiments with sample spaces encoded by continuous random variables, where the distribution can be specified by a probability density function. More complex experiments, such as those involving stochastic processes defined in continuous time, may demand the use of more general probability measures. A probability distribution can either be univariate or multivariate. A univariate distribution gives the probabilities of a single random variable taking on various alternative values; a multivariate distribution (a joint probability distribution) gives the probabilities of a random vector‚Äîa set of two or more random variables‚Äîtaking on various combinations of values. Important and commonly encountered univariate probability distributions include the binomial distribution, the hypergeometric distribution, and the normal distribution. The multivariate normal distribution is a commonly encountered multivariate distribution. Special distributions *Normal distribution, the most common continuous distribution *Bernoulli distribution, for the outcome of a single Bernoulli trial (e.g. success/failure, yes/no) *Binomial distribution, for the number of \\"positive occurrences\\" (e.g. successes, yes votes, etc.) given a fixed total number of independent occurrences *Negative binomial distribution, for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before a given number of successes occurs *Geometric distribution, for binomial-type observations but where the quantity of interest is the number of failures before the first success; a special case of the negative binomial distribution, where the number of successes is one. *Discrete uniform distribution, for a finite set of values (e.g. the outcome of a fair die) *Continuous uniform distribution, for continuously distributed values *Poisson distribution, for the number of occurrences of a Poisson-type event in a given period of time *Exponential distribution, for the time before the next Poisson-type event occurs *Gamma distribution, for the time before the next k Poisson-type events occur *Chi-squared distribution, the distribution of a sum of squared standard normal variables; useful e.g. for inference regarding the sample variance of normally distributed samples (see chi-squared test) *Student's t distribution, the distribution of the ratio of a standard normal variable and the square root of a scaled chi squared variable; useful for inference regarding the mean of normally distributed samples with unknown variance (see Student's t-test) *Beta distribution, for a single probability (real number between 0 and 1); conjugate to the Bernoulli distribution and binomial distribution =Statistical inference= Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions from data that are subject to random variation, for example, observational errors or sampling variation.Upton, G., Cook, I. (2008) Oxford Dictionary of Statistics, OUP. Initial requirements of such a system of procedures for inference and induction are that the system should produce reasonable answers when applied to well-defined situations and that it should be general enough to be applied across a range of situations. Inferential statistics are used to test hypotheses and make estimations using sample data. Whereas descriptive statistics describe a sample, inferential statistics infer predictions about a larger population that the sample represents. The outcome of statistical inference may be an answer to the question \\"what should be done next?\\", where this might be a decision about making further experiments or surveys, or about drawing a conclusion before implementing some organizational or governmental policy. For the most part, statistical inference makes propositions about populations, using data drawn from the population of interest via some form of random sampling. More generally, data about a random process is obtained from its observed behavior during a finite period of time. Given a parameter or hypothesis about which one wishes to make inference, statistical inference most often uses: * a statistical model of the random process that is supposed to generate the data, which is known when randomization has been used, and * a particular realization of the random process; i.e., a set of data. =Regression= In statistics, regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many ways for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables ‚Äì that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, the estimation target is a function of the independent variables called the regression function. In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the variation of the dependent variable around the regression function which can be described by a probability distribution. Many techniques for carrying out regression analysis have been developed. Familiar methods, such as linear regression, are parametric, in that the regression function is defined in terms of a finite number of unknown parameters that are estimated from the data (e.g. using ordinary least squares). Nonparametric regression refers to techniques that allow the regression function to lie in a specified set of functions, which may be infinite-dimensional. =Nonparametric statistics= Nonparametric statistics are values calculated from data in a way that is not based on parameterized families of probability distributions. They include both descriptive and inferential statistics. The typical parameters are the mean, variance, etc. Unlike parametric statistics, nonparametric statistics make no assumptions about the probability distributions of the variables being assessed. Non-parametric methods are widely used for studying populations that take on a ranked order (such as movie reviews receiving one to four stars). The use of non-parametric methods may be necessary when data have a ranking but no clear numerical interpretation, such as when assessing preferences. In terms of levels of measurement, non-parametric methods result in \\"ordinal\\" data. As non-parametric methods make fewer assumptions, their applicability is much wider than the corresponding parametric methods. In particular, they may be applied in situations where less is known about the application in question. Also, due to the reliance on fewer assumptions, non-parametric methods are more robust. Another justification for the use of non-parametric methods is simplicity. In certain cases, even when the use of parametric methods is justified, non-parametric methods may be easier to use. Due both to this simplicity and to their greater robustness, non-parametric methods are seen by some statisticians as leaving less room for improper use and misunderstanding. Statistics, mathematics, and mathematical statistics Mathematical statistics is a key subset of the discipline of statistics. Statistical theorists study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics, and statistical research often raises mathematical questions. Statistical theory relies on probability and decision theory. Mathematicians and statisticians like Gauss, Laplace, and C. S. Peirce used decision theory with probability distributions and loss functions (or utility functions). The decision-theoretic approach to statistical inference was reinvigorated by Abraham Wald and his successors, and makes extensive use of scientific computing, analysis, and optimization; for the design of experiments, statisticians use algebra and combinatorics.

He also won titles in Stampede Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Florida, Mid-South, Memphis and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation. He was part of the Hart wrestling family through marriage to his wife Elizabeth Hart, teaming with various members throughout his career, and appearing with his daughter Natalya Neidhart on the reality television show Total Divas.  Early life  At Newport Harbor High School, Neidhart first gained athletic acclaim for his success in strength-oriented track and field events. He held the California high school record in shot put from 1973 until 1985. After graduating from high school, Neidhart pursued a career in the National Football League (NFL), where he played for the Oakland Raiders and Dallas Cowboys in practices and preseason games.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (1979‚Äì1985) = Following his release from the Dallas Cowboys, Neidhart traveled to Calgary to train with Stu Hart and pursue a career in professional wrestling. He worked for Hart's Stampede Wrestling from 1978 to 1983, and again in 1985, during which time he married Ellie Hart, one of Stu's daughters. He was a two-time Stampede International Tag Team Champion, with Hercules Ayala in 1980 and Mr. Hito in 1983. Stu Hart, seeking publicity for Neidhart, promised him $500 to enter and win an anvil toss at the Calgary Stampede. He did, throwing it 11 feet, 2 inches. This earned him the nickname \\"The Anvil\\", replacing his prior nickname, \\"The Animal\\". Stampede had a working relationship with New Japan Pro Wrestling, and Neidhart worked on their Big Fight Series tour in 1982, the New Year Golden Series in 1983 and two shows on March 2 and 3, 1984. Neidhart teamed twice with King Kong Bundy for Georgia Championship Wrestling in 1983 and worked for Mid-South Wrestling from September till February 1984, where he and Butch Reed held the Mid-South Tag Team Championship for two and a half months. From April to August 1984, Neidhart worked for the Continental Wrestling Association. He then left for Championship Wrestling from Florida, winning their versions of the NWA Southern Heavyweight and NWA United States Tag Team Championship, before leaving for the WWF in January 1985. = World Wrestling Federation =  The Hart Foundation (1985‚Äì1991)  When Stu Hart sold Stampede Wrestling to Vince McMahon, owner of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Neidhart and Bret Hart were included in the deal. Initially a singles wrestler, managed by Mr. Fuji, Neidhart debuted on January 21, 1985, in Madison Square Garden, defeating Tony Garea. He wrestled Hart, who had a cowboy gimmick, to a draw twice. Bret, upset with his gimmick, suggested to McMahon that he form a tag team with Neidhart. \\"The Hart Foundation\\" Neidhart (back) and Bret Hart (front), The new team was dubbed The Hart Foundation and was managed by Jimmy Hart (no relation to Bret). They made their pay-per-view debut at WrestleMania 2, where they were the last two eliminated from a 20-man battle royal by Andr√© the Giant. The Hart Foundation won their first WWF World Tag Team Championship on the February 7, 1987 episode of WWF Superstars (taped January 26) from The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and The Dynamite Kid), with the help of referee Danny Davis, who was continually \\"distracted\\" by checking on Dynamite (laid out of the match early by a megaphone shot from Jimmy), allowing the challengers to double-team Smith. Davis was subsequently fired as referee and began wrestling, aligned with The Hart Foundation. They lost the titles on the November 7 episode of Prime Time Wrestling (taped October 27), to Strike Force (Rick Martel and Tito Santana). The Hart Foundation wrestled in another 20-man battle royal at WrestleMania IV. Bad News Brown attacked and eliminated Hart to win. Neidhart eventually joined Bret's side in the feud with Brown causing a rift between the team and manager Jimmy Hart. This led them to fire him and before starting a feud with The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers. In the fall of 1988, Jimmy Hart began managing the Rougeaus. The Hart Foundation unsuccessfully challenged Demolition (Ax and Smash) for the tag title at the 1988 SummerSlam, when Ax hit Hart with Jimmy Hart's megaphone for the pin (Hart accompanied Demolition's manager, Mr. Fuji, solely to further his feud with the challengers). The Hart Foundation continued feuding with Jimmy Hart's wrestlers for the next year, teaming with Jim Duggan to defeat Dino Bravo and The Rougeaus in a 2/3 falls match at the 1989 Royal Rumble, then defeating The Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine at WrestleMania V. In April 1989, both Hart Foundation members began wrestling singles matches at house shows. Neidhart also had a few shots at Ravishing Rick Rude's Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in August. The Hart Foundation reformed full-time on March 24 in Las Vegas. At WrestleMania VI in Toronto, they defeated The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov) in 19 seconds. They started a second feud with champions Demolition, who at this point added Crush. At SummerSlam 90 on August 27, The Hart Foundation won the title for a second time in a 2/3 falls match. On October 30, 1990, The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) defeated The Hart Foundation in a two out of three falls match in Fort Wayne, Indiana, to seemingly win the title. During the match, the top rope broke by accident, and the match did not air on television. The Rockers defended the WWF Tag Team title against Power and Glory (Paul Roma and Hercules) on November 3, 1990. Shortly after November 3, the WWF decided to not air the title change and that the title would revert to the Hart Foundation. In his book, Shawn Michaels claims that the Hart Foundation had politicked to keep the title. The WWF has never officially recognized The Rockers' reign. The Hart Foundation reigniting their feud with Jimmy Hart via his team, Rhythm and Blues (Honky Tonk and Valentine). Jimmy Hart once again cost The Hart Foundation the tag titles at WrestleMania VII, in a match with his new team, The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), when he distracted the referee, allowing Sags to knock out Neidhart with his motorcycle helmet. Hart and Neidhart again split up, though they reunited for a title rematch with The Nasty Boys on the July 29 Prime Time Wrestling, losing by disqualification when Bret hit both champions with a helmet, again introduced by Jimmy Hart. Neidhart also commentated on Wrestling Challenge alongside Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby Heenan from March until August 1991.  The New Foundation (1991‚Äì1992)  Neidhart returned to TV action on the November 9 edition of Superstars of Wrestling donning new parachute pants with checkerboard designs. He suffered a loss to Ric Flair, who continued to apply his figure-four leglock after winning the match, beginning a series of Flair vs. Neidhart matches that have continued into a second generation. While hobbling away to the back, he was attacked and further injured by The Beverly Brothers. He was thus replaced in the 1991 Survivor Series by Sgt. Slaughter (who became the team captain). Neidhart returned on the December 1 edition of Wrestling Challenge, teaming with Owen Hart (Bret's younger brother) as The New Foundation, defeating Barry Horowitz and Duane Gill. The New Foundation's highlight was a win over The Orient Express (Kato and Tanaka) at the 1992 Royal Rumble. The team also had matches with The Beverly Brothers, The Nasty Boys and The Natural Disasters throughout 1992 but had little success overall. Neidhart was fired on February 16, 1992 after refusing to take a drug test and throwing a television monitor backstage. = ECW, New Japan and WCW (1992‚Äì1995) = After three matches in Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW), Neidhart had three tours with New Japan Pro Wrestling in 1992: The G1 Climax in August (losing in the first round to Kensuke Sasaki), the Super Grade Tag League II in October (teaming with Tom Zenk and finishing with 0 points) and Battle Final in December. He also wrestled in Australia for Wrestling Down Under in March 1993 working three matches with Jake Roberts. He debuted for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) on the May 15 episode of WCW Worldwide, beating a jobber. After defeating another jobber on the next episode, Neidhart teamed with The Junkyard Dog for the next, again beating jobbers. Neidhart and The Junkyard Dog beat Paul Orndorff and Dick Slater by disqualification on the June 5 WCW Saturday Night. Eleven days later, he beat Shanghai Pierce in a dark match before Clash of the Champions XXIII. After losing to Maxx Payne at a house show in Kokomo, Indiana, on October 7, Neidhart left WCW. On November 13, 1993, Neidhart wrestled The Sandman to a no contest at ECW's November to Remember in the ECW Arena. He returned to ECW where on April 28, 1995 lost to Marty Jannetty. The next night he lost to Ron Simmons. =Return to WWF (1994‚Äì1997)= Reunion with Owen Hart (1994‚Äì1995) Salvatore Sincere. Neidhart returned to the WWF at King of the Ring in 1994, as Bret Hart's cornerman for his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match defense against Intercontinental Champion Diesel. After Diesel hit Hart with his Jackknife finisher, Neidhart interfered to prevent the pin, and disqualifying Hart but allowing him to retain the title. After the match, Diesel and Shawn Michaels beat down Hart, and Neidhart didn't intervene. Later that night, Neidhart reappeared at ringside again during Owen Hart's King of the Ring tournament final against Razor Ramon. He attacked Razor outside the ring, behind the referee's back, before Neidhart throwing Razor back for Hart to elbow drop and pin to become \\"The King of Harts\\", turning heel for the first time since 1988. Owen had been feuding with Bret since the Royal Rumble. Neidhart, believing Bret had held Owen back from his potential, sided with Owen, and usually cornering him in matches through the summer. Neidhart claimed he'd only helped Bret keep the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at King of the Ring so Owen could take it from him. This opportunity came in a steel cage match at SummerSlam. Neidhart sat in the third row during the match, behind other Hart family members. After Bret won the match, Neidhart entered the cage, locked it and helped Owen beat him down, while the Hart family members tried to climb over it and save him. Neidhart joined Owen on Shawn Michaels' team, The Teamsters, to face Razor Ramon and The Bad Guys in an elimination match at Survivor Series. After they eliminated every Bad Guy except Razor, after Michaels inadvertently hit Diesel with the Sweet Chin Music. This caused an argument and the tag team partners split up, before Diesel chased Michaels down the aisle. As the other Teamsters tried to intervene, and all were counted out. Because Diesel and Michaels were WWF Tag Team Champions when they split, the title was vacated and a tournament held. Neidhart and Hart lost to The New Headshrinkers (Fatu and Sionne) in the first round on the December 31 Superstars, by disqualification. By the time it aired, Neidhart had left the WWF. Bret Hart wrote in his autobiography that the original plan was for Owen and Neidhart to win the tournament and the WWF Tag Team Championships but Neidhart was officially fired due to no-showing events. Owen wound up winning the WWF Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania XI with new partner Yokozuna and years later with fellow brother-in-law The British Bulldog. Who (1996) On the July 6, 1996 Superstars, he returned as the masked heel Who, a gimmick designed for commentators Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler to make \\"Who's on First?\\"-style jokes during his matches (most of which he lost). Who last appeared on TV in the \\"Bikini Beach Blast-Off\\" party on the SummerSlam pre-show. His last match was a win over Alex Porteau in Miami on September 12. Neidhart vs. Falcon Coperis UCW 1997 Neidhart wrestled for New York independent promotion Ultimate Championship Wrestling (UCW), against Tatanka, his brother-in-law Bruce Hart, King Kong Bundy and Marty Jannetty. The Hart Foundation reunion and departure (1997) Neidhart returned to the WWF on the April 28, 1997 episode of Raw is War, and attacking Stone Cold Steve Austin and reuniting with Bret and Owen Hart as part of the new Hart Foundation, a stable of Canadian sympathizers, also including Davey Boy Smith and Brian Pillman. On July 6 at In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede in Bret's hometown Calgary, The Hart Foundation defeated the American team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust and The Legion of Doom. Neidhart was part of Team Canada at Survivor Series in Montreal, teaming with The British Bulldog, Doug Furnas and Philip Lafon defeated Team USA Vader, Goldust, \\"Marvelous\\" Marc Mero and the debut of \\"The Lethal Weapon\\" Steve Blackman (Bulldog was the sole survivor, Neidhart was pinned by Vader). After Bret and Davey Boy Smith left the WWF on bad terms because of the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series. D-Generation X leader and WWF Champion Shawn Michaels offered Neidhart a spot in the group on the November 24 episode of Raw Is War. Neidhart accepted, only for it to be revealed as a setup as the group assaulted Neidhart at the end of the show. The following week on the December 1 episode of Raw is War, DX member Triple H defeated Neidhart. After the match, DX attacked Neidhart once again and spray- painted \\"WCW\\" on his back, and signifying him following Bret Hart to World Championship Wrestling. Sgt. Slaughter and Ken Shamrock saved him, before Slaughter and Shamrock attacked D-Generation X at the end of the show. After Raw is War, WWF announced that Neidhart was released from his WWF contract on December 2, 1997. =Return to WCW (1998)= In January 1998, Neidhart returned to World Championship Wrestling, where he formed a tag team with The British Bulldog, who also departed from the WWF following the infamous Montreal Screwjob. Although this was his first true big-money deal, they were rarely utilized by WCW and achieved little in-ring success. His final match for WCW was on the September 26 episode of WCW Saturday Night where Neidhart and The British Bulldog lost to Stevie Ray and Vincent. Neidhart was released from the company in October. =Semi-retirement (1999-2016)= Following his departure from WCW, Neidhart mostly retired from the ring and made sporadic appearances in independent shows. Notably, he was booked as Jake Roberts' singles opponent in the ill-fated Heroes of Wrestling event in October 1999. In 2000 he wrestled for a few appearances for Memphis Championship Wrestling. From 2000-2003 he wrestled in Canada for Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling, and Border City Wrestling. On January 17, 2003 he lost to Jim Duggan at Broder City's main event at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Canada. On September 23, 2006 he defeated Norman Smiley at the UXW Florida Debut show in Orlando. His last known match was on March 5, 2016 when he teamed with Koko B. Ware and Frankie The Pizza Guy as they defeated Nikolai Volkoff, Clay Dasher and Shawn Andrews at a BCW event in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.

She was a member of Group Two of the first British of submarines. Like all members of her class, she was built at Vickers Barrow-in-Furness. Design and construction The A-class was designed by Vickers as an improvement on the previous American designed Holland-class submarines, and were the first class of British-designed submarines. Four submarines, ‚Äì, were ordered as part of the 1902‚Äì1903 construction programme for the Royal Navy, with a further nine (A5‚Äì) ordered under the 1903‚Äì1904 programme. The design of the submarines was revised between the prototype boat, A1, and the other three submarines of the first order, and again for the submarines of the 1903‚Äì04 programme, with this batch being fitted with a second torpedo tube. A5 was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of when surfaced. Displacement was about surfaced and submerged. A 16-cylinder Wolsey petrol engine powered the submarine on the surface, driving the submarine's single propeller shaft, while submerged propulsion was via a electric motor, giving a speed of on the surface and dived. Armament was two 18 inch (45.7 cm) torpedo tubes in the ship's bow. Four torpedoes were carried. A5 was laid down at Vicker's Barrow-in-Furness shipyard in 1903, was launched on 3 March 1904 and completed on 11 February 1905. Service history Immediately after commissioning she and her tender travelled to Queenstown, (now Cobh) Ireland. On 16 February 1905 at 10:05 whilst tied up alongside Hazard an explosion occurred on board, with a second explosion about 30 minutes later. Six of the crew were killed by the explosion. The captain, Lieutenant H G J Good, and the other four crew members survived. An enquiry into the accident concluded that petrol fumes had been ignited by an electrical spark, with the second explosion caused by smouldering debris from the first event. She was returned to Barrow-in-Furness the following month for repairs and returned to service in the Home Fleet in October. She was used for training until paid off for disposal in December 1915 and was finally broken up in Portsmouth in 1920. Memorial The Irish Naval Service donated a granite block with a brass plaque giving details of the A5 tragedy, and this was unveiled in March 2000. On 13 February 2005 there was a ceremony to mark the centenary of the accident. of the Irish Naval Service and of the Royal Navy visited Cobh for the occasion.

Reign According to Adam of Bremen, a certain King Ring ruled the Swedes together with his sons Erik and Emund in about 936.Adam av Bremen (1984), Historien om Hamburgstiftet och dess biskopar. Stockholm: Proprius f√∂rlag, p. 60 (Book I, Chapter 61) In a later chapter, Adam mentions Emund Eriksson as ruling Sweden some time in the second half of the 10th century. He was presumably the son of Erik Ringsson. Adam relates that Emund was king at the same time as King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark (c. 958-987) expanded his power overseas and subdued Norway (in about 970). Emund was an ally of Harald, and showed a friendly attitude to Christian people who came to him.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 81 (Book II, Chapter 25). That German missionary efforts were renewed about this time is related by Adam in the following chapter. The Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, Adaldag (937-988), appointed a Dane called Odinkar the Elder for the Swedish lands. Being a pious man of noble stock, he could \\"easily convince the wild peoples about everything concerning our religion\\".Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 82 (Book II, Chapter 26). Dynastic position Emund Eriksson is not known to the later Norse sagas and king-lists. Information about him may have come from Adam's interview with the Danish King Sweyn Estridsen, Harald Bluetooth's great-grandson.Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 266. To the extent that he is historical, he may have ruled in the third quarter of the 10th century. The next Swedish king mentioned by Adam of Bremen is Eric the Victorious (died c. 995), but he does not tell how they were related. It has even been speculated that Eric the Victorious belonged to a Geatic clan which gained power in the M√§laren Valley and founded Sigtuna in c. 980.Niels Lund (1995), \\"Scandinavia c. 700-1066\\", in Cambridge Medieval History Vol. II. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 202-27. Nevertheless, the name Emund was common in the late Viking Age dynasty of Sweden, but extremely rare outside of it, which suggests a dynastic continuity. An option is that Emund Eriksson was the brother of Bj√∂rn (III) Eriksson, who the Norse sagas name as the son of Eric Anundsson and the father of Eric the Victorious. This would have been in accordance with the Germanic system of co-rulership (Diarchy) in which two brothers were elected kings and which, according to the sagas, was sometimes used by the Swedes. If this is the case, several generations of Swedish rulers were conflated by tradition, explaining the differences between Adam of Bremen and the Norse sagas.

Widely recognized flags associated with Earth include the flag of the United Nations. Listed below are some of the most commonly recognized flags of Earth: United Nations flag The Flag of the United Nations Adopted in 1946, the flag of the United Nations has been used to indicate world unity, although it technically only represents the United Nations itself. It has a geographical representation of the planet, and its high visibility usage makes it a well-known contender for representing Earth. During the planning for NASA's Moon landings of the 1960s, it was suggested that a UN flag be used in place of the flag of the US.https://www.wired.co.uk/article/alternative-world-flags  Other private proposals  =John McConnell's flag= McConnell's original 1969 design Designed by John McConnell in 1969, the Earth flag's dark blue represents the atmosphere, while the white represents the clouds, and the light blue represents the oceans.https://www.wired.co.uk/article/alternative-world-flags McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration. Because of the political views of its creator and its having become a symbol of Earth Day, the flag is associated with environmental awareness, and the celebration of the global community. The Blue Marble image was placed in the public domain, and the public nature of this image was the basis of a legal battle that resulted in the invalidation of a trademark and copyright that was originally issued to the Earth Day flag through its original promotional entity, World Equity, Inc. This does not invalidate the official history of McConnell's flag, only the official documentation that was issued on it. =James W. Cadle's flag= Flag of Earth by James Cadle In 1970, James W. Cadle, a farmer from Homer, Illinois, created his own version of a flag of Earth. Cadle's flag consists of a blue circle representing Earth in the center of the flag, a segment of a large yellow circle representing the Sun and a small white circle for the Moon, all on a black background. It is particularly popular among SETI researchers and is used by the SETI League. The flag flies at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory and was lowered to half mast when Carl Sagan died. Flag of Earth Co. International, which sold the flag, was also founded by Cadle.
