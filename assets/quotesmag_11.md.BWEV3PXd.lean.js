She also edited the proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research from 1899 to 1916. Life The daughter of William Henry Farthing Johnson, a private school master, and Harriet Brimsley, she was born in Cambridge. Her brother was the logician William Ernest Johnson. She was educated in Cambridge and Dover, entering Newnham College in 1878. In 1881, she was placed in the equivalent of the First Class of the Natural Sciences Tripos (at that time, as a woman, she was not permitted to earn a degree). She was the first director of the Balfour Biological Laboratory for Women. From 1884 to 1890 Johnson was also a demonstrator in animal morphology at the laboratory. She continued her studies with Francis Balfour and, after Balfour's death in 1882, with Adam Sedgwick. Her research included studies of the early development of the newt. In 1884, she published the first paper by a woman to appear in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. She also published a study on the development of cranial nerves in the newt embryo with Lilian Sheldon, then a student at Newnham College. In 1890, she became private secretary to Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick, a leading figure in the Society for Psychical Research. Johnson was secretary for the Society from 1903 to 1907 and was its research officer from 1907 to 1916. She assisted in the so-called \\"Brighton experiments\\" in thought transference. Johnson also worked for the Society on the Census of Hallucinations. She prepared the work Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death by Frederic W. H. Myers for publication; it had been left uncompleted after Myers' death. Johnson resigned from the SPR in 1917.Anonymous. (1923). Annual Report of the Council. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 21: 30-31. \\"It will be remembered that since the resignation of Miss Alice Johnson in 1917 the Society had had no salaried Research Officer. It was decided, therefore, to fill this post, and Mr. E. J. Dingwall was appointed, and entered upon his duties in February immediately upon his return from America, where he had been working with Dr. Walter Prince.\\" Eleanor Sidgwick became principal for Newnham College in 1892 and Johnson served as her secretary until 1903. From 1893 to 1902, Johnson was also an associate of the college. She died in Cambridge at the age of 79. Publications *Johnson, Alice. (1908).

The road goes from Keighley to Wakefield on a rough north west/south east axis for 25 miles (40 km). The route is mostly single carriageway with some dualled sections in the Aire Valley, Bradford and the approach to Wakefield from the M1. Two sections of the A650 are designated as part of the Governments High Load Route; the section between Keighley and Saltaire and the section between the A58 on the Drighlington bypass and the Tingley roundabout.  Settlements on the route  * Keighley * Crossflatts * Bingley * Saltaire * Shipley * Bradford * Dudley Hill * Tong Street * Gildersome Street * Bruntcliffe * Morley * Tingley * East Ardsley * Carr Gate * Wakefield  Route description  The road begins at a roundabout with the A629 Skipton to Rotherham road in Keighley. The B6265 road (which was formerly the A629 until the bypass to Skipton was opened) also filters into the roundabout. The road heads south along the edge of Keighley town centre and is single carriageway until it intersects with the A6035 spur road heading south through the town. The road then becomes dual carriageway and arrives very quickly at the next roundabout with local roads in the Aireworth suburb of Keighley. Hereafter the road is travelling in a south easterly direction through the Aire Valley towards Bingley. The route here has blue measured mile signs so that drivers can test their vehicles and odometers. The next roundabout is at Crossflatts before the road heads into Bingley and instead of bypassing the town, it goes through the very centre at the lowest point in the valley, before intersecting with the old A650 route at the Bankfield roundabout in Cottingley. The road carries on through Nab Wood (where the eastbound side has a bus lane) to emerge at the improved roundabout at Saltaire and the junction with the A657. The road then carries on in a southerly direction through Saltaire village which merges seamlessly into Shipley town. Where the A6038 leaves the road at an acute angle of 45¬∞ to the east is known as \\"The Branch\\". The adjacent pub called The Branch was purchased by Bradford Council in 2018 to allow for its demolition in a ¬£42 million scheme to improve the junction. The A650 road continues into Bradford, again with a bus lane on the southbound side (IE towards Bradford). The road loses its Primary Route designation at the junction with A6177 (the outer ring road around Bradford) and then continues into Bradford and heads east at the junction with the A6181 and then south, where it meets the A6037 on a sharp 90¬∞ junction. It then functions as the inner ring road in Bradford, intersecting with the A658 and the A647 before leaving south eastwards with three lanes. It meets the A6177 again and regains its Primary Route designation but after the junction the route becomes single carriageway again. At Tong cemetery, the A651 leaves to the right hand side and the road heads east before going south again on the Drighlington bypass section where it intersects with the A58. At Gildersome roundabout the road has a multiplex junction with the M62, M621 and the A62. The road loses its Primary Route designation and intersects with the A643 and the A6029 before arriving at another multiplex junction (Tingley roundabout) with the A653 and the M62 motorway. The road continues eastwards with the A654 leaving to the left before it intersects with the M1 at junction 41. On the south side of the M1 the road reverts to dual carriageway towards Wakefield and it soon heads southwards where it intersects with the A61. The two roads run in tandem for before the A61 splits to the left. The A650 ends in Wakefield City Centre opposite the County Hall and adjacent to Wakefield College.  Bypasses  The A650 Aire Valley Trunk road in Bingley looking south. The canal was moved to the left in 1992 to allow the new road to be built. The A650 has had many improvements made to the road, including several bypasses. The Keighley to Crossflatts bypass section was opened in 1988 and the Crossflatts to Cottingley section (known as the Bingley Bypass) was opened in 2003. The old course is now the B6265 road. The inner ring road in Bradford and Drighlington have been bypassed too. The Drighlington bypass is built on the former trackbed of the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway line from Bradford to Wakefield via Morley and opened to traffic in February 1991. A section of the new road is built on what used to be a tip in the 1980s. The industrial waste was left under the new road and a revolutionary concrete composite was used to build on top of the tip. There are vents still to be seen at either side of the road to aid the removal of methane. Sections of the A650 between Tong and the M62/M621 junction cut across the historic battlefield site of Adwalton Moor.  Safety  In 2007, it was noted that of the seven worst accident blackspots in Leeds, four were on the A650 - Gildersome and Tingley Roundabouts, the Gelderd Road roundabout junction with the M62/M621 and the roundabout junction with the M1 at East Ardsley. The section of road that goes through the Bradford Metropolitan District (Keighley to Birstall) was recently highlighted as being the worst road in the area for accidents. Between 2010 and 2014, 542 accidents occurred on this stretch of road alone.

The war began in 1568 when Ayutthaya unsuccessfully attacked Phitsanulok, a Burmese vassal state. The event was followed by a Burmese intervention which resulted in the 2 August 1569 defeat of Ayutthaya, which became a Burmese vassal state. Burma then moved towards Lan Xang, occupying the country for a short period of time until retreating in 1570. Background In 1485, Mingyi Nyo usurped the throne of the Burmese kingdom of Toungoo after murdering his uncle. In the following years, Mingyi Nyo managed to retain the kingdom's independence while also leading several successful campaigns against Mon states. Toungoo also benefited from the collapse of the once-dominant Ava Kingdom, receiving numerous refugees from neighboring kingdoms that were unable to maintain the security of their citizens. In 1530, Tabinshwehti was crowned king of Toungoo following the death of his father. Tabinshwehti continued to expand his domain, overtaking Hanthawaddy and cementing Toungoo's status as an empire. Internal struggles over the control of the Ayutthayan (Siam) throne between the Suphannaphum Dynasty and the Uthong Dynasty culminated on 1546, after the death of King Chairacha. Chairacha's successor Yot Fa was killed in 1548, with conspirator Khun Chinnarat taking the throne. 42 days later Chinnarat was assassinated by nobles loyal to the Suphannaphum Dynasty, who installed Chairacha's relative as King Maha Chakkraphat. Tabinshwehti exploited the internal turmoil in Ayutthaya by instigating the first conflict between the two countries. The Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War (1547‚Äì49) resulted in the Burmese capture of the Upper Tenasserim coast down to Tavoy, while Ayutthaya managed to protect the rest of its territory. A second Burmese‚ÄìSiamese war erupted in 1563. Maha Chakkraphat's refusal to grant the Burmese king Bayinnaung with two white elephants served as the casus belli of the conflict. The Burmese first took Phitsanulok, Sawankhalok, Kamphaeng Phet, and Sukhothai thus turning them into tributary states, denying Ayutthaya valuable allies. Ayutthaya's capital was then sacked, while Maha Chakkraphat was forced to become a priest in Bago, Burma. However, he was soon allowed to return home on a pilgrimage during which he abandoned priesthood and returned to power. Conflict In 1568, Ayutthaya king Maha Chakkraphat requested King Setthathirath of Lan Xang to attack Phitsanulok, ploying to arrest its King Mahathammarachathirat. When Mahathammarachathirat asked Ayutthaya for assistance Maha Chakkraphat dispatched general Phya Siharat‚ÄìDejo, tasking him with detaining Mahathammarachathirat. Siharat‚ÄìDejo instead remained in Phitsanulok and disclosed Maha Chakkraphat's true intentions, pushing Burma into an armed intervention. A Burmese force broke through the Lao lines and joined the defenders of Phitsanulok which was besieged at the time. In the meantime, an Ayutthayan army advanced on Phitsanulok under the guise of reinforcements. Upon their arrival the Ayutthayans were asked to stay outside the city, on the same night the Phitsanulokans launched flaming rafts on the Ayutthayan fleet, destroying it. The losses prompted both the Lao and Ayutthayans to break the siege and retreat, the Lao troops later ambushed and annihilated a Burmese force that attempted to chase them. During the course of his retreat, Maha Chakkraphat unsuccessfully attacked Kamphaeng Phet. His plans changed however when he learned that was on an official visit to Burma, causing him to return to Phitsanulok. The Ayutthayans then proceeded to kidnap all of Mahathammarachathirat's family but his son Prince Naresuan who was accompanying his father. The kidnapping was to dissuade Phitsanulok from launching counter-attacks on Ayutthaya, nonetheless this act led the Burmese to initiate a joint invasion of Ayutthaya with the help of their Thai puppet states. Having gained the support of northern Thai states, Bayinnaung amassed an army consisting of 546,000 infantrymen and 53,000 in cavalry (Burmese sources say that Bayinnaung's five armies consisted of 54,600 men, 5300 horses, 530 elephants). The Burmese marched from the north until encountering a Lao army at the Pa Sak Valley near Phetchabun. The Lan Xang forces prevailed at which point one of the commanding generals from Nakhon Phanom broke south toward Ayutthaya. The Burmese rallied and were able to destroy the divided forces, and King Setthathirath had to retreat toward Vientiane. Siege of Ayutthaya and Vientiane The Burmese then laid siege to Ayutthaya city. After heavy cannon fire put a stop to Burmese attempts at digging up to the walls, the invaders began building a bridge at Koh Keo in order to access the walls from a new direction. Maha Chakkraphat died during the course of the siege, therefore his son Mahinthrathirat ascended the throne. Frequent Ayutthaya sorties once again prevented the Burmese from finishing the construction. Bayinnaung then sent an Ayutthayan noble he held captive under the guise of a deserter. Not only was the spy allowed into the city but he was also put into a position of power. On the night of 2 August 1569, the spy opened the gates of the city, bringing its downfall. Mahinthrathirat along with his family and the nobility were captured and taken to Pegu. Mahinthrathirat died on the way in the same year.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co. Ltd., Ayutthaya became a Burmese vassal state, with Mahathammarachathirat appointed king. The Burmese took several weeks to regroup and rest having taken Ayutthaya, which allowed Lan Xang to rally their forces and plan for prolonged guerrilla warfare. The Burmese arrived in Vientiane and were able to take the lightly defended city. Setthathirath began a guerrilla campaign from his base near Nam Ngum, northeast of Vientiane. In 1570 Bayinnaung retreated, Setthathirath counterattacked and more than 30,000 were taken prisoner, along with 100 elephants, and 2,300 pieces of ivory from the retreating Burmese.

Arthur was born in Adelaide, a member of the influential Whitington family. His father, William Smallpeice Whitington, came to South Australia in his own ship, the New Holland, loaded with merchandise including the colony's first thoroughbred stallion, arriving in July 1840. Arthur and several of his brothers were educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, and Arthur was early employed at BarnardSimeon Barnard (1844 ‚Äì 17 November 1923), auctioneer, was secretary of S.A.J.C.

In 1883 Parliament passed the Totalizator Repeal Act, which had the immediate effect of making race-courses much less profitable, and the old South Australian Jockey Club, whose finances were in a precarious state, was forced to relinquish the Morphettville racecourse to the Queensland Mortgage Company. The 1885 Adelaide Cup was, farcically, held at Flemington and the Club was defunct. In 1888 Whitington, who had previously had a supervisory role at race meetings, and whose employers John and William Pile were prominent racegoers, was approached by T. F. Wigley to help revive the Club, and Whitington convened a meeting in the arbitration room of the Stock Exchange in Pirie street on 19 September 1888, presided by Sir Richard Baker. The outcome of the meeting was that Whitington as Club Secretary, and a committee of seven (which included Sir Richard, W. B. \\"Ben\\" Rounsevell, T. F. Wigley and William Pile) were appointed, and the Morphettville course, which had been purchased by T. F. Wigley, Sylvester Browne, and R. B.

The racing editor of The Register wrote at the time: :\\"Without doubt this gentleman is the most suitable man in the colony to fill the office. He has a most thorough knowledge of the duties of a racing Secretary, while he also understands all the details connected with the working of the totalizator. Mr. Whitington ia not an extravagant manager by any means, and there is no fear of the new club incurring heavy liabilities at the outset of its career.\\" The writer proved correct: largely due to Whitington's scrupulous management, the SAJC was able in 1895 to exercise its \\"right to purchase\\" from Browne, who had in the interim acquired Pell's then Wigley's shares. Whitington had few interests outside his involvement with horse racing apart from canary breeding and his family, who lived for many years at Glenelg; he was married with four daughters and two sons.

A dotted motif is first played by cellos and basses, connects introduction and the Allegro in sonata form, is part of the main theme and dominates as an ostinato part of the development. The second movement is in song form. A motif of a downward tritone appears in a theme played first by the oboe, also in the first entrance of the cello which resembles improvisation, and in the cello's following cantilena. The movement is subdued and shaped by solo wind lines. The last movement plays with the rondo form. An energetic first theme contrasts to a lyrical episode. According to the publisher, the composer shared the musical material between the soloist and the orchestra as equal partners, with concertante parts especially for the winds. The duration is given as 30 minutes.

There are two described species placed into the genus, Cephalopone grandis and Cephalopone potens. Cephalopone is one several Lutetian Ponerinae genera. History and classification When described, Cephalopone was known from three fossil insects which are compression-impression fossils preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the Cephalopone specimens were collected from layers of the Lutetian Messel pit World Heritage Site. The formation is composed of brown coals, oil shales, and bituminous shale, which preserved numerous insects, fish, birds, reptiles, and terrestrial mammals as a notable lagerst√§tten. The area is a preserved maar lake which initially formed approximately 47 million years ago as the result of volcanic explosions. At the time of description, the holotype and paratype specimens were preserved in the Senckenberg Research Station Messel fossil collections. The fossils were described by Gennady Dlussky and Sonja Wedmann in a 2012 paper on the poneromorph ants of Messel, with the genus and both species named in it. The genus name is a combination of the ant genus Ponera and the Greek word cephale, meaning head. The specific epithet \\"grandis\\" is derived from the Latin meaning \\"strong,\\" while the name \\"potens\\" is based on the Latin meaning \\"strong\\" or \\"powerful\\". Cephalopone is one of five extinct genera from three subfamilies which have species described from Messel Formation fossils by Dlussky and Wedmann in 2012. Three of the other genera Cyrtopone, Messelepone, and Protopone are also placed in Ponerinae. The genus Casaleia is placed in Amblyoponinae, while the last genus Pseudectatomma is in Ectatomminae. Description The Cephalopone queens from Messel are described as large, having approximate body lengths ranging over . Species have heads that are up to, but no longer than 1.5 times the length of the mesosoma. The subtriangular mandibles are large, being over 80% of the length of the head, and have nine to ten teeth on the chewing faces. Like Protopone species, the antennae sockets are widely placed on the head, in contrast to those seen in Pachycondyla which are close together. On both the hind and middle tibiae there are a pair of spurs, one simple and one pectinate. The petiole is rounded with a helcium that projects of the front face of the gasteral segment. =C. grandis= C. potens C. grandis is known from a single fossil, consisting of a winged gyne preserved with the top of the body showing in the fossil. The body has an approximate length of with a squared off head that has slightly bulged back margin with rounded corners on each side. The clypeus has a slight downward cure along its front edge and bears a pair of protrusions on the lateral edges. The antennae have segments that range from 1.2 to 2 times as long as they are wide, with a scape is slightly extending past the back edge of the head. The large mandibles are about 87% of the head length and each one has ten teeth. The two teeth at the ends of the mandibles are both large, while the remaining teeth alternate between large and small. =C. potens= Two specimens were used to describe C. potens, both of mostly complete winged queens preserved as dorsal impressions. The body length of the queens is between with a square shaped petiole and a mesosoma that is 1.5-1.6 times longer than the head. The small eyes are placed just to the front of the heads midpoint. The clypeus is rounded on it front edge and the antennae have a scape which reaches the back edge of the head. The mandibles are approximately the length of the head, subtriangular in shape, and have nine teeth alternating between large and small.

The title was released on 21 October 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux systems. A port for Xbox One was released on 8 August 2016, the ports for iOS and Android were released on 31 January 2017, and the ports for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 were released on 14 September 2017 and 16 January 2018 respectively. A reworked version of the game, titled Kingdom: New Lands, was released in August 2016, and a sequel, Kingdom: Two Crowns, was released in 2018. The game is played out on a pixel art-based two-dimensional landscape; the player controls a king or queen that rides back and forth, collecting coins and using those coins to spend on various resources, such as hiring soldiers and weaponsmiths, building defenses against creatures that can attack and steal the king or queen's crown which will end the game, and otherwise expanding their kingdom. The player has otherwise little direct control of the game, and thus must use the coins they collect in judicious ways. Kingdom received generally positive reviews appreciating the game's art and music, and its approach that required the players to figure out what to do based on these elements, but felt that the tedious nature of some tasks in the game affected its end-game and replayability. Gameplay Kingdom is presented to the player in a pixel art, two-dimensional screen, with the goal to build up and create a kingdom while surviving various foes that will attempt to capture the player-character's crown, effectively ending their rule. The player starts the game with a randomly generated king or queen on horseback. The player can move the character on horse to the left or right, including at a gallop, but has no other direct action. As the character passes landmarks, these will produce a few coins, from which the player can pick up by riding over them, and spend on various resources, which will be marked with open coin slots when the character passes near them; to purchase an upgrade, the player must be able to provide all the required coins at that time. Initially, such resources will include hiring wandering travelers (vagrants) to become part of the kingdom and creating smiths to craft weapons and tools. As the player gathers more resources, new options to spend coins will open up. For example, once the player has a citizen of the kingdom with a tool, they can build defensive walls. Many such resources include upgrades that can be purchased with coins. To get more coins, the player roams their kingdom, collecting them from their subjects; static landmarks can grant more coins, as well as working people who fund the player after they complete certain tasks independently (such as farming or hunting game). While exploration of the kingdom can lead to finding more coins and potential resources, the areas away from the main kingdom center can become more dangerous for both the player-character and any followers; further, the game has a day-and-night cycle in which more harmful creatures can roam the kingdom at night, with subsequent nights becoming more and more dangerous. Other nights may have blood moons, which will cause much larger hordes of creatures to appear. These creatures will work to destroy existing resources that the player has created, steal gold from the player- character, and if the player-character has no gold, steal their crown, which represents failure in the game from which the player will need to restart the game. The player is encouraged to manage the construction of defenses and guards to manage those defenses against the need to expand and improve the kingdom. There is an ultimate goal to achieve victory, though the player must come to determine that for themselves. Development Kingdom was developed by the two-man team of Thomas van den Berg and Marco Bancale, who go by the aliases noio and Licorice, respectively. The game is an expanded, standalone version of a Flash game by noio. The development of the game was supported by Raw Fury, a Sweden-based publisher launched by former members of Paradox Interactive and EA DICE. In May 2019, Raw Fury acquired the rights to the series from van de Berg, allowing the publisher to continue development. In mid-2016, Raw Fury announced Kingdom: New Lands, an expansion to the original game. New content will be added to the game that will address some of the repetitive aspects critics found on the game's original release, such as adding new lands to be explored and a seasonal climate system that affects gameplay. The expansion released on 9 August 2016, with owners of the original game able to update for free. Within one day of its Windows, OS X, and Linux release, Raw Fury announced that it had sold enough copies to pay for the game's development. As a result, they affirmed that they will be releasing the title for the Xbox One, and that all future improvements and expansions to the game will remain free to players on the forementioned platforms. The team also later announced plans for a port to the Nintendo Switch. Mobile versions of the game, including the \\"New Lands\\" additions, for iOS and NVIDIA Shield devices were released circa March 2017. Reception Kingdom has received generally favorable reviews. Dan Stapleton of IGN gave the title a 7.7 out of 10, and felt the lack of instruction combined with the tension of the various random attacks created a great experience for the game. Robert Purchase of Eurogamer gave the game a \\"Recommended\\" rating, believing the game achieved the right balance between being fair to the player while the player learns the mechanics of the game. James Davenport of PC Gamer, giving the game a 70 out of 100, was more critical of the lack of instruction, noting that a half- hour's worth of gameplay investment could be wiped away due to the player not being aware of how certain mechanics work, and that the game would be one to test a player's patience. Reviewers praised the game's retro pixel art look and its chiptune soundtrack, which created the appropriate atmosphere for the title and provided appropriate visual and audible clues as events in the game for the player to pick up on. Reviewers commented that once the player understood the mechanics, the end-game and subsequent replays could become tedious. Stapleton found that the lack of information or means to manage the kingdom at the end-game made the end game more frustrating than difficult, and that once he had found a strategy to deal with the attacks, the game became too easy to play. Davenport commented that while the late game can be exciting on subsequent playthroughs, the early game of setting up the initial kingdom can become monotonous. Kingdom was nominated for the Excellence in Design award for the 2016 Independent Games Festival. The Kingdom games have sold over 4 million copies by May 2019.

It is named after its alleged leader, Jos√© Antonio Aponte.  Precedents  Due to the increase in use of slavery in Cuban society in the beginning of the 19th century, looking to secure the place left by Haiti as the major producer of sugar in the world, there were a series of conspiratorial attempts organized to abolish slavery. One that stood out among these occurred in 1795, where the first abolitionist conspiracy was discovered in Bayamo headed by the freedman Nicol√°s Morales, who when accused, fled and hid himself in Yareyal, near Holgu√≠n.  Conspiracy  In the year 1808, Napoleon's invasion of Spain and the arrival of falsehoods around the theme of slavery caused a risky resolution on behalf of the creoles in favor of abolition. Then in 1811, in Havana, a new abolitionist conspiracy was created by the freedman Jos√© Antonio Aponte and his reaches spread all the way to Sancti Sp√≠ritus, Trinidad, Camag√ºey, Bayamo, Holgu√≠n and Santiago in Cuba. The person who tied the western conspiracy to the eastern part of the country was Hilario Herrera, a brave Dominican mulatto with a deeply anti-slavery consciousness and an excellent clandestine organizer. On 11 March 1812, when the plot had exploded in Camag√ºey, Bayamo denounced the existence of a conspiratorial group in Holgu√≠n. As a result of the investigation, more than 50 people were apprehended and at the end of the trial, the local leader was sentenced to death by hanging, a man by the name of Juan Nepomuceo who originally came from the Congo. His companions Federico, Antonio, Miguel and Manuel were all given life sentences.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Andrew Fisher, 1899 Andrew Fisher's Cottage was erected and is a simple timber structure, representative of many other miner's house in the district. Originally located in Maori Lane at Red Hill, Gympie, it was relocated to is current site in 1972. The house was owned by the family of Andrew Fisher's wife, Margaret Irvine, and Andrew and Margaret Fisher are thought to have resided in the house for a short period after their marriage in 1901. Fisher met Margaret whilst residing at her family home in Crown Street, Gympie. Andrew Fisher was the first Queenslander to become Prime Minister of Australia. Having worked in mines in his birthplace of Ayrshire, Scotland since the age of ten, he arrived in Queensland in 1885. He was previously involved in miner's unions in Scotland where he was blacklisted for his association with the 1881 miners strikes. He continued his association with unions and the Labour movement in Queensland, becoming secretary and then president of the Gympie Branch of the Amalgamated Miner's Association. His foray into politics began with his election to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1893, followed by his election to the Australian House of Representatives in the first parliament of the Federation of Australia. He was appointed as Prime Minister after Alfred Deakin's resignation in 1908. He was re-elected in 1910 and it was during this term that he passed many influential bills and established the Commonwealth Bank. By the time Fisher arrived in Gympie in the late 1880s, it was a well established town. Gold had been discovered in the area by James Nash in 1867, providing the impetus for a rush of prospectors to the area. By 1869, Gympie had a population of many thousands and had been established so rapidly that by the time the official surveyors arrived in 1868, a substantial amount of the town had already been laid out.  Description  Andrew Fisher's Cottage is located within the Gympie and District Historical Society Mining Museum. It sits adjacent to other buildings also relocated to the site, including school buildings and those associated with mining and farming. The cottage is a typical four room single skin timber dwelling with exposed studs externally. It has a verandah with new balustrading to the south-west and south-east elevations and the roof has been re-clad with new corrugated iron. The cottage has been re-painted internally and externally, the internal finish appearing to imitate the wood grain. Entrance to the cottage is from the rear, either into the house itself or via a ramp onto the verandah. Internally, all walls on either side of the central hallway have been replaced with aluminium framed glass sliding doors which allow observation of the four rooms. Each of these rooms contain large collections of early furnishings.  Heritage listing  Andrew Fisher's Cottage was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Andrew Fisher was a Gympie miner whose involvement in the mining unions led to a political career culminating in him becoming the first Queenslander to serve as Prime Minister of Australia. Andrew Fisher's Cottage was owned by Fisher's wife's family, the Irvines. The Fishers reputedly stayed in the house for a short period after their marriage. The cottage was moved to the site of the Gympie and District Historical Society Mining Museum in 1972 and has special association with that group. The Historical Society have carried out extensive renovations on the cottage and value it as a significant part of their historical village.

Biography  While still very young, he demonstrated his artistic abilities by copying religious works and making sketches of people in ceremonial costumes; worn during processions. His drawing master asked him to reproduce an image of Saint Anthony, made by Fra Filippo Lippi in 1498. On the basis of this, he was able to obtain a scholarship.Brief biography @ the Comune di Prato website. His formal studies began at a local school in Prato, operated by Alessandro Ferrarini (1815-1904).

He painted his first large-scale fresco at the Villa Guasti (belonging to the writer , a major patron) in 1864. He was active throughout the Provinces of Prato, Siena and Liguria. Most of his works are on religious themes. Notably at Siena Cathedral, where he created marble inlay paving stones for the floor of the Cathedral, to replace damaged ones that had originally been made by Domenico Beccafumi. These stones were part of a project that had begun in the 14th Century. It was completed by the end of the 16th century, but restoration and replacement work continued long after. His depiction of the death of Ahab was one of the last stones laid, in 1878. The floor is now kept covered and shown only once a year; generally for a few weeks in September. In addition to his paintings and restoration work, he wrote articles on art for various French and Italian magazines. He was also an active member of the Provincial committee devoted to the preservation of monuments and paintings.

The result can also be extended to quasigeodesics on a convex polyhedron. History and proof A triaxial ellipsoid and its three geodesics A geodesic, on a Riemannian surface, is a curve that is locally straight at each of its points. For instance, on the Euclidean plane the geodesics are lines, and on the surface of a sphere the geodesics are great circles. The shortest path in the surface between two points is always a geodesic, but other geodesics may exist as well. A geodesic is said to be a closed geodesic if it returns to its starting point and starting direction; in doing so it may cross itself multiple times. The theorem of the three geodesics says that for surfaces homeomorphic to the sphere, there exist at least three non-self-crossing closed geodesics. There may be more than three, for instance, the sphere itself has infinitely many. This result stems from the mathematics of ocean navigation, where the surface of the earth can be modeled accurately by an ellipsoid, and from the study of the geodesics on an ellipsoid, the shortest paths for ships to travel. In particular, a nearly-spherical triaxial ellipsoid has only three simple closed geodesics, its equators.. In 1905, Henri Poincar√© conjectured that every smooth surface topologically equivalent to a sphere likewise contains at least three simple closed geodesics,. and in 1929 Lazar Lyusternik and Lev Schnirelmann published a proof of the conjecture, which was later found to be flawed.. The proof was repaired by Hans Werner Ballmann in 1978.. One proof of this conjecture examines the homology of the space of smooth curves on the sphere, and uses the curve- shortening flow to find a simple closed geodesic that represents each of the three nontrivial homology classes of this space.. Generalizations A strengthened version of the theorem states that, on any Riemannian surface that is topologically a sphere, there necessarily exist three simple closed geodesics whose length is at most proportional to the diameter of the surface.. The number of closed geodesics of length at most L on a smooth topological sphere grows in proportion to L/log L, but not all such geodesics can be guaranteed to be simple.. On compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces, there are infinitely many simple closed geodesics, but only finitely many with a given length bound. They are encoded analytically by the Selberg zeta function. The growth rate of the number of simple closed geodesics, as a function of their length, was investigated by Maryam Mirzakhani., Non-smooth metrics It is also possible to define geodesics on some surfaces that are not smooth everywhere, such as convex polyhedra. The surface of a convex polyhedron has a metric that is locally Euclidean except at the vertices of the polyhedron, and a curve that avoids the vertices is a geodesic if it follows straight line segments within each face of the polyhedron and stays straight across each polyhedron edge that it crosses. Although some polyhedra have simple closed geodesics (for instance, the regular tetrahedron and disphenoids have infinitely many closed geodesics, all simple).. others do not. In particular, a simple closed geodesic of a convex polyhedron would necessarily bisect the total angular defect of the vertices, and almost all polyhedra do not have such bisectors. Nevertheless, the theorem of the three geodesics can be extended to convex polyhedra by considering quasigeodesics, curves that are geodesic except at the vertices of the polyhedra and that have angles less than on both sides at each vertex they cross. A version of the theorem of the three geodesics for convex polyhedra states that all polyhedra have at least three simple closed quasigeodesics; this can be proved by approximating the polyhedron by a smooth surface and applying the theorem of the three geodesics to this surface.. It is an open problem whether any of these quasigeodesics can be constructed in polynomial time...

Orsoy is a district of the Lower Rhine town of Rheinberg on the Rhine. The word Orsoy, pronounced Oschau means \\"horse pasture\\" (Rossaue). Orsoy itself was in the Middle Ages a powerful fortified town with high walls and four gates. Although much of the fortifications were destroyed in the Second World War, a gate tower and part of the moat remain today giving some indication of the scale of the fortifications. Although the remaining gate was refurbished in 1937.Heinz van de Linde: Die unendlich lange Egerstra√üe.

History  Teutons supplanted the Celtic inhabitants around Orsoy in 750BC and Ceesar invaded the area establishing Roman Rule in the 1st century BC. Orsoy was first founded as a Roman Villa on what was the frontier of the empire. By the 4th century a Roman Road and ferry crossing had been established at Orsoy. In 401AD the Romans withdraw from the area in the face of the Visigoths and the Franks followed close behind. In 1938 archaeologists uncovered 9 royal tombs from 500-630AD showing strong Scandinavian cultural input.Kurt B√∂hner, Die fr√§nkischen Gr√§ber von Orsoy, Kreis M√∂rs.

The earliest mention of the town is in a charter for nearby Hamborn Abbey in 1139.Theodor Josef Lacomblet: Urkundenbuch f√ºr die Geschichte des Niederrheins. D√ºsseldorf 1840-1858, vol.I, p222. Orsoy 1591It is then mentioned in a deed of Count Dietrich IV of Kleve of 1233. From 1238 to 1240, Orsoy was used as a River Toll Station for the count of Kleve. His heir Dietrich V of Cleves,(1260-1275)) granted it town status in 1263 or 1270. There was a fire in 1347 that left the city in ruins, so it was refounded on September 1, 1347 by Emperor Louis IV. Count Johann von Kleve remained the local lord, and the town was governed by 7 aldermen, although it was never granted market rights. A baliff was granted in 1364 and a grant of a mayor followed soon after. In 1438 Duke Adolf of Cleves had built a second castle and in 1452 records show a teacher (schoolmaster) hired by the town. The town moat was completed in 1461. Plan of town in 1650 The modern fortress was built 1565-1581 by Italian Johann Pasqualini Elder (Responsible for the construction of the second ring ) and funded by Duke William the Rich of Cleves. In 1586 the town was conquered by the Spaniards and destroyed. From 1632-1640 the city was under Dutch occupation and the rebuilt fortress was built in the old Dutch style and expanded by the third fixing ring. In 1666 Orsoy once again came under Brandenburg management, until 1672 when there was a period of French rule, when Louis XIV ordered demolition of large parts of the existing fortifications. In 1685 the first Rhine harbor in Orsoy is established. Rebuilding of the fort took place again in 1750. In the 18th century Orsoy was a site of a significant textile industry. But a fire in 1818 and the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) and the relocation of the Rhine customs duty office to Homberg in 1805 caused the economy to crash. 1819 town plan A recovery began in 1851 with the production of cigars, which remained a staple industry until the second world war. In 1935/36 the harbor basin was filled in to facilitate extension to the primary school and extend the river dike. In 1938 also Orsoyer Jews were expelled from the town and later deported. Towards the end of World War II, in March 1945, Orsoy was occupied by troops of the US Army. During the hostilities the steeple of the Catholic Church was shelled by German troops. The shelling was carried out from the opposite (right) bank of the Rhine. A destruction of the tower a possible use by enemy reconnaissance should be suppressed. Starting in 1956, missile engineer Berthold Seliger lived in Orsoy. He built a workshop and built here the rocket, which he launched from 1962 to 1964 in the Wadden area of Cuxhaven. The once thriving tobacco is no longer existent. A large former tobacco factory on S√ºdwall was converted in the 1990s to housing. The most important local supply facilities have been preserved over the years in Orsoy. There is a primary school, two kindergartens, several doctors, a nursing home, two bakeries, a pastry shop, a bank and several smaller shops. On January 1, 1972, the town was incorporated into the city of Rheinberg. The city Orsoy was added on 1 January 1975.Historisches Gemeindeverzeichnis f√ºr die Bundesrepublik Deutschland.

Background to the book The book was the result of Kennedy‚Äôs love of Mexican food, which she discovered when she moved to Mexico City to live with her husband, New York Times reporter Paul P. Kennedy in 1957. The couple moved to New York City by the end of 1965, with Paul dying in 1967 of cancer. To make a living, Kennedy began teaching Mexican cooking classes in her Upper West Side apartment, with the cuisine quite novel at the time. Although New York Times food writer Craig Claiborne once mentioned to her that she should write a Mexican cookbook and encouraged her cooking classes. The book began to come together after then-poetry editor at Harper and Row Fran McCullough took one of her classes and offered to be her editor. The two would eventually work on Kennedy‚Äôs first five cookbooks. Although Kennedy had been collecting recipes since her time in Mexico City, she decided to go to Mexico to do further research. This research, she believes, is what separates her from other cookbook writers is that she has taken the time and effort to explore Mexico and do field research on how the cuisine varies.

There was a plan to bring the BPL proportion in the total population down to 35%. Maoist activities Right from its inception in 2000. Jharkhand was a ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù for Naxalites to experiment with their ideas of establishing a parallel government. As of 2005, 16 of the 22 districts in the state, including Hazaribagh district, was transformed into a ‚Äúguerrilla zone‚Äù. The movement was not restricted to armed operations but included kangaroo courts called Jan adalats, elected village bodies and people's police. Jharkhand, with a dense forest cover over a large part of the state, offers a favourable terrain for the Naxalites to build their bases and operate. Annual fatalities in Jharkhand were 117 in 2003 and 150 in 2004. In 2013 Jharkhand was considered one of the two states in the country most affected by Left wing extremism and Jharkhand police set up an exclusive cell to deal with Maoist activities. However, in the same year, when Jharkhand police identified 13 focus areas for combating Maoist extremism, Hazaribagh district was not one of them. Geography Bishnugarh is located at .

It was built from to . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Scottish Gympie Gold Mine, No. 2 shaft, 1900 The lease occupied by the site was taken up in 1889 as the \\"No.1 Eastern\\" mine, forfeited and taken up as the No.3 Great Eastern mine in 1891, but went into liquidation soon thereafter. Gympie Goldmines (Eastern Monkland) Company was formed, and was sold to Scottish investors in 1895, becoming the Scottish Gympie Gold Mines Limited with its head office in Glasgow. By the following year the shaft was down , the deepest on the field. At this time companies started considering cyaniding their tailings dumps and the company increased the number of stampers in its battery by 50 in 1898. In 1904 the battery was reported to have 125 head of stamps and 394 men employed, and to be raising of ore for crushing each year, with an estimated ore reserve for another ten years. The company closed the mine in 1923 and in the following year a syndicate of 19 men was formed to purchase the lease over the shaft and winding gear, and mining recommenced intermittently. However the lease was relinquished in 1924 and an auction sale of machinery held. In 1927 W. Runge and O. Alexander took over the mine and battery site and established a cyaniding plant. The leases were held by the Runge family until taken over by the Gympie City Council. The mine was the most productive in the Gympie goldfield producing of gold from of ore between 1867 and 1923.  Description  The place consists of: * The standing assay office which has been conserved * Concrete foundations of the compressor room, engine room and secondary crushing equipment * A 4-head prospecting stamp battery * Engine foundations * Battery foundations * Very large in-ground water tank * Capped shaft, headframe foundations and foundations of the winding house.  Heritage listing  No. 1 Scottish Gympie Mine and Battery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The No.1 Scottish Gympie mine and battery is significant in the evolution and pattern of Queensland history because it was the most successful mine in the Gympie Goldfield, which had a major impact on Queensland's development and was a major example of the impact of overseas investment on the development of the State. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place is a rare aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage and contains the only readable evidence of historical mining activity in Gympie. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The place demonstrates, through surviving foundations and the intact assay office, the characteristics of a large-scale gold mining works and as such has the potential to provide information to increase our understanding of battery technology and management. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Significant as the most intact surviving example of mining remains in the Gympie field and probably the largest gold battery remains in Southeast Queensland.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines fatigue as \\"A physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss or extended wakefulness, circadian phase, or workload.\\" The phenomenon places great risk on the crew and passengers of an airplane because it significantly increases the chance of pilot error. Fatigue is particularly prevalent among pilots because of \\"unpredictable work hours, long duty periods, circadian disruption, and insufficient sleep\\". These factors can occur together to produce a combination of sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm effects, and 'time-on task' fatigue. Regulators attempt to mitigate fatigue by limiting the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly over varying periods of time.  Effect on flight safety  It has been estimated that 4-7% of civil aviation incidents and accidents can be attributed to fatigued pilots. \\"In the last 16 years, fatigue has been associated with 250 fatalities in air carrier accidents.\\" Robert Sumwalt, NTSB vice chairman, said at an FAA symposium in July. Symptoms associated with fatigue include slower reaction times, difficulty concentrating on tasks resulting in procedural mistakes, lapses in attention, inability to anticipate events, higher toleration for risk, forgetfulness, and reduced decision-making ability. The magnitude of these effects are correlated to the circadian rhythm and length of time awake. Performance is affected the most, when there is a combination of extended wakefulness and circadian influences. = Studies on the effects of fatigue = A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) study of 55 human-factor aviation accidents from 1978 to 1999, concluded accidents increased proportionally to the amount of time the captain had been on duty. The accident proportion relative to exposure proportion rose from 0.79 (1‚Äì3 hours on duty) to 5.62 ( more than 13 hours on duty). This means that \\"5.62% of human factors accidents occurred to pilots who had been on duty for 13 or more hours, where only 1% of pilot duty hours occur during that time.\\" In another study by Wilson,Caldwell and Russell, participants were given three different tasks that simulated the pilot's environment. The tasks included reacting to warning lights, managing simulated cockpit scenarios, and conducting a simulated UAV mission. The subjects' performance was tested in a well-rested state and again after being sleep deprived. In the tasks that were not as complex, such as reacting to warning lights and responding to automated alerts, it was found that there was a significant decrease in performance during the sleep deprived stage. The reaction times to warning lights increased from 1.5 to 2.5 seconds, and the number of errors doubled in the cockpit. However, tasks that were engaging and required more concentration were found to not be significantly affected by sleep deprivation. The study concluded that \\"...fatigue effects can produce impaired performance. The degree of performance impairment seems to be a function of the numbers of hours awake and the 'engagement' value of the task.\\" One United States Air Forces study found significant discrepancies regarding how fatigue affects different individuals. It tracked the performance of ten F-117 pilots on a high-fidelity flight simulator. The subjects were sleep deprived for 38 hours and their performance was monitored over the final 24 hours. After baseline correction, the systematic individual differences varied by 50% and concluded that fatigue's effect on performance varied drastically among individuals. Prevalence The first step to understanding the critical impact fatigue can have on flight safety is to quantify it within the airline environment. An airline's management often struggles to balance rest with duty periods because it strives for maximum crew productivity. However, fatigue comes as a limitation needing increasing consideration. A study by Reis et Al. investigated the prevalence of fatigue on a group of Portuguese airline pilots. 1500 active airline pilots who had all flown within the past six months received a questionnaire. Out of the population, 456 reliable responses were received. A pretest was conducted to determine the viability of the fatigue scale adopted during the test, called Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The purpose of the validation survey was to set a benchmark (i.e. FSS=4) on an acceptable level of fatigue for the Portuguese culture. The scale ranged from 1 meaning no fatigue to 7 being high. Participants had one month and a half to respond to the inquiry. Results on physical fatigue found that 93% of short/medium haul pilots scored higher than 4 on the FSS while 84% of long-haul pilots scored greater than 4. Mental fatigue found short/medium haul at 96% and long haul at 92%. The Questionnaire also asked: \\"Do you feel so tired that you shouldn‚Äôt be at the controls?\\". 13% of pilots said that this never happened. 51% of all participants said it happened a few times. Limitations of the study were: fatigue levels are subjective and research did not attempt to control the number of times pilots had available to respond to the questionnaires. Overall the study establishes that pilots are subject to high levels of fatigue on the job. Levels of fatigue collected were also compared with a validation test conducted on multiple sclerosis patients in Switzerland. These patients showed average fatigue levels of 4.6 while pilots in the Portuguese study scored an average of 5.3. Electroencephalogram probes monitoring physiological activity during a pilot fatigue study. High prevalence of fatigue was also revealed in a study by Jackson and Earl investigating prevalence among short haul pilots. The study consisted of a questionnaire that was posted on a website, Professional Pilot‚Äôs Rumour network (PPRUNE) and was able to obtain 162 respondents. Of the 162, all being short haul pilots, 75% were classified to have experienced severe fatigue. Based on questionnaire results, the study also demonstrated that pilots who were highly concerned about their level of fatigue during the flight often scored higher on the fatigue scale and thus were likely to experience more fatigue. Not only this, operational factors, for example a change in flights, or from flight into discretionary time often cause the pilot to experience greater fatigue. On the other hand, research by Samen, Wegmann, and Vejvoda investigated the variation of fatigue among long-haul pilots. 50 pilots all from German airlines participated in the research. As participants, pilots were subject to physiological measures pre-departure and during flight and filled out routine logs recording their times of sleep and awakening. Pilots also completed two questionnaires. The first reflecting feelings of fatigue before and after the flight, recorded before departure, 1-hour intervals during the flight and then immediately after landing. The second questionnaire was the NASA task load index. The second questionnaire also administered during flight, assessed different dimensions including mental, physical and temporal demand as well as performance. Key findings from the study conveyed that: outgoing flights from the home base were rated as less stressful and night flights were rated as the most stressful. The physiological measures found that microsleeps recorded by the EEGs increased progressively with flight duty. Microsleeps are recordings of alpha wave activity and they occur during wakeful relaxation often resulting in loss of attention. They are considered microsleeps if they last less than thirty seconds. Microsleep cases for pilots on outgoing flights were half compared to the number on incoming flights back to the home base showing that fatigue is more prevalent on flights returning home. Pilots are more prone to microsleeps during the cruise phase of the flight while they are more alert and less likely to experience microsleeps during the take-off, approach and landing phases of the flight. Findings also show that fatigue was greater during night flights because pilots had already been awake for more than 12 hours and would begin duty by the time they were due to go to sleep. =Self-assessment= Pilots often have to rely on self-assessment in order to decide if they are fit to fly. The IMSAFE checklist is an example of self-assessment. Another measure that a pilot can employ to more accurately determine his level of fatigue is the Samn- Perelli Seven Point Fatigue Scale (SPS). The evaluation has a scale of 1-7, 1 described as ‚ÄúFully, Alert and Wide Awake‚Äù while 7 ‚ÄúCompletely exhausted, unable to function effectively‚Äù. All levels in between have descriptions aiding the pilot with his decision. Another example of self- assessment is simply a visual and analogue scale. The test is represented by a line with No Fatigue and Fatigue labeled on two ends. The pilot will then draw a mark where he feels to be. Advantages of self-assessment include that they are quick and easy to administer, can be added to routine checklists and being more descriptive allow pilot to make a better decision. Disadvantages include that it is easy for the pilot to cheat and are often hard to disprove. Between 2010 and 2012, more than 6.000 European pilots have been asked to self-assess the level of fatigue they are experiencing. These surveys revealed that well over 50% of the surveyed pilots experience fatigue as impairing their ability to perform well while on flight duty. The polls show that e.g. 92% of the pilots in Germany report they have felt too tired or unfit for duty while on flight deck at least once in the past three years. Yet, fearing disciplinary actions or stigmatization by the employer or colleagues, 70-80% of fatigued pilots would not file a fatigue report or declare to be unfit to fly. Only 20-30% will report unfit for duty or file a report under such an occurrence. Countermeasures Since the 1930s, airlines have been aware of the impact of fatigue on pilot's cognitive abilities and decision making. Nowadays prevalence of fatigue draws greater attention because of boom in air travel and because the problem can be addressed with new solutions and countermeasures. =In-flight strategies= * Cockpit napping: A forty-minute nap after a long period of wakefulness can be extremely beneficial. As demonstrated in the Rosekind study, pilots who took a forty-minute nap were much more alert during the last 90 minutes of the flight and they also responded better on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) showing faster response rates and fewer lapses. The control group who had not taken a nap showed lapses during the approach and landing phases of the flight. In-seat cockpit napping is a risk-management tool for controlling fatigue. The FAA still has not adopted the cockpit napping strategy, however it is being utilized by Airlines such as British Airways, Air Canada, Emirates, Air New Zealand, Qantas. * Activity breaks are another measure found to be most beneficial when a pilot is experiencing partial sleep loss or high levels of fatigue. High fatigue coincides with the circadian trough where the human body experiences its lowest body temperature. Studies demonstrated that sleepiness was significantly higher for fatigued pilots who had not taken any walking breaks. * Bunk sleeping is another effective in-flight strategy. Based on the time zone pilots take-off from, they can determine which times during the flight they will feel inadvertently drowsy. Humans usually feel drowsier mid- morning and then mid-afternoon. * In-flight rostering involves assigning the crew to specific tasks at specific times during the flight so that other members of the crew have time for activity breaks and bunk sleep. This allows well-rested crew members to be used during the critical phases of flight. Further research will need to show the optimal number of crew members sufficient for a well rested operating crew to operate the flight safely. * Proper cockpit lighting is paramount in reducing fatigue since it inhibits the production of melatonin. Studies have shown that simply increasing lighting level to 100-200 lux improves alertness in the cockpit. 100 lux level is the same as room lighting and, therefore, would not affect a pilot‚Äôs night vision. =Alternative strategies= * Although pilots are often given layovers with ample time to rest, the environment itself may not be favorable to achieve full recovery. The temperature may be too warm, the place noisy or the time zone change may not facilitate biological sleep. As a result, the use of over- the-counter drugs may be effective. Zolpidem is a well tested pharmaceutical compound with a half-life of two and a half hours and the drug is fully metabolized within 10 hours. It can be used to initiate sleep to help obtain a good rest. It must not be combined with any cockpit-naps. The drug also has no side effects, improving sleep quality without causing insomnia or any detrimental effects on next-day alertness. As pilots know, they must not have any amount of a drug present in their systems at the time they begin duty * Implementation of a personal checklist to rate fatigue before a flight can aid the decision of whether a pilot feels he is fit to fly. The Samn-Perelli checklist is a good measure with a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 meaning \\"fully alert\\" and 7 meaning \\"completely exhausted and unable to function.\\" * Implementation of fatigue prediction models, such as the Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness model, optimize scheduling by being able to predict pilot fatigue at any point in time. Although the mathematical model is limited by individual pilot differences it is the most accurate existing prediction because it takes into account time-zone changes, time awake, and length of previous rest. *Sleep and fatigue monitoring: Using wrist-worn sleep monitors to track sleep accurately. Traditionally, sleep is tracked through personal estimation which is inaccurate. With this technology, regulators could implement operating restrictions or cautions for pilots with less than eight hours of sleep in the previous 24 hours. *In early 2007, the 201 Airlift Squadron of the District of Columbia Air National Guard (ANG), successfully integrated the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool FAST into its daily scheduling operations. This integration required the full-time attention of two pilot schedulers, but yielded valuable risk mitigation data that could be used by planners and leaders to predict and adjust critical times of fatigue in the flight schedule. In August 2007, the Air National Guard Aviation Safety Division, under the direction of Lt Col Edward Vaughan, funded a project to improve the user interface of FAST, permitting daily use by pilot schedulers and integration with automated flight scheduling software. This improved, user-responsive interface, known as Flyawake (FlyAwake.org), was conceived and managed by Captain Lynn Lee and developed by Macrosystems. The project cited empirical data collected in combat and non-combat aviation operations, and challenged the U.S. government's established policies regarding fatigue as a factor in degrading human performance.http://www.SeeAndAvoid.org =Cockpit design= * Head-up display (HUDs) reduce the necessity of the pilot having to focus on the far runway and near instruments. The accommodation process is no longer needed, optimal in diminishing the onset of fatigue. * Blinking lights on aircraft avionics are extremely effective at capturing a pilot's attention, however, they contribute to fatigue. The maximum benefit is achieved by initially using blinking lights to capture the pilot's attention, but then displaying the message on a steadily lit background. =Further considerations= Aircraft are becoming increasingly automated, often resulting in the flight crew becoming complacent because of less direct involvement especially during the cruise phases of a long haul flight. Long legs in cruise may cause pilots to become bored, thus incrementing the prevalence of risk because it will take a pilot a longer time to resume full alertness in case of emergency. Airlines schedule two crews or a junior first officer as a strategy to combat boredom during the cruise phases of flight. \\"Keep Awake\\" routines are another countermeasure. They consist of small events in flight designed to start a false problem that has previously been inputted by a flight engineer. \\"Keep awake\\" routines do not affect flight safety and their purpose reattain the pilot's full alertness and undivided attention.  Regulations  National aviation regulators typically use the hours-of-service approach to prevent fatigue. The hours-of-service is usually measured by flight duty period which is defined as \\"a period which commences when a flight crew member is required to report for duty... and which finishes when the aircraft is parked with no intention of [further movement]\\". Limits are generally set on flight duty time across daily, weekly, and monthly time periods. These limits differ based on: what type of operation is being conducted, the time of day, and whether the flight is single-pilot or multi- pilot. There are also requirements for time free from duty after consecutive days on duty. All ICAO member states place some kind of operational limit, but there are differences in how this is done across nations. A survey of ten nations found that a total of twelve different operational factors were regulated, with each country regulating six factors on average. However, these factors are often measured in different ways and vary significantly in limit. Many experts in aviation safety find that the current regulations are inadequate in combating fatigue. They point to high prevalence rates and laboratory studies as evidence for the current systems failure. While the current system helps prevent extended sleep deprivation, it does not take into account circadian rhythm disruptions, time of day, or accumulated sleep debt. One study found that the findings show \\"a need to raise the level of knowledge within the industry regarding the causes and consequences of fatigue and of processes for its management\\". Accidents and incidents related to pilot fatigue American Airlines Flight 1420 crash in Little Rock, Arkansas *American International Airways Flight 808 was a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 that crashed short of the runway at NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on August 18, 1993. This is the first accident in history for which pilot fatigue was cited as the primary cause. *Korean Airlines Flight 801 was a Boeing 747 en route to Antonio Won Pat Airport which crashed into a hill three miles away from the runway. The accident killed 228 out of the 254 people on board, including the crew. The captain failed to brief the first officer on the approach procedure and descended below the minimum safe altitude. The captain's fatigue \\"...degraded his performance and contributed to his failure to properly execute the approach.\\" *On American Airlines Flight 1420 fatigue was found to be a contributing factor. Eleven people were killed when the McDonnell Douglas MD-82 crashed in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1999. *Corporate Airlines Flight 1566 crashed short of the runway on approach to Kirksville Regional Airport in 2004 after its fatigued pilots had been on their sixth consecutive day of flight and on duty for 14 hours that day. The NTSB found the accident was caused by the pilots' failure to follow established safety procedures, while conducting a non-precision approach in IMC and that \\"...their fatigue likely contributed to their degraded performance.\\" *Pilots operating Go! Airlines Flight 1002 in October 2008, a thirty-six-minute leg from Honolulu to Hilo, fell asleep and overshot their destination by 30 nautical miles. Subsequently, they woke up and landed the airplane safely. The day the incident occurred was the third consecutive day pilots started duty at 5:40 AM. * Colgan Air accident in the US in 2009, killing 50 people * Air India crash in 2010 (158 dead). * Pilot fatigue was identified as a probable contributor to the 2010 Afriqiyah Airways Flight 771 crash in an official report, published on 1 March 2013. The plane with 93 passengers and 11 crew members on board crashed during a go-around at Tripoli airport, killing everyone but one person on board.

It was completed in 1915 while the town was a part of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The church is dedicated to Our Lady of Kazan, probably the most venerated icon in Russia.  History  Church of Our Lady of Kazan was designed by the architect Nikolay Nikonov and raised for the Russian villa colony in Terijoki. During the Finnish period, it was the largest Eastern Orthodox church in Finland. As Terijoki was captured by the Soviet troops in 1939, the church served as a warehouse until the late 1970s. It was renovated in the 1980s and reconsecrated in 1990 by the Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow. Church of Our Lady of Kazan was preceded by the Orthodox church in Terijoki, which was completed in 1880 by the design of Fjodor Kharlamov. The Terijoki Church was funded by a wealthy St. Petersburg businessman Andrei Ivanovich Durdin who had a villa in Terijoki. As the population of the villa colony rose up to tens of thousands, the church was enlarged in 1894 by the drawings of J. F. Bruni. It was originally one of the churches of Raivola parish and the Terijoki parish was established in 1898. In December 1907 the wooden church in Terijoki was destroyed in a fire. The new church was raised a 500 metres west to the centers village of Terijoki, next to the 1907 completed Terijoki Lutheran Church.

Offering a blend of active and passive styles of management, a smart beta portfolio is low cost due to the systematic nature of its core philosophy - achieving efficiency by way of tracking an underlying index (e.g., MSCI World Ex US). Combining with optimization techniques traditionally used by active managers, the strategy aims at risk/return potentials that are more attractive than a plain vanilla active or passive product. Originally theorized by Harry Markowitz in his work on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), smart beta is a response to a question that forms the basis of MPT - how to best construct the optimally diversified portfolio. Smart beta answers this by allowing a portfolio to expand on the efficient frontier (post-cost) of active and passive. As a typical investor owns both the active and index fund, most would benefit from adding smart beta exposure to their portfolio in addition to their existing allocations.  Demand for smart beta  Smart beta strategies have generated considerable interest from institutional investors in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. According to ETF.com, as of April 2019 there was approximately $880 billion invested in smart beta funds. The increase in demand has led to an increase in the number of products and there are more than 1000 smart beta ETFs on the market today. The demand/growth does not appear to be slowing down; in the 12-month period ending February 2019 77 new smart beta ETFs launched accounting for roughly 1/3 of all ETFs launched in the 12 month period. According to Morningstar, there were 632 strategic-beta exchange traded products at the end of June 2020 with $869.7 billion in assets.  Product landscape  Asset managers including BlackRock, Legg Mason, Henderson Rowe, Invesco and WisdomTree all operate smart beta funds. To identify which type of smart beta provides the best fit, qualified institutional investors need to understand the expected return and risk for each of their active, passive, and smart beta allocations.

LGBT (also seen as LGBTQ) stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or queer. The LGBT community did not receive societal recognition until the historical marking of the Stonewall Riots in 1969 in New York at Stonewall Inn. The Stonewall riots brought domestic and global attention to the lesbian and gay community. Proceeding Stonewall, Romer v. Evans vastly impacted the trajectory of the LGBT community. Ruling in favor of Romer, Justice Kennedy asserted in the case commentary that Colorado's state constitutional amendment \\"bore no purpose other than to burden LGB persons\\". Advancements in public policy, social discourse, and public knowledge have assisted in the progression and coming out of many LGBT individuals. Statistics show an increase in accepting attitudes towards lesbians and gays among general society. A Gallup survey shows that acceptance rates went from 38% in 1992 to 52% in 2001. However, when looking at the LGBT community through a racial lens, the Black community lacks many of these advantages. Research and studies are limited for the Black LGBT community due to resistance towards coming out, as well as a lack of responses in surveys and research studies. The coming out rate of blacks is less than those of European (white) descent. The Black LGBT community refers to the African-American (Black) population who identify as LGBT, as a community of marginalized individuals who are further marginalized within their own community. Surveys and research have shown that 80% of African Americans say gays and lesbians endure discrimination compared to the 61% of whites. Black members of the community are not only seen as \\"other\\" due to their race, but also due to their sexuality, so they always had to combat racism and homophobia. History =Pre-Stonewall riot= Trans-woman Lucy Hicks Anderson, born Tobias Lawson in 1886 in Waddy, Kentucky, lived her life serving as a domestic worker in her teen years, eventually becoming a socialite and madame in Oxnard, California during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1945, she was tried in Ventura County for perjury and fraud for receiving spousal allotments from the military, as her dressing and presenting as a woman was considered masquerading. She lost this case but avoided a lengthy jail sentence, only to be tried again by the federal government shortly thereafter. She too lost this case, but she and her husband were sentenced to jail time. After serving their sentences, Lucy and her then husband, Ruben Anderson, relocated to Los Angeles, where they lived quietly until her death in 1954. Harlem Renaissance During the Harlem Renaissance, a subculture of LGBTQ African-American artists and entertainers emerged, including people like Alain Locke, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Wallace Thurman, Richard Bruce Nugent, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Moms Mabley, Mabel Hampton, Alberta Hunter, and Gladys Bentley. Places like Savoy Ballroom and the Rockland Palace hosted drag-ball extravaganzas with prizes awarded for the best costumes. Langston Hughes depicted the balls as \\"spectacles of color\\". George Chauncey, author of Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940, wrote that during this period \\"perhaps nowhere were more men willing to venture out in public in drag than in Harlem\\".Dis-membering Stonewall During the first night of the Stonewall riots, LGBTQ African Americans and Latinos likely were the largest percentage of the protestors, because those groups heavily frequented the bar. Homeless black and Latino LGBTQ youth and young adults who slept in nearby Christopher Park were likely among the protestors as well. =Post-Stonewall riot= The Black Gay & Lesbian Leadership Forum at the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation In 1983, after a battle over LGB participation in the 20th anniversary March on Washington, a group of African-American leaders endorsed a national gay rights bill and put Audre Lorde from the National Coalition of Black Gays as speaker on the agenda. In 1984, Rev. Jesse Jackson included LGB people as part of his Rainbow/PUSH.Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, Volume 1 In 1993, Dr. William F. Gibson, national Chairman of the Board of NAACP, endorsed the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation and repealed the ban on LGB service in the military.NAACP‚Äôs Long History on LGBT Equality On May 19, 2012, the NAACP passed a resolution in support of same-sex marriage.NAACP endorses same-sex marriage, says it's a civil right That same month and year, President Obama became the first sitting president to openly support same-sex marriage.https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/09/politics/obama-same- sex-marriage/index.html In 2013, the Black Lives Matter movement was established by three black women, two of whom identify as queer. From its inception, the founders of Black Lives Matter have always put black LGBT voices at the center of the conversation.https://abcnews.go.com/US/start- black-lives-matter-lgbtq-lives/story?id=71320450 In 2019, Atlanta's mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms became the first elected official to establish and host an annual event recognizing and celebrating the black LGBT community.https://thegavoice.com/community/mayor-bottoms-hosts-inaugural- black-gay-pride-reception/ Also in 2019, Spelman College which is part of the Atlanta University Center, became the first historically black college or university to fund a chair in queer studies.

The federal law specifies no discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information. The current federal law does not specify sexual orientation. There is legislation currently being proposed to congress known as the ENDA (Employment Non-Discrimination Act) that would include hindering discrimination based on sexual orientation, too. And most recently, the Equality Act. However, current policies do not protect sexual orientation and affect the employment rates as well as LGBT individual's incomes and overall economic status. The alone Black people in the United States of America as of the 2010 consensus is 14,129,983 people. Out of that, it is estimated that 4.60 percent of the black population identify as LGBT. Within the Black LGBT community many face economic disparities and discrimination. Statistically black LGBT individuals are more likely to be unemployed than their non-black counterparts. According to the Williams Institute, the vast difference lies in the survey responses of ‚Äúnot in workforce‚Äù from different populations geographically. Black LGBT individuals, nonetheless, face the dilemma of marginalization in the job market. As of 2013, same-sex couples' income is lower than those in heterosexual relationships with an average of $25,000 income. For opposite-sex couples, statistics show a $1,700 increase. Analyzing economic disparities on an intersectional level (gender and race), the black man is likely to receive a higher income than a woman. For men, statistics shows approximately a $3,000 increase from the average income for all black LGBT identified individuals, and a $6,000 increase in salary for same-sex male couples. Female same-sex couples receive $3,000 less than the average income for all black LGBT individuals and approximately $6,000 less than their male counterparts. (Look at Charts below) The income disparity amongst black LGBT families affects the lives of their dependents, contributing to poverty rates. Children growing up in low-income households are more likely to remain in the poverty cycle. Due to economic disparities in the black LGBT community, 32% of children raised by gay black men are in poverty. However, only 13% of children raised by heterosexual black parents are in poverty and only 7% for white heterosexual parents.

Comparatively looking at gender, race, and sexual orientation, black women same-sex couples are likely to face more economic disparities than black women in an opposite sex relationship. Black women in same-sex couples earn $42,000 compared to black women in opposite-sex relationships who earn $51,000, a twenty-one percent increase in income. Economically, black women same-sex couples are also less likely to be able to afford housing. Approximately fifty percent of black women same-sex couples can afford to buy housing compared to white women same-sex couples who have a seventy-two percent rate in home ownership.  Black transgender people  Black transgender individuals face higher rates of discrimination than black LGB individuals. While policies have been implemented to inhibit discrimination based on gender identity, transgender individuals of color lack legal support. Transgender individuals are still not supported by legislation and policies like the LGBT community. New reports show vast discrimination in the black transgender community. Reports show in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey that black transgender individuals, along with non- conforming individuals, have high rates of poverty. Statistics shows a 34% rate of households receiving an income less than $10,000 a year. According to the data, that is twice the rate when looking at transgender individuals of all races and four times higher than the general black population. Many face poverty due to discrimination and bias when trying to purchase a home or apartment. 38% of black trans individuals report in the Discrimination Survey being turned down property due to their gender identity. 31% of the black individuals were evicted due to their identity. Black transgender individuals also face disparities in education, employment, and health. In education, black transgender and non-conforming persons face brutish environments while attending school. Reporting rates show 49% of black transgender individuals being harassed from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Physical assault rates are at 27% percent, and sexual assault is at 15%. These drastically high rates have an effect on the mental health of black transgender individuals. As a result of high assault/harassment and discrimination, suicide rates are at the same rate (49%) as harassment to black transgender individuals. Employment discrimination rates are similarly higher. Statistics show a 26% rate of unemployed black transgender and non-conforming persons. Many black trans people have lost their jobs or have been denied jobs due to gender identity: 32% are unemployed, and 48% were denied jobs.  Health disparities  Black LGBT individuals face many health risks due to discriminatory policies and behaviors in medicine. Due to lack of medical coverage and adequate medical treatment, many are faced with heath risks. There is no current legislation fully protecting LGBT individuals from discrimination in the public sphere concerning health care. President Barack Obama has recently written a memo to the Department of Health and Human Services to enact regulations on discrimination of gay and transgender individuals receiving Medicare and Medicaid, as well as to permit full hospital visitation rights to same-sex couples and their families. The United States of Housing and Urban Development proposed policies that would allow access and eligibility to core programs regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is currently working to be inclusive, as courts have recently passed interpretation of the ACA to prohibit discrimination against transgender individuals and gender non-conforming persons. = HIV/AIDS = One of the greatest concerns in the Black LGBT community is sexually transmitted diseases, and one of the greatest STDs affecting the Black community is HIV/AIDS. Black people account for 44% of new HIV infections in both adults and adolescents. Black women account for 29% of new HIV infections. For black LGBT male-identified individuals, 70% of the population accounts for new HIV infections for both adults and adolescents. The rates of HIV for black LGBT men are higher than their non-black counterparts. One of the major factors that contributes to higher rates of STDs like HIV/AIDS is lack of medical access. Rather than a high prevalence of unsafe sex, it is caused by a limited supply of antiretroviral therapy in non-white communities.  Depiction in popular culture  African-American LGBT culture has been depicted in films such as Patrick Ian Polk's Noah's Arc and Punks, Pariah, and Barry Jenkins' Moonlight, which not only has the main character as a gay African-American but is written by an African American and is based on a play by black gay playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney. In 2018, the critically acclaimed TV show Pose premiered, which is the first to feature a predominately people of color LGBT cast on a mainstream channel.  Black gay pride  Several major cities across the nation host black gay pride events focused on uplifting and celebrating the black LGBT community and culture.

It was built in 1902. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Wodonga house was constructed on its original site in 1902. The land on which it was located was first settled in 1849 when a number of runs were taken up by W B Tooth and Company. These holdings eventually developed into a cattle property known as Widgee Station. Government resumptions of Widgee Station began in 1869, and in 1877 James Meakin junior successfully applied for a 640-acre portion, which was to become Wodonga Station. In 1878 an adjoining portion was selected and further land was acquired until 1912 when Wodonga covered 1194 acres, making it one of the largest properties in the district. By January 1882, part of the holding had been transferred to James Meakin senior. The Meakins were cheese makers and also supplied produce to the residents of Gympie. Prior to 1880, the Meakin brothers constructed the first homestead on the site. In 1887, Wodonga was transferred to Catherine Ellen Hillcoat, wife of John William Hillcoat, manager of Hope Crushing Battery at nearby Black Snake Mineral Field. Hillcoat's son Harold and his wife settled on the property and raised their family of five boys and four girls. The Hillcoats continued the practice of cheese making and dairying and the family lived in the original homestead until 1902, when they constructed the current homestead. The first stage comprised four rooms with a shingle roof. Pine floorboards were brought from the Gympie sawmill in exchange for pine logs from Wodonga. Two rooms were later added and the roof was extended and clad in corrugated iron. The new building was located adjacent to the existing on the northern side enabling the kitchen to be re-used and eventually connected to the new building. It contained five bedrooms and a sitting room, with the original homestead building retained for use as a schoolroom and accommodation for visitors and workmen. The buildings were surrounded by a picket fence. Around 1908 the Hillcoats ceased dairying and concentrated on raising beef cattle, supplementing their income by selling possum and kangaroo skins. In 1911-1912 the family worked timber getting in the surrounding area, though the property then reverted to dairying under Percy Pointen who married one of the Hillcoat daughters. When Pointen died the property was sold to the Wodonga Pastoral Company and was used to raise beef cattle again. From 1962 the homestead was unoccupied and became derelict. In August 1978, the homestead building was sold to the Widgee Historical Society and relocated to the Widgee Hall and Recreation Association grounds. Repairs have been carried out and it has been restumped and re-roofed. It is currently used intermittently for community events. The original homestead and kitchen have not survived.  Description  The former Wodonga house is now situated near the clubhouse within the grounds of the Widgee Historical and Recreational Association. It is a rectangular timber structure set on low stumps with a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. The roof over the rear section is angled down from the main roof, suggesting it was a verandah that had been extended and built in. The floor joists, studs and rafters are split and adze dressed. An open verandah runs along the front of the building supported on plain timber posts. The building shows evidence of being constructed in stages, the walls containing examples of split slabs, hand dressed chamferboards, pit-sawn weatherboards and machine-sawn boards. The interior is divided into six main rooms divided by timber walls. It has timber floors and is unceiled.  Heritage listing  Wodonga House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The house, formerly at Wodonga, is typical of many small homestead buildings, being built from local materials and showing evidence of being added to and adapted over the years to accommodate the changing needs of its occupants.

Overview  Established in 1974 by several doctoral students of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, the company was a pioneer in computer graphics with early industry advances in solid modelling design and boundary representation. The company revolutionised the computer aided design (CAD) industry in the 1970s and 1980s, by creating and commercialising the solid modelling software market in 1978. The use of solid modelling techniques allows for the automation of several difficult engineering calculations that are carried out as a part of Shape Data's software programs, including simulation, planning, and verification of design processes of three dimensional objects. Shape Data released a series of products that helped create the foundations of computer aided design programming, namely Romulus, Romulus-D, Parasolid, and the Unigraphics Solids programs. The Parasolid program remains an industry standard for engineering departments and companies, in the design of manufacturing products from small scale tools and equipment to automobiles and aeroplanes. Shape Data was sold several times to large multinational companies in the information technology industry. As of 2016‚Äì03 the company was a subsidiary of Siemens AG. History =University of Cambridge= Shape Data was founded in 1974 by Doctors Charles Lang, Ian Braid, Alan Grayer, and Peter Veenman. Veenman became the sole employee of the company at the time of its founding, while Lang, Braid, and Grayer initially continued work at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. All four founders were doctoral students at the University of Cambridge. In 1965, Professor Maurice Wilkes and his graduate student Lang established the Computer Aided Design Group at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The initial purpose of the research group was to develop tools for building mechanical CAD/CAM systems. In particular, the group worked to engineer early forms of computational geometry, computer graphics, and software system components. Early revenue for Shape Data came from business- to-business consultancies.Roberts, John. (1990) \\"Shape Data Limited: Cambridge University Case Study\\". Judge Institute of Management Studies, Cambridge University, p. 19. In 1975, the company was contracted by the General Electric Company to develop a solid modeller based on the computational geometric work of Ian Braid's Ph.D thesis. In 1978, after three years of development, Shape Data released Romulus, the world's first commercialised solid geometric modeller software program. By 1980, the company had expanded to about a dozen employees. The company was the target of a takeover bid by Weir Group, followed a year later by another takeover bid by Racal-Redac. In 1979, Shape Data reached an agreement with Evans and Sutherland of Salt Lake City, Utah to distribute Romulus in the United States. Evans and Sutherland President Dave Evans became interested in acquiring Shape Data, as the young company was seen as an entry point into advanced computer aided engineering. Concurrently, the company founders saw Evans and Sutherland as more favourable to the strategic development goals of their company and an opportunity to inject needed capital into Shape Data for further research and development of Romulus. = Evans and Sutherland = In 1980, Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation entered into a contract with Shape Data to market the Romulus geometric modelling program. The company was sold to Evans & Sutherland in 1981. After acquisition, Evans & Sutherland injected a large amount of capital into Shape Data, allowing for rapid expansion of staff and procurement of computing equipment. In 1981, Shape Data had 17 employees. In 1983, the company had 40 and by 1986 staff had grown to 70. In May 1984, the managing director position was created and Peter Veenman was appointed. In 1988, Shape Data was close to fragmenting. In January 1988, Siemens bought Shape Data's Parasolid product and development group from the parent company. The administrative staff and the Romulus-D product and development group were left out of the deal. In 1988, Caterpillar committed to the Romulus-D program as the first major customer. Caterpillar discovered shortly thereafter that the rights to Parasolid, the geometric modelling kernel of Romulus-D, were being sold to Siemens. Caterpillar hastily arranged the takeover of financing of Shape Data's to prevent the sale of Parasolid. =McDonnell Douglas= Shape Data was sold to McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Limited on 31 October 1988.\\"Computer Business Review. Shape Data Sold On To McDonnell Douglas.\\" 30 October 1988. Retrieved 2 November 2015. Ron Belcher, a senior software project manager at McDonnell Douglas, was appointed head of Shape Data at the time of the acquisition. Belcher created a paradigm shift in the management of the company. Since the founding of Shape Data, the culture focused on technology-led development and managerial decision making. Under Belcher, the central focus of the company shifted into financial and market oriented strategic management decision making. The company pursued a Blue Ocean Strategy by being the first company to create and enter the three dimensional CAD market. In 1988, Shape Data developed Parasolid, an upgrade of Romulus, that allowed the joining of boundary represented surfaces together as a solid. This program was the most advanced solid modelling kernel available on the market at the time of its 1989 release. =EDS= In 1991, the McDonnell Douglas Systems Integration groups, including Shape Data, were acquired by EDS (then a part of General Motors Corp., now part of HP Enterprise Services). EDS branded the acquired business as EDS Unigraphics. Eventually, in 1997 EDS set up its Unigraphics division as a wholly owned subsidiary called Unigraphics Solutions. =Siemens= Shape Data was sold to Siemens AG on 24 January 2007.Siemens announces Siemens PLM Software strategic business unit The company is presently a subsidiary of Siemens PLM Software, a business unit of Siemens AG.

Founded in 1910, it is a subsidiary of Interserve. History Clough Smith was founded in 1910 by electrical engineers Norman Clough and Sidney Smith, who moved into the manufacture of overhead power supplies for electrical tramways and trolleybuses. It designed and manufactured both overhead and rail supplies for many systems in Britain prior to World War I. Post-war, the company used the profits from completion of work on the Teesside trolley system to purchase trolleybuses which had been in storage during the war. These were immediately sold at a profit and provided a basis for the trolleybus side of the business. The general manager of the Teesside Railless Traction Board developed a new and improved trolleybus design and Clough Smith arranged for it to be manufactured It was marketed as the Straker-Clough trolley omnibus. This chassis and design came to be regarded as both pioneering and improving the industry standard.The First Well Designed Trolleybus Commercial Motor 11 October 1921 The chassis was manufactured by Straker-Squire, the electrical equipment by British Thomson-Houston of Bath, with Clough arranging the production of the bodies. The completed product was sold to system operators as part of a package deal which included the design, supply and installation of the overhead electrical equipment. Between October 1921 and September 1926, Clough Smith sold 63 solid-tyred trolley omnibuses. Most went to various corporations in Yorkshire, but some were exported to Bloemfontein, South Africa and George Town, Penang. In 1925, Straker-Squire was placed in voluntary liquidation and subsequently into receivership. By this time, Karrier had produced the UK's first three- axle passenger vehicle aided by developments in pneumatic tyres and Clough Smith themselves had moved to pneumatic-tyred production in November 1926 with a new LL (for low-loading) model. The company subsequently entered into an arrangement with Karrier to produce the Karrier-Clough trolley omnibus which Clough would market. Karrier allocated the number E6, to this model. The contract with Karrier ended in 1933, but Clough Smith continued as a manufacturer and supplier of associated electrical equipment and was still active in the field in 1968/69, when the company removed redundant equipment from the Reading system. The company subsequently diversified into cable and electrical supply, of all types, both in the UK and abroad, as well as railway signalling systems and the installation of one of the earliest fibre-optic systems for Mercury Communications which was laid alongside British Rail tracks. It specialises in electrical and associated equipment for rail systems.Clough gets signal Construction News 28 October 1999 In April 1990, Clough Smith was purchased by Tilbury.

History  Horse riders by the Woolooga Rail Bridge, circa 1912 The Woolooga Rail Bridge was built in 1884 and crosses Wide Bay Creek on the Maryborough to Kilkivan branch line. The Kilkivan branch was built while the Maryborough Railway was not connected to any other system. A short section to Dickabram on the bank of the Mary River was opened on 1 January 1886. The section to Kilkivan opened on 6 December 1886 after the completion of the major combined Dickabram rail-road bridge over the Mary River. The Kilkivan branch, built in the hope of stimulating gold and copper mining, was ultimately extended to serve the South Burnett. Besides a major bridge over the Mary River, the Kilkivan branch crossed Wide Bay Creek three times. Tenders were called for just , and had to be called twice as the short length made the project unattractive to contractors. The work for the whole section to Kilkivan was let to MCDermott, Owen & Co in August 1884.

It was built in 1887 by Queensland Department of Public Works. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 June 2011.  History  An 1887 brick powder magazine, with post World War II timber extensions, is located on Traveston Road south of the Traveston railway station. The magazine was relocated from Gympie to Traveston in 1898 and became a Soldiers' Memorial Hall in 1923. The former magazine is rare surviving evidence of the infrastructure associated with Gympie's mining heyday, specifically the use of explosives in deep-reef mining. It is also evidence of the Australian practice of commemorating the sacrifices of World War I and World War II with memorial halls and honour boards. The magazine at Traveston was initially located in the town of Gympie, which was established after the discovery of gold by James Nash, announced in October 1867. The new gold field established Queensland as a significant gold producer, contributing much needed finances to the young colony. Although the alluvial deposits were quickly exhausted, from 1868 shallow reef mining occurred. From 1875 a third phase of mining began, based on deep reef mining, which marked a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie. Peak gold production occurred in 1903 but by 1927 production at Gympie had almost ceased. Reef mining led to the need for explosives to break up rock. For over a century control of all explosives and gunpowder imported into Queensland was the province of the Harbour Master's Department (1860‚Äì62), the Department of Ports & Harbours (1862‚Äì93), the Marine Department (1894-1928), and the Department of Harbours and Marine (1929‚Äì63). In 1964, responsibility was shifted to the Queensland Department of Health. Under The Navigation Act 1876 the master of any ship entering a Queensland port with gunpowder to be unloaded had to ensure that it was placed in a government magazine. The various harbour departments therefore were responsible for the provision of magazines and for the safe storage of explosives at Queensland ports of entry. The Act further regulated the conveyance and storage of gunpowder in any place in Queensland, not just in the ports. On the goldfields, magazines were initially administered by the Mines Department, as control of magazines outside ports was not vested in the Marine Department until 1907. Some common magazine design features include sturdy construction, small windows and solid doors, ventilation and overhanging eaves, timber floors with copper nails or timber pegs instead of iron nails, and the provision of lightning conductors and copper earthing straps. Magazines were generally located away from population centres and were sometimes surrounded by earthworks to deflect any blast. In addition, magazine complexes were often surrounded by walls or fences to keep people out. Traveston once possessed all of the above properties except the earthworks. The Queensland Department of Public Works built powder magazines during the 1860s at Brisbane, Maryborough and Gympie; and during the 1870s at Townsville, Ravenswood, Mount Perry (Mount Perry Powder Magazine), Millchester, Cooktown (Cooktown Powder Magazine), Eagle Farm, Thornborough and Maytown. The first government magazines at Cairns (on a floating barge), Charters Towers, Croydon, Georgetown, Herberton, Normanton, Port Douglas and Rockhampton were all built in the 1880s. Magazines were also upgraded and replaced when necessary, and several were built at Gympie, in two different locations. Gympie's first magazine was built in 1868 by the Department of Public Works, at a cost of ¬£191, on the west side of Commissioner's Gully (just west of today's Queens Park). The Gympie Times of 27 October 1868 suggested that people use it, \\"as there is as much powder stored in Mary Street as would blow Gympie out of existence. Rather a pleasant fact to dream about\\". However, the brick building proved inadequate by 1878. There was insufficient space and a timber skillion section had been added to store excess explosives. A powder explosion in a Mary Street store in 1877 made townsfolk nervous, and tenders for a new magazine were called in May 1878. A new magazine site was chosen on Rifle Range Road, and the new powder magazine was finished, except for painting, by late November 1878. About ¬£496 was spent on construction, and an August 1878 plan shows a timber building set on stumps, with internal dimensions of , sited within a cutting into a hillside and surrounded by a fence. JG Glover was appointed as magazine keeper in 1880, and in early 1885 James Nash, who had lost most of his money in poor business dealings, was appointed as the magazine keeper at a salary of ¬£100 per annum. His daughter, Miss Amy Nash, eventually became the effective keeper of the magazine on behalf of her father. Architectural drawing of the Dynamite Magazine, Gympie, 1885 A dynamite magazine of a similar design to the powder magazine was added to the site at a cost of ¬£217 over 1885-86. An additional powder magazine was built at a cost of ¬£402 over 1887-88, tenders being invited in September 1887. This third magazine was made of brick, with internal dimensions of with thick walls. There were three narrow windows on each side, with a door at one end, and the roof ridge was capped with a round ventilator, on which sat a lightning conductor which was earthed by copper straps which dropped from the hipped roof to the ground and trailed away from the building. Despite these precautions, the magazine's location was still not distant enough from the town for some people, and agitation to move it accelerated after a loud explosion in November 1897, when some old explosives from the magazine were destroyed in an amateurish manner by an explosives company representative, some from the magazine. The locality of Traveston, south of Gympie and on the North Coast railway line, was selected as the site of a new magazine, against the wishes of its residents and the Mines Department. In June 1898 the Mayor of Gympie urged the Queensland Premier to speed up the process of moving the magazines, and tenders to remove the magazine complex and keeper's cottage from Gympie and re-erect them at Traveston were called in July 1898. JC Thompson's tender for ¬£659 was accepted in August, and the move was completed by the end of January 1899. When the magazine buildings were moved to Traveston, James Nash and his daughter went with them. When Nash retired in 1912 he was granted a government pension of ¬£100 per annum, in honour of his services to Queensland, and Amy's husband, Joseph Moore, was appointed keeper of the magazine. James Nash died in October 1913, aged 79. A 29.5 acre (11.94 hectare) Reserve for an Explosives Magazine (Portion 877A), located to the south of the Traveston railway station, was gazetted in April 1900. The magazine keeper's cottage was located at the northern point of the reserve. An undated plan shows the three magazines arranged in a row, facing the railway line, with the brick magazine in the centre between the two timber magazines. However, locals contend that both timber magazines were located to the north of the brick magazine, and this seems to be supported by 1914 correspondence which refers to the centre building being on stumps. After the move from Gympie, new timber loading stages were added outside the door of each magazine, to face a railway siding from the railway station, and an iron sheeted fence was constructed around the site. In 1913 Mr Moore reported to the Portmaster of the Marine Department that the gate to the magazines had been broken by the engine during shunting operations, and in 1915 he reported that the floor of the brick magazine was subsiding. Some flooring and the timber joists under it had to be replaced, due to rot and white ants, and reference is made in 1918 to the use of copper nails in the floor. In 1921 the magazine reserve consisted of about 29 acres (11.74 hectares), and the magazine complex is described in April 1921 as having: > three magazines, two of iron and one of brick, all in a line, with a siding > and loading platform in front. Each of the two iron buildings measures 25'3\\" > by 17'2\\", with 10' walls sheeted outside with iron and pine inside, pine > cove ceiling and hardwood floor. Both floor and ceiling are plentifully > perforated for ventilation purposes...both buildings are very old...the > brick magazine measures 31' by 21', and is a thoroughly sound building...a > 7' G.I. fence surrounds the three magazines. The Moores were evicted from the magazine keeper's cottage at the end of March 1921, and it was transferred to the Railway Department. In August 1921 tenders were invited for the purchase and removal of the magazine buildings and iron fencing and in September the tenders of LJ Macpherson (¬£5 for the brick magazine) and MJ Griffin (¬£94 7s 3d for the fence and the two iron magazines) were accepted. However, other parties were showing an interest in the brick magazine building. World War I (1914-1918), although fought in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, had a profound impact on Australia. Over 300,000 Australians out of a population of 4 million volunteered for service overseas, with approximately 60,000 of these making the supreme sacrifice. Most Australian communities, including that of Traveston, lost young men in this war. Following the war, most communities wished to erect a memorial for those who served, and particularly those who had not returned. The Traveston and District Progress Association was formed in June 1914, but the township of Traveston was not surveyed until after the powder magazine closed in 1921. Dairying boomed in the district between the two World Wars, and there was also a thriving local timber industry, shipping out from the railway station. At a meeting of the Traveston district's residents on 13 May 1922, it was resolved to apply to the Minister of Works for the land on which the (brick) magazine building stood in order to transform the building into a Soldiers' Memorial Hall, for the use of the citizens of the growing locality. A petition was lodged that month by Harry Walker, MLA, and the 33 signatories included E Toomey (Hon Secretary), MJ Griffin and William McVicar. In July 1922 the Department of Public Lands, which was responsible for leasing the magazine reserve for farming, agreed to survey one acre (0.405 of a hectare) for a Soldiers' Memorial Hall. Residential lots were also surveyed on part of the old magazine reserve at the same time. At a public meeting at Traveston on 9 September 1922 John Dickson Kenman, Jens Kristian Hansen, Michael John Griffin, Walter Charles Francis, and William McVicar were nominated as trustees for the Soldiers' Memorial Hall Reserve. The residents of Traveston purchased the brick magazine from Walker by December 1922, as the latter had taken over the magazine from LJ Macpherson prior to July 1922. Local knowledge states that the magazine was purchased by five local farmers who each paid ¬£5 and these were probably the five trustees. On 1 February 1923 an Order in Council granted a 1-acre Reserve for a Soldiers' Memorial Hall (R.767) to the trustees. The brick magazine was used as a hall by the local community between the wars, and a photograph, possibly from this period or post World War II, shows a timber skillion extension to the east side of the magazine building. At this time the ridge ventilator, lightning rods and copper earthing straps were still in place. The lightning rod assembly reportedly survived on a local farm for some time, and consisted of a copper cylinder about in diameter, which had holes for three copper spikes ( thick by long to jut out at angles, so that the tips were apart. Two copper straps at least thick led down the sides of the building to be earthed. In the photograph double timber doors are shown in the west end of the magazine, and these may have existed before the building became a hall. These doors are not on the 1887 plans for the magazine. Lead sheeting from under the roofing iron (of either the two timber and iron magazines or the brick magazine) were recycled by locals for stump caps and guttering. After World War II the former magazine was extended, possibly in 1948, the year of the dedication of the World War II Honour Board. The extension involved knocking down the east wall of the magazine, and adding a timber section on stumps, with the front door being reused in the north elevation of the extension. A narrow timber dining room was also added along the north elevation of the brick magazine, so that from the road the original brick structure is not visible. However the 1887 brick magazine building is still intact, complete with its original six narrow windows and their timber shutters. A timber coved ceiling, probably original, still exists in the old magazine section, along with a decorative ventilation grille, although a new ceiling extends partway into the old magazine section from the 1940s timber extension. During the 1950s the old floor and its square copper nails was replaced. Trusteeship of R.767 was transferred to the Widgee Shire Council in July 1989, as all of the original trustees were long deceased. In 1990 the Traveston Tennis Club sought to use part of the reserve for a tennis court, and to enable this use the reserve was redesignated in 1992 as a Reserve for Recreation and Soldiers' Memorial Hall (R.1809).  Description  Traveston Soldiers' Memorial Hall, 2015 (powder magazine is not visible from this angle) A modest rectangular brick building, screened to the north and east by the Traveston Soldiers' Memorial Hall extension, the former Traveston Powder Magazine stands on a sloping, grassed reserve on Traveston Road south of the Traveston railway siding. The powder magazine stands on concrete foundations and is sheltered by a hipped roof clad with early short sheets of corrugated iron sheets. The roof of the building's eastern end, including the memorial hall extension, is largely clad in recent metal sheeting. Constructed of cavity brick walls thick, the former magazine measures internally with a floor to ceiling height of . The three narrow rectangular openings to each long side each measure and house solid timber plank and rail windows. The building has a polished timber floor and a coved ceiling lined with painted, beaded tongue and groove timber boards and accommodates a decorative ceiling rose. An opening in the west wall accommodates an escape door. The exterior south and west walls have a cement slurry finish; the north exterior and the interior walls are painted. Interior view, showing honour rolls, 2009 The stage end of the hall extends from the line of the demolished exterior east wall of the powder magazine. The original door housed to the centre of this wall now hangs to the opening in the north wall at the stage end. The kitchen wing extension runs along the north side. The hall extensions are timber framed, clad with narrow chamferboards and fibre cement sheeting and are lined with fibre cement sheeting. This part of the building has a flat ceiling lined with similar sheeting, which extends over part of the magazine. Three honour boards commemorating soldiers from the Traveston district who fought in World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War hang on the wall at the stage end of the hall. Soldiers' portraits and commemorative inscriptions and plaques also line the walls around the stage. A water tank, toilets and a covered, open carport space stand to the east beyond the stage end of the hall, and these elements are not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  The former Traveston Powder Magazine (incorporated within the Traveston Soldiers' Memorial Hall) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 10 June 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Traveston Powder Magazine, built in Gympie in 1887 and moved to Traveston in 1898, is important surviving evidence of the deep-reef mining phase of gold mining in Gympie, the site of Queensland's first major productive goldfield. The use of the magazine as a Soldiers' Memorial Hall from 1923 is evidence of the Australian practice of commemorating the sacrifices of World War I and World War II with memorial halls and honour boards. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Traveston Powder Magazine is rare as one of three known surviving 19th century government powder magazines in Queensland. It is also rare surviving mining-related infrastructure from the heyday of deep-reef mining in Gympie. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. As an 1880s brick powder magazine of standard proportions, retaining most of its sturdy perimeter walls and all of its narrow solid timber windows, Traveston Powder Magazine remains a good example of its type. Its location next to a railway line, about south of Gympie, demonstrates the government practice of moving explosives by rail, and keeping explosive hazards at a distance from heavily populated areas.

Specifically, it is how an individual expresses their traits when exposed to situational cues related to those traits. These situational cues may stem from organization, social, and/or task cues. These cues can activate personality traits that are related to job tasks and organizational expectations that the organization values (i.e., job performance). These cues may also elicit trait- related behaviors that are not directly related to job performance. According to the trait-based model of job performance introduced in Tett and Burnett (2003; see Figure 1), trait activation theory suggests three overarching principles (p. 503): * Traits are expressed in work behavior as responses to trait-relevant situational cues; * Sources of trait-relevant cues can be grouped into three broad categories or levels: task, social, and organizational; and * Trait expressive work behavior is distinct from job performance, the latter being defined in the simplest terms as valued work behavior. Tett and Burnett's (2003) Personality Trait-Based Model of Job Performance Trait activation theory suggests that employees will look for and derive intrinsic satisfaction from a work environment that allows for the easy expression of their unique personality traits. However, the theory stipulates that only in situations where these personality traits are valued on the job (i.e., expression of traits is beneficial to quality job tasks), does \\"activating\\" the trait lead to better job performance and the potential for subsequent increased extrinsic rewards (e.g., pay and other benefits). In a nutshell, a workplace environment or job demands that are conducive to the natural and frequent expression of their traits is attractive to people. For example, the trait, extraversion, is associated with sociability and seeking out others' companionship. If this trait is activated by interaction with customers while a salesperson is performing work tasks related to sales, one might expect such trait activation to result in good job performance and potential subsequent financial bonuses. However, if extraversion is activated on the job by the presence of coworkers and one becomes overly sociable with coworkers, job performance may suffer if this sociability distracts from job tasks. In this example, the organizational cues of whether a high sociability environment is expected between coworkers would influence the strength of the cue and the level of activation. Note that it is not an assumption of trait activation theory that trait-irrelevant situations result in poor performance. Rather, the theory suggests that a lack of trait activation weakens the trait- performance relationship. History and development The principles of trait activation can be traced back as early as 1938, when Henry Murray described that situations elicit trait expression from individuals. Tett, Simonet, Walser, and Brown (2013) summarized the key contributions of others' ideas that preceded and influenced trait activation theory. These are twofold. First, it is not a question of trait or situation, but that trait and situation work harmoniously together. Trait activation theory relies heavily on both situational and trait based perspectives on personality. It holds that existing, latent traits are activated by pertinent situations. So, it accepts that both stable traits and situational variance can affect predictable patterns of behavior. This is an extension of Eysenck's work done 20 years before that sought to reconcile the two warring perspectives of trait theory and situationism. This can be summed up as the interactionist perspective, which seeks to solve the person-situation debate by explaining behavior with consideration to both situation and stable traits. Second, situations act as triggers to certain traits that an individual possesses. A certain trait may not choose to manifest itself until a situation arises that necessitates it. This idea accepts the interactionist perspective, as discussed in the first point, and takes a step further in explaining a way in which traits and situation interact. It is as if traits act passively. They exist as stable qualities, but require the active stimulation of a relevant situation to spurn them into action and influence an individual's behavior. However, three primary researchers, Robert P. Tett, Hal A. Guterman, and Dawn D. Burnett, are associated with introducing the theory through two focal papers. These papers synthesized and expanded the two ideas presented above creating what is known as trait activation theory. Trait activation theory makes an argument for situational specificity; that is, whether a trait leads to better performance depends on the context; or, alternatively, whether the context is relevant for performance depends on the trait. Thus, proponents of the theory argue that trait-relevant situations result in better performance than situations that are trait-irrelevant. For example, in a workplace setting, an employee may be assigned to a role that largely contains situations not calculated to stimulate this employee's particular traits. They may, therefore, be seen as unsuccessful, when there is the possibility that they would do far better in another role that offers trait-relevant situations with greater regularity. =Testing the Theory= Since its introduction, several researchers have sought to test this idea. Tett and Guterman (2000) conducted one of the first large-scale tests via an investigation of the impact of situation trait relevance on the relationship between traits and behaviors. Specifically, they analyzed the relationships between participants' responses to a personality test assessing five personality traits (risk taking, complexity, empathy, sociability, and organization) and responses to a measure about behavioral intentions in multiple scenarios designed to target these same traits. Results of these tests support the notion that traits are expressed to the degree that the situation offers opportunities for their expression. In addition, the study found support for the idea that situations can be assessed for the degree to which they are relevant to certain traits (even those targeting the same trait). Kamdar and Van Dyne (2007) also found support for the theory via a field research study in which they examined 230 employees, their coworkers, and their supervisors and found that high quality social exchange relationships at work weakened the positive relationship between personality (specifically, agreeableness and conscientiousness) and job performance. These results were interpreted to be consistent with trait activation theory because they suggested that high quality social exchange relationships signaled the existence of a norm of reciprocity that subsequently constrained the expression of personality. With respect to agreeableness, for example, the authors hypothesized that, relative to those high in agreeableness, less agreeable employees do not have natural inclinations for tolerance and empathy, and therefore \\"need other incentives to motivate helping such as the sense that relationship partners are trustworthy\\"(p. 1290). Similar conclusions were drawn with respect to employees who scored relatively low on conscientiousness. Most recently, Judge and Zapata (2015) developed and tested an interactionist framework of the personality to job performance relationship, focusing on both general (situation strength;) and specific (trait activation; Tett & Burnett, 2003) situational influences. In doing so, they integrated both perspectives and compared the predictive validity of both perspectives, concluding that trait activation theory may be relatively more important than situation strength theory in explaining when and how personality is more predictive of job performance (p. 1167). However, the authors are careful to note that the variance attributable to situational strength is not inconsequential. These authors also note that the study was limited due to its focus on job and task-based cues (to the explicit neglect of social cues) which could also impact the personality-job performance relationship. Practical implications When organizations understand how different organizational cues lead to expression of traits, this knowledge allows organizations the opportunity to create situations that \\"activate\\" the traits they most value, and to select employees based on those traits. However, to understand fully the traits needed for different occupational roles, including team contexts, management scholars recommend organizations conduct Personality-Oriented Work Analyses to improve selection and promotion processes. Organizations can use trait activation theory to help them ensure a positive applicant experience. A 2015 study found that for applicants who were significantly strong in the desirable traits for the position they were being considered for, perceived personality fit with current employees played a large role in their perception of the organization. Using trait activation theory and the related similarity-attraction theory, organizations can design their recruitment processes in such a way that applicants connect to current employees with whom they are likely to identify. The study suggests that the more applicants can come in contact with successful and happy employees that they personally relate to, the more confident they are likely to be in their happiness in a similar environment. Trait activation theory can also help an organization understand how to optimally motivate workers by offering them rewards suited to their individual traits (e.g., introverts will likely not be motivated by rewards involving public recognition such as \\"employee of the month\\" but extraverts will be). In the workplace discussion, trait activation theory is often discussed only in relation to task motivation and execution. However, this is an example of its uses beyond that focus. One 2017 study discussed how trait activation theory can help guide an organization's assessment of leadership potential among its employees. It suggests situations more likely to activate certain key traits associated with leadership ability. Trait activation theory is used in many areas of psychological study and practice, especially in industrial/organizational psychology. One area that it has strongly affected is assessment centers. With conclusions drawn from trait activation theory, assessment centers can write more reliable assessments and interpret results with greater accuracy to suggest whether a tester is more or less likely to thrive in a certain area. = Role in explaining situational specificity = Although not an explicit test of the theory's principles per se, scholars have frequently drawn from trait activation theory to account for inconsistencies in the relationship between personality and work behavior such as performance. For example, personality traits like agreeableness may be key for performance in jobs that require helping others, but less predictive of performance in jobs that do not require the provision of help to others. Likewise, the theory has been used to explain why relatively extraverted individuals seem to perform better in occupations (i.e., those of managers and sales) that involve high levels of social interaction. Criticism  Despite receiving considerable empirical support, trait activation theory is not without its shortcomings. The theory does not appear to address how trait- relevant behavioral tendencies are converted into work behaviors. Some scholars have attempted to address this gap by suggesting higher-order goals, such as the motivation to experience meaningfulness at work, play a role in how trait relevant tendencies are translated into relevant work outcomes (see). Other relevant concepts Bidirectionality ‚Äì a personality trait can positively predict job performance in one situation and negatively predict job performance in another situation. For example, conscientious individuals tend to be detail-oriented and cautious in their decision making; generally speaking, conscientiousness is associated with positive job performance behaviors. In contrast, research has shown that organizations selecting for job positions that requires an employee be adaptable to change might not benefit from selecting an individual high in conscientiousness. Situational strength is also relevant from the trait activation perspective and refers to cues provided regarding desirability of behavior. So-called \\"strong\\" situations involve unambiguous demands (the classic example is a red traffic light), whereas \\"weak\\" situations are characterized by more ambiguous expectations for behavior. Situation strength is related to trait relevance insofar as trait relevance is essentially a characteristic of a situation that can lead to the expression of one trait rather than another. To expound upon this relationships, Tett and Burnett (2003) use the metaphor of a radio station and its corresponding volume in order to distinguish between trait relevance and situation strength, respectively. Specifically, they suggest that trait relevance is analogous to the radio station (i.e., channel) and situation strength to the volume at which the station is played. In other words, trait relevance determines if a situation offers the opportunity (based on task, social, and/or organizational cues) to express a certain trait, and the strength of the situation determines the likelihood that individuals will express the relevant trait or not. For example, a strong situation might include an interdisciplinary work team where there is a common organizational expectation that all team members will help each other, as each member depends on other team member's expertise and experience. In this situation, the agreeableness trait might be activated by the tasks and the organization cues, but even individuals lower on agreeableness will likely help others. In contrast, a weak situation could involve a new employee joining a workgroup where no expectations regarding how people work together have been set. This employee may realize that he has a unique experience that if shared would help another team member finish his task more quickly. In this situation, the agreeableness trait might be activated by knowledge he can help a coworker with a task, but generally without other cues present, it is more likely that those high in agreeableness will offer to help. Trait theory is a psychological approach that includes studying personality traits as relatively stable individual differences which describe general predispositions or predictable common patterns of thinking and experiencing emotions that influence behavior. In fact, personality traits have been associated with important life outcomes (see Personality and life outcomes). The most well- known description or categorization of personality traits is called the \\"Big Five personality traits\\" which includes five broad personality dimensions: conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, openness, and neuroticism (or, in its inverse form, emotional stability). In personality psychology there has been a long-standing person-situation debate wherein trait theorists suggested behavior could be predicted by analyzing consistent personalities across situations, but \\"situationists\\" disagreed that personalities were as consistent as trait theorists suggested. Situationists argued that the external situation ‚Äì not general traits ‚Äì was what influenced behavior. Today, most personality psychologists adhere to an interactionist perspective, where both person and situation contribute to human behavior; as a result, the primary debate no longer exists. Personality-job fit theory (based on the broader concept of person-environment fit) suggests that certain job environments are more suited to individuals with certain personality characteristics, and that hiring individuals who are the best \\"fit\\" will result in higher employee satisfaction, well-being and better job performance. In other words, personality-job fit theory is based on an interactional model which suggests that both person and situation interact to influence behavior.

As of December 2015, he was studying for a MFA at the University of Mississippi. Early years Harrington was born in Roselle, Illinois, to a German-American mother and African-American father. Career Harrington began working for the TSA in 2007, as a screener at O‚ÄôHare International Airport in Chicago, to help pay his way through school. During this time he became a frequent online contributor of humor and creative nonfiction to the San Francisco-based publishing company McSweeney's, as well as the humor website Cracked.com. In early 2012, while still working for the TSA, he started the blog \\"Taking Sense Away\\" on WordPress, with the aim of \\"tell[ing] the public the truth about what was going on at the agency.\\" Originally, he ran the blog anonymously, and attempted to preserve his anonymity by only using public computers, but later switched to masking his home IP address using Tor. In January 2013, the Los Angeles Times published an article quoting a TSA spokesperson responding to the claims made in one of Harrington's blog posts by saying that the claims made therein, including that TSA employees were laughing at pictures of people going through body scanners, were false. Several days later, the TSA canceled its contract with Rapiscan, the manufacturers of the full-body scanners. In May 2013, he quit working for the TSA. The following January, he wrote a 4-page article for Politico about his experiences working for the TSA, an article which was subsequently covered by other media outlets. In a response to the article, the TSA claimed that in it, Harrington lied and/or described long-abandoned practices.

mathematician. Dmitri was born June 30, 1907, about 200 kilometers southwest of Moscow on his father's estate. His father Konstantin Tikhonovich Faddeev was an engineer while his mother was a doctor and appreciator of music who instilled the love for music in Dmitri. Friends found his piano playing entertaining. In 1928 he graduated from Petrograd State University, as it was then called. His teachers included Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov and Boris Nicolaevich Delone. In 1930 he married Vera Nicolaevna Zamyatina and in 1934 she gave birth to Lyudvig Dmitrievich Faddeev who grew up to be a physicist. The couple also wrote Numerical Methods in Linear Algebra in 1960 with an enlarged edition in 1963. For instance, they developed an idea of Urbain Leverrier to produce an algorithm to find the resolvent matrix (A - sI)^{-1} of a given matrix A. By iteration, the method computed the adjugate matrix and characteristic polynomial for A.Hou, S. H. (1998) \\"Classroom Note: A Simple Proof of the Leverrier--Faddeev Characteristic Polynomial Algorithm\\" SIAM Review 40(3): 706-709, Dmitri was committed to mathematics education and aware of the need for graded sets of mathematical exercises. With Iliya Samuilovich Sominskii he wrote Problems in Higher Algebra. He was one of the founders of the Russian Mathematical Olympiads. He was one of the founders of the a Physics-Mathematics secondary school later named after him. References * D.K. Aleksandrov, M.I. Bashmakov, Z.I. Borevich, V.N. Kublanovskya, M.S. Nikulin, A.I.

Historians have different view points about who were the ancestors of Chichua. Some sources state that the family is descended from the House of Chikovani, some state that the family is descended from a man named Chija and hence the surname Chichua, and more precise and factual sources say that they are descended from House of Kakhaberidze, while sharing the same roots as the House of Chijavadze.  Possessions  The House of Chichua was a prominent noble house in the Mingrelian nobility. Historical sources about the early ancestors of this family first appear in the first half of the 17th century. During the rule of prince Levan II Dadiani (1611-1657) the first member of House of Chichua appeared by the name of Ramaz Chichua and during this time he was the head of his house. Princedom of House of Chichua appears from the beginning of the 17th century. Their princedom, Sachichuo which occupied the present Municipality of Khobi and included towns: Zubi, Japshakari, Zeni, Sajijao, Kheta, etc. Chanistskali (·É≠·Éê·Éú·Éò·É°·É¨·Éß·Éê·Éö·Éò) River Their princedom's borders to the east ended at the town of Zana, to the south - at the town of Khorshi, to the north - at the town of Khibula and the western border was made up by the river of Chanistskali. Other than the above listed towns, the House of Chichua also possessed the towns of Narazeni, Bia, Sakharbedio, Teklati, Kvaloni and Mukhuri. Their residence was located in Zeni, where they had a keep, a church and a hereditary castle. Their hereditary chamber was located in a church in the town of Zeni and in the monastery of Khobi. They also had another hereditary castle located in Zubi. The Aznauri (or lesser nobles) of the House of Chichua were: Gvatua, Jorjikia, Lolua and Khocholava, and their peasants were: Beraia, Gvalia, Gvasalia, Gersamia, Jruburia, Kuchava, Nadaraia, Papaskiri, Sigua, Chanturia, Chilaia, Chikhvaria and others. The House of Chichua had their place in the administrative apparatus. From the late documents, it is revealed that the Castellan and Mouravi of the castles of House of Chichua were the Aznauri Gvatua and masters of the castles were peasants Gvasalia. = Influence = Prince Pepuna Chichua held a massive influence in Mingrelian nobility. Because of this King Alexander V of Imereti (1720-1752) wanted his house, the House of Bagrationi, to intermarry with House of Chichua. Pepuna Chichua had inherited the title of Grand Master of the Court (sakhlt-ukhutsesi), which was the highest ranking title after the Dadiani in Mingrelia since 18th century. Therefore, Pepuna could have made the relationships tense between the King of Imereti and Prince of Mingrelia. Pepuna Chichua was engaged with the daughter of Eristavi (duke) of Ksani, but the King of Imereti canceled their marriage and instead married off her sister to Pepuna Chichua, but the king's original plan - which was to strengthen his authority in Mingrelia - failed, because Otia Dadiani helped Giorgi who was exiled in Mingrelia because of his earlier attempt to take the Throne of Imereti in 1741. Princedom of Chichua expended even more during the rule of Otia Dadiani who granted Papuna Chichua large estates, castles and peasants from the Episcopal (Saepiskoposo) of Caishi. After the death of Pepuna, the head of the house became his son Giorgi, whose wife was the sister of the head (Mtavari) of Abkhazia by the name of Keleshbeia Shervashidze. From the second half of the 18th century grandchildren of Pepuna Chichua are revealed - Khakhu and Kacia. From the beginning of the rule of Pepuna, House of Chichua excelled on the court of Minrgelia. But soon in the fight for supremacy the House of Chikovani got involved. In 1768, Prince of Mingrelia - Katsia II Dadiani returned the estates of Episcopal of Caishi back to the church and in 1777, Kacia II named Giorgi Chikovani the Metropolitan of Caishi. In return for the Episcopal of Caishi, Kacia gave House of Chichua other estates. During the Russian-Turkish war in 1768‚Äì1774, prince Khakhu Chichua helped the Turkish garrison camped in the fortress of Poti by providing firepower and food. Because of this help, Turks expelled General Sukhotina's Russian-Georgian army and defended the fortress. By the command of General Sukhotina, Khakhu Chichua was arrested and exiled from Georgia and was sent to Russia. But on the road, near Mozdok, in 1772 he died. In 1777, Kacia II Dadiani, took away the title of Grand Master of the Court from House of Chichua and gave it to House of Chikovani. In the beginning of the 18th century House of Chichua again gained a dominant influence in Mingrelia. House of Chikovani could not do their duties as Grand Masters of the Court and had to abdicate and in 1810 the Grand Master of the Court became Giorgi Chichua, being the head of his house and son of Khakhu Chichua. Relative of Giorgi Chichua, Prince Levan Chichua appears in the highest nobility of Grigoria Dadiani's (1788-1804) widow Nino, who was the daughter of King Giorgi XII of Kartli-Kakheti (1798-1800). Nino at that time, in 1811 visited Petersburg. Other relative of Giorgi Chichua, Khakhu Chichua, after the death of Giorgi, took the hereditary title of Grand Master of the Court, became the head of Chichua and at the same time held the title of the Commander (·Éõ·Éó·Éê·Éï·Éê·É†·É°·Éê·É†·Éì·Éê·Éö·Éò) of the Mingrelian army, reaching the peak of power for House of Chichua. After accumulating both of these titles, Khakhu Chichua became the most influential noble in the court of Mingrelia. He preserved his both positions until his death in 1825. After him his titles were inherited by Prince Levan Chichua.  Decline  In 1838, Prince Levan V Dadiani ultimately took away, from House of Chichua the title of Grand Master of the Court and gave it to House of Chikovani. At this House of Chichua went into rebellion with 3000 armed soldiers, but their objective was not reached. The House of Chichua with all the other nobles in Mingrelia became part of the Russian Nobility with the final incorporation in the Russian Empire of Mingrelia and Kingdom of Imereti.

It is one of the oldest ratings in the United States Navy, having been recognized since the inception of the U.S. Navy. It has had two rating badges during its history. Its original MA rating mark was an inverted star (two points down) until disestablished (1797‚Äì1921). On 20 May 1958 the inverted star reemerged as a nod to the Historical MA Rating whose duty was to provide good order and discipline aboard ships over the enlisted crews. When two senior pay grades were established in 1958, a single (E-8) or double (E-9) inverted star was placed above the anchor for all collar devices and rating badges. The MCPON Rating (1971) specialty mark was established using the former MA inverted star and later expanded to the Command Rates of Fleet / Command Master Chief (1995) or Senior Chief (2015) Ratings. The current MA rating mark following its reestablishment has been a police badge with internal star (1973‚Äìpresent), emblematic of its police or sheriff duties as a modern law enforcement specialist.  History  The master-at-arms rating is not a modern innovation. Naval records show that these \\"sheriffs of the sea\\" were keeping order as early as the reign of Charles I of England. At that time they were charged with keeping the swords, pistols, carbines and muskets in good working order as well as ensuring that the bandoliers were filled with fresh powder before combat. Besides being chiefs of police at sea, the sea corporals, as they were called in the British Navy, they had to be qualified in close order fighting under arms and able to train seamen in hand- to-hand combat. In the days of sail, the master-at-arms were truly \\"masters at arms.\\" = Early years = The navy of the united colonies of the 1775 era offered only a few different jobs above the ordinary seaman level. These included boatswain's mate, quartermaster, gunner's mate, master-at-arms, cook, armorer, sailmaker's mate, cooper, coxswain, carpenter's yeoman, and yeoman of the gun room. These were titles of the jobs that individuals were actually performing and thus became the basis for petty officers and ratings. Also, there were ordinary seaman, loblolly boy, and boy, but these are more related to our apprentices of today. The master-at-arms rating officially started after the American Revolutionary War on board the ships of the United States' early navy. Taking on many customs and traditions of the Royal Navy, the existence of the rating did not take effect until the Naval Act of July 1, 1797, was enacted, which called for every ship to have, among other job positions a master-at-arms.An ACT to provide a Naval Armament of March 27, 1794 Retrieved from the Library of Congress on April 22, 2014. Because of this Congressional act, the master-at-arms rating is recognized as one of the \\"oldest\\" ratings still existing in today's modern U.S. Navy, which includes boatswain's mate, gunner's mate, quartermaster, and yeoman. From 1885 to 1893, a master-at-arms was a petty officer 1st class, who wore a rating badge consisting of three stripes forming an arc over the three chevrons, and a star specialty mark with an eagle perched on the arc. A ship's corporal wore a standard rating badge for a petty officer 2nd class with the star as the specialty mark.https://www.uscg.mil/history/docs/uniforms/1985_USN-Ratings- Insignia_StaceyJA.pdf The master-at-arms rating is formally disestablished in accordance with BNCL 9-21 of March 24, 1921, and made effective July 1, 1921. = 1940s‚Äì1980s = Established in 1942, the specialists (s) shore patrol and security, worked shore patrol teams and ensured basic ship and shore station security. Its name was changed in 1948 to shore patrolman, and it took on some of the official functions of the current master-at-arms rating, only to be disestablished on January 23, 1953 by the Secretary of the Navy as a result of the RSRB recommendations of June 1952. This was officially implemented by BUPERS Notice 1200 of March 5, 1953. Master-at-arms circa 1970sOfficial notification from the Chief of Naval Personnel authorizing the creation of the U.S. Navy master-at-arms rating. According to the Naval History and Heritage Command, the Master-at-arms rating was officially established in 1797, disestablished in 1921,Enlisted rating in the U.S. Navy 1775‚Äì1969 Retrieved from the Naval History and Heritage Command on April 22, 2014 only to be re- established by the Chief of Naval Personnel on August 1, 1973 in BUPERSNOTE 1440 Change 1, thereby making that date \\"August 1st\\" as the official birthday of the modern U.S. Navy Master-at-Arms.BUPERSNOTE 1440 CH-1 Dated August 17, 1973 Retrieved from the Bureau of Naval Personnel webpage on April 22, 2014. This formal creation of the master-at-arms rating was the result of a recommendation made by the Special Subcommittee of Congress on Disciplinary Problems in the US Navy, because of riots that occurred on and in 1972 because of racial tensions. According to the archived reports, the findings of the committee concluded that there was no formal training for the master-at-arms force on the ships, the U.S. Marine Detachment was not effectively utilized by the chief master-at-arms of the ships, and that a separate rating be established to perform law enforcement duties similar to the other military services. After being re-established on August 1, 1973, the rating would only receive sailors who wanted to \\"cross-rate\\" (a rating conversion in the U.S. Navy) and submitted a conversion package to BUPERS after concurrence from NCIS. This conversion package was unique in that it required a letter of endorsement from rated master-at-arms in the community who observed the sailor first-hand in the performance of their assigned NSF duties. Along with the pre-requisites required at the time, these sailors must have been frocked as a second class petty officer or above. The conversion process used the procedures and requirements listed in Military Personnel Manual (MILPERSMAN) 1440-010. In 1982, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, then known as the Naval Investigative Service (NIS), assumed responsibility for managing the Navy's Law Enforcement and Physical Security Program and the Navy's Information and Personnel Security Program. This effectively made NCIS the program manager for the master-at-arms community, responsible for program management, manning, training, and equipping. = Post 9/11 and the expeditionary era (2000‚Äì2011) = The period between the 1980s and the 2000s saw very few changes in the rating after its formation, in terms of tactics, techniques and procedures. Masters-at-arms were performing law enforcement and ATFP duties. Concurrently, for those naval shore installation with a nuclear weapons mission and a collocated nuclear weapons storage areas (primarily naval submarine bases and select naval air stations, the Marine Corps Security Force assigned to that installation's Marine Barracks, held responsibility for access gates/gate guards, perimeter security, and security of stored nuclear weapons. A similar function was held by the Marine Detachment, essentially a reinforced infantry company, aboard major warships that had both nuclear weapons storage facilities and functioned as flagships (e.g., aircraft carriers and battleships). But the majority of Navy MAAs, especially those assigned to ships, still performed archaic duties such as berthing inspections, restricted barracks supervision, linen issue, and seabag locker management. However, the increased terrorist threat changed the way the Navy thought and operated. In the mid and late 1980s, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, in agreement with the Chief of Naval Operations, began removing Marine Corps enlisted personnel from gate guard duties at the naval installations they were assigned to in order to place greater emphasis on the nuclear weapons security role, with Navy enlisted personnel assuming gate guard and perimeter security duties. However, most of the junior enlisted personnel assigned to these functions were not part of the MAA rating and had little formal training in security duties. With the end of the Cold War, Marine Detachments were also removed from aircraft carriers in the early 1990s, the four Iowa-class battleships having been concurrently decommissioned at the same time. However, with the USS Cole bombing in 2000, followed by the events of 9/11, the U.S. Navy began to realize its personnel, equipment and infrastructure were grossly under protected because of a lack of specially- trained personnel, especially the master-at-arms. As terrorism became a real threat, the Navy's leadership was forced to change how the master-at-arms was viewed, used, and task organized, leading to serious changes in force protection tactics, techniques and procedures. This led to the establishment of the Antiterrorism/Force Protection Warfare Development Center (ATFPWDC), the precursor to the current Center for Security Forces and an increase in Master-at-arms manning, which in the year 2000 was barely 1,800 to over 11,000 by the year 2007. In addition, in 2003 the Navy Recruiting Command increased recruiting efforts tremendously help fill the billet requirements being demanded by the various type commanders (TYCOM) to combat the terrorist threats within their area of responsibility. This demand increased sharply when the CNO authorized the formation of the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), which serves as the single functional command for the Navy's expeditionary forces and as central management for the readiness, resources, manning, training and equipping of those forces. The biggest change to the rating came after 9/11 in the form of master-at-arms sailors being assigned to other military units as an Individual Augmentee in support of combat support and non-combat support roles in the various area of operations of the \\"Global War on Terrorism\\". Aside from the authorized billets in unconventional operational units, master-at-arms saw Individual Augmentee duties as early 2003 such as in the Iraq AOR with Combined Joint Task Force 7 (the precursor unit of Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq), headquartered at Camp Victory. In 2006, NECC acquired the program management role from NCIS. The increased need for specialized units such as Maritime Expeditionary Security Force (MESF) and United States Navy Riverine Squadron (RIVRON) units and the manning of several forward deployed locations such as Bahrain saw the need to increase the number of masters-at-arms. It was also during this period, for the first and only time, that master-at-arms were considered a source rating for U.S. Navy SEAL and were allowed to attend Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training. Then again in 2011, this changed with U.S. Fleet Forces Command assuming responsibility as the master-at-arms community sponsor. This shift is indicative of the \\"drawdown\\" the entire U.S. military was seeing from its departure from combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This move marks the change from combat and combat support roles that masters-at-arms participated in the various expeditionary and SOF units, and back to more traditional law enforcement roles with U.S. Fleet Forces Command as the community's functional commander. This move still exasperates the existing issue that has plagued the community from its beginning. The issue of the Naval Security Force not having a single chain of command, or type commander, similar to how the U.S. Army, and U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Corps, or U.S. Air Force Security Forces are task organized. In each of the other services, the entire Military Police Corps are under the direction and control of their respective Military Police Provost Marshal General. = Current (2011‚Äìpresent) = A proposal from within the community has been recommended, suggesting changes to how the master-at- arms rating and Naval Security Force personnel are organized, trained and utilized. Additionally, with the decline in the requirements placed on the rating since the start of the Global War on Terrorism in support of the various operations, this has freed up many personnel and units for a Navy-wide restructuring of the master-at-arms rating. In a 2014 article in Navy Times, the then-Commander of Naval Air Forces, Vice Admiral Dave Buss, stated that all aircraft carriers' Security Force Departments would be manned by rated master-at-arms. This is a tremendous shift in current manning directives since the departure of the U.S. Marine Detachments in the 1990s. Currently, the Security Departments of these ships rely on other departments to fill almost 75 percent of the required security force billets. These sailors, who receive minimal training in force-protection tactics, techniques and procedures, temporarily fill these billets for a duration of six months to a year.  Duties and functions  U.S. Navy Master-at-arms performing a traffic enforcement of the installation's speed limit. = Authority = The authority of a master-at-arms is derived from many sources. Under Title 10 U.S.C., they enforce the provision of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (10 U.S.C. ¬ß 47). Under the Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C.¬ß 13) it provides that local and state criminal codes may be assimilated for enforcement and criminal investigation purposes on military installations. Other sources of authority for masters-at-arms include the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States Navy Regulations, internal directives from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Office of the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV), the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), and local directives issued by the commanding officer. = Creed = I am a Master-at-Arms. I hold allegiance to my country, devotion to duty, and personal integrity above all. I wear my shield of authority with dignity and restraint, and promote by example high standards of conduct, appearance, courtesy and performance. I seek no favor because of my position. I perform my duties in a firm, courteous, and impartial manner. I strive to merit the respect of my shipmates and all with whom I come in contact. = Mission and duties = Naval security force sailors assigned to bike patrol duties. According to the United States Navy Enlisted Occupational Standards, NAVPERS 18068F, it states that Master-at-Arms provide waterborne and land security, aircraft and flight line security, strategic weapons and cargo security, maritime security and platform protection; conduct customs operations, corrections operations, detainee operations, and protective service operations; perform force protection, physical security and law enforcement; organize and train personnel in force protection, physical security, law enforcement, and weapons proficiency; develop plans for physical security and force protection enhancement of Navy bases, installations, property, and personnel; and assist commands in conducting terrorist threat analysis and implementing defensive measures. Master-at-arms perform criminal investigations, with some exceptions. In the Department of the Navy, felony criminal investigations for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps are conducted by federal civilian law enforcement agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which also performs investigations in national security, counter-intelligence, and counter-terrorism. During drug interdiction operations on naval vessels, U.S. Navy personnel are augmented by the U.S. Coast Guard's Law Enforcement Detachment under Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.) ¬ß 379 to perform those law enforcement duties, because of the DOD Regulations and Executive Orders which prevents Navy personnel from being used to enforce state laws. This also limits the ability of enlisted MA personnel from assisting civilian police. The duties of a master-at-arms vary from command to command. Most will primarily perform law enforcement and force protection duties, however, other types of duties are open to the rating depending on the command that they are assigned to. This can be in areas such as expeditionary warfare, special operations support, independent duty, GWOT individual augmentee, protective service detail assigned to a high-ranking official, or corrections. Master-at-arms may also serve outside of the rating, when approved by the community manager, such as in recruiting, recruit training, U.S. Embassy duty, assignment to NCIS or Afloat Training Group (ATG) as a trainer and evaluator, or to a flag or general officer's Staff. As the primary law enforcement organization on a naval installation, master-at-arms may perform their duties operating a patrol vehicle or RHIB; standing watch (or post) at a gate, pier or flight line as a fixed or roving sentry; conducting traffic enforcement; conducting interviews or interrogations; collecting evidence or securing a crime scene. Like any other law enforcement agency, there are also administrative duties performed by master-at-arms such as personnel management, training, inspections, records keeping, etc. Personnel in the master-at-arms rating can also expect to see duties on board a variety of naval warships such as an aircraft carriers' security force department; on a cruiser, destroyer, or aviation squadron as an independent duty master-at-arms; on board a naval shore or aviation installation in the United States or in overseas locations such as Bahrain and Diego Garcia, assigned to the security force or police departments; forward deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan or Africa on a GWOT IA assignment; or assigned to an expeditionary or naval special warfare unit. When assigned to these different types of units, master-at-arms are expected to achieve the same qualifications and watch stations, as the rest of the sailors assigned to that unit. This may include damage control, maintenance and material management, officer of the deck or petty officer of the watch or small boat coxswain. Overall, these specific qualifications are required of all sailors to complete their unit specific warfare qualifications, for example, enlisted surface warfare specialist or enlisted expeditionary warfare specialist.  Uniform  U.S. Navy's current law enforcement metal badge U.S. Navy's current law enforcement patch for the NWU According to early records, the U.S. Navy took its time about identifying ratings by the symbols so familiar on today's naval uniforms. The master-at-arms, or police officer of the ship, wore the white five-pointed star of authority. Prior to the 1980s, they were only distinguished from other sailors wearing the dungaree uniform, by wearing a brassard on their arm with the letters \\"MAA\\". Eventually, commands locally purchased and issued metal badges to masters-at-arms, similar to civilian law enforcement agencies. This, however, caused for badge inconsistencies throughout the Navy in terms of the size, color and description, when compared to the uniformity of the other services' military police force. Between the 1980s and 2010 saw the use of the woodland and desert camouflage utility uniform by master-at-arms throughout the Navy, with metal or cloth badges worn on the left breast pocket of the uniform, centered in the middle of the left pocket for men and 1/4 inch above the U.S. Navy tape (or warfare device) for women. The camouflage utility uniform for the Navy was exactly the same uniform worn by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army known as the battle dress uniform. Today master-at-arms wear the same uniform worn throughout the fleet, the navy working uniform type I, with a \\"universal\\" metal or cloth badge affixed to right side of the uniform, 1/4 inch above the name tape of the sailor, with no difference in position for gender. Masters-at-arms serving in a specific operational units may also be authorized to wear the navy working uniform type II (digital desert pattern) or the navy working uniform type III (digital woodland pattern). In these situations, the TYCOM, combatant commander, or unit commander for those units may issue specific orders to deviate from U.S. Navy Uniform Regulations. = Rating badge = Between 1885 and 1893, the master-at-arms was established as a first-class petty officer and wore a distinctive badge consisting of three stripes forming an arc over the three chevrons and specialty mark with an eagle perched on the arc. This would subsequently be used for the newly created rank of chief petty officer. The ship's corporal was then authorized to wear a standard rating badge for petty officer 2nd class with the star as the specialty mark. The current rating badge, as authorized by BuPers Notice 1440 (May 4, 1973, effective August 1, 1973) and approved by the Secretary of the Navy on March 8, 1974 has been the current rating badge for the master-at-arms.Stacy, J.

In October 2001, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) designated the commander in chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) as concurrent commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command. This action was prompted by the recent terrorists‚Äô attacks against the U.S. and the increased awareness among military official that the Navy‚Äôs force protection posture was in need of revision. Known today as U.S. Fleet Forces Command, its mission is to serve as the executive agent regarding all aspects of force protection for the fleet. In November 2001, U.S. Fleet Forces Command established the Antiterrorism/Force Protection Warfare Development Center (ATFPWDC) in response to the rapid increase of fleet training needs in the realm of force protection. Known today as Center for Security Forces, its mission is to serve as the training authority for all aspects of force protection for the Navy. Today, the Center for Security Forces provides specific training, sustainment and serves as the Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the area of Navy law enforcement, force protection, physical security, small arms weapons training, expeditionary warfare, code of conduct, and the Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP) in those respective areas. Its mission is to develop and deliver force protection and NSF training to achieve war fighting superiority. = Minimum Qualifications = Below are the minimum requirements or standards, that an individual must be able to possess at application or conversion, and be able to maintain throughout their career as an MA.

Upon completion of the applicable \\"C\\" School(s), a Master-at-Arms receives a Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) Code which is entered into their Electronic Training Jacket (ETJ). NECs are sometimes used in the detailing process for an enlisted Sailor when selecting orders to a new command.  Standard issued weapons  Because of the multi-faceted duties of a master-at- arms, it is not uncommon for a master-at-arms to qualify in various small-arms and large caliber weapons throughout their career. Additionally, master-at- arms may be required to train and qualify in various non-lethal weapons. Typically, a rated master-at-arms will at a minimum maintain qualifications in the following weapons to perform their basic law enforcement duties: * Beretta M9 pistol * SIG Sauer P228 M11 pistol * Mossberg 500 shotgun * M16 rifle * M4 carbine * M240 machine gun * M249 light machine gun * Various non-lethal weapons (NLW) and devices  Organizational structure  In a naval unit task organized with a naval security force (NSF) department or detachment, masters- at-arms report to the commanding officer of the command, and are led by a security officer, in maintaining good order and discipline, enforcing rules and regulations, and protecting life and property.MILPERSMAN 1440-010 (para. 9 and 15), Change in Rating Authorization, Retrieved from the Bureau of Naval Personnel webpage on April 22, 2014. Security officers are commissioned naval officers in the limited duty officer or chief warrant officer community with the security occupational designators 649X and 749X. They may also be led by a Department of Defense (DoD) civilian employee who possess the necessary skills, training and/or experience to perform those duties.NTTP 3-07-2.3, Law Enforcement and Physical Security for Naval Installations Security Force enablers may also include personnel in the Emergency Management and Antiterrorism offices who support NSF functions, but report through a different chain of command. Collectively, all personnel responsible for law enforcement and force protection for the U.S. Navy are designated as naval security force. This includes sailors in the master-at-arms rating, commissioned officers in the LDO and CWO field, DoD police officers, contracted guards, and sailors who have completed the required security force training. These \\"non-rated\\" sailors are trained by masters-at-arms with the antiterrorism training supervisor skill set (NEC 9501) or by sailors assigned as instructors to the center for security forces learning sites. Some of the course curriculums required to be completed in order to perform NSF duties include Security Reaction Force ‚Äì Basic (SRF-B) and Security Reaction Force ‚Äì Advance (SRF-A). Non-rated sailors assigned to perform these duties will be designated as auxiliary security force (ASF) for shore installations, or in- port security force (ISF) for naval vessels.

Introduction Technology has advanced to an unbelievable point. Those who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing often experience several limitations in accessing technology in their everyday life. The deaf or hard of hearing community has a difficult time to communicate and perceive information as compared to hearing individuals. Thus, these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information. The use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to their problems by providing higher sound (for those who are hard of hearing), tactile feedback, visual cues and improved technology access. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing utilize a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with improved accessibility to information in numerous environments. Most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and/or vibration. These technologies can be grouped into three general categories: Hearing Technology, alerting devices, and communication support. Hearing Technology Hearing Technology can broadly be defined as any device utilized for improving the level of sound available to a listener. Hearing technology can further be divided into two general subcategories of Assistive Listening Devices or Personal Amplification. =Assistive Listening Devices= Assistive Listening Devices (ALD) can be utilized by individuals or large groups of people and can typically be accessed without the support of specific personnel. These devices typically are used to improve the signal-to- noise ratio (SNR) in any given situation. All ALDs utilize a transmitter that sends a person's voice or other sound source to a receiver that distributes the sound evenly throughout a room such as in theaters and churches or directly to an individual. Sound is transmitted in four primary ways: Frequency Modulation With Frequency Modulation (FM) systems, the sound is transmitted on a specific frequency or channel similar to a radio. The Federal Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has designated specific frequencies for these types of systems. There are now small receivers than can be connected directly to a person's hearing aids through Direct Audio Input (DAI). Any time an FM system is coupled to a hearing aid, special settings and connections are required from an audiologist. Sometimes when several FM based systems are used in the same building, there can be problems with cross over between rooms and channels. Infrared These systems utilize light waves to transmit sound from the transmitter to a special light sensitive receiver. The signal can be broadcast to a whole room through speakers or a person who wears an individual receiver. There must be a clear line of connection between the transmitter and receiver so that the light signal is not interrupted. The benefit of infrared systems is that they only work in the room where the transmitter and receiver are located resulting in significantly fewer issues with cross-over. These systems can be sensitive to external light sources or interfering objects. Induction Loop Induction loop systems utilize electromagnetic energy to transmit the signal. These systems can cover a small area with a loop placed under a rug or may be permanently installed within the walls or ceiling of larger areas like theaters, auditoriums, or churches. =Personal Amplification= Personal amplification is chosen specific to the needs of an individual based on their level of hearing and requires the support of an audiologist to determine candidacy for different devices and appropriately fit and adjust the chosen device. Hearing Aid Hearing aid is an electroacoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. Some technologies also worth noting are Cochlear implants and Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA). While these are not classified as assistive technology by law , they still work similar as hearing aids. Communication Support Technology Following are some technologies employed by deaf and hard of hearing individuals for communication purposes. =Teletypewriters= Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD), previously known as teletype machine (TTY), allows the user to place phone calls using text through a regular phone line. Each TDD has a keyboard with a text screen. A user either needs to connect with another person that has a TDD or use a relay service that can convert the text into voice for the hearing listener receiving the call. With the improvements in technology for phones, pagers, text devices and computer services, the use of the TDD has declined. =Voice Carry Over Telephone= The Voice Carry Over Telephone (VCO) is used by those people who are unable to hear over the telephone but prefer to use their voice to communicate. VCO telephone calls must be made through a relay service. This connection allows the person with the hearing loss to speak to the other party and read their incoming message on the telephone's display screen. There is also a portable VCO device, which can be attached to cell phones, pay phones, or cordless phones. Varying state to state, this service may be free to the consumer‚Äîpaid for but the government. This was a provision of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The relay service companies pick a date that works for the consumer, sets up the telecommunication system, and teaches them how to use it. A third party employee translates the incoming speech in real time for the consumer to read the message. =IP Relay Services= Similar to Voice Carry Over Telephone (VCO), The Internet Protocol (IP) Relay Service is used by Deaf or Hard of Hearing people can use the phone, but sometimes they cannot hear and don't understand voices on the phone. IP relay is accessible through the internet and allows the person to communicate by text. When a user calls someone, there is a third party person, called a communication assistant (CA), who will receive the user's call and the IP relay will go from the caller's computer to the other person's phone. The communication assistant will type to the deaf/hard of hearing person, who will in turn respond, and then the communication assistant will pass along the information to the person on the other end of the line. =Video Relay Services= Video relay service (VRS) or Video remote interpreting (VRI) is a type of video telecommunication service, which use communication devices such as webcams or videophones to provide sign-language and/or spoken language interpretation services. In many cases, getting an interpreter may take some time and they may not be immediately available. The VRI will provide an interpreter on the spot. The VRI has two parties, the deaf/hard of hearing person who is using the VRI, and the interpreter who is on the screen. The interpreter can be on a videophone, web camera, or computer screen. The interpreter will use the audio, while someone speaks and the person will interpret to the deaf person by sign language, and then if the deaf/hard of hearing wants to say something they will sign to the interpreter and the interpreter will use his/her voice to relay that message. =Real-Time Text= Real-time text (RTT) is transmitting text which the reader can automatically read even before the sender finishes the sentence. The Deaf community uses this as one of the ways to communicate. RTT allows the other person (receiver) to read the message immediately, without waiting for the message to be written. The idea is similar to the idea which a hearing person talks on the phone. They will talk continuously without any pauses and interruptions. The Deaf community uses RTT to have a continuous conversation. TDD devices, sometimes called TTY devices, are commonly used for RTT via a regular phone call. Text over IP (ToIP) is a type of RTT that uses IP networks natively. =Real Time Captioning= Real time captioning provides a typewritten account of all verbal information presented within a lecture, meeting, discussion or presentation. All of these systems require the skills of a trained captioner and specialized software or equipment such as a computer. They typically vary based on the amount of information represented within the visual display of information ranging from summaries to word for word transcription. Communication Access Real Time Captioning Also called open captioning, or real-time stenography, or simply real-time captioning, Communication Access Real Time Captioning (CART) is the general name of the system that court reporters, closed captioners and voice writers, and others use to convert speech to text. A trained operator uses keyboard or stenography methods to transcribe spoken speech into written text. Speech to text software is used when voice writers provide CART. C-Print C-Print is a speech-to-text (captioning) technology and service developed at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, a college of Rochester Institute of Technology. The system is successfully being used to provide communication access to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing in many programs around the country. In addition to educational environments, C-Print also can be used in business and community settings, and with individuals with other disabilities, such as those with a visual impairment or a learning disability. Remote Captioning Rather than having a captioner physically present, the user can listen in using a phone, cell phone, or computer microphone which allows the captioner to transmit the text back to the consumer using a modem, internet or some other data connection.

After achieving success in Argentina (as part of a wave of Uruguayan bands to find success there, similar to the Beatles' own \\"invasion\\" of America), the group recorded an album for the New York-based label Audio Fidelity, Break It All. As the label specialized in stereo recordings, Audio Fidelity asked the band (whose name was Anglicized as \\"The Shakers\\") to re-record many of their numbers. In the liner notes of their 2000 compilation album, ¬°Por Favor!, Osvaldo Fattoruso stated that his brother Hugo (the band's normal lead singer) was a bit hoarse, so Osvaldo sang lead on a number of the tracks instead.

History The Pro Footvolley Tour, started 2008, with the first event held on Hollywood Beach, FL. In that event, former FIFA World Cup winner and Brazilian star Romario won the competition playing alongside his partner Joao Luis. The first event was sanctioned under the United States Footvolley Association (the sport's governing body within the United States). The Pro Footvolley Tour's initial event drew close to 5,000 spectators The excitement led to a bigger and broader sponsorship package from both the host City of Hollywood and Bud Light for 2009. The following year, the tournament was held under a larger festival which also had a music concert. This event had international teams from France, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, and the United States, in the end, another Brazilian squad came away champions beating a Portuguese team led by Alan Cavalcanti before crowds of over 7,000 over 3 days. That success, prompted organizers to create Pro Footvolley Tour's 1st World Cup, in 2010. In 2011, Bud Light Lime stepped in as a national sponsor and the 'National Tour' was born. Over the next few years, more fans got to see the Pro Footvolley Tour as it went from simply a South Florida event to one with stops on both Coasts. In 2012, the Tour debuted on GOLTV. In 2013 The tour partner with Regional Sports Networks across the country. The exclusive relationships with RSN's brought the Tour into nearly all major markets in America, often with excellent time slots pre/post MLS Soccer Matches or MLB games, and with an enviable frequency of airings. Competition formula The Pro Footvolley Tour altered some of the sport's traditional rules to make it more appealing to an American audience that covets faster and more aggressive sports. The signature play in footvolley is the over-the-head frontal foot spike often referred to as the 'Shark Attack'. Organizers noticed that this play - similar excitement level of an alley-op in basketball is deeded a bit risky thus the athletes preferred to try it only when matches were sort of decided already or if that was the only option left for an attacking player to attempt. The competition committed thus enacted a new 'super point' making a successful shark attack two points versus just one. At first, players complained; but within a short period of time the sport noticeably became more athletic and more exciting. Teams are permitted three super points per set max; but may execute as many as they want to within a match. Shark attacks completed after the three successful ones count then as only one point. Another aspect of the game that changed was the lowering of the height of the net to 6'8\\" and size of the court to 29'.5\\" x 58'. The rallies shorted a bit; but the action became faster with power becoming increasingly more important on offensive. Tournaments generally begin with 16 or 12 teams with group play followed by straight elimination at the Quarter-finals stage. Appearance United States men's national footvolley team and Brazil men's national footvolley team are the only teams that participated in all editions of the Pro Footvolley Tour. Celebrities Footvolley has become a favorite side sport for some of soccer's biggest celebrities. Pro Footvolley Tour hosted an event for Soccer Without Limits 'SWOL' in which top international stars such as J√©r√¥me Boateng, Oguchi Onyewu, amongst others competed in an attempt to raise awareness against racism in football.

There are mild and severe forms of the disease, which is one of the urea cycle disorders.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of CTLN1 in infants are caused by increasing levels of ammonia in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and include excessive vomiting, anorexia, refusal to eat, irritability, increased intracranial pressure, and worsening lethargy, seizures, hypotonia, respiratory distress, hepatomegaly, and cerebral edema. These symptoms appear within days of birth in the more severe forms of the disease with complete deficiency of the enzyme. As ammonia accumulates further, the affected infant may enter a hyperammonemic coma, which indicates neurological damage and can cause developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, cerebral palsy, hypertonia, spasticity, ankle clonus, seizures, and liver failure. Milder forms of the disease are caused by partial arginosuccinate synthetase deficiency and may manifest in childhood or in adulthood. Symptoms of mild CTLN1 include failure to thrive, avoidance of high-protein foods, ataxia, worsening lethargy, and vomiting. Hyperammonemic coma can still develop in these people. CTLN1 can also develop in the perinatal period.  Genetics  ASS1 is the gene mutated in citrullinemia type I. Mutations in this gene have an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.  Pathogenesis  Arginosuccinate synthetase is an enzyme in the urea cycle, which removes excess ammonia from the body. When it is deficient, either fully or partially, ammonia can build up and cause the signs and symptoms of CTLN1.  Diagnosis  As one of the urea cycle disorders, citrullinemia type I needs to be distinguished from the others: carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency, argininosuccinic acid lyase deficiency, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, arginase deficiency, and N-Acetylglutamate synthase deficiency. Other diseases that may appear similar to CTLN1 include the organic acidemias and citrullinemia type II. To diagnose CTLN1, a blood test for citrulline and ammonia levels can indicate the correct diagnosis; high levels of both are indicative of this disorder. Newborns are routinely screened for CTLN1 at birth. A genetic test is the only definitive way to diagnose it.  Treatment  The main treatments for CTLN1 include a low-protein, high-calorie diet with amino acid supplements, particularly arginine. The Ucyclyd protocol, using buphenyl and ammonul, is used for treatment as well. Hyperammonemia is treated with hemodialysis; intravenous arginine, sodium benzoate, and sodium phenylacetate. In some cases, liver transplantation may be a viable treatment. L-carnitine is used in some treatment protocols.  Epidemiology  1 in 57,000 babies in the US are affected.

It was written by series developers/creators Greg Berlanti, Ali Adler and Andrew Kreisberg, and directed by Glen Winter. The episode centers on Kara's attempt to put a positive image on Supergirl as she attempts to capture a Kryptonian prisoner from Fort Rozz, while Cat pressure James' connection to Superman to get an interview with Supergirl. Plot In the week after becoming Supergirl, Kara is ridiculed by the media after her attempt to stop a fire results in a massive oil spill in the ocean. Among those condemning her is businessman Maxwell Lord, who blames Supergirl for bringing problems to National City. Cat pressures James to use his connection to Superman to get her an interview with Supergirl, to which she eventually agrees. Kara continues her training at the DEO, where Alex defeats her in a room containing Kryptonite. Kara enlists James and Winn to help Supergirl tackle smaller situations, desperate to prove she is capable of handling any threat, like her cousin. It works, though Alex is upset Kara revealed herself to James and Winn, and apologizes for the tough training. In a flashback to Krypton, Kara wishes to more time with her mother, and learns about a Hellgrammite, an insect-like alien able to disguise itself as humanoid and shoot icicle-like venomous darts. In the present, Kara examines a plant attacked by a Hellgrammite ‚Äì escaped from Fort Rozz, who needs DDT to survive. Alex and other agents bait the Hellgrammite by taking DDT from National City's local plant via truck escort, but he knocks out the agents and abducts Alex to an abandoned warehouse. She comes face-to-face with General Astra, who reveals she used the Hellgrammite to lure Kara, intending to kill her and take over Earth. Informed by Hank that Alex is missing, Kara finds her at the warehouse with Astra, shocked to see her alive. Astra reveals her plan to wipe out Earth's population as revenge against Alura, who sentenced her to Fort Rozz for attempting to speak the truth and save their world. Astra asks Kara to join her, but she refuses; they battle while an injured Alex kills the Hellgrammite. Hank arrives with a Kryptonite knife and stabs Astra in the arm. Astra escapes with the blade. Recovering, Alex gives Kara a gift: a room with an artificial intelligence in Alura's likeness, found in Kara‚Äôs crashed pod. Unbeknownst to Kara or Alex, Hank's eyes glow red, hinting that he is not human. Astra has her commander examine the blade and holds off the invasion, realizing Supergirl is stronger than she thought. Cat, after threatening James with termination, gets the scoop she wanted as Supergirl meets her for an exclusive interview, telling Cat that this is \\"her story.\\" Reception =Ratings= The episode placed a 2.2/7 among 18-49s, with more than 8.87 million viewers tuned in to see the episode, a 29 percent drop from the debut episode, and once again tying it with NBC's Blindspot as the top scripted program of the evening. The episode attracted 1,263,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the 2nd most watched programme on Sky One for the week. =Critical response= The episode received positive reviews, mostly for adding more layers to the story's elements. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly notes in his assessment of the review, \\"Stronger Together is strong follow-up to last week‚Äôs fun, albeit super-stuffed, series premiere that includes some great character development for Alex and starts to reveal what kind of a superhero Kara hopes to be.\\"\\"Supergirl: Stronger Together\\" from Entertainment Weekly (November 2, 2015) Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the episode an 8, saying, ‚ÄúStronger Together‚Äù is a great episode that gives us less of the stuff we didn‚Äôt love about the pilot and plenty more of the stuff we did.

The Kyrie‚ÄìGloria Mass for double choir, BWV Anh. 167, is a mass composition in G major by an unknown composer. The work was likely written before the second quarter of the 18th century. In the 1730s Johann Sebastian Bach produced a manuscript copy of the Mass. In the early 19th century, it was published and performed as a composition by Bach. Scholarship published in the second half of the 19th century contested the work's attribution to Bach. In the 20th-century Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV), it was initially listed as a composition spuriously attributed to Bach, and later as a doubtful composition by that composer, with Johann Ludwig Bach and Antonio Lotti mentioned as possible composers of the work. In the 21st century, the Bach Digital website indicates its composer as unknown, noting that the work has been attributed to Christoph Bernhard, Johann Philipp Krieger or David Pohle. History The oldest extant source of the music of the Kyrie‚ÄìGloria Mass for double choir, BWV Anh. 167, BNB I/An/3, is a manuscript score dating from the 1730s, which is partially written by Johann Sebastian Bach.Bach Digital Work =Bach's manuscript= Bach's manuscript copy of the Kyrie‚ÄìGloria Mass originated in the 1730s. (Mus.ms. Bach P 659). The first part of that manuscript was written by one of Bach's scribes, who started the copy around 1732‚Äì35, while Bach himself completed the handwritten score around 1738‚Äì39.D-B Mus.ms. Bach P 659 at Bach Digital website The faded original header of the manuscript carries no (clearly discernible) composer indication. The indication \\"J. S. Bach\\" found in that header is a later addition. Bach's copy is classified as Mus.ms. Bach P 659 at the Berlin State Library, and is considered an original source in Bach scholarship.Mus.ms. Bach P 659 at Berlin State Library website. =Authorship= Up to the middle of the 19th century Bach was seen as the composer of the work. In the second half of that century, Bach's authorship was rejected, or at least questioned, in scholarship, and Antonio Lotti and Johann Ludwig Bach were mentioned as possible composers of the Mass. By the end of the 20th century, the same two composers were still mentioned as the possible authors of the work. In the 21st century, Christoph Bernhard (1628‚Äì1692), Johann Philipp Krieger (1649‚Äì1725) or David Pohle (1624‚Äì1695) were mentioned as more likely composers of the work, indicating that the work was likely composed before the second quarter of the 18th century. Structure and scoring The Mass BWV Anh. 167 consists of two sections: a Kyrie and a Gloria, and is thus a Missa brevis in a format customary in 17th- and 18th-century Protestantism. All movements of the composition are in G major. It is written for double choir, that is, two groups of SATB singers, and each of these groups of singers accompanied by a group of instrumentalists: * Choir I: SATB singers and a string ensemble consisting of two parts for violins, two parts for violas, and one part for violone. * Choir II, consisting of: ** SATB singers, three oboes (in A), a taille (in A) and violone/basso continuo. ** SATB singers and organ. The singers and organ are sometimes seen as a separate choir: some of the older descriptions of the Mass refer to it as a Mass for triple choir (). According to Johann Kirnberger, the voices double melody lines of other singers, and are thus no independent voices: they provide variety and are intended as a reinforcement of the second choir. (D-B Am.B 4a) According to the same author, the B major key signature for the oboe parts implies that the intended instruments for these parts are in fact oboes d'amore. =Kyrie= The Kyrie of the Mass has the usual subdivisions: # Kyrie I: (adagio ‚Äì presto). # Christe: (allabreve). # Kyrie II: . =Gloria= The eldest extant manuscript of the Mass has no written out intonation for the \\"Gloria in excelsis Deo\\" opening words of the Gloria (indicated as \\"Gloria tacet\\" in the manuscript), thus the music starts with \\"Et in terra pax\\". The music of the Gloria section has these subdivisions: # Et in terra pax: . # Gratias agimus tibi: . # Domine Deus: (adagio). Reception Several copies of the Kyrie‚ÄìGloria Mass for double choir, BWV Anh. 167, were manufactured in the second half of the 18th century. (D-B Am.B 4)H.

Am.B 4a at Berlin State Library website. Johann Kirnberger, who had been a student of Bach, saw great qualities in the composition: A further manuscript copy of the Mass was produced around 1800.D-B Mus.ms. Bach P 660 at Bach Digital website. =First half of the 19th century= In his early 19th-century biography of Johann Sebastian Bach, Johann Nikolaus Forkel listed the Mass among Bach's vocal compositions:A few years later, in March 1805, the Mass was performed as Bach's in the in Leipzig. The next month, Johann Friedrich Rochlitz described his impressions of the work performed at the concert in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung:Later that same year the Mass was published by Breitkopf & H√§rtel as . Although this title suggests that Johann Gottfried Schicht, the editor of this publication, closely followed the P 659 manuscript, he amended it in several ways, including: * The figuration of the basso continuo was completed where lacking in the original manuscript. * Parts for bassoon complemented and/or replaced parts written for other instruments in both choirs. * A Gloria intonation, based on the opening measures of the Kyrie, was inserted as a replacement of the \\"Gloria tacet\\" opening of the Gloria section. In 1812, Danish composer Peter Gr√∏nland produced performance material for the Mass, apparently based on the 1805 print. (DK-A R 141).DK-A R 141 at Bach Digital website. Around 1821‚Äì30, Carl Friedrich Zelter produced a copy, with his own modifications, of the Mass: this score, once in the archive of the , went lost in the Second World War.Lost Sing-Akademie at Bach Digital website. Carl L. Hilgenfeld listed the Mass as a composition by Bach in his 1850 biography of the composer. =Second half of the 19th century= In 1858, the Bach Gesellschaft considered whether the work should be included in their edition of the complete works of Johann Sebastian Bach (, BGA). Wilhelm Rust explains, in his preface to Vol. 11.1 of that edition, why he considers the work inauthentic, despite Kirnberger's favourable testimony:In 1865, Karl Hermann Bitter suggested Antonio Lotti as composer of the work. 15 years later Philipp Spitta did the same, although, according to this author, the style of the work is not completely compatible with Lotti's, and he thinks it may, alternatively, have been composed by another Italian, or by a German composer writing in the Italian style. In 1894 Alfred D√∂rffel returned to the issue in a BGA preface, suggesting Johann Ludwig Bach as possible composer of the work. Also the volume with which the BGA closes in 1899 mentions the work in its preface, which was written by Hermann Kretzschmar, reconfirming that the work can not be attributed to Bach. =20th century= Wolfgang Schmieder followed D√∂rffel's and Kretzschmar's judgements about the inauthenticity of the work in his 1950 first edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV), where it is classified as No. 167 in the third Anhang, that is the Annex of spurious works, hence its full BWV number: BWV Anh. III 167\\\\. In his 1990 second edition of the BWV, Schmieder kept the work listed in Anh. III. According to Schmieder the work is attributed to Johann Ludwig Bach or Antonio Lotti. In the 1998 edition of the BWV (known as BWV2a), edited by Alfred D√ºrr and Yoshitake Kobayashi, the positions of several doubtful and spurious works were reshuffled in the sections, following a new methodology explained in the preface of this edition. For this meant that it was repositioned in Anh. II, that is the section of the doubtful works, instead of formerly in Anh. III (spurious works). Like its predecessor, the BGA, also the New Bach Edition (NBE) decided, in the second half of the 20th century, not to include in its publication of all works by Johann Sebastian Bach. In the Critical Commentary of the 9th volume of its second series (Masses, Passions, Oratorios), describes the Mass. =21st century= According to Bach scholar Peter Wollny, the Mass BWV Anh. 167 can be attributed to Christoph Bernhard (1628‚Äì1692), Johann Philipp Krieger (1649‚Äì1725) or David Pohle (1624‚Äì1695). =Recordings= The in G major, , is included, with a recording time of 13:31, in Apocryphal Bach Masses II, cpo 777561-2, by Wolfgang Helbich conducting the Alsfelder Vokalensemble (recorded 2009, released 2012).Apocryphal Bach Masses II at Apocryphal Bach Masses, Vol. 2 at ArkivMusic website.

It is, perhaps, best known as the creator of the \\"Presence\\" app, which allows unused smart phones and tablets to be turned into home monitoring devices and energy efficiency tools. Their products frequently employ \\"Internet of Things\\" (IoT) concepts and methodologies. People Power Company now delivers IoT services for consumer service providers including: * China Mobile, with more than 6 million subscribers * BGE (Baltimore Gas and Electric) * PepCo used in over 600 homes * DelMarva used in over 1,000 homes History The People Power Company was founded by Gene Wang (CEO) and David Moss (CTO) in Palo Alto, California in January 2009 and officially launched in November 2009. Wang and Moss had previously worked at Bitfone, which was acquired by Hewlett- Packard. People Power was initially envisioned as a greentech company with a focus on energy efficiency. In 2013, the company released its \\"Presence\\" app, which is designed to turn older smartphones and tablets into home monitoring devices and sensors using the device's built-in camera. The Presence app also allows users to monitor and control third-party internet-connected appliances and electrical usage in their homes. The app was originally available for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch devices. In mid-2013, the company's Chief Scientist, John Teeter, was selected as a Presidential Innovation Fellow and worked at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). He would go on to work on the Green Button Initiative, which is a program designed to allow home energy customers to access and download their energy usage data. In 2014, People Power began energy efficiency pilot programs in Cape Cod and Oahu. These pilot programs provided a certain number of homes with the Presence app and several free \\"SmartPlugs,\\" which were created by Monster Cable and can be connected to and controlled via Wi-Fi. In Hawaii, the results of the pilot program showed that homes could reduce their energy usage by about 10% per month. In September 2015, People Power received $4.4 million in a series B funding round led by MediaTek, bringing its total funding to $12 million. People Power also has a company band (the People Power Band) that plays a mix of covers and original songs. The band, which features Gene Wang on saxophone and David Moss on trumpet, has played at numerous \\"green\\" events and conferences including Earth Day SF and Earth Day on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.. The band has released two albums: Green Bandwagon and, in 2015, Powered Up. Products People Power's most notable product is Presence, a home security and energy management app that can be utilized on otherwise unused iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, and Android devices through a Wi-Fi connection. The app was envisioned after co-founder Gene Wang's mother's home was burglarized. The goal of an earlier version of the app was to provide users with the ability to monitor and control energy usage. Both the security and the energy management functions are included in the app. The app starts recording video and/or audio when movement is detected, and users can program the app to send a video clip of the movement to their current smartphone. The app has also been used for home monitoring purposes (including as a baby monitor). The Presence app also allows users to control third-party internet- connected products and appliances remotely. Users can create \\"if-this-then- that\\" rules to control energy usage in their homes. For example, they can set specific times for certain smart plugs to stay on or off. They can also manage things like the thermostat and appliances. The app informs the user how much electricity a certain plug is using at any given time. Recognition and awards In 2017, People Power was named in Gartner's annual \\"Cool Vendors in Connected Home, 2017\\" report that identifies technology vendors with innovative products and services that have genuine market impact. In 2015, the Software and Information Industry Association awarded People Power with the Most Innovative and Overall NextGen Award in the \\"Mobile technology\\" category. Also in 2015, the company was awarded the 2015 Energy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Energy Efficient Technology Deployment by the Association of Energy Services Professionals (AESP). In 2012, the company won AT&T;'s \\"Power the Future\\" award at CES 2012. In 2011, Gigaom named People Power one of the \\"10 Greentech Companies to Watch in 2011.\\" In 2010, the company won a GE Ecomagination Challenge Award.

In 1860, in order to develop the Far East, the Russian Government decided to assign the free port status to all the ports of Primoye. In 1900, Sergei Witte, at this time Minister of Finances, canceled the free port regime in Vladivostok, because he thought that it affected the development of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which was designed to unify the Empire.Vladivostok and Odessa just before the First World War, Yukimura Sakon, publication of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

They specialized in a blues-based brand of proto-punk influenced by British groups such as the Yardbirds. The band failed to reach wider audience in the time, but have come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts in the intervening years since their breakup, with their work appearing on several compilations. History The Liberty Bell was founded in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1966, and their original name was the Zulus. They specialized in a hard-driving blues- based style of rock influenced by British acts such as the Yardbirds, as their sound increasingly evolved to embrace elements of psychedelia. The band's lineup initially consisted of Al Hunt on lead guitar, Richard Painter on rhythm guitar, Wayne Harrison on bass, and Carl Abey on drums. The band signed with Carl Becker, owner of the J-Beck and Cee-Bee record labels, to manage them. The band was in need of a lead singer, so Becker enlisted the services of Ronnie Tanner who had sung with another local band the Acoustics. According to Tanner: :Carl Becker introduced himself to me and asked if I would be willing to come and audition for a band he was going to sign to his Cee-Bee record label. They were called ‚ÄòThe Zulu‚Äôs‚Äô. I was asked to meet the band at the drummer Carl Aeby‚Äôs house and the audition went well. I was asked to join the group as lead singer and soon the band‚Äôs name was changed to \\"The Liberty Bell\\". With Tanner now in the fold, they went into the recording studio and in a cluster of several sessions, they recorded all of the output that would be featured on their 1967 Cee-Bee releases. Their debut single, taken from these sessions in McAllen, Texas, was a cover of the Yardbirds' \\"Nazz Are Blue\\" b/w Willie Dixon's \\"Big Boss Man\\" and was released in May. Their next two 1967 releases were \\"That's How it Will Be\\" b/w \\"For What You Lack\\" which appeared in July, followed by \\"Something for Me\\" b/w \\"Al's Blues\\" released in October. The band also cut an acetate of \\"I Can See\\" taken from these same sessions. In early 1968 Ronnie Tanner left the group to fight in Vietnam and was replaced by Chris Gerniottis, formerly in the Zakary Thaks, who brought along several songs with him which displayed lyrics of a more contemplative nature which aptly suited their increasing forays into psychedlia. They signed with Back Beat Records and released \\"Thoughts and Visions\\" b/w \\"Look for Tomorrow\\" in August 1968. They continued their mixture of garage and psychedelic, however they released a soul-style number, \\"Naw Naw Naw\\" in late 1968 on which only Gemiottis participated accompanied by session musicians. The Liberty Bell broke up in 1969 when Gerniottis returned to the Zakary Thaks. In more recent years the Liberty Bell's work has come to the attention of garage rock and psychedelic collectors and enthusiasts. Two of their songs appear on volumes 5 and 7 of Sundazed Records' acclaimed Garage Beat '66 series. In 2014 their complete recordings were re-issued on the Thoughts & Visions 1967-1969 anthology.

He called upon the nearby friendly rulers to send their contingents as this war had need of better organization keeping in view of consequent attacks on the nearby regimes. Forces from Ajmer, Kalingar, Kanauj, and other allies joined the Anandpal's force. Battle The massive army of the allied forces held the Ghaznavids at the bank of Indus River. The invaders faced huge resistance at a place near Hazro called Chachhak or Chachh. The role of a local tribe was very significant in this battle because it managed to annihilate a huge cavalry force of Ghaznavids who were fighting as the vanguard. The tribe was known to be the Gakhar tribe. When the allied forces were moving forward to engage the enemy, the latter threw big fireballs at the elephants which frenzied them and caused them to crush their own troops, turning it into a victory for the invaders. Consequently, the rest of India came under Muslim rule for almost 400 years. Ghazni won the battle and Anandpal had to cede the territory and its treasures. Aftermath The victory paved the way for Ghazni to raid India seventeen times during which he plundered small tribes before moving on to larger regimes and temples for treasures and women. He desecrated all the monuments that unsettled him and attacked holy cities like Thaneshwar, Mathura, etc. On his seventeenth raid on Somnath Temple, he amassed as much loot as he did in his past sixteen raids altogether.

Chadza, as he signed his books, was a well-known Malawian teacher, author and poet, writing especially in the Chichewa language of Malawi. Ezra Chadza was born in the village of Ntande in Dedza District in Malawi in 1923. He attended school in the same village, and then in 1937 went on to the Mlanda mission school (situated at Lizulu between Dedza and Ntcheu). In 1939 he began to teach. He studied for a teaching certificate at Nkhoma from 1943‚Äì45, obtaining the 'Grade 2' or the 'English grade' as it was known at that time. Afterwards he taught at Mlanda before becoming headmaster of Livukezi School in Ntcheu in 1948. From 1949 to 1954 he taught in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). He studied teaching again at Domasi Teacher Training College until 1959. After that he taught at the Kongwe Presbyterian mission school in Dowa District. It was here that he wrote Ntchito za Pakamwa and Zokoma ziri m'Tsogolo. In 1968 he continued his studies at the University of Cape Town. In 1970 with others he started a school to teach Chichewa to missionaries in Kongwe. He also ran the Nkhoma Synod school and in 1972 became secretary of the Chichewa Board, a board set up by President Hastings Kamuzu Banda to encourage and develop the Chichewa language. Ezra Jofiya Chadza died in 1985.Kokha Mcheperawakalulu, publisher's note.In the introduction to their 1980 coursebook for Peace Corps volunteers Learning Chichewa, Carol Scotton and Gregory Orr write: \\"For discussions on grammatical points, we especially want to thank Mr E.J. Chadza, Secretary of the Chiche≈µa Board of Mala≈µi, a gentleman, a scholar, and a source of inspiration\\". In the preface to his best-known book, Kokha Mcheperawakalulu, E.J. Chadza explains that he originally submitted the book, together with four others, to the Publications and Literature Bureau for approval in 1966. Unfortunately the manuscript of all the books was lost when the Bureau was closed. He therefore had to write the book again. The only book which survived was Tiphunzire Chichewa, which he happened to have with him for revision. In the same introduction, Chadza complains about the fact that very few books have been written in Chichewa, and expresses his belief that Malawians should write books in their own language just as other nations do. E.J. Chadza's best known poemKishindo, Pascal J. \\"Recurrent Themes in Chichewa Verse in Malawian Newspapers\\" Nordic Journal of African Studies 12(3): 327‚Äì353 (2003), p.348. is Likongolerenji Bokosi?

In 1867, John Minto purchased and cleared land on an island near the east bank, turning it into productive farmland. That island would later come to be named Minto Island.

It was released on 29 October 2015, three months after the release of the company's second flagship, the OnePlus 2 on 27 July. The OnePlus X was available in three design options: Onyx (black), Champagne (white), and a limited edition Ceramic version. OnePlus has stated that the Ceramic OnePlus X will only be released in Europe with a limited run of only 10,000 units. The OnePlus X originally required an invitation to be purchased, but as of 28 January 2016, invitations are no longer necessary to purchase the device. A China-only variant of the OnePlus X, the Oppo A30, was released in February 2016, four months after the OnePlus X's release. Development and launch Shortly after the launch of the OnePlus 2, OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei hinted at the launch of a new device at the end of 2015 when interviewed at one of the popup events in New York City. After months of speculation by the media, the OnePlus X was officially unveiled on 29 October 2015. It was subsequently praised by reviewers and critics alike for its elegant looking design and high quality build. The price of the phone was announced at $249 for the unlocked version, making it a relatively affordable phone. The Ceramic version of the phone comes in at $399 and features a ceramic back baked over a 25-day manufacturing process, which OnePlus claims was the first of its kind for a smartphone material. Four days after the release of the phone, the company also released an extended warranty programme called On-Guard for users in Europe and India. It gives new OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X users coverage from device breakage, liquid damage, accidental damage, and vandalism among others. The On-Guard extended warranty can be purchased along with the device for an additional fee that entitles the user of the handset to free service and repairs for a period of either 12 or 24 months, depending on the warranty plan purchased. Release and distribution =Invitation system= As with all other OnePlus phones released thus far, the OnePlus X required an invitation to be purchased. Despite heavy criticism over the invitation system, OnePlus has claimed that it was necessary practice for the startup to manage product flow and prevent overstocks from occurring, hence the implementation of the system on all its phones. =Open sales= OnePlus has announced open sales for the OnePlus X after the initial month of sales that was strictly invitation based. Open sales will allow buyers to purchase the phone without an invitation, and will be held every week on specific dates of December that are yet to be announced by OnePlus. Open sales are also held in OnePlus' pop-up events in various cities held by company employees. The company was also keeping Open Sales events every Tuesday in India, while keeping invitation-system intact for rest of week days. Starting from 28 January 2016 it was completely invitation free. Specifications =Design and hardware= The design of the OnePlus X features a smooth glass back with textured aluminium bezels which provides a good grip on the frame of the phone. Both versions of the phone feature a dark glass back reminiscent of the glass back on the iPhone 4. The phone inherits the alert slider first found on the OnePlus 2 which toggles between All, Priority Only and No notifications. Due to the smaller form factor of the phone the internal battery was smaller compared to the OnePlus 2, coming in at 2,525 mAh compared to the latter's 3,300 mAh battery. The lower price of the phone also meant that the fingerprint sensor previously present on the OnePlus 2 has been omitted along with other features like optical image stabilization and swappable back covers. Oddly, the USB-C connector of the OnePlus 2 has not been carried over to the OnePlus X and the phone uses the micro USB instead of the newer USB-C connector. OnePlus has released textured back covers for the OnePlus X which resemble the styles of the swappable StyleSwap Covers for the OnePlus 2 with Bamboo, Rosewood, Black Apricot and Kevlar backs. With a 5\\" AMOLED 1920 √ó 1080 Full HD resolution screen protected by Corning Gorilla Glass, the OnePlus X was a departure from both the OnePlus One and OnePlus 2 which featured a larger 5.5\\" LCD panel with the same resolution. Despite the smaller form factor, users still have the option of choosing between hardware capacitive buttons or on-screen customisable navigation \\"soft keys\\". The OnePlus X was available in Onyx and Ceramic versions with each sporting different unique backs and a slightly different colour. Manufacturing the ceramic version requires a process which was 25 days long and the company has stated that it will have a limited run of only 10,000 units. The ceramic version was slightly heavier at 160 g (5.6 oz) and it will only be sold in Europe and India as announced by OnePlus. Despite being a design-centric device as advertised by OnePlus, the phone packs quite a punch with relatively powerful internal specs which was similar to last generation flagships like the OnePlus One and LG G3. The OnePlus X features 16 GB of internal storage with 3 GB LPDDR3 RAM and the handset was powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 32-bit quad-core chip clocked at 2.3 GHz with an Adreno 330 graphics processor. Other features include FM radio and a dual SIM (nano SIM) card layout with 4G LTE compatibility which can be swapped to include a micro SD storage card in the 2nd SIM slot for the adding of removable storage. As with the OnePlus 2, NFC was not available on the OnePlus X. The OnePlus X has been tested on the AnTuTu Benchmark test and it yields a score of 45000+ points, on par with similar devices powered by the Snapdragon 801 quad core processor. Unlike the earlier OnePlus 2, since OnePlus X does not support any 700 MHz LTE frequency bands (namely, LTE Band 12 and 17, used by T-Mobile US and AT&T; LTE networks, respectively), rural and indoor reception may be poor in the United States, especially in the case of T-Mobile US network, where LTE Band 12 was the only sub-1 GHz coverage option. OnePlus X was also released in White (Champagne Edition) for other countries like India, after keeping it exclusive for home country China. Other than color difference, there isn't any difference in the device. =Software= The OnePlus X comes preloaded with Oxygen OS version 2.1.2, OnePlus's build of Android 5.1.1 \\"Lollipop\\". On 4 August 2016, OnePlus began rolling out version 2.2.2 of Oxygen OS for OnePlus X. The update brings some bug fixes along with changes to camera UI and inclusion of Android's July security patch. On 28 September 2016, OnePlus started rolling out version 2.2.3 of Oxygen OS for OnePlus X. The update comes with Android's September security patch and necessary dependencies for Android Marshmallow upgrade. On 1 October 2016, OnePlus started rolling out version 3.1.3 of Oxygen OS for OnePlus X. The update comes with Android Marshmallow upgrade.

Controlling several Toronto-based hospitality properties and venues, he's been dubbed the \\"King of Clubs\\" due to his influence on the city's nightlife. In addition to Toronto, he also has venues in Niagara Falls, Montreal, and Miami Beach. Khabouth manages his properties through INK Entertainment, a company he founded while opening nightclubs in the mid-1980s, his first ventures in the hospitality business. He initially made his name via Stilife, a ritzy nightclub for the posh crowd at the corner of Richmond Street West and Duncan Street in Toronto that ran from 1987 until 1995 triggering what eventually developed into the city's Entertainment District. Still, Khabouth is best known and widely lauded for his association with The Guvernment, a large 60,000-square foot nightclub complex he launched in 1996 and molded into a famous spot that successfully channeled the energy of the local rave scene during mid to late 1990s and later continued as the focal point of Toronto's electronic dance music scene. Parallel to nightlife, almost immediately after establishing himself with clubs in the late 1980s, Khabouth also began launching upscale restaurants in Toronto, most of them as business partnerships either with local celebrity chefs or various Toronto restorateurs. By early 2010s, Khabouth decided to enter the hotel aspect of the hospitality industry by announcing construction of Bisha Hotel & Residence, an upcoming 100-room boutique hotel on Blue Jays Way in downtown Toronto's Entertainment District set to open in spring 2016. In addition to the hotel part, Bisha is to contain around 300 condominium units thus taking advantage of the 2000s and 2010s condo boom in Toronto. Since 2013, Khabouth has continually placed on Toronto Life's '50 Most Influential People in Toronto' annual list. Early life Khabouth was born in Beirut during early 1960s to father Antoine Khabouth who worked in hospitality and mother Margaret who took care of the household that in addition to young Charles consisted of his older brother and sister. Raised in privileged circumstances with staff in the house, each of the three siblings attended French Catholic private school. By 1970, after spending years managing a restaurant, his father raised enough funds to open his own supper club called Les Trois Tonneaux that went bankrupt after only six months. On his first night back working at the old restaurant, he suffered a heart attack at age 42 and died. Young Khabouth was only 9 years old at the time. His mother soon remarried, to William Nader, a successful Beirut accountant and close family friend. In 1975, the outbreak of Lebanese Civil War made living conditions in Beirut unbearable as the family began sleeping in the parking garage beneath their building to stay safe during nightly bombings. Fifteen years of age by this point, young Khabouth began to be courted by the Christian militia. In August 1976, over a year into the conflict, teenage Khabouth got taken out of Lebanon by his stepfather and mother who altogether fled the country by paying to be smuggled to Cyprus in order to escape the war zone. The 14-hour boat ride took place on a fishing vessel carrying 300 people. Four days after reaching Cyprus, the family flew to Athens and then to Toronto where other family members had already settled. Arriving to Canada, Khabouth enrolled at Overlea Secondary School in East York within Metropolitan Toronto. His penchant for working grueling hours soon emerged as he held three part-time jobs at one point during high school with his first job at a McDonald's while the other two were cleaning carpets and stocking shelves at an IGA store. After graduating, Khabouth took a job at a computer company, but he wanted work that involved dealing with people. Simultaneously, following a few nights out in Toronto, he began growing enamoured with the nightclub scene, quickly resolving to start putting money aside for a possible future attempt at running a nightclub. For the time being, he decided to give retail a try, finding a job at a Stitches store in Yorkville and quickly working his way up to manager there. Not even 20 years of age and looking to start his own business, he launched a clothing line, an entrepreneurial effort in Toronto that mostly consisted of getting the hip clothing stores that catered to the emerging Queen West scene interested in his products. However, realizing it would take years to build a name in fashion, he zeroed in on the nightclub business as his next area of interest. Career in hospitality =Nightclubs= In 1984, twenty-two-year-old Khabouth bought a defunct gay club The Manatee at 11A St. Joseph Street in the Yonge & Wellesley area and after renovations opened Club Z. The entire project was financed with approximately C$30,000 that Khabouth secured by combining a few thousands of personal savings, a bank loan against his Audi car, and money borrowed from his stepfather. After buying the club for C$15,000, he earmarked the rest for the decor. Decorating the basement space modestly with, among other things, merchandise from Canadian Tire, he painted the floors himself and rented a sound system from Long & McQuade while in an effort to make the walls shiny he covered them with the metal sheeting used to make heating ducts. He looked to build regular crowds by catering to various social strata and musical tastes ‚Äî the club's specialty nights included house music Saturdays (one of the first nightclubs in the city to play that type of music) and gay nights on Sundays for the population of the nearby Gay Village. Khabouth worked hard trying to ensure Club Z becomes a success, driving down to Detroit with his DJs during workweek in order to get the latest tunes for the weekend due to nonavailability of house music in Canadian record stores. Still, the first six months were a tough go and it wasn't long before Khabouth fell five months behind on his rent payments. Fortunately for Khabouth, liking the young man's drive, the landlord showed extreme patience. Desperately trying to generate some buzz for Club Z, Khabouth even turned to displaying snakes and cougars during club nights courtesy of a local service renting exotic animals for film work and photo shoots. Still, the club didn't really take off until an infamous Halloween weekend incident when a tiger that had been brought and displayed in the enclosure of the front window thinking it would attract clientele, broke a window after the club had closed for the night, prompting the arrival of police with rifles, the Toronto Humane Society, and local media. The coverage received in the printed press (the incident made the Toronto Star front page) and on television brought increased popularity to Club Z, eventually ensuring profitability for the venue that had been on the verge of financial collapse several times up to that point. By 1986, with a more-or-less steady income from Club Z that for the most part attracted a younger and suburban crowd, Khabouth wanted to expand his patron base by tapping into the more mature and moneyed urban set. To that end he launched Stilife in October 1987 at the corner of Richmond West & Duncan in the almost deserted former Garment District of Toronto. With its aura of exclusivity, sexy vibe, including design and decor by the now globally renowned designers,Yabu Pushelberg, the club managed to strike the right note with the Bay Street and Rosedale crowd, becoming a big moneymaker for Khabouth. The club's success precipitated the arrival of many new clubs to the area whose real estate mostly lay empty since the early 1970s collapse of the city's garment industries. Additional clubs began arriving in the early 1990s, a trend that continued at such a rate that by mid-1990s the area, now officially renamed the Entertainment District also known as the Club District, had the highest concentration of nightclubs anywhere in North America. By the time he decided to sell Stilife due to space constraints, 34-year-old Khabouth had already become well established as the Toronto 'King of Clubs'. His next move was taking over the huge RPM venue by Lake Ontario outside of the downtown core that also included the adjoining club called the Warehouse. Khabouth's original plan was to continue where he left off with Stilife, that is going after the posh, upscale crowd, but now on a significantly larger scale. He invested major funds into full renovation of the venues, complete with installing a new powerful sound system and a new name. The Guvernment opened in September 1996, however, due to the rave culture explosion in Toronto and the venue's huge space, rather than attracting the high-end crowd, it took off as a favourite spot of the rave kids. In addition to fostering local DJ talent such as deadmau5, Chris Sheppard (DJ), Mark Oliver, and Manzone & Strong as well as hosting big international electronic acts like Armin van Buuren, David Guetta, Sasha, Paul Oakenfold, Ti√´sto, Paul van Dyk, and Carl Cox, Khabouth's Guvernment, in its adjoining venue Kool Haus that could hold up to 2,500 people, also regularly hosted live band performances, starting with Marilyn Manson in October 1996 and followed by David Bowie's and INXS' respective back-to-back gigs during the same week in late September 1997 while the venue was still called the Warehouse. The fall 1997 name change to Kool Haus didn't disrupt the already established live concert practice so that touring acts continued playing the venue, including Bad Religion in March 2002, Garbage in April 2002 and April 2005, The Killers in December 2004 and October 2006, Nine Inch Nails on back-to-back nights in May 2005, Coldplay in May 2005, Oasis in June 2005, Usher in November 2008, Lady Gaga in June 2009, Arctic Monkeys in September 2009 and May 2011, 15-year-old Justin Bieber in November 2009, etc. =Restaurants= Immediately after his Stilife nightclub made a splash in the late 1980s, Khabouth began opening high-end restaurants in Toronto, seeking to transfer some of the upscale vibe from Stilife into the dining setting. However, especially when compared to his involvement with nightclubs, he's struggled for decades for similar recognition in the dining arena. Most of the criticism centers on the notion that his restaurants feel too much like nightclubs and are excessively flashy with too little substance i.e. exceptional food. Also, the fact that his late 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s eateries, some of them launched to major fanfare, only lasted a few years before either him pulling out of the venture or the venue altogether folding only further fueled the criticism. Despite significant investment and high profile launches, it wouldn't be until his partnership with Hanif Harji, a collaboration that began in early 2010s yielding 9 active restaurants as of late 2015, that Khabouth's dining venues such as Patria and Byblos have gotten very enthusiastic reviews for their food primarily. Personal In 1998, Khabouth married Libby Eber whom he first met during early 1990s while she worked as a hostess in Acrobat, a restaurant he co-owned with Franco Prevedello. They had two kids, son Charlie and daughter Maya, before divorcing in mid 2000s.

He had a significant role in the spread of tango music from the suburbs into the cities, where it became very popular.Frank, Patrick. Los Artistas Del Pueblo: Prints and Workers' Culture in Buenos Aires, 1917-1935, pp. 163-164 (UNM Press, 2006). Life story Born in Buenos Aires, he was a son of Genaro Greco and Victoria Santo, a couple of modest means who brought up Vicente and seven other children.Silbido, Juan. \\"Vicente Greco\\", todotango.com. Accessed November 3, 2015. This material is excerpted from the following book by the same author: Evocaci√≥n del Tango (Buenos Aires, 1964). The small family income caused Vicente to work at a young age; his schooling was interrupted, and he instead became a newspaper hawker, shouting out headlines to sell newspapers in the streets. Several of his siblings were also musically inclined. Vicente's musical career began around 1903 during his teens, when he played guitar complemented by singing, for fun. Greco learned to play a concertina that had been given as a gift to his parents, and then his parents gave the 14-year-old prodigy a bandoneon as a gift for the 14-year-old prodigy. The first tango he played was \\"La Tirana\\", and he initially worked in bars and lounges that were popular in the neighborhood of La Boca, one of the main neighborhoods of immigrants in Buenos Aires. He debuted in San Pedro, San Nicol√°s, Baradero, Rosario, and elsewhere. In San Pedro, he got to know and play music with leading performers of that era, including Prudencio Arag√≥n (El Johnny), Ernesto Zambonini (El Rengo), Lorenzo (El Negro) and Juan Borguessi (El Taruguito). But in San Pedro he also had a serious accident due to a stage collapse, and this may have contributed to his early death. Greco obtained a harmonium that he used for practice and for composing. He had dark eyes, and was short, with a tendency toward frequent good humor. He led the first group known as an orquesta t√≠pica, which means an orchestra specializing in tango, and that group was called Orquesta T√≠pica Criolla.Finkielman, Jorge. The Film Industry in Argentina: An Illustrated Cultural History, pp. 27-28 (McFarland, 2003). As a self-taught musician, he initially needed the help of fellow musicians to commit his music to paper. Among the venues where Greco played was the , in which, one evening in 1911, the tango \\"Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a\\" was premiered with a very warm reception by the audience, who followed their applause by carrying him on their shoulders victoriously along the street outside. Also in 1911, he was the first tango musician to be hired at the Armenonville, a musical cabaret that became one of the main centers of diffusion of the tango. His tangos sold well; 22,000 copies of his first tango \\"El morochito\\" (written in 1905) were sold, \\"Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a\\" sold 12,000 copies, and \\"El flete\\" sold 6,000 copies in three months. Numbers such as \\"Rodr√≠guez Pe√±a\\", \\"La viruta\\" or \\"El flete\\", were classics of the genre. The famous singer Carlos Gardel was his personal friend and a musical collaborator. Greco's recording work began around 1910. He was accompanied by the same instrumentalists with whom he had already appeared at the Caf√© El Estribo: Lorenzo Labissier (bandoneon), Domingo Greco (piano), Vicente Pecci (El Tano) (flute) and Palito Abatte or, on occasions, Francisco Canaro (violin).

The commune comprises an urban centre and twenty-two villages, such as Ciruelos, C√°huil, and Espinillo. It is located southwest of Santiago, the capital of Chile. Pichilemu had over 13,000 residents as of 2012. The Pichilemu area was long populated by the indigenous Promaucaes. European-Chilean development began in the mid-sixteenth century, as conquistador Pedro de Valdivia gave Juan G√≥mez de Almagro the Topocalma encomienda (which included the current territory of Pichilemu) in January 1541. Pichilemu was established as a subdelegation on 16 August 1867, and later as an \\"autonomous commune\\" on 22 December 1891, by decree of the President Jorge Montt and Interior Minister Manuel Jos√© Irarr√°zabal. Agust√≠n Ross Edwards, a Chilean politician and member of the Ross Edwards family, planned to develop it as a beach resort on the Pacific Ocean for upper-class Chileans. Pichilemu is home to five of the National Monuments of Chile: Agust√≠n Ross Cultural Centre and Park; the wooden railway station, Estaci√≥n Pichilemu; El √Årbol tunnel; and the Caballo de Agua. Part of the city was declared a Zona T√≠pica (\\"Traditional Area\\" or \\"Heritage Site\\") by the National Monuments Council, in 2004. The city is part of District No. 16 and is in the senatorial constituency of O'Higgins Region electoral division. Pichilemu is home to the main beach in O'Higgins Region. It is a tourist destination for surfing, windsurfing and funboarding. Tourism is the main industry of the city, but forestry and handicrafts are also important. Pichilemu has many expansive dark sand beaches. Several surf championships take place in the city each year at Punta de Lobos.  History  Pichilemu was inhabited by Promaucaes, a pre-Columbian tribal group, until the Spanish conquest of Chile. They were hunter-gatherers and fishermen who lived primarily along the Cachapoal and Maule rivers. The remaining Promaucaes were assimilated into Chilean society through a process of hispanicisation and mestisation after the conquest of Chile. Aureliano Oyarz√∫n, professor of pathology at University of Chile, investigated pre-Ceramic middens from Pichilemu and Cahuil. His book Cr√≥nicas de Pichilemu‚ÄìC√°huil (Chronicles of Pichilemu‚ÄìC√°huil) was published posthumously, in 1957. Tom√°s Guevara published two volumes of Historia de Chile, Chile Prehisp√°nico (History of Chile, Pre-Hispanic Chile) in 1929, which discusses the indigenous centre of Apalta, the Pichilemu middens, the Malloa petroglyphs, a stone cup from Nancagua, and pottery finds in Peralillo. Jos√© Toribio Medina (1852‚Äì1930), who was a writer and historiographer, spent most of his life in Colchagua Province, and completed his first archeological investigations in Pichilemu. In 1908, he published Los Restos Ind√≠genas de Pichilemu (), in which he stated that the Indians that were inhabiting Pichilemu when the Spaniards arrived at Chile were Promaucaes, part of the Topocalma encomienda, given on 24 January 1544, by Pedro de Valdivia to Juan G√≥mez de Almagro, therefore establishing Pichilemu. During the colonial and Republican periods, agriculture was promoted by the government. Many Chilean haciendas (estates) were successful during this time, including the Pichileminian Hacienda San Antonio de Petrel. Part of the land where San Antonio de Petrel was created was given by the Captaincy General of Chile to Bartolom√© de Rojas y Puebla in 1611, who later acquired more lands in order to establish it. San Antonio de Petrel produced leather, jerky, soles, tallow, and cordovan, as well as other products which would later be exported to Peru, or sold in Santiago and Valpara√≠so. San Antonio de Petrel was bordered by properties of Lauriano Gaete and Ninfa Vargas, and Pedro Pavez Polanco. The area around Pichilemu was very densely populated, especially in C√°huil, where there are salt deposits that were exploited by natives. Pichilemu has had censuses taken since the 17th century. Daniel Ort√∫zar Avenue, in 1925. In 1872, President of Chile An√≠bal Pinto commissioned the corvette captain Francisco Vidal Gormaz to perform a survey of the coast between Tum√°n Creek and Boca del Mataquito. He concluded that Pichilemu was the best place to construct a ferry. The family of Daniel Ort√∫zar, inheritors of the hacienda San Antonio de Petrel, constructed a dock in 1875, which served as a fishing port for a few years, and would be decreed as a \\"minor dock\\" by President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda in 1887. Homes were built along the dock on what currently is the Daniel Ort√∫zar Avenue (Avenida Daniel Ort√∫zar). The name Pichilemu comes from the Mapudung√∫n words pichi (little) and lemu (forest). During the 1891 Chilean Civil War, Daniel Ort√∫zar and the priest of Alcones were transferred as prisoners from Pichilemu to Valpara√≠so via the dock, which was later burned. The dock was later reconstructed and used until 1912, but it never reached \\"port\\" status. The inheritors of Lauriano Gaete and Ninfa Vargas, who were proprietors of the land which is currently Central Pichilemu, founded the town in late 1891 after conceiving the design of the city with engineer Emilio Nich√≥n. By decree of President Jorge Montt and his Interior Minister, Manuel Jos√© Irarr√°zabal, the city was officially established as an \\"autonomous commune\\" on 22 December 1891. Jos√© Mar√≠a Caro Mart√≠nez became the first mayor of the city in 1894, and regularised and improved the design of the city the same year. Caro Mart√≠nez held the mayor office until 1905. Agust√≠n Ross, circa 1915 Agust√≠n Ross Edwards, a Chilean writer, Member of Parliament, minister, and politician, bought a tract of land, and named it La Posada, in 1885. At the time, it was merely a set of thick-walled barracks. Agust√≠n Ross turned Pichilemu into a summer resort town for affluent people from Santiago. He designed an urban setting that included a park and a forest of over . He transformed La Posada into a hotel, named Gran Hotel Pichilemu, which has since been renamed to Hotel Agust√≠n Ross. He built the Ross Casino (currently a cultural centre), several chalets, terraces, embankments, stone walls, a balcony facing the beach, and several large homes with building materials and furniture imported from France and England. However, Ross was not able to build the dock he had planned for the city. He died in 1926 in Vi√±a del Mar. Agust√≠n Ross' inheritors donated all of his construction (streets, avenues, squares, seven hectares of forests, the park in front of the hotel, the perrons, the balcony, and the terraces) to the Municipality of Pichilemu, on the condition that the municipality would hold them for recreation and public access. The Agust√≠n Ross Casino, constructed in 1905, and the Agust√≠n Ross Park, constructed in 1885, have since become an important part of the city, and have been declared Monumentos Hist√≥ricos (Historic Monuments) by the National Monuments Council. After the creation of the Cardenal Caro Province, by decree of General Augusto Pinochet on 3 October 1979, Pichilemu became its capital. The province is named after the first Chilean Catholic Cardinal, Jos√© Mar√≠a Caro Rodr√≠guez, who was born in Pichilemu. Pichilemu was severely affected by the 2010 Chile earthquake and its subsequent tsunami, which caused massive destruction in the coastal zone. On 11 March 2010, at 11:39:41 (14:39:41 UTC), a magnitude 6.9 earthquake occurred northwest of Pichilemu, killing one person.  Geography  Aerial view of Pichilemu.

It is a member of the Solesmes Congregation in the Benedictine Confederation. History The abbey was founded by the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of St. Maur of Glanfeuil in France, itself founded in the 7th century. After its suppression under the French Revolution, that abbey remained vacant until it was re-established in 1890 under Louis-Charles Couturier, O.S.B., Abbot of Solesmes Abbey. In 1901, however, the monks were compelled to leave France due to the anti-clerical laws of the Third French Republic. After finding refuge in Baronville, Belgium (now part of the municipality of Beauraing), the monks began to search for a permanent home. After various inquiries failed, they finally settled upon Clervaux. In 1908, a vote was taken by the monastic chapter, which made the decision to dissolve the existing monastery, and to found a new monastery there, dedicated to St. Maurice. Construction on the new abbey, designed in the Neo-Romanesque style by Johann Franz Klomp (1865-1946), a Dutch architect based in Germany, was begun in 1909 (the local parish church in Clervaux was also being built to Klomp‚Äôs design around the same time). The monks arrived in August 1910 to begin living at the new site. In 1926, the name of St. Maur was added to that of St. Maurice. In 1937, the Holy See established the monastery as a territorial abbey, independent of the authority of the local bishop. This status lasted until 1946. For much of this period, however, the monastic community of Clervaux lived in exile, having been expelled in January 1941 from the abbey by the Gestapo, as part of their occupation of the nation. The monks were not able to re-occupy their monastery until 1945. The Benedictine monks who live here at present come from various countries. Together they constitute a spiritual community and family under the authority of the abbot. All of them lead a very secluded and retired life following the Rule of Saint Benedict. They divide their time between personal and communal prayer and work. The main emphasis lies on the communal chorus prayers, consisting of psalms and hymns, known as the Liturgy of the Hours and on the celebration of the Eucharist. The monks also help with spiritual activities outside the monastery when needed for religious retreats, substitution for clergy in the parishes of the diocese, pastoral care or dispensing of the sacraments. Some of the monks excel in intellectual and artistic activities. They also do manual work according to the needs of the monastery and charity institutions. As part of a monastic congregation which helped in the revival of Gregorian chant in the 19th century, St. Maurice Abbey has produced several notable recordings of this music performed by the monks of the abbey. Notable connections The noted Icelandic writer, Halld√≥r Laxness (1902‚Äì1998), converted to Roman Catholicism while staying at the abbey. The monastic community has supported a Catholic mission to Scandinavia for many years. A monk of the abbey, Dom Jean Leclercq, O.S.B., was a noted patristics scholar and helped to guide the renewal of Catholic monastic life during the last half of the 20th century. Another monk of the abbey, Dom Paul Benoit, was a composer of mainly liturgical organ music. Australian-based Luxembourg composer Georges Lentz wrote his one-hour solo electric guitar piece ‚ÄúIngwe‚Äù during a stay at the abbey.

Career The sixth son of Sir John Hill Bt. and Mary, co-heir and daughter of John Chambr√© of Petton, Shropshire, he was born on 6December 1781 at Hawkstone Hall near Prees Shropshire. He joined the Royal Horse Guards (Blue) as a cornet on 22August 1805 and was promoted to lieutenant on 6March 1806. Promotion to captain followed on 4April 1811; to major on 19December 1811; to lieutenant-colonel on 30December 1813; to colonel on 21June 1827 and to major-general on 10January 1837. After arriving in Portugal he served throughout the Peninsular War as aide-de-camp to his elder brother Lord Hill and was slightly wounded during the campaign. He was present at the Battle of Waterloo where he was wounded when a sword was thrust through his thigh, pinioning him to the ground. In India, he commanded the Mysore Division of the Madras Army under the Marquess of Tweeddale from 24November 1841. Death Hill died at the falls of Guersoppa in the Indian state of Karnataka on 20January 1845 aged 63 and was buried at Honavar on the 22January.

History  In June 2014, Mozilla released builds of Firefox with compatibility with Oculus Rift through WebVR, and in November of that year launched MozVR.com, a Virtual Reality Website showcasing web-based virtual reality demos, tied together with a virtual reality navigation interface. Experimental builds of Google Chrome also use WebVR to support Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, Project Tango and HTC Vive. In 2014, Google launched 'Chrome Experiments for Virtual Reality'; a Virtual Reality mobile site showcasing web-based Virtual Reality demos for Google Cardboard. In 2015, Mozilla released A-Frame (VR), an open source web framework for building VR experiences and websites. References Category:Websites Category:Virtual reality ","title":"Virtual reality website"},{"id":"48448275","text":"WebVR was an experimental JavaScript application programming interface (API) that enabled applications to interact with virtual reality devices, such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard or Open Source Virtual Reality (OSVR) in a web browser. It was implemented in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers before being deprecated and removed. The WebVR API was superseded by a more powerful WebXR API that is capable of representing virtual reality and augmented reality devices simultaneously. This API is designed with the following goals in mind: * Detect available virtual reality devices. * Query the device's capabilities. * Poll the device‚Äôs position and orientation. * Display imagery on the device at the appropriate frame rate.  History  WebVR API was first conceived in spring 2014 by Vladimir Vukiƒáeviƒá from Mozilla. The API's contributors include Brandon Jones, Boris Smus and others from the Mozilla team. On March 1, 2016, the Mozilla VR team and the Google Chrome team announced the version 1.0 release of the WebVR API proposal. The resulting API refactoring brought many improvements to WebVR. The last tagged version is 1.1, which was last edited on April 5, 2017. The editors of the document include members from Mozilla and Google teams. However some Microsoft members have joined, and are actively collaborating in the drafting process of version 2.0 for the WebVR API.  Design  The WebVR API exposes a few new interfaces (such as VR Display, VR pose) that allow web applications to present content in virtual reality, by using WebGL with the necessary camera settings and device interactions (such as controllers or point of view). The API has been designed to follow a certain path, which is very similar to other intrusive Web API like the Geolocation API. The necessary steps are: # Request a list of the available VR devices. # Check to see if the desired device supports the presentation modes the application needs. # If so, application advertises VR functionality to the user. # User performs an action that indicates they want to enter VR mode. # Request a VR session to present VR content with. # Begin a render loop that produces graphical frames to be displayed on the VR device. # Continue producing frames until the user indicates that they wish to exit VR mode. # End the VR session.  Support  WebVR 1.0 is currently supported in the release version of Firefox 55+ for Windows (64 bit version only) and was supported by Chrome for Android until version 80 as an Origin Trial Experiment, which means that developers can request a token to add to their website which will seamlessly enable WebVR. WebVR 1.1 is supported in Microsoft Edge from build 15002+, and in Samsung Internet, Chromium, Servo and Oculus Carmel. Chrome for Windows supports WebVR 1.1 in a special build. Firefox 55+ on macOS also supports WebVR if a setting is enabled by the user.  Similar technologies  Although WebVR is unique as an API, there are native applications on most hardware allowing for networked experiences and access to web content. Several key tools, such as Unity and Blender, are also able to export for the web and provide users a way to use their content without installing a dedicated application. WebXR In 2018, the WebXR API superseded WebVR, being designed for both augmented reality and virtual reality devices.

Mullins was born on March 5, 1927 in Boonville, Indiana, where his father was an industrialist and mayor; his uncle, George W. Mullins, was a mathematician at Columbia University. He was raised in Chicago after the family moved there in 1930. He was educated at the Lab School of the University of Chicago, served two years in the U.S. Navy, and then earned a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, all in physics, in 1949, 1951, and 1955 respectively. His doctoral research, supervised by Cyril Stanley Smith, concerned the motion of grain boundaries in bismuth. He continued his work on metal grain boundaries in his first job, at the Westinghouse Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh, from 1955 until 1960. He also served as an adjunct professor at the University of Pittsburgh in this time period. In 1960, he moved to the Carnegie Institute of Technology as an associate professor; his research there included work on surface scratching, crystal facetting, instabilities in shape formation of precipitates, and the effect of capillary forces on shape stability. Later in his career, he branched out to other topics beyond material science, including the distribution of lunar craters and optical caustics caused by the diffraction of light through moving water. At the Carnegie, Mullins chaired the metallurgy department from 1963 until 1966, when he became dean of the institute. Under his leadership, the institute started a department of biological sciences, merged with the Mellon Institute to form Carnegie Mellon University, and split into two colleges of engineering and science within CMU. He stepped down as dean in 1970, becoming a professor of applied science. He was promoted to University Professor in 1985, and retired in 1992. Mullins won the Mathewson Gold Medal of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers in 1963, the Philip M.

It is the largest hofje built in the 17th century.  Building  Three double canal mansions on the Prinsengracht are part of the hofje, but only the richly ornamented middle gate was used by the hofje pensioners. The two outer double houses are rental homes that add to the hofje's income. The gatehouse is an unusual canal mansion because the entrance is at street level, meant for use by the pensioners. Generally Amsterdam canal mansions have a staircase leading to the bel-etage.  History  The hofje was built in 1692 from the proceeds of the bequest by Agneta Deutz, who had purchased the land and named the regents before her death. She intended it to be used by old servants and poor relations. On the gablestone in front is inscribed: > Agneta Deutz laat hier haar liefde en godsdienst blijken > Den Armen tot een troost, tot voorbeeld aan de rijken > Anno 1695 On the top floor the regent's room has a view over the canal. There a portrait of Agneta can still be seen. The hofje had room originally for 19 pensioners. The garden has an old pump and is planted with flowers in the summer months. In 1964 it was expanded to 31 pensioners homes. Old women are still welcome to live there.

On 21 December 2011 she became the Head of the Parliamentary Committee for Security and Anti- Corruption. She authored or co-authored multiple laws, including the toughening of responsibility for violating the rules of holding rallies, tightening immigration, criminal libel and registration requirements for 'foreign agents' for non-profit organizations with foreign funding. In 2014, she sponsored a bill prohibiting rehabilitation of Nazism. Another law known as the Yarovaya Law required in particular that telecommunications providers record all of their traffic and keep the record for three years (later shortened to six months). The first version of this counter-terrorism bill would have made it a criminal offense to fail reporting suspicious activities potentially linked with terrorism.

Design and development The SET 2, Lieutenant- Colonel Stefan Protopopescu's design for a reconnaissance and bomber aircraft, owed a good deal to the Astra-Protopopescu reconnaissance machine that he designed about two years earlier. A contraction of his name to Proto often appeared in variations of the new type's name. This was more powerful, over 25% greater in span and differed in many details, but shared the same layout and some features like the tail and the wing bracing were very similar. It was a wood framed aircraft and only used locally resourced timber. The SET 2 was a single bay biplane with fabric covered, two spar wings of equal span and rectangular plan, though the corners were blunted. Mounted with almost no stagger (a horizontal displacement of just ), the wings were braced together by a pair of vertical interplane struts on each side, assisted by bracing wires. The lower wings, which unlike the upper one carried considerable dihedral, were attached to the lower fuselage longerons and the upper one was held high above the fuselage by two parallel sets of transverse W-form cabane struts. Ailerons, which reached the wing tips, were placed on the upper wing alone. It had a nose-mounted, Lorraine 12E Courlis W-12 engine water-cooled with a honeycomb radiator and a Lamblin oil cooler on the fuselage underside. The forward fuselage was ash framed, changing to pine aft. In the engine area it was covered with aluminium, the central part was fabric covered and the rear plywood skinned. The upper fuselage had a light, rounded wooden decking. There were two, tandem, open cockpits close to each other, with the forward one, from which it was flown, between the trailing edges. The upper edge had a rounded, almost semicircular cut out to improve the pilot's upward view and the lower edges had quadrantal cut-outs at the roots for downward vision. The rear cockpit had provision for a machine gun mounting. The fuselage tapered aft to conventional, unbalanced tail surfaces with a continuously curved tailplane and elevators positioned near the top of the fuselage. The fin and rudder were also smoothly curved together; the latter extended to the keel and worked in a rounded elevator cut-out. The SET 2 had a conventional, fixed tailskid undercarriage. A short V-form strut was attached to each lower fuselage longeron, joined by a cross-piece at their apexes, above which a single axle bearing the main wheels was rubber sprung. The wooden tailskid was also rubber sprung. Operational history The exact date of the SET 2's first flight is not known but the 2 February 1927 Les Ailes article notes that it had started tests \\"recently\\". The number built apart from the prototype is also uncertain but here is no known record of production or service. Despite promising early test results, development of the SET-2 was abandoned after an in-flight fire and forced landing during flight-testing.

Game-play The game relies on a series of 'guesswork' puzzles. The game contains references to media such as Portal, The Twilight Zone, The Shawshank Redemption, Back to the Future, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts, The Office, and Fraggle Rock. The game has different-colored lines of dialogue and emphasis on humor, like classic LucasArts games out of SCUMM. Plot The plot centers around a character named Randal, a sociopath and kleptomaniac, who becomes stuck in a Groundhog Day-esque loop. The game's dark humor has been compared to that of Hector: Badge of Carnage. Development Randal's Monday was the first video game of Nexus Game Studio. Jeff Anderson, who played Randal, described the game as an homage to early 2D LucasArts titles. While this game contains a character named Randal, it bears no relation to the character from the films Clerks and Clerks II, also named Randal and played by Anderson. In Clerks, Anderson's character was named Randal Graves, while in Randal's Monday, his character is named Randal Hicks, possibly a reference to another Clerks character, Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran). Critical reception The game has a Metacritic rating of 57% based on thirty critic reviews. PC Gamer wrote \\"Randal's Monday gets it painfully wrong, mistaking convoluted and crazy for funny and logical to the point of being tedious and infuriating to play even with an in-game walk- through for when you've had enough.\\" Meanwhile, IGN said \\"Randal‚Äôs Monday has a clever premise that deserves better treatment than it does in this crude, baffling adventure\\". GameSpot concluded \\"Randal's Monday is blind hero worship that ignores decades of design theory and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste thanks to its thoroughly unlikable, homogeneous cast.\\" In 2017, HobbyConsolas named Randal's Monday one of the greatest Spanish games ever released.

During 50 years, the building stays in the abandonment, sometimes serving as parking or as place of stocking or else as ground of adventures for the children of the district. =Renovation and reassignment= Abandoned from 1920 to the early 1970s, the place was bought in 1973 by Cocof who sold it to the French Community in 1983. The renovation work, started in 1984, ended in 1997 and Les Halles became a cultural center. It is one of the first industrial sites reallocated as a cultural complex. And in any case the first covered market. The Halles de Schaerbeek is one of the rare buildings with a metallic structure still existing in Brussels. Example of reallocation of an industrial place into a cultural complex, the Halles include three performance halls: the Grande Halle (capacity: up to 2000 standing spectators), the Petite Halle (multipurpose room) and the Cave (foyer, bar, multi-purpose space). Les Halles is ideal for circus shows, but their modular infrastructure allows all activities. They are very open to the neighborhood which is home to a multicultural and often disadvantaged population. Under the impetus of Philippe Grombeer - their first director, they have, since 1991, a vocation of European Cultural Center. Since December 2012, management has been provided by Christophe Galent (former secretary general of the national scene Le Volcan au Havre3).

In a letter to Pogodin he wrote: > ...I thank you greatly for the troubles you've taken concerning my > Hypochondriac.

Sovremennik (in an anonymous review the authorship of which was later ascribed to Nikolai Nekrasov) opined that the production was a success although the play itself \\"lacked even a modicum of thought\\". In 1857 the play was staged at the Moscow's Maly Theatre. The Theatre and Music Herald (Teatralny i muzykalny vestnik) called it \\"dry and somewhat dreary,\\" but credited the actors involved (among them Prov Sadovsky and Nadezhda Rykalova) with saving it by providing \\"most expressive performances.\\"–¢–µ–∞—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∏ –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫, 1857, 17 November, p. 622.

The first medium-duty trucks sold by the company, the FL60/FL70 replaced the Mercedes-Benz L-series trucks which were withdrawn from the United States market during 1991. The Business Class range was sold as both a straight truck and a semitractor. During the late 1990s, the Business Class would become popular in bus applications, in both cowled- chassis (school bus) and cutaway-cab configurations. In 2001, Freightliner introduced the Freightliner Business Class M2 as the second-generation Business Class, selling variants of the FL-Series through 2007.  Design  The first all-new medium-duty conventional truck range introduced in North America since 1980, the design of the Freightliner Business Class was derived heavily upon an existing product range. Using the mass-produced cab of the Mercedes-Benz LK (Leichte Klasse, light class) introduced in 1983, which had already been transplanted into other Freightliner trucks like the FLC112 in 1985 (with addition of a bonnet to the European cab-over cab structure), Freightliner began development on its first medium-duty truck, essentially serving as a replacement for the Brazilian-built Mercedes-Benz L-Series trucks sold in the United States. Freightliner had been owned by Daimler-Benz since 1981, and tooling up for the production of a crash-tested steel cab is among the most expensive items in truck development. Thus, sharing a cab structure is a major cost-saving procedure. Competitors from Ford and General Motors used pickup-truck cabs.

In place of the FLC112 (and most other Freightliners) named for its BBC (bumper to back of cab length), the initial models of the Business Class were identified by size range. The FL60 was a Class 6 truck; the FL70, a Class 7 truck. Later, the Class 5 FL50 was added at the bottom of the range. = Bus = In 1997, Freightliner began producing the Business Class for bus applications; the Freightliner FS-65 cowled chassis is produced primarily for school bus use. Additionally, the Business Class was also produced as a cutaway cab for non-school bus bodies. Following the acquisition of Thomas Built Buses in 1998, the FS65 was bodied by Thomas exclusively after 2001.

The abbey is physically located in the diocese of Essen, although not formally part of it. History The present abbey church originates in a small parish church built on an estate called \\"Havenburn\\" by the lords of Hochstaden in the 9th century. Over time, the landowners leased the land surrounding the farm to peasants who settled here. Soon the name of the estate passed to the entire parish. The parish of Hamborn later became an independent jurisdiction. In 1136 Gerhard von Hochstaden gave his possessions in Hamborn to the Archbishop of Cologne on condition that a Premonstratensian monastery should be built in the place of the parish church. After the conversion of the parish church to a Premonstratensian church and the construction of the cloister and the rest of the conventual buildings, the site was consecrated in 1170 and became an abbey. After the Napoleonic occupation of the Rhineland by the French army this monastery was abolished, like almost all others. While the monastic estates fell to the state, the church was kept for the people of Hamborn as a parish church. During World War II the abbey and the church were largely destroyed by Allied air raids. Abbey church As part of the re-foundation of the diocese of Essen in 1958 Hamborn Abbey was re-established in 1959 and settled by Premonstratensians from Rot an der Rot Abbey. In 1994 it regained its abbatial status. As of 2018 the community contains 23 canonsAbtei Hamborn: Konvent . Retrieved 13 April 2018 including the abbot since 1995, Albert Thomas D√∂lken O.Praem. The canons are mostly engaged in pastoral work in the Duisburg area, but in addition some are also active in the diocesan administration, in secondary and higher education and as academics, as well as in various welfare and social projects.Unser Dienst heute Besides its premises in Duisburg, Hamborn Abbey also oversees the Premonstratensian community in Magdeburg consisting of three monks, as an independent priory.Kloster Magdeburg The canons of Hamborn also undertake pastoral care in the former Premonstratensian abbeys of Cappenberg and Sayn. The steady growth of the community made necessary the enlargement of the premises of the buildings, and a new building was dedicated in 2011. On the abbey site are now also the Abbey School, the Abbey Centre, which is used in particular for conferences and cultural events and is equipped with a tourist office, as well as St. John's Hospital. The abbey is on the social front line of northern Duisburg with the notorious districts of Marxloh and Bruckhausen in an area that no longer has a Christian majority, and this sets the parameters of the abbey's social and pastoral work. Besides the abbey church with its sights, the treasury can also be visited.

History Negombo has been influenced greatly by the Christian faith from the time it was occupied by the Portuguese.

Features The church was built in neoclassicism style with columns and plain walls. Its ceilings are painted with alabaster images of many saints. The walls at the upper level are fixed with sculptures of religious saints. The unique paintings on the life of Christ on the ceiling were done by the N.S. Godamanne, a local Buddhist painter.

The game spawned two sequels entitled AnaCapri: The Dream (2007), and The Capri Connection (2014). Gameplay The gameplay is very similar to Myst, in which the player navigates through the landscape by click on a series of static screens; 4,500 real photographs of the Mediterranean island of Capri. The player must complete puzzle that involve tasks such as collecting plants, and finding ingredients for a meal. \\"The Capri Connection\\" takes 15‚Äì20 hours to complete. Adventure Mode sees the player have to solve a mystery while Walking Mode allow the player to freely explore like a tourist. Plot \\"In A Quiet Night in Capri\\", the player is a tourist visiting Capri in the hopes of having a relaxing weekend, but things start to take a strange turn once you arrive. \\"AnaCapri\\" sees the player return to the northern region of Capri, for an adventure that has a mix of mythology, literature, science fiction, history, and psychology. In \\"The Capri Connection\\", you play as Dr. Nico Fredi, whose mind becomes swapped with that of his alternate universe double Dr. Nick Freuds; the result of Space-Time rip from an experiment-gone-wrong by Dr. Costanzo Gravitiello. The player has to set things back to normal. Development The game was developed by a two-man father-and-son team, consisting of Silvio and Gey Savarese. Silvio became interested in games at age 12‚Äì13, when he began playing text-based adventures by game designer Scott Adams's company Adventure International, which inspired him to begin plotting out his own adventure game puzzles. His philosophy was to create something that would allow the player to escape from their everyday life. The genesis of the idea came from taking pictures all around the island of Capri. The pair subsequently began to play around with these images and try to create a larger whole. While Gey focused on the programming, Silvio's task was to work on the narrative. Gey was into science fiction, admiring authors such as Robert Scheckley, Jack Vance, and Isaac Asimov, as well as the concepts of time warps and time machines, so this governed much of the storyline. They also ensured that humour played an important role. After creating a demo of the work, they had to gain permission from the relevant parties to use all the photos. Due to Gey's lack of software knowledge, he settled for a simple interface that served its purpose and allowed the images to tell the story; they reasoned that if Adams' text-based games could be affecting with text only, their simple technology would suffice. Capri Municipality gave the duo permission to shoot in many iconic locations, and supported the game; for example they created a number of publicity events couple of events to promote the game's release. \\"The Capri Connection\\", the first game in the series made entirely by Gey Savarese, was also the first to utilise locations outside of Capri, including the Italian peninsula. The game went gold on 03/24/04 and was scheduled to ship to North American retailers in early March, shipped with a bonus CD soundtrack. Critical reception =A Quiet Weekend in Capri= The game has a Metacritic score of 63% based on 11 critic reviews. IGN wrote \\"It has pretty good sounds and a storyline that can only be described as different - in that it keeps you in the dark about just about everything throughout the game.\\" GameSpot commented that the game's \\"presentation does it few favors...it all seems very amateurish and cheap\\". Michael Zacharzewski of Gry Online thought the game was similar to the Polish Tajemnica Statuetki by Adrian Chmielarz. Gamezone felt it was a \\"definite bargain bin purchase\\", while Game Industry News felt the game was worth more than the money used to purchase it. =AnaCapri: The Dream= The game has a Metacritic rating of 39% based on 8 critic reviews. GameSpot compared the 2004 video game to the gameplay featured in early 1990s adventure titles, describing it as a \\"pseudo- nostalgia piece\\" that isn't fun to play. Game Chronicles reasoned that the use of real-world photography is proof that video games don't require computer- generated imagery to be enjoyable. This game features 2700 genuine photograph screens. =The Capri Connection= Gameboomers had reservations about the game, but complimented its ability to illustrate an exotic part of the world not seen in other video games. Adventure Classic Gaming wrote that \\"soaking up the breathtaking sceneries and exploring the remarkable culture\\" is an admirable way to experience the region. Meanwhile, Adventure Gamers said the game's \\"gorgeous\\" environments were cancelled out by its stereotypical characters and \\"cockamamie storyline.

She was most recently the director of Christchurch Art Gallery. Early life and education Born in Geraldine on 27 April 1950, Harper was educated at Villa Maria College, Christchurch. She completed a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Canterbury in 1972, a Diploma of Secondary Teaching at Christchurch Teacher's College in 1976, and a Master of Arts in religious studies at the University of Canterbury in 1977. Her master's thesis was titled The Relationship between Iconography and Mythology with Reference to the Hindu God, Siva. In 1982, she completed a Master of Philosophy (in art history) at the Courtauld Institute, University of London, and in 1983 a Diploma in Museum Studies at the University of Sydney. She married Frank Lewis Bailey, and the couple had one child. Career Harper began her career in art museums in 1983 as assistant curator in the International Prints and Illustrated Books department of the National Gallery of Australia. From 1983 to 1986 she was curator of European Art at the Queensland Art Gallery. In 1986 Harper returned to New Zealand and became Senior Curator of international art at the National Art Gallery in Wellington (prior to the merger of the National Art Gallery and National Museum to form the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa). During this time Harper curated exhibitions of the work of Barbara Kruger (1988), Cindy Sherman (1989) and Imants Tillers (1989). In 1988 and 1989, Harper was part of the Institutional Planning Team for the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, and from 1990 the director of the National Art Gallery, Wellington, until legislative change took effect in 1992 at which point she became the Director, Art and History, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. During 1994 Harper was Director, Museum Projects at Te Papa. In 1995 Harper left Te Papa to take up a position as Head of Art History at Victoria University of Wellington; between 2001 and 2004 she was Head, School of Art History, Classics and Religious Studies at the university and in 2004 was appointed Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic). During her time at Victoria University Harper was a driving force behind the establishment of the Adam Art Gallery, a project which involved the controversial sale of a major work by Colin McCahon, which the artist had gifted to the university, to fund a budget shortfall and provide an endowment for future collection acquisitions. In July 2006 Harper was announced as the new director of Christchurch Art Gallery, replacing outgoing director Tony Preston. She led the gallery through the five-year closure following the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, with the gallery not re-opening until December 2015. During the closure Harper led the crowdfunding drive to raise funds for the acquisition of Michael Parekowhai's Chapman‚Äôs Homer, part of the artist's installation at the 2011 Venice Biennale. Raising $206,050, the 'Back the Bull' campaign was at the time the most successful crowdfunding campaign in New Zealand. Harper gave notice of her resignation as director in 2017, taking effect at Easter 2018. Her tenure is noted for her fundraising efforts, in addition to increasing visitor numbers and expanding the gallery's permanent collection to have a stronger national and international remit. Venice Biennale Harper was the Commissioner for New Zealand's representations at the 2009, 2011 and 2013 Venice Biennales (featuring Judy Millar and Francis Upritchard, Michael Parekowhai, and Bill Culbert respectively).https://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/media/uploads/2015_12/JENNY_HARPER_curriculum_vitae_Dec_2015.pdf Harper‚Äôs CV Honours and awards In 1990, Harper was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours, she was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the arts. In 2018, Harper was awarded an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, the University of Canterbury.

It stars Ganesh, Remya Nambeesan, making her Kannada debut, and Rangayana Raghu in the lead roles. PC Shekhar had previously worked with Ganesh in the film Romeo (2012). The film's cinematography was by Santhosh Pandi and the music was composed by Arjun Janya. The film was officially announced on 12 August 2014 and it was reported that Ganesh would feature in two different roles. The film was expected to release on 25 December 2015 along with actor Yash's film Masterpiece. After multiple delays, the film was censored in April 2016 and finally released on 13 May 2016.  Plot  Karthik and Kashi look alike, but Karthik aspires to be a sub-inspector while Kashi is a criminal mastermind. What happens when they end up being in the same city with a bag of stolen cocaine playing games in their otherwise nearly-perfect lives? PC Shekar had all the right elements for him in the film -- a good performer playing a double role, a mafia setting, goofball villains, a nice comic ensemble, and a bag of cocaine worth crores to wreak havoc in the plot. Sadly, a film that could have been as good as say a Khosla Ka Ghosla or Aaranya Kaandam, using dark comedy as its main tool, falls just short of being that. This is due to excessive masala elements, be it through fight sequences, over-the-top comedy, and even an unnecessary item number. The story of a good guy and bad guy who look identical, with intentions of being a top cop and top criminal, respectively, is a plot that's often been explored in Indian films. But, Shekar gives his viewers a story with a twist. Sadly, though, he yields to most of the staple mainstream mainstays, be it the two duets and one item song routine or the multiple fight sequences, ensuring the film ends up being just another masala potboiler, rather than use the novelty that it has in the script. With it comes to performances, Ganesh is top-notch, giving his best as both the good and bad guy. Remya doesn't have a big role as such in her hyped debut. The comic ensemble does their part, especially Rangayana Raghu and Sundar Raj. Watch this film if you are a die-hard Ganesh fan or love your regular dose of masala-laden commercial cinema. Cast * Ganesh as Karthik / 'King' Kashi (Dual roles) * Remya Nambeesan as Ramya * Rangayana Raghu as Naga * Sadhu Kokila as Sadhu * Padmaja Rao * Mithra * Sundar Raj * Sadguna Murthy * Rajashekar Naidu Production PC Shekhar who had worked with Ganesh before in Romeo, initially titled the film as King. However, upon Ganesh's suggestions, he added the word \\"Style\\" to the title. The official launch took place at the Symphony theatre in Bangalore on 7 August 2014. Malayalam actress Ramya Nambeesan was roped in to play the female lead. For the supporting roles, Rangayana Raghu was roped in and for the antagonist role, Rajendran joined the team. Soundtrack The film's score and soundtrack are composed by Arjun Janya. The audio is slated to release in November 2015.

Gameplay The game engine, similar to that used in Post Mortem and Syberia, sees the player able to navigate through fixed locations, where one can then manipulate a full 360 degrees, and click to move to the next location. The gameplay is reminiscent of the DreamCatcher game Beyond Time. In order to solve the puzzles, \\"the player needs to think and experiment a little\\". Hexagon estimates that the game takes 25 to 30 hours to complete. The cursor indicates puzzles, paths, informational popups, and potential inventory items. Plot The scientist protagonist Jack Lanser commences a quest, and not soon after his body is body-snatched, and the possessor runs off with the player's girlfriend. It is up the player, now inhabiting a different body, to right the wrongs. Development The game was created by Courtland Shakespeare and Peter Faluisi. Hexagon Production Manager and head of Production Peter Faluisi explained the philosophy behind the game: \\"Players are so experienced today and know all the clich√©s and are a bit jaded, so it gets harder to surprise and entertain them. That‚Äôs what we wanted to do. We wanted to make everyone smile...with [the] creativ[ity] and original[ity of] old sci-fi stories and cult movies...and have some fun again while playing a game\\". The audio and music was done by Steve Sauve, who also worked Hexagon's previous game Jewels of the Oracle (1995). The development team used graphics packages like LightWave, Maya, 3DS Max, and Virtools Dev to make the game. According to Faluisi, \\"This allows us to do high-polygon count (hi-res) images for the 360 navigation nodes and the animations and also makes it easier to put together chunks of object oriented code with Dev‚Äôs Building Blocks technology.\\" Reception The game has a Metacritic score of 31% based on 10 critic reviews.

The band consists of vocalist Petra Mases, drummer Petter Nyg√•rdh, guitarist Jerker Krumlinde, bassist Paulina Mellkvist and keyboardist Oskar Bond. The band was originally conceived as a punk interpretation of American folk music. Francis has gained a following in the DIY community of Sweden as well as in the other Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, where they performed at the Fabriq Festival in 2012. Beginnings Francis has its origins in the DIY scene in Mora. During the break after their first album in 2011, released only in Sweden, the band members experienced several changes in their personal lives as well as changes in the lineup. Due to these changes, the band refrained from putting out a full album until 2016. 2015-Present: Marathon In October 2015, Francis released their first worldwide single, Follow Me Home, to be featured on their album Marathon. The band collaborated with producer Nicolas Vernhes to create a \\"crisp, lucid guitar-pop\\" contrasting with melancholy lyrics. The song focuses on lyrics at first and then shifts focus to the instrumentals. This single met with mostly positive reviews in underground blogs, with one reviewer proclaiming them \\"a name to remember\\"http://blogg.djungeltrumman.se/queclub/francis-follow-me- home/ and Follow Me Home a \\"5-minute wonder.\\" Musical style and influences The original founders of Francis aimed to put a punk spin on modern folk music, citing American musicians Tom Waits and Patti Smith. On the album Marathon, the band's sound evolved into a softer pop sound, and they began to focus on politics, including issues of xenophobia in Europe, as well as issues of gender equality. Band members Vocalist Petra Mases and drummer Petter Nyg√•rdh were part of Francis's initial makeup. The band's forthcoming Marathon will be their first recording to feature the current lineup.

She is known for her contributions for the revival of Mayurbhanj Chhau, a tribal martial dance form from Odisha. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian award of the Padma Shri in 1999, for her contributions to Arts and culture.  Biography  Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra. Shobha was born to Lala Charat Ram of DCM and Sumitra Charat Ram, the renowned art doyenne and Padma Shri winner, on 21 October 1943, in the Indian capital of New Delhi. After completing her schooling at Modern School, New Delhi, she graduated in Economics with honours from Delhi University in 1963, to start her career as a management trainee at her father's company, Delhi Cloth & General Mills, in 1964. Four years later, subsequent to her marriage to Deepak Singh in 1967, she left DCM and joined Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra (SBKK), a cultural organization founded by her mother, in 1952. While managing the Kamini Auditorium of the Kendra, she pursued her studies to secure the degree of Bachelor of Performing Arts and studied dance under Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj and Music under Biswajit Roy Chowdhury and Amjad Ali Khan. In 1992, she joined Living Theatre of Ebrahim Alkazi, former director of the National School of Drama and one of the most influential figures of modern Indian theatre, and studied theatre direction, securing a diploma in 1996. She continued her association with Alkazi and worked as his assistant for four of Alkazi productions namely, Three Sisters, Three Greek Tragedies, A Streetcar Named Desire, and Death of a Salesman. After the death of Sumitra Charat Ram in 2011, she took over the management of SBKK as its director and runs the activities of the Kendra, aided by her husband. Singh, a recipient of the 1999 Padma Shri honours, lives in New Delhi with her husband, Deepak Singh, and the couple has a daughter.  Legacy  One of the more significant contributions of Singh is her activities under the aegis of SBKK which runs the College of Music and Dance, offering courses in Hindustani classical music in Vocals and instruments, Light music vocals and dance disciplines such as Kathak, Bharatnatyam, Odissi, Mayurbhanj Chhau, Ballet and Contemporary Dance. Several renowned artists and art teachers like Ravi Shankar, Birju Maharaj, Amjad Ali Khan, Shambhu Maharaj and Shovana Narayan are associated with the organization. She is the organizer of Summer Ballet Festival, an annual dance festival, conducted in New Delhi. She has also instituted an annual award, Sumitra Charat Ram Award for Lifetime Achievement, to honour excellence in Art, Birju Maharaj receiving the inaugural award in 2011 Singh is an accomplished photographer, covering many of the functions of SBKK personally. She is reported to have exposed over 40,000 films, covering dance, theatre and music. Her first solo exhibition was organized by Ebrahim Alkazi at Shridharani Art Gallery in 1996. Since then, she has exhibited her works at various places, including the Triveni Kala Sangam, New Delhi and the Nehru Centre, London (2011). In 2013, Alka Pande curated her exhibition, displaying 250 of Singh's works at the India Habitat Centre on 25 March 2013 where a book, Dancescapes: A Photographic Journey, composed of 70 photographs, was released. She has also written a book on Indian theatre, under the title, Theatre Escapes: Experiencing Rasas.

Life Sheldon was born in Handsworth in 1862 where her father was the vicar (one source says 1860). She had two brothers who survived and four sisters. Her parents Ann (born Sharp) and the Reverend John Sheldon arranged for their daughters to attend Handsworth Ladies' College and remarkably three of the girls went on to higher education in Cambridge. Lillian Sheldon went to Newnham College in 1880 and two others to Girton College. Her elder sister Helen Sheldon became a notable headteacher at Sydenham. Lilian took two Natural Sciences Tripos examinations in Cambridge in 1883 and 1884. Sheldon conducted research on the development of the newt embryo with Alice Johnson and, as well, on the anatomy and morphology of Cynthia rustica (now called Styela rustica) and Peripatus. Her results were published in the Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science. Sheldon also contributed a section on Nemertines to volume 2 of the Cambridge Natural History series. She worked at the College as a demonstrator on morphology from 1892 to 1893, and lectured on comparative anatomy from 1893 to 1898. She was a College associate from 1894 to 1906. She retired from academia around 1898. She later published a number of articles on traditional Devonshire buildings in the Transactions of the Devonshire Association. During World War I, she worked for YMCA in Birmingham, where she was one of the earliest women drivers in the country. In 1931 her brother Gilbert Sheldon died. He had suffered from paralysis nearly all his life but he had published a number of books and travelled widely with his six sisters. It was Lilian and Walter de la Mare who wrote the introduction to his last work published in 1932. She also served on the local hospital committee at Exmouth. Sheldon died there at the age of 80.

It is a geographic sound consisting of a complex of sheltered bays, coves, estuaries and islands separated from the sea to the west by the Copoas Peninsula. The sound is within the municipality of Taytay and is an important feature for the ecology and economy of the province of Palawan. It is considered one of the finest natural harbors in the Philippines and one of Palawan's richest fishing grounds. The entire embayment and its surrounding landscape was declared a marine protected area in 2000 known as the Malampaya Sound Protected Landscape and Seascape. It covers of both aquatic and terrestrial environment with diverse ecosystems consisting of mangroves, coral reefs and seagrass beds, and a variety flora and fauna endemic to Palawan. The sound is the only known habitat of Irrawaddy dolphins in the Philippines. Description Malampaya Sound is about long in a southeasterly direction with breadths of between . It is separated into the shallow brackish \\"inner sound\\" and deep saltwater \\"outer sound\\", with the division being a group of 13 small islands, the largest being Passage Island, located in the narrow middle portion. The sound is partially protected from the sea by Tuluran Island (also known as Tumbod), a barrier island that is long and wide at its widest point, which divides its entrance into two channels: the wide Blockade Strait to the west, and the narrow Endeavor Strait to the east. The sound forms the coast of eighteen barangays of Taytay municipality, with Taytay Poblacion and Pancol being the largest situated on the Inner Sound. It is indented by several bays and coves and with a surrounding landscape characterized by moderately rolling hills. The sound is fed by several rivers supplying fresh water inflow namely, the Abongan, Alacalian, Bato and Pinagupitan rivers. north of its entrance is Custodio Point which forms the western border of Bacuit Bay in the municipality of El Nido, itself a managed resource protected area. The Copoas Peninsula, named after its highest peak, Mount Copoas at above sea level, is shared with four barangays of the municipality of San Vicente on its southern side. The Malampaya marine protected area is located some north of Palawan's provincial capital, Puerto Princesa. It is also the site of several Tagbanua settlements whose main means of livelihood are fishing and farming, particularly in the areas of Minapla, New Guinlo, Binga, Alimanguan, Pancol and Liminagcong. Ecology Malampaya Sound's waters, coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangrove coastlines and surrounding lowland forests provide habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. More than 156 fish species are found in its waters including commercially valuable fish such as mackerel, anchovy, crevalle, sea catfish, snapper, frigate tuna, rabbit fish and grouper. Crabs and stingray are also abundant in the sound and is also visited by dugongs and marine turtles like green sea turtles and hawksbill sea turtles. The sound is also home to three species of dolphins: the Irrawaddy dolphin found in the Inner Sound, the bottle-nosed dolphin in the Outer Sound, and Risso's dolphin found at Minapla Bay. The surrounding forested landscape consists of primarily dipterocarp trees such as narra, ipil, apitong, dao, kamagong and mancono. It is inhabited by several animal species unique to Palawan, including the Palawan binturong, Palawan pangolin, Palawan stink badger, Palawan treeshrew and Palawan porcupine. A number of endemic bird species are also found in the protected area like the Palawan peacock-pheasant, Palawan hornbill, Tabon scrubfowl, talking myna and Philippine cockatoo. Its forest also hosts the Philippine long-tailed macaque, Asian palm civet and the critically endangered Philippine forest turtle.

Bostrom investigates how to reason when one suspects that evidence is biased by \\"observation selection effects\\", in other words, when the evidence presented has been pre-filtered by the condition that there was some appropriately positioned observer to \\"receive\\" the evidence. This conundrum is sometimes called the \\"anthropic principle,\\" \\"self-locating belief,\\" or \\"indexical information\\". Discussed concepts include the self-sampling assumption and the self-indication assumption. As of February 2020, digital copies of the text can be obtained for free on Bostrom's personal webpage. Self-sampling assumption The self-sampling assumption (SSA), one of the two major schools of anthropic probabilityNick Bostrom, Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy (New York: Routledge, 2002). ‚Äî the other being the self-indication assumption (SIA) ‚Äî states that: : All other things equal, an observer should reason as if they are randomly selected from the set of all actually existent observers (past, present and future) in their reference class. For instance, if there is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer, while on tails it will create two, then we have two possible worlds, the first with one observer, the second with two. These worlds are equally probable, hence the SSA probability of being the first (and only) observer in the heads world is 1/2, that of being the first observer in the tails world is 1/2 √ó 1/2 = 1/4, and the probability of being the second observer in the tails world is also 1/4. This is why SSA gives an answer of 1/2 probability of heads in the Sleeping Beauty problem. Unlike SIA, SSA is dependent on the choice of reference class. If the agents in the above example were in the same reference class as a trillion other observers, then the probability of being in the heads world, upon the agent being told they are in the sleeping beauty problem, is ‚âà 1/3, similar to SIA. SSA may imply the doomsday argument depending on the choice of reference class. It is often used in anthropic reasoning. Bostrom, in his book Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy, has suggested refining SSA to what he calls the strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA), which replaces \\"observers\\" in the SSA definition by \\"observer-moments\\". This coincides with the intuition that an observer who lives longer has more opportunities to experience herself existing, and it provides flexibility to refine reference classes in certain thought experiments in order to avoid paradoxical conclusions. Self- indication assumption The self-indication assumption (SIA)Nick Bostrom originally used the term SIA in a slightly different way. What is here referred to as SIA, he referred to as the combined SSA+SIA is a philosophical principle defined by Nick Bostrom in his book Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy. It states that: :All other things equal, an observer should reason as if they are randomly selected from the set of all possible observers. Note that \\"randomly selected\\" is weighted by the probability of the observers existing: under SIA you are still unlikely to be an unlikely observer, unless there are a lot of them. It is one of the two major schools of anthropic probability, the other being the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA). For instance, if there is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer, while on tails it will create two, then we have three possible observers (1st observer on heads, 1st on tails, 2nd on tails). Each of these observers have an equal probability for existence, so SIA assigns 1/3 probability to each. Alternatively, this could be interpreted as saying there are two possible observers (1st observer on either heads or tails, 2nd observer on tails), the first existing with probability one and the second existing with probability 1/2, so SIA assigns 2/3 to being the first observer and 1/3 to being the second - which is the same as the first interpretation. This is why SIA gives an answer of 1/3 probability of heads in the Sleeping Beauty Problem. Notice that unlike SSA, SIA is not dependent on the choice of reference class, as long as the reference class is large enough to contain all subjectively indistinguishable observers. If the reference class is large, SIA will make it more likely, but this is compensated by the much reduced probability that the agent will be that particular agent in the larger reference class. Although this anthropic principle was originally designed as a rebuttal to the Doomsday argument (by Dennis Dieks in 1992) it has general applications in the philosophy of anthropic reasoning, and Ken Olum has suggested it is important to the analysis of quantum cosmology. Ken Olum has written in defense of the SIA. Nick Bostrom and Milan Cirkovic have critiqued this defense.

From age 3 to 6, she lived in Cairo, Egypt, where her father served as deputy chief rabbi. She is a graduate of the Bais Yaakov girls' school network. As a teenager, she studied tailoring at a Bais Yaakov professional institution. At eighteen, she married Rabbi Ezra Bar-Shalom, then taught sewing, and opened a fellowship for young brides for several years. In 1975, she began to study fashion design at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design, after her husband and her father had opposed her plans to study psychology at a university.

Description Buildings within the gaol include the Great Hall, the warders' quarters and the cells. They are arranged around a central courtyard with a hiring depot located in the centre. The entire prison area is surrounded by stone walls studded with glass from broken bottles. History The gaol was established in 1852 for imperial convicts transported to Albany as skilled labourers. It initially consisted of a cell block for convicted men and quarters for the warden. The gaol was built with rehabilitation as a key principle and served not only to house inmates but as a hiring depot. Convicts who were sentenced to transportation from England from between 1850 and 1868 often served their time in the gaol. Many of the convicts arriving had their ticket of leave and were hired to work by the free settlers. Many worked on building the town jetty, manning the pilot boat and building the road to Perth. The gaol was extended in 1873 and became a public prison, with other buildings on the site being converted to housing for the town magistrates. Aboriginal prisoners were moved into the prison as a result of the increasing number of escapes from the town prison in Lawley Park. In 1875, the Great Hall, the women's cells and additional quarters for the warden were built. The gaol was last used in the 1930s during the Great Depression as a police lock-up. By 1941 the goal was put up for sale by the Public Works Department as it was declared unfit for habitation. It remained in a state of disrepair, but was restored between 1989 and 1996 to become a museum. In 2007, late night ghost tours of the gaol started.

The methods of monetization may vary between games, especially when they come from different genres or platforms, but they all serve the same purpose to return money to the game developers, copyright owners, and other stakeholders. As the monetization methods continue to diversify, they also affect the game design in a way that sometimes leads to criticism.  Methods  Although there are several business models to monetize video games, they can be categorized into six major models. A video game may use more than one of these models at once. = Retail = GameStop, a brick and mortar game retailer Retail purchase is the traditional method by which games are sold from brick and mortar stores or online retailers. Customers pay for a physical copy of the game and any other game related peripheral devices required for play in-store. Retail purchasing has previously made up the bulk of game-related transactions, but it has been on the decline in recent years due to the rise of digital distribution and mobile gaming. However, the importance of brick and mortar game stores as a place for gamers to gather and show their passion still remains. Furthermore, some retail purchases may come with collectible boxes and possible in-game items to attract customers over digital download. = Digital distribution = Digital distribution or digital download is similar in practice to retail purchasing, but is different in venue. Instead of acquiring a game through a physical store, customers buy their games online and download the game's data directly to their devices. Many games sold through digital download are distributed by means of a third-party service that functions in the same way as a physical store, selling a variety of games from many different developers in one location. Valve's Steam is an example of digital distribution platforms for PC gaming. = Subscription = Subscription model is a business model where a game requires continuous, ongoing payments from customers in order to play the game. Games that utilize subscription often sell access in blocks of one-month increments or in multiples thereof. Once a subscription runs out or is canceled by a customer, their access to the game ceases or is reduced until they re-subscribe. This method is most often associated with games that require an online connection or services that require capital to operate on the part of the publisher or developer. An example of games that use subscription model is World of Warcraft. Subscription service is, on the other hand, not a direct subscription to a game but a subscription to gaming-related services. These services may include, but not limited to, monthly games such as Humble Bundle, temporary access to game library such as Origin Access, and access to multiplayer online session such as PlayStation Plus. = Microtransaction = Credit cards are a popular payment method for digital distribution as well as microtransactions. Microtransaction is a business model where aspects of a game's contents can be purchased to enhance the game experience for the player. These aspects may range among new playable contents, in-game currencies, cosmetic options, and otherwise unavailable or restricted gameplay advantages. Traditionally, these purchases tend to be relatively inexpensive but numerous in variety. Microtransactions are often common in social and mobile games where potential customers may be hesitant to purchase a full game, but more at ease with smaller, yet more numerous payments. Downloadable content (DLC) is a kind of microtransaction that expands the base game by providing additional contents. Depending on the game and publisher, a downloadable content may be a large expansion that greatly impacts the game, or a series of smaller expansions. These expansions can be either skins, maps, story, or even a new game mode based on the main game. Loot box is a variation of microtransaction of which the rewards are random. The player has no control over the rewards they receive for paying in-game or real world currencies although the game often shows a list of possible loots that the player may get from the loot box. The content of the loot box may range from purely cosmetic items with no effect on gameplay, such as skins in Overwatch, to powerful items with a gameplay advantage that otherwise the player has to grind to achieve. Some games may require the players to rely on loot box system to obtain characters and items more heavily than other games. They are sometimes referred to as a Gacha game. = Player trading = Player trading is a business model where in-game items and digital currencies can be traded between players on the game marketplace that allows the publisher to get a cut on transactions that players made. Most of the times, The publisher can get a percentage from every transactions, like Steam community market, or from a difference between buying and selling price of the in-game currency, like World of Warcraft. = Advertising = Advertising is a form of indirect monetization. Apart from aforementioned methods of monetization, indirect monetization generate revenue from other sources that does not directly come from the player. Most frequently, this is the placement of advertisements within a game; these may take the form of banner advertisements, commercial breaks in play, or product placement in the game. Games that rely on advertisement for returns usually are free-to-play or are cheaper than other games as their production cost has already been subsidized.Fields, Tim (2014). Mobile & social game design : monetization methods and mechanics (Second edition. ed.). Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press. pp. 139 ‚Äì 166. .  Impact  The video games industry continues to grow as it is expected to generate $138 billion U.S. dollars in 2018, showing a 13.3% increase in revenue from last year. In 2014, digital download model made up 52% of all game sales and overtook retail purchase, the long-time industry standard.Ipsos MediaCT. (2015). Essential Facts about the Computer and Video Game Industry. Entertainment Software Association. Retrieved November 29, 2015, from http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ESA-Essential-Facts-2015.pdf Recently, many video game publishers have adopted the games as a service model where a game continues to generate revenue after its release. As a result, a game tends to get extended support and more contents post-launch so that it can be monetized via other methods in addition to retails and digital downloads, allowing the consumers to make the most out of their purchase. However, since the method of monetization must be decided before the game production, it may affect the game's overall design and how players will interact with the game. Monetization trends like games as a service will shape how new games are designed, potentially making genre that are easy to monetize more popular than others. As a result, proper consideration of any strategy must be given during the design process. Improper consideration of balance between good game design and effective monetization can lead to either players feeling extorted by the game and its developers or a failure of the game to produce enough revenue for the game to turn a profit. In both scenarios, a game in question is likely to fail once on the market, the difference being whether it fails critically or financially.Scott Rogers. 2014. Level up! the guide to great video game design 2nd ed., Hoboken, NJ: Wiley. In order to fund themselves, many independent game developers raise money by crowdfunding. They can also use crowdsourcing to break down the cost of development by distributing the workload to self-motivated individuals. Another way for independent developers to fund their games is to release an unfinished game as an early access where the players may purchase the game at a discounted price before it is complete. Microtransactions have recently become a popular monetization model in massively multiplayer online (MMO) games. Previous to this development, the majority of MMOs relied on the subscription model, where users paid a monthly fee to the developer for continual access to the game. Some MMOs have had difficulty in turning a profit under this model however, thanks to too few subscriptions to cover operating costs. This has prompted several MMOs to experiment with alternative monetization strategies, ultimately leading to the adoption of microtransactions. While some MMOs continue to operate under the subscription model, many now have moved to microtransactions to ensure financial stability.Krystalle Voecks. 2009. Redefining MMOs: The massive money of microtransactions. (November 2009). Retrieved 2015 from https://www.engadget.com/2009/09/11/redefining-mmos-the- massive-money-of-microtransactions/ With this shift, numerous virtual goods and services in MMOs that may have previously been available through normal play under the subscription model now can only be obtained through real currency transactions and it was expected that the microtransaction model would continue to be used under this model.Juho Hamari and Vili Lehdonvirta. 2010. Game design as marketing: How game mechanics create demand for virtual goods. Int. Journal of Business Science and Applied Management 5, 1 (2010). However, overuse or improper application of microtransactions can make the player base feel forced to pay money and discourage them from playing, while the underuse may lead to too few microtransactions taking place to support the game and its developers. Indirect monetization has undergone a recent surge in popularity as well. Through a combination of the propagation of both smartphones and Indie developers, the mobile games market has flourished. Although it had only 18% share of the video games industry in 2012, mobile games account for 51% of the video games market in 2018. Due to generally lower development, marketing, and maintenance costs as well a large target audience of players, mobile games are able to survive on a smaller income than most other varieties of games. The process is risky, however, since mobile games may often be hit or miss in their success. Games that pull in large numbers of players do well thanks to their advertisement model while those that fail to garner wide appeal do not last long on the market.Anon. 2013. Not Just Hype: The Rise of Indie Game Developers. (2013). Retrieved 2015 from Some have also criticized games implementing the indirect model as many games are made under it that are of low quality, or are non-user friendly with their monetization methods so as to maximize their income at the expense of player enjoyment. Criticism Video game monetization has been criticized by journalists who see it as video game publishers being excessively greedy, in particular with the implementation of microtransactions. Games such as 2017's Star Wars Battlefront II have been criticized for gameplay elements that require extensive grinding which can otherwise be bypassed through loot boxes. The increasing adoption of loot boxes in gaming has led to some viewing the machinic as a form of online gambling, with many countries revising their laws in response.  History  = Before the 1980s = The tradition of video game monetization can be traced back to the monetization of real life games, before the existence of the computer. A game is usually constructed with players, tools and rules. The tools for the game were made by skilled craftsman, usually with valuable materials, as described in the history. Thus, selling game tools for money became an understandable business long before the development of video games. The history of video games leads back to the 70's and 80's, when arcade video games become popular worldwide. Following the same sales model of the electro-mechanical arcade game, precedents were set from the first arcade game to cost a quarter per play, Periscope (arcade game),Steven L. Kent (2000), The First Quarter: A 25-Year History of Video Games, p. 83, BWD Press, from the 60s, most arcade game machines are coin- operated. Players have to insert coins to play for certain time or certain lives. This can be classified as a type of microtransaction, and was highly successful during the golden years of arcade games. One of the most popular and influential arcade games, Taito's Space Invaders was reported to cause a shortage of 100-yen coins in Japan, 1978. By 1982, the game grossed $2 billion in quarters\\"Making millions, 25 cents at a time\\". The Fifth Estate. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. November 23, 1982. Retrieved April 30, 2011 (equivalent to $7.26 billion in 2015), with a net profit of $450 million. When the Namco released Pac-man in Japan on May 22, 1980, it became immensely popular from its original release to the present day. Later, it became one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s . =1980s= With the development of computer technology, the home computer industry has packed with competitors from 1980. The home computers started to prove their gaming capability not long after they were introduced to the public, since they are able to run multiple game programs, and release the full potential of the hardware. Compare with arcade machine, people are able to switch between games and play at their homes. Although early computers were weak in compatibility, the IBM PC compatible platform became statetake overeover the fragmented market and ruling the PC game platform. On the other hand, the Third generation of video game consoles, represented by the famous NES console released in 1983, was able to help the North America game console market recover from the major crash during 1983 to 1985. From the 80s, video games on the market were mostly sell in the way of retail purchase. Although the home computers were not specialized in gaming, gaming consoles were. Most games had to be sold in physical mediums, such as a ROM cartridge, a floppy disk or even a Compact Cassette. For the game console users, buying the hardware cost extra money, but they had more choices on games and suitable input/output device designed for gameplay. =1990s= While old retail selling kept strong at 1990s, new way of game monetization emerged. The CD-ROM and other optical discs were taking the place of the cartridge, became the major medium of retail games. The development of web technology and bandwidth in the late 90s made many online games possible. The web based game Adventure Games Live revealed the possibility of the game running purely on a webpage, ever free of charge. The handheld gaming devices were invented long before 1990s, but the Game boy was a milestone on portable game history. The remarkable game innovation in this decade created a series of game consoles and devices. Handheld game devices with no changeable cartridges were also widely sold. In those cases, buying the hardware and software went together. An example can be the Tamagotchi sold by Bandai from 1996. In the early 1990s, online gaming was only starting to emerge as consumer use of the Internet had yet to gain wide traction, and Internet service plans were typically based on time-limited charges. This effectively gated access to online games which were being offered in subscription model form. However, when America On-Line introduced flat-rate Internet access packages, that gate disappeared, allowing players to play online games indefinitely, which impacted revenue from these titles. One of the first examples of a massively-multiplayer online game (MMO) was Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands, a text-based multi-user dungeon (MUD), released in 1997. Instead of launching with subscription fees to cover operating costs, its creator Matt Mihaly sought other ways to earn revenue, and after offering a few high-quality in-game items for real-world money at an auction, realized a way to make additional revenue. From that, Mihaly programmed into Achaea what is believed to be the first microtransaction, \\"dual currency\\" system, where two pools of in-game currency are available, those that are earned in- game, and those that are converted from real-world purchases into the premium currency, which was the only currency that could be used to purchase \\"virtual goods\\" in the game. =2000s= In the first decade of the century, the game monetization was affected by the booming of the e-commerce, as well as hardware, software and other information technology developments. All kinds of online games and multiplayer games were connected through the faster Internet. The craze of MMORPG by made the subscription model a profitable way to support the game developers. Many browser games became free to play in order to attract more visits. At the early age of smartphones, mobile games were paid to download because there was usually no interface for a smartphone to install a physical copy. Standardization and the ubiquity of mobile platforms that allowed for easy purchases by customers, brought on initially by the iPhone App Store and followed closely by the Android Marketplace and other competitors, resulted in a wide spread move towards microtransactions and indirect monetization. After the social network became a big part of the Internet, more games started to take this platform as a way to sell or promote the game. The 2000s also introduced the concepts of microtransactions and downloadable content (DLC). In 2005, Microsoft envisioned the ability to buy digital add-ons for Xbox 360 games through the Xbox Live Marketplace, allowing players to purchases specific content they wanted at a low price ($1-$5) rather than having to buy a more expensive complete expansion; this would thus provide alternative revenue streams to publishers. Though some content was offered before, this concept was cemented with the release of \\"horse armor\\" pack for Bethesda Softworks's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in 2006, and subsequently followed by many similar content packs over the next few years. While many player expressed outrage at the cost of what was decorative elements in-game, the horse armor pack was one of the top ten expansions that Bethesda sold for the game by 2009. Oblivions microtransaction model was considered extremely successful, and was replicated in many other games that followed, with the \\"horse armor\\" establishing player acceptance of microtransactions in non-mobile games. = 2010s = In the second decade of the century, game monetization models using microtransactions and indirect monetization, moved rapidly towards becoming a mature market. Game production moved from focusing purely on monetization models after competition for player attention became more intense. As a result, the industry has widely moved from a direct focus on monetization metrics in game design to focus on metrics such as player retention and daily active users. This can be visibly seen in the decline in valuations of several prominent free-to-play companies, as well as by studying the differences in game design for top free-to-play to games. This approach is considered \\"games as a service\\", as analysts have found that players put more value in games that provide a regular stream of new content than a title that does not receive updates. This model helps to assure a long revenue stream from the publisher as well as to allow them to publish fewer games and reduce development costs while still providing new content to players, with the potential to profit twice as fast from the traditional model. This approach also helps to insulate publishers from impacts of discounts and sales on digital game redemption keys from third-party sellers by requiring additional purchase of content as part of their services to gamers. Digital River estimated that the industry's value in 2017 had tripled from previous years due to the use of the \\"games as a service\\" model. Take-Two Interactive, in an investor call in November 2017, reported that 42% of their revenues were from \\"recurrent consumer spending\\" in their latest financial quarter, obtained through the Grand Theft Auto Online component of Grand Theft Auto V, and the \\"MyCareer\\" mode of NBA 2K18, both which offer players additional content and activities over time. Take-Two anticipates they will be using this model going forward for future games. Ubisoft, around the same time, reported that revenue from microtransactions and other in-game sales exceeded their revenue from direct digital sales of games during the first two quarters of their financial year for the first time. The use of online passes emerged in 2010, primarily as a means to combat the used game market. While publishers could not prevent players from selling and buying used games such as through the retailer GameStop, they discovered that providing a one-time code within a new game that was needed to access online features, they were able to secure more revenue from selling these online passes to players that had bought the game used. Electronic Arts (EA) had developed the idea of \\"Project Ten Dollar\\", attaching content to a code packaged with the game for its upcoming titles for that year, Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age: Origins, and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Successful in this area, EA transitioned this towards limiting a player from online play without either having purchased the game new or purchasing its online pass for a used copy, adding this into their popular EA Sports titles, starting with Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11. EA justified this as necessary to support their online servers for these titles. Ubisoft followed suit with \\"UPlay Passport\\" system, followed by several other publishers. However, due to changes in digital rights management for the upcoming eighth generation of video game consoles and player complaints, EA ended its online pass program by 2013, with other publishers following within the next few years. Simultaneously, the use of season passes to assure access to a large number of downloadable content items that were to be doled out several months after the release of a game become popular. Season passes were priced to offer the items at a total discount than buying them separately, aiming to draw in players to purchase the passes who would unlikely desire to buy all the content separately. This can be seen as equivalent as pre-ordering the downloadable content, often without knowing exactly what that content might be. Publishers were able to gain another retail revenue by selling \\"deluxe editions\\" of games that included the season pass as well as other bonus features. The first such season passes arose from 2011 with Rockstar Games' L.A. Noire, offering additional cases and costumes, and Warner Bros.'s Mortal Kombat, providing access to all fighters to be added to the game. Activision followed a similar approach with its \\"Call of Duty Elite membership\\" for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 that provided access to all of its maps planned for the following year. Another monetization approach developed in the 2010s was the use of loot boxes. Loot boxes, which go by many different names, are earned by players as part of progressing in a game, can be purchased with in-game money or through real-world funds, or otherwise offered as promotional items; when opened (either freely or by purchase of a special \\"key\\"), they contain a fixed number of random in-game items, doled out based on a rarity system, and which may include both cosmetic items as well as gameplay-affecting equipment. Since loot boxes are designed as part of a compulsion loop in video game design, some players will be enticed to purchase more loot boxes with real-world funds, providing a further revenue stream to publishers. While loot boxes had been present in games prior to 2016, specifically from the Chinese game market and introduced to Western audiences through a 2010 update in Valve's Team Fortress 2, they were most visible as a result of the popularity and success of Blizzard's Overwatch in 2016. Loot boxes started becoming more common in full-price games, leading to several titles released in 2017 to be criticized for egregious implementations of loot boxes that were seen as anti-consumer, including Microsoft's Forza Motorsport 7, Warner Bros. Middle-earth: Shadow of War, and EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. Because of their random nature, loot boxes are seen by some as a form of gambling, and several national governments have banned or regulated loot boxes under gambling legislation, or are looking to implement such legislation in wake of the loot box controversy arising from Star Wars Battlefront 2. The fatigue over loot boxes led to a new monetization approach in the form of battle passes. Initially used by Valve's Dota 2, the battle pass concept was popularized by Fortnite Battle Royale in early 2018 and began to be used in other popular games. Battle passes provide a tiered approach to providing in- game customization options, all visible at the start as to avoid the randomization of the loot box approach, and requiring the player to complete various challenges and early in-game experience to unlock these tiers to gain the rewards; some games also provide means for players to use microtransactions to purchase tiers. Battle passes allow developers to roll in new content, encouraging players to purchase a new battle pass to obtain this content. Fortnite had proved a successful model, as while the game is free-to- play, microtransactions to purchase battle passes or to directly buy certain items have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars per month in revenue following their introduction. =Historical pricing of games= The pricing of video games historically has not be set by any fixed price point though the markets will tend to average to a common price for a top-end game, with games of lesser quality (\\"bargain-bin games\\"), or those made by smaller developers, such as indie games, sold under this point. Uncommonly, a game may ask for a higher price than the average but typically due to additional hardware or features sold. For example, Sega released Virtua Racing, originally an arcade game, for its Sega Genesis system by including the Virtua Processor used in the arcade machines within the cartridge itself, bringing the cartridge to a MSRP compared with the average for most Genesis games. Pricing of games is based on numerous factors beyond development costs. It includes publisher payments including their marketing fees, manufacturing and printing costs, licensing fees for consoles, distribution, and retailer cuts, as well as accounting for possible returned inventory. An estimate from The Los Angeles Times of the costs behind a game in 2010 showed that only of that price, approximately 45%, was based on the publishers' costs which included development costs. Some of these costs remain unchanged over time, but technology improvements can see factors like manufacturing and distribution costs drop due to new media types and distribution, while more advanced game features will require greater development and publisher budgets. Historically, the pricing of video games follows the trends of the industry. Initial cartridge-based games for the second generation in the early 1980s were around . After the 1983 crash and the rapid technology advance of consoles over the third, fourth, and fifth generation, cartridge costs also rose due to added costs of ROM storage and coprocessors within cartridges, bringing prices up to around the late 1990s. The fifth generation of consoles as well as personal computer games brought the introduction of optical media for game distribution, which was cheaper to produce. Initial games introduced on optical media were often priced comparable with cartridge games at around but after a few years, the price of these games settled to around . Upon the introduction of the seventh generation of consoles in the mid-'00s, publishers started pushing at a price point for games, which remained through to around 2020. However, these costs represent the initial purchase retail costs, and as described above, since around 2010, post-release monetization through DLC, season passes and other forms have become the common market practice with most AAA games to obtain additional review after the initial sale, in addition to collector's editions for initial sales. There are industry indicators that another price bump is expected to occur with the introduction of the next generation of consoles, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S, up to . This is primarily due to the more advanced technology that the new consoles offer that can more impressive games but require greater developer resources to commit to supporting those features. The price bump had also been one that some in the industry believed should have happened sooner, but there had been strong resistance to move off the price point without good reason. The price point was a minimum resale price maintenance that distributors of the high-end games set for retailers as it gave distributors and retailers an assurance of how much take of each sale they got and could plan their businesses around that, and moving away from that model without other market forces at play would be risky. Prior to September 2020, some individual games had been marked at the higher price tag. Upon announcement of the pricing and release date of the PlayStation 5 in September 2020, Sony confirmed that it was adopting the price point for some of its first party games for the platform.

Following the 1968 general mobilization of the ARVN, a large number of troops had their families living in close proximity to the positions they were fighting to defend, rather than far away and safely behind the lines. Accordingly, if the enemy appeared likely to break through the ARVN defenses, it was in the interest of the individual ARVN soldier to desert to guide his family to safety, but to the great collective detriment of the ARVN defense. Family syndrome was described as a major factor in the ARVN's collapse, and the second-most common reason for desertions. In one representative case, during the battle of Ban Me Thuot, the division commander pulled a Ranger group away from the frontlines and sent them to defend a nearby training base to protect his own family while they awaited helicopter extraction.

Morice was wounded in the night attack on Bergen-op-Zoom in 1814. Death He was killed at Quatre Bras on the 16th June, just before the Battle of Waterloo (18June 1815), as a result of either the inexperience or incompetence of William, Prince of Orange, commander of I Corps. Morice had been ordered to form his battalion of the 69th into square by Sir Thomas Picton, commander of the 5th Division of Reserves, when the Prince of Orange rode up and asked him why. He replied that they had been ordered to do so \\"not more than a few minutes ago\\". The Prince replied, \\"Colonel, there is really no chance of cavalry coming on. Reform column immediately then get back into line.\\" Moments later the French cavalry charged, whereupon Morice and a number of others were killed and the regimental colours lost. His death is commemorated in a memorial tablet in St Mary the Virgin Church in Langley near Slough, Berkshire.

Born in Ellenport, near Maryport in Cumberland, Sharp's father died when he was just over one year old, and he was brought up by his mother, helping financially by working in agriculture from an early age. He worked full-time as a pony driver in a coal mine from the age of ten, graduating to cut coal underground at eighteen.Joyce Bellamy, Dictionary of Labour Biography (vol.I), pp.296‚Äì297 Sharp educated himself and became an active trade unionist, but was victimised as a result, and had to relocate to County Durham to find work. However, he returned to Cumberland in 1872, and that year attended the Amalgamated Association of Miners' conference. Sharp was inspired to form the Cumberland Miners' Association (CMA) and affiliated it to the AAM; by 1874, it had 1,500 members, and he worked as its general secretary and full-time agent. Under Sharp's leadership, the CMA won an important strike, solidifying its position, and he supported the formation of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB), serving on its executive on several occasions. Long a supporter of the Liberal Party, he was elected to Cumberland County Council on its formation, and also served on Maryport Urban District Council. He followed the MFGB in switching his support to the emerging Labour Party, and stood unsuccessfully for it in Whitehaven at the January 1910 general election, with the financial backing of the Whitehaven Trades Council. Sharp retired in 1916, the union granting him a pension of one pound a week. He died three years later, in 1919.

Friends knew him simply as Jim Cook. Life He was born in South Kensington in London on 10 December 1900, the son of Charles William Cook, a coachman, and his wife, Frances Wall. Using a London County CouncilNew Scientist: 4 December 1958 scholarship he attended Sloane School in Chelsea, London. Cook studied Chemistry at University College, London under Frederick G. Donnan and Norman Collie. In 1920 he began lecturing at the Sir John Cass Technical Institute where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1923 with a thesis on the Anthracene derivative. He lectured at the Institute until 1928. In 1929 Ernest Kennaway invited him to the Royal Cancer Hospital where he remained until 1939. Research done at the hospital suggested that tar (as found in most cigarettes) contained carcinogenic components of a similar structure to anthracene. Cook gathered pure samples of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as 1,2,5,6-dibenzoantracene, benzofenantrene 3.4-and 3.4-benzopyrene, and was therefore able to demonstrate for the first time that even a purely chemical compound had carcinogenic properties. In 1939 he moved to Glasgow University as Regius Professor of Chemistry and Director of their chemical laboratories. He remained interested in carcinogenic compounds, but his focus now looked at compounds of natural origin. Central to his research was the clarification of the structure of Alkaloid Colchicine: a compound that has anti-cancer properties, but is also highly toxic. Searching for parallel but less toxic compounds, similar to colchicine, he synthesized and studied many artificially created compounds. In 1954 he was appointed head of the University College of the South West of Exeter, which in 1955 was renamed the University of Exeter, with Cook then as Vice Chancellor. He continued to collaborate on research on polycyclic aromatic compounds with carcinogenic properties, isolated from crude oil and tobacco smoke. He received multiple honorary doctorates: Dublin ‚ÄìDSc (1948) Nigeria ‚Äì DSc (1961), Ulster ‚Äì DSc (1970), Exeter ‚Äì LLD (1967) In 1965 he retired from the University of Exeter. Shortly afterwards his wife died, and Cook then decided to move to East Africa. In 1966 he became Vice Chancellor of the University of East Africa, which included colleges located in Kampala, Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. In 1970 the University of East Africa split to create three independent universities: Makerere University in Kampala (Uganda), the University of Nairobi (Kenya) and the University of Dar es Salaam (Tanzania).Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Wilfred Cook In 1970 he returned to England, living in Exeter. He died suddenly on 21 October 1975. Works The scientific production of Cook includes about 240 articles in specialized journals. Among the various honors, in 1954 he won the highly prestigious Davy Medal of the Royal Society of London. In 1963 was knighted by Queen Elizabeth.

On 17 June 2019, the standard definition broadcast was closed and replaced by SBS World Movies, leaving SBS Viceland as a high definition-only channel. Its flagship news and current affairs program The Feed airs Thursday nights at 8:30pm. History In a statement made by SBS in early 2009 they announced plans for the channel SBS World that would replace SBS World News Channel. On 26 April 2009, Freeview's website and advertisements showed that the channel would be called SBS TWO. On 12 May 2009, SBS revealed programming details for the SBS TWO launch. This included a 5-minute feature at 6 pm called SBS TWO Launch: What is SBS TWO?, followed by the Academy Award winning short film Harvie Krumpet. On 1 June 2009, the SBS World News Channel ended broadcast and went into a loop of advertising for SBS TWO before the official launch later that day. SBS had originally planned for the channel to focus on Asia-Pacific speciality shows, international children's programming and English learning programmes. On 20 February 2013, SBS announced major changes to the programming on SBS TWO, with a relaunch as a bold, provocative channel for younger audiences aged 16‚Äì39 from 1 April 2013, known as SBS 2. In June 2016, Shane Smith, CEO of U.S.-Canadian media company Vice, announced at the Cannes Lions Festival that the company had reached deals with international broadcasters to launch localized versions of Viceland‚Äîa television brand featuring lifestyle-oriented reality and documentary-style programming aimed towards young adults. Among the partners announced was SBS. On 4 October 2016, SBS and Vice officially announced that SBS 2 would be re-launched as SBS Viceland on 15 November 2016. Michael Slonim, marketing director of Vice Australia, stated that SBS shared Vice's \\"storytelling sensibilities and curiosity about the world\\", and felt that the launch would \\"help catapult Vice further into the consciousness of young Australians\\". The channel remains operated by SBS, but will include original programmes produced for the American Viceland channel, alongside existing SBS 2 programmes such as The Feed. Despite using the Viceland brand name, it has no corporate association with the international affiliates. SBS Viceland had a primetime share of 1% on its first night, up slightly from 0.7% for SBS2 the previous week, with the highest rated program Gaycation viewed by 51,000 people. On 17 June 2019, SBS Viceland had been moved to being an HD only service on Channel 31. Channel 32 will be used by the new SBS World Movies channel from 1 July 2019, also only in HD. An SD version of Viceland (alongside SBS and World Movies) continues to broadcast via Foxtel on the AEST schedule. Programming =General= In addition to expanded international news programs during the day (including bulletins in Hindi, Korean, Greek, Macedonian, Polish and Portuguese languages), SBS Viceland screens documentary series, drama series and international films each night under themed programming blocks. In April 2013, SBS 2 relaunched targeting a younger audience, now airing various TV shows, including Bullet in the Face, Don't Tell My Mother, The Tales of Nights, Russell Howard's Good News, South Park, The Midnight Beast, Skins, Him & Her, Threesome, If You Are the One (A Chinese version of the Australian game show 'Taken Out), Housos, The Office, Parks and Recreation, Adam Ruins Everything and Community. =Sport= From its formation in 2009, SBS 2 has featured all stages of the Tour de France with full broadcasting rights in conjunction with SBS One, as well as exclusive UEFA Champions League matches as of the 2009‚Äì10 season. In 2010, SBS 2 aired repeat matches from the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa with full broadcasting rights in conjunction with SBS One. The channel has also broadcast regular episodes of The World Game since the programs reformatting in August 2010; regular weekly shows, in addition to various major footballing events. Other major events have included the FIFA Club World Cup and various international cup competitions. In 2013 and 2014, SBS 2 was the Freeview broadcaster of the ANZ Championship's live Sunday afternoon match. It gave netball fans across the nation the chance to keep viewing the sport on free to air TV after Network Ten dumped it stating it was \\"insignificant\\" for mainstream media and \\"not a premium sport\\", which led to no broadcast partner for the 2013 season until the very last minute which saw SBS struck a deal to broadcast the 2013 & 2014 seasons in conjunction with Fox Sports Australia. SBS also had the rights to the ANZ Championship finals & International test matches on its free-to-air television network between 2013‚Äì2014. Later in 2013, SBS 2 began broadcasting a weekly live A-League Friday-night match and A-League Finals matches. SBS 2 aired some matches from the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in conjunction with SBS. Availability SBS Viceland is available nationwide in standard definition and HD digital via the SBS Television service. On 1 July 2019 the free-to-air SD feed was replaced by SBS World Movies, making SBS Viceland an HD only channel on Channel 31. SBS Viceland SD continues to broadcast via Foxtel. =SBS Viceland HD= A high definition simulcast of SBS Viceland, SBS Viceland HD, became available on 8 April 2017. The service is broadcast in 1080i HD in an MPEG-4 format on digital channel 31.

An SBS representative defended the service, noting that its target audience was engaging with the network through its digital and on-demand platforms. Logo and identity history The first logo for SBS 2 was inspired by the then-current logo for SBS with the \\"Mercator\\" symbol paired with the brand \\"SBS TWO\\". When SBS was renamed \\"SBS ONE\\" that same year, its new logo was based on the SBS 2 logo. After SBS 2 was rebranded on 1 April 2013, the channel received a new contemporary logo with \\"SBS\\" written next to an orange painted number 2. This logo was updated on 30 October 2015 with a bolder font for \\"SBS\\" and included the top half of the \\"Mercator\\" symbol attached to the top curve of the number 2. The logo once changed again after the launch of SBS Viceland on 15 November 2016. Although most international versions of Viceland have rebranded to Vice on TV, SBS Viceland retained its name due to it being fully controlled by SBS.

In 1864, he joined the Primitive Methodists, and two years later, became a preacher in his spare time, remaining active in the church for the rest of his life.Joyce Bellamy and H. F. Bing, Dictionary of Labour Biography (vol.I), pp.232-233 Martin attended night school and became an active trade unionist, working with William Brown to try to form a union of Derbyshire miners. Unsuccessful, he instead joined the South Yorkshire Miners' Association, becoming secretary of a Staveley branch. In 1876, Martin was appointed as sub-checkweighman at Fairwell Colliery, then in 1882, checkweighman at Ireland Colliery. When the Derbyshire Miners' Association formed in 1880, he transferred his allegiance, and was secretary of the branch at Ireland. From 1906 until 1917, he was president of the union. Martin also became active in Liberal Party politics, acting as its sub-agent for Staveley from 1869 until 1914, and later becoming president of the North East Derbyshire Liberal Association. In 1894, he was elected to Staveley Parish Council, and from 1896 until 1913, he chaired the council. He agreed to stand as a Labour Party candidate in the 1914 North East Derbyshire by-election, in line with union policy, and left his Liberal Party posts, but he was not elected. Suffering poor health, Martin left his union posts in 1917, living out his final years in a nursing home in nearby Sheffield.

These judgments can be made using a variety of cues, including brief interactions with the target, video recordings of the target, photographs of the target, and observations of the target's personal environments, among others. In zero- acquaintance studies, the target's actual personality is determined through the target's self-rating and/or ratings from close acquaintance(s) of that target. Consensus in ratings is determined by how consistently perceivers rate the target's personality when compared to other raters. Accuracy in ratings is determined by how well perceivers' ratings of a target compare to that target's self-ratings on the same scale, or to that target's close acquaintances' ratings of the target. Zero-acquaintance judgments are regularly made in day-to-day life. Given that these judgments tend to remain stable, even as the length of interaction increases, they can influence important interpersonal outcomes.  Background = History = The study of zero-acquaintance personality judgments developed from Cleeton and Knight's (1924) intent to demonstrate the futility of using physical criteria to predict unobservable individual traits. In order to accomplish this, Cleeton and Knight (1924) recruited 30 target participants from national fraternities and sororities, so that a large group of close acquaintances from these organizations could rate eight traits (i.e. individual traits included sound judgment, intellectual capacity, frankness, willpower, ability to make friends, leadership, originality, and impulsiveness) of the target participants. Cleeton and Knight (1924) then asked a group of strangers to rate these eight traits of each target participant after viewing the target participant from a distance for only a few minutes. After measuring several objective physical traits of the target participants, such as cranium size and eye width, Cleeton and Knight (1924) found that these physical traits were unrelated to close acquaintances' ratings of unobservable individual traits. However, they found that strangers' rating of an unfamiliar individual's traits were reliable; strangers tended to rate a target's personality similarly. Although these ratings were inaccurate, it became apparent that raters must be using similar indicators to make judgements about individual traits. Passini and Norman (1966) found comparable evidence that strangers provide similar ratings of unobservable personality traits of a target participant with no prior acquaintanceship. In an introductory undergraduate psychology course, students with no previous interactions were placed into groups and asked to complete personality ratings for each member in the group. Given that the strangers tended to rate a target participant's personality similarly, Passini and Norman (1966) posited that some common observable characteristics must be informing these judgements. In the same year, Taft (1966) demonstrated that strangers can make judgments of personality more accurately than chance, but not as accurately as close acquaintances. These findings went unnoticed for over twenty years, until Albright, Kenny, and Malloy (1988) revived interest and formally coined the term zero-acquaintance personality judgments. These researchers established that certain physical appearance variables, including attractiveness, type of dress (both formal and neatness), and perceived age, informed strangers' zero-acquaintance personality judgments. Ratings between strangers were most similar to each other and to the target's self-rating for the traits \\"sociable\\" and \\"responsible\\". Ratings of target attractiveness informed judgements of sociability; formality and neatness of dress informed judgements of responsibility. =Consensus in ratings = Consensus in zero-acquaintance studies refers to the degree to which multiple perceivers of a target make similar judgments of that target's personality traits. Even from a momentary interaction, multiple perceivers can come to the same conclusion about aspects of a person's personality. A few different explanations exist for this phenomenon. One such explanation is called similar meaning systems. This explanation posits that consensus arises when raters agree on the meaning of the information they use to make personality judgments. Some aspect of the individual (such as facial expressions or posture) appears to have the same meaning to each perceiver. For example, a smile or an erect stance might be an indicator of extraversion (one of the five traits in the five-factor model of personality to all perceivers, therefore these raters will all provide similar extraversion ratings. This does not necessarily mean that the ratings are accurate, just that all perceivers rated the individual similarly. Stereotypes also influence consensus across perceivers. If perceivers of a target individual hold the same stereotypes about the target and use them in making personality judgments, consensus will be higher. For example, one gender may be stereotypically considered less emotionally stable than the other (neuroticism). Assuming perceivers hold this stereotype, they will make similar emotional stability ratings when the target's gender is known. Again, this does not assume that the stereotype is valid. In fact, some common stereotypes may prove to be invalid; use of such a stereotype by multiple perceivers will result in consistent, but inaccurate ratings (or high consensus and low accuracy). It is worth noting that different personality traits show different levels of consensus. Of the traits in the Five Factor Model of personality, conscientiousness and extraversion tend to show higher levels of consensus, while agreeableness tends to demonstrate the least consensus. These patterns of findings suggest that some traits are more easily judged from brief interactions and more likely to be agreed upon than others. For example, facial expressions, which often indicate levels of extraversion, are easily detected in brief meetings, pictures, or video clips; perceivers tend to agree on what traits these facial expressions convey. Therefore, consensus tends to be higher for extraversion. Consensus can also result from beliefs about the target's physical attractiveness and traits commonly associated with attractive individuals. For example, extraversion is often associated with physical attractiveness. Because perceivers tend to agree on targets' physical attractiveness, consensus for extraversion is generally high. Studies examining these differences in consensus across the Big Five traits have found that consensus ratings for extraversion tend to be around .27, compared to consensus of .03 for agreeableness. These numbers indicate how similarly raters view the same target's personality, with higher numbers indicating greater consensus for a particular trait. For agreeableness (with a consensus score of .03), there was virtually no agreement across raters of the target's level of agreeableness. For extraversion, (.27), there was much more consensus about the target's level of extraversion. Studies have also examined the differences in consensus for zero-acquaintance raters and raters who have been long acquainted with the target. For extraversion, consensus ratings seem to be similar (.27 for zero-acquaintance and .29 for long-term acquaintance). For all other traits, long-term acquaintance ratings tend to converge much more than for zero-acquaintance ratings. For example, ratings of agreeableness demonstrate consensus estimates of .27 when long-term acquaintances are the raters, compared to .03 when there are zero-acquaintance raters. Those who are familiar with the target individual tend to agree about their personality traits much more than individuals who do not know the target, with the exception of extraversion. These study findings suggest that extraversion is a fairly observable trait for any person, whether they know the target or not, and people interpret social cues related to extraversion quite similarly. = Accuracy in ratings = To determine if the perceiver in a zero-acquaintance context has made an accurate judgment of a target's personality, perceiver ratings are compared to the target's own ratings of their personality. The degree to which these two ratings converge is known as accuracy. Peer ratings (from people who have frequent contact with the individual being rated) can also be used to determine accuracy; if perceiver ratings of a target converge with peer ratings of the target, accuracy has been established. Accuracy is achieved when perceivers use what is known as \\"good information\\" about the target to make ratings. Information is \\"good\\" when it actually represents the trait being rated. For example, if a smile is actually reflective of extraversion, accuracy will be increased when perceivers use smiles to influence their extraversion ratings. This notion is known as the Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM; David C. Funder). When perceivers utilize good information in their ratings and ignore bad or irrelevant information, accuracy increases. As mentioned above, both self-ratings and peer-ratings of a target can be used to calculate accuracy; in fact, several researchers suggest it is best to combine self-reports and peer reports when measuring accuracy (self-report inventory). This helps eliminate the flaws of each measure on its own and can increase confidence that the accuracy measure is itself accurate. This combined rating (usually an average of peer- and self- score) is then correlated with the zero-acquaintance perceiver ratings to determine accuracy, in what has been termed the \\"Gold Standard\\" in personality research; Like consensus, accuracy is greater for some traits than others. In fact, a similar pattern to consensus exists, with extraversion and conscientiousness ratings tending to be the most accurate and agreeableness and openness ratings the least accurate of the five-factor model of personality. This is likely due to the trait-relevant information available to perceivers in zero-acquaintance settings. For example, in photographs there is more information present that accurately reflects conscientiousness and extraversion (such as cleanliness and facial expressions), than that which reflects agreeableness or openness. Sociability-related traits have typically been found to be the easiest to judge when raters have little acquaintance with targets. Since extraversion largely measures social tendencies, it makes sense that the highest consensus and accuracy are found for this trait. Extraversion ratings by peer raters who had little interaction with targets demonstrated validities of .35, compared to validities of .01 for agreeableness. This stark difference in validity suggests that agreeableness is much harder to judge with accuracy when the rater is unfamiliar with the target. Conscientiousness has also demonstrated relatively high accuracy when the rater is unacquainted, with a validity of .29. The validity coefficient tells us how related the raters' judgments are to the target's own ratings of their personality. A validity coefficient of .35 (such as for extraversion) is fairly high, compared to a validity coefficient of .01, which indicates that there is absolutely no relationship between the two sets of ratings. When raters are not very acquainted with the targets they are rating, it appears that the length of time they are actually able to observe the person doesn't have a strong influence on the accuracy of the behavioral judgments made. When raters have as little as 30 seconds to make a judgment about a target, they have the same level of accuracy as when they have four to five hours. This suggests that several cues about a person can be displayed in very short window of time. Across all ratings in all time windows, accuracy was .39, which is similar to the results of other zero-acquaintance studies. It is also important to note that while zero-acquaintance judgments can be accurate and particular traits are easy to judge, research generally shows that the greater acquaintance someone has with the target, the more accurate their ratings are. A classic study showed that the Big Five traits on average have higher validity for acquaintances (.40) than strangers (.29). This is a 38% increase in accuracy for acquaintances, compared to strangers. A later study examined this same topic over an extended period of time in order to better test an \\"acquaintance effect\\" on ratings. When people were asked to rate targets at multiple points in time, their ratings became more accurate (more similar to the targets' self-ratings) over time, as they got to know the target better. At weeks 1, 4, and 7, accuracy in ratings across the Big Five traits increased from .21 to .26, to .30, respectively. This demonstrates the phenomenon known as the acquaintance effect: over time, as people get to know someone better, they are better able to estimate that target's true personality. = Recent research = Recent research employing zero-acquaintance situations has largely focused on what traits are judged most consistently and accurately, and in what contexts. The most common contexts for zero-acquaintance judgments are those that allow for the observation of a target's physical appearance. Information about physical attributes is generally garnered in one of two ways: observation or photographs. Observation ratings typically come from video or sound recordings. For example, Borkenau and Liebler (1992) asked perceivers to view either a silent video, audio video, or just audio of targets entering a room, sitting down, and reading a script. Perceivers provided the most accurate judgements for extraversion and agreeableness with both audio and visual cues; conscientiousness was most accurate with visual cues alone. Interest in photographs has continued to increase in recent years, given the widespread use of these images on social media sites. For example, Naumann, Vazire, Rentfrow, and Gosling (2009) found that perceivers can make more accurate judgments of targets when these targets appear in spontaneous or \\"strike a pose\\" photographs than in non-expressive full body photographs. Specifically, perceivers were only able to accurately judge extraversion, self-esteem, and religiosity using a non-expressive full body photograph. When the target struck a pose, however, the perceiver was able to judge extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability, openness, likeability, self- esteem, loneliness, religiosity, and political orientation with some degree of accuracy. In a more recent study exploring the accuracy of personality judgments in selfie profile pictures, Qiu, Lu, Yang, Qu, and Zhu (2015) found that perceivers only accurately predict openness from selfies; these ratings were formed through impressions of the target's emotional positivity. Zero- acquaintance personality judgments can also be made through other artifacts, such as personal belongings or social media profiles. Gosling and colleagues (2002) found that perceivers can more accurately rate targets' personality by observing their bedrooms than their offices. When observing the bedrooms, perceivers could accurately rate extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience. When observing the offices, however, perceivers could only accurately rate extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. The researchers also found which cues informed which rating of personality. For instance, neatness informed judgments of conscientiousness, whereas variety and quantity of books informed judgements of openness to experience. More recently, Back et al. (2010) investigated how well perceivers could make judgements of targets by viewing their social media profiles, either on Facebook or StudiVZ. The researchers found that perceivers could accurately predict extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness of a target by simply perusing the social media profile.  Implications and unanswered questions  Personality judgments made in zero-acquaintance contexts are extremely common in day-to-day life. As can be seen from the studies referenced previously, personality impressions can be formed from extremely brief interactions, physical appearance, and personal environments. As the world becomes increasingly virtual, these zero-acquaintance judgments are becoming even more popular, as people turn to online profiles to infer people's personalities for use in both professional and interpersonal contexts. These judgments can have important implications, as they can influence the decision to further engage with an individual, and how so. For example, when employees were presented with the job application and picture of a fictitious future manager, their zero-acquaintance judgments of personality predicted these employees' willingness to work under this hypothetical manager. Furthermore, research has indicated that these first personality impressions remain relatively stable over time, even as the extent of interaction with the target person increases over time. In other words, the first impressions created in zero-acquaintance contexts are hard to change, and thus are predictive of further outcomes. For example, student impressions of an instructor on the first day of class were shown to be relatively consistent with impressions after the class had concluded, and thus these judgments predicted student course evaluations. Additionally, interviewer first impressions of interviewees have been shown to influence the amount of information provided by the interviewer during the interview, as well as the communication style and rapport established. Despite research demonstrating the stability of these zero-acquaintance judgments, as well as their accuracy and consensus, many questions still remain. For example, researchers have just begun to examine how different forms of zero- acquaintance judgments compare to one another. In other words, it is likely that one trait may be better judged in a particular context (e.g. photographs) while a different trait may be more accurately judged via a different context (e.g. video recordings). More research is needed in order to determine exactly which traits are best judged in which contexts. Additionally, it is possible that different zero-acquaintance contexts may provide conflicting information regarding the same trait. If a perceiver encounters both sources of information, it is unknown which source would be emphasized in the perceiver's judgments. Additionally, the weight that any particular perceiver attributes to one source over another may be influenced by characteristics of that perceiver or of the situation, and future research is needed to investigate this possibility. Finally, the role of culture and demographics in zero- acquaintance judgments has been identified as an area ripe for further studies. Perceivers from different cultures may judge the same source of information in different ways. Additionally, some sources of information (e.g. writing samples) portray culture and demographics to a lesser extent than others (e.g. photographs), which may lead to important differences in the judgments made. While research has begun to delve into these questions, many remain unanswered.

It is patterned on the Reims Cathedral in France, and is built in Gothic Revival style. Saint Sebastian is the patron saint of the city of Negombo.  Location  The church is located on the San Sebastian street in Negombo.  History  The church was designed by Father G. Gannon, parish priest of Sea Street. Although the foundation stone was laid by the Archbishop of Colombo, Pierre- Guillaume Marque, on 2 February 1936, construction was not completed until ten years later. It replaced a smaller church to accommodate the increasing number of parishioners in the catholic majority city. It is said to be modeled in Gothic Revival style on the lines of the Reims Cathedral in France. A shadow of this church is seen in the Negombo Lagoon. This church is one of the many churches in Sri Lanka dedicated to St Sebastian who is considered a martyr in the Catholic Church history. His veneration is particularly celebrated seeking relief from epidemics. A festival called the \\"Feast of St Sebastian\\" is held every year here during the month of January. A tali drama narrating the Life of Sebastian used to be enacted here before 1950. Now, \\"Raja Tunkattuwa\\", a Sinhalese language drama about the Three Kings is held here during Christmas.  Festival  At the St. Sebastian Church an annual festival dedicated to St. Sebastian is held on 20 January. On this occasion a decorated flagstaff is affixed at the church premises. Processions are also organized and food is served free to poor people.

She showed very promising form as a two-year-old in 2013 when she won the Delta Princess Stakes on the dirt. After a disappointing three-year-old season when she failed to win in four starts, she emerged as a top-class turf performer in 2015. Her wins as a four-year-old included the Churchill Distaff Turf Mile Stakes, Just A Game Stakes and First Lady Stakes before recording her biggest success when defeating male opposition in the Breeders' Cup Mile. In 2016, she won her first four starts and was then sent to England, where she defeated a field of leading European milers to win the Queen Anne Stakes. On returning to North America, she extended her winning streak to eight in the Woodbine Mile. The streak included three Grade/Group 1 wins against male horses in three different countries. Although Tepin finished second in her next two starts including an effort to defend her title in the Breeders Cup Mile, she was still named the Champion Female Turf Horse for the second year in a row. Background Tepin is a bay mare with three white socks and a small white star who was bred in Kentucky by Machmer Hall. She was sired by the sprinter Bernstein, who won the Railway Stakes and the Concorde Stakes when trained in Ireland by Aidan O'Brien. His most notable other progeny has been Karakontie, who won the Breeders' Cup Mile in 2014. Her dam Life Happened was an unraced daughter of another O'Brien sprinter Stravinsky: before foaling Tepin she had produced the colt Vyjack, whose wins included the Jerome Stakes and the Kelso Handicap. She was descended from the mare Omayya, who was the ancestor of many important winners including the Melbourne Cup winner Americain and the Irish Oaks winner Melodist. As a yearling Tepin was consigned to the Fasig-Tipton sale at Saratoga in August and was bought for $140,000 by Robert E. Masterson. She was sent into training with Mark Casse, who was inducted into the Canadian Racing Hall Of Fame in 2016. As Casse is based at Woodbine in Canada and Tepin was based in the U.S., much of her day-to-day training was handled by his son, Norman Casse. Tepin is named for the street on which Masterson lives, not the pepper. Her nickname is the \\"Queen of the Turf\\". Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= Tepin began her racing career by finishing fourth in a six furlong maiden race on the dirt at Churchill Downs on September 7 2013. In October she contested a maiden over seven furlongs on the synthetic track at Keeneland and recorded her first victory, taking the lead in the stretch and coming home three and a quarter lengths clear of Adellusion. Later that month she returned to Churchill Downs and finished third to Clever Beauty in the one mile Rags To Riches Stakes. On November 23 she was moved up on class for the Grade III Princess Stakes over one mile on a fast dirt track at Delta Downs in which her opponents included the Sorrento Stakes winner Concave and the Matron Stakes winner Miss Behaviour. Ridden by Miguel Mena, she raced in fourth place before producing a sustained run in the straight. She took the lead in the closing stages and won by one and a quarter lengths from Bahnah with a gap of more than five lengths back to Concave in third place. The Blood-Horse's correspondent described the result as a \\"mild surprise\\". =2014: three-year- old season= Tepin made very little impact on her first two starts of 2014, finishing unplaced in the Miss Preakness Stakes on dirt at Pimlico Race Course in May and the Regret Stakes on turf at Churchill Downs in June. Stewart Elliott took over from Mena when the filly contested the Grade II San Clemente Handicap over one mile on turf at Del Mar Racetrack on July 20. Starting as an 18.3/1 longshot, she made steady progress in the straight to finish second, two and a half lengths behind the winner Istanford. On her only other appearance of the season, the filly finished last in the Grade I Del Mar Oaks on August 17. =2015: four-year-old season= In 2015, Julien Leparoux took over as Tepin's regular jockey and rode her in all of her races. She began her third season at Gulfstream Park in March, winning an allowance race over eight and a half furlongs to record her first success in almost sixteen months. She was then moved up in class for the Grade II Churchill Distaff Turf Mile Stakes on May 2 and started the 9.1/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Coffee Clique (Just A Game Stakes), Lady Lara (Honey Fox Stakes) and Sandiva (Suwannee River Stakes). Tepin led from the start and repelled several challenges to win by a length and a half from Coffee Clique, with Sandiva three lengths back in third. Casse explained that the filly had been suited by making the running at a steady pace and Leparoux concurred before adding \\"I really like the filly and was confident today\\". Another step up in grade saw the filly contesting the Grade I Just A Game Stakes at Belmont Park and starting third favorite behind Ball Dancing (Jenny Wiley Stakes) and Coffee Clique. Her other rivals on this occasion included Discreet Marq (2013 Del Mar Oaks), Filimbi (Goldikova Stakes), J Wonder (Fred Darling Stakes), Sandiva and Lady Lara. After tracking the leaders, Leparoux switched Tepin to the outside in the straight. She accelerated past Discreet Marq and held off the late- running Filimbi to win by half a length. After Tepin's first win at the highest level Leparoux commented \\"She's got a big heart. Every time I asked her, she was going and she fought to the end. She kept digging and digging\\". Tepin failed to add to her winning tally in her next two starts but ran well in defeat on both occasions. At Saratoga Race Course on July 25 she was beaten a nose by the Canadian mare Hard Not To Like in the nine furlong Diana Stakes with Stephanie's Kitten in fifth. In the Ballston Spa Handicap at the same track in August, she started favorite and led for most of the way before being caught on the wire and beaten a head by the Chilean import Dacita. Tepin began her autumn campaign at Keeneland on October 2 when she was one of eleven fillies and mares to contest the Grade I First Lady Stakes over one mile on turf. She was favored at 1.7/1 against rivals including My Miss Sophia (2014 Gazelle Stakes) and a strong European contingent comprising Outstanding and Easter from the Irish stable of Aidan O'Brien and Crowley's Law from England. After tracking the outsider Cara Marie, Tepin went to the front a furlong out and accelerated away from the field to win \\"easily\\" by seven lengths from Crowley's Law. After the race Casse said \\"She was fired up today; she went a little wild in the paddock and stepped on my toe. But I told Julien when I put him up, 'She's on her game.' She was impressive. We'll probably go to the Breeders' Cup Mile\\". As Casse had indicated, Tepin's next race was the Breeders' Cup Mile at Keeneland on October 31, a race which had not been won by a North American female racehorse since the ex-English Royal Heroine took the inaugural running in 1984. The race appeared to be dominated by the French entry which comprised Make Believe (the 2.7/1 favorite), Esoterique, Karakontie and Impassable (Prix Daniel Wildenstein), while Britain was represented by Time Test (Tercentenary Stakes, Joel Stakes) and Mondialiste (Woodbine Mile). Tepin at 7/1 was the only North American runner to start at odds of less than 25/1. Tepin broke first out of the gate before racing in second place as the outsider Obviously set a steady pace before accelerating into the lead approaching the final furlong. She quickly went clear of the field and won by two and a half lengths from Mondialiste with the American- trained outsiders Grand Arch and Mshawish taking third and fourth. After the race Casse referenced previous female winners of the race saying, \\"To be in the same company with Goldikova, Miesque, and Royal Heroine, beating the boys in the Mile, I'm not sure I have the words. Am I dreaming? She just continues to amaze me\\". Owner Robert Materson said, \\"I told everyone that she was the best filly in the country and she proved it today\\". =2016: five-year-old season= At the Eclipse Awards in January 2016 Tepin was named American Champion Female Turf Horse after taking 211 of the 261 votes. On February 13, 2016, Tepin made her first appearance since Breeders Cup in the Endeavour Stakes at Tampa Bay Downs and won by three and a half lengths from Lady Lara. A month later at the same track she added a win the Hillsborough Stakes, beating Isabella Sings by a length. She returned to Grade I company on April 16 in the Jenny Wiley Stakes at Keeneland Racecourse and started the 2/5 favourite against eight opponents. After tracking the leaders Leparoux sent Tepin into the lead in the straight and the mare drew away to win by five lengths in a race record time of 1:40.53. In June the mare was sent to England to contest the Group One Queen Anne Stakes over the straight mile course at Royal Ascot. European rule meant that she was not allowed her raceday Lasix medication and was not permitted to be equipped with her usual breathing strip. She faced several of the best European mile performers including Belardo, Esoterique, Toormore, Amazing Maria (Falmouth Stakes) and Ervedya (Prix du Moulin). Starting at odds of 11/2 Tepin raced prominently on the stands side, before taking the lead in the last quarter mile and held off the sustained challenge of Belardo to win by half a length. In doing so, she became the first horse based outside of Europe to take the Queen Anne. \\"We didn‚Äôt expect to win,\\" said Masterson. \\"We took her [overseas] because we thought it was the right thing to do. She‚Äôd done everything she could do in the United States. We actually wanted to show her off in England, because they were kind enough to invite us over there.\\" Tepin at the 2016 Breeders' Cup On returning to North America, Casse considered entering the mare in the Fourstardave at Saratoga in August but was concerned when she had a few \\"blah days\\". Instead, he entered her in the Grade I Woodbine Mile on September 17. Casse wound up missing the race at Woodbine, his home track, as he had been attending the Keeneland Sales and his flight to Toronto was grounded. Off a layoff of nearly three months, Tepin was not at her sharpest but hit the lead in mid-stretch then held off late challenges by Tower of Texas and Mutakayyef to win by half a length. It was her eighth consecutive win, including three Group/Grade 1 wins against males in three different countries. As she approached the winner's circle, the crowd started chanting her name. \\"Even my people at Woodbine said 'We've never had anything like this before, we've never been around this,\\" said Casse, watching the race in Kentucky. \\"I wish I could have been there to hear [the chants]. We're just so proud of her.\\" Tepin next entered the First Lady Stakes at Keeneland on October 8 as the heavy favorite. Photo Call unexpectedly went to the front and opened up a lead of 10 lengths while setting moderate fractions. Tepin unleashed a closing kick down the stretch but fell short by lengths. \\"We hoped for the best, but this is why we picked this race in particular,\\" said Norman Casse. \\"We didn't really want to run her 'A' race today. The goal has always been the Breeders' Cup Mile, a repeat there. I haven't lost any confidence in her, I think we are still set up to do that and she'll move forward from this race.\\" Photo finish of the 2016 Breeders' Cup Mile Although Tepin remained the top ranked turf mare in the United States, some feared she had passed her prime. In the Breeders' Cup Mile, she faced an excellent field led by Limato (July Cup, Prix de la For√™t) and Alice Springs (Falmouth, Matron, Sun Chariot). Behind a rapid early pace, Tepin settled into seventh position on the outside just behind Limato. In front of them was Tourist, who kicked for home first and sailed up the rail to the lead. Four wide around the final turn, Tepin made a late charge but missed by half a length. The time for the race was 1:31.71 ‚Äì the fastest Breeders' Cup Mile ever run and just off the Santa Anita course record of 1:31.69. \\"We had a good race\\", said Leparoux. \\"I was right behind the favorite and was in a good spot. She made a run but the winner got a dream trip on the inside. What else can you say about her? She had an incredible year. We were hoping she would end the year with a win but it's been a pleasure to ride her.\\" \\"You know, Norman came up and said 'Dad, what a hell of a year it's been,'\\" said Casse. \\"I'm just so proud of everybody and I'm so proud of Tepin. She ran a hell of a race and ... as long as she's happy and healthy, she could run some more.\\" Tepin was again named the American Champion Female Turf Horse in the 2016 Eclipse Award balloting. Retirement Tepin was originally scheduled to race in 2017 but experienced a mild bout of colic before her planned debut in the Endeavour Stakes and missed the race. She soon resumed training but uncharacteristically refused to break into a gallop in a scheduled workout on March 27. On April 18, Casse announced that Tepin would be retired. \\"We just think she doesn't want to do it anymore. She's happy and healthy,\\" he said. \\"She just doesn't have the same desire to train and we said all along if she showed that to us we would listen. We've given her the opportunity, we took her to Churchill which definitely made her happy but she still... it's just time.\\" At the 2017 Fasig-Tipton sale, she was sold in foal for $8 million to Coolmore Stud, who announced their plan to breed her to Galileo in future. Tepin produced her first foal, a filly by Curlin, on May 1, 2018.

She is best known for her monumental tapestries designed for architectural settings. Early life and education Hernmark's parents were Carl Hernmarck, curator of decorative arts at the Swedish National Museum of Fine Arts, and Kerstin Simon, a journalist. Her uncle, Swedish modernist architect Sven Markelius, was one of five authors of the modernist manifesto, Acceptera, published in 1931. Hernmarck studied weaving in Stockholm, first at the Swedish Association of Friends of the Textile Arts, and later at Sweden‚Äôs University College of Arts, Crafts and Design. Her primary teacher was Swedish textile artist Edna Martin. She apprenticed with textile designer Alice Lund. Career Hernmarck lived in Canada from 1964‚Äì1972, followed by England 1972‚Äì1975, eventually moving to New York in 1975. Hernmarck married industrial designer Niels Diffrient in 1976. She participated in the Lausanne Biennales of 1965, 1967, and 1969, received a solo exhibition at MoMA in 1973, and a second solo exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1974. In 1973, she received the American Institute of Architects Craftsmanship Medal. Hernmarck began producing monumental tapestries for corporate settings in the late 1960s, eventually working with architects such as Philip Johnson, I.M. Pei and Partners, Skidmore Owings and Merrill (SOM), George Nelson, Ulrich Franzen, Hugh Stubbins, John Carl Warnecke, Kevin Roche, and others. One of her earliest commissions was for the executive offices of the Weyerhaeuser Company in Seattle, Washington (1970‚Äì71) and one of her later commissions was for the Time Warner Center in New York. In 1999, Hernmarck had a major retrospective exhibition at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, \\"Monumental and Intimate,\\" which traveled to Waldemarsudde in Stockholm, Sweden later that year. She participated in the ‚ÄúSourcing the Museum‚Äù exhibition at the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C. in 2012. Her work is held in private, corporate, and museum collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Chicago Institute of Art, and the Minneapolis Institute of Art.  Work  Hernmarck was among the first tapestry artists to use photographs as the basis for her designs, which rely on optical illusions to create photorealistic effects. Her work in the 1960s reflected the influence of pop culture with tapestries such as Newspapers (1968) woven from a composition of newspaper clippings and Little Richard (1969) simulating a 7 by 8 foot album cover. In the 1970s, Hernmarck began working from enlarged color photographs, rendering the effects of light on water in tapestries such as Sailing (1976), which was produced for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Her 1990 Urn, a tromp l'oeil tapestry made for Philip Johnson‚Äôs Peachtree Tower in Atlanta, Georgia, replicates elements of the surrounding architecture. Hernmarck has also used paper collages, watercolors, and photographic details as the basis for her designs. Hernmarck‚Äôs technique differs from traditional gobelin tapestry weaving in that it uses texture, color, and value contrast to establish line, rather than sharp lines and patterns. Before each major commission, Hernmarck works with W√•lstedts mill in Dala-Floda, Sweden to spin and dye yarn. Some of Hernmarck's tapestries are woven, with assistants, at her studio in Connecticut. Others are subcontracted to Alice Lund‚Äôs Textile Studio in Dalarna, Sweden.

He is highly reminiscent of the popular Russian folk hero Ivan the Fool, a flawed young man who always manages to come out on top. *Doono (–ó–Ω–∞–π–∫–∞, from \\"–∑–Ω–∞—é\\", \\"I know\\") - a boy-shorty scientist, the smartest of the boy-shorties, often adopts the leadership role. *Roly-Poly (–ü–æ–Ω—á–∏–∫, or \\"doughnut\\") - a very chubby boy-shorty who likes to eat sweets. *Bendum (–í–∏–Ω—Ç–∏–∫, or \\"little bolt\\") and Twistum (–®–ø—É–Ω—Ç–∏–∫, from \\"little peg\\") - boy- shorty mechanics. *Dr. Pillman (–î–æ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ü–∏–ª—é–ª—å–∫–∏–Ω, from \\"–ø–∏–ª—é–ª—è\\", or \\"pill\\") - a boy-shorty physician. *Glass-Eye (–°—Ç–µ–∫–ª—è—à–∫–∏–Ω, from \\"—Å—Ç–µ–∫–ª—è—à–∫–∞\\", or \\"piece of glass\\") - a boy-shorty astronomer. *Blobs (–¢—é–±–∏–∫, or \\"tube\\") - a boy-shorty painter. *Trills (–ì—É—Å–ª—è, from \\"–≥—É—Å–ª–∏\\", or \\"gusli\\") - a boy-shorty musician. *Posey (–¶–≤–µ—Ç–∏–∫, or \\"bloomer\\") - a boy-shorty poet. *Fuchsia (–§—É–∫—Å–∏—è) and Selyodochka (–°–µ–ª—ë–¥–æ—á–∫–∞, \\"small herring\\") - girl-shorty scientists. *Professor Starman (–ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–æ—Ä –ó–≤—ë–∑–¥–æ—á–∫–∏–Ω) ‚Äî full member of the Academy of Astronomical Sciences, scientific opponent of Doono, then his friend and colleague. *Klyopka (–ö–ª—ë–ø–∫–∞ ‚Äî \\"rivet\\") - a boy-shorty engineer. *Kubik (–ö—É–±–∏–∫, \\"block, brick, little cube\\") - a boy-shorty architect. *Kozlik (–ö–æ–∑–ª–∏–∫ ‚Äî a little goat) ‚Äî a smart unemployed Moon dweller who quickly becomes Dunno's friend after they meet in jail. *Miga (–ú–∏–≥–∞, from ¬´–º–∏–≥¬ª ‚Äî a brief instant, or ¬´–º–∏–≥–∞—Ç—å¬ª ‚Äî ¬´to blink¬ª) ‚Äî a cheater who meets Dunno in jail and with Zhulio's help talks him into founding a ¬´Giant Plants Company¬ª. *Zhulio (–ñ—É–ª–∏–æ, an amalgamated word from –∂—É–ª–∏–∫ ‚Äî a swindler, cheater, and the Portuguese name Julio) ‚Äî a firearms-store owner, Miga's friend. *Spruts (–°–ø—Ä—É—Ç—Å, from —Å–ø—Ä—É—Ç ‚Äî a giant octopus). *Krabs (–ö—Ä–∞–±—Å, from ¬´–∫—Ä–∞–±¬ª ‚Äî ¬´crab¬ª) ‚Äî Sproots' personal assistant. *Skuperfield (–°–∫—É–ø–µ—Ä—Ñ–∏–ª—å–¥, an amalgamated word from —Å–∫—É–ø–µ—Ä–¥—è–π ‚Äî niggard and the English surname Copperfield). *Dubs (–î—É–±—Å, from ¬´–¥—É–±¬ª ‚Äî ¬´oak¬ª, also ¬´dumb man¬ª in Russian). *Other Millionaires. *Kolosok (–ö–æ–ª–æ—Å–æ–∫, ¬´little ear¬ª [for example, of rye]) and other poor peasants who have received seeds from Doono. *Figl (–§–∏–≥–ª—å), Migl (–ú–∏–≥–ª—å), Drigl (–î—Ä–∏–≥–ª—å), Vrigl (–í—Ä–∏–≥–ª—å) and other policemen.  Plot  = Beginning = Even before the events described in the book, Doono with Fuksiya and Selyodochka from Sun City visited the Moon and brought out the moon mineral with extraordinary properties (later called lunit). After a number of events it turns out that its rapprochement with the magnet gives the effect of local weightlessness that can allow to send to the moon a spaceship with large crew and supplies on board. As Doono hopes, there is intelligent life over there, which due to the loss of the atmosphere has moved inside of the Moon. The cosmonauts take the seeds of terrestrial cultivated plants with them. However, the exclusion of Dunno from the flight for stealing the weightlessness device from the Pavilion and careless handling of it, which nearly led to its loss, brings to these plans unexpected adjustments. Dunno instigates Roly-Poly, who was also not included into the crew, to fly as stowaways. The day before the launch they snuck into the rocket. At night before the flight Roly-Poly has changed his mind, but instead of getting out of the rocket accidentally launched it into flight in automatic mode. After the moon landing Dunno and Roly-Poly come out in space suits for a walk to a nearby mountain. In a cave Dunno falls into an icy tunnel leading down to the internal cavity of the moon and slides down, apparently sitting down, thereon in the sublunary space. Going down on a parafoil, he finds on the inner core of the moon (which the locals call the Earth, too) with the civilization of the same shorties, but living according to the laws of capitalism. The size of lunar plants, in contrast to terrestrial, is proportional to the height of the shorties so they appear to be undersized for Dunno. Roly-Poly, after losing Dunno, runs in panic back to the rocket. Being on the moon, Dunno, unfamiliar with the concepts of money (lunar currency ‚Äî \\"ferting\\" (author-derived from British \\"farthing\\") consisting of a hundred of \\"santik\\" (author-derived from French \\"centime\\")) and private property is always getting into unpleasant situations. At first, he appears in the garden of Mr. Klops and eats his raspberries, that's why he was grabbed and hounded by order of Klops as a thief. Dunno, fortunately, managed to escape over the fence, while he did not understand what was, in fact, his fault. Then he was taken to jail for refusing to pay in a street cafe, where during registration through a system of identification using simplified Bertillon method he was mistakenly identified as the famous gangster Pretty Boy (–ö—Ä–∞—Å–∞–≤—á–∏–∫), as a result the police were extorting a bribe, and Dunno's refusal and complete misunderstanding of the situation were regarded as intractability and he was placed into a prison cell. There he met unemployed shorty Kozlik and small crook Miga. Miga believed the story of Dunno about the seeds of giant plants, helped him to avoid a scuffle in the cell, and before the release of Dunno from prison gave him a letter to his friend, arms dealer Zhulio. After leaving the jail Dunno and Kozlik come to Zhulio. He makes a bail for Miga and all four are discussing the prospects for growing terrestrial plants on the Moon, the seeds of which were left in the rocket on the Moon surface. To raise funds for the construction of an aircraft capable to reach the outer Moon surface, they start a joint-stock company called \\"The Society of Giant Plants\\", whose shares are secured by future shares of prospective seeds (i.e., at the beginning of the company's activities it is actually a consumer cooperative). In doing so they promote the fact of Dunno's arrival as an cosmonaut in mass media and using methods of outdoor advertising (it was especially effective in the countryside, whose residents, as a rule, do not buy newspapers). Gradually the shares are selling. Their activities are disturbing the local monopolists, because appearance of giant plants threatens them with devastation. Spruts, their leader, the largest landowner and owner of the textile and sugar factories, takes measures to collapse their company. He bribes Miga and Zhulio, and they run with the cash received for the shares, leaving Dunno and Kozlik to their fate. At the same time fragmentary allusions to the fraudulent nature of the company, launched by the editor of Spruts-owned newspaper, Grizzle, lead to a panic among small shareholders. Remaining unaware about what was happening Dunno and Kozlik are forced to flee, and go to San Komarik. Not finding there Miga and Zhulio, they have found themselves on the dark side of life. They wander, with hunger and disasters in flophouses without any work. Meanwhile, stock traders Zhmurik, Teftel and Hanakonda are buying huge batch of the Society's shares on an upward trend, and are taking steps to rectify the situation of their cheapness by entering an information war in the media against Spruts' newspapers. Skuperfild, the owner of the pasta factory, being in the dark about the backstage war of financial speculators, spent almost all capital buying Society's shares, but Spruts deals a decisive blow: he published the documentary details about the collapse of the company. All shares have depreciated at one moment, and as a result Skuperfild was on the verge of bankruptcy. In desperation, he reduced his workers' pay down to half ‚Äî initially workers threaten to strike, and then have declare it. Then Skuperfild decides to recruit new workers among the inhabitants of flophouses in San Komarik. Among those hired were Dunno and Kozlik. Cars with new employees have arrived in Brehenville. According to the Skuperfild's plan, they should immediately get to work. But striking regular workers becomes aware of this trick. The strikers organize a defense - in cold blood they push newcomers away from Skuperfild's factory and begin to frantically chase them all over the city, as a result unfortunate Dunno and Kozlik are thrown into the river. Dunno lost shoes, Kozlik lost hat. To earn some money, Kozlik takes Dunno's hat and goes to the city, Dunno remains under a bridge. There he soon met a group of other homeless. Kozlik failed to scrape up a santik in a strange city, he came back with nothing. They dined a piece of bread, that one of the tramps (Bubble) gave them and stay with tramps overnight. Police shut down lights on the embankment and arrested whole company in the middle of the night, except Bubble, who was able to take out one of the attackers with his own stun baton and escaped down the river on an inflatable rubber pillow. In the end Dunno and Kozlik sent to The Fools' Island for the sleeping outside and for not having boots and hat. On Fools' Island lunar shorties in course of time turn into rams exposed to harmful air. Roly-Poly, after abandoning Dunno to his fate, is trying to stifle the voice of conscience with continuous absorption of food. Eventually, he ate a year's supply of food in the rocket in four days. Deciding to go in search of food, he returns to the cave, falls inside of the Moon, but as a result of rotation of the \\"inner Moon\\" found himself in another place. Unlike Dunno, Roly-Poly, as a more cautious and practical shorty, quickly learns the essence of commodity-money relations. In addition, he gets lucky from the outset and he opens a new market niche ‚Äî sale of salt. He quickly gets richer, hires workers for the salt production, but soon go bankrupt, unable to compete with owners of large factories, led by Dracula ‚Äî the owner of the coast with raw salt. After the bankruptcy Roly-Poly becomes \\"Twister\\" ‚Äî a worker at an amusement park, actuating rides. After some time he joins the \\"Society of Free Twisters\\" (Trade union analogue). = Expedition from Earth = Doono with friends found disappearance of the rocket with Dunno and Roly-Poly on board, and organize a rescue mission. Having built a new multistage rocket FaH (\\"Fuchsia and Herring\\"), 12 shorties led by Doono go to the moon. Having found big rocket (called \\"DaR\\" ( \\"Dunno and Roly- Poly\\")) empty, they go in search of Dunno and Roly-Poly and discover the icy corridor leading to the inner cavity of the Moon. Having discovered large deposits of lunit and antilunit (Mineral which levels effect of the lunit, with a smaller radius of action than lunit), Doono and his companions go down in a rocket on the ice corridor. However, lunar astronomers employed by Spruts inform him about the arrival of the new rocket. Therefore, while approaching city of Fantomas rocket was fired upon and Doono has been forced down in the countryside. Police raid on earthlings ends in complete failure after the use of weightlessness by Doono. Earthlings have founded the \\"Space City\\", come into contact with the villagers, give them the seeds of giant plants, as well as supplying all of them weightlessness devices and antilunit. Armed with this \\"terrible power\\" ‚Äî weightlessness, they overthrow the capitalists. Roly-Poly came out to another \\"Twisters\\" during all of these events and tell them that he's alien. They sent him on train to Fantomas, from where he reached the \\"Space City\\". Roly-Poly offered to search for Dunno on Fool's island. Earthlings arrived in Los Paganos and seized one of the ships. With the help of the captain Rumbik, familiar to Roly-Poly, characters get to the Fool's island and rescued Dunno and Kozlik, who already begun to turn into a ram, and other doomed shorties. Dunno offers to bury weightlessness device in the middle of Fool's island so harmful air, converting shorties to rams, went up and the fresh sea air would start come to the island. But it didn't come to that. (You never know where it will go with the wind). Characters come back with Dunno and Kozlik to the \\"Space City\\". Dunno feels bad. Dr. Pillman diagnosed him with an acute nostalgia and noted the need for urgent return to Earth. Despite the sabotage of Spruts and Zhulio, who blew up the FaH rocket, earthlings fly away using propellers at spacesuits and the device of weightlessness. On the surface of the Moon, they boarded the DaR rocket and made their way back to Earth. Once home, Dunno immediately healed, and declared that \\"now we can go somewhere on a journey again.\\"  Lunar capitalism  The novel was written as a satire on Western capitalism of that time. Some things are too exaggerated, some things, on the contrary, remained to this day. According to the writer's grandson, Igor Nosov, Dunno on the Moon was ahead of the time, becoming a factual description of post-Soviet Russia, describing its inherent \\"wild capitalism\\". The following are the main features of the Lunar Society: * Splicing of the oligarchy and the government. In fact, the political power in the novel is not shown, and the police directly obey orders of monopolists. It is even said that \\"The Rich hide behind laws they made up\\". * Persecution of trade unions and workers' organizations. * Great role of fictitious capital (see exchange trading of shares of companies, including already non-existent). * Almost complete monopolization of the business ‚Äî mainly in the form of syndicates (see the description of the operation of \\"bredlams\\"). * Certain features peculiar to pre-capitalist formations (monetary sharecropping in the extraction of salt on the coast belonging to the landlord Dracula). * Fighting both economic (dumping ‚Äî see the resolution of the \\"Salt bredlam\\" in regard to small producers of salt) and non-economic methods including criminal. (Forced upon false-bankruptcy of \\"The Society of Giant Plants\\"; Dubs proposal to hire assassins to \\"remove\\" Zhulio and Miga; gasoline traders' suit against tire manufacturer Poodle after a stop in Davilon all traffic due to the cutting of tires on all cars after the letter saying that the alleged bank robbery money are hidden away in car tires). * Significant unemployment, including congestive. * Widespread presence of the day labor. * An extensive network of primitive uncomfortable flophouses (\\"Dead End\\" type of hotels) in all cities. * Providing of budgetary services on a \\"payment on the fact\\" scheme (\\"Economical\\" hotel). * Draconian legislation against vagrancy and pauperism: anyone who spends the night on the street or walks without shoes or a hat becomes a target for the police and should be sent to the Fools' Island. * Great susceptibility of the population to advertising (see gingerbread ads of the \\"Dawn\\" candy factory, whose poster Dunno, the space traveler, was holding, these gingerbread originated excess demand and shops managed to sell even the stale goods; everyone's desire to be treated only at Dr. Injector, after he had personally examined Dunno, the guest from another planet, in front of the TV viewers) * Product placement of Spruts' products, such as foods, in newspapers owned by Spruts (particularly in the \\"Davilon Humoresques\\"). * Unfair advertising (e.g. \\"hidden fees\\" in the \\"Economical\\" hotel). * Crowd manipulation through the mass media (see campaign against the existence of the seeds of the giant plants, dependence of stock prices on what is written in newspapers, advertising and anti-advertising). * Kickbacks ‚Äî when Spruts invites members of the \\"Big Bredlam\\" to chip in together on 3 million to bribe Miga and Zhulio. Spruts collected from the monopolists 3 million and left to himself 1 million (initially intending to leave 2 million). * Conspicuous consumption of both rich and poor (see description of the lifestyle of a soap factory owner Gryazing; purchase of a car on a loan by Kozlik); rich people are not engaged in capital increase, but in irrational squandering the money, breaking furniture for their own entertainment or doing other meaningless waste of money (dog restaurants, hair salons, etc.). * Primitive cinema, television and painting. Abstract scribble masquerading as art. Movies are exclusively about violent clashes between police and criminalsm, mass brawls, deafening firefights, dizzying pursuits (in short only thrills and no benefit either for the mind or soul). This was even more distinctive on the Fool's island, where movies in cinema were said to be even more primitive than elsewhere. * Undemanding, immoral and often violent public entertainment (see \\"Funny Puppet Show\\"). * Censorship of the media. * Neglect of fundamental scientific research that does not produce direct benefits. * Extensive corruption of both police and judiciary, bribery and impunity for the rich (see extortion of bribe from Dunno by Migl, recognition of total bribe of police by judge Vrigl, \\"Mutual Aid Society\\", undivided executive and judicial powers). * Free arms trading, including auto firearms and even artillery (a machine gun and a cannon in the warehouse of the \\"Store of different-sized goods\\"), as well as free trade of police and gangster armor: police uniforms, batons, lock picks, masks, crowbars, knives for hacking safes and so on. * The interest of the police is only in the fight against gangsters, but not in the elimination of gangsterism (\\"if there are no bandits, the police become unnecessary and policemen will be without a job\\"). This explains the existence of free arms trade and why the police turns a blind eye to that. * Countering to strikebreaking by supporters of the Workers' self-management in the Skuperfield's factory. * Introduction of elements of the state of emergency with the appearance of a threat to the ruling regime. *Police brutality - The policemen were portrayed as feared and brutal men who always dealt with others in threatening or violent manner and had no issue with excessively using their stun batons. When \\"bald headed\\" shorty accused them of stealing a large sum of money in a bank robbery, they resorted to mass arrests of bald headed shorties. They were also willing to immediately use lethal force on Donno and other members of Lunar Expedition, when they refused to leave. The police also handed out corporal punishments (beating and electrical shocks) for minor crimes, as many criminals, including Dunno, were thought to let themselves be jailed on purpose to get access to free food, shelter and hygiene. In the satirical purpose the names of the rich and their minions and most of the names of lunar cities are derived from words with a negative shade (Grabenberg - \\"Stealberg\\", Brehenville - \\"Liarville\\", the cities Los Svinos - from \\"svinya\\" (pig, swine), Los Paganos - from \\"poganyi\\" (filthy); Spruts (from \\"sprut\\" - giant octopus), Gryazing (\\"gryaz'\\" - dirt), Dryaning (\\"dryan'\\" - trash), Skuperfield (\\"skuperdyai\\" - niggard), judge Vrigl (\\"vrat'\\" - tell lies) etc.). The novel also used the names of famous villains (Dracula the salt magnate, Fantomas city). Additionally, common Jewish last name suffixes such as, ‚Äú-field‚Äù, and ‚Äú-berg‚Äù were used in the names of some Lunar characters to symbolize and reference popular anti- Semitic conspiracies about Jews who were involved in capitalist and monopolist financial activities through the early to late 1960‚Äôs. In the 1997 Dunno cartoon, Lunar characters who had Jewish last name suffixes were drawn with negative stereotypical references (large curved noses, black/dark hair, dishonest and greedy poses, and Mediterranean appearances). The attitude of Nosov to the idea of capitalism is controversial. Despite a satirical tone of the novel and a frank ridiculing of Western capitalist orders of that time, at the end of the story Nosov indirectly hints that \\"good\\" capitalism still has a right to exist. After overthrowing the power of the monopolists and taking control of both the economy and society as a whole in their hands, the moon workers and peasants did not radically change the economic system: commodity- money relations (and the market in general) of the inhabitants of intralunar civilization has remained. This differs Nosov from the most of writers- propagandists of the Soviet era, who had not seen in their works about the social and revolutionary achievements no other way but to build communism. The fate of smaller businesses (such as restaurants or shops) was not disclosed in the book, it was only said that the rich had their property (factories and money) confiscated. It was said that the new order immensely helped small businesses, especially restaurants, as almost everyone could now afford going there for a meal instead of cooking themselves. So, presumably, their owners \\"survived\\" the purge. But the assertion that Nosov in his book allegedly defends \\"good capitalism\\", denying communism, is wrong. As Nosov clearly states: \\"Television then often showed the workers who now independently, without the masters ran their factories and plants.\\" This means that on the Moon, it was precisely communism, portrayed by a classless society where the exploiting classes were expropriated, and where there is no place for private ownership of production.

It premiered on November 7 at the Plymouth Theatre and ran until December 19.  Plot  Judith Traherne is a Long Island socialite whose life is spent in frivolous, hedonistic pastimes. She indulges in alcohol and cigarettes, and enjoys horse riding. She experiences dizziness and headaches, and after an uncharacteristic riding accident, she is referred to a specialist, Dr. Frederick Steele. Steele is in the midst of closing his New York City office in preparation of a move to Brattleboro, Vermont, where he plans to devote his time to brain cell research. He reluctantly agrees to see Judith, who is initially antagonistic towards him. She shows signs of short-term memory loss, but dismisses these and other symptoms. Steele convinces her the ailments she is experiencing are serious and potentially life-threatening, and puts his career plans on hold to tend to her. Steele finds that she has an inoperable brain tumor, and predicts she has only a year to live. Shortly after becoming blind, she will die. Judith falls in love with the idealistic doctor, and they enjoy a brief respite in the Vermont countryside before she faces imminent death. She comes to the realization that their relationship has brought meaning to the life she had been leading.  Cast  * Tallulah Bankhead as Judith Traherne * Earle Larimore as Dr. Frederick Steele * Ann Andrews as Alden Blaine * Lewis Dayton as Postman * Dwight Fiske as Leslie Clarke * Myra Hampton as Josie * Frederick Leister as Dr. Parsons * Edgar Norfolk as Michael * Helen Strickland as Miss Jenny * Mildred Wall as Miss Wainwright  Production  The property, described by Robert Benchley as \\"Camille without all the coughing\\" (the Lady of the Camellias has a long and agonizing death scene which was made famous by Sarah Bernhardt famously pathos-inspiring rendition of it, complete with coughing), had been floating around the entertainment capitals of both American coasts, and deficiencies in the script were acknowledged. Tallulah had read it and rejected it while she was still in Hollywood on her contract with Paramount Pictures. Katharine Hepburn had agreed to try it out in summer stock before changing her mind. When the script reached Bankhead again, Jock Whitney, wealthy industrialist and her sometimes-lover, assured her that the play's deficiencies were corrected as Maxwell Anderson had revised it. Tallulah was adept at glossing over the holes in a script and was determined to make a success of it for Whitney. Robert Edmond Jones, who had designed the settings for John Barrymore‚Äôs Richard III and Hamlet a decade earlier, did the set craft, and Tallulah's costumes were by Elsa Schiaparelli. Robert Milton directed the production. David O. Selznick was considering filming Dark Victory with Greta Garbo, but Tallulah was uninterested in serving as a dry run for another actress. She got a contract stipulation that if she did not play Judith Traherne on screen she would receive a percentage of the film sale. After 51 performances, on December 20, 1934, it was the first sold-out performance since the opening night. But Tallulah awoke to find that she had lost her voice. Estelle Winwood, who‚Äôd spent the night at Tallulah's, called for a doctor. He instructed Tallulah to proceed to the theater and that he would meet her there, but by the time Tallulah reached the theater, her face was swelling rapidly. She was sent home and the matinee was canceled. Bankhead had contracted an infection that was then (before the advent of antibiotics) potentially deadly. Without Tallulah, Whitney was not interested in prolonging the run of Dark Victory, and it closed immediately.  Reception  The play was generally received well critically, and Bankhead's acting was praised. However, the play was commercially unsuccessful. Robert Garland in the Telegram, reviewing the play, wrote that Bankhead had acted with ‚Äúunflagging skill.‚Äù In the Sun, Richard Lockridge wrote: ‚ÄúMiss Bankhead gives an altogether admirable performance for the first sane act and a half. At odd moments even in the later difficult moments she brings into her playing a note of tense feeling which cuts through the theatricalism.‚Äù Percy Hammond of the Herald Tribune wrote of the scene where Judith, at her nadir, considers giving herself to the groom at her estate stables. ‚ÄúMiss Bankhead was gorgeously tempting and tempted, and for a moment or two many of us feared that she would request him to visit her in the middle of the night.‚Äù Regarding the lukewarm commercial reception, Variety speculated that Dark Victory was the right play at the wrong time (ie, the Great Depression. Public audiences greatly preferred comedy, fantasy, and other escapist or light-hearted productions, over tragedies). ‚ÄúTragedy has a place in the theatre, but it seems so much vexation has plagued the people that they prefer to be amused instead of going through an ordeal.‚Äù The paper‚Äôs ‚ÄúIbee.‚Äù reported that several spectators in the first-night audience had passed out in response to the intensely realistic medical examination Tallulah received in the opening scene.  Adaptations  Bette Davis starred in a 1939 film version with a vastly improved script, for which she received an Academy award nomination. She had seen a performance of the play, and later admitted to emulating Bankhead in the role. Barbara Stanwyck and Melvyn Douglas starred in a 1938 adaptation of the play presented on Lux Radio Theatre, and in 1940 Davis and Spencer Tracy appeared in another radio version. On March 6, 1952, CBS Radio's Hollywood Sound Stage aired a condensed 30-minute version starring Stanwyck and David Brian,Goldin, J. David. \\"Hollywood Sound Stage.\\" radiogoldindex.com, 2012. Retrieved: August 20, 2012. In 1953, the film was remade under its original title for a TV adaptation for the Broadway Television Theatre, starring Sylvia Sidney, Christopher Plummer, and Ian Keith. In 1963, the film was remade as Stolen Hours with Susan Hayward and Michael Craig, directed by Daniel Petrie. The time frame was updated and the locale changed to England. In 1976, it was remade under its original title as an NBC television movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery as television producer Katherine Merrill under the care of Dr. Michael Grant, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins; this version was directed by Robert Butler.

Opened in 1886, the 10-kilometer long trail was the first scenic route to be completed in the Royal National Park, seven years after the park was officially declared. It initially served as a carriageway, although traffic on the road is closed, and the trail now serves as a bike and walking trail. The route bypasses many scenic points along the Hacking River, including Gibraltar Rock and Palona Cave. History Historic photograph of a park ranger riding on horseback on lady Carrington Drive. Originally named Lady Carrington Road, the trail took three years to build, starting in 1880 and completed in 1883, although it would not be opened to traffic until another three years later, in 1886. It was the first scenic route to be built through the Royal National Park, which was officially proclaimed by acting Premier of New South Wales John Robertson only the year earlier. The route was first used as a carriageway from Audley through to the southern precinct of the park, east of Waterfall, described as a \\"pleasure drive, through beautiful sylvan scenery\\". The trail is named after the wife of former Governor of New South Wales, Lord Charles Carrington, Lady Cecilia Carrington. Held in high esteem by the public at the time, the Carringtons were noted for their generosity, and resulting popularity and appeal. Lady Carrington herself was noted for her charitable works, including having established of a Jubilee Fund to relieve distressed women. Lady Carrington Drive is one of many places named in honour of the Carringtons, most notable of which are the Carrington Hotel in Katoomba and the Carrington Falls in the Budderoo National Park. Lady Carrington herself opened the road in 1886, a year after her husband was appointed Governor of New South Wales. While the road was cited as the source of the Royal National Park's initial popularity, the road saw waning traffic as the popularity was shifted towards the coastal regions of the park, and was later closed to traffic. The road now serves as a bike and walking track. Route Map of Lady Carrington Drive, highlighted in red, and surrounds. (Click to enlarge) Lady Carrington Drive starts out at Audley at its north end, where it splits off from Sir Bertram Stevens Drive, just south of Audley Weir. The near entirety of the route is situated on the eastern bank of the Hacking River, the longest river in the Royal National Park. Traffic from Sir Bertram Stevens Drive is allowed up to 200m into the route, with the Royal National Park Visitor Centre situated at the very start of Lady Carrington Drive, and vehicle access into the Willow Tree Flat and Fig Tree Flat picnic grounds. Past Fig Tree Flat, the road is closed off to traffic, and continues as a bike and foot-only track. The trail notably passes over many brooks, with resulted in a large number of small bridges being built for the trail. The brooks are named after the traditional names of birds; the list of brooks from north to south are as follows; Mullion (Eagle), Wurrul (Bee Eater), Burowa (Bustard), Karonga (White Crane), Gorra Worra (Laughing Jackass), Buralga (Native Companion), Kobardo (Parrot), Birumba (Plover), Dirijiri (Wagtail), Murrindum (Quail), Dumbal (Crow), Tamur (Bronze winged Pigeon), Burunda (Swan), Karani (Duck) and Palona (Hawk). The first section of the trail follows a long series of sandstone faces up until a formation known as Gibraltar Rock, which overhangs an old cobblestone section of the trail. The formation is named after the Rock of Gibraltar. Jersey Spring can be found into the trail; the spring feeds into two sandstone watering troughs, built in 1892 to provide water for horses and people traveling along Lady Carrington Road. The troughs, to this day, are still fed by the same spring. The spring is named after Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, the then-Governor of New South Wales. Immediately after, the first of four rest areas along the trail can be found, named the Jersey Spring Clearing; it is an open grass field. into the trail, the Calala rest area can be found, which features a picnic table and a small trail leading to the banks of the Hacking, where minor beaches can be found. Between Calala and the Palona Brook Picnic Area, found into the trail, a plaque dedicated to the memory of Alan Rendell, who died fighting bushfires in 1988, can be found. A kilometre-long offshoot of the track from the Palona Brook Picnic Area leads to the Palona Cave, a large limestone overhang featuring columns, stalactites and even green moss; not reminiscent of most other pristine white limestone caves. in, the last of the four rest points, the Bola Picnic Area, can be found at the intersection of Lady Carrington Drive and the Forest Track, which is a short, circuit track that runs through a dense rainforest section of the park.

The association defines itself as a \\"Traditionalist Catholic lobby group\\". The group was once associated with the Society of St. Pius X but its evolved under the new leadership of Alain Escada and the \\"chaplaincy\\" is now provided by Capuchin Friars of Morgon.  History  Civitas was formed in 1999. It, and ICHTUS, were split out from the integrist Cit√© catholique movement. founded by the pro-Vichy intellectual Jean Ousset. Its media prominence dates from the appointment of its current president, Alain Escada, a Belgian militant of the extreme right with a background of Traditionalist Catholicism and Belgian nationalism, and an ex- member of the New Belgian Front (, FNB), of which he was expelled in 1997. Escada became the secretary-general of Civitas in 2009. In 2012, he replaced Fran√ßois de Penfentenyo as president of Civitas. At the start of 2013, Civitas claims members and \\"sympathisers\\" on its mailing list. Civitas had ambitions of winning 300 seats in the French municipal elections of 2014. In 2016, Civitas announced a status change, from a cultural organization to a French political party. It is a major part of the Coalition pour la Vie et la Famille, a tiny European party.  Aims  Civitas promotes the rechristianisation of France and Europe. It defines itself as a social and political movement in the \\"Traditionalist Catholic lobby\\", a \\"movement whose cause is the restoration to society of the kingship of Our Lord Jesus Christ\\". It is not interested in taking part in abstract political theory, but instead teaches \\"techniques...useful in discussions on the subversive dialectic, learning fundamental skills for effective action: speaking in public meetings, launching associations, concrete action, etc.\\" For historian √âtienne Fouilloux, this militant association, in promoting the establishment of the restoration of the Kingdom of Christ on Earth, is against republicanism and thus the French Republic itself:  Activism  = Opposition to theatrical performances = Civitas came to public attention in 2011, in Paris, when it demonstrated for several consecutive evenings in opposition to the performance of some plays, notably Romeo Castellucci's (original , \\"On the concept of the Son of God's face\\") at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville ‚Äî one performance was interrupted by militants who climbed on stage and threw eggs and waste oil over the audience ‚Äî but also against the Th√©√¢tre du Rond-Point who were performing Rodrigo Garcia's Golgota Picnic, which they judged blasphemous. Civitas denounced what it called \\"Christianophobia\\" and organised another, larger demonstration on 29 October 2011, while Cardinal Andr√© Vingt-Trois, the president of the Bishops' Conference of France, restated that the demonstrators (\\"Had no mandate to defend the Church\\").  Arrests and fines  34 people were arrested for having disturbed the play Sur le concept du visage du fils de Dieu at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville in Paris in October 2011. 32 were arrested and in June 2013 appeared before a Paris tribunal for \\"obstructing freedom of expression\\", which carries a fine of up to ‚Ç¨5,000. Two defendants were found not guilty, three found guilty with fines of ‚Ç¨1,500, ‚Ç¨1,800 and ‚Ç¨2,000, the others fined between ‚Ç¨600 and ‚Ç¨800. = Opposition to same-sex marriage = Non √† l'homofolie (\\"No to gay madness\\") demonstration, 18 November 2012. In June 2012, Civitas released a tract with the slogan (\\"Would you trust your children with these men?\\"). On the photo, of a gay pride parade, one can see two naked men. In November 2012, Civitas organised a march from the Ministry of the Family to the Assembl√©e Nationale, demonstrating against the policy of \\"Marriage for all\\"; according to police sources, nearly 8,000 people marched against \\"\\" (\\"gay madness\\"). On 13 January 2013, the association La Manif pour tous ‚Äî organised to protest the proposed law allowing same-sex marriage, but which excluded Civitas ‚Äî called for a national demonstration against the proposed law. Civitas militants, who had opposed the \\"Barjot concept\\", gathered to leave from the Place Pinel. They protested against same-sex marriage with the motto \\"Catholics for the Family\\". The organisers claimed attendance of , but police sources claimed around , while reports differed across the media, such as in Le Monde and Le Nouvel Observateur. L'Express said there were \\"several thousand demonstrators\\". = Opposition to \\"gender theory\\" = At the end of January 2014, Civitas backed Farida Belghoul, who had initiated (\\"stay away from school days\\") in protest against the supposed teaching of what she called \\"gender theory\\" (, more often called Gender studies) in public establishments. In this context, Civitas was criticised for a photo series on its website showing a sex education teacher in compromising sexual positions. Accused by the Press and his opponents of spreading false rumours (the photo came from Canada), Civitas justified their actions by saying they did not have the means to authenticate its origins and it was not out of character for their chosen subject. In response, Le Monde published an article demonstrating that it was trivial and quick to authenticate the origin of the images. A new row developed some days later, when Civitas called for harassment of the TV network Arte to prevent broadcast of the critically acclaimed film Tomboy, which Civitas called \\"gender theory propaganda\\" (). Civitas stated that (\\"This film does not fulfill Arte's mission as the 'inventor, maker and broadcaster of television programmes of a cultural nature'\\"). Civitas advocated protesting (\\"Politely, but firmly, by telephone, fax or post\\").  Controversies  Civitas at the 13 January demonstration at the Place Pinel. Civitas' actions against the Romeo Castellucci play was deprecated by diverse groups including the Mayor of Paris and senior Catholic dignitaries. Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a Government spokesmen, said that Civitas' slogan (\\"No to gay madness\\"), used at the November 2012 demonstration, was \\"misplaced\\". Other incidents occurred on the margins of the event. Some members of the feminist group FEMEN, topless and wearing a parody of a nun's habit, used powder fire extinguishers to spray demonstrators including, according to the organisers, children.. Journalist Caroline Fourest, an AFP photographer and FEMEN were attacked and some were beaten. The police made five arrests. After these incidents, six socialist (elected politicians) demanded the break-up of Civitas. According to the historian Galia Ackerman, it is part of Civitas' order of service to attack Femen. According to the writer Ren√© Guitton: But according to Civitas, the demonstration was a \\"victim\\" of militant feminists. Siding with Civitas, Jacques Bompard, deputy mayor of Orange, denounced the feminists who, according to him, were responsible for the outbursts. Civitas said they had filed a complaint for exhibitionism. Caroline Fourest, one of those involved in the violence, also filed a complaint. Publications Civitas publishes a quarterly review entitled (\\"Civitas ‚Äì Catholic review of political and social questions\\"). It publishes news about the movement, and analyses the major political themes of the day.

He belonged to a family originally from Lorraine, the Vesques de Puttelange (a town on the French border with Luxembourg). He was the father of the diplomat Johann Vesque von P√ºttlingen, who composed operas and songs under the pseudonym 'J. van Hoven'. Life He was born in Brussels, Austrian Netherlands, where his father - also named Jean VesqueHe died in Stadtbr√©dimus, Luxembourg, 23 October 1784. \\\\- was Inspector- General of the estates of the Bishop of Metz, and from 1760 Inspector of Imperial Lotteries, a post in the government of the Austrian Netherlands. His French mother, C√©cilie de Roquilly, came from Commercy in the d√©partment of Meuse. He went to school in his mother's home town of Commercy, and then attended the faculties of philosophy and law at University of Louvain. In 1787, he was given a post in the government service in Brussels where he was on the commission charged with reform of ecclesiastical affairs. Surrender of Brussels, December 1790 On the outbreak of the Brabant Revolution in October 1789 (which occurred simultaneously with the French Revolution and the Li√®ge Revolution, the whole Austrian administration sought safety in Luxembourg; because of a lack of horses, Vesque couldn't go, and stayed in :fr:Treurenberg in Brussels for two months. Brabant formed the nucleus of the unrecognised United Belgian States. Vesque eventually arrived in Trier, where the rest of the government in exile had gathered along with Philipp von Cobenzl. An Austrian army defeated the Belgian revolutionaries in December 1790; in the Revolution's aftermath a convention was held at The Hague on 10 December 1790 to decide how to re-establish Austrian rule, at which Vesque was a negotiator. The Li√®ge Revolution was also finally suppressed by Austrian forces in January 1791. His novel Le Roi Guiot was published in 1791. On 17 March 1793 Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen became Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and Vesque returned to Brussels where - among other functions, he acted as censor of theatres. Battle of Fleurus, with French observation balloon at top right The peace only lasted a few months before the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition, which was an attempt by the Triple Alliance (Prussia, Austria and Britain) to defeat Revolutionary France. France invaded the Low Countries in 1794. The Austrian administration fled for the second time, and during the evacuation of Brussels Vesque was in charge of the government archives, taking them down the River Rhine through Holland to D√ºsseldorf; thence he went to Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle), and continued to Dillenburg in the Duchy of Nassau, where his time of service (since 1787) with the Austrian administration came to an end on 31 December 1794. It appears that he was relatively destitute; he had no belongings since everything was in Brussels. An Austrian Army was defeated in 1795 at the Battle of Fleurus; France formally annexed the Low Countries, and brought in a government in a typically new French style based on merit rather than parentage (the French period). Exiled √©migr√© Peace of Basel & Campo Formio With the Austrian government in Belgium dissolved, Vesque hoped to get to Vienna. However, an Imperial decree made it illegal for government officials from the former Austrian territories to stay or settle in Vienna; and he fell ill on the way and stayed for some time in Frankfurt. With no home to go to, and with dwindling finances, Vesque set off through Germany and Switzerland (mostly on foot), relying on a small pension; he stayed some time in Italy (perhaps including Milan) studying fine art treasures ('Kunstsch√§tze'). At the end of 1799 he was in Lower Austria in Korneuburg, just outside Vienna, but he pleaded in vain to obtain permission to stay in the capital. He travelled on to Bohemia where his fianc√©e, Therese Leenher von Sleeuw, was staying in Prague with her dispossessed family; they were finally married in Prague in 1801. He travelled into Moravia, Schleswig, and finally to West Galicia, which had recently come under Habsburg control in 1795 in the Third Partition of Poland. Tutor to Polish nobility Lubomirski Palace in Opole Lubelskie, designed c.1770 by i.a. Domenico Merlini Around 1800/1801 Vesque was employed by Prince Alexander Lubomirski as tutor for his daughter Princess Rosalia Alexandra Lubomirska in ≈Åa≈Ñcut Castle, ≈Åa≈Ñcut, and then as librarian at the Lubomirski Palace in Opole Lubelskie, West Galicia (now Lublin Voivodship, Poland). The women's quarter in the Conciergerie prisons, Paris, where the seven year-old princess Rosalia Alexandra Lubomirska was held in 1794. Alexander's daughter, named Rozalia (Rosalie) like her mother (the adventurous Rozalia Lubomirska), had an interesting childhood. The seven year- old Rosalie had been incarcerated in Paris during the Reign of Terror with her mother, whose house was frequented by British spies and Girondist counter- revolutionaries.Rozalia Lubomirska had left her husband Prince Alexander for a lover in France, and came back to Poland during the republican-inspired Constitution of May 3, 1791. Alexander Lubomirski may have possibly invited the Russians in, as a member of the Targowica Confederation of conservative magnates; their aims were just to restore the previous status quo. However, the 'liberating' Russians never went away, instead instigating the Second Partition of Poland. The Ko≈õciuszko Uprising followed, in which Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski was heavily involved with the republicans; his palace in Pulawy was burned by Russian troops after they quelled the uprising. During the Third Partition of Poland Russia, Prussia and Habsburg Austria permanently divided the country; it didn't resurface as a nation state until 1917. Her mother was arrested several times, held in the Conciergerie prisons, and guillotined in June 1794. The half-starved child was almost lost: her father Prince Alexander, who was in the French Army, heard of her plight, and sent someone to fetch her, who arrived only three days before she was to have been sent to the Foundling Hospital of Paris, the :fr:H√¥pital Saint-Vincent-de- Paul. She was released after the Thermidorian Reaction (27 July 1794) and the death of Maximilien Robespierre, and later returned to Poland with her father. The War of the Second Coalition was still being waged, and after the Battle of Marengo and Battle of Hohenlinden - both defeats for Austria in 1800 - the Treaty of Lun√©ville was signed in February 1801, in which France expanded into the Southern Netherlands and Luxembourg. The French Republic called for a vote from the inhabitants of the former states if they wanted to become French citizens and remain in a Franco-Belgian state, or whether to be exiled as foreigners and be dispossessed. Vesque told the resident French Minister in Vienna, citoyen Champagny,\\"Le Citoyen francais: journal politique, commercial, litt√©raire, etc.\\", No. 654, 14 Fructidor, Year IX (31 July 1802), p. 3. that he wished to be Austrian as one of those ¬´ individus belges qui ont d√©clar√© vouloir rester sujets autrichiens ¬ª ('Belgian individuals who have declared that they wished to remain Austrian'); he was considered an √©migr√© and his estates and property in Lorraine, in the d√©partement des For√™ts in Luxembourg, and in Belgium were sequestrated, although he still couldn't get a job in Vienna because on the ban on Austrian-Belgian officials/civil servants. Vesque's firstborn son, Johann Vesque von P√ºttlingen was born in the Lubomirski Palace in 1803, and was held by Princess Rosalia at his baptism. Career in Vienna When in 1804 the ban was lifted which had denied the Belgian officials from staying in Vienna, the Lubomirskis, father and daughter, and Vesque moved there straight away. Rosalie Lubomirski married Count Wac≈Çaw Seweryn Rzewuski in Vienna that year, and Vesque soon received a court appointment as Royal Secretary ('K.K. Hofsecret√§r'), and Kanzleidirector of the Oberstk√§mmereramtes. In the job he acquired the full confidence of Oberstk√§mmerer Director Count Rudolf Wrbna.BLK√ñ Wrbna-Freudenthal, Rudolph Graf (in German). Retrieved 2 November 2015.

He had an equally erudite fecund activity which led him to publish a number of works of literary merit, including poetry, fine art, and archaeology. His portrait was painted by Peter Fendi in 1822.

She undertook pioneering investigative work for the Danish State Railways in the late 1920s in connection with the construction of the Little Belt Bridge (completed in 1929) and was the first to propose what later became the Danish Geotechnical Institute. Biography Mertz was born on the Engestofte estate on the island of Lolland where her father, Ludvig Olsen (1861‚Äì1928), was the estate manager. In her late teens, she served an apprenticeship on a farm in the north of Jutland, but in fact she aspired to become an engineer. In 1916, she entered the Polytechnic School in Copenhagen, completing the first stage of her civil engineering course in 1919. As she had spent some time undertaking laboratory work for Geological Survey of Denmark (Danmarks Geologiske Unders√∏gelse: DGU), Victor Madsen, the director, advised her to study geology. As a result, although she did not complete a recognized course of study, she was able to participate constructively in the development of engineering geology. While on a study trip to Stockholm in 1921, Mertz became acquainted with the field of geotechnical investigation, a completely new concept for Denmark. Its development had resulted from collaboration between engineers and geologists after a Swedish dam had collapsed in 1914. Together, the experts were able to come up with proposals for preventing such disasters in the future. Although their final report was not published until 1922, Mertz was able to benefit from their work. On her return to Denmark, she promoted collaboration between the Danish State Railways and the Geological Survey. As a result, in the late 1920s she was charged to undertake a geological study as a basis for the construction of the Little Belt Bridge. In 1930, the Geological Survey and the Danish Railways established a geotechnical laboratory in which Mertz and a railway engineer collaborated, especially on bridge building investigations. From the start, Mertz participated in feasibility studies on a total of eight bridges, all of which were completed in the 1930s. Her initiatives led to the creation of the Geotechnical Survey of Denmark in 1943. It was located in the Danish Railways' administrative building in Copenhagen and was established under the authority of the Academy of Technical Sciences. She continued to work in her geotechnical laboratory until 1969 while maintaining close contacts with the Geotechnical Survey and its staff. In 1958, she was appointed departmental geologist at the Geotechnical Survey. Collaboration between geologists and engineers led to the creation of a new branch of science, engineering geology. Mertz, a pioneer in the field, became known in Scandinavia as the \\"Mother of Engineering Geology\\". She promoted the new field through lectures and courses at the Technical High School and similar institutions. Awards For her contributions to geology, Mertz received the following awards: *1966: Knight of the Order of the Elephant *1974: the Technical University's gold medal Selected publications Among her publications, Mertz compiled a series of nine studies on the geological conditions of the towns of Denmark beginning with Helsing√∏r in 1969 and culminating with Kors√∏r in 1985.  * References Literature * Category:1896 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Danish women scientists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:Danish geologists Category:Danish women geologists Category:20th-century Danish scientists Category:20th-century geologists ","title":"Ellen Louise Mertz"},{"id":"48450859","text":"Columbus is a 2015 Telugu romantic comedy film with lead roles starring Sumanth Ashwin, Seerat Kapoor, and Mishti Chakraborty. The film, produced by Ashwani Kumar Sahdev with music composed by Jithin Roshan, was released on 22 October 2015.It was dubbed into Hindi as Solo Operation by Wam India pvt. ltd.  Plot  Ashwin (Sumanth Ashwin) is a college student who falls for Indu (Mishti Chakraborty). His love for her becomes so distracting that he ignores his former career goals to concentrate on her. His zeal begins to annoy her. She irritably ignores him and goes to Delhi. Heartbroken, he follows her and becomes involved in a murder mystery and is unfortunately arrested. When released from jail he finds that she has left for good. He crosses paths with Neeraja (Seerat Kapoor) who promises to help him track her down.

Reception  The film's plus points are that the growing romance between Sumanth Ashwin's and Seerat Kapoor's characters are interesting and their chemistry is \\"handled pretty well\\". It is further noted that the acting skills of Sumanth Ashwin have \\"improved by leaps and bounds\\" when compared to his earlier film works. His delivery was decent and he did well with his comedy. It was further felt that \\"Seerat Kapoor is quite impressive and has done her best\\". It was also offered that Misthi performed her part well but pretty much \\"has nothing much to do\\". It was felt that the film's second half with its revealing of major plot twists were the film's greatest asset. However, it was felt that despite the pluses, a drawback was found in \\"the weak characterization of the lead actors\\", and the fact \\"some very important characters have been misused in the film\\", and that \\"Saptagiri‚Äôs comedy looks out of place and does not create much laughter.\\" It was summarized \\"On the whole, Columbus is yet another triangular love story which has its moments. Seerat Kapoor‚Äôs romantic track with Sumanth Ashwin and a passable second half are some assets.

William acted as Speaker of the House of Commons and renounced the allegiance of England to Edward II, forcing his abdication, and became King Edward III's Secretary. Early life Trussell was born the son of William Trussell of Billesley, Warwickshire. Trussell was Sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire for 1314‚Äì15 and represented Leicestershire in Parliament in 1314 and Northamptonshire in 1319. He was an ardent supporter of the House of Lancaster but was pardoned for his role in the death of Piers Gaveston in 1318. Opposition to Edward II As Edward II slowly regained power from the Ordainers he rewarded Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester with land confiscated from the barons, leading to a baronial revolt, which Trussell joined. On 12 March 1322 a warrant for Trussell's arrest was issued describing him as \\"the King's enemy\\". Four days later both Trussell and his son fought on the rebels' side at the Battle of Boroughbridge. Edward and Dispenser won, beheading the rebels' leader Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster (Edward's cousin) and forcing others into exile. As the injustices continued, and the effects of the Great Famine of 1315‚Äì22 lingered, discontent remained. Despenser was rewarded with lands that had belonged to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, including those in Leicestershire. Trussell led a band of rebels that allegedly pillaged Despenser's estate at Loughborough in May 1322 but was imprisoned at Scarborough Castle in July. He escaped and allegedly fled south causing great havoc in Somerset and Dorset in August. On 14 March 1323, Roger de Beler, Richard de Willoughby and William de Gosefeld were issued with arrest warrants for Trussell, his son William, his brother Ralph, Roger la Zouch (son of Sir Roger la Zouch, Lord of Lubbesthorpe), Robert de Holland, 1st Baron Holand and others who were accused by Despenser of stealing horses, oxen, pigs, sheep and swans from his parks in Leicestershire. The warrant was reissued in 1324 alongside similar ones that dealt with alleged rioting against Despenser in Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Worcestershire by other rebels. Trussell fled to France and was not named as an accomplice of Zouch and the Folville Gang when they murdered/executed de Beler in January 1326, presumably in revenge for his enforcement on behalf of Despenser. Willoughby was later kidnapped and ransomed by them in 1332. Support of Edward III Trussell then joined up with Queen Isabella and Mortimer in Paris before moving to Flanders where he was allegedly tasked with helping to build an invasion army by William I, Count of Hainaut. Trussell accompanied Isabella and Mortimer when they landed in England on 24 September 1326 at the start of their invasion of England. Their forces consisted of approximately 1500 soldiers, many of whom were Flemish mercenaries and others exiled Contrariants. Opposition was almost non- existent and so many barons, sheriffs and knights joined the rebellion that control of the country was secured within two months. Adam, Abbot of Glastonbury hid Despenser and the Lord Chancellor, Robert Baldock in Glastonbury Abbey, and in December 1326 Trussell was ordered to bring the abbot before the next Parliament. Both Despenser and his son Hugh Despenser the Younger were captured and Trussell oversaw the trial of the elder Despenser where he was denounced and sentenced to death. Both Despensers were gruesomely executed. Trussell was appointed Speaker of the House of Commons and, acting as procurator of the whole Parliament, renounced allegiance to Edward II on 21 January 1327. Edward III was crowned as king on 1 February 1327 and Trussell went on to become the new king's Secretary and undertook numerous diplomatic missions, particularly to France and Spain. Trussell was buried in St Michael's chapel in Westminster Abbey in 1347.

According to the annual ISI Web of Knowledge list published by Thomson Reuters, she has been one of the most cited scientific researchers since 2003. Biography Alice Louise Alldredge was born in 1949 in Denver, Colorado, USA, graduated from Merrit Hutton High School in Thornton, Colorado, and completed an undergraduate degree in biology at Carleton College in 1971. Her father was an inspiration to her interest in science and her mother was a role-model as well. She continued her education to earn a PhD in 1975 from the University of California, Davis. Between 1975 and 1976, she studied at the Australian Institute of Marine Science as a NATO Postdoctoral Fellow. She joined the faculty of the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1976 and has conducted research on ocean ecology. She discovered the existence of abundant gel particles called Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) and demersal zooplankton, describing their migration and dispersion throughout coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and tidal sandflats. She is an authority on marine snow, the particles which settle to the bottom of the oceans, and the cycling in the sea of carbon. Through her work on marine snow, Alldredge changed the understanding of particle flux and she made the first quantification of observed sinking rates of marine snow, \\"showing that marine snow sinks rapidly enough to deliver significant amounts of organic carbon to the deep [sea]\\". In addition to her teaching and research at UC-Santa Barbara, Alldredge works at the Mo'orea Coral Reef as a researcher with the LTER Study in Mo'orea, French Polynesia studying the currents and forces effecting water transport of the island. In addition to evaluating the biological effect of zooplankton and fish on the reef, scientists are evaluating the biochemical characteristics and differences between waters over the reef and offshore waters. Alldredge has been credited for her role in UC-Santa Barbara's ranking as 7th best university worldwide based on its global scientific impact and collaboration record. She is in the top 0.1% of the ISI Web of Knowledge's highly cited researchers and has remained there since 2003.

It includes Grantham, Stamford, Bourne and The Deepings and covers an area of . The 2011 census reported a population of 133,788 people. The administrative centre of the district is Grantham. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \\"schedule\\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; Historic England takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \\"monument\\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War. There are 92 scheduled monuments in South Kesteven. Some of the oldest are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hill forts and bowl barrows. The Romano-British period is represented with several sites including the town of Ancaster and sections of major Roman engineering works such as the Car Dyke and Ermine Street. Religious sites are represented by Sempringham Priory, which was the founding location of the only purely English religious order, the Gilbertines; the list also includes Witham Preceptory, a Knights Templar preceptory between North and South Witham, and several friaries in the ancient town of Stamford. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles such as Bytham Castle and many village and churchyard standing crosses dating to the Middle Ages. The most recent monuments include two stone arch bridges built in the 16th and 17th centuries, and a village pump and milestone constructed near Normanton circa 1800. Three of the sites are located in more than one jurisdiction. The Deeping Gate Bridge crosses the River Welland into Cambridgeshire, the Neolithic settlement site east of Uffington and Barnack station straddles the boundary between Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, and Kennulph's Stone is a tripoint boundary marker at the intersection of South Kesteven, South Holland and the City of Peterborough.

He was educated at Trinity Grammar School, Kew and the Scotch College, Melbourne before going on to study Chemistry at the University of Melbourne 1922 to 1925.In April 1926 he travelled to the United Kingdom to work in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of London. In October 1926 he went to Caius College at Cambridge University to work under Prof Frederick Gowland Hopkins in their Biochemistry Laboratory. In the late 1920s he went to the Pasteur Institute in Paris where he met his wife-to-be. He returned to Cambridge in 1930, and received a PhD that year.http://epona.lib.ed.ac.uk:1822/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0254-UR- SF-34&view;=basic During the Second World War he undertook nutritional research for the government, and in 1940 took up the post of Lecturer in Biochemistry in the Department of Physiology at University College, Dundee from 1940. At this time the College, which later became a university in its own right was part of the University of St Andrews. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science (DSc) in 1942. He became an international authority on cholesterol, undertaking a large number experiments upon his own self including measuring the effect egg consumption had upon his blood. At Cook's suggestion the department was renamed the Department of Physiology and Biochemistry. In March 1966 he was made head of the newly independent Department of Biochemistry at Queen's College, Dundee, as University College had become known as in 1954. The college became the University of Dundee in 1967. In January 1972 he was awarded a personal chair in biochemistry at the university and in 1973, following his retirement due to ill health, he was made an emeritus professor. Cook's efforts in building up biochemistry in Dundee made it possible for the university to go on to become a leading institution for life science teaching and research. It was thanks to Cook that the university first appointed a professor of biochemistry in 1970, although he himself refused to be considered for the position, as he felt a younger candidate from outside the university should be appointed. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1946.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He died on 26 August 1989.

Carmen Pata has won numerous awards in Strongman competitions, Pan American Games, World Masters Games, and the U.S. National Meet, including a 1st-place finish at the 2013 PanAm Games in Chicago, a 1st-place finish at the U.S. National meet in 2012 in Savannah, Georgia, and was recognized as Minnesota's Strongest Man in 2010. Carmen Pata is still highly competitive in the +105 kg weight class. Pata continues to coach, train, and develop young athletes. He is the head Strength and Conditioning coach at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls where he is actively involved in all of the varsity sports team on campus and plays a major part in the community. He has helped thousands of Falcon student-athletes reach their potential by teaching them correct lifting techniques and specific lifts that help them in their specific sport. Background Carmen Pata grew up in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, being a three sport athlete of soccer, basketball, and track until his junior year, when he was introduced to football. From there, Carmen Pata excelled in the sport of football due to his intelligence and his willingness to work to become the best. Pata first came to UWRF from Oshkosh and played football for the Falcons from 1996-99. He started his football career at UWRF as a defensive lineman, but moved to the offensive line later. The Oshkosh Lourdes High School graduate was named to the first All-WIAC team after his senior season at UWRF. When Pata first came to River Falls he wanted to be a professional football player. But in 1998, while still a student, then football defensive coordinator and strength coach Tom Journell, gave Pata a chance to work in the athletic performance arena. Pata first helped with the Falcon softball and men's basketball teams. In 2001 he had a dual role as an athletic performance coach and assistant football coach. In 2006 he became UWRF's full-time athletic performance coach. Pata has loved coaching ever since, as he is able to help young adults achieve dreams they never thought they could and it allows him to continue his ancestry of engineers, as he is now a 5th generation engineer. Competition = Competition guidelines = The sport is controlled by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF). Based in Budapest, it was founded in 1905. The two competition lifts that are required in Olympic-style weightlifting are: the snatch and the clean and jerk. Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each, and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category. Bodyweight categories are different for women and men. A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total, and therefore receives an \\"incomplete\\" entry for the competition. The clean and press was once a competition lift, but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form. = Weightlifting career = Pata began his competitive weightlifting after his playing years for the UW- River Falls football team. He began in the spring of 2001 as a way to stay in shape and continue to be competitive at a high level. He started training for the Strongman competitions, while still coaching for the UWRF football staff. He began with small regional competitions throughout the state of Minnesota, winning multiple top 3 regional finishes, until he finally broke through the ranks and won the coveted award of Minnesota's Strongest Man in 2010. From there, Carmen Pata's name erupted onto the national and international weightlifting scene, as he won the U.S. National meet in Savannah, Georgia, in March 2012. Pata won with a total weight of 572 pounds (242 in the Snatch and lift and 330 in the Clean and Jerk) to qualify him for the Pan American Games in Chicago, Illinois that summer. From the U.S. National meet, Carmen Pata went on to the Pan American Games in Chicago in 2013 and won the entire event at the +105 kg weight class with a total weight of 643 pounds (286 pounds in the snatch and lift and 357 pounds in the clean and jerk). Pata has experienced major success in Olympic Weightlifting for how relatively new he is to the sport and he attributes it to his years of Strongman and his willingness to learn and grow. Pata's tear through the ranks continued for the next couple of years, as he has notched a 3rd-place finish at the 2014 Pan American games in the Dominican Republic, a 2nd-place finish at the 2013 U.S. National Meet in New Jersey, a 3rd-place finish at the 2014 Masters World Games in Italy. Coaching and mentoring =Coaching career= Carmen Pata has been the head Strength and Conditioning coach at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls since 2006 after five years of being an assistant football coach and strength coach. Pata has loved coaching ever since, as he is able to help young adults achieve dreams they never thought they could, and it allows him to continue his ancestry of engineers, as he is now a 5th generation engineer. A lasting symbol of Pata's goal to help his student athletes achieve greatness is an old school bell that is rung whenever an athlete has done something that they have never done before, whether it be a new bench press or a new vertical, no circumstance is too little to ring the bell. Carmen Pata has embodied the spirit of UWRF athletics, and continues to improve the campus and community through health and wellness. =Notable athletes coached= *Owen Schmitt (NFL)Owen Schmitt *Richard Melzer (NBA) *Joel Yogerst (Arena Football) *Ollie White and Ben Gressmer (Portugal Basketball League) *Jordan Crockett (2015 200m Outdoor National Champion) *10 NSCA All-Americans =Former staff members= *Kevin Schmalzried (St. Louis Cardinals Organization) *Wayne Tuckson (Syracuse University) *Andy King (San Francisco Giants organization) *David Kapping (University of Minnesota) *Beau DeBruin (Owner of Big Impact Fitness) *Jason Laube (Owner of Cutting Edge Fitness) References =External links= *UWRF Profile Category:Living people Category:American male weightlifters Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Carmen Pata"},{"id":"48451561","text":"Yukari Nonoshita is a Japanese classical soprano, appearing in opera and concert.

She took part in Historically informed performances, such as Maasaki Suzuki's project to record all cantatas by Bach, and the Baroque Opera Project of Ryo Terakado. A reviewer of volume 26 of Suzuki's project, which includes Schm√ºcke dich, o liebe Seele, BWV 180, praised her for \\"her clear upper range and refinement of detail in remarkably well-focused singing\\".

She is half of the original Creator Couple, seen most often as the wife of Chaac, who is the pre-eminent god of lightning and rain, although she is occasionally paired with the Creator God Itzamna in the Popol Vuh, the highland Maya bible. This highlights her importance, as dualities such as male/female and husband/wife were extremely important to the Maya, and one cannot function without the other. Chac Chel is also called Goddess O by many Mayanists and she is the aged, grandmotherly counterpart to the young goddess of childbirth and weaving, Ix Chel (also known as Goddess I and Ixik Kab). Most popular in the Late Classic and Postclassic Periods, she is most often depicted in scenes in the Dresden Codex and Madrid Codex. Depictions of her, and burial goods related to her, have also been found in Chichen Itza, the Balankanche Cave near Chichen Itza, Tulum, The Margarita Tomb in Copan, and in Yaxchilan.  Identification  In the Dresden Codex, Chac Chel is frequently depicted with a red body, a color of great power to the Maya, and which corresponds to the 'Chac' part of her name. While Chac Chel is the grandmotherly aspect of Ix Chel, she is not always depicted as kindly and benevolent. She is frequently shown as clawed and fanged, and she wears a diamond-patterned skirt decorated with crossed bones and other death symbols. Jaina figurines depicting Chac Chel also show her wearing white skirts with red spots and darker spotted skirts bearing the skull and crossbone motif. She also wears a twisted serpent headdress, linking her to the Divine Serpent, storms, and floods. She is also frequently depicted holding an upended water vessel, further tying her to the element of water. Images associating her with jaguars appear most often in the Postclassic, but in one Late Classic vessel, she is shown to have association with jaguars, as she bears a jaguar ear and a spotted \\"Ix\\" eye. She is also identified as a goddess of weaving by her occasional association with spiders and depictions of her with spindle whorls of cotton in her hair.  Meaning of the name  Schellhas first identified this goddess as Goddess O, and phonetic readings of the Goddess O name glyph identify her as the aged Ix Chel. However, further examination by Knorosov of the hieroglyphs that accompany her, especially the T109 'chac' prefix, concluded that her name actually reads \\"chac ch'el(e).\\" In Yucatac, \\"chac\\" means 'red' or 'great' and \\"chel\\" is the word for rainbow. Unlike Western traditions, the Maya view rainbows as harbingers of destruction, termination, and disease. Therefore, Chac Chel could mean \\"Great End\\", or \\"Red Rainbow\\" signifying that she is a goddess of floods and world destruction.  As a goddess of creation, fertility and life  In Maya mythology, the world emerged from a primordial cave of creation, from which rain, maize, and cacao (the necessities for human life) derived. In many scenes, Chac and Chac Chel are depicted with the hieroglyph representing this cave, \\"kab'ch'e'en\\", which shows that they are sometimes considered to be the couple of all creation. Rain and water were the most important of the 4 main elements to the Maya, as rain ensures successful crops. In many scenes, Chac Chel is seen holding an upended water jar, also seen to be used by Chacs, to dispense the rain that was invaluable to the agricultural fertility the Maya depended on. She is also seen holding Chac's serpent scepter of lightning, which causes the rains to fall and seeds to grow. Maize, or corn, was the most important Maya crop and they believed that humans were made from ground maize. In Tulum Mural 2, Chac Chel is depicted grinding the maize kernels that were used to form humans in Tulum Structure 16 she is depicted nursing a young Maize God. In some iconography we see that Corn God E sometimes wears Chac Chel's skirt, and it is known that elite male and female humans are shown performing a variety of rituals while wearing the skirt of Chac Chel. This donning of a deity's costume in order to be temporarily transformed into that deity and acquire the traits and powers of that god was common to the ancient Maya. The artifact assembly found in the Balankanche Cave links her further to life and creation as caves were commonly used for fertility rituals and rain ceremonies, and spindle whorls, manos, metates, and incense censors used to call forth rain clouds were found, as well as many artifacts relating to Tlaloc, the Aztec god of rain. There was also evidence of ritual activities that mimicked Chac Chel, including the pouring of water from jars and the symbolic grinding of maize to form humans. On the Birth Vase, Chac Chel is depicted at least 7 times in both her young Ix Chel and aged Chac Chel forms. On this vase, the aged Chac Chel is shown giving birth on a mountain, attended by midwives dressed like her, even though she would be too old to give birth at that age, strengthening her role as goddess of childbirth.  As a goddess of destruction  In many instances, Chac Chel is depicted as a goddess of destruction as well as creation, which fits with the ancient Maya emphasis on duality. In the Tulum Structure 16 murals, she wears a serpent headdress and holds another serpent in her hands, which could symbolize her role as the bringer of world-ending deluges. On page 30b of the Madrid Codex, she is seen standing with streams of blue water pouring from her loins and breasts while God B sits at her feet, indicating that she not only brings devastating floods, but also is of extreme importance, as males are rarely situated lower than females in Maya iconography. In other scenes, she is shown having an amorous affair with God B and in another; both deities are depicted among a flood that has destroyed the world. In bas-relief iconography from a column in the Lower Temple of the Jaguars in Chichen Itza, a skeletalized Chac Chel is shown with God N supporting an Atlantean figure wearing a cross-bone skirt.  As a goddess of weaving  Chac Chel is associated frequently with spiders, as well as cotton spindle whorls, which identify her with spinning, weaving, and cloth production in Postclassic Maya society. The fact that Chac Chel is a goddess of weaving made her extremely important, as cloth production was crucial to trade and religious rituals. On page 42b of the Dresden Codex, she appears standing on a serpent with a serpent headdress and 3 spindles wound with cotton thread in her hair. In the Margarita Tomb in Copan, Honduras the burial of an elite female contained dozens of items linking her to Chac Chel, including an Oliva shell inside a spondylus shell located on top of her pelvis (the child birthing aspect of Chac Chel), concentrations of jade beads along both sides of her lower body that may have been the remains of a jade skirt that showed her weaving prowess and emulation of Chac Chel, pyrite mirrors used in divination, and weaving tools such as spindle whorls and bone needles.Bell, Ellen (2002). Engendering a dynasty: A royal woman in the Margarita tomb, Copan. Ancient Maya Women, AltaMira Press, Walnut Creek, CA, 89-104. This burial may indicate that Maya elites partially legitimized their power and high status by associating with Chac Chel. There was also evidence that rituals venerating women were performed there for many years after the elite woman's burial, as weaving tool kits were carefully placed in the chamber.  As a diviner  Divination was extremely important to the Postclassic Maya, since virtually all events required a divination forecast, which greatly influenced the course of action taken by the participants and its outcome. The Maya generally used pyrite mirror, mirror bowls, and special stones to divine the future and the spirit world. On page 42a of the Dresden Codex, Chac Chel is depicted as sitting on a pyramid and holding a mirror bowl, containing the face of God C; and there were also pyrite mirrors found in the Margarita Tomb in Copan. Her serpent headdress may also indicate her role as a diviner, as the ancient Maya are commonly shown communing with deities and the divine forces via a Vision Serpent.  Central Mexican counterparts  Chac Chel seems to be closely related to several goddesses of Central Mexico. Aged goddesses wearing twisted serpent headdresses and with similar associations as Chac Chel are commonly found all over the Yucatec Maya region as well as the Valley of Mexico. She seems to be most similar to Cihuacoatl, the Aztec goddess of childbirth, the aged Aztec goddess of weaving Tlazolteotl, and the Tzitzimime, a set of celestial women that follow the same young/old aspects of Ix Chel/Chac Chel. She may also be related to Xochiquetzal, the wife of Chaac's Aztec counterpart Tlaloc, although Xochiquetzal may relate more with her Ix Chel aspect. She is also occasionally depicted wearing dress and hairstyles that closely resemble central Mexican styles during the Postclassic Period.  Popular Culture  Chac Chel is the focal point of the popular EDM song Chak Chel by Ganja White Night References Bibliography *Ardren, T.

Jayalalitha, her aide Sasikala Natarajan and her ministerial colleague, T. M. Selvaganapathy, were charged of misusing office to buy colour televisions at a higher price than quoted and receiving kickbacks to the tune of 10.16 crores. Jayalalitha, Sasikala and the seven others were arrested and remanded to judicial custody on 7 December 1998. The case and chargesheet were filed during the following DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) government headed by Karunanidhi in 1998. On 30 May 2000, Jayalalitha and Sasikala were acquitted, while T. M. Selvaganapathy and six others were convicted in the lower court, which sentenced them to five year rigorous imprisonment with a fine of 10,000. It was one of the first instances where an ex-chief minister was arrested and sent to jail. It was also one of the earliest instance when a Member of Parliament was convicted in a corruption case. Selvaganapathy was an MP in Lok Sabha during the time of verdict. The Madras High Court acquitted her and other all convicted in the case of all the charges on 4 December 2001. Background Jayalalithaa Jayaram (24 February 1948 ‚Äì 5 December 2016), commonly referred to as Jayalalithaa, was an Indian politician and three time Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu during various times from 1991‚Äì96, 2002‚Äì06 and 2011‚Äì14, 2015- 2016 from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) party. There were irregularities during her first tenure as Chief minister during 1991-96 for the purchase of 45,000 colour television sets to village panchayats to the tune of 10.16 Cr. The ruling DMK government (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) government headed by Karunanidhi filed the case in 1996 and chargesheet in 1998. Jayalalitha was arrested on 7 December 1996 and was remanded to judicial custody in connection with the case. The investigation alleged that the amount through the TV dealers were routed in the form of cheques to a relative of Sasikala, who had quoted Jayalalitha's residence as hers.Ghosh, p. 321 She earlier filed an anticipatory bail in the trial court, which was rejected on 7 December 1996. There were as many as 2,500 party men gathered around her residence to block her arrest, in spite of the cordon set by the Tamil Nadu Police. On 14 May 1998, a special court framed charges against the eleven accused in the case, namely, Jayalalitha, her aide Sasikala, the then Rural Affairs minister Selvaganapathy, the then Chief Secretary N Haribaskar, the then state Rural Development Secretary H M Pandey, the then former Rural Development Director M Satyamurthy, PA Jarnathanan, the minister's secretary and contractors, Doraisamy and Muthukumarasamy. The judge Radhakrishnan noted that there are enough evidence to frame the charges and he dismissed the petition filed by Jayalalitha and seven others to acquit them from the case. The Criminal Intelligence Division (CID) of Tamil Nadu, which handled the case argued that there were corruption to the tune of 10.16 Crores while buying 45,302 colour television sets for Panchayat community centres across the state during the regime of Jayalalitha during 1991-96. The judge framed charges under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 120(b) on Prevention of Corruption Act and sections 109 and 409. It was quoted in the chargesheet that the television sets were priced 14,500 against a market price of 12,000, creating a loss to the state exchequer. Baskaran, a relative of Sasikala was later included in the case. Trial The trial of the case started in the special court on 28 December 1998. As many as eighty witnesses from the prosecution side and two witness from the defence side were examined. The special court convicted seven of the nine accused of criminal conspiracy on 30 May 2000 under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced them to five year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 10,000. The seven were the then Rural Affairs minister Selvaganapathy, the then minister, the then Chief Secretary N Haribaskar, the then state Rural Development Secretary H M Pandey, the then former Rural Development Director M Satyamurthy, PA Jarnathanan, the minister's PA and two contractors, Doraisamy and Muthukumarasamy. The seven sentenced by the court were lodged in Vellore Central Prison the same evening. Jayalalitha, her friend Sasikala Natarajan and Sasikala's relative Baskaran, were acquitted as the accusation against them were not proven beyond doubt. The judge, in his verdict, stated that \\"Ms. Jayalalitha had no role in the conspiracy; even if it is presumed that there was violation of the financial code, it is not enough to show that she had participated in the conspiracy\\". Selvaganapathy, who was a member of the parliament during the time of verdict, was banned from the parliament after the verdict. The state government appealed against the acquittal of Jayalalithaa from the case. On 5 May 2000, the Supreme Court asked the High Court to give more time to Jayalalithaa to examine the defence witness based on the Special Leave Petition filed by her in the Supreme Court. The appeal of the state government was quashed by the Madras High Court on 21 August 2009. The court also acquitted the five-year sentence of the seven convicted by the lower court. Political implications It was one of the first instances where an ex-chief minister was arrested and sent to jail. It was also one of the earliest instance when a Member of Parliament was convicted in a corruption case. Selvaganapathy was an MP in Lok Sabha during the time of verdict. When Jayalalithaa was in jail for 30 days, her residence at Poes Gardens in Chennai was raided. Sun TV, the channel run by the nephew of Karunanidhi was allowed to video tape the raid, which created a huge controversy. The channel showed loads of jewellery and personal assets of Jayaalithaa, which subsequently landed in a wide political debate.

He is also a member of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), Europe's largest association of hackers.http://www.ccc.de/en/ Background He co-founded and is a managing partner at the security firm Krypton Security which helps test companies' security strengths, weaknesses, and potential loopholes. In an online report published on April 6, 2016, Sehnaoui was listed as one of the top 100 influencers in Information Security. Sehnaoui is often called upon to comment in media about Information Security matters. Early life and education Sehnaoui was born in Beirut, to parents Marwan Sehnaoui and Mouna Bassili Sehnaoui, on 23 May 1975 and grew up living between Paris, France and Beirut, Lebanon. His father is the President of the Lebanese Order of Malta and his mother is a Middle-East painter. He attended College Stanislas in Paris as well as Coll√®ge Louise Wegman in Beirut, following which he earned a BA in Management from Universite Saint Joseph in Beirut as well as a Masters in Economics. Media and television =Media= Sehnaoui was featured in The Guardian's video series \\"The Power of Privacy\\" in 2015. In May 2017 Sehnaoui went viral on Twitter and the internet after tweeting about getting revenge on loud and rude customers in a coffee shop. The customers were being loud and rude to waiters, and were having a very voluble conversation about their perfect new business name. As a retaliation Sehnaoui registered the domain name and tweeted about it. According to Mashable, \\"Twitter users praised Sehnaoui for his act of digital savagery\\". =Television= Sehnaoui was also featured on National Geographic in 2017 in the series Breakthrough, produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, Season 2 Episode 2, Cyber-Terror. This episode offered \\"An exclusive look inside the shadowy world of hackers, where good battles evil with the security of the world at stake. This episode follows ‚Äúwhite-hat‚Äù hackers Jayson Street, Darren Kitchen and Khalil Sehnaoui, security specialists who combine clever coding with ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù-style ‚Äúsocial engineering.‚Äù \\" Books In 2019 Sehnaoui was featured amongst 70 information security professionals in a book called \\"Tribe of Hackers\\", a collection of industry, career, and personal insights from cybersecurity luminaries. The book quickly rose to the #1 spot of new releases on Amazon in the Computer Security and encryption category. Controversies In 2015 there was a controversy when Sehnaoui identified that Silent Circle's warrant canary had been removed from their site. Sehnaoui was also prominently featured in a video series by The Guardian about privacy risks and is often called upon to comment on recent Information Security news. Before founding an information security firm he attempted to improve patient representation in the Lebanese insurance industry. Starting January 2016 there were reports that the Islamic State allegedly built a new Android app called Alrawi for exchanging encrypted messages, based on claims from online counter-terrorism firm Ghost Security Group (GSG). The claim was quickly reprinted by Newsweek, Fortune and TechCrunch, among others. Sehnaoui was one of the security specialists that helped debunk the myth of this tool, showing that it was just a \\"bad media mock-up to try and get some attention\\". In July 2018, he was arrested for alleged piracy of several Lebanese companies and government institutions, his detention was illegal as there is a legal vacuum in Lebanese laws about cybercrime. He was released after being questioned and no charges were brought against him.

These discussions led to a decision to hold a meeting in which local representatives from Arrowsic, Bath, Georgetown, Phippsburg, West Bath and Woolwich would discuss such issues. Soon after, an organizational committee was formed. In the winter of 1991, KELT received its first easement, made up of a major portion on Long Island across from Fort Popham.

He has translated several medieval cookbooks from Arabic to English and published widely on the history of food, particularly of the Middle East and California. He also authored or co-authored books about San Francisco the 1960s, and was a prolific journalist for Rolling Stone, the Los Angeles Times and other publications.  Biography  Perry was born in Los Angeles, California in 1941 and attended public schools. From 1959 to 1961, he majored in Middle Eastern studies at Princeton University. In 1961, he transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, and in 1962 he spent a year at the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies in Shemlan, Lebanon, where he earned the British Foreign Office‚Äôs higher standard interpretership certificate. He graduated from Berkeley in 1964. In his senior year, one of his roommates was the future ‚ÄúLSD millionaire‚Äù Owsley Stanley; as a result of their friendship, Perry was present for most of the great events of the San Francisco psychedelic scene of the mid-1960s. In 1968, he started working at Rolling Stone and was the first editorial employee who lasted more than a few weeks. He remained at Rolling Stone as an editor and staff writer until 1976, when he left to write The Haight-Ashbury: A History for Random House. While working on the book, he moved back to Los Angeles to pursue a new career as a freelance food writer in 1978. His business card read ‚ÄúMy pledge: never to use the words ‚Äòeminently,‚Äô ‚Äòdelectable‚Äô or ‚Äòmorsel‚Äô‚Äù. In 1980, he spent two months in Egypt, Syria and England collecting medieval Arabic cookery manuscripts and subsequently added more from Turkey and elsewhere. In 1981, he attended the first full Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery. In the 1980s he became one of the major contributors to Symposium co-founder Alan Davidson‚Äôs Petits Propos Culinaires and to The Oxford Companion to Food. He later served as a trustee of the Symposium from 2004 to 2008. In 1990, he became a staff writer for the food section of the Los Angeles Times, where he remained until 2008. In 1995, he co-founded the Culinary Historians of Southern California and has served as its president since that time. Perry‚Äôs grandmother was pioneer Hollywood screenwriter and film editor Kate Alaska Corbaley and his younger sister was the volleyball star and Olympic athlete Mary Perry. He lives in the Los Angeles area and continues to contribute scholarly and popular articles about food to such publications as Saudi Aramco World and the Istanbul-based Cornucopia. He has contributed papers to most Oxford Symposiums since 1981 and lectures about food history in the U.S. and Turkey.

She is an executive editor of the Hindi news channel Aaj Tak.  Early life and education  Anjana was born to Omprakash Tiwari, in the Bhumihar caste, at Ranchi (then part of Bihar). Omprakash was a doctor on short-service-commission with the Indian Army, and served during the Bangladesh War of Independence. She had her initial schooling at Loreto Convent, a local Catholic school and then, from Delhi Public School, Ranchi. She went on to pursue a honours in botany, from under University of Delhi, despite having no natural inclination for science; Anjana went on to appeared for the All India Pre Medical Test but failed to pass. She was a prolific debater and exhibited strong leadership qualities since childhood, having become the head-girl in both the schools and the president of her college hostel. After a few years, she enrolled at the Delhi School of Social Work, for her post-graduation; Anjana mentions of the curricula and field-visits inculcating a spirit of public activism in her.  Career  Anjana's first job was as a counselor at the Daewoo Motors; however, she did not like the job and resigned after about a year. She then joined an NGO in the roles of a legal counselor, for slum-dwellers. = Journalism = In the early 2000s, Anjana opted for a diploma in journalism, from Jamia Millia Islamia, primarily on the insistence of her husband. Upon graduation, she was inducted in Doordarshan with some aid from acquaintances; she was assigned to the news-desk of Aankhon Dekhi, an investigative show but was allotted infrequent reporting duties, as well. Within a year, she moved to Zee News. Whilst she wanted to be an anchor all through-out; the channel found her lacking in speaking finesse and employed her in producing roles. In her later years at Zee, she successfully passed the auditions and were occasionally used as an anchor for special features. In 2007, she joined News 24, where she was, for the first time, assigned a mainstream role at anchoring in the form of moderating an evening debate show. She left the venture in early 2012 and moved to Star News; however, it was shut down months later. Anjana thus became one of the several journalists, to follow her immediate ex-boss at News24 ‚Äì Supriya Prasad from News 24 to Aaj Tak, around late 2012. = Views = Anjana has been noted to be a strong voice against reservations in India for socially oppressed classes and likewise affirmative actions; in a media-panel discussion, she had once described the system to be infested by 'termites', which brought neither social mobility nor economic affluence for the target- populace. She mentions her Brahminical upbringing and the social tensions prevalent in the aftermath of enacting Mandal Commission recommendations, as contributing factors.  Reception  = The Caravan = A long-form piece over The Caravan (by Nikita Saxena), has been highly critical of Anjana's journalism, noting the aggressive propagation of Hindutva centered ideologies and biased reporting in favour of the Bharatiya Janata Party, across a variety of situations. Scroll.in has noted her to be an establishment friendly news anchor. Kashyap was one of the few reporters, who were allowed an interview by Modi, in the run-up to the 2019 National Elections; Saxena notes that Kashyap refused to pose any challenging question to him. A self-delivered monologue about Modi, in the immediate aftermath of the 2014 elections was basically a hagiographic sketch, that carefully omitted any and all criticisms including his questionable roles in the 2002 Gujarat riots. In late August 2019, when released data shew that the national GDP was growing at the slowest rate in about a decade, and generated widespread concerns about Indian economy under the premiership of Modi, Anjana's daily flagship show Halla Bol did not raise the issue a single time across the entire month of September. Kashyap's reporting of the 2019 Supreme Court proceedings on Ayodhya title dispute heavily toed a pro-BJP line with numerous debates and special shows, that spanned avast avenue from seeking the reasons behind a routine deferment of the case (around October '18) to inquiring about why the Muslims were unable to compromise with a mere 5 acre land, and the timeline of Ram Mandir construction, all along with provocative headlines and audience-polls; it ended with welcoming the final verdict in favour of the Hindus, as a sacred occasion. Topics of her flagship shows had ranged from debating whether goats should be sacrificed on the Islamic occasion of Eid al-Adha to dog-whistle commentary on the issue of Muslim population growth and usage of fringe religious figureheads, to point out conservatism in Islam. = Muzaffarpur Hospital incident = While reporting about the 2019 Bihar encephalitis outbreak, Anjana entered the neonatal ICU at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital and started haranguing the on-duty paediatrician. She was widely criticised for her inappropriate behaviour. The Indian Medical Association subsequently filed a complaint against her, for \\"endangering the lives of children\\", in an attempt to gain \\"publicity\\". She has also been documented to have misreported news on certain occasions according to fact checking organisations such as Alt News.  Personal life  Anjana is married to Mangesh Kashyap, an officer of the 1995 Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Police Service cadre. She met Mangesh during her days at Delhi University. Mangesh was the erstwhile Addl. Deputy Commissioner of the Delhi Police and since 2016, has been the Chief Vigilance Officer of South Delhi Municipal Corporation. They have a son and a daughter.

He is best remembered as one of the most prominent African-American Republicans of the first two decades of the 20th century and as a leader of the dominant black- and-tan faction of the Republican Party of Georgia. He was appointed by President William Howard Taft as Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia, at the time regarded as the premier political patronage position reserved for black Americans, and one of four appointees known as Taft's \\"Black Cabinet\\". Following the Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson, Johnson was again appointed Recorder of the Deeds for the District in June 1921 by Republican President Warren G. Harding, but his appointment was rejected by the United States Senate, meeting in executive session and based largely on the opposition of the two Democratic senators from Georgia, a prerogative of the Senate. His rejection garnered newspaper headlines and marked the finish of Johnson's national political influence. Harding's administration worked with Georgia Republicans to reorganize the party to reduce black-and-tan influence, already declining due to the state's disenfranchisement of black voters. Johnson returned to his law practice in the capital. He died on September 10, 1925 at the Freedmen's Hospital after having a stroke at his home in Washington, D.C.. Biography =Early years= Attorney Linc Johnson as a young man. Henry Lincoln Johnson, known to family and friends as \\"Linc,\\" was born on July 27, 1870 in Augusta, Georgia to former slaves Martha Ann and Peter Johnson. His parents strongly encouraged education. Johnson attended Atlanta University, a historically black college, and graduated in 1888. Excluded from law schools in the South because of segregation, he went north to attend the University of Michigan, obtaining a law degree in 1892. After passing the Georgia bar exam, Johnson opened a law practice in Atlanta. He eventually became the corporate attorney for the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, a major black-owned business.Herman Mason, Politics, Civil Rights, and Law in Black Atlanta, 1870-1970. Mount Pleasant, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2000; pg. 56. In 1903 Johnson married Georgia Douglas, who also graduated from what is now Clark Atlanta University. She was 10 years younger than he. She achieved literary fame as a poet associated with the Harlem Renaissance. Together the couple had two sons, Peter Douglas Johnson and Henry Lincoln Johnson, Jr. The latter became a notable attorney in his own right. =Political leader= In Washington D.C. in 1914 New York Age September 19, 1925 obituary for Henry Lincoln Johnson According to his death notice in the New York Age, Johnson was a law partner of Bill Pledger and succeeded him in political office. During the first years of the 20th century, Johnson emerged as a leading boss in Georgia Republican politics.Robert E. Hauser, \\"'The Georgia Experiment': President Warren G. Harding's Attempt to Reorganize the Republican Party in Georgia,\\" Georgia Historical Quarterly, vol. 62, no. 4 (Winter 1978), pg. 289. Johnson's role was that of the chief dispenser of political patronage to black Republicans in the state, at a time when their ability to elect representatives of their choice was being limited by voter fraud, suppression and, in 1909, constitutional amendments and laws passed by white Democrats in the state legislature that disenfranchised most black voters.Donald Lee Grant, The Way It Was in the South: The Black Experience in Georgia. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2001; pg. 336. Blacks continued to be a loyal and important component of the Republican Party coalition in the era. Johnson was described by one journalist of the era as a \\"tall figure with an oratorical turn of phrase and an emphatic style of expression.\\"\\"Link Johnson in Conference with Coolidge\\", Pittsburgh Courier, vol. 14, no. 37 (Sept. 29, 1923), pg. 1. In 1910 Johnson was appointed by President William Howard Taft as Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia. This was regarded as the premier political patronage job, which had been historically earmarked for African Americans since after the Civil War.J. Clay Smith, Jr., Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer, 1844-1944. Philadelphia, PA: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999; pg. 195. Also appointed by Taft were James Carroll Napier as Register of the Treasury, Robert Heberton Terrell as District of Columbia Municipal Judge, and William H. Lewis as Assistant United States Attorney General, making up what was known as his \\"Black Cabinet.\\" In JSTOR Johnson and his family moved from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. to undertake this new position.Carmine D. Palumbo,\\"Georgia Johnson\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia, 2003; revised 2013. Johnson is believed to have worked behind the scenes for the election of Southern Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 Presidential election, as did other black leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois of the NAACP, William Monroe Trotter of the National Equal Rights League, and Bishop Alexander Walters and J. Milton Waldron, prominent clergymen, all of whom opposed Booker T. Washington's politics and were disappointed at the Republican Party's tepid response to their issues. Johnson continued in his federal position until the Wilson administration purged African American and other Republicans from the patronage positions in the customary change after a new president of a different political party was elected. More significantly, influenced by Southern members of his cabinet, Wilson segregated federal offices, lunchrooms, and restrooms for the first time. In 1914 the Civil Service Commission began to require photos with job applications, a means to screen out blacks. Other forms of racial discrimination were used against African-American federal workers during the Wilson administration. The NAACP and other leading black groups protested but were unsuccessful in changing these policies and many African Americans were affected, both in Washington and nationally. In 1912, at the beginning of Taft's administration, some 19,000 African Americans were working nationwide for such departments as the Treasury, Post Office (including railway postal workers), Navy, and Bureau of Engraving and Printing Office. Johnson was sharply criticized for hubris by the black socialist magazine, The Messenger. It criticized him as an example of a \\"sleek, fat, potbellied Negro politicians who have been trafficking for half a century in the sweat and blood and tears of toiling Negro washerwomen, cotton pickers, miners, and factory hands.\\"The Messenger, quoted in Grant, The Way it was in the South, pg. 336. During the 1916 Presidential election, the tensions of the Republican Party of Georgia resulted in two rival factions: a group of African-American-dominated regulars headed by Johnson, commonly known as the \\"black and tans\\", and an insurgency of European Americans commonly known as the \\"lily whites\\". Johnson managed to retain control of the party apparatus in the presidential election year of 1916 and again in 1920. By controlling the Georgia delegation to the Republican National Convention in those years, he retained control over federal patronage appointments in Georgia. In 1920, Johnson was among black leaders of the Republican Party who met in Chicago to establish the Lincoln League. This intra-party group formed to attempt to force the national Republican Party to take a firm stand against lynching, Jim Crow laws, voter disfranchisement, and other assaults upon the African-American community in the South. From 1890 to 1909, all states of the South had passed laws to disenfranchise most blacks and many poor whites. Johnson won promises that the Republican Party would take more determined action on these matters if it won the White House in the fall of 1920. In 1920 Johnson was elected as Georgia's representative to the Republican National Committee. The selection had not been without controversy, and Johnson had concealed his candidacy until the last minute, when he was elected by the loyal Georgia delegation over his white rival, Roscoe Pickett, 12 votes to 3, with two abstaining.George L. Hart (ed.), Official Report of the Proceedings of the Seventeenth Republican National Convention: Held in Chicago, Illinois, June 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, 1920... New York: The Tenny Press, 1920; pp. 92-93. Under the standing rules of the convention, the full convention was required to ratify the selection of each state's delegation, which was usually a pro forma voice vote. But when the Georgia delegation reported their selection on the floor and the pro forma voice vote was taken, a chorus of voices were raised in opposition to Johnson. A two-thirds vote of the convention was required to set aside the standing rules and overturn the Georgia delegation's selection. The delegates did not gain sufficient votes for such action, and thereby ratified the choice of Johnson. This averted what would have been a potential election-year embarrassment of the Republicans as they were seeking to retain black voters outside the South. =Failed nomination of 1920= Henry Lincoln Johnson as the new \\"GOP Boss\\" of Georgia on the front page of the Atlanta Constitution in June 1920 Johnson's status was bolstered by the strong showing of Republicans in the Presidential election of 1920. The party gained its largest vote in the South in four decades.Hauser, \\"'The Georgia Experiment,'\\" pg. 288. But the brewing factional breach in the Republican Party of Georgia between Johnson's \\"black and tans,\\" and the group of European Americans known as the \\"lily whites\\" erupted in the aftermath of the election. The two groups battled for influence with the new Republican administration of Warren G. Harding to control federal patronage in the state. Harding reacted to the factional split with an attempt to reorganize the Republican Party in Georgia independently of these two feuding groups.Hauser, \\"'The Georgia Experiment,'\\" pg. 290. In April 1921 five prominent Georgia business leaders were called to the White House by President Harding. He asked lumber mill owner John Louis Philips to conduct an initial survey of Georgia business figures to determine their potential level of support for joining a new, reorganized Georgia Republican Party.Hauser, \\"'The Georgia Experiment,'\\" pp. 290-291. Harding's machination was endorsed by the \\"lily whites,\\" who believed it could be a means to establish white hegemony, even if those chosen to head the reorganization were selected from outside factional ranks.Hauser, \\"'The Georgia Experiment,'\\" pg. 291. Johnson had the most to lose from Harding's reorganization effort and opposed it. Johnson was ultimately induced to quit the factional battle and to exit Georgia politics through a reappointment by Harding to the choice position of Registrar of Deeds for the District of Columbia. After Johnson was appointed in June 1921 and moved again to Washington,\\"'Link' Johnson Nomination Rejected by U.S. Senate: Negro is Refused Job as Recorder of Deeds in DC,\\" Atlanta Constitution, vol. 54, no. 164 (Nov. 23, 1921), pg. 1. a handpicked Republican convention of 230 people, predominantly consisting of white business leaders, reorganized the Georgia party on July 26, 1921. Johnson's appointment was taken up by the United States Senate for ratification in November 1921. There Georgia Democratic Senator Tom Watson, a political foe and supporter of white supremacy, led a fight against Johnson's confirmation in committee and on the floor of the Senate. Watson charged that the appointment of Johnson was \\"personally obnoxious to him\\", as Johnson had said in an interview with an African- American newspaper from Baltimore that he would \\"rather be in hell without Tom Watson than to be in heaven with him.\\" Watson charged that Johnson had engaged in financial shenanigans in Atlanta which made him unsuitable for government trust. When senators met in executive session, Georgia's other Senator, white Democrat Nathaniel Edwin Harris, reportedly joined Watson in pronouncing Johnson \\"personally obnoxious to him,\\" code words invoking an unwritten rule in the Senate granting de facto veto power to senators over appointments relating to their states.\\"Unwritten 'Obnoxious Rule' Usually Observed in Senate,\\" Wilmington News, vol. 62, no. 136 (July 17, 1956), pg. 4. The vote against Johnson which followed was virtually unanimous; only one Senator voted for Johnson's appointment over the objections of the Georgians. =Death and legacy= After his 1921 confirmation defeat in the Senate, Johnson returned to legal practice in Washington, D.C.; his place in national politics was thereafter limited. One of Johnson's most famous cases came in 1922, when he was called to defend a young black man charged with sexual assault of a white girl below the age of consent.Smith, Emancipation, pg. 196. These extremely serious charges carried a potential penalty of 30 years in prison or execution. The young man was also at risk for extrajudicial lynching. Following expert cross-examination in the case, Johnson delivered what was called by one observer one of the \\"most eloquent and forceful\\" closing arguments ever heard in a District of Columbia court. The jury failed to agree in the case after six hours of deliberation, with seven jurors voting for acquittal. The foreman later commented that the defendant owed his life to Johnson's summation.Smith, Emancipation, pg. 196-97. Despite his removal from Georgia politics, Johnson was not entirely forgotten in the corridors of power. In September 1923 Johnson was one of a handful of black political leaders invited to Washington, D.C. for private consultations with President Calvin Coolidge on issues of concern to the African-American community. They continued to seek more national support for alleviating oppression in the South. Henry Lincoln Johnson died on September 10, 1925 at Freedmen's Hospital after having a stroke at his home in Washington, D.C.\\"H. L. Johnson Dies: A Republican Leader: Negro National Committeeman Had Won Fights for Seat at Two Conventions,\\" New York Times, Sept. 11, 1925. He was 55 years old at the time of his death. He was buried on September 14, 1925, at Columbian Harmony Cemetery. His remains were moved to National Harmony Memorial Park Cemetery in 1959, when Columbian Harmony closed.

Unlike the comics Red was not active as a lawman, but mostly worked as a cowhand. Only when the stories asked for it did he get involved in acting like a (deputy) sheriff. Red also never killed his enemies, only shot their guns out of their hands. Another difference was the name of Red's sweetheart. In the comics her name was Beth Wilder, while on the radio she was named Jane Bruce. Originally the show was successful enough to beat its rival, The Lone Ranger, in radio ratings.

Early life The son of Sherington Talbot of the 38th Foot and his wife Elizabeth Medget(t), and grandson of William Talbot the Bishop of Durham, he was the elder brother of Sir Charles Henry Talbot, 1st Baronet. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1737, graduating B.A. and M.A. in 1744.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Talbot, William (3) Talbot of Kineton Talbot was ordained priest by Thomas Secker, then Bishop of Oxford, at the end of 1745. A friend of Sanderson Miller, Talbot is thought by Hawkes to have owed him his appointment to the Kineton living. Miller made changes to Kineton Church, for Talbot, in a Gothic Revival style, in 1755‚Äì6. In 1757 Talbot was one of group of evangelical preachers invited during the summer season to Cheltenham, by William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.With Downing, Martin Madan, Stillingfleet and Samuel Walker of Truro. At this period he was also under the influence of Lady Huntingdon, and spent time as a peripatetic \\"field preacher\\", to be found with Martin Madan in Northamptonshire as reported by James Hervey. His friend Thomas Haweis, then recently ordained, gave his view of Talbot's conversion of the late 1750s to evangelical views in writing to Samuel Walker of Truro in 1759: > \\"His living is nothing in value, but most laborious in service. He took it > merely with a view to do good, having that desire in great simplicity, > before he could be at all said to be evangelical, which he has been about a > twelvemonth or more. He had always a doctrinal knowledge of the scheme, but > till then, no inward experimental acquaintance with it.\\" Talbot supported Miller when in the throes of mental illness in the 1750s.http://www.banburymuseum.org/Cake%20and%20Cockhorse/VOL_04/V04NO06.pdf p. 91 It was Talbot who arranged for Miller's care during his breakdown of 1759, first with Robert James. Miller was then taken to an asylum in Hoxton, thought to be a referral from James to Isaac Schomberg. Talbot's actions were resented by Miller, and their friendship ended. In 1762, Talbot stepped into a dispute between Haweis and John Hume, Bishop of Oxford. The intervention was unavailing, as was an appeal to Thomas Secker, by then the Archbishop of Canterbury, by Haweis; and he had to leave Oxford where his Methodism was unacceptable for London. As a tactic, Talbot and his ally Joseph Jane were probing the powers of the bishops to restrict curacies: Haweis had held one at St Mary Magdalen's Church, Oxford, and Talbot offered himself in his place. Later life Talbot was presented to St Giles' Church, Reading, around 1768, where he succeeded James Yorke; this was an exchange of livings, and it took place after Secker had presented Talbot to the London church All Hallows, Thames Street. Yorke was the same time Dean of Lincoln. The Secker and Talbot families were close. In Reading, Talbot continued with a pastorate of the same kind as in Kineton. Sir Richard Hill, 2nd Baronet, a friend from this time, found his views those of a \\"moderate Calvinist\\". Talbot died on 2 March 1774, at the house of his friend William Wilberforce, uncle of the abolitionist Member of Parliament; his death was attributed to a fever caught on a pastoral visitation. Evangelical legacy Talbot's successor at St Giles was William Bromley Cadogan. Opposed to the views of John Wesley, and regarded by Richard Cecil as a Calvinist of High Church views on polity, Cadogan was subsequently much influenced by Talbot's widow Sarah in the direction of a similar evangelical approach as parish priest. It was after a difficult start, in which Talbot's curate John Hallward was dismissed by Cadogan; he was found a living at Shawbury by Sir Richard Hill. Charles Parsons, who had worked as a servant for both Talbot and Wilberforce, became the first nonconformist minister in Kineton. The Jonathan Britain case As a prison visitor in Reading, Talbot became involved in the case of the forger Jonathan Britain, executed in 1772. In 1771 one of Britain's victims asked Talbot to visit Britain, held then in a compter called Abbey Gateway, attached to St Laurence's Church, Reading, and so in a different parish. Setting aside protocol, Talbot saw Britain, an unrepentant fantasist. His involvement continued to the point of Britain being brought to trial in a different city. Talbot wrote a book defending his conduct in the matter, which had aroused public comment. Britain had been employed in Bristol as an usher in the mathematical school run by Benjamin Donne. Talbot's actions in following up forgeries in Reading to a prosecution in Bristol have been presented as vindictive. Britain, who had become a soldier, had attracted attention by relating treasonous activities, including a plot to assassinate the king. Family Talbot married Sarah Eyles, daughter of John Eyles. His support for the antiquarian and biographer George Ballard brought a dedication of Ballard's work Memoirs of British Ladies to Sarah; she and Ballard corresponded. Sarah outlived her husband, on good terms with William Romaine and John Newton, and visited by Henry Venn and Rowland Hill. She died in 1785. In literature Talbot is mentioned in Richard Jago's long poem of 1767 on Edge Hill, Warwickshire, not far from Kineton to the south.
