Dr. Price is regarded as the first black Panamanian to hold a medical degree in early republican Panama. Early life Jos√© Antonio Price was born in Santa Ana, Panama City, former Republic of Colombia in 1890 and was the only son of Hilda Price, an immigrant from British Honduras. He moved very early on his life to the western part of the Isthmus, to the Caribbean location of Bocas del Toro where he spent the majority of his life and career. At the beginning of the 20th century, Bocas del Toro was a prominent international port, home to the first international headquarter of the United Fruit Company. The Banana Industry prompted a massive wave of Afro-Caribbean immigration from places such as Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and Martinique. Due to its vibrant economy, Bocas del Toro also welcomed Germans, French, American, British and Chinese merchants, giving birth to a multicultural society. Education Price attended high school in Kingston, Jamaica before traveling to the south of the United States, where he became an alumnus of two Historically Black Colleges, Shaw University at Raleigh, North Carolina where he attended special courses from 1907-1909 and University of West Tennessee College of Medicine and Surgery in Memphis, where he obtained his medical degree in 1913 under the guidance of professor Miles Vandahurst Lynk. Price spoke fluent Spanish, English and French. Professional career Jose Antonio Price became a pioneer of private medicine in the Republic of Panama. Upon his return to Bocas del Toro in 1913, he started a private practice in his own medical facility called ¬¥Hospital Santa Fe¬¥, located at Four Street and Central Avenue. He also established a drugstore ‚ÄúFarmacia Central‚Äù which was the largest in town. These health facilities were instrumental on coping with a large demand of medical services by a very diverse population reaching almost 23,000. In the early nineteen twenties president Belisario Porras started a nationalization campaign of Panama's public health which was largely in hands of the Americans since 1904. During this period Jose Antonio Price served as Official Doctor of the indigenous region of Chiriqu√≠ Occidente and Official Doctor of the province of Darien. Dr. Price also held multiple government appointments in Bocas del Toro such as Sanitary Doctor and Forensic Doctor. There is evidence that Dr. Price also provided free medical services to the poor over an entire career that spanned for almost forty years. Political career Jose Antonio Price was a Liberal radical and a close political ally to Carlos Antonio Mendoza, Belisario Porras, Francisco Arias Paredes and Ernesto de la Guardia. He served as an elected member of the Municipal Council of Bocas del Toro, representing different factions of the Liberal party such as Partido Liberal, Partido Liberal Renovador and Partido Liberal Unido. Personal life Price married Liliane Maud Georget Smith, of French descent in 1915, a daughter of Louis Victor Georget, former Superintendent of the United Fruit Co., who died in 1908. He remarried in 1941 to Maria America Vernaza Boyes a Granddaughter of General Heliodoro Vernaza who fought next to Victoriano Lorenzo in the Thousand Days' War . Together they had three children Juan Antonio, Jose Antonio and Desiree Antonia. Price died of cancer on Col√≥n Island, Bocas del Toro in 1951.

She gained national infamy when hidden videos were released of her taking money that she alleged was for party funding. She subsequently became known on social media as La Recaudadora (The Collecter). Early life Cadena was born in Tlalmanalco, Estado de M√©xico and moved to Las Choapas, Vercruz at age 7. Career Cadena Sandoval began her career with a short-lived step by the ranks of the PRI in the early 2000s, but is expelled for not covering her quotas and begins to perform political work in the ranks of (PAN) National Action alongside Antonio Pouchoulen and Renato Tronco, from 2005 to 2013. With Morena, at 2016 she was a deputy in the state congress of Veracruz. She was a candidate for the mayorship of Las Choapas, but her candidacy was revoked by the party following the scandal of the hidden videos. Scandal A first video, published on April 24, 2017, shows Cadena taking $500,000 Mexican pesos from a woman whose face is not visible, with the money supposedly going to MORENA leader Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador. In regards to this video, L√≥pez Obrador said it was a \\"trick\\" released to slander and politically destroy the party. Cadena claimed L√≥pez Obrador did not know about the money and that she returned all of it. A second video, published on April 27, 2017, shows Cadena taking from the same woman $10,000 US dollars and $50,000 Mexican pesos, supposedly \\"for her campaign\\". The woman offers an additional $5,000,000 pesos for L√≥pez Obrador but would like to meet him in person, to which Cadena responds that she will tell \\"them\\". She claimed this video was recorded when she went to return the money. The videos were leaked to the national newspaper El Universal which subsequently published them. In an interview with the newspaper, Cadena claimed that the videos were altered and that she had asked the Attorney General of Veracruz to seek security videos from the hotel in which the transactions took place to find those responsible for the hidden videos. The Fiscal√≠a Especializada para la Atenci√≥n de Delitos Electorales (FEPADE) opened an investigation on Cadena's presumed misconduct. A third video published by El Universal on May 2, 2017 shows Cadena receiving $1,000,000 pesos from a supposed businessman as payment for her pushing for a favorable law in the Veracruz state congress. The day before the third leak, Cadena stated she would step down to face charges, that the videos were altered and that she would release the names of those involved. The same day the video was released, she failed to attend a scheduled meeting with FEPADE. The actions in the third video may constitute additional crimes that are outside of FEPADE jurisdiction and would require investigation from other agencies.

Five of its Catholic Bishops are historically recorded: * Felix participated in a synod called by bishop Gratus of Carthage in 349 * Beianus, on the side of Maximianus of Carthage against the Donatist heresy in 394. * Valentinus attended as Catholic bishop the Council of Carthage in 411, held by the command of the (Western) Roman Emperor Honorius, as did his Donatist counterpart Quintasius, on that very heresy. * Valentinus participated as Primate of Numidia the synod of Carthage in 419, regarding the question of appeals to Rome. * Asclepius, author writing against Arianism and Donatism, mid fifth centuryGennadio di Marsiglia, De viris illustribus, chapter 73.

Thus, creatures immediately are propelled by God not only according to their origin (creation) and conservation in existence, but also in their causal operations.  Biblical support  In support of the concept a biblical passage in the book of Isaiah is often cited: \\"indeed, all that we have done, you [God] have done for us.\\" (Isaiah 26:12 NRSV). In the New Testament I Corinthians is often cited. There the apostle Paul commented upon his missionary work, \\"I labored more than anyone else--yet it was not I but the grace of God working through me.\\" (I Corinthians 15:10).  In Catholic theology  In Catholic theology, a distinction is made between concursus simultaneus and concursus praevius, the former being divine influence into the effect of a second cause, parallel, as it were, with its activity, whereas the latter involves divine influence into the causing agent. Thomists insist on both kinds of concursus being required in any action of a created cause and provide an elaborate theory of the \\"previous concursus\\", calling it physical premotion. Other theological schools, especially the Jesuits, typically reject physical premotion and claim that concursus simultaneus is sufficient. The theory of concursus is not meant to compromise freedom of will; however, the Thomist doctrine of praemotio physica is blamed of achieving precisely that by its opponents. Another distinction is between concursus ordinarius (generalis, naturalis) and concursus extraordinarius. Whereas the ordinary concursus is part of the natural order and accompanies every causal activity of a secondary cause whatsoever, an extraordinary concursus is of supernatural order, it is the extraordinary help of divine grace to a created free agent.  Proponents  Notable proponents of this teaching include the renowned German philosopher Leibniz,Leibniz on Divine Concurrence as well as Descartes and Spinoza. Spinoza, Principles of Descartes' Philosophy It is also a concept currently invoked by Calvinist theologians.R.C. Sproul, \\"Divine Concurrence.\\" In Catholic theology, the doctrine of divine concursus is considered a sententia communis and is shared by almost all theologians (a notable exception being Durandus of Saint-Pour√ßain). The most important proponents of the Thomist version are Domingo B√°√±ez and Diego √Ålvarez; while their most notable Jesuit opponents are Luis de Molina and Francisco Su√°rez.

This is notable because around this time a vigorous debate about the role of women as preachers was taking place in religious periodicals like the Gospel Advocate, Christian Standard, and Christian-Evangelist. Early life Sarah Catherine McCoy, nicknamed Sadie, was born on August 15, 1863 near Breckenridge, Illinois. Her mother had twelve children from two husbands. Her second husband, Sadie's father, was an alcoholic who failed to support the family and was abusive. Despite her father's efforts to make her stay, she went to work for the county school superintendent when she was 16 years of age. In exchange, she was given room and board and was able to continue attending school. The small salary that she earned provided support for her mother and the children who were at home. She then became a schoolteacher. Although exposes to the Primitive Baptist religion of her parents, Crank found an affinity with the preachings of Elder Wilson, a Christian Church minister and was baptized in May 1887 at Bear Creek in Illinois. Preacher She was hired by Sunday school evangelist for the Illinois State Sunday School Society by James Rawser Crank. While holding an institute at Marcelline, Illinois, 96 attendees decided that they wished to be baptized into the faith. Sadie, at first reluctantly, continued to preach after this impressive response. As Sechler writes, \\"At the Marceline Institute she was asked to go on with a meeting since so many young people were interested. She told them she could not as her sermons were used and she had no more ready. The old Elder there told her that people were interested who had never been interested before, and that if she left their blood would be on her soul. She thought it over and stayed. That was the first regular meeting.\\" So that she could baptize people, she was ordained on March 17, 1892 in Marceline by J.S. Clemments (a general evangelist for the American Missionary Society). One year later, she was married to James Rawser Crank, with whom she later had four children. The Cranks received pressure for Sadie to retire from preaching after marriage. There were also offers for her to serve churches in the cities. She remained a preacher in rural Illinois and served on the Christian Woman's Board of Missions. Together with her husband, an evangelist, Crank helped organize and build numerous churches throughout Illinois and Missouri. During her lifetime, she baptized thousands of people and officiated many weddings and funerals. See also * Sarah Bostick  References   Further reading  * Aten, R. B. (1967). She Kept Men Standing.

He was the Managing Director of Ghana Post, the national postal service, until February 2017 when he was removed following accusations by Ghana Post employees of embezzlement and unethical behavior. Career Yao was appointed as Managing Director of Ghana Post in August 2015. During his tenure the service continued to suffer a steep fall in stamp revenue and lost money, falling short of the GH¬¢2 million needed every month in 2016 to meet the payroll. To find revenue growth outside of traditional postal service, he explored a number of ventures with private enterprises. This included a plan announced in 2016 to establish a microfinance company that was to mature into a commercial bank. Other plans included entering into the business segments of haulage and logistics and real estate business. Yao was especially keen to develop businesses ICT and e-commerce. Part of the turnaround strategy under Yao was to leverage the property owned by the service in the country's main cities to gain additional revenue through side lines. In Accra and Kumasi the Ghana Post entered into partnerships with private companies to start new business ventures. This meant clearing lands owned by Ghana Post by evicting squatters. In an October 2015 media tour, Yao showed the media efforts to clear lands owned by Ghana Post in Bubuashie of \\"mechanical shops, cattle farms, football parks, churches, and other unauthorised activities and structures\\" through a demolition exercise. During his last year as Managing Directory, Yao faced a lack of public confidence in the quality of the service delivered by Ghana Post and allegations that service had ceased. Yao countered these criticisms in an August 2016 public event aimed at promoting the launch of \\"Peaceful Elections\\" stamps ahead of the general election in 2016, stating, \\"Ghana Post is very much alive contrary to some perceptions out there that we no longer exist.\\" Embezzlement accusations On January 26, 2017, employees of Ghana Post publicly protested against the current management, leveling accusations of embezzlement. Some of the Ghana Post employees accused Yao of colluding with Head of ICT, Godfred Aboagye, and director of finance and administration, Solomon Agyeito, to embezzle funds. Aboagye was removed from his job and put under investigation for embezzlement. In an interview with employees, TV3 Ghana reported employees suspected that \\"outrageous\\" amounts paid to purchase two blade servers for a maintenance program had been embezzled by Yao, Aboagye, and Agyeito. The employees in the same interview also alleged that Yao and his deputy Agyeito had purchased cars, a 4-wheel drive and a saloon car, for themselves using the service's money without going through standard procurement channels. On investigating the allegations, TV3 Ghana reported that employees operating at Ghana Post's transportation office stated there were no procurement documents for the cars purchased by Yao and his deputy. In the following month the newly elected Government of Ghana removed Yao from his post and appointed James Y. A. Kwofie as the Acting Managing Director effective February 22, 2017. All existing heads of public institutions were removed by the new government, and Yao was also affected. Exoneration In a letter written by the new management of Ghana Post dated 16 November 2018 and signed by its new Managing Director, James Kwofie, the company said: \\"The Management of Ghana Ghana Post, Ghana's designated postal operator without prejudice wishes to bring to the attention of \\"whom it may concern\\" that Mr. Eric Yao who worked as the Managing Director of Ghana Post from 3 August 2015 to 22 February 2017, left office without any proven record of misconduct.

Biography  Coming from a modest family, Gaston Blanquart began studying the flute at the √âcole nationale de Valenciennes. In 1894 he succeeded the competition of entrance to the Conservatoire de Paris. His teacher Paul Taffanel considered him a model pupil. On July 28, 1898, he went through a jury presided over by Theodore Dubois, including Gabriel Faur√©, Gabriel Piern√© and Charles-Marie Widor; he then won the First PrizeDipl√¥me du Premier prix de fl√ªte de Gaston Blanquart with the famous Fantaisie (Op. 79) by Faur√© composed for the occasion. In 1900 he was hired by √âdouard Colonne as fourth flute, and in 1905 became a solo flute of the Concerts Colonne, he held this post for 35 years. The creations in which Gaston Blanquart participated are numerous and of primary importance: Maurice Ravel: Une barque sur l‚Äôoc√©an (1907) and the Rhapsodie espagnole (1908), Claude Debussy: Danses for harp (1904), Vincent D‚ÄôIndy: Jour d‚Äô√©t√© √† la montagne (1906) etc. The greatest soloists performed with the orchestra: Raoul Pugno, Pablo de Sarasate, Alfred Cortot, Pablo Casals, Jacques Thibaud. Occasional conductors were Arthur Nikisch, Richard Strauss, Claude Debussy, Gustav Mahler who directed his second symphony in 1910. Very regularly Gaston Blanquart performed as a soloist. He met a huge success in the Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune by Claude Debussy.\\"He made a name for himself in the Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune where his only presence ensured the concert a full house.\\" Claude Dorgeuille, L'√©cole fran√ßaise de fl√ªte, 1860-1950, √âditions Coderg, 1983, (p. 127) He married in 1900 with the cellist Fernande Dauphin. The couple had two children: Edmond and Marcelle future harpist, soloist of the Concerts Poulet and Concerts Colonne but also future mother of Arlette Sweetman. A friend of many great soloists and composers - we know that Camille Saint-Sa√´ns appreciated him very much and that he was the favorite flautist of Maurice Ravel - he very often played with partners such as Nadia Boulanger, Pablo Casals, Georges Enesco, Lily Laskine, Jacques Thibaud among many others. left A great friend of Pierre Monteux, the latter engaged him in the orchestra of the Ballets Russes which he directed. He participated in several very important premieres by Igor Stravinsky: Petrushka in June 1911 at the Ch√¢telet, The Nightingale in May 1914 and The Rite of Spring given at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es 29 May 1913. It was the occasion of one of the most enormous chahuts of all time but also a cultural shock that was to radically transform the vision of the future of intellectuals and artists. He had long dreamed of being part of the Op√©ra Orchestra, where he was appointed in 1923. In December 1927, he participated in the Salle Pleyel to the sole performance of Pierrot lunaire by Arnold Sch√∂nberg directed in France by the composer.http://www.flutepage.de/deutsch/composer/person.php?id=1330 Gaston Blanquart had a passion for pedagogy and had many pupils throughout his life, both in private and at the Schola Cantorum de Paris and at the Institut Berlioz. He welcomed many amateurs, including teachers Alexandre Minkowski and Louis Leprince-Ringuet. The atmosphere was very special rue de Miromesnil:Alexandre Minkowski, Jean Lacouture Le mandarin aux pieds nus, √âditions du Seuil, 1975, (p. 93-94) Father, mother and daughter gave all three lessons all day long. At the time of retirement, the last show in which Gaston Blanquart participated was the Faust by Charles Gounod where the role of Marguerite was held by a twenty-five year young debutante: Victoria de Los Angeles. In November 1953, he was promoted to the rank of Chevalier of the Legion d'honneur. Maurice Lehmann, director of the Opera, handed him his Cross.Genehisto.com All of his life he would help the most fragile. During the First World War he was taken prisoner at the very outset of hostilities and was interned at the Minden camp in Westphalia. He spent four years with twelve thousand other prisoners, and showed them an altruism uncommon in such circumstances. \\"It seemed that Gaston Blanquart imposed on all by his art, his calm reflection and also by a sort of kindness which was emanating from his personality. Unfortunately, there were not many men like him,\\" wrote Maurice Carton, one of his companions in captivity. Blanquart was very involved in associative life and social action, he helped young musicians as well as the elder ones. In November 1962 he suffered a malaise, he oscillated several days between life and death. He died in his sleep on 1 December 1962.

It is only known from the eastern edge of the New England Tableland. Description Styphelia perileuca is a spreading shrub which grows up to tall and wide. Its leaves are mostly broadly elliptic in shape, long, wide, slightly dished with very fine teeth along the edge and a sharp point on the tip. The flowers are tube- shaped, yellowish green in colour with fine red stripes and hang singly from upper leaf axils. There are five glabrous sepals long. The five petals are joined, forming a tube long with the tips of the petals rolled back and hairy on the inside surface. The stamens are straight and extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs mostly between September and January but flowers are also present in April.Styphelia perileuca growing in Cathedral Rock National Park Taxonomy and naming Styphelia perileuca was first formally described in 1992 by Jocelyn Powell and published in Telopea. The specific epithet (perileuca) is derived from the Ancient Greek words peri meaning \\"around\\" and leukos meaning \\"white\\" referring to the thin white perimeter of the leaves.

In the Withdrawal Agreement, it is officially referred to as the \\"financial settlement\\". The UK Office for Budget Responsibility's estimate of the financial settlement when the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 was ¬£32.9 billion. Since 31 January, the UK is in a transition period, and continues to contribute to the EU as if it were a member until the end of the transition period, reducing the amount of the financial settlement. The UK and EU began negotiations with differing perspectives on the basis for the bill. The UK side saw it as payment for preferential access to the European Single Market whereas the EU saw it as obligations previously agreed to funding the budget round ending 2020 and for its share of longer-range commitments. In December 2017, the negotiators reached agreement on the scope of these commitments and the methods for their valuation. History of the negotiations During the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Vote Leave claimed that the UK was sending ¬£350 million to the EU every week (the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated the true net figure as being about half this.). Following the referendum, the UK signalled that it may consider paying the EU to attain preferential access to the European Single Market and may offer to pay liabilities on a moral and co-operative basis, even if not legally obliged to do so, to secure a preferential working relationship with the EU. In Prime Minister Theresa May's speech on 17 January 2017 setting out the UK's plans to negotiate Brexit, she stated: > \\"And because we will no longer be members of the single market, we will not > be required to contribute huge sums to the EU budget. There may be some > specific European programmes in which we might want to participate. If so, > and this will be for us to decide, it is reasonable that we should make an > appropriate contribution. But the principle is clear: the days of Britain > making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end.\\" Despite the claim, ministers and officials, including Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union David Davis, had already indicated that some kind of payment to the EU might have to be part of a future trade deal and the House of Lords were told in January 2017 that the UK may have to contribute to the EU's budget after Brexit because of previous obligations entered into, unless a deal is done. The leaders of France and Germany both stated that the UK would need to agree to terms regarding departure, including in relation to a divorce bill, before discussing future relationships. This was reinforced by EU27 guidelines issued to the remaining 27 countries. Estimates of over ¬£50 billion appeared for a divorce bill and there were concerns raised about whether, and how much, the UK would owe the EU and that such a dispute could lead to an early end to negotiations, with the UK leaving the EU without a deal. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox claimed it would be ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù for the UK to pay a large sum and Conservative Party MP John Redwood said there was no legal basis to the demands. = House of Lords report = A 4 March 2017 report of the European Union Committee of the House of Lords acknowledged that the EU may claim for (1) part of the current budget (which runs from 2014 to 2020) post March 2019, because it was approved by the UK (2) part of the EU future commitments which amount to ‚Ç¨200 billion and (3) a contribution if the UK is to continue with access to some EU programmes. The report concluded that the UK had no legal obligation to make \\"exit\\" payments to the EU if there was no post-Brexit deal. =Trigger of Article 50= Theresa May's letter of 29 March 2017 to President of the European Council Donald Tusk triggering Article 50 noted that she wanted \\"fair settlement of the UK‚Äôs rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom‚Äôs continuing partnership with the EU\\". On 29 April 2017, the EU27 heads of state unanimously accepted negotiating guidelines prepared by Donald Tusk. The guidelines take the view that Article 50 permits a two-phased negotiation, whereby the UK first needs to agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, before the EU27 will entertain negotiations on a future relationship. The Prime Minister insisted to President of the European Commission Jean- Claude Juncker that talks about the future UK-EU relationship should start early and that Britain did not owe any money to the EU under the current treaties. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson claimed that the amounts being discussed were extortionate and said that European leaders can 'go whistle' over the EU divorce bill. = EU position paper = In June 2017, the EU drafted a 11-page position paper setting out the essential principles for a financial settlement and the methodology for calculating the obligation. Two different legal approaches arose in determining the financial element of the Brexit withdrawal agreement and (at least initially) the UK and EU negotiators differed on which would be the more appropriate. David Davis said that the \\"UK wants to go through the Brexit bill line-by-line to work out what it owes the EU.\\" In September 2017, the European negotiator Michel Barnier, in an address to the Italian parliament noted that despite progress in each topic of the Withdrawal Agreement negotiations, major issues were remaining in each topic, including for the financial settlement, for which his goal was that: * ¬´ All that is necessary in this negotiation is that everyone honors the commitments that they have made to each other. To settle the accounts. No more, no less.¬ª * ¬´ To settle the accounts in an objective manner, on the basis of all commitments made at 28.¬ª * ¬´ (...) to provide ‚Äì and (...) must provide ‚Äì certainty for project managers working in Europe, such as in Italy and its regions, and in other continents, such as Africa, on the basis of the commitment of the 28.¬ª * ¬´But beyond money, this is a question of trust between the 27 and the United Kingdom, based on the respect of one's signature. And everyone knows that we will need this trust to create a solid relationship in the future.¬ª. =UK assets= In 2017, the UK had a 16% share in the European Investment Bank (EIB) worth ¬£8.8bn based on data submitted by Lawyers for Britain. As part of the financial settlement, the UK's liability resulting from the guarantee for the financing made by the EIB while the UK was a Member State is to be maintained and its level decreased in line with the amortisation of the EIB portfolio outstanding at the time of UK's withdrawal, at the end of which the paid-in capital of the United Kingdom in the EIB will be reimbursed to the UK. In March 2018, the OBR estimated the net asset to offset the overall financial settlement at ‚Ç¨3.5bn. The Bank of England (BoE) has invested in the European Central Bank (ECB) amounting to 14.3374% of its paid up capital, equating to ‚Ç¨58.2 million at 1 January 2019. The BoE does not participate in any profits (or losses) of the ECB. The BoE has also made loans to the ECB. The ECB set up the European Financial Stability Facility in 2010, which has a borrowing facility of ‚Ç¨440bn and in addition used a guarantee from the European Commission and the EU Budget as collateral to borrow a further ‚Ç¨60bn. The paid-in capital of the UK in the ECB will be reimbursed to the BoE. The UK benefits from a rebate which reduces its contribution to the EU budget. The rebate is paid a year in arrears, accordingly the 2019 rebate would be payable in 2020. The EU has considerable assets including buildings, equipment and financial instruments, and there is a potential claim by the UK for a portion of these assets. Boris Johnson, the UK's Foreign Secretary, commenting on the Brexit \\"divorce bill\\" in May 2017 stated that the valuable EU assets the UK has paid for over the years should be properly valued, and that there were good arguments for including them in the negotiations. =Agreement on scope of commitments and methods for valuation= On 11 December 2017, Theresa May confirmed that the UK and the EU had agreed ‚Äúthe scope of commitments, and methods for valuations and adjustments to those values.‚Äù The UK's obligation is to be fixed as a percentage of the EU's obligations calculated at the date of withdrawal in accordance with a methodology agreed in the first phase of the negotiations. The amount due is complex to be calculated and includes various liabilities apart from just the core EU budget. The UK is also entitled to a portion of EU assets. In March 2018, the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) published the UK's economic and fiscal outlook including details of the estimated financial settlement as at 29 March 2019, the original date that the UK was to leave the EU, which it estimated at ¬£37.1 billion (‚Ç¨41.4 billion). The estimated settlement was made up of: * ¬£16.4bn (‚Ç¨18.5bn) towards the UK‚Äôs contribution to the EU budget to December 2020 (after offsetting for the UK rebate); * ¬£18.2bn (‚Ç¨20.2bn) towards outstanding commitments for projects that have been signed off but not yet paid for by 2020 (The Reste √† Liquider (\\"RAL\\") from successive Multiannual Financial Frameworks) to be paid up to 2028; and * ¬£2.5bn (‚Ç¨2.7bn) for other financial liabilities, being an estimate for pension liabilities of ‚Ç¨9.5bn offset by other assets totalling ‚Ç¨6.8bn. The payments towards the pension liabilities are estimated to be made until 2064. The UK would continue to benefit from all programmes as before the withdrawal until their closure under the condition that it respects the applicable EU legal rules. While serving as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab said in September 2018 the UK will not pay the financial settlement to the EU in a no-deal scenario. =Article 50 extensions= As the UK did not leave the EU on 29 March 2019, the UK continued to contribute to the EU as a member. Article 50 was extended until 31 October 2019 and the UK's contributions for the period from 30 March to 31 October 2019 were ¬£5 billion, leaving an estimated ¬£32.8 billion (‚Ç¨36.3 billion) remaining to be settled at 31 October 2019. Article 50 was further extended to 31 January 2020 and despite additional contributions to January 2020 and favourable currency fluctuations reducing the amount payable in sterling, an increase in pension liabilities of ¬£2.6 billion saw the estimate of the financial settlement at 31 January 2020, the date the UK left the EU, increase to ¬£32.9 billion. The financial settlement was not binding until the UK Parliament approved the Withdrawal Agreement, which was approved on 24 January 2020. =Transition period= Following approval of the Withdrawal Agreement, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and entered a transition period, but continues to contribute to the EU as if it were a member. The transition period is due to end on 31 December 2020 and based on the scheduled payments to 31 December 2020, the amount outstanding at that date will be the Reste √† Liquider (RAL) plus the other financial liabilities. The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill 2019‚Äì20 authorises HM Treasury to make scheduled payments up to March 2021. After December 2020, payments will accrue twice a year. =Future negotiations= On 7 September 2018 it was announced that Barnier had made a concession to British MPs and that the EU will allow a future trade agreement to be linked to the payment of the divorce bill. The EU Commission had long insisted that any trade agreement between the EU and Britain could not be linked to payment of financial settlements.

Gameplay The Darksiders games feature an action role-playing hack and slash style of gameplay. Players take control of one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, from a third-person perspective, each of which offer unique play styles and equipment. In the first game, War's method of fighting is using a two-handed signature sword named Chaoseater, though throughout the game the player can equip various other items including a Scythe and a revolver. In Darksiders II, Death uses two scythes as his signature weapon, and in Darksiders III, Fury uses a whip and magic to tear down her enemies. General gameplay among the games are similar, with players having an open world to explore, having to solve various puzzles to help them progress. Players can find chests which contain souls of the dead which they can use to buy various items and upgrades. The game has an emphasis on boss fights, where players need to learn their weak point in order to do vast amounts of damage. Players can also explore the open world by using the protagonists' own horses, War's being named Ruin, Death's being named Despair and Fury's being named Rampage. Related media Darksiders creator Joe Madureira expressed interest in a possible comic book series and film adaptation for the series. Madureira had been reportedly working on a screenplay, which he intended to sell its rights to a Hollywood studio. A prequel novel set before the events of Darksiders and Darksiders II titled Darksiders: The Abomination Vault was released in 2012. It was followed by a digital-first prequel comic series, titled Darksiders II: Death's Door, later the same year.

The library opened in 1890 and currently operates as a self- service library, with limited staff, as a result of cuts to funding. The building is home to Lambeth Archives, which remains open to users. History The Minet Library was built by William Minet and opened in 1890. Minet was a descendant of French Huguenots who immigrated to London in the 1700s, and 1889 he also gave 14¬Ω acres of land to the London County Council to create Myatt's Fields Park. The library was designed to be a church hall for St. James The Apostle on Knatchbull Road and to be used by the tenants of the local estate. When Minet's first wife, Alice Evans, died in 1887 before the building was completed, he decided to turn it into a public library in her memory. The library might have been completed before the nearby Durning Library and South Lambeth Tate Library, but was interrupted when the contractor went bankrupt, Minet was interested in the co-operative movement and decided to form a private company on co-operative lines. The experiment was successful and the library, which was designed by George Hubbard who also designed nearby Longfield Hall, was finished and opened in 1890. Hubbard's octagonal library building, in the Gothic Revival style, was partially destroyed by an incendiary bomb on 8 December 1940 during The Blitz. The fire destroyed 18,585 books. Around 6,700 books were salvaged, and half of those were moved to Longfield Hall were a temporary library was established. The Surrey Collection, a collection of archive records established by William Minet, survived the fire because they were housed in a strong room. Minet Library around 1890 The library was rebuilt in 1956 and became part of the London Borough of Lambeth public library service and official home of the Lambeth Archives. The closure of Minet Library In the late 1990s, the library began to suffer from cuts to local council funding, and Lambeth Council proposed closing the library on a number of occasions. This culminated in 2015 with Lambeth Council closing the library (but not the archive) and proposing to contract Greenwich Leisure Limited (GLL) to convert part of the building into a gym, with a limited library service continuing to operate. The magazine Private Eye reported in May 2017 that Lambeth Council had begun talking to GLL about contracting them to turn Minet Library and others in the borough into gyms before a plan by library staff and local residents to save the libraries was rejected in 2015. In May 2016, despite protests by local residents, the Minet Library was closed by the Lambeth Council. The library reopened in 2017, but with reduced services. It is currently operating as a self-service library. Lambeth Archives and the local history reference collection remains open to the public until a new home can be found.

It is registered as a protected ensemble in the Bavarian protected monument list.  Location  The street is located on the eastern edge of Munich's Lehel district. It runs along the River Isar from Maximilians Bridge to Max- Joseph Bridge. To the east of Widenmayerstra√üe is the Isarpromenade with the Isar quays.  History  Construction of the bank fortification of the Isar on the Widenmayerstra√üe around 1893 Before 1890 there were only two buildings on the road running along the Isar, which was then called the √Ñu√üere Isarstra√üe. These were the No. 11, a three-storey wooden house built in 1877, and No. 15, the Hanfstaengl Villa, built in 1888. Both buildings were destroyed during World War II. At approximately the same time as quay walls were built at the Isar, around 1893/94, the further development of the road took place, which in 1896, was named after Johannes von Widenmayer, the mayor of Munich, who died in 1893. The Innere Isarstra√üe running parallel to the Hofhammerschmiedbach was abandoned and became part of the building plots, the brook itself was overgrown and partially overbuilt. The development was predominantly from south to north, initially in the style of late historicism, then baroque and classical. Until 1899, the two most southerly building blocks had been completed. In 1900, the northernmost house (No. 52) was erected on the corner of Tivolistra√üe, which only 12 years later got a southern neighbor. As the only house between Widenmayerstra√üe and Isar, the gymnasium of the gymnastic and sports club TS Jahn M√ºnchen was established in 1904. After World War II, it remained as a ruin and was only demolished in 1962/63 for the planned widening of the road. In addition to houses no. 10 (1902) and 12 (1905/06), the building was not continued until 1909. In 1911-12, the unitary assembly No. 46-51, was set back from the escape line of the other buildings and erected against them. Most of the buildings were erected at the beginning of World War I, but the last vacancy (No. 17) was only completed in 1986. The damage caused by World War II varied: some houses were only slightly damaged, others could be repaired, others had to be demolished. The new buildings erected there were optimally adapted to the surrounding environment.  Description  The Widenmayerstra√üe is only built on its western side. The buildings are consecutively numbered so that on this side there are both even as well as odd house numbers. The developments are typically four to five- storey. The Isarpromenade east of the road is lined with two tree rows like an alley. A bicycle path runs between the Isarpromenade and the road, and parking lots are located on both sides of the two-lane road.  Highlighted buildings  Widenmayerstra√üe 6 Particularly prominent are some corner buildings, e.g. Through a round pavilion or a tower attachment on the road corner. Many buildings in Widenmayerstra√üe are also listed as individual monuments under monument protection: houses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, 23, 25 / 25a, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46a, 46 Steps I, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 and 52. The houses with the numbers 46 to 52 are located at the wider northern end of the road and form a single assembly, the backside of which is located on the Eisbach. The buildings with the house numbers 3 (2007), 10 (2003), 16 (1999), 23 (2007) and 28 were awarded the facade award of the state capital Munich. The building with the house number 9 received a praiseworthy mention as a building in public sponsorship (2005).  Traffic  The Widenmayerstra√üe is part of the Isarparallele, which forms a cross-link from the north (Kennedybr√ºcke) to the south (Bruderm√ºhlbr√ºcke) within the Mittlerer Ring and from there further south to the district of Thalkirchen where it leads to the Bundesstra√üe 11. Over a large part, the Widenmayerstra√üe is a one-way street from the south to the north. The parallel road from Emil- Riedel-Stra√üe, Oettingenstra√üe and Sternstra√üe is used by the traffic from north to south. Only the northern part, on which the underpass begins under the Tivolistra√üe, is navigable in both directions.

In addition to his own career as an artist, Vernon was also a longtime friend of Merle Haggard and a member of the Strangers. As a child, Vernon was inspired by his older brother Roy, who hosted a country music radio show in Jackson, Tennessee. It was not uncommon for touring artists to drop in at the Vernon's home, often playing impromptu sessions in the house or yard. During the late 1950s, Vernon began performing and writing songs as a regional act. Vernon later relocated to California during the early 1960s, where he honed his craft as a professional performer and bandleader. Vernon's primary band on the West Coast was called The Boondockers. Vernon met Merle Haggard during the early 1960s and the two developed a close friendship. Vernon performed as a member of Haggard's band, The Strangers until Haggard retired from performing in early 2016, due to illness. In addition to touring and performing as a solo artist, Vernon recorded albums and singles for Capitol Records, Epic and Chart label. He was paired with a young female singer named Lawanda Lindsey, who was a protege of Buck Owens. Vernon and Lindsey released a number of duets, both as singles and albums. Vernon also participated in the country rock scene, recording an album in 1967 entitled Loversville, with members of The Flying Burrito Brothers and The Byrds. Vernon received an endorsement from Fender, with the Fender Telecaster, Fender Stratocaster and Fender Coronado models as his primary choice for electric guitars. In 1968, Vernon also endorsed a banjo made by Fender, which he often included in his live sets. During the mid-1960s, Vernon and his band played a resident gig at the Golden Nugget, which lasted nearly fifteen years. In between these performances in Las Vegas, Vernon continued to record new material and frequently traveled with his band to perform in other cities. After his residency gig ended, Vernon relocated to New Mexico, where he focused on private business ventures and performing tour dates with The Strangers. On October 9, 2003, Vernon performed with Merle Haggard and The Strangers on Late Show with David Letterman. As a member of The Strangers, Vernon played rhythm guitar and contributed background vocals on the live album Willie Merle & Ray: Big Hits Live From The Last Of The Breed Tour, which was released on CD and DVD in 2009. This revue tour was in support of the 2007 collaborative album Last of the Breed and featured Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson and Ray Price with Ray Benson and Asleep at the Wheel. Vernon is seen onstage contributing background vocals and playing his red Fender Telecaster standing next to Theresa Haggard on stage left. In 2015, the song \\"Sweet Jesus,\\" was recorded by The Oak Ridge Boys. Vernon co-wrote the song with Merle Haggard and it won the GMA Dove Awards for Country Song of the Year. The studio recording of this song appears on The Oak Ridge Boys' studio album, Rock of Ages, Hymns and Gospel Favorites. Today, Vernon tours with The Kenny Vernon & Friends Classic Country Tour, performing concerts throughout North America and in parts of Europe, where classic country music remains popular. Recently, Vernon has appeared in Branson and is also a guest performer on the RFD-TV cable television Network. Kenny has relocated to his original town in West Tennessee, Jackson.

It is a strategy to change the process of policy design, implementation and evaluation by taking into consideration the gender specific and often diverse needs, priorities, interests and values of differently positioned men and women.True, J. 2003. Mainstreaming Gender in Global Public Policy. International Feminist Journal of Politics, Vol. 5, No. 3, pp. 368‚Äì396. In this context, gender mainstreaming is about awareness of the existence of gender disparities and their causes and implications, and ensures that they are addressed at each phase of the policy cycle or policy analyses and revision.  Context and process  There are two situations in which Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs) can find themselves. One is that they may not have a policy at all, and the other is that they might have a policy but that the policy may not have addressed gender issues or mainstreamed gender. In the first instance, TEIs need to develop a gender- responsive policy for their institutions, and in the second they need to review their policy from gender perspectives. In this part of the module we will look at mainstreaming gender in the different phases of the policy cycle: Problem Definition, Agenda Setting, Policy Formulation, Policy Legitimation and Policy Evaluation. = Problem definition = Share of women in the teaching force, by region, income group and education level, 2017 Problem definition explains the nature, scope and significance of the problem within the context of the current policy environment (international, regional and national legal and policy commitments). During this stage, a problem is identified and examined, and possible solutions are explored through research and discussion. It requires that the delineation of the policy problem is as clear as possible in order to help identify problems of teacher education, as well as gender issues that are relevant at the national level and that can be addressed by formulating policy in their applicable institutions. Whatever the problem identified, the TEI must be seen from the perspective of gender equality. In order to do this, the first step is to investigate gender disparities in different areas and levels among students, teaching staff and administration. In this regard, some of the following areas are analyzed: * Number of male and female teaching staff * Number of male and female teaching staff by qualification * Number of male and female staff holding key administrative positions * Number of male and female trainees * Number of male and female trainees by academic performance = Agenda setting = Once a problem is identified, a decision has to be reached as to whether it requires a policy intervention. If so, efforts will be made to bring the matter and its possible solutions to the attention of relevant staff and decision-makers to make it a policy-requiring issue. Already existing policies, strategies, programmes or offices may address some of the problems. The institute may need to review the policies, programmes or office structures, and also introduce a gender equality perspective to strengthen them further and address the problems more effectively. If there are gender-responsive policies available, TEIs may need to come up with a more concrete implementation plan, while other problems may require a policy initiative. In such a situation, the problem could be presented as a policy agenda to the relevant authority for consideration. = Defining goals and outputs = After defining the problem, and once the problem is considered as requiring policy intervention, goals are identified in order to address the problem. In the context of TEIs, the goals could range from increasing enrolment, addressing quality, acquiring resources, and mitigating high staff turnover to narrowing gender disparities. Policy goals need to state gender concerns specifically and visibly. Different performance indicators and sex-disaggregated data need to be considered to capture the gender dimensions. The stated goals need to take into consideration the different gender related barriers women and men face to benefit equally and equitably.Status of Women Canada. 1998. Gender-based analysis. A guide for policy-making. Ottawa, Status of Women Canada. http://www.paci cwater.org/user les/ le/IWRM/Toolboxes/gender/gender_based_analysis. pdf (Accessed 3 July 2014.) = Policy formulation = Policy formulation has two basic stages: determining the policy options and selecting the preferred option. This process may involve debate over alternative policy choices, which takes into account both the benefits and costs of each policy option. The policy alternatives are derived from a research process that investigates the problem in an in-depth manner using either primary or secondary sources of data or both. In collecting information all data, all relevant individuals and organizations have to be consulted, and all numerical data have to be disaggregated by sex. This stage may also entail analysis of existing policies. Based on the information gathered, the preferred policy options are presented, which will enable the policy objective to be effectively and efficiently reached. = Policy legitimation = For a policy to obtain a legal status, it has to be approved as an official policy document by relevant authorities in the TEI, as well as the ministry or relevant divisions within the ministry, depending on the structures and the practices of that specific country. This is an important step as it gives the policy legitimacy. Once it is approved, a policy also serves as an advocacy instrument, as well as a document that could be used to raise funds. = Policy implementation = Implementation refers to the actual practical activities that need to be carried out to realize the policy goals and objectives. A number of critical decisions are made at this stage: decisions about regulations, structures, budget and partnerships, all of which are necessary to implement the policy. Policy implementation requires a commitment. As observed from experience, many countries and organizations have very good policy instruments, but most of the time they remain on paper. After going through the process of policy development, which is very resource intensive, its implementation requires serious consideration. The first inquiry should determine the changes needed to implement the policy. = Policy evaluation = Evaluation is monitoring and assessing the process and impact of policy implementation. Policy research and analysis are used as strategies to evaluate whether the policy goals were reached, and if there were any unanticipated positive or negative outcomes. The evaluation process also attempts to see the various types of impacts: direct versus indirect, and short term versus long term. The information gathered from the evaluation will be used as inputs in the next policy cycle or process. Policy monitoring and evaluation is usually a challenging step as it requires consistent follow up, information collection, and efforts to compare policy goals with the outcome of activities carried out to implement the policy. The policy goals serve as a framework for any instrument that is designed to collect and compile information for the evaluation. The instruments that are designed should ensure that gender is included as a category of analysis and that issues concerning both men and women are included in the questions. Specific women's issues, as identified in the policy problem, should be covered, and during the data collection process both men and women should be included as sources of data. In the context of TEIs the data to be gathered on enrolment, performance and achievement, in-service training, promotion, leadership and administration are to be disaggregated by sex.

When news of the Hatfields' preparations for war reached the McCoy side, the Hatfields were already en route to invade the McCoy territory, so Frank Phillips, the leader of the McCoy posse, rounded up every able man he could and led his posse to intercept the invading Hatfields.

One group of the McCoy side managed to lure the Hatfields into one area of the battlefield while another group of McCoys moved to outflank them, which caused the Hatfields to suffer multiple casualties and made them retreat. A number of Hatfields did not manage to escape and were taken prisoner by the McCoys. Aftermath As a result of the battle some members of the Hatfield side were taken prisoner. These prisoners alongside those from prior to the battle were put on trial with the permission of the Kentucky government for the various crimes they had committed during the feud, mainly the murder of the Randall McCoy's sons for killing Ellison Hatfield and the killing of one of his daughters during the New Year's Eve massacre.

The distillery has been operating since 2002, and was founded by the d‚ÄôOffay brothers, Richard and Bernard d‚ÄôOffay. It is the first and only commercial rum producer and exporter in the Seychelles. History Rum was first introduced to the Seychelles in the mid 16th century by the British Navy. Only from the late 1800s to the early 1900s was sugar cane cultivated on the islands ‚Äì primarily to supplement the supply of sugar from infrequent visits from ships. Only as the delivery of sugar to the islands became more frequent, did the use of sugar cane begin to evolve ‚Äì initially to making fermented cane juice known as ‚ÄòBaka‚Äô. Local residents also have a history of making their own rhum arrang√© ‚Äì a mixture of local rum and a blend of herbs and spices (usually a family recipe). This is traditionally served as a digestif (post-meal drink). The Trois Fr√®res Distillery was founded in 2002 and is located on an old tropical spice plantation site, La Plaine St Andr√©, which dates back to the 1700s. The d‚ÄôOffay family was granted a lease for the property, which is a national heritage site, and they restored it over a period of two and half years in order to set up the distillery. The name Takamaka refers to a local bay on the island and is the name of local tree which featured on the early labels of the rum. The Takamaka brand is now exported internationally to markets in Europe and the UAE. Production process Takamaka Rum is made from naturally grown local sugar cane from four different regions of Mah√© by a cooperative of three dozen local farmers. It is then crushed on site at the distillery. The sugar cane juice is fermented and distilled in temperature controlled stainless steel tanks. The distillation process takes place in three copper stills, two pot stills for flavour and a rectifying column for purity. Takamaka Rums are then aged and matured in French and American oak barrels before being blended with aged rums, local spices, fruit extracts, and spring water from the island.

Plot In a small seaside town lives Aleksei \\"The Greek\\" Grekov, a former katala - a slang term in the criminal circles meaning professional gambler. He is retired and now serves as a sailor on a pleasure boat of the semi-criminal businessman named Shota. Life goes on smoothly, but suddenly a terrible event occurs. Shota, having lost a lot of money to the criminal boss named \\"Director\\", tries to hide, the boat is burned right in the port, and Anna, Shota's girlfriend, is taken hostage by the bandits. Despite various efforts Shota falls into the hands of the criminals and they brutally kill him, but The Greek helps Anna and her young daughter escape to Moscow. Aleksei understands that while the Director does not receive all the debts of late Shota, he will go after Anna. And so The Greek who is in love with Anna decides to return to his former \\"craft\\" in order to \\"earn\\" money with a card game in order to save Anna. In Moscow, The Greek meets his longtime acquaintance, a criminal named \\"Crucian\\", and soon they begin to win money playing cards against underground businessmen, bandits and simply gullible citizens. The amount of money accumulated by Aleksei is growing, but The Greek clearly understands that only by obtaining a huge jackpot he can finish once and for all this sordid matter. Aleksei undertakes a suicidal risk. He secretly buys special lenses that allow him to see what cards others have and challenges the Director himself to a one-on-one match. The \\"big game\\" begins and the Director loses large sums to The Greek. Lola, the criminal boss's assistant, draws attention to a certain oddity: during the game Aleksei goes to the toilet every two hours allegedly to \\"freshen up\\".

The bandits uncover the Greek's ploy and severely punish Aleksei by turning him into a mutilated half- blind invalid. Returning to his hometown, The Greek begins to work again in the port. After meeting with Anna, he receives terrible news. It turns out that after the death of Shota, Anna hid all his money, deceiving both the bandits and Aleksei. Shaken by Anna's treachery, The Greek bids farewell to her forever. Soon Aleksei is summoned to the police, he gives evidence against the Director, and the bloody revenge of the bandits does not delay itself.

There are two types of curricula: formal and informal. Formal curricula are introduced by a government or an educational institution. Moreover they are defined as sets of objectives, content, resources and assessment. Informal curricula, also defined as hidden or unofficial, refer to attitudes, values, beliefs, assumptions, behaviours and undeclared agendas underlying the learning process. These are formulated by individuals, families, societies, religions, cultures and traditions. More particularly, gender inequality is apparent in the curriculum of both schools and Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs). Physical education (PE) is particularly delicate, as gender equality issues coming from preconceived stereotyping of boys and girls often arise. It is often believed that boys are better at physical exercise than girls and that these are better at 'home' activities including sewing and cooking. This belief prevails in many cultures around the world and is not bound to one culture only.  Curriculum language and gender  Some curricular objectives show that the language used is gender biased. Indeed, it can happen that the language itself can communicate the status of being male or female, and the status of being assertive or submissive. In many cultures, 'being male' is expressed in language as being confident. In Japan, according to Pavlenko,Norton, B. & Toohey, K. (eds). 2004. Critical Pedagogies and Language Learning. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. female Japanese learners are led 'to see English as a language of empowerment. The students state that ... the pronoun system of English allow[s] them to position and express themselves differently as more independent individuals than when speaking Japanese.' This example clearly shows how languages, reflecting cultures, are the basis for introducing gender inequalities highlighting the curricula.  Curriculum structure and gender  Many Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs) around the world, which set curricula, that is; teaching diplomas, show a worrying shortcoming regarding issues of gender equality. For instance, students who prove being prepared to become schoolteachers are taught on education theories, the psychology of learning, teaching methodologies and class management, among others and one or two practical courses. There is no highlight on gender equality-related issues in their training. Even courses on curriculum design ignore these issues. This omission is highly problematic and should be addressed by curriculum designers of TEIs. It is important that gender equality issues are part of the curriculum in order to help future teachers to be more sensitive about gender equality issues. Thus when they become teachers, they can become agents of change in their schools.  Content of instructional materials and gender  Several studies have shown that textbooks reinforce traditional views of masculinity and femininity and encourage children to accept a traditional gender order. For example, a recent study conducted by Kostas (2019) found that female characters in textbooks of primary education portrayed mainly as mothers and housewives whilst male characters were identified as breadwinners. Additionally, teachers often use materials, including texts, images or examples that reinforce stereotyped roles. Typical examples given include, roles of the father (reading the newspaper) and the mother (serving dinner); the doctor (male) and the nurse (female); playing ball (boy) and combing doll's hair (girl). By doing this, teachers are also promoting gender bias which favors girls as well. For instance, bullying and noise-making for boys and politeness and gentleness for girls. Gender bias does not only favor males over females; it can also go the other way around. They are both negative when considering a healthy relationship between the teacher and the learner.  A gender equal curriculum  A gender equal curriculum shows the diversity of society when increasing examples that highlight successful female characters in texts as well as in the examples used during classes. Instructional materials, including textbooks, handouts or workbooks, should be studied to determine whether they are gender biased, gender neutral or gender-sensitive/responsive. In Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs), curricula need to include elements that recognize gender equality-related issues in learning materials, and how those issues can be faced by teachers once they take up the profession and start to use these materials in their classes. Quality curriculum should include gender equality as a result of teaching and learning in TEIs, as well as in schools. Educational systems that adopt gender equality aspects are able to: * Revise its curriculum framework to explicitly state commitment to gender equality. * Emphasize attitudes and values that promote gender equality. * Ensure that the content of the course syllabus includes values and attitudes of gender equality. Revise textbooks and learning materials to become gender-sensitive. * Remove gender-based stereotypes that contribute towards perpetuating gender inequalities.  Approaches in preventing gender inequality and school-related gender-based violence  It is possible to integrate school-related gender- based violence (SRGBV) prevention into the curriculum for children of all school-going ages. Topics include comprehensive sexuality education (CSE), life skills education, civics education and targeted approaches on managing aggression, developing bystander skills, forming healthy relationships and protection from bullying ‚Äì these elements are often combined. = Examples =  The World Starts with Me, Uganda  In 2002, two Dutch NGOs including the World Population Foundation and Butterfly Works, created The World Starts with me. Aimed at students aged 12 ‚Äì 19 years old, it is a low-tech, online, interactive sex education programme. The programme uses David and Rose, two virtual peer educators who guide students through fourteen lessons around self-esteem, healthy relationships, sexual development, safer sex, gender equality and sexual rights. Each lesson includes an assignment-type lesson, for instance creating a storyboard, an art work or conducting a role play on the topic of that lesson. Evaluation of the programme (with the use of a quasi-experimental design) showed a significant positive effects on non- coercive sex within students in intervention groups. Indeed, they reported having more confidence in their ability to deal with situations where sexual pressure and force would be used.Rijsdijk, Liesbeth et al. 2011. The World Starts With Me: A multilevel evaluation of a comprehensive sex education programme targeting adolescents in Uganda. BMC Public Health, Vol. 11, p. 334.  Programs H and M, Brazil  Named after the Spanish and Portuguese words for men and women (hombres in Sp., homes in Port., mujeres in Sp., mulheres in Port.), the programs H and M used an evidence-based curriculum and included a group of educational activities which were designed to be carried out in same-sex group settings, as well as by same-sex facilitators of the groups, who can eventually be consider as gender-equitable role models.Care International. 2012. The Young Men Initiative: Engaging young men in the Western Balkans in gender equality and violence prevention: A Case Study. Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Care International. The manuals used by these programmes include activities on fatherhood/motherhood and caregiving, violence prevention, sexual and reproductive health including HIV/AIDS and other related issues. The activities of the programme included brainstorming role-playing and other exercises which contributed to students reflecting on how boys and girls socialized and the pros and cons of this socialization and to explore the benefits of changing certain behaviours. The programme was evaluated in several locations through mostly quasi-experimental studies. It showed evidence of positive changes in participants' gender-equitable attitudes and behaviours and showed reduced gender-based violence.Ricardo, C., Nascimento, M., Fonseca, V. and Segundo, M. 2010.

Fourth R, Canada  This programme is based on the belief that relationship knowledge and skills can and should be taught in the same way as reading, writing and arithmetic, which gives the program its name. The programme is taught with children of grades 8 - 12. Thanks to a five-year randomized control trial of the classes with Grade 9 students (aged between 14 and 15), it was found that when comparing, students who received standard health classes students (especially boys) who received the Fourth R used significantly fewer acts of violence towards a dating partner by the end of Grade 11.Wolfe, D., Crooks, C., Jaffe, P., Chiodo, D., Hughes, R., Ellis, W., Stitt, L. and Donner, A. 2009.

Second Step, United States  This Second Step program teaches skills such as communication, coping and decision-making with the objective to help young people navigate peer pressure, substance abuse and in person and online bullying. The aforementioned programme has been used with more than 8 million students in over 32,000 American schools. A two- year cluster-randomized clinical trial of Second Step was carried out with over 3,600 students at 36 middle schools in Grades 6 and 7 (aged 11‚Äì13 years) in Illinois and Kansas. At the end of the programme, the study found that, students in Illinois intervention schools were 39 per cent less likely to report sexual violence perpetration and 56 per cent less likely to self-report homophobic name-calling victimization than students in control schools. There was, however, no significant difference in the Kansas schools.Espelage, D., Basile, K. and Hamburger, M. 2012. Bullying Perpetration and Subsequent Sexual Violence Perpetration among Middle School Students. Journal of Adolescent Health, Vol. 50, No. 1, pp. 60‚Äì65.  The Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS), India  The GEMS project used extracurricular activities, role- playing and games. This project began in the sixth grade and worked for two years with boys and girls between the ages of 12‚Äì14 in public schools in Goa, Kota and Mumbai. In Goa and Kota, it was layered with ongoing school curriculum. In Mumbai, it was run as an independent pilot project in 45 schools. An evaluation study was implemented on the pilot which using a quasi- experimental design to assess the results of the programme on the students. Over the course of the programme, the study found that participating students were more supportive of girls pursuing higher education and marrying later in life, and of boys and men contributing to household tasks. However, an important component of GEMS, students' behaviours and attitudes around reducing violence prooved mixed results. The GEMS approach will now be carried out in up to 250 schools in Mumbai, following the success of the first pilot programme. It is also being rolled out in 20 schools in Viet Nam.ICRW. 2011.

Flowering plants have a single flower 20‚Äì25 mm long and 7‚Äì9 mm wide borne on a flowering stem 150‚Äì250 mm high with between three and five stem leaves wrapped around the stem. The flowers are green, white and brown. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward and downward with a thread-like tip 5‚Äì15 mm long. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have an erect, thread-like tip 15‚Äì30 mm long and a broad V-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is 8‚Äì9 mm long, 3‚Äì4 mm wide, dark brown, blunt, and not visible in an intact flower. Flowering occurs from February to May. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis fischii was first formally described in 1950 by William Nicholls from a specimen collected near Woodside. The description was published in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (fischii) honours the Fisch family of Doncaster who discovered the species in 1949. Distribution and habitat Fisch's greenhood grows among grasses and low shrubs in woodland and forest, mainly in the highlands of New South Wales south from the New England National Park, less commonly in eastern Victoria and southern Queensland.

Residents of Odessa refer to the street as Kartamyshevskaya (), omitting the word \\"street\\". It is in postal code 65091. Formation and name The former Turkish fortress of Hadjibey and its surrounding settlements was renamed Odessa, and officially became a town in 1798. Settlers from elsewhere in Ukraine and Russia began to arrive in the new town and its adjacent settlements, Moldavanka and Peresyp. Kartamyshev was a noble family name in the Russian Empire which originated in the 17th century. In 1802, Ivan Kartamyshev and his family (including his son Bonifatiy Ivanovich Kartamyshev, born in 1790) moved from Kharkov to Moldavanka. The Kartamyshev family established a large farm, and their farmhouse was near the beginning of the area between today's Srednyaya and Komityetskaya Streets. After 1814, Moldavanka was mentioned as a suburb of Odessa. On 7 May 1823, Graf Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov was appointed governor-general of New Russia (as the southern provinces of the empire were then called) and namestnik of Bessarabia. The capital and largest city was Odessa. Bonifatiy Ivanovich Kartamyshev was appointed the ratmann and commissioner of Moldavanka by Vorontsov. Kartamyshev, a silk and paper merchant, also owned bookshops in the area. The three-block street was first drawn on Odessa's General Plan in 1835, although the streets were not named. Present-day Kartamyshevskaya Street is two blocks long. Early history (1835‚Äì1939) =1836‚Äì1850= Kartomyshevskaya Street was first mentioned in 1836. The first known architect of buildings on the street was N. N. Cherkunov, who built three houses between 1847 and 1850: * Present-day Golovkovskaya Street, 1 (at the corner of Kartamyshevskaya and Golovkovskaya Streets). The 1847 house, with a shed roof, was rebuilt in the mid-1950s with a flat roof. Its walls were lined with tile during the 1970s. * An 1848 house (now demolished) built for S. Brinzi at Kartanyshevskaya, 34 * An 1850 house (also demolished) built for Ye. Savenko at Kartanyshevskaya, 36 =1851‚Äì1889= Until 1870, Karamyshevskaya Street was primarily residential. During the second half of the 19th century, the street gradually took on an industrial character. In the early 1870s, a windmill at the corner of Komityetskaya and Kartamyshevskaya Streets (on the even-numbered side of Kartamyshevskaya Street) was replaced by a steam mill owned by Turkish consul Rafail Hawa. Hawa also established a small glassworks for the production of bottles and similar vessels on the street. The glassworks was sold to a hat manufacturer named Delpech in 1875. At the turn of the 20th century, two small glassworks (one owned by Wilhelm Sanzenbacher) existed on the street. =1890‚Äì1903= eclectic-style Kartamyshevskaya 14, owned by Meer M. Kanela in 1902 and 1903, in June 2017 On behalf of Ivan Solyanikov, Vassily Lobanov petitioned for the construction of a two-storey stone house at the corner of Karamyshevskaya and Kosvennaya Streets (Kartamyshevskaya Street, 11 and Kosvennaya Street, 76) in 1893; the plan was approved on 16 August of that year. The house's architect was named Ottone. In 1898, the property belonged to A. F.

Kartomyshevska Street was first named on the city map in 1894. A petroleum factory owned by a man named Lang existed on the street in the late 19th century, and a mining engineer named Yushkin was summoned from Grozny to work there. In 1898, two parcels were on the block between Kertamyshevska and Kosvyennaya Streets: * Karamyshevskaya, 10, from the corner to the present-day boundary between houses on Kartamyshevskaya street 12 and 14 (including Kartamyshevskaya, 14), owned by M. Posokhov * Karamyshevskaya, 8, from the corner of Kosvyennaya and Kartamyshevskaya Streets to the present-day boundary between Kartamyshevskaya 12 and 14, owned by H. Wolf and others The numbering of the even-numbered side of Kartamyshevskaya Street was changed in 1902 and 1903. =Revolutionary period (1904-1920)= Odessa gangster, revolutionary and military leader Mishka Yaponchik in the 1910s 1919 map of Odessa, including electric-train lines The Russian Empire experienced a revolutionary period between 1904 and 1920, and the Potemkin uprising brought Odessa into the revolutionary movement. From 1918 to February 1920, political power in Odessa changed a number of times until the Red Army installed the Bolsheviks in power. The houses on Kartamyshevska Street were: *Kartamyshervska Street, 16, at the corner of Kosvyennaya and Karamyshevska Streets. On 30 June 1904, a project was approved for V. N. Posokhova to rebuild one-story stone buildings into premises for people's baths, annex buildings for tanks and boilers, and a single-storey stone outbuilding on Kosvyennaya Street, 41. The project was approved on the same day. *Kartamyshevska Street, 14: In 1907 and 1908, the parcel was acquired by Abram Yankelevich Soskin. Odessa gangster Mishka Yaponchik and his gang were active from 1905 to 1907 and 1917 to 1919, and used a shed in the courtyard to descend underground and hide from the police. *Karamyshevskaya Street, 7: Owned by Khana Spivak, the house sheltered a group of revolutionary social democrats who plotted to blow up Russian ships. *Kartamyshevska street, 26: Purchased by Ivan Chernyavsky and his wife, Yelizaveta Chernyavskaya (n√©e Isakina) after their 1909 marriage. *Apartment house of Ivan Solyanikov: In 1913, the parcel had two owners: A. F. Solyanikova and P. M. Groodchenko. *Corner of Komityetskaya Street and the odd-numbered side of Karamyshevska Street: The Tarnopol brothers' third wallpaper factory replaced the Lang petroleum factory in 1911. The factory, which produced up to 280,000 rolls of wallpaper by 1913, was closed after the October Revolution. The numbering of the odd-numbered side of the street was changed in 1913. According to a 1910 Odessa map, the 10A electric-train line ran along Balkovkaya Street and crossed Kartomyshevska Street. According to 1912, 1916, 1917 and 1919 maps, two lines crossed Kartomyshevska: the 10A and the Kosvennaya Street line. =1920‚Äì1938= The Soviets entered Odessa on 7 February 1920. The next two years were a time of privation, with increased deaths of young children and the elderly. The wallpaper factory reopened as the Comintern factory in 1923 as the only wallpaper factory in the USSR. During its first year, the factory produced 575,000 rolls of wallpaper. In 1930, after modernization, it produced 6,000,000 rolls per year. Tapestry and wallpaper manufacturing in Ukraine began on Karamyshevska Street. The apartment house of Ivan Solyanikov at Karamyshevska 17 and Kosvennaya 86, designed by architect C. Ottone, was demolished during this period. Petrovsky Street (1939-1941) Grigory Petrovsky in 1937 In 1939, Kartamyshevska Street was renamed Petrovsky Street; it was known by local residents as Petrovskogo Street. The street was renamed in honor of Grigory Petrovsky, who often visited Odessa. =Defense of Odessa= The defense of Odessa, from 5 August to 16 October 1941, began when German and Romanian troops surrounded the city. Middle School 60 was blown up by Soviet troops in October 1941, before they left Odessa by sea to continue the siege of Sevastopol (1941‚Äì42). During the defense of the city Odessa's city hall was located at Karamyshevska Street, 10. Occupation and liberation Petrovsky Street returned to its original name during the German and Romanian occupation. Odessa was liberated by Soviet troops under General Rodion Malinovsky on 10 April 1944. The only significant damage to buildings on Kartamyshevska Street during the Second World War was the destruction of the school. Different names (1945‚Äì1953) 1946 map of a parcel at Petrovsky Street, 26, owned by Yelizavyeta Yakovlyevna Chernyavskaya Denationalization certificate of Kartamyshevskaya, 26, dated 9 September 1948 In 1945, Kartamyshevska Street was officially renamed Sukharev Street. According to a 13 April 1946 map of a parcel at Kartamyshevska 26, the street was still known as Petrovsky Street. A 9 September 1948 denationalization certificate lists the street as Kartamyshevska Street. During the fourth five-year plan (1946-1950), the Poligraphmach plant () was built on the odd-numbered side of Kartamyshevska Street between Komitetskaya and Kosvennaya Streets. Replacing the Tarnopol brothers' third wallpaper factory and others houses and shops, it produced polygraph machines. The two-storey, Soviet neoclassic house with columns and gates at Kartamyshevskaya 34 was built on the site of a sausage factory in 1952. From 1947 to 1970, housing was built primarily for military families. Radio jamming In 1947, the city government transferred 11 acres of land to the Black Sea Shipping Company for an antenna installation. The large antenna facilitated communications with steamers in the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the north-eastern Indian and Atlantic Oceans. An antenna tower for radio jamming was built at the corner of Kartamyshevska and Komitetskaya Streets between 1946 and 1961. The Odessa TV tower, built from 1956 to 1958, had a similar construction. But Odessa TV tower was higher than the tower at Katamyshevskaya street. Seem the tower on Kartamyshevskaya street was built before 1957 year. (To see the photos in article The Odessa TV tower and the photos on Church Cite ). M. Raskova Street (1953‚Äì1995) Soviet postage stamp commemorating Marina Raskova, issued in March 1939 –ö–∞—Ç–∞–ª–æ–≥ –º–∞—Ä–æ–∫ : –ú–∞—Ä–∫–∞ ‚Ä∫ Marina Raskowa, navigator. 15-ruble stamp issued on 21 March 2012 commemorating the 100th birth anniversary of Hero of the Soviet Union Marina Raskova In 1953, Kartamyshevska Street was renamed M. Raskova Street in honor of Soviet pilot Marina Raskova (1912-1943). The street was absent from tourist maps from 1970 to the 1980s. It lost its outlet to Frunze Street () due to construction at the intersection of Frunze and M. Raskova Streets which shortened M. Raskova Street to two blocks. Radio jamming ended as the result of a November 1988 Politburo decision, and all jamming stations ceased operation during the night of 29‚Äì30 November. On the, Mikhail Gorbachev announced the end of jamming during an 8 December 1988 session of the UN General Assembly. An order from the Minister of Communications \\"On the cessation of jamming of foreign radio stations broadcasting to the Soviet Union\\" was signed on 19 December 1988. Around this time, jamming also ended in the Warsaw Pact countries. Construction of the First Church of Evangelical Christians and Baptists in Odessa began in 1992, very close to the tower for radio jamming, and was completed in 1997. The tower for radio jamming was deconstructed by helicopter before end of 1997 as it was as it was unable to perform its functions due to progress in radio war during the Clad War period. 1995 to present The street returned to its original name. Kartamyshevskaya Street was included in the following districts of Odessa during the Soviet era: * Petropavlovskiy district from 1920 (or earlier) to 1924 * Iliychevskiy district from 1924 to 1977 * Malinovskiy district from 1977 to the present The Odessa Catacombs, under Golorovskaya, Kartamyshevska and Kosvyennaya Streets and Mikhailovsky Square, date to the 18th century. Although most entrances to the catacombs are on Golokovskaya Street, some are on Kartamyshevska Street.

He was awarded Sahitya Akademi award in 1987.  Life  Harish Vaswani was born in November 1940 in Lor Ilaayi in hill area of Baluchistan (now in Pakistan) to Vaswani family. His family, with his four siblings, fled to India after the Partition of India in 1947. They reached Saurashtra State (now part of Gujarat) by sea as refugees. They faced numerous hardships and had to live in refugee camps. His school education was frequently interrupted as the family moved from one town to another until it settled temporarily in Bantwa in Saurashtra. Vaswani received three post graduate degrees in English, Political Science and Hindi; each as a correspondence student of Aligarh Muslim University. While studying, he worked as a tutor to undergraduate students to sustain himself while living with a relative in old Delhi‚Äôs Daryaganj area. In his mid twenties, Vaswani moved to Adipur, Kutch and joined the Tolani College of Arts & Science as a lecturer. Subsequently, he was elevated to the post of Head of the Department of Political Science. He also taught English literature until his retirement. Influenced by French philosopher-thinkers like Albert Camus and Jean Paul Sartre, he was an atheist who debated religious faith, the political establishment and conformist attitudes. His literary writings are filled with metaphors around the complex narrative and ironies of human existence and the pain of partition, which, like most other Sindhi writers of his generation. He became an avid reader and follower of Buddhism and of psychoanalysis in his later life and briefly took to becoming a Buddhist counselor for a brief period after his retirement. These later influences turned him into a melancholic loner, who stopped writing in 1995, after publicly declaring this intent through his column in Sindhi magazine Rachana. He distanced himself from social engagements in the pursuit of worldly renunciation. He continued visiting Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh in religious pursuits. He had also served as a member of Sindhi Advisory Board, Sahitya Akademi, Delhi. He died on April 13, 2013 in Noida, NCR, Delhi.

His column titled Sanskar Sindhu was about cultural, literary and society issues relating to Sindhis in post partition India. Samvaay was a column of general interest where he wrote about current affairs, political concerns on the global-local stage and popular subjects. Manch was about interpersonal relationships, society and trends, influences of art and literature on life; it was a series of freewheeling commentary pieces on contemporary urban life in juxtaposition and sometimes at loggerheads with the times past. Vaswani's Buddhist leanings had begun to reflect amply in his writings this column. Manovigyanni Drishtithi was about a psychology. He explored intimate relationships, struggles of a society at war with itself, personality issues, Buddhist philosophical thought and psychology, new findings and writings on science of brain.

During his time in the Juncker Commission, Selmayr was widely described as one of the most influential figures within the European Union. After taking office as Secretary-General, he was described in a debate in the European Parliament as \\"the most powerful bureaucrat in the world.\\" A resident of Brussels since 2000, he is a member of the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V;) party of Belgium. He is considered by many to be close to the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and its leadership, but the European Commission said he has never been a member of that party. Early life and career Selmayr studied law at the University of Geneva, before earning his PhD at the University of Passau. He worked for the European Central Bank from 1998 to 2000, before joining the media conglomerate Bertelsmann as a legal adviser in Brussels in 2001. He eventually became Bertelsmann's vice president for legal affairs and government relations and head of the Brussels office. European Commission In 2004, he first joined the European Commission as a civil servant. He went on to serve in a variety of roles, firstly as Commission Spokesperson for Information Society and Media, before becoming Head of Cabinet to the Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, Viviane Reding. He was appointed by the Commission, as a Principal Adviser to the Directorate- General for Economic and Financial Affairs, and as a Director at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In early 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker won the nomination of the European People's Party (EPP) to be their candidate for President of the European Commission. Juncker appointed Selmayr his campaign director, and after the EPP emerged as the largest party in the European Parliament following the election in May 2014, Selmayr became the head of the Juncker transition team. After taking office as President on 1 November 2014, Juncker made Selmayr his Head of Cabinet and Chief of Staff.Hendrik Kafsack: \\"Der starke Mann hinter Juncker,\\" Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 10 September 2014 Shortly after his appointment, various media reports began to profile Selmayr as a highly influential figure within EU politics, with Politico describing him as \\"the most powerful EU chief of staff ever\\" in November 2016, noting that even Jean-Claude Juncker jokingly referred to Selmayr by the nickname \\"the Monster.\\" Tom√°≈° Prouza, the Czech State Secretary for European Affairs, stated publicly that ‚Äúwhen I need a decision to be taken...I talk to Martin\\". In October 2017, he was accused in the British media of leaking details relating to Brexit negotiations, though Selmayr denied these accusations. =Secretary-General= Selmayr was appointed Deputy Secretary-General of the European Commission in February 2018. Minutes after this appointment, Juncker informed the European Commissioners that the then Secretary-General, Alexander Italianer, intended to retire; they had not been previously notified of this.Daniel Boffey, \\"Angry MEPs attack Juncker over elevation of his 'monster' Selmayr\\", The Guardian, 12 March 2018. Retrieved 25 March 2018 On 1 March 2018, following the formal retirement of Italianer, Selmayr was approved by the College of Commissioners to replace him as Secretary-General. Some media sources claimed that support for Selmayr had been \\"bought\\", and with others claiming that Selmayr had \\"forced\\" his way into the position. The President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker reportedly threatened to resign if the controversy led to Selmayr's dismissal. On 25 March 2018 the Commission issued a formal statement claiming that Selmayr's promotion was in accordance with legal procedures.

In the immediate aftermath of his appointment as Secretary-General of the European Commission it was reported that Selmayr had been editing Wikipedia using his own name from an account using a verified ec.europa.eu email address. The Commission stated that he did so to correct specific information (including his work positions as well as political and religious affiliations), \\"in direct interaction with a Wikipedia editor, who checked and verified all information ...and ensured that it is properly referenced\\".COMMISSION ANSWERS TO THE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS OF THE BUDGETARY CONTROL COMMITTEE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ON THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NEW SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 4 April 2018, p.38 Selmayr resigned as Secretary-General on 1 August 2019, having held the office for less time than any of his predecessors; it was speculated that the decision by the European Council to nominate Ursula von der Leyen as replacement for Juncker as Commission President was a factor behind the decision.

Originally built in 1910 as community center. It was used for events such as bingo games, dance recitals, and concerts, and later as a basketball practice hall. It has been restored as a performing arts, gallery space, and restaurant complex. Construction and architecture The white eagle is part of the coat of arms of Poland. White Eagle Hall, which opened in 1910 was built by Polish immigrants and craftsmen under the direction Rev. Peter Boleslaus Kwiatowski, who established numerous parishes in northeastern New Jersey. The facade of the building is adorned with busts of Polish heroes Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Casimir Pulaski, Tadeusz Kosciuszko, and Henryk Sienkiewicz. There are two glass skylights ‚Äì one commemorating Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, the classical music composer, and the other Marcella Sembrich, an internationally renowned opera star. Saint Anthony's In 1934, ownership was transferred to St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church and served, among purposes as a bingo hall. For many years was the practice gym of the national powerhouse St. Anthony High School basketball team, the Friars. They did not play any home games there (they often played at the Jersey City Armory). Coach Bob Hurley led this team to 28 state championships, 4 national championships and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Entertainment venue From 1968 to 1975 \\"Battle of the Bands\\" contests took place on the stage, where talents such as Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Frank Infante, the guitarist for Blondie, got their start. Beginning in 2013, the building underwent a comprehensive multimillion-dollar historic restoration by the Ben LoPiccolo Development Group. The original wood floor was used as bar counters and balcony flooring; wood fixtures from nearby Saint Boniface Church (from 1865) were used in the window frames, bar sides and balcony railings and ledges; Boniface altar fixtures are part the box office and merchandise area. The venue reopened in April 2017 with performances by the Jersey City Theater Center (JCTC). On May 5 a ribbon cutting and opening ceremony (with Mayor Steven Fulop) and first official concert( with Sunshine & The Rain and Rye Coalition).

Its head was called Minister of War. The Ministry of Land Defence Department was established on 16 May 1840 and was merged with the Ministry for Naval Affairs into the newly established Ministry of Defence on 30 June 1920. History The Ministry of Land Defence was established in connection with the ministry reform in 1840. The cases, previously handled by the War Office (Krigsexpeditionen), were now divided between the Ministry of Land Defence and the Ministry for Naval Affairs. The Ministry of Land Defence's first cabinet meeting day was on 19 May 1840. According to the Royal Decree concerning the distribution of cases between the ministries on 16 May 1840 (SFS 1840 No. 14), the following cases sorted under the Ministry of Land Defence: Cases relating to the organization and maintenance of the land defence, as well as the staff, the disposition of funds and equipment to the land defence, the construction and maintenance of fortifications, educational institutions, church and medical affairs, pension and charity facilities for the land army and associated staff; the Allotment system and Roteringsverket for the army; questions about commanding land troops for service or use for the necessary public works; the care of homes and buildings of the land defence, and The Crown's additional insight into the use of artillery foundry (styckebruk), the rifle factories and the gunpowder manufacturing; questions concerning telegraph arrangements (the telegraphic arrangements here means the military optical telegraph) in Sweden, with the exception of the individual needs of the Swedish Navy. In addition came the so-called Command Objectives (Kommandom√•len), i.e. those matters of generally less importance which were determined by the king as Supreme Commander of Sweden's military force. These cases were settled, in accordance with ¬ß15 of the Instrument of Government for the Ministry of Land Defence's concern, by the King, following presentation by the head of the Ministry of Land Defence, and in attendance only by him. The Command Objectives (Kommandom√•len) mainly concerned the Swedish Army's weapons exercises, schools, training courses, personnel accounts, service conditions, regulations, etc. During the period up to the issue of the renewed ministry statute in 1900, the ministry was liberated from some of the often complex cases relating to the gradual modifications of the allotment system. Following the decommissioning of the allotment system by the new army order in 1901, only the cases relating to its decommissioning remained. Until the Ministry of Land Defence's merging into the Ministry of Defence in 1920, some significant changes in the ministry's area of affairs did not take place. In 1920, the ministry's all cases were transferred to the new ministry. For preparing these cases, the head of the ministry had a department of the Royal Majesty's Chancery (Kunglig Majest√§ts kansli), which consisted of one permanent undersecretary, two deputy directors (kanslir√•d) and directors (byr√•chef), three office secretaries, one registrar and an unspecified number of extra officials (assistants). Under the Ministry of Land Defence sorted government agencies such as: the Military Office (Kommandoexpedition) of the Ministry of Land Defence and the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration. The ministry also belonged to the army with its Generalitet,Generalitet or Generalitetet, the collective term for all the generals in an army. Also the term for (and an administrative corps) for all generals in active service and in the reserve in the Swedish Army. the General Staff, the regiments and the corps, the Commendant Staff (Kommendantskapen), the Royal Swedish Army Staff College, the Artillery and Engineering College, the Royal Military Academy, the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences and other military education and training institutions, the subordinate ordnance, ammunition and rifle stores of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration, the investigative offices in Stockholm and at Karlsborg, the Fortification Commissariat (F√§stningsintendenturen) in Stockholm, the State Warehouse Agency (Magasinsstaten) in Stockholm with the Crown Bakery (Kronobageriet), the Carl Gustafs Stads Gev√§rsfaktori, Marieberg's Ammunition Factory, Fortification Treasurers and custodians, the Potassium Nitrate Maker's School (Salpetersjuderiskolan), the Discipline Company at Karlsborg, the garrison hospitals in Stockholm and at Karlsborg, as well as all the foundations of the land defence. As a result of the act on the state ministries on 19 June 1919, the Ministry of Land Defence and the Ministry for Naval Affairs were merged into a new ministry, the Ministry of Defence, from 1 July 1920. Location During the years 1840-1851, the Ministry of Land Defence was, like the Ministry for Naval Affairs, located in the Stenbockska palatset at Birger Jarls torg 4. During this time, however, the Military Office (Kommandoexpeditionen) was located in the so-called Preisiska huset at Drottninggatan 36. In 1851, the ministry moved to Mynthuset (the predecessor of the current Kanslihuset), where it remained until 1920. Ministers The head of the ministry had officially the title of \\"Council of State (Statsr√•d) and head of the Ministry of Land Defence\\", but was commonly referred to as the Minister of War. *1840‚Äì1840 Bror Cederstr√∂m *1840‚Äì1843 Axel Otto M√∂rner *1843‚Äì1844 Arfved Lovisin *1844‚Äì1848 Gustaf Peyron *1848‚Äì1853 Carl Ludvig von Hohenhausen *1853‚Äì1858 Nils Gyldenstolpe *1858‚Äì1862 Magnus Bj√∂rnstjerna *1862‚Äì1867 Alexander Reuterski√∂ld *1867‚Äì1871 Gustaf Abelin *1871‚Äì1877 Oscar Weidenhielm *1877‚Äì1880 Henrik Rosensv√§rd *1880‚Äì1882 Otto Taube *1882‚Äì1887 Axel Ryding *1887‚Äì1888 Gustaf Oscar Peyron *1888‚Äì1892 Hjalmar Palmstierna *1892‚Äì1899 Axel Rappe *1899‚Äì1903 Jesper Crusebj√∂rn *1903‚Äì1905 Otto Virgin *1905‚Äì1907 Lars Tingsten *1907‚Äì1907 Arvid Lindman *1907‚Äì1911 Olof Malm *1911‚Äì1914 David Bergstr√∂m *1914‚Äì1914 Hjalmar Hammarskj√∂ld *1914‚Äì1917 Emil M√∂rcke *1917‚Äì1917 Joachim √Ökerman *1917‚Äì1920 Erik Nilson *1920‚Äì1920 Per Albin Hansson Permanent Undersecretaries *1840‚Äì1843 ‚Äì Carl David Forsberg *1843‚Äì1844 ‚Äì Carl Wilhelm Riben *1844‚Äì1855 ‚Äì Malcolm von Schantz *1855‚Äì1866 ‚Äì Carl Gustaf √Örman *1866‚Äì1873 ‚Äì Nils Adolf Varenius *1873‚Äì1881 ‚Äì Alfred Sj√∂berg *1881‚Äì1886 ‚Äì Erik Elliot *1886‚Äì1895 ‚Äì Ehrenfried von der Lancken *1895‚Äì1898 ‚Äì Carl Edvard Cassel *1898‚Äì1899 ‚Äì Emil Sj√∂berg *1899‚Äì1904 ‚Äì Carl Herman Weidenheim *1904‚Äì1909 ‚Äì Fredrik Bergenholtz *1909‚Äì1916 ‚Äì Oscar Henry Arsell *1916‚Äì1917 ‚Äì Carl Malmroth (acting) *1917‚Äì1920 ‚Äì Knut S√∂derwall State Secretaries *1917‚Äì1920 ‚Äì Carl Malmroth Head of the Military Office (Kommandoexpeditionen) *1912‚Äì1915 ‚Äì Georg Nystr√∂m *1915‚Äì1919 ‚Äì Hjalmar S√§fwenberg *1919‚Äì1920 ‚Äì Oscar Nygren Footnotes References Land Defence Sweden Sweden, Land Defence Sweden, Land Defence ","title":"Ministry of Land Defence"},{"id":"53948287","text":"The canton of Sartenais-Valinco is an administrative division of the Corse-du- Sud department, southeastern France.

History  The farm appeared for the first time in an inventory of the year 1542 under the name of Oppig√•rden, owned by the peasant P√•vel Olof Rolfsson, but the buildings acquired their present form in the nineteenth century. The two residential buildings, Sommarstugan (\\"Summer Residence\\") and Vinterstugan (\\"Winter Residence\\"), were built in 1848 for Sven Johansson and his wife G√∂lin Jonsdotter, who inherited his father's farm. However, the couple preferred to live in the Sven farm in S√∂rk√§msta. It was not until 1887 that the farm became permanently inhabited by the couple's grandson, Sven Persson. It acquired its current name in the 1930s, when it became the property of the brothers Enno and Lars Johansson and was nicknamed \\"Bommapojkarna\\". It continues to be a private property..  Architecture  Besides the residential buildings, the farm includes a barn with a shed, an attic and a forge. All these buildings are made of wooden logs.

Colt House is a historic house at 154 Wethersfield Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut. Built in 1855, it is a high-quality example of Italianate architecture. It was built for James B. Colt, the brother of industrialist Samuel Colt, whose Armsmear estate is just to the north. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The James B. Colt House is located in the Sheridan-Charter Oak neighborhood of southern Hartford, on the east side of Wethersfield Avenue near its junction with Alden Street. It is situated facing Colt Park, a public city park that was originally part of the Colt family estate, and is south of the larger Armsmear estate of Samuel Colt. It is a three-story masonry structure, built out of brick covered in stucco. It has classic Italian villa features, including a low-pitch hip roof with deep bracketed eaves, and round-arch windows with decorative bracketed caps. The street-facing west facade is restrained, with a single-story porch across its left half that wraps around to the north. The western facade provides vistas of the park through tall windows on all three levels. The house was built in 1855-57. James B. Colt was then serving as treasurer for the Colt's Manufacturing Company, and lived in the house until 1859. It afterward had a number of high-profile occupants, including General William B. Franklin, Colt's general manager until 1888, and George H. Day, one of Hartford's leading businessmen at the turn of the 20th century. In the 20th century the building was subdivided into apartments, and suffered an inside fire in 1973.

Early life and education Morris was born in 1902 in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. He was the third child of James Demetrius Morris, a New Zealander of Greek descent, and his Victorian-born wife Margaret Jane Smith. He was educated at St Patrick's College, East Melbourne, and then studied arts and law at the University of Melbourne. Legal career On 7 November 1927, Morris was admitted to the Victorian Bar. In October 1930, he and his new wife, Mary McDermott, moved to Hobart, where Morris was admitted to the Tasmanian Bar. He joined the law firm of Albert Ogilvie, later becoming a partner in the firm with Ogilvie and Nick McKenna, which was renamed Ogilvie, McKenna & Morris in 1931. Morris eventually handled most of the firm's case work when Ogilvie and McKenna shifted their focus to political aspirations, and he left the partnership in 1938 to establish his own legal practice. In July 1939, the Premier of Tasmania, Edmund Dwyer-Gray appointed Morris to the Supreme Court of Tasmania as acting Chief Justice while Sir Harold Crisp was on long service leave pending his retirement. With Crisp's term concluded in April 1940, Morris was sworn in as Chief Justice on 15 April. He was made Knight Bachelor on 1 January 1943, and upgraded to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1952. As Chief Justice, Morris oversaw the 1947 case of corruption charges against the Premier, Robert Cosgrove, in which Cosgrove was acquitted of all charges and resumed the premiership in February 1948. Academic role On 25 February 1944, Morris was appointed as Chancellor of the University of Tasmania. As Chancellor, he was considered to have improved conditions at the economically disadvantaged institution. In 1952, he appointed Sydney Sparkes Orr as chair of philosophy. In 1954, the university's staff association called for Morris to resign, after he was accused of dominating the council after he overrode the professorial board's refusal to admit a student who had not matriculated with a mathematics subject‚Äîthe student was Christopher Koch, who later became a well-known author. A royal commission was held in 1955, which recognised Morris' contribution to the university, but criticised him. The strain of these conflicts and criticism exacerbated Morris' already poor health due to over- exertion, and he died from a coronary occlusion at his desk in the Supreme Court chambers on 3 July 1956, aged 53.

History  Mauriana was among the many towns in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis which were important enough to become a suffragan diocese, in the papal sway, but destined to fade so completely (at the 7th century advent of Islam?) that its present location in modern Algeria hasn't even been established. Its earliest recorded bishop may have been Lucianus, who assisted, according to Morcelli, at a council in Rome in 337; Mesnage believes that geographically implausible and suggests his see may rather have been Mariana, Corsica. Mauriana's only historically sure incumbent was Secondus, participant in the Council called at Carthage in 484 by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, after which he was exiled, like most Catholic participants, unlike their Donatist heretic counterparts.

This described events in Atlanta during the war. Author Margaret Mitchell said this memoir inspired some of her passages in her novel Gone with the Wind (1936). Gay also published a book of poetry (1858), which she republished after the war to raise money to help support her mother and sister. She also was active in the work to preserve Confederate battlefields and helped raise money to construct monuments and cemeteries. Gay raised thousands of dollars in Texas to pay for a fence and gate at the newly established McGavock Confederate Cemetery in 1866 in Franklin, Tennessee. Her brother was among the nearly 2,000 Confederates reinterred there from temporary battlefield graves. In 1997 Gay was named a Georgia Woman of Achievement. Her home during and after the Civil War, the Mary Gay House, has been preserved in downtown Decatur. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Biography Mary Ann Gay was born to William and Mary (Stevens) Gay on March 18, 1829, in Jones County, Georgia. Shortly after Mary Ann was born, her father died. Her newly widowed mother moved with her children back to her family near Milledgeville, Georgia. They lived in the house of Mary Gay's grandfather, Thomas Stevens, a planter and slave owner. He was depicted harshly in the book A Slave Life in Georgia (1854) by John Brown, one of his slaves who escaped and settled in England, where his memoir was first published. Stevens also owned property around the state, including in DeKalb County, where he became active in politics by 1829. In the 1830s, Mary's mother moved with her to Decatur, the county seat. There she married Joseph Stokes, a lawyer who had her father and brothers as a client. They moved out to Cassville, Georgia, and Mary Stokes had two more children with Joseph: Thomas (Thomie) J. Stokes (b. 1837) and Missouria Horton Stokes (b. 1838). Mary Stokes' father Thomas Stevens lived with them. By his bequest, the young Mary Gay was sent to Nashville for four years of school at a girls' academy. When Stokes died in 1850, Gay's newly widowed mother moved with her three children to a house on Marshall Street in Decatur, Georgia. Gay lived in this house throughout the years of the Civil War. She published her first poetry collection in 1858, anonymously, at age 29. During the Civil War, Mary Gay was a loyal supporter of the Confederate side. She refused to leave her house even when Union Army soldiers took over the area. Gen. Kenner Garrard occupied her house at one point, and his troops camped in her yard. Her only brother, Thomas Stokes, served under Gen. John Bell Hood in the Confederate Army and died in the Battle of Franklin in late 1864. alt=A grey-haired woman wearing all black, standing outdoors. After the war Gay worked to preserve Confederate battlefields and to raise memorials to honor Confederate soldiers in the war. She also helped raise funds for the construction of a new building for the local Baptist church in Decatur. Another project was to fund the reburial to a new cemetery of the 1,750 Confederate dead from the Battle of Franklin, including her brother who had died there. Gay traveled to Texas, where she raised several thousand dollars to support the creation of McGavock Confederate Cemetery. The funds were enough to enclose the cemetery with an iron fence and gate, which was marked with a plaque with her name. She also successfully campaigned for a memorial to Alexander H. Stephens at his grave at Liberty Hall. Gay reprinted her book Prose and Poetry (1858) after the war and marketed it \\"aggressively\\" in order to support her family. The book came to the attention of Mark Twain, who quoted it \\"with disdain\\" in Chapter 21 of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876). He wrote that Gay's work was \\"after the school-girl pattern.\\" In 1892 Gay published her war memoir Life in Dixie During the War based on her memories, her half-sister Missouria's journal, and letters from her half-brother Thomas. Covering the years from 1861 through 1865, it became her best-known work. It influenced Margaret Mitchell's novel Gone With the Wind (1936); some scenes are drawn \\"directly from Gay's memoir\\". Gay also wrote a novel, The Transplanted: A Story of Dixie Before the War (1907), with an introduction by Walter Neale, the New York publisher. It opens in the 1840s on a Mississippi plantation owned by a man of Scots descent. Historians have explored the important role of planter and middle-class women in creating the memory and history of the Civil War. For instance, the United Daughters of the Confederacy had organized, initially to raise funds to get the Confederate dead decently buried in cemeteries. They also raised money to erect monuments to the war and their dead. In addition, by the late 19th century, its leaders encouraged Southern women such as Gay to publish their memoirs and other writings about the war, in order to tell their side of the conflict. They helped them find publishers, and also began to influence the content of textbooks. It was the beginning of formation of Southern memory about the war, the \\"Lost Cause\\", and a view that excluded slavery as basic to the conflict. Gay never married. After the death of her sister Missouria in 1909, Gay began to suffer from dementia in her old age. She was committed to the Georgia State Sanitarium in 1915, where she died on November 21, 1918. She is buried in Decatur Cemetery. Honors In 1997 Gay was inducted into the Georgia Women of Achievement Hall of Fame. Her home in Decatur has been preserved as the Mary Gay House and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is currently one of the largest Wildlife Organisations in South Asia. Although internationally known for groundbreaking work of eradicating the cruel and barbaric practice of dancing bears from the streets of India while creating alternative livelihoods for the nomadic communities that depended on the exploitation of the bears, WSOS is also known for their efforts at rescue and rehabilitation of sloth bears and more recently elephants. Wildlife SOS also runs active projects focused on mitigation of human wildlife conflict with regard to species like leopards, macaques, elephants, moon bears, snakes, and other animals across several states in India. In addition, their work includes projects targeted at biodiversity and habitat conservation, awareness workshops and anti-poaching operations, as well as the rehabilitation of communities dependent on performing or working animals for their livelihood. Their work was documented in the TV series \\"India's Jungle Heroes.\\" History Wildlife SOS was founded in 1995 by Kartick Satyanarayan and Geeta Seshamani with the motive of protecting and preserving India's natural heritage, forests and wildlife. Initially dedicated to the eradication of the centuries-old practice of 'dancing' bears, the organisation now runs several projects across the country focused on rescuing wildlife in distress, mitigating man-animal conflict, habitat restoration, raising awareness, training enforcement officers, conducting scientific research and conservation studies, combating illegal wildlife poaching and trafficking and rehabilitating wildlife-dependent communities.  Mission  Wildlife SOS aims to protect and preserve India‚Äôs wildlife, run rehabilitation and rescue centres for wildlife, conserve habitats, raise awareness, conduct research, study biodiversity and provide sustainable alternative livelihoods for communities otherwise dependent on wildlife to earn a livelihood.  Projects  = Sloth bears = 308x308px The sloth bear (Melurus ursinus) is a medium-sized omnivorous species of bear found in the Indian subcontinent, predominantly India, with a small population in Nepal and Bhutan, and a sub-species in Sri Lanka. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red list. One of the major causes of this is the exploitation of sloth bears as ‚Äòdancing‚Äô bears by members of a nomadic tribe known as the Kalandars or Qalandars (a trade declared illegal under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972), poaching and mistreatment of the animals to support the same, and trafficking of bear parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine ‚Äì contributing to the declining numbers of sloth bears in the wild. A dancing bear and its Kalandar Master Wildlife SOS is credited with the eradication of the ‚Äòdancing bear‚Äô practice in India, rescuing bears from abusive owners and poachers and rehabilitating them in one of four centers in India- 1\\\\. Agra Bear Rescue Facility (2000) in Agra 2\\\\. Bannerghatta Bear Rescue Facility (2005) in Karnataka 3\\\\. Van Vihar Bear Rescue Facility (2006) in Bhopal 4\\\\. Purulia Bear Rescue Centre (2007) in West Bengal Here, the bears are given the medical care required, fed and allowed to socialize and roam in large, free-range areas. So far, more than 640 sloth bears have been rehabilitated by the organization. Wildlife SOS also carries out ex-situ conservation studies on the bears to enhance existing conservation measures for the species‚Äô survival and provides sustainable, alternative livelihoods to the bears‚Äô former owners and their families. = Elephants = The Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) is one of three recognized subspecies of the Asian elephant, native to mainland Asia and is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red list. 301x301pxElephants are under threat due to poaching, habitat destruction, man-animal conflict and encroachment. Ignorance and a lack of awareness have resulted in the continuous enslavement of these animals as working elephants- to beg, for display in temples, for performances and entertainment, ceremonies and physical labour. Wildlife SOS works in collaboration with the Government of India‚Äôs Project Elephant and in partnership with the Haryana Forest Department at Ban Santour and the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department at Mathura to confiscate abused and mistreated elephants and provide them safe and healthy retirement in one of the two elephant sanctuaries it manages - the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre (set up in 2011) in Mathura and the Elephant Rescue Centre (set up in 2010) in Haryana. Wildlife SOS is currently caring for 23 rehabilitated elephants at these two centers. Medical treatment is made available for injured or sick elephants, and handlers, known as mahouts, are trained in humane treatment and management of the animals to improve their working conditions and reduce illicit poaching and mistreatment of the animals. In 2014, Wildlife SOS announced its mission to rescue the then 67 remaining elephants from circuses in India. At the beginning of 2016, 8 circus elephants were already in the care of the organization. The Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre (ECCC) was established in 2009 in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department to address the conservation issues facing Asian elephants in India. The main objectives of the centre are to eradicate illegal trafficking and holding of elephants, creating a platform for public awareness about the threats faced by Asian elephants, and ensuring the safety and protection of elephants in the wild while pioneering humane, modern and scientific management of elephants in India as a replacement of traditional methods of management that are fraught with risks to the elephants, owners and mahouts. ECCC serves as a model centre where humane management and training of elephants is practiced in a country where traditional management methods involving abuse and starvation have been in wide use for centuries. In 2018, Wildlife SOS established India's first elephant hospital at its Elephant Conservation and Care Centre to provide specialized medical treatment to sick and aged elephants.Rescued Asiatic Black Bear at the Dachigam Bear Rescue Centre = Moon bears = The Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), also called the Moon bear, is one of four species of bear found in India. The range of the Asiatic black bear extends across the Himalayas, from Bhutan to Pakistan. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red list. Wildlife SOS works in Kashmir to mitigate human-animal conflict that arises when bears wander into human settlements, incidents of which increase with deforestation and encroachment. Wildlife SOS has been working with the Jammu and Kashmir Wildlife Protection Department and the Forest Department since 2007, attempting to mitigate the conflict situation in the area. As part of this project, known as the Moon Bear Conservation Project, Wildlife SOS conducts training workshops for the staff of the J&K; Wildlife Protection Department with focus on capacity building and training in the use of specialized tranquilizing equipment and avoidance behaviour, carries out extensive studies on man-animal conflict situations and treats and rehabilitates animals that fall victim to confrontation- in particular moon bears and leopards. If possible, the animals are released back into the wild, else they are cared for and treated by Wildlife SOS staff at centers in Pahalgam and Dachigam in Kashmir. Rescued Leopard at the Wildlife SOS Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre = Leopards = The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of five big cats found in India (also found in Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan) and is listed as near-threatened on the IUCN Red List. The animals are under threat due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to habitat encroachment and poaching. The scrub jungle of Maharashtra was ideal habitat for the leopard until incentives for the cultivation of sugarcane lead to rampant callous farming practices and encroachment of the leopards‚Äô habitat, causing man- animal conflict to escalate. In 2008, Wildlife SOS collaborated with the state government on the expansion of the existing Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar, near Pune, which currently houses 30 leopards. In addition, Wildlife SOS veterinarians and biologists conduct awareness workshops and training programs for local communities, the Forest Department, law enforcement, educational institutions and forums to help raise awareness and mitigate conflict situations. = Biodiversity conservation = Wildlife SOS‚Äô habitat conservation project is situated near the Ram Durga valley in Koppal, Karnataka, and aims at protecting critical sloth bear habitat, threatened by illegal mining activities, rampant deforestation and encroachment by human settlements and industries which, along with poaching, massacred the wildlife of the region. In 2007, Wildlife SOS purchased nearly 40 acres of land in the region, creating a crucial wildlife corridor by allowing at-risk habitats to link up with a patch of Reserve Forest. The project was expanded in 2012, with the acquisition of an additional 10 acres of land, made possible by the support of BHEL, PSSR, Chennai. In consultation with experts, appropriate species of vegetation were selected and an extensive afforestation project was undertaken- planting nearly 10,000 saplings. A bore well, drip irrigation system and solar powered electrical fencing were acquired. Local community members were employed to manage and patrol the land, allowing the project to achieve a 90% plant survival rate in just 2‚Äì3 years. The vegetation flourished and, in areas where conservation efforts had been initiated earlier, species of wildlife have begun returning, including sloth bear, leopards and endangered species like the pangolin and star tortoise. In addition, Wildlife SOS works with local communities and stakeholders, and works to educate them so as to increase their involvement in forest protection. The organization works to secure agricultural land along forested area, to serve as safe buffers for wildlife. = Anti-poaching = Wildlife SOS works to curb the illegal trade and trafficking of wildlife and wildlife products - birds, mammals and reptiles, along with skins, bones and other body parts harvested from poached animals. Efforts at eradicating the practice of ‚Äòdancing‚Äô bears and related poaching have resulted in a marked reduction in bear poaching as per statistics. However, it still persists to feed demand in neighboring countries and Wildlife SOS has had to rescue more than 73 sloth bear cubs from poachers over ten years. Wildlife SOS‚Äô anti-poaching squad, Forest Watch, consists of a complex network of informants gathering critical information on poachers and criminals involved in the illegal wildlife trade. Forest Watch has assisted the forest department, the police department and law enforcement agencies to crack down on traffickers and smugglers, recover animal skins, body parts, ivory and sometimes live animals from poachers, and even provide legal assistance where required. Wildlife SOS offers further assistance by conducting grassroots-level training workshops focusing on capacity building and wildlife crime prevention in the field. = Conservation Awareness = Understanding that human involvement is crucial to conservation efforts, Wildlife SOS works with local communities in urban and rural areas to educate people regarding their local wildlife and ecosystem. Programs focus on teaching locals how to live sustainably with their environment, helping people deal with man-animal conflict in vulnerable areas and involving locals in conservation efforts such as tree-plantation drives in Jammu and Kashmir, plastic removal drives in Bannerghatta and cleaning the Dal lake with the help of students from local schools and colleges. Orphaned rhesus macaque rescued by Wildlife SOS Wildlife SOS also routinely hosts workshops with law officers, forest department enforcement officers, police and customs officials to educate them about the wildlife trade, recognition of contraband, basic understanding of related law in the field, conflict mitigation and rescue techniques to control human-animal conflict. = Rescue Helplines = In addition to its conservation projects, Wildlife SOS runs a 24-hour animal rescue with a team trained to perform emergency rescues of wild animals in three states ‚Äì Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. The initiative was started in 1998, and now responds to nearly 300 rescue calls a month. The team rescues animals and birds that have been injured, abandoned or trapped in urban areas. Common rescues include monkeys, jackals, snakes, monitor lizards, deer and birds. These are given immediate medical attention and then released in suitable, safer locations in the presence of Forest Department officials. If release is not possible, the animals are relocated to the WSOS Rescue Centre in Gurgaon, set up in 1999. Since 2010, Wildlife SOS has been working in collaboration with the Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) to rescue wildlife trapped in urban localities, particularly snakes and crocodiles in Gujarat. Wildlife SOS‚Äôs rescue team has animal-control contracts with Indira Gandhi Airport, Delhi Golf Club, Agra Developmental Authority, Delhi Jal Board, Akbars Tomb, residential colonies in the city and the Commonwealth Games village for the 2010 Commonwealth games hosted in India. = Tribal Rehabilitation Program = As part of its project to eradicate the erstwhile practice of dancing bears in India, Wildlife SOS runs a simultaneous rehabilitation program for the Qalandar (Kalandar) tribals, for whom the bears provided a source of livelihood. The program, started in 2001, includes incentives for the bear-owners, in the form of sustainable livelihood alternatives. Wildlife SOS may provide seed funds for ventures or assist in the purchase of shops, handcarts, bicycles, cycle-rickshaws, auto-rickshaws or something that could support an alternative career for the individual, as well as providing training for alternative jobs as drivers, small scale poultry or goat farmers, metallurgy or gem-cutting and stone polishing for costume jewelry. Rehabilitated tribals form nearly 50% of the workforce at Wildlife SOS‚Äô rescue centres. Wildlife SOS also organizes vocational courses and seed funding for the womenfolk of the community to start businesses in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, sets up self-help groups and provides them with marketing links, wherever necessary. This allows them to become secondary breadwinners for the family and empowers them through financial independence. Further, Wildlife SOS provides educational opportunities for the children of Kalandars, helping them break out of the cycle of poverty and oppression and eliminating dependency on ‚Äòdancing‚Äô bears for income, thereby reducing poaching and mistreatment of the animals. Wildlife SOS is also involved in the rehabilitation of other traditionally wildlife-dependent communities including the Saperas, an originally nomadic, Muslim tribe of snake-charmers, hiring the community members to work with them as animal rescue workers.

It is directed by Rupert Goold, director of the original play, and stars most of the play's original cast including Tim Pigott-Smith, who died before the film was broadcast, as Charles. Written in blank verse and set in the future, the film focuses on the reign of Charles, Prince of Wales and the surrounding political drama as a result of his accession to the throne. The original play premiered at the Almeida Theatre, London in 2014 before transferring to the West End and Broadway, winning the 2015 Olivier Award for Best New Play. The film was broadcast on 10 May 2017 on BBC Two in the UK, before being broadcast on 14 May 2017 on PBS Masterpiece in the US. It was released on DVD in the UK on 15 May 2017. Plot Charles and his family gather following the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. Charles, as the new king, then holds his first weekly audience with Prime Minister Tristan Evans. They discuss a new Bill for statutory regulation of the press, which has passed the House of Commons and the House of Lords and awaits only Charles's royal assent to become law. Charles is concerned that the law restricts freedom of the press too much, and would allow the government to censor the news and prevent legitimate uncovering of abuse of power. He asks the PM for alterations to the bill, but the PM refuses. As the two men spar, Mrs Stevens, the Leader of the Opposition, arrives for a weekly meeting with Charles, an innovation the new king has introduced. Stevens expresses her own doubts on the bill, and despite reminding the king of his level of power, she sees little alternative but for Charles to sign. In parallel, Prince Harry has begun a relationship with Jessica Edwards, a working class republican who has made him reconsider his desire to remain a member of the royal family. Jess later approaches royal press adviser James Reiss about an ex-boyfriend of hers, who is threatening to leak compromising photographs of her which she fears could damage both her and the prince's reputation. Both Charles and Prince William have seen the ghost of Princess Diana, promising each man that he will become \\"the greatest king of all\\". One of Charles' first actions is to refuse to give royal assent to the press regulation bill. The Prime Minister holds a crisis meeting with the Leader of the Opposition and then goes alone to try to convince Charles to sign, but Charles continues to refuse. Evans then threatens to pass a new law bypassing the royal assent and then pass the press law. However, just prior to the vote, Charles enters the chamber and uses his power of the royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament, preventing the PM from bringing either plan into effect. Charles' actions are reluctantly supported by Douglas Rowe, the Speaker of the House of Commons, who subsequently refuses to allow the parliament to re-assemble. Protests begin across the country, with the most violent taking place in London. In response, Charles increases the army guard at Buckingham Palace, a move which only further increases the tension between him and the British government. He then offers royal protection to Jess, whom the media have made the centre of a sex scandal after her ex-boyfriend leaked the photos to The Sun. He also agrees to Harry's wish to become a commoner, so he can live a more fulfilling life with Jess. The PM, increasingly concerned with the backlash as a result of the king's actions, meets with William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales to discuss the matter. Catherine, not wanting to lose the opportunity to rule alongside William in the future, proposes a solution: William will serve as a mediator between Parliament and his father. William joins his father in a press conference, where he announces the plan without the king's knowledge or consent. Seeing this as a betrayal, Charles reacts angrily to both his son and press adviser James Reiss. During a tense meeting with William, William angrily rebukes his father for creating disorder, as well as chastising him for his mistreatment of Diana during her lifetime and asks him to abdicate to help restore order. As Catherine and Harry await in another room in Buckingham Palace, the three deliver an ultimatum to the king, threatening to remove themselves (and their children) from his life unless he steps down. Unwilling to face the rest of his life alone, Charles reluctantly abdicates in favour of William, who plans to sign the press bill and restore the status quo between the monarchy and Parliament, in addition to quelling the public unrest. Prior to the joint coronation at Westminster Abbey, Harry meets with Jess and reluctantly informs her they can no longer be together, as their former plans would upset the status quo with the new king and his position in the public sphere. The film ends with William and Kate's coronation as king and queen consort, with Charles angrily placing the crown on his son's head in lieu of the Archbishop of Canterbury before exiting as the crowd proclaims \\"God Save the King\\".

In the original play, Nyasha Hatendi played multiple roles including Spencer, Paul and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Parth Thakerar played these roles in the subsequent UK tour. Controversy The screening of the production on the British national broadcaster was controversial. The Mail on Sunday published claims by Rosa Monckton, a close friend of Diana, Princess of Wales, that the BBC was broadcasting irresponsible rumours concerning the paternity of Prince Harry. However, Kate Maltby, writing in the Financial Times, defended the show and criticised The Mail on Sunday's \\"somewhat manufactured row.\\" The Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told The Mail on Sunday it was \\"unfortunate the BBC would seek to promote this flight of fantasy, which many licence-fee payers will find distasteful and which I believe denigrates and undermines our royal family.\\" Similarly, former Conservative defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth told The Daily Telegraph: \\"It is extraordinarily insensitive for an organisation which is so consumed with political correctness. It is pure indulgence by the BBC to run a play featuring the demise of the sovereign and ascribing to a popular member of the Royal family [the Duchess of Cambridge] base motives.\\" However, John Whittingdale, a former Culture Secretary, publicly defended the show, writing in The Daily Telegraph: \\"If the BBC has commissioned a production of a decent play how can one possibly object to that?\\" he asked. \\"High-quality drama is at the heart of public service broadcasting...Some of my colleagues get hysterical about this kind of thing. I don't think the Queen is the least bit offended.\\" Critical reception Reviewing the programme for The Daily Telegraph, Jasper Rees gave it five stars, calling it \\"pure televisual gelignite\\", adding that, \\"In a towering performance, Pigott-Smith, who passed away last month, suggested unendurable agonies of conscience as events stripped him of his identity\\". Rees concluded by saying, \\"Bartlett's supremely supple ear filtered the story through digestible blank verse meshing cod-Bard and street demotic. Perhaps this majestic, unmissable drama will send new audiences back to the source for meaningful encounters with Lear, Lady M, Brutus, Prince Hal and other forebears.\\" In The Guardian, Mark Lawson began his review by noting that, \\"Some newspaper coverage ahead of the BBC2 screening of King Charles III ‚Äì a drama imagining a brief and catastrophic reign for the current Prince of Wales ‚Äì gave the impression that [‚Ä¶] the BBC director-general, should be held in the Tower of London awaiting execution for treason\\", but judged instead that \\"the summons he seems more likely to get is to next year's Bafta TV awards, where the BBC will surely be honoured for one of its boldest drama commissions\\". Lawson found that \\"Pigott-Smith's performance and Bartlett's script avoid any trace of the pettiness, temper and self-indulgence attributed to Charles by biographers [‚Ä¶] 'What am I?,' Charles asks, a line that Pigott-Smith, with an agonised sigh, makes as existentially heart-wrenching as Hamlet's To be, or not to be\\". Lawson finished his review by acknowledging that, \\"King Charles III, on TV, is two different things: an outrage for those who believe the monarchy should always be reverenced, especially by the BBC, but also a drama with the highest quality of acting, writing and filming. Strangely, those versions sometimes co-exist: a paper whose front page railed against the BBC for questioning Prince Harry‚Äôs DNA gave the play a five-star preview on its TV pages on the same day.\\" Writing in The Stage, Stewart Pringle remarked, \\"Sweep away the desperate and derelict controversy that's frothed around its broadcast, and this TV adaptation of Mike Bartlett's 2014 future-history play King Charles III is a delightful anachronism ‚Äì a play for today\\". He observed that the translation from stage to screen had resulted in \\"a production that cosies close to the text, and to the performers who made it sing\\", but also that, \\"there are inevitable alterations, both gains and losses, that have occurred in the translation. Many are contextual ‚Äì the effect of a soliloquy delivered to an audience is startlingly different to a monologue delivered straight to camera\\". Pringle found the echoes of Ian Richardson's \\"to-camera monologues\\" in the To Play the King series of the House of Cards trilogy to be problematic, and also \\"the language and meter. What felt ingenious on stage occasionally clunks on screen, and while some of the strangeness fades as the gallop of Bartlett's story-telling takes off, it still feels hazardously close to the kind of fakespeare gimmickery that the original production side-stepped\\". However, he praised \\"the 11th hour capturing of Tim Pigott-Smith's career-best performance as the beleaguered monarch. Frailer now, or perhaps just frailer in close-up, his shifts from bewilderment to iron resolve, his half-fatherly half-vengeful stare are as powerful as anything on telly, stage or elsewhere\\". Pringle concluded, \\"It remains a cracking story, Bartlett's plotting a pure pleasure, his satire stiletto-sharp. Pigott-Smith holds the screen, utterly, as he did the stage, and Goold has done a double service in bronze-casting that performance for future generations, and building a rare and encouraging bridge between the telly-box and some of the country's best and brightest new stage writing\\". Following the premiere, The Daily Express and The Belfast Telegraph drew attention to a number of viewers' responses, including demands that Pigott-Smith be given a posthumous BAFTA. The BBC broadcast drew a live audience of 1.8 million viewers according to overnight ratings, before it was added to the BBC's streaming catch-up service.

Extending for a single block from the South Green to Morris Street, it was developed in the 1850s with modest two-family residences, with infill development of larger apartment blocks around the turn of the 20th century. The entire street was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as a good example of a well-preserved late-19th century residential street. Description Congress Street is located south of downtown Hartford. It is a narrow one-way street extending south from its junction with Wyllys Street at South Green, to Morris Street. It is lined with paved sidewalks on both sides, which are separated from the street by a section of cobblestone construction and granite curbs. At the northern end of the street is its only commercial building, a triangular \\"flatiron\\" building shaped by the junction of Maple Avenue, Wyllys, and Congress. It houses commercial establishments on the ground floor and residences on the upper floors. The west side of the street is predominantly lined by a series of Italianate two-family brick houses built in the late 1850s, while the east side is taken up by larger apartment block dating to the turn of the 20th century. Congress Street was laid out in 1855, serving in part as an access to the back sides of large mansion houses facing Wethersfield Avenue, which it parallels to the east, and whose properties extended all the way to Congress Street. The west side of Congress Street was developed in the 1850s, benefiting from the growth of the Colt Armory to the east. Prominent residents of the early period included Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney, machinists who founded a business now known as Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems, and whose names grace the more well-known Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine manufacturer. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many of the estates facing Wethersfield Avenue were subdivided or redeveloped, and the apartment blocks facing Congress Street were built. The area underwent a major rehabilitation in the 1970s to restore its 19th-century character.

It is composed in the same meter as the Shahnameh. The author mentions his name as QƒÅsem-e MƒÅde·∏• in one of the last couplets of the poem. Composed in Herat, it contains nearly 3,600 couplets. It was published in Bombay (Mumbai) in 1309/1886. It should not be confused with another work often called the \\"Jahangirnameh\\" but also the Tuzk- e-Jahangiri. This is the autobiography or memoirs of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir (1569-1627) in Persian prose. Unlike other poems in Persian, Jahangirnameh contains relatively high number of Arabic loanwords, and the stories also were under Islamic influence. According to Zabihullah Safa, this indicates that the poem is composed in late 6th century AH or early 7th century AH. The poem seems to be largely an imitation of the Borzu Nama.

It was the home of Mary Ann Harris Gay, who moved there with her mother and sister about 1850. She and her sister lived there during the American Civil War and afterwards. The house was built approximately 1850 (though the Junior League of Decatur claims it was built about 1820) and is one of the few extant pre-Civil War buildings in the area. The house was entered into the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on May 6, 1975. The house has been moved at least twice. In the early twentieth century, it was moved eastward and oriented to face Marshall Street. While still at this location (524 Marshall St.), it was listed on the NRHP. In the late 1970s development in Decatur threatened the structure. While it originally was located on \\"several acres\\" of land, by 1979 the house was on a 100 foot by 200 foot (1,800 square meters) lot, bordered mostly by businesses and accessible only by a narrow street with no nearby parking. The Junior League of Dekalb County preserved the structure by arranging to have it moved to its current location at 716 West Trinity Place. This location was less than a mile away in Adair Park and immediately adjacent to the historic Swanton House (which had also been moved). The group also successfully petitioned the NRHP for the Gay house to retain its historic status after the move. Since restoration, the basement of the house has been used as the headquarters for the Junior League. The house is operated as an event facility for receptions, parties, weddings, and similar events.

Her major areas of interest have been colonial and indigenous history in Australia, the Pacific and parts of Canada and Africa, with particular interest in Australian Aboriginal women. Her work continues to be cited in national and international debates over indigenous policy.Roberts, Brian, \\"A Debate Remote from Reason\\", Quadrant, 2015-06-06  Career  Born in Adelaide, Brock studied at the University of Adelaide where she was awarded a B.A.(Hons) in 1969 and a PhD in 1992. Brock began her academic career at Edith Cowan University in 1991, gaining successive promotions leading ultimately to a professorial position there in 2007. She was elected a Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 2005, and has held Visiting Fellowships at the University of Basel, Switzerland (2003) and the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, London University (2005). From 1982 to 1989, she was employed as an historian at the Aboriginal Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning in South Australia. Out of this came her first major publication, Women Rites & Sites. Aboriginal Women's Cultural Knowledge, an edited collection of referenced essays based on original reports to the Aboriginal Heritage Unit by herself and seven other non-Aboriginal women expert in this area (Catherine Berndt, Catherine J Ellis & Linda Barwick, Helen Payne, Jen Gibson, Jane M Jacobs, and Luise Hercus), with an additional concluding chapter on the southern region of South Australia written by Fay Gale, a long-established academic researcher of Aboriginal people, to complete an overview of the whole State. The aim of Women Rites & Sites was to demonstrate and correct the cultural bias and gender blindness of previous research on Aboriginal cultural life. It is an early example of new understandings of Australian indigenous history and culture that began to emerge in the 1980s following Henry Reynolds‚Äô The Other Side of the Frontier: Aboriginal Resistance to the European Invasion of Australia (1981), a controversial history of relations between Aboriginal Australians and European settlers, which has been marked as the beginning of the History Wars. Soon after, Brock contributed to the Historical Background to the South Australian Report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (1990), and native title claims in South Australia have often cited her research. Her second and third books (Poonindie: The Rise and Destruction of an Aboriginal Agricultural Community and Outback Ghettoes. A History of Aboriginal Institutionalisation and Survival) also focused on South Australia, while the next (Words and Silences. Aboriginal Women, Politics and Land) continued her focus on indigenous women but in the wider Australian context. Her next and three most recent books (Indigenous Peoples and Religious Change, The Many Voyages of Arthur Wellington Clah and Indigenous Evangelist and Questions of Authority in the British Empire 1750-1940) go beyond the Australian context.

Donald \\"Don\\" Kemp (1947 ‚Äì ca. November 16, 1982) was an advertising executive from New York who disappeared in mysterious circumstances in a remote part of Wyoming in 1982. He remained missing until his remains were discovered in 1986, a short distance from where his car was found abandoned four years previously.  Background  Kemp was working in advertising on Madison Avenue in New York City when a traffic accident left him with debilitating injuries that took him several years to recover from. He decided to leave the rat race and embark on a fresh start in a mountain cabin in the Jackson Hole valley in Wyoming.  Last known movements  Kemp left New York in September 1982 and drove to Wyoming in his Chevrolet Blazer. On November 15, 1982, the day before he disappeared, he visited a museum in Cheyenne, where he stayed for around two hours and did not speak to anyone. Upon leaving the museum, he left behind his briefcase, which contained his diaries, address book, traveler's checks and glasses needed for driving.  Vehicle discovered  On the morning of November 16, 1982, Kemp's car was found abandoned with its engine still running, on a ramp off I-80, 40 miles from the nearest town. The car was so full of belongings that there would have been no space for anyone except the driver. A single pair of footprints in the snow led investigators six miles into the wilderness to a barn, where they found a pile of sticks arranged to start a fire, and three of Kemp's socks. There were no footprints leading away from the barn, but Kemp was nowhere to be found. Nearby, investigators found a duffel bag containing laundry soap, clothes and a teapot, all of which belonged to Kemp. Due to the solitary set of footprints, the lack of space for anyone else in the car, and the featureless terrain which should have enabled searchers to easily spot a human being, investigators believed from the outset that Kemp had either disappeared of his own volition and did not want to be found, or was mentally unstable. Deputy Rod Johnson stated: ‚ÄúI felt the guy was disorientated, and I felt that he didn‚Äôt want to be found. If he would‚Äôve wanted to be found, he would have heard the aircraft, could have waved his arms, got our attention, gone up to a ridge, anywhere, and been sighted.‚Äù Three days after Kemp's disappearance, there was a blizzard and the search was called off. Everyone involved in the search agreed that if Kemp was in the area and not already dead, he would have died in the blizzard.  Mysterious phone calls  Several months after Kemp disappeared, Judy Aiello, a close friend of his from New York, returned home from an extended vacation to find six messages on her answering machine featuring a voice that she was certain was Kemp's, although the caller never stated his name. The caller sounded panicked and read out a number, urging Aiello to call him back. She did so the next day: a man answered and Aiello asked if Don was there. The man replied \\"Yes,\\" then almost immediately said, \\"No\\". Aiello asked the man if he could ask Don to call her back; the man replied \\"Yeah\\" and hung up. Aiello never received a call back. Aiello informed Kemp's mother, Mary, who in turn informed the authorities. They traced the calls to a rented trailer in Casper, Wyoming, occupied by a man named Mark Dennis. Dennis denied making the calls and of ever having met Don Kemp. He suggested that either someone else used his telephone without his knowledge, or that the telephone company made a mistake about the number used to call Aiello. He agreed to a polygraph test and the authorities described him as cooperative and were satisfied that he was not involved in Kemp's disappearance. Mary Kemp disagreed with the police's opinion on Dennis and traveled to Wyoming to question him herself. Dennis refused to speak to Mary Kemp and hired an attorney, before abruptly moving away from Casper three weeks after he was initially questioned by the police.  Remains discovered  Kemp's decomposed remains were discovered in 1986 by hunters a few miles from where his car was found. The autopsy showed no signs of foul play, and the authorities are satisfied that he walked into the wilderness voluntarily and died in or before the blizzard in the immediate aftermath. However, it remains a mystery as to how Kemp's body was not found during the initial search, as his body was located in a clearly visible place that had already been searched.  Sightings and other theories  Mary Kemp never accepted the findings and claimed up until her death in 2014 that her son was murdered by Mark Dennis. The telephone calls remain a mystery, as Judy Aiello's number was unlisted. Theories on online forums have surmised that someone found Kemp's address book that he had left at the museum in Cheyenne, and phoned Aiello as a prank, while others have suggested that Kemp may have been abducted upon leaving the museum, explaining why Aiello was convinced that it was Kemp's voice on the voicemail messages. In addition, two separate sightings of Kemp were reported in Casper in the months following the believed time of his death. One sighting was at an Abraham Lincoln exhibition and the other was at a bar. Online enthusiasts have theorised that Kemp may have been targeted in relation to his research on Abraham Lincoln, believing that he discovered something about Lincoln that would have caused shockwaves and was consequently silenced. In the years following Kemp's death, some of his research notes were stolen, and several of the people who came into possession of these notes died in suspicious circumstances.  Media coverage  Kemp's case was covered in the first-ever episode of long-running investigative show Unsolved Mysteries in January 1987. The case was covered in a June 2016 episode of true-crime podcast The Trail Went Cold.

Combining ablation therapy of tumors with immunotherapy enhances the immunostimulating response and has synergistic effects for curative metastatic cancer treatment. Various ablative techniques are utilized including cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation, laser ablation, photodynamic ablation, stereotactic radiation therapy, alpha-emitting radiation therapy, hyperthermia therapy, HIFU. Thus, combinatorial ablation of tumors and immunotherapy is a way of achieving an autologous, in-vivo tumor lysate vaccine and treating metastatic disease. Mechanism of action Take magnetic hyperthermia for example. By applying magnetic nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia with a threshold of 43 ¬∞C in order not to damage surrounding normal tissues, a significant quantity of heat-shock proteins (HSP) is expressed within and around the tumor tissues, inducing tumor-specific immune responses. In vivo experiments have indicated that magnetic nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia can induce the regression of not only a local tumor tissue exposed to heat, but also distant metastatic tumors unexposed to heat. Partially or entirely ablating primary or secondary metastatic tumors induces necrosis of tumor cells, resulting in the release of antigens and presentation of antigens to the immune system. The released tumor antigens help activate anti-tumor T cells, which can destroy remaining malignant cells in local and distant tumors. Combining immunotherapy (ie: checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cell therapy) and vaccine adjuvants (ie: interferon, saponin) with ablation synergizes the immune reaction, and can treat metastatic disease with curative intent.Cryosurgery initiates inflammation and leaves tumor-specific antigens intact, which may induce an anti-tumor immune response. Ablation therapies Various local ablation therapies exist to induce necrosis of tumor cells and release tumor antigens to stimulate an immunological response. These ablation therapies can be combined with a systemic immunotherapy: *Thermal ablation ‚Äì local thermal ablation of tumor: ** Cryoablation ** Radiofrequency ablation ** High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation ** Laser ablation ** Photodynamic ablation ** Hyperthermia therapy *Ablation with alpha radiation therapy ** A new type of ablation therapy that utilizes alpha radiation is now undergoing clinical trials for treatment of several types of solid tumors. Alpha particles are emitted from intratumorally-inserted seeds that have Ra-224 atoms fixed to their surface. When the radium decays, its short-lived daughter isotopes are released from the seeds by recoil energy, disperse in the tumor, and emit high energy alpha particles, which destroy the tumor. This therapy is called \\"Diffusing Alpha-emitting Radiation Therapy\\" or DaRT. * Nanotechnology in thermal ablation and immunotherapy ** Currently nanotechnologies has been continuously developed for cancer immunotherapy for their versatility in integration of therapeutic and diagnostic (or termed 'theranostic') multimodalities. For example, iron oxide nanoparticles can generate heat under alternating magnetic field (100 kHz to 1 MHz); and they can also be utilized as imaging contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for visualizing and monitoring the generation, distribution and biological activities of iron oxide nanoparticles. Magnetic nanoparticles can be concentrated to the tumor site via externally applied magnetic field, which is also advantageous in minimizing dose-related side effects. Localized heat can also trigger release of certain anti-cancer immuno-therapeutics loading from the nano-scale cargos if the nanomaterials are heat-responsive. From biological aspect, local heating can in addition significantly increase the extravasation of nanoscale drug carriers from tumor vessels, which enhances the performance of anti-cancer drug delivery to target cancers.

He hoped to prove the existence of spiritualism using scientific methodology. The methods he most often uses are spirit photography and automatic writing using a planchette. Given the time the book was published, this view was not regarded as abnormal. The case studies described in the book are collected by the author and consist mostly of his experiences and reports he received.  Context  The book was published during spiritualisms peak growth in membership which happened from the 1840s to the 1920s.Braude, Ann Braude (2001). Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America, Second Edition. Indiana University Press. p. 296. . During that time, spiritualism flourished and had around eight million followers in Europe and the United States of America. The population of spiritualism followers was mostly composed of middle and upper classes.  Structure  The book is divided into six parts. It contains a preface to the third edition, the introduction to the second edition, an introduction, six chapters, a notes and comments section and an appendix. The introductions of the third and second edition emphasize that the content still holds valid at this later time and the normal introduction is used to discuss the dangers of investigating spiritualism. In the chapters, the book comprises five instances of psychic behavior, each dealing with a different protagonist.  Content  The individual cases described in this book include: =Case P.F.= This section is about the son of a family friend who the author suspects of having a \\"psychic gift\\". Raupert reports that the twenty-six year old is causing things that he comes in contact with to vibrate. The author then conducts further experiments with P.F. without holding a classical seance. During this, P.F writes using a planchette while the author's wife talks to him to keep him occupied. He reports that they were able to speak to spirits in this way. Later, P.F. suffers a physical collapse while they are performing Spirit photography. Nevertheless, the photography was successful and the spirit was able to tell the name of the person seen on the pictures through writing before the images were developed. P.F. did not know the name and the photos indeed revealed a face similar to the aforementioned person. In a later experiment the author and P.F. are able to talk to a deceased coworker of P.F. The author continues with describing the adverse effects that the seances had on P.F. but that he regained his good health after they stopped the experiments =Case M.S.= The second case study is about a grammar school teacher who starts talking to a deceased friend using a planchette. Later, instead of talking to his friend he finds himself talking to a different spirit. Unable to stop the automatic writing the teacher continues even at night. By talking to friends he finds out that the spirit he talks to, Jack W., died in an Asylum. After hearing this he decides to stop using the planchette but soon notices that his personality had changed after interacting with Jack W.. He reports having two personalities, one which he calls \\"ego\\"and one which he calls \\"alter\\", that represents thoughts that he normally would not have. Although he can not be sure what caused this, he suspects that his \\"dabbeling in telepathy\\" caused it. =The Photographer= This section describes experiments that Raupert conducted with a photographer in the direction of Spirit photography. They meet and take several pictures that are supposed to show spirits, although Raupert expresses concerns that the method was used fraudulent in the past. During one experiment, the author and the photographer take pictures spontaneously, which according to Raupert is evidence enough that the spirits shown on the pictures could not be faked, as they could not prepare. And indeed the developed photos show an old women. The author even talks to the spirit and subsequently shoots a clearer. picture of the spirit talks to a spirit which subsequently. In another experiment Raupert manages to shoot a picture of a deceased relative that promised him to help him in his exploration of spiritualism. Because of this, the author expresses ethical concerns regarding Spirit photography as it could potentially be dangerous to repeat such experiments. =Case M. = This case study is about an acquaintance of Raupert who underwent an \\"transformation of his mental and moral life, following his spiritistic experiments\\". He becomes interested and tries using a Planchette. After slow advances he even uses it at night and like case M.S. finds himself with two personalities after some time. In contrast to M.S. \\"the other one\\" takes complete control over M. at an increasing rate. During an experiment with M., Raupert is able to talk to the spirit directly and tells him to leave. =Case of the businessman= The last case, is about an acquaintance of the author who starts automatic writing. Although not believing in spirits but rather in unconsciousness as the cause of it, he makes it a habit of his. After some time, he experienced a pressing feeling on top of his hat that would only disappear if he writes. After some months apart, the author meets his acquaintance again, who was involved in a severe accident and only just left the hospital. He tells Raupert that he was sitting inside an electric tram, when he had the irresistible urge to jump of the train while it was still in motion and run alongside it. He planned on jumping back on at the front end. Instead, he fell and his feet were crushed by the tram. He thinks the spirits are responsible for it and regrets that he did not follow Rauperts earlier advice to stop automatic writing. Reception and Change of John Godfrey Raupert The book seems to have been well received as several editions were published. The author John Godfrey Raupert later converted to Catholicism and renounced Spiritualism. He was commissioned by Pope Pius X to warn Catholics about the Ouija board. The Ouija board is one of the successor of the Planchette. He is reported to have said: \\"For more reasons than one the board should not be tolerated in any Christian household or placed within the reach of the young.\\" See also * Spiritualism * List of Spiritualist organizations * Spiritism References Sources * Category:Books about spirituality Category:1901 non-fiction books ","title":"The Dangers of Spiritualism"},{"id":"53949200","text":"Eil√≠s Veronica Ferran, FBA (born 14 March 1962) is a Northern Irish solicitor, legal scholar, and academic administrator.

According to this hypothesis, millions of years ago hominins left the woodlands that had previously been their natural habitat, and adapted to their new habitat by walking upright. The idea that a climate-driven retraction of tropical forests forced early hominini into bipedalism has been around for a long time, often implicitly. Some early authors saw savannahs as open grasslands, while others saw a mosaic of environments from woodlands to grasslands. The hypothesis has seen rising criticism since at least the late 1960s.Richmond, G. B., Begun, R. D., and Strait, D. S. (2001): 'Origin of Human Bipedalism: The Knuckle-Walking Hypothesis Revisited' in Yearbook of Physical Anthropology The open grasslands version is mostly dismissed, while the mosaic version still has relatively wide support, although the transition from forest to savanna probably was more gradual than previously thought. History The fundamental ideas behind it date back to Lamarck, Darwin and Wallace.Lamarck, J.B. de (1809): Philosophie zoologique, ou Exposition des consid√©rations relative √† l'histoire naturelle des animaux, DentuDarwin, C.R. (1871): The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, John MurrayWallace, A.R. (1889): Darwinism. An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection with Some of Its Applications, Macmillan and Co. Also Gustav Steinmann saw reducing rain forest due to climate change as important driver for bipedalism.Steinmann, G. (1908): Die geologischen Grundlagen der Abstammungslehre, W. Engelmann Osborn thought man probably originated from the forests and flood-plains of southern Asia.Osborn, H.F. (1915): Men of the Old Stone Age. Their Environment, Life and Art, Charles Scribner's Sons Hilzheimer stated it was open landscapes that stimulated development.Hilzheimer, O.J.M. (1921): 'Aphoristische Gedanken √ºber einen Zusammenhang zwischen Erdgeschichte, Biologie, Menschheitsgeschichte und Kulturgeschichte' in Zeitschrift f√ºr Morphologie und Anthropologie, 21, p. 185-208 The hypothesis first came to prominence however with the discovery of Australopithecus africanus by Raymond Dart in 1924. In an article on the discovery, published in the journal Nature, Dart wrote: Weinert stated apes are very reluctant to leave the safety of the trees, and the ancestors of modern man did not leave the trees, but the trees left them.Weinert, H. (1932): Ursprung der Menschheit. √úber den engeren Anschluss des Menschengeschlechts an die Menschenaffen, Ferdinand Enke Grabau echoed this by saying Instead of the apes leaving the trees, the trees left the apes.Grabau, A.W. (1961): The World We Live in. A New Interpretation of Earth History, Geological Society of China Not everyone agreed with this hypothesis, such as Weidenreich, but he did conclude it was a widely spread belief.Weidenreich, F. (1939): 'Six Lectures on Sinanthropus Pekinensis and Related Problems' in Bulletin of the Geological Society of China, Volume 19, p. 1-92 The work of Robert Ardrey helped popularize the ideas that Dart had developed with a wide audience. In the decades following Dart's discovery, more hominid fossils were found in Eastern and Southern Africa, leading researches to conclude that these were savanna dwellers as well. Much of the academic discussion at the time took for granted that the transition to the savannas was responsible for the emergence of bipedalism, and focused instead on determining particular mechanisms by which this happened. One of the proposed mechanisms was the knuckle-walking hypothesis; the claim that early human ancestors walked on all fours when they first emerged into the savannas. This was based on observations of morphological characteristics found in Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, and posited that knuckle-walking was an example of convergent evolution in chimpanzees and gorillas, which was then lost by the genus Homo. Paleoanthropologists also posited that the upright posture would have been advantageous to savanna-dwelling hominids, as it allowed them to peer over tall grasses for predators, or in search of prey. P. E. Wheeler suggested that another advantage lay in reducing the amount of skin exposed to the sun, which helped regulate body temperatures. The turnover- pulse hypothesis, first described by Elizabeth Vrba seemed to support the savanna hypothesis by suggesting that climate change events resulting in the shrinking of forested areas forced animals out into the open grasslands. Robinson investigated adaptive radiation for Australopithecus and saw grass savanna and other more arid environments expanding at this time, thus providing increased opportunity for animals capable of adapting to such conditions.Robinson J.T. (1963): 'Adaptive radiation in the Australopithecines and the origin of man' in Howell, F.C.; Bourli√®re, F. African Ecology and Human Evolution, Aldine, p. 385-416 Monod investigated the role in human evolution of the Sahara during wet periods as a place that was covered with steppes, savannas, and lakes. He saw advantages for the process of hominization in a wooded savanna.Monod, T. (1963): 'Late Tertiary and Pleistocene in the Sahara' in Howell; Bourli√®re, p. 117‚Äì229 In analogy with gelada Jolly proposed that [i]n the basal hominid, therefore, the 'gelada' specialisations would be superimposed upon a behavioural repertoire and post- cranial structure already attuned to some degree of truncal erectness. The transition to bipedality would have been instigated by seed-eating and would probably took place in a dambo-like environment, later shifting to wider floodplains.Jolly, C.J. (1970): 'The Seed-Eaters: A New Model of Hominid Differentiation Based on a Baboon Analogy' in Man, Volume 5, p. 5‚Äì26 An early critic of the savanna hypothesis was Lovejoy in 1981. He stated [i]t is more likely that hominids venturing into open habitats were already bipedal and that their regular occupation of savannahs was not possible until intensified social behavior was well developed.Lovejoy, C.O. (1981): 'The Origin of Man' in Science, Volume 211, Number 4480, p. 341-350 Kortlandt sought the barrier required for geographic speciation to take place. According to him, the Great Rift Valley, the Nile and the Zambezi acted as a double barrier when a period of desiccation set in East Africa. This must have converted the last-surviving dryopithecine (Proconsul) ape there into an upright-walking, drought-adapted, and \\"humanoid\\" type of bush and grassland ape, i.e., in all probability the Homininae, strictly speaking.Kortlandt, A. (1972): New Perspectives on Ape and Human Evolution, Stichting voor Psychobiologie This corresponded with the location of some important fossils that had been found until then, such as in 1939 the Australopithecus afarensis in Laetoli by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen and the Paranthropus boisei in the Olduvai Gorge in 1959 by Mary Leakey. This Rift Valley theory became known as the East Side Story by Yves Coppens.Coppens, Y. (1994): 'East Side Story: The Origin of Humankind' in Scientific American, Volume 270, no. 5, p. 88-95  Shifting consensus  In the latter parts of the 20th century, new fossil evidence began to emerge which called the savanna hypothesis into question. These newly-discovered remains showed indications that they were still well adapted to climbing trees, even after they had begun to walk upright. Both humans and chimpanzees tend to walk upright when moving along long branches of trees, increasing their reach. In 1993, 4.4 million year old fossil teeth were found in Aramis, Ethiopia, by a group led by Tim D. White attributed to a new species, Australopithecus ramidus, later called Ardipithecus ramidus. The age was thus half a million years older than previously known A. afarensis and had a more monkey-like appearance.White, T.D.; Suwa, G.; Asfaw, B. (1994): 'Australopithecus ramidus, a new species of early hominid from Aramis, Ethiopia' in Nature, Volume 371, p. 306‚Äì312 After extensive research, in 2009 in a series of eleven articles in Science, more was published about Ardi. It concluded that Ar. ramidus preferred more wooded areas instead of open grassland, which would not support the climate-driven savannah hypothesis.White, T.D.; Asfaw, B.; Beyene, Y.; Haile-Selassie, Y.; Lovejoy, C.O.; Suwa, G.; WoldeGabriel, G. (2009): 'Ardipithecus ramidus and the Paleobiology of Early Hominids' in Science, Volume 326, p. 75-86 A year later, these conclusions were questioned: In contrast, we find the environmental context of Ar. ramidus at Aramis to be represented by what is commonly referred to as ‚Äútree or bush savanna‚Äù with 25% or less woody canopy cover. The habitats involved probably ranged from riparian forest to grassland.Cerling, T.E.; Levin, N.E.; Quade, J.; Wynn, J.G.; Fox, D.L.; Kingston, J.D.; Klein, R.G.; Brown, F.H. (2010): 'Comment on the Paleoenvironment of Ardipithecus ramidus' in Science, Volume 328, 1105 For Phillip Tobias, the 1994 find of Little Foot, the collection of Australopithecus africanus foot bones demonstrating features consistent with tree-climbing as well as an upright gait, contributed to calling the savannah hypothesis obsolete, stating Open the window and throw out the savannah hypothesis; it's dead and we need a new paradigm.Vaneechoutte, M.; Kuliukas, A.; Verhaegen, M. (2011): Was Man More Aquatic in the Past? Fifty Years After Alister Hardy - Waterside Hypotheses of Human Evolution, Bentham Science Publishers In 2000 Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford found the 6 million year old Orrorin tugenensis in Kenya. The skeleton seems to indicate both bipedalism and good climbing skills. The latter indicates a wooded environment, as does the discovery of black-and-white colobuses. The discovery of impalas points more towards a more open landscape.Pickford, M.; Senut, B. (2001): 'The geological and faunal context of Late Miocene hominid remains from Lukeino, Kenya' in Comptes Rendus de l‚ÄôAcademie des Sciences, Series IIA, Earth and Planetary Science, Volume 332, No. 2, p. 145-152 It later led Senut to the conclusion that the savannah hypothesis was no longer tenable.Senut, B. (2015): 'Morphology and environment in some fossil Hominoids and Pedetids (Mammalia)' in Journal of Anatomy, Volume 228, Issue 4 If these fossils are indeed early ancestors of modern man, then the environment of the later Australopithecus is less relevant. In 2001 the 7 million year old Sahelanthropus tchadensis was discovered in Chad. Based on animal finds in the vicinity, this suggests a mosaic of environments from gallery forest at the edge of a lake area to a dominance of large savannah and grassland, although more research was needed to determine this precisely.Vignaud, P. et al. (2002): 'Geology and palaeontology of the Upper Miocene Toros-Menalla hominid locality, Chad' in Nature, Volume 418, p. 152-155 The 5.6 million year old Ardipithecus kadabba discovered in 1997 was found in a similar terrain.Su, D.F.; Ambrose, S.H.; DeGusta, D.; Haile-Selassie, Y. (2009): 'Paleoenvironment' in Haile-Selassie, Y.; WoldeGabriel, G. Ardipithecus Kadabba. Late Miocene Evidence from the Middle Awash, Ethiopia, University of California Press  Definition of savannah  Not everyone was willing to write off the savannah hypothesis. A poor definition of what a savannah actually is, contributed to this. Critics of the hypothesis often saw the savannah as open grasslands with sporadic tree growth. However, savannas can have a high tree density and can also be humid. The big difference between savannas and forests is the lack of grasses in the latter. Thure E. Cerling developed a method to determine the forest cover of ancient landscapes, thus no longer requiring a definition of what a savannah is. By distinguishing between the C3 plants of the tropical forests and the mix of trees and C4 grasses of the savannah, they investigated the stable carbon isotope of paleosols from some sites in East Africa. They described landscapes varying from forest, woodland/bushland/shrubland, wooded grasslands to grasslands. They concluded that the early hominini lived in a more open environment than Australopithecus, rendering the savannah hypothesis still a plausible possibility.Cerling, T.E.; Wynn, J.G.; Andanje, S.A.; Bird, M.I.; Korir, D.K.; Levin, N.E.; Mace, W.; Macharia, A.N.; Quade, J.; Remien, C.H. (2011): 'Woody cover and hominin environments in the past 6 million years' in Nature, Volume 476, p. 51-56 Following on from Cerling, Manuel Dom√≠nguez-Rodrigo stated that the usual division of landscapes into grassy, wooded and wooded is of little use, because it tells nothing about the evolutionary pressure on mammals. For example, the selection pressure of grass fields in tropical forests is incomparable to the grasslands of savannas. Tropical forests also have many different species of trees, while savannas only have a few species, which hardly carry any fruit. Another factor is that of scale. Paleontologists often only investigate the site itself, an area of several hundred to thousands of meters. These habitats are referred to as biomes, but the latter include many hundreds of kilometres. According to Dom√≠nguez-Rodrigo, the savannah hypothesis can still give a good explanation, although the transition of environment has probably been less abrupt than some earlier authors thought.Dom√≠nguez-Rodrigo, M.

Since October 2011, its interests have been undertaken by the Ministry for Equal Opportunities and Ecclesiastical Affairs. The Council consisted of a chairmen and eight permanent members representing the social partners, women's organisations and gender researchers.

The Council was increasingly criticized for its lack of impact, particularly in the 1999 report on Det fremtidige ligestillingsarbejde (Future Gender Equality Work).

Mind and Matter - Essays Scientific & Christian, 1951, chapter 1 This chapter provides rich insights into author's early experiences, such as growing up in an Anglican family, receiving Christian education, praying, learning the Bible, and partaking in various religious customs and traditions, all very typical of the times, place, and author's social class. However, despite these influences, Sherwood Taylor had great difficulties accepting faith and religion as they were presented to him. Realization that religion might lack rational foundation has severely swayed his views, and initiated an over 40-year long journey in quest of an ultimate verdict between religion and materialism. Along the way, the author has encountered themes such as mind and body, physical concepts of extension, mass, and motion, perception, superstitions, consciousness, spiritualism, qualia and many more, all having great influence on the author and contributing to his understanding of the world, but still not decisive. Sherwood Taylor's problem with materialism lied in its inability to account for mental experiences, and for the sense of \\"self\\" as a thinking entity. Additionally, scientific praise of determinism was hardly in line with Sherwood Taylor's belief in will and choice. Despite his great respect for science, the author started to find it increasingly difficult to believe that science could ever explain his life, thoughts, and experiences, his poetic, and mystic side, desperately searching for God. A pivotal turn took place, when F. Sherwood Taylor accidentally received a letter meant for a member of the Rationalist Press Association, asking to give a lecture on Galileo. Despite a mistake, Sherwood Taylor offered his services, and soon found himself an expert on Galileo's case. While investigating the matter, he came to the conclusion, that Galileo's story was full of deliberate distortions implemented by anti-Catholic and \\"rational\\" writers. This made him realize that science is guilty of all the offences usually assigned to Church - it's ill-founded, wicked, deceitful, and superstitious. Following this and other events, including hearing a voice in his head say \\"Why are you wasting your life?\\", F. Sherwood Taylor started to see Christianity as the purest and most intelligible of religions, offering so long-sought solutions to many countless problems of life. Additionally, his career in chemistry begun to feel uncomfortable, as it was contributing to a materialist worldview.Bowler, P., J. Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain, 2001, p. 42 He joined the Roman Catholic Church, and, although not without doubts, has made up his mind. The remaining of the book presents 12 essays, which are F. Sherwood Taylor's attempt at progressive, but not final, integration of the religious and scientific methodologies and ways of considering and understanding the world. = Essays = *The Deficiencies of Materialism *Science, Philosophy and Religion *Biology and Man *Evolution and Religion *The Problem of Pain in Nature *On the Excellence of Things *The Vocation of Science *The Place of Science in Christian Education *Some Moral Problems Raised by Science *The Church and Science *Mysticism, Christian and Pagan *The Catholic Layman and His Responsibilities Reception The book has been reviewed by Sister Francis Augustine Richey, who regards the author as \\"a distinguished scientist, a convert moreover from the fringes of scientism to catholicism, a writer with a singularly gifted mind, sensitive, imaginative, intuitive and logical\\".Richey, F., A. Man and Matter, 1954, College of Saint Elizabeth, Convent, New Jersey She states, that as a chemist and historian of science, Sherwood Taylor relies on experience, and writes from a position that emphasizes the appreciation of science. However, he does so in a thoughtful and critical manner, raising \\"an inspiring call into the battle against materialism\\". He engages in a careful analysis of scientific method and knowledge, and does so from an easily approachable objective perspective, which Sister Francis Augustine Richey calls \\"impersonally personal\\". She describes the book as valuable and illuminating for \\"teacher and pupil whether of science, philosophy, or religion\\".

The book comprises seven chapters, each dealing with a different kind of transient disturbance of consciousness, and it is meant to be a handbook for physicians, judges, prosecutors and defenders.Krafft-Ebing, Richard. Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins: Ein Beitrag zur Lehre vom transitorischen Irresein in klinisch-forensischer Hinsicht, f√ºr Aerzte, Richter, Staatsanw√§lte und Vertheidiger. Erlangen: F. Enke. (1868) At the beginning of each chapter, Krafft-Ebing introduces the general theme and discusses its relevance in a clinical-forensic context. He then precedes with the illustration of several case histories for each subsection. The book was reprinted and published by Hansebooks in January 2017. Context At the end of the 19th century, medicine and psychiatry was largely influenced by B√©n√©dict Morel's degeneration theory. Degeneration was seen as weakening of higher brain regions that would allow more primitive and uncontrollable behavior to emerge. Proponents of this world view were convinced that a process of devolution was taking place in society and that the causes of this decline were rooted within biological causes. Inspired by evolutionary theories of Darwin and Lamarck, European degenerationists increasingly believed that mental disorders were disorders of heredity and therefore biologically determined. According to Morel, degeneration could be caused by several factors, including intoxication, social environment or mental illness.Martindale, Colin. Degeneration, Disinhibition and Genius, Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 7: 177-82. (1971). Although Krafft-Ebing himself was said to be a liberal and progressive psychiatrist, in many respects he was still a child of his time. He was a loyal supporter of Morel's ideology and advocated the idea that modern civilization posed enormous demands on the nervous system causing impulsive malfunctions. In 1879, he published his \\"Lehrbuch der Psychiatrie\\" (English: \\"Textbook of Insanity\\"), which would soon become the German bible of degeneration theory. He believed that alcohol abuse or immorality would cause lack of voluntary control in higher order brain functions which would consequently lead to so called moral insanity. With beginning of the 20th century and the end of the victorian era, degeneration theory began to lose its popularity and slowly paved the way for a multi- causal framework of mental illnesses.  Content  The book comprises seven chapter, each devoted to a different altered state of consciousness and its sub-categories. At the beginning of each chapter, Krafft-Ebing defines each of those states and evaluates how they are related to each other. To underline his conclusions in regard to the clinical-forensic context, he presents several case histories that he calls \\"Beobachtungen\\" (English: Observations) at the end of each chapter. *I. Dream States: Krafft-Ebing sees dream states as the most frequent and most well-known altered states of consciousness.Krafft-Ebing, Richard. Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins: Ein Beitrag zur Lehre vom transitorischen Irresein in klinisch-forensischer Hinsicht, f√ºr Aerzte, Richter, Staatsanw√§lte und Vertheidiger. Erlangen: F. Enke. (1868). (pp. 2) During sleep, mental functions that are linked to our self-consciousness, like attention or conscious thought, are reduced or completely shut down while sensory input is blocked and motor commands are inhibited.Blackmore, Susan. Consciousness: An introduction. London: Hodder Education. (2010). (Chapter 22) At the same time, certain emotions lead to the production of sensory images that are experienced and perceived in this ASC. Somnolence, or drowsiness, refers to the state between sleep and wakefulness which is marked by reduced self-consciousness and apperceptive activity. Somnabulism, or sleepwalking, describes a state of low self-consciousness that is accompanied by the phenomenon of motor behavior in form of walking or talking during sleep. Due to the uninhibited triggering of motor movement outside of consciousness, actions performed in a somnambulate state are difficult to evaluate in terms of accountability for a crime and people may not be held responsible for their actions. *II. States of Intoxication: Alcohol intoxication is a physiological state induced by the depressant ethanol (alcohol) that reduces arousal and stimulation in several areas of the brain. Krafft-Ebing describes that the legislator saw such a drug induced state as self-inflicted and therefore, any unlawful action committed during intoxication should be seen as punishable. In contrast, physicians equated alcohol induced states with those of mentally ill individuals (for example psychosis), and according to them, unlawful acts should be evaluated in the same light as mental disorders.Krafft-Ebing, Richard. Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins: Ein Beitrag zur Lehre vom transitorischen Irresein in klinisch-forensischer Hinsicht, f√ºr Aerzte, Richter, Staatsanw√§lte und Vertheidiger. Erlangen: F. Enke. (1868). (pp. 26) *III. Acute Delirium in States of Fever: An increased body temperature can alter brain functioning that may lead to temporary ASCs expressing themselves in a delirium or hallucinations.Krafft-Ebing, Richard. Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins: Ein Beitrag zur Lehre vom transitorischen Irresein in klinisch-forensischer Hinsicht, f√ºr Aerzte, Richter, Staatsanw√§lte und Vertheidiger. Erlangen: F. Enke. (1868). (pp. 44) Affected individuals experience a state of emotionally frightening illusions that lead to acute states of anxiety and restlessness. Such a delirium is not insignificant in a forensic context, since there have been several cases reported in which feverish and delusional individuals committed a crime. *IV. The Big Neuroses: Mania epileptica comprises several mental states of epileptics that cannot simply be described by mania. Such states often resemble those of manic patients, but can also be characterized by melancholia or depression, which often lead to suicide, homicide, arson or other types of unlawful actions. Likewise, Krafft-Ebing describes hysteria and dysthymia as two further states of altered consciousness, though different in nature. While hysteria is primarily marked by manic symptoms, dysthimic individuals are in a state of chronic depression.American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.). Arlington: American Psychiatric Publishing. (2013). (pp. 168). *V. Transient Psychoses: Mania transitoria describes insanity of very short duration which may resemble the mania epileptica. In contrast to dysthymia, mania transitoria is more prevalent in males than in females and its onset is more sudden. In no less than 20 minutes to 6 hours the symptoms of mania transitoria may appear and alter the state of consciousness in a way that the individual fully loses the sense of self.Krafft-Ebing, Richard. Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins: Ein Beitrag zur Lehre vom transitorischen Irresein in klinisch-forensischer Hinsicht, f√ºr Aerzte, Richter, Staatsanw√§lte und Vertheidiger. Erlangen: F. Enke. (1868). (pp. 81) Another transient psychosis is raptus melancholicus, a term that has rarely been used in scientific or clinical discussions to date.Erkwoh, R. Psychopathological aspects of \\"Raptus Melancholicus\\". Nervenarzt, 80(7). Springer Medizin Verlag. (2009). Krafft- Ebing describes this altered state of consciousness as a state of extreme anxiety accompanied by symptoms of depression. Because affected individuals experience an intense feeling of restlessness, they see their only way in getting rid of this negative energy by committing a serious crime. Such crimes most often include murder, mutilation, vandalism or suicide. *VI. Pathological Affect of Sensory Confusion: Changes in physiological affect are a day-to-day phenomenon and according to Krafft-Ebing experienced by every individual.Krafft-Ebing, Richard. Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins: Ein Beitrag zur Lehre vom transitorischen Irresein in klinisch-forensischer Hinsicht, f√ºr Aerzte, Richter, Staatsanw√§lte und Vertheidiger. Erlangen: F. Enke. (1868). (pp. 99) To a certain extent, these changes in affect are controllable and the administration of justice should consider whether a committed crime was evitable or not. Pathological affect is hard to distinguish from this physiological affect. Such mental state may become pathological due to lovesickness, jealousy or despair. In such cases the judge alone cannot make a decision about the accountability for the crime and must consult a medical record of the accused. *VII. Transient Disturbances of Self-Consciousness in Parturients: During childbirth or in a short time frame after, a woman may find herself in an altered state of consciousness that may lead to infanticide.Krafft-Ebing, Richard. Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins: Ein Beitrag zur Lehre vom transitorischen Irresein in klinisch-forensischer Hinsicht, f√ºr Aerzte, Richter, Staatsanw√§lte und Vertheidiger. Erlangen: F. Enke. (1868). (pp. 114) In such cases, medical jurisprudence is of great importance, since medical evidence is often the only option to trace back the happening. These altered states of consciousness may be elicited by a huge amount of blood loss, anxiety or despair. Reception Richard von Krafft-Ebing had the reputation of being one of the leading psychiatrist of his day.Hauser, Renate Irene. Sexuality, Neurasthenia and the Law: Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840-1902). (1992) He was the author several leading textbooks in psychiatry and was especially known for his foundational work on Psychopathia Sexualis (1886) that had a wide and non-professional readership. Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins is one of his less well known publications and did not get much public reaction in academia or press. In many instances, it is not even listed as one of his official publications. Nonetheless, in 2002 the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel elected Krafft-Ebing as \\"Entdecker des D√§mmerzustands\\" (English: Discoverer of the Twilight-State), to which the work on Die transitorischen St√∂rungen des Selbstbewusstseins contributed the idea of altered states of consciousness. In 2016, Krafft-Ebings ideas on transitory disturbances of consciousness, especially epilepsy, were cited in an essay on \\"Transitorischer Wahnsinn\\" (English: Transitory Mania).Kassar, Johannes. Transitorischer Wahnsinn. Research Gate. (2016) Apart from that, most of the reviews on Krafft-Ebing's work concentrate on his publications on sexuality. That is because he soon shifted his attention from pre-dominantly lower socio-economic subjects of his asylum work to a different clientele.Bancroft, John. Review sypmposium: Krafft-Ebing, a hundred years on. Sexualities, 4(4), 497-509. (2001). Insanity defence in the 21st century Nowadays, criminal responsibility is usually presumed in cases of adult offenders. An indication for possible insanity defence can often only be given by a medical or psychiatric expert witness and is not solely based on the judgments of physicians, judges, prosecutors or defenders anymore. The evidence put forward by an expert witness is often a crucial judgment that leads to a well-informed and considered judgment. Further guidance is given by the German penal code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB). According to ¬ß21, a mitigation of sentence can be considered when an offender lacks insight due to one of the reasons stated in ¬ß20. These include morbid mental disorders, like psychoses due to alcohol intoxication, or disorders of consciousness that can be due to fatigue, somnolence or parasomnia. In such cases, the offender cannot be held fully responsible for the criminal offense despite posing a possible threat to society. According to ¬ß63 and ¬ß64, the inculpable offender has to be accommodated in a psychiatric hospital (German: Ma√üregelvollzug) in which they are primarily treated as patients, not criminals. The main focus of therapy is \\"Besserung and Sicherung\\" (English: \\"Recovery and Safety\\") and in contrast to a prison sentence, the duration of stay is individually determined by improvement in mental stabilization and rehabilitation. The treatment usually extends over several years and the requirements of legal dismissal are high. Dismissal on probation is only feasible with a clear and favorable forecast by several forensic experts, including psychiatrists and physicians.

Sex education in the early 20th century  The book was written during the time now called the Progressive Era, that marked the period between the 1880s and late 1920s. The progressive era was a response to the Second Industrial Revolution and the social problems that arose with it Library of Congress. Among other things, the progressive era saw changes in the way sex and morality were regarded. In the early 1900s the Victorian values were still prominent, regarding sex outside the marriage as immoral and sexual education as leading to moral misconduct. However, the flux of immigrants following the industrial revolution led to increased rates of prostitution. Additionally, instances of children and adolescence labor were on the rise, allowing the youth to gain information outside their homes, threatening the reliability and morality of the sex-related information.Valerie J. Huber Michael W. Firmin, A History of Sex Education in the United States Since 1900, International Journal of Educational Reform 23.1 , 2014, p. 25-51 These social problems called for changes in sexual education, hence, in 1912 and 1914 the National Education Association proposed the adoption of sex education in schools The topics in the Sexual Education of the Young Women reflect the post-industrial revolution problems. The author dedicated individual chapters to discuss prostitution and the health dangers it poses to the prostitutes and the society. Additionally, chapter \\"the working girl\\" deals with an issue of children labor and the lack of accessible education. The author also acknowledges that every young girl should be provided with sexual education, mirroring the concerns of the National Education Association. However, the sexuality of women was still conceived in the Victorian terms, as witnessed in the writings of Guernsey, where woman's sexuality was still regarded as sinful and immoral Johnson, Sadie, Danger in familiarities: sex education and adolescent sexuality in the early 20th century, Capstone Projects and Theses, 2012, p. 1-22. Similarly, Dr. David H. Keller names the virginity and prudence as the most valuable merits of a young woman. The idea that women sexuality is natural and normal finally became widespread with the rise of Sexual Revolution (1960-1980).Heer, D. M., & Grossbard-Shechtman, A., The impact of the female marriage squeeze and the contraceptive revolution on sex roles and the women's liberation movement in the United States, 1960 to 1975, Journal of Marriage and the Family, 1980, p. 49-65  Reception  David H. Keller was best known for his horror and science fiction writings. In turn, the non- fictional publications, such as Sexual Education of the Young Woman, did not receive prominent reviews . However, his work in fiction has obtained mixed opinions; some critics claimed that David H. Keller added to the development of science fiction genre, while others criticized him for a rather mediocre writing.David H.

Deutsche Bahn classifies it as a category 6 station and it has two platform tracks. The station is located in the network of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein- Neckar (Rhine-Neckar transport association, VRN) and belongs to fare zone 998. It was opened in 1911 as a junction station for the newly built Wieslauter Railway to Bundenthal. Its importance has always been as an interchange station between the latter and the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway, which has existed in its present form since 1895. After passenger services were abandoned at the station, it functioned exclusively as a depot for railway operations and as a freight yard. After traffic on the Wieslauter line was reactivated on weekends in 1997, it has again been served by passenger trains, but only in order for passengers to change trains to and from the main line. Therefore it is only served when the branch line is operating. Its address is Kaltenbach 15.  Location The station is located about two kilometres northeast of the built- up area of Hinterweidenthal. The Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway runs in this area from the east-northeast to the west. The Wieslauter Railway branches off parallel to this, but it runs down a slope to the lower valley of the Lauter. Federal highway 10 and the neighbouring Horbach stream also run parallel to both lines.  History During the building of the South Palatinate Railway (S√ºdpfalzbahn, now the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway), a railway station was built in the heights of the hamlet of Kaltenbach, which at that time was in the municipality of Wilgartswiesen. Due to its importance for the nearby municipality of Hinterweidenthal, the station was designated as Hinterweidenthal-Kaltenbach. In the meantime, plans were made to build a railway line in the Wieslauter valley. While some plans intended that such a line would connect to the main line at Kaltenbach, there was also support for the extension of the Winden‚ÄìBad Bergzabern railway, which was opened to Dahn in 1870. On the Bavarian side, there were plans for a line from Wissembourg (which had been part of Germany since 1870 and called Wei√üenburg) via Dahn and Lemberg to Pirmasens. Since this proved to be too expensive, the decision was taken to build a branch line. The station in Kaltenbach was found to be unsuitable for a junction because of its unfavourable topographical situation and as a result a new station was built two kilometres east of it, originally under the name of Kaltenbach Ost (east) at the junction to the branch line. The latter was opened together with the Wieslauterbahn (Wieslauter Railway) to Bundenthal-Rumbach on 1 December 1911. The opening train left the station at nine o'clock in the morning. During this time, the railway station was managed by the Zweibr√ºcken operations and construction inspectorate and its tracks were part of the responsibility of the Bahnmeisterei (track master's office) of Kaltenbach. As early as 1914, it was renamed Hinterweidenthal, while the station in the south of the municipality of Hinterweidenthal was named Hinterweidenthal Ort (place). It became part of the area of the Reichsbahndirektion (Reichsbahn railway division) of Ludwigshafen after the founding of the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1922. A year later, the railway workers employed at the railway station were expelled during the operation of the railway by the French military during the occupation of the Palatinate by France. They then returned to work. In 1935, the Reichsbahn equipped the train station with a signal box from the Bruchsal company and new signal technology. During the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, it was transferred to the railway division of Mainz on 1 April 1937 and the Betriebsamtes (RBA) Zweibr√ºcken (operations office of Zweibr√ºcken). = Further development = Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB), which was responsible for railway operations from 1949, assigned the station to the railway division of Mainz, which was assigned all railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Regular passenger traffic on the Wieslauter Railway was discontinued on 24 September 1966. The excursion train which ran on Sundays and public holidays, the Bundenthaler, remained as a concession to the local population who had vehemently protested against the decommissioning for the time being. The station was renamed again on 27 September 1970, this time as Hinterweidenthal Ost (east). Since then the station in Kaltenbach has been called Hinterweidenthal. The names of Hinterweidenthal Betriebsbahnhof (Hinterweidenthal operations station) or Rangierbahnhof ¬¥Hinterweidenthal (Hinterweidenthal marshalling yard) are also sometimes used. In the course of the gradual dissolution of the railway division of Mainz from 1 August 1971, its counterpart in Saarbr√ºcken took responsibility for the station. The Bundenthaler also stopped running in May 1976. Freight traffic ended on the Wieslauter Railway in 1995. Two years later the passenger traffic was reactivated on the weekend. Since then, trains have stopped at the station again. However, Hinterweidenthal Ost station is not served except during the times when the Wieslauter Railway operates. In 2000, the station became part of the Westpfalz-Verkehrsverbund (Western Palatinate transport association, WVV) along with the rest of the Western Palatinate; in addition, the tariff of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhine-Neckar transport association, VRN) was extended to the Dahn/Hauenstein/Hinterweidenthal area. In 2006, the WVV was absorbed by the VRN. Two turnouts in the station were renewed in October 2003; consequently rail traffic on the Wilgartswiesen‚ÄìM√ºnchweiler section was blockaded during this work. In April 2010, the same work was carried out on the main track, so all trains had to use the refuge track.  Infrastructure Substitute signal in the station = Entrance building= Since the station was only built during the construction of the Wieslauter Railway, the entrance building differs stylistically from its counterparts at the other stations between Landau and Zweibr√ºcken. It is side-gabled relative to the tracks and has a mansard roof as well as four dormer windows on the trackside. Already during its construction, it received a pedestrian subway, which still exists today despite the dismantling of most of the tracks. = Signal boxes= The station had two signal boxes, one in the eastern part of the station and one in the west. Meanwhile, they have been taken out of use. Since the 1990s, the signalling at the station has been controlled from Hinterweidenthal station, two kilometres west on the line from Landau to Rohrbach by means of a relay interlocking of the Sp Dr S60 class. = Tracks= The station initially had a total of six tracks. Among them were an overtaking track and four sidings. As a result of the abandonment of freight traffic in the mid-1990s, four of the six tracks were subsequently dismantled. Previously, the station had been primarily used to store freight wagons that were no longer required. Originally, it had semaphore signals, but these have been replaced by light signals.  Operations = Passenger services = Four train pairs were listed as running over the Wieslauter Railway each day in the first timetable. Due to its function as a railway junction, it was also a stop for express trains on the main line. In 1914, a pair of trains ran between Landau and Bundenthal-Rumbach, the predecessor of the later Bundenthaler excursion train. Moreover, in the morning a train continued to Munich and a through coach that had already run from Paris continued to Salzburg. On weekends, the services offered by the Wieslauter Railway were generally somewhat greater in the following decades. The Bundenthaler started in Ludwigshafen in the 1930s. During the Second World War, services on the Wieslauter Railway were discontinued from time to time, since it was within the Roten (red) zone (the militarised zone near the French border). There were trains on the main line at that time that sometimes ran only between Landau and Hinterweidenthal or between Pirmasens Nord and Hinterweidenthal. In the 1950s, a train ran between Landau and Hinterweidenthal as an express, serving only the stations of Landau West, Albersweiler, Annweiler am Trifels and Wilgartswiesen. On the rest of its route, it served all stations. At the same time, the station and the other minor stations on the line were served by long-distance services on the Munich‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken route. Local trains often stopped at the station for around ten minutes. As a curiosity, in the last years before its cessation, the Bundenthaler terminated, despite its name, in Dahn, where the passengers had to change to a train running to Bundenthal-Rumbach from Saarbr√ºcken, also running only on Sundays. In the first years after the reactivation of passenger services on the Wieslauter Railway on Sundays and public holidays in 1997, two pairs of trains operated, which were later increased to four. When the Bundenthaler was reactivated, it initially only operated from Neustadt. A few years later, its run was extended eastward to Mannheim. The train has since been divided in Hinterweidenthal Ost station; while one portion continues to Bundenthal-Rumbach, the other portion runs to Pirmasenser Hauptbahnhof. Trains of the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway only stop at the station at times when services run on the branch line. = Freight operations= A class I shunting locomotive was stationed in the station for freight operations before the Second World War. Since the station was assigned to the Saarbr√ºcken railway division in 1971, the freight traffic was served from Pirmasens Nord, which meant that freight trains had to reverse at the station to run on the Wieslauter Railway. Previously, freight traffic was served from Landau. The only exceptions were the tanker trains to the Hinterweidenthal tank farm, which ran from Karlsruhe via Landau. From the end of the 1980s, the local railway was increasingly rarely served and freight trains now run only to Hinterweidenthal Ort.

Back row l to r: Nora Kunfi, unknown, Gizella Fekete, Klara Kozma-Gl√ºcklich, Mrs. Fekee?, Laura Pol√°nyi-Stricker, unknown The Hungarian Feminist Association (, 1904‚Äì1942) was created by Rosika Schwimmer and Vilma Gl√ºcklich. The organization pushed for women's equality in Hungary in all spheres of women's life. In addition to pressing for women's suffrage, they drafted replies to modification of the marriage statutes and urged government response to address employment and training for women workers. History Both Vilma Gl√ºcklich and Rosika Schwimmer came from backgrounds of organizing and protecting women laborers and moved into the sphere of women's issues more generally. Developing contacts with the international women's movement, Schwimmer corresponded with women like Marie Lang and Adelheid Popp of Austria and Aletta Jacobs of the Netherlands. These prominent feminists urged establishment of a Hungarian women's organization which would bring the varied interests of other women's organizations into a united focus. Jacobs, in particular, urged Schwimmer to create an organization which would be admitted to the International Council of Women (ICW). She also urged her to attend the Congress to be held in 1904 in Berlin. Gl√ºcklich and Schwimmer both decided to go to the conference and were exposed to the support network and common issues international women shared. They returned to Budapest and founded the Feminist Association () shortly after their return. Almost immediately, the organization joined the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA) as the Hungarian affiliate. Vilma Gl√ºcklich holding the journal of Feminist√°k Egyes√ºlete, A N≈ë‚ÄîFeminista Foly√≥irat Gl√ºcklich was the acting managing director and practical adviser of the association, while Schwimmer, chaired the Political Committee and served as editor of the association journals. The goals of the organization were to address the socio- economic and political inequalities which affected women. They had strong ties and a friendly working relationship with Mariska G√°rdos, who headed the Hungarian National Association of Women Workers () While Women's Suffrage was one issue that the group strove to address, they were also concerned with equal pay, equal access to education, and civil and legal reforms to improve women's lives. FE also fought against the moral decay of society and child labor, providing lectures through a counseling program, \\"Select a Profession\\", which offered career guidance to young women. The program also provided educational materials to teach parenting skills which included lectures on sex education, children's health and education. In 1907, Irma Szirmai (also Szirmay) was placed in charge of the Mother and Child Protection Committee, which provided legal counseling, job placement services, stipends for day care, housing for refugees, and foster care placements. The organization founded two journals to educate women on issues and discuss feminist developments: Women and Society () (1907-1913) and Woman‚ÄîA feminist journal () (1914-1927). Eug√©nia Miskolczy Meller, one of the founding members, who substituted for Schwimmer when she was abroad, eventually replaced Schwimmer on the Political Committee in 1914. Meller drafted the FE's analyses of the marriage regulation reform for the 1913 Hungarian Civil Code, calling for gender equality and equal treatment. She was also one of the lead organizers of the 1913 ISWA conference held in Budapest and the 1916 Feminist Conference, which officials banned because the women were urging pacifism. That same year, FE urged the Parliament to address the issue of women's employment and training, as there were so many widows and wives of those injured in the war who had become responsible for being family wager earners. When Gl√ºcklich died in 1927, Szirmai took over her position as co-leader of FE, but had to withdraw due to a family situation, leaving sole leadership of FE under the direction of Meller. Melanie V√°mb√©ry served as the secretary of the organization from around 1913 until she removed to the countryside in 1938 to hide from the Nazis; she died in a concentration camp during World War II. In addition to their work in Budapest, the FE carried out organizational work throughout the country holding lectures and establishing branch associations. The organization was banned for pacifist activities in 1942, though secretly continued activities until May, 1944, when Meller was arrested and a few months later was sent to the Kistarcsa detention center. The last secretary of the organization, attempted to reorganize in 1946, but the FE was dissolved within the same year. In 1958, she donated the records in her possession to the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library, but as they were unable to preserve them, the library in turn sent them to the National Archives of Hungary the following year. A portion of the organization's papers are located within the Rosika Schwimmer Papers at the New York Public Library where she deposited them in 1920.

The author, a popular priest and doctor of theology, dedicated himself to working in an insane asylum in ViennaConstantin Wurzbach, 31 Biographisches Lexikon des Kaisertums Oesterreich, Kaiserl.-koenigl. Hof-und Staatsdruckerei, 1876, p. 163 and describes some of the cases he faced in his professional career. Sch√∂n wants to reduce the fear of the 'insane' and aims to create more understanding among the public for mental illnesses by giving short explanations of their various causes. Thus, his book is an attempt to bridge the gap between the common stigmas surrounding mental illness and professional psychiatric knowledge of the time.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 5 The focus of the book lies on giving funny and interesting examples, rather than on professional theories to keep the general public interested. It is thus a pioneer in giving information about mental illness, especially the symptoms of what is today known as schizophrenia. Content Table of contents of the book =Hallucinations and illusions of the senses= The author devotes a large part of his book to people suffering from hallucinations and illusions. As we know today, these can largely be attributed to being schizophrenic. Sch√∂n however oftentimes states that epilepsy is accompanied by such symptoms.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 60 He furthermore mentions that hallucinations are more likely to occur among people that indulge in alcohol and in flirtatious behavior with women. # Visual hallucinations: Among various cases with visual hallucinations, Carl Stein is described in particularly lengthy fashion. He is suffering from Alcoholism and reports seeing the devil in a particular corner of the madhouse corridor. The psychiatric diagnosis given is a goaded brain which apparently leads to a faulty excitation of the optic nerve, leading to the disturbed function of sight. # Auditory hallucinations: Sch√∂n's fellow psychiatrist Dr. Hagen explains different types of auditory hallucinations, grouping and characterizing the hallucinations into ‚ÄúOhrenklingen und Ohrensausen‚Äù (tinnitus) and ‚ÄúOhrenbrausen und Ohrenprasseln‚Äù (sounds likening the sound of a wheel or machine).Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 67 Furthermore, the reader is informed about the distinction between illusion and hallucination. According to the book, illusions occur due to a misinterpretation and altered perception of an actually existing sound, while hallucinations have no existing external origin and are caused by a faulty excitation of the auditory nerve.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 71 # Hallucinations of smell, taste and touch: Multiple cases are given regarding hallucinations of these senses. The causes are largely explained by functional physiological abnormalities.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 192 # Hallucinations of all senses: The case of Carl Stein is discussed again elaborately. It is stated, that his hallucinations extended to all senses over time. The patient believes he is obsessed with the devil telling him to kill himself. The man thus tries to commit suicide several times and is brought to Sch√∂n's mental home on several occasions. The author tried to cure the patient by using religious and moral lessons, which never helped. Finally, a metaphor brought the patient to his senses and made him realize the immorality and profanity of taking one's own life.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 124 This metaphor ultimately illustrates that one should not let the body and its urges (passions and addiction) take control over one's soul. =Various forms of madness= Multiple examples of simulating are given and discussed. Simulations of madness are performed to forego punishment after committing a crime. Another motive for simulating behavior includes wanting to prolongue the stay in a mental asylum out of comfort. With the presented cases, the public's misconceptions and faulty stereotypical knowledge about 'madness' are uncovered. Sch√∂n educates about how to identify 'fakes' and emphasizes that it is impossible to fake madness, even with professional knowledge.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 195 Moreover, sleep disturbances like sleepwalking and somnolence are described and different degrees of drunkenness are characterized. Consequently, the similarity of such states to madness is depicted in order to challenge the reader to put one's own sanity into perspective.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 181 =Kleptomania and pyromania= Even in the 19th century, the addiction to steal (kleptomania) was recognized by psychiatrists and Sch√∂n describes several cases of affluent members of society with this urge. Furthermore, there seemed to be an urge for arson (pyromania) among many mentally ill. Today, both mental illnesses are listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and are considered types of impulse control disorder. Psychiatric approach in the 19th century In the 19th century, a patient's constitution is described with the help of the different temperaments (sanguine, melancholic, phlegmatic and choleric).Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 220 This incorporation of the four temperaments in personality description reflects the maintenance of Hippocrates medical concept of humorism, which is no longer maintained in modern-day medicine. Physiology is emphasized as a primary cause of the disturbances of the mind. Sch√∂n states that the illnesses of the mind can never occur without illness of the body.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 200 Visual hallucinations, for example are said to occur due to a heating of the brain, happening when one hears tales and stories of superstitious content.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 56f Moreover, autopsies of the time apparently revealed anatomical differences in organs of the suicidal.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 308 This shows that psychiatry saw mental problems largely in the bodily organs and not in the content of the mind (thoughts). The prevalent stereotype of the time of insanity being infectious is thus rendered faulty.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 311 The book also states several motives for suicide; moral squalidness being identified as a main cause of such behavior.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 309 Relatedly, the theologically educated author observed that most of his suicidal cases aren't familiar with the Christian ten commandments, irrespectively of their educational status.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 310 Another statement made by Sch√∂n refers to the influence of emotions on the bodily organs. Anger is said to take hold of the liver and changes the blood circulation; anxiety and fear are stated to give blood a centrifugal direction and to attack the central organs. Sadness supposedly acts on the heart and the bladder. Meanwhile, bawdiness destroys the brain.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 316f This latter belief shows the emphasis of the time on moral chastity. Accordingly, the following recommendation is given to the reader at the end of the book: This is an advice to care for the conservation of the body and to abstain from all passions and urges. The book also reveals that 19th century psychiatrists with medical education cooperated with a priest in the healing process of the mentally ill. According to Sch√∂n, most of his cases suffer from lower moral and religious education and are undevout. Given his theological background, Sch√∂n thus stresses that a priest is responsible for the moral education of the patient and saintliness is seen as a way to protect oneself from mental illness.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 314 The inclusion of religious staff in the viennese asylum can be contrasted with additions of pathologists in other mental homes. John P. Gray (1825-1886), an American forensic psychiatrist and advocate of physical causes for 'madness', included pathologist staff in his American asylum in Utica. This made his asylum the first of its kind. Sch√∂n's descriptions and analyses mention both moral-religious and physical causes for mental illness. The book thus mirrors the century's dynamic and diverse view on mental illness. While Sch√∂n advocates the long-held moral causes for mental illness, he also acknowledges the necessity of physical causes. Additionally, the author's motive of creating more understanding for the 'insane' mirrors the trend of the 18th and 19th century of treating the mentally ill in a more humane manner. Despite this progressive aspect, the book can also be considered to reflect some old-fashioned, sexist tendencies. Women are said to be of a more nervous, neurotic temper which makes them more likely to suffer from hallucinations- especially from delusions of being a witch.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 172 Furthermore, the author comments that a female patient of his was more predisposed to lose her mind, as she was starting her menses at the time.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 106 Periodic menstruation and the beginning of menstruation in puberty are also mentioned to play a role in female suicide and arson-addiction.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 298 The latter was allegedly caused by ‚Äòdarker blood‚Äô, which was believed to be more prominent in menstrual women.Bruno Sch√∂n, Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter, Hartleben, 1859, p. 303 To conclude, 'Mittheilungen aus dem Leben Geistesgest√∂rter' can be considered a photograph of the century's knowledge and misconceptions about mental illness. The modern reader can expect to be entertained by the outdated and inaccurate views, as well as impressed by the authors wish to change the stigma surrounding 'insanity'. The novel manages to educate the reader about the development of psychiatry with the use of easy-to-read language and can thus be recommended to the general public and professionals alike.

It discusses major topics concerning school, work, law and their connections to psychology. The book aims at giving a short overview of how psychology can be applied to important areas in life. Erismann uses many applicable tests and describes them in great detail, thus providing a practical guideline on how to use the findings of psychology in different fields. Context The book was published during the First World War. The war is not mentioned in the book and there are no references that could be linked to the war. \\"Angewandte Psychologie\\" happens to be a book for a layman person who is eager to learn something about the latest contributions of psychology to different areas in life. Erismann was greatly influenced by Wilhelm Wundt and his experimental approach to psychology. During Erismann's time, psychology was a fairly new topic itself. Psychology gained popularity through Wilhelm Wundt who is also called \\"the father of experimental psychology\\" and founded the first formal laboratory for psychological research at the University of Leipzig.Tom Butler-Bowdon: 50 Psychology Classics. Nicholas Brealey Publishing 2007. . p. 2.Wundt: Das Institut f√ºr experimentelle Psychologie, Leipzig 1909, 118-133 Thus, Erismann adapted techniques and methods by Wundt to create and develop his own research. He therefore contributed important insights and findings to psychology. Content The book consists of 5 chapters. Those 5 chapters all discuss distinct topics and their connection to applied psychology. 1\\\\. Choice of work and the experimental-psychological testing of cognitive abilities (original title: \\"Berufswahl und die experimentell-psychologische Pr√ºfung geistiger F√§higkeiten\\"): This chapter mainly describes why people choose their work and whether those choices fit to their personality. Erismann illustrates with a few examples people who were lucky to find something they love doing, but also considers people who work at jobs they do not like and they are not good at. In this chapter, a guideline is provided on how to find something one is good at through the help of \\"experimental-psychological testing\\".Angewandte Psychologie. Band 774 von Sammlung G√∂schen.[774]. Theodor Erismann. G√∂schen, 1917. 159 pages. 1.Chapter 2\\\\. The School and the experimental-psychological testing of children (original title: \\"Die Schule und die experimentell- psychologische Untersuchung der Kinder\\"): In the second chapter, Erismann explains why it is of pivotal importance to already test children while they are still in school in regard to their cognitive abilities. Through using intelligence tests like the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale introduced by Alfred Binet and Th√©odore Simon, teachers can help their pupils to understand at a fairly young age what skills they possess and where their interests lie. Erismann points out that it is important to establish institutes that are specialized in placing people in suitable jobs concerning their interests, skills, and abilities. Those institutes should use specific tests based on experimental-psychological testing. Thus, reminding us of career centres which can nowadays be found in almost every city. An example of such a career centre would be the German \\"Bundesagentur f√ºr Arbeit\\".Angewandte Psychologie. Band 774 von Sammlung G√∂schen.[774]. Theodor Erismann. G√∂schen, 1917. 159 pages. 2.Chapter 3\\\\. Psychology and the Law (original title: \\"Die Psychologie und das Recht\\"): The \\"Psychology and the Law\\" chapter summarizes the findings of forensic psychology and how this knowledge can be applied in court. Erismann furthermore describes false memories and that they are not happening seldom but on a regular basis. Therefore, judges need to be aware of this phenomenon. Back then psychologists already examined the reliability of eyewitnesses' testimonies through different tests, e.g. the \\"Association-Test\\" (original name: Assoziationstest). Nowadays, the reliability of eyewitness testimonies often is questioned by the public and the law; hence, a lot of research regarding reliability of eyewitnesses' testimonies is being conducted. In Erismann's book, the viewpoint that children are not as reliable as adult eyewitnesses and more suggestible to false cues is supported. However, nowadays it is found that adults can be as suggestible to false memories as children. Sometimes, children even seem to be more reliable eyewitnesses than adults.Loftus, E. F. and Davies, G. M. (1984), Distortions in the Memory of Children. Journal of Social Issues, 40: 51‚Äì67. doi:10.1111/j.1540-4560.1984.tb01093.xAngewandte Psychologie. Band 774 von Sammlung G√∂schen.[774]. Theodor Erismann. G√∂schen, 1917. 159 pages. 3.Chapter 4\\\\. Psychology and the science of language (original title: \\"Die Psychologie und die Sprachwissenschaften\\"): The fourth chapter is rather a short one and illustrates how language and psychology can be combined. Erismann bases his explanations about linguistics on the \\"Analogiegesetz\\" (English: \\"The Law of Analogies\\"). This law describes the development of words and how some words seem to be more similar to each other than other words. Based on this law, people tend to build analogies between words and place them in similar categories having similar accentuations, an equal number of letters, et cetera. Erismann further explains that the phenomena of misspeaking a word or saying two separate words as one are a result of the law of analogies.Angewandte Psychologie. Band 774 von Sammlung G√∂schen.[774]. Theodor Erismann. G√∂schen, 1917. 159 pages. 4.Chapter 5\\\\. The importance of suggestion and hypnosis regarding other fields of knowledge and the practical implications for life (original title: \\"Suggestion und Hypnose in ihrer Bedeutung f√ºr die andern Wissensgebiete und das praktische Leben\\"): The last chapter deals with the suggestibility of human beings and how this is related to hypnosis. Some people are more easily hypnotised than others. If one succeeded to hypnotise someone else, the hypnotised person might be suggestible. The hypnotist is able to change and shape opinions, experiences, and events of other people and let the hypnotised people believe that the implanted memories are their own. This can be a powerful and a dangerous tool. Erismann also explains that suggestibility and \\"implanting\\" beliefs into the mind of other people is not only happening through hypnosis but can also happen if a charismatic leader is able to influence the masses. Erismann's field of expertise includes crowd psychology. Crowd psychology describes phenomena like the Second World War, especially Adolf Hitler's speeches, as well as when Martin Luther King Jr. mobilised the masses to march peacefully against racism and hate. The first event is a negative example of how one single person can influence the masses, whereas the second event a positive example portrays.Angewandte Psychologie. Band 774 von Sammlung G√∂schen.[774]. Theodor Erismann. G√∂schen, 1917. 159 pages. 5.Chapter Receptions of Theodor Erismann As there are no receptions or reviews of the book \\"Angewandte Psychologie\\" itself, the focus of this section will lie on Erismann himself. Theodor Erismann has been a rather popular psychologist during his life. He researched a lot on the topic of eyesight and blindness, especially with his colleague . Ivo Kohler himself wrote Erismann's memorial, which is published on the webpage of the University of Innsbruck where Erismann mainly worked during his academic career. His findings of the \\"Goggle Experiments\\" still are highly influential and relevant today.\\"The world is upside down\\" ‚Äì the innsbruck goggle experiments of theodor erismann (1883-1961) and Ivo kohler (1915-1985). (2017). Cortex, 1(1). doi:10.1016/j.cortex.2017.04.014 He published around a dozen books, which found great appreciation. Furthermore, Erismann was elected as the president of the Academic Society for Psychotherapy and Applied Psychology which thus underlines his great influence for psychology during his time. Erismann was not only perceived as a psychologist, but also as a philosopher. As Kohler put it himself: \\"Man w√ºrde aber Erismann unrecht tun, ihn nur als einen originellen Experimentator und Empiriker zu feiern, er war ein ebenso interessierter und leidenschaftlicher Philosoph.\\" (Loose translation in English: \\"Rather to only celebrate Erismann as an original researcher and empiricist, it is important to be aware that he was also an interested and passionate philosopher\\"). This suggests the variability and flexibility of Erismann.

In the story, \\"teresuko\\" is the name given to a fish, and \\"suterenkyou\\" is the name of this fish when it is dried. Plot At a particular fishing place, a strange fish was caught. None of the fishermen knew the name of this fish, so they brought it to the magistrate's office to find out. The officials at the magistrate's office also did not know the name of the fish so, after a discussion, they decided to put up a gyotaku and offer a cash reward to the person who could tell them the name of the fish. A man then came forward and said that the fish was called \\"teresuko\\". The officials were suspicious of this strange name, but since they had no way to confirm or deny it, they reluctantly paid the reward to the man. The magistrate heard this story, so he dried the fish out and made another gyotaku of it and offered a reward to the person who could name this fish. The same man came forward and said that this fish was called \\"suterenkyou\\". The magistrate was furious and immediately accused the man of committing the capital offence of trying to defraud the government. The man asked to see his wife and child one more time before he was put to death. When he saw his wife, he said to her, \\"When our boy grows up, make sure you don't let him call squid 'surume' when it is dried.\\" (In Japanese, raw squid is called \\"ika\\". Dried squid is called \\"surume\\". The man was making the point that sometimes there are different words for raw foods and dried foods, such as 'beef' and 'jerky'.) When the magistrate heard this statement, he acquitted the man of the charges and set him free. The wife had been fasting. This was a contemporary ritual to make a wish come true, in this case to save her husband from his death sentence. Since she had to feed a nursing child, she ate soba powder dissolved in water so that her milk wouldn't dry up, but only that, and abstained from any prepared (e.g. dried) foods. The \\"punchline\\" of this rakugo story is that the man's survival from the dried fish peril was no wonder, because his wife was (coincidentally) abstaining from dried foods.

Wijsman (1857-1928) was born in The Hague and studied in Amsterdam. In 1882, he became officer of health in the East Indies and worked as medical practitioner and director at the health establishment Sindanglaija. After this position, he came back to the Netherlands and became a school doctor in 1904. During the years Wijsman lived in the East Indies, he wrote the book Diagnostics for mind diseases as a manual for medical practitioners. According to him, medical practitioners had very little knowledge about psychiatry, and without this knowledge they could not examine and treat mentally ill people in a proper way. Structure The book contains ten lectures. These lectures make up the chapters of the book. The first chapter, which is called Aetiology. Medical examination (Aetiologie. Ziekenonderzoek), gives an introduction of possible causes for mental diseases and instructions for diagnosing these diseases. The next six chapters are about specific diseases, in each chapter a couple of related diseases are discussed: * hallucinations, illusions, affects, moods, delusions, hallucinational confusion and paranoia. * psychical feelings, psychical perverse feelings, idiocy and melancholy * mania, insanity, mental impairment, stupor and progressive paralysis. * senile dementia, deficient judgement, imbecility, idiocy and cretinism, obsessions and compulsions * chronic alcoholism, dipsomania and the working of alcohol by psychopathic predisposition * morphinism, opium and cocaine abuse, lead poisoning, physical changes because of phthisis pluminum, hysteria, epilepsy, organic brain diseases, lues cerebralis, psychical infection, children's crusade, dinomania, tarantismus. The next chapter is named Therapy, this chapter mentions treatments for mental illness in general and treatments for some specific diseases. The chapter thereafter is about the laws related to mentally ill people in the Netherlands and in the East Indies. Finally, the last chapter contains medical reports in Dutch, German and French and gives information about crimes and accountability in case of people with mental diseases. At the end, former mental hospitals in the Netherlands and the East Indies are listed. Contents =Aetiology. Medical examination= Wijsman mentions a couple possible causes for mental illnesses. Important are inborn or obtained predispositions for functional or anatomical changes in the brain. Life or work circumstances can stimulate these predisposition or can exhaust the brain. Exhausting the brain can evolve in nutritional disturbance in the brain, which can lead to functional or anatomical changes. According to the book, even masturbating can contribute to mental illnesses, because this should irritate the nervous system and therefore could stimulate a predisposition. A remarkable comment about these predispositions is that men should carry less predispositions compared to woman. Eventually, they will have just as much mental illnesses as woman, because men should be exposed to more difficulties in life. In diagnosing a mental illness, the medical practitioner has to look into the past of the patient, for diseases or life events of family members and to circumstances at the time of conception. Other good indicators can be facial expressions, handwriting or physical abnormalities. Especially skull abnormalities are important, therefore medical practitioners will often do a skull measure. For some specific diseases the book gives certain features in handwriting, facial expressions and skull measures. =Therapy= For treating a mental disease, the medical practitioner has to search for the cause of this disease. If the cause can be found, taking it away can help in case of a disorder caused by functional changes in the brain. If a patient suffers from anatomical brain changes, a surgical treatment is needed. If the cause cannot be found or cannot be taken away, the symptoms of the disease must be treated. The patient often has to get rest and can be taken out of his old environment. If it is really necessary to keep the patient in bed or to prevent masturbation, a straitjacket can be used. Appropriate nutrition is also important, meals have to vary and for some diseases a certain diet is needed. For example, a patient with mania has to avoid meat because this can irritate the nervous system. In case of food refusal a patient has to move as little as possible to reserve recourses and a stomach tube can be used. Other possible treatments are hydrotherapy, electrotherapy or massages. These can be used to stimulate the bowel movement or treat insomnia. A healthy bowel movement is important because obstipation can have a bad influence on mood. =Laws concerning mentally ill people in the Netherlands and the East-Indies= Registration form for use of coercive means A license is mandatory for establishing a mental hospital. Each mental hospital is kept under strict supervision and will get unsuspected inspections. Every use of coercive means must be noted in a register. In case of hospitalization, removing, leave, dismissal or death, a written announcement must be made. The patient himself, other people or justice can demand for hospitalization of a patient and permission is required before a patient can be hospitalized. With permission from the person who requested the hospitalization, the patient can go home for a short period of time. Dismissal from hospital can also be requested by the same person, if this person is not available, relatives or the city council can do it as well. If dismissal is requested, the medical practitioner will give an advice on this request and the final decision will be made by the court. One final striking law in this chapter states that if people are hospitalized because their mental illness, they lose most of the possessions they have. =Judicial-medical reports= The most common crimes done by mentally ill people are: murder, theft, arson and fraud. For some diseases certain crimes are very distinctive, for example; paranoia is associated with murder and idiocy with moral offenses. To decide about the liability in case of certain crimes, a mental examination can be done, which can change the sentence. A medical report contains the answers patients have given to questions of the medical practitioner, the impression the practitioner has of the patient and remarkable occurrences. The examination of genitals and skull measures is also mentioned. Further, it concludes the confession and explanation of the crime and the opinions of people who know the patient. At the end the conclusions of the examination and the continuation of the process are stated. Examples of these medical reports are included in the final chapter. Because mental illnesses are difficult to simulate, fraud is not very common. Simulating a disease is very exhausting and can be noticed fast. Moreover, some features are not to simulate, like changes in respiration or blood circulation. The book gives an advise in how to handle by suspecting fraud: ignore the person and if this does not work ask critical questions. If the person still won't budge, he can be placed in a mental hospital, because he will stand out eventually. Reception The book is reviewed in a critical way by Dr. Pierre F, Spaink in 1891. According to him, the book provides a better view towards mentally ill people, because at that time they were thought of in a bad way and often treated wrong. It is also very helpful for medical students, because it is clear written and gives a lot of information about different aspects of the psychiatry. Further gives the book good tips and warnings which can be helpful by treating mentally ill patients. Although the review is primarily positive, Spaink also gives some critics and recommendations. He has a strong opinion against the use of a straitjacket. He believes that it is not possible that a straitjacket can help with giving a patient rest, because they will always try to get rid of it and this gives a lot of agitation. Spaink also introduces some other possible causes for mental diseases which he thinks should be implemented in the book. Timeframe In the beginning of the book Wijsman mentions the wrong way mentally ill people have been treated in the past. At that time, they were not seen as people with an illness, but instead as people possessed by an 'evil spirit'. Clergy tried to drive this 'spirit' out of the body with painful 'treatments'. In the time the book is written, mentally ill people are more and more treated by medical practitioners instead of clergy. Mental disease were still named soul diseases, but were not anymore seen as diseases of the soul. The last years before the book is written, people started to believe that mental illnesses are caused by functional or anatomical changes in the nervous system, especially in the brain. Although the view towards mentally ill people began to change in this time, they were still seen as insane and weird by most people. People also had a really strong aversion against mental hospitals, which they named mad houses. In the book Wijsman introduces mentally ill people as people with a disease who need the right help. He believed that mental illnesses are brain diseases which produce psychical symptoms and encourages less harmful treatments, with as little as possible coercive means. This more positive view towards mentally ill people and their treatment became more present at the time of the book. It is possible that Wijsman contributed to this shift.

During the 1970s he played guitar and sang in the band Novos Baianos, after which he embarked on a solo career recording 29 albums.Pereira, Ian√° Souza. Ax√©-ax√©: o megafen√¥meno baiano. Revista √Åfrica e Africanidades, Rio de Janeiro, ano 2, n. 8, February 2010, p.02 Moreira was involved in recording 40 full-length albums with Novos Baianos and Trio El√©trico Dod√¥ e Osmar, and two more albums with guitarist Pepeu Gomes. Moreira was one of the most versatile composers of Brazil, mixing the genres of rock, samba, choro, frevo, bai√£o, and classical. Career =Novos Baianos= Moreira began playing the accordion in festivals at S√£o Jo√£o and other events in Itua√ßu, Brazil such as \\"Portal da Chapada Diamantina\\". In his youth he learned to play the classical guitar while taking a science class in Cacul√©, Bahia, Brazil. He moved to Salvador and there met Tom Z√©, and was also introduced to rock music. On meeting Baby Consuelo, Pepeu Gomes, Paulinho Boca de Cantor, and Luiz Galv√£o, they formed the band Novos Baianos, and were active from 1969 until 1975. Together with Pepeu Gomes, he composed almost all of the songs of the group. The album Acabou Chorare, released by the band in 1972, has been ranked by Rolling Stone Brasil as the greatest Brazilian music album of all time. =Solo career= Moraes began his solo career in 1975, and has since then recorded more than 20 albums. In his solo career, he was the lead singer in the trio Trio de Dod√¥ e Osmar, and recorded many popular songs associated with Brazilian Carnival, in what was conventionally called \\"frevo trieletrizado\\". Some of the hits during this part of his career include, \\"Pombo Correio\\", \\"Vassourinha El√©trica\\", and \\"Bloco do Prazer\\". During the 1980s he distanced himself from the Bahian Carnival due to increasing commercialization from tourism. In 1994 he recorded \\"Brasil Tem Concerto\\" which was influenced by classical music, and in the following year appeared in the MTV Brasil special Moraes Moreira Ac√∫stico MTV which was later released as a CD and DVD. In 1997, he recorded the album 50 Carnavais which commemorated his 50th birthday and 50 carnivals. Two years later, he recorded 500 Sambas (in honor of the discovery of Brazil 500 years before) which focused on samba music. In 2000, he released Bahi√£o com H, playing bai√£o with characteristic Bahian rhythms. In 2003, with the release of Meu Nome √© Brasil (2003), he completed his Brazil's themed trilogy, which, also, included L√° Vem o Brasil Descendo a Ladeira (1979) and O Brasil tem Concerto (1994). In 2005, he independently released the album De Repente, which mixed hip hop with Northeastern Brazilian influences and included his characteristic classical guitar swing rhythms. He published the book, A hist√≥ria dos Novos Baianos e outros versos (The History of the Novos Baianos and other verses), in which he told the history of the group in a chapbook and interesting aspects of his solo career. The book resulted in a Brazilian tour of the same name where he played his major hits and recited passages from the book. In 2009, it was released as a DVD and CD. In 2012, he recorded the album A Revolta dos Ritmos, a compilation of 12 of his unedited recordings. Death Moreira died on April 13, 2020, at age 72 from a heart attack.

The original piece was published in 1910 in German and includes psychoanalytic discussions from eight members of the society about the causes and explanations for the suicide of students. The eight members are Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Josef Karl Friedjung, Carl Furtm√ºller (pseudonym: Karl Monitor), David Ernst Oppenheim, Rudolf Reitler, J. Isidor Sadger and Wilhelm Stekel. The translation by Friedman was a project of the Library Committee of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute to give non-German speakers access to the historical document. Content =Timeframe= In the foreword written by Paul Friedman, the author stresses the historical significance of the document as it was one of the last meetings of the society. Giving an illustration of the Zeitgeist of 1910 he describes an \\"epidemic\\" of suicides among young students, partly due to the book The Sorrows of Young Werther written by Goethe. Furthermore, the author displays the time before 1900 as a deterministic philosophy where human behavior was attributed to outer abiding causes and was rationalized. According to Friedman, in the realm of psychiatry suicide was associated with mental disorders, caused by predisposing factors such as heredity. The etiology of suicide presented by the symposium on suicide is therefore seen as revolutionary in the author's eyes. Especially, topics such as psychosexual crisis, heterosexual and homosexual conflict, as well as an association between murder and suicide, went against the strong resistance of psychological thinking in the beginning of the 20th century. The preface was written by Alfred Adler on behalf of the society and gives further information about the members of the circle. He describes that the Vienna psychoanalytic Society met every week for seven years and is composed of physicians and psychologists, all applying the psychoanalytic method first used by Breuer. =Symposium on Suicide= David Ernst Oppenheim Oppenheim was an Austrian gymnasium teacher and a psychologist who starts the discussion by arguing that in the cause and prevention of suicide among young students, the least blame should be put on teachers. The educationalist argues that teachers have to observe too many children with not enough time and primarily focus on the intellectual abilities of the child. Despite having the time and resources for observation, the family of affected adolescents often do not notice or report the psychological conflicts of their child. Referring to an investigation of 320 suicide cases by Eulenburg, the psychoanalyst states that one-fourth of suicides among students can be attributed to a lack of ability in school. He argues that blinded by their ambition, parents often force children to attend school although students experience failures due to a lack of understanding. In his opinion, mentally and physically ‚Äúunfit‚Äù students should be dismissed from school. Oppenheim further notices that opportunities for self-destruction such as weapons or robes produce ‚Äúsuggestive excitation‚Äù in young people, luring them into an imitation of the suicidal act. In his opinion, children are more likely to imitate their environment and this effect is even further amplified by the details of suicides reported in the news. Sigmund Freud The neurologist does not share Oppenheim‚Äôs opinion on the responsibility of schools. He is of the opinion that teachers should be supporting students as surrogates of their families and fail to arouse their interest in life. Freud later ends the discussion by claiming that there is still not enough psychoanalytic understanding about the emotional processes and changes of the libido as causes of suicide. Rudolf Reitler Reitler diagnoses suicidal ideas as a mixed form of psychoneurosis, phobia of examination and obsessions of self-destruction. Apart from the examination anxiety, all other motives are unconscious to the student. The outset of anxiety is often not attributed to a specific object and is therefore often described as the ‚Äúfear of fear‚Äù. Unconsciously, the fear is caused by repressing a sexual urge leading to an unresolved sexual tension. The anxiety is then transferred to the social sphere namely the school environment. In Reiter's opinion students focusing completely on their anxiety and phobia of school will eventually commit suicide. Students that learn to release their sexual tension through masturbation, on the other hand, return to a healthy state. Josef Karl Friedjung The Austrian pediatrician and politician Friedjung illustrates the inadequacy of often obvious explanations for self- murder. He describes the suicide of a young woman interpreted by her parents as a reaction to her failed marriage but which was actually deeply rooted in the unrequited love to another man. Dr. Isidor Sadger The forensic doctor Sadger mainly addresses the deprivation from love as a main motive of student suicide. Sadger characterized puberty as a period of enormous need for love, emotional involvement, and sexual experiences. Unfortunately, this destitution of love is often misinterpreted by parents and teachers leading to students losing all interest in school and life in general due to a lack of affection. Finally, this perceived abandonment leads to their loss of all hope for love causing them to commit suicide. Wilhelm Stekel The physician Stekel, who committed suicide himself, touches on the association between suicide and murder. The guilt about the own sinful wishes of the death of family and teachers, which are elicited by feelings of hatred and revenge, arises the desire for punishment of oneself through suicide. Moreover, Stekel mentions that suicides often occur after ceasing from masturbation. Due to the view about onanistic acts in society many develop a disgust about themselves turning into a disgust about life in general. A possible solution is that teachers should show the child the richness of life and their independence from old imperatives and ethical or religious inhibitions. Dr. Alfred Adler The Austrian psychotherapist empathizes the similarity of suicidal personalities to nervous illnesses. According to him, suicide victims are mainly shaped by an inferiority complex from their early development. This deep-seated insecurity and anxiety causes them to overcompensate with extreme ambitiousness for success, attention, and support of others. Suicide lastly demonstrates the escape from the injustices of life and the ‚ÄúWeltschmerz‚Äù they had to suffer from. Carl Furtm√ºller (pseudonym: Karl Monitor) Furtm√ºller further supports Oppenheim's defense of teachers and stresses the problem of the ‚Äúprivilege system‚Äù and the coercion for obedience in society. Due to overcrowding of schools, students without parental connections need the best grades to find a good job. In this competitive environment, the success of a child receives more attention than their personal development. Under these conditions, especially the suicidal personality described by Adler suffers from bullying and failure. The lack of time of teachers leads them to ignore ‚Äúfailures‚Äù and defiant students. Reception *In 1968, Edwin Shneidman organized a meeting of the leading experts on suicide. The circle consisted, among six others, of Paul Friedman, and was meant to resemble the Symposium of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society on suicide in 1910 as it took the translation \\"On suicide\\" as a starting point.Shneidman, Edwin S, and Antoon A. Leenaars. Lives and Deaths: Selections from the Works of Edwin S. Shneidman. Philadelphia, PA: Brunner/Mazel, 1999. Print From the members of the meeting in Chicago, the American Association of Suicidology (AAS) was founded which aims to research and prevent suicide to this day. *The psychoanalytic ideas of Paul Friedman were further used in the case study of ‚ÄûVivienne‚Äú, a 14-year-old student who committed suicide in 1973. In their book, John E. Mack and Holly Hickler quote Friedman's opinion that parents and school authorities are partially responsible for adolescent suicides. *The ideas of the Symposium (1910) are still used to evaluate psychotherapy for suicidals as a current German psychology textbook shows.Borcsa, Maria & Wilms, Bettina (2012).

They are made up of members Joe Hodgson (Vocals), Jonny Hughes (Guitars) and Luke Harrison (drums). They released their first album physically and digitally on 14 February 2017 entitled Northern Powerhouse. The band's sound and musical themes address love, loss and life in industrial towns across the North of England, with guitarist Jonny Hughes telling one newspaper that the band try to write songs about things that they can identify with, residing and experiencing life in Northern, working class areas. Several reviews and articles on the band questioned the origin of the unusual name, with singer/songwriter Joe Hodgson explaining that the band had struggled for a name initially, but hoped that the name evoked a certain kind of person, or specifically a woman, who may have a story to tell. With the release of Northern Powerhouse, the band gained attention in the press and on radio after the MP for the Northern Powerhouse Andrew Percy commented on the album, stating that after hearing it he enjoyed it so he would try and mention it in Parliament if possible. The band described this as a \\"bizarre twist\\" due to the album's political themes of austerity and working class strife, explaining how they didn‚Äôt expect the demographic to be Conservative politicians, and expressed their surprise. The album received initial praise for its \\"dramatic, powerful vocals\\" and the way Hodgson's lyrics dealt with heavy subject matter with wit and variety. The sound of the band and the jangly guitars evoke comparisons to bands from the 1980s such as The Smiths and The Housemartins, while others likened the record to having an upbeat feel with an indie folk sound reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac.

After their parents died, her older brother took charge of the family, including their academic and religious education. Fall began her teaching career at the Nashville Female Academy. Charlotte Fall married Tolbert Fanning, a widower, on December 25, 1836. They moved to Franklin, Tennessee, where they ran a school for three years, from 1837-1839. Next they opened a school at Elm Craig near Nashville which they operated for two years. Then Charlotte and Tolbert went on an evangelism tour through the South They returned to Franklin and in 1845 opened Franklin College, operated by Tolbert, and an associated female school operated by Charlotte. Although technically separate schools, the men and women took part in some common sessions. The schools were closed during the American Civil War from 1861-1865. Shortly after reopening, a fire destroyed several buildings. The Fannings purchased nearby Minerva College and renamed it Hope Institute. They ran this school until Tolbert‚Äôs death in 1874.

It was founded in 1982 and includes over 40 public library systems in northeast Ohio. CLEVNET provides access to more than 12 million titles of books, movies, music and e-books. CLEVNET was also the headquarters for Ohio's virtual reference service, KnowItNow24x7, from 2001 to its closing in 2015. History The origins of CLEVNET date to the automation of Cleveland Public Library's card catalog in the late 1970s and early 1980s under Director Ervin Gaines in partnership with Data Research Associates (DRA). In an effort to share the capabilities of the online catalog with other libraries, Director Gaines invited other area libraries to connect to the new technology. Cleveland Heights-University Heights Public Library was the first library to express interest. In December 1981, an agreement between the two libraries was approved, and the Cleveland Heights‚ÄìUniversity Heights Public Library came online on December 1, 1982, officially launching the CLEVNET consortium.https://ohioauditor.gov/auditsearch/Reports/2015/Cleveland_Public_Library_14-Cuyahoga.pdf The original online catalog system ran from its inception in 1979 until a brief \\"shutdown\\" in 1990 for upgrades. The scope of the upgrade was outlined with additional details by a Letter To The Editor from Robert T. Carterette: \\"Clevnet is one of the largest library resource-sharing networks in the United States today, making 1.6 million titles available to public libraries throughout Northern Ohio... in addition to 4.2 million items owned by the Clevnet libraries, 1.6 million title records, 106,000 book order records, and 32,500 Union List of Periodical records must be processed, a total of 5.9 million. The system processes the 3.6 gigabytes of data.\\" In 2003, Cleveland Public Library, which administered CLEVNET, chose Sirsi as its new source for public library technology products and services. In 2009, CLEVNET member libraries, including Cleveland Public Library, were the first public libraries to offer e-books to download in the EPUB format. In 2016, CLEVNET made the decision to move its servers from Cleveland Public Library to the State of Ohio Computer Center (SOCC) in Columbus, Ohio.

Previously called the Department of Welfare, it was renamed in July 2000. The current Minister of Social Development is Lindiwe Zulu. The first Department was established in 1937, to regulate and subsidise existing private, non-governmental welfare services, while providing some additional services. The 1997 White Paper for Social Welfare noted that post-Apartheid South Africa had inherited social welfare programmes which were ‚Äúnot considered to be critical social investment priorities and were under- resourced‚Äù. The Department \\"endeavours to create a better life for the poor, vulnerable and excluded people in society\\". It is tasked with reducing poverty, promoting social integration, and creating conditions for sustainable livelihoods. The Department also conducts research that develops the social indicators necessary for programme implementation and public accountability.  South African Social Security Agency  The South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) is a national agency of the government created in April 2005 in order to distribute social grants on behalf of the Department of Social Development. The DSD has an oversight role over the Agency but no operational control over it. It was also designed to reallocate the function of social security from South Africa's provinces to the national sphere of government and reports to the Department of Social Development (DSD). Its current chief executive officer is Abraham Mahlungu. SASSA is a public entity in terms of Schedule 3A of the Public Finance Management Act. The key functions of the parastatal are related to the administration and payment of social grants: the processing of applications, verification and approval of applications, disbursement and payment of grants to eligible beneficiaries, quality assurance, and fraud prevention and detection. South Africa's social welfare recipients have grown from 3.8 million in April 2001 to 11 million in March 2006, and 17 million in 2017. = Types of grants = Social assistance is provided in the form of: * a child support grant; * older person's grant (a pension); * disability grant; * war veteran‚Äôs grant; * care dependency grant, for caring for a child with severe disability; * foster child grant; * grant- in-aid, for those who need a full-time caregiver; and/or * social relief of distress, a temporary measure for people in dire need, in the form of parcels or vouchers. Previously, all nine (9) provincial governments were responsible for the administration of social grants, but this created serious social delivery challenges especially the delay in the approval and payments of grants, possible fraud and corruption in the system, inhumane pay points facilities and huge administration costs in delivering social grants. In 2015, of the R155.3 billion given in social welfare, R53.5 billion went to pensioners; R47,8 billion to child support grants; R20.2 billion to disability grants; and R8.5 billion for other grants; with the remainder going toward management and administration. = Operation = In January 2012, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), a subsidiary of Net1 UEPS Technologies, was awarded a five-year, R10 billion tender to distribute social grants on behalf of SASSA from February 2012. A rival bidder, AllPay, challenged the procurement process in court; in 2014 the Constitutional Court found that irregular processes had been followed, and consequently declared the tender invalid, but suspended the order in order not to interrupt grant payments, and to allow SASSA an opportunity to initiate a new tender process. Each month, the National Treasury deposits the total amount to be paid out into a Nedbank trust account. Interest earned during this period goes to the state. All beneficiary accounts are held at Grindrod Bank. A grant recipient can withdraw their grant from any SASSA paypoint across the country, which carries no withdrawal charge, and which Net1 CEO Serge Belamont claims is more secure because of the biometric security checks on fingerprints; or from designated retailers such as Pick n Pay, which work with EasyPay, another company owned by Net1, to allow these withdrawals; or from ATMs. Moneyline, another Net1 company, provides loans to grant recipients. Umoya Manje, also another company owned by Net1, allows grant beneficiaries to buy cellphone airtime on credit. = Grants crisis = In December 2014, a ministerial task team concluded that SASSA itself should take over the paying out of grants. In 2015, SASSA issued a new tender but did not award it, opting instead to insource the disbursement of grants by 2017. In the 2015/2016 financial year, SASSA recorded additional, irregular expenditure on the CPS contract for the re-registration of grant beneficiaries because legal requirements had been circumvented. The then Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan advised the Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini to award a new contract to commercial South African banks and the South African Post Office (SAPO), and forego biometric identification, which contract requirement disadvantaged others bidders against CPS. However, this proposal was rejected on the grounds that the biometric system had eliminated fraudulent claims amounting to R2 billion annually; that further work to remove duplicate entries could save another R2 billion annually; and that SAPO did not have a banking licence, nor enough post offices to properly distribute grants. Dlamini expressed a desire to remain with CPS until SASSA was capable to take over, reasoning that this posed the least risk of SASSA defaulting on grant payments. She claimed that the process to distribute grants through SASSA was well underway, insisting that the Department was halfway through a four-phase plan which would culminate in 2019 with the handing over of the responsibility to SASSA. Dlamini claimed in 2017 that she had only become aware in October 2016 that SASSA was likely to be unable to take over grants payments from April 2017. SASSA estimated it would pay CPS about R3.5 billion annually under a renewed contract, between 52% and 59% more than it already did. SASSA later denied that it had done such estimation, and then claimed that it was a simple inflation-related adjustment, which was not true. Dlamini had been advised in October 2016 that the DSD was obliged to engage in competitive tendering, and could therefore not sign a contract with CPS; she was informed that the grants crisis was also not a justification to continue using CPS, since the emergency had been self-created; and she also received a legal opinion from senior counsel Wim Trengove that the extant CPS contract could not be legally extended since it had already been ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court. In December 2016, SASSA was also advised to inform the Constitutional Court of its predicament, \\"that it faced the highly irregular prospect of going into contract for another year with [CPS]\\". The Agency waited until 28 February 2017 to lodge a plea, which it immediately withdrew the next day, using a letter dated the previous day. In February 2017, SASSA told Parliament's social development portfolio committee it had come up short in attempts to find working solutions to pay social grants, and claimed that the only way to make social grant payments from April was to stick with the service provider whose contract had been declared invalid. SASSA's Zodwa Mvulane told Parliament at the start of March 2017 that legal complexities beyond its control had left the Agency with too little time to phase out CPS, stating that they \\"only had a year, from September 2015, to prepare for being a paymaster\\". However, SASSA only began to prepare for a post-CPS solution in December, \\"doing little or nothing until then\\"; a committee advising it had until then been ignored for years. While SASSA told Parliament it had not had enough time, it had also claimed before the Constitutional Court that it would not need CPS a year after the 2017/2018 financial year‚Äîcontradicting a letter by Dlamini, sent on 2 February, that stated CPS would no longer be needed at the end of 2019, and another letter sent a week later by SASSA chief executive Thokozani Magwaza, which claimed that the contract with CPS would only last until November 2018‚Äîboth longer than a year. The Black Sash Trust, through representation by the Centre for Applied Legal Studies, launched an application to the Constitutional Court, asking it to compel Dlamini and SASSA to take necessary measures to ensure the social grants system and its beneficiaries were protected when the CPS contract ended on 31 March. On 6 March 2017, the contract with Cash Paymaster Services was renewed, and the Constitutional Court's order of invalidity with regard to that contract again suspended, for another year. The Court held that no party had ‚Äúany claim to profit from the threatened invasion of people‚Äôs rights‚Äù but also understood that CPS could not be expected to deliver grants at a loss; it therefore ordered CPS to continue to deliver social grants at the same price it had contracted for in 2012. The Constitutional Court found that \\"the responsible functionaries of SASSA\\" had been aware from April 2016 that they could not comply with their undertaking to the Court previously that they would be able to pay social grants from 1 April 2017. The Constitutional Court held Dlamini primarily responsible for the crisis, with Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng saying there was no explanation for the incompetence displayed by her and SASSA. According to constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos, the Constitutional Court had concluded that SASSA and Dlamini could not be trusted to do their constitutionally mandated job to ensure delivery of social grants, and could not be trusted not to lie to the courts in the future. Between 2013 and 2017, the DSD spent R30 million on the costs of legal appeals involving SASSA. = Unauthorised deductions = In 2004, the DSD amended the Social Assistance Act in order to disallow anyone other than the beneficiary to deduct money from their account. However, 10,262 complaints about deductions were made between April 2015 and March 2016, and the DSD itself claimed \\"for the past two to three years\\" to have been fighting illegal deducations from social grants. Many of the unauthorised deductions were claimed by CPS to be repayment of non-existent Moneyline loans, and sales of airtime and electricity. In June 2016, SASSA, the Black Sash, and the Association of Community Advice Office (ACAOSA) laid criminal charges against the directors of CPS and Grindrod Bank, claiming that the two companies were not implementing amended regulations under the Social Assistance Act, which amendments compelled companies not to deduct money from social grant beneficiary accounts for financial services. The criminal charges were frozen until October, when Net1 was to receive clarity from a High Court as to regulations. In a founding affidavit lodged with the North Gauteng High Court, Black Sash asked the court to ring-fence social grant accounts in order to protect grant beneficiaries from exploitation or abuse, and to prevent companies from soliciting beneficiaries around SASSA paypoints‚Äîpractices which Black Sash and the DSD accused Net1 and its subsidiaries of encouraging.  Central Drug Authority  The Central Drug Authority (CDA) was established in 1992, under section 2 of the Prevention and Treatment of the Drug Dependency Act. Its key functions are to effect the National Drug Master Plan; advise the Minister of Social Development on matters affecting substance and drug abuse; and promote measures relating to the prevention and reduction of drug abuse.  Criticism  Since the 1990s, welfare services have been allocated 10% of the Department‚Äôs overall budget. According to researcher Lisa Vetten, pay increases for the Department's civil servants have been consistently higher than inflation for the past 10 years; these increases have shrunk the budget for provision of services, and have correspondingly diminished funding to the non-governmental organisation (NGO) sector. She argues underfunding has created a two-tier system of care, in which government services are considerably better resourced than NGO counterparts. Further exacerbating NGOs‚Äô situations is the Department's late payment of their subsidies.

Modern systems use level shifters to bridge domains between processors, logic, sensors, and other circuits. In recent years, the three most common logic levels have been 1.8V, 3.3V, and 5V, though levels above and below these voltages are also used. Types of level shifter Uni-directional ‚Äì All input pins are dedicated to one voltage domain, all output pins are dedicated to the other. Bi-directional with Dedicated ports ‚Äì Each voltage domain has both input and output pins, but the data direction of a pin does not change. Bi-directional with external direction indicator ‚Äì When an external signal is changed, inputs become outputs and vice versa. Bi-directional, auto-sensing ‚Äì A pair of I/O spanning voltage domains can act as either inputs or outputs depending on external stimulus without the need for a dedicated direction control pin. Hardware implementation Fixed function level shifter ICs - These ICs provide several different types of level shift in fixed function devices. Often lumped into 2-bit, 4-bit, or 8-bit level shift configurations offered with various VDD1 and VDD2 ranges, these devices translate logic levels without any additional integrated logic or timing adjustment. Configurable mixed-signal ICs (CMICs) ‚Äì Level shifter circuitry can also be implemented in a CMIC. The no-code programmable nature of CMICs allows designers to implement fully customizable level shifters with the added option to integrate configurable logic or timing adjustments in the same device. Applications of level shifters Since level shifters are used to resolve the voltage incompatibility between various parts of a system, they have a wide range of applications as well. Level shifters are widely used in interfacing legacy devices and also in SD cards, SIM cards, CF cards, audio codecs and UARTs.

Targeting \\"busy professionals,\\" the barber shop makes regular stops at company properties, where it is subsidized by them. History The company's founder and CEO, Kush Kapila, was inspired by increasingly popular mobile services such as food trucks and pet grooming. His idea for a mobile salon and barber shop won first place at the 2011 UCSD Entrepreneur challenge for a consumer product. After raising $185,000 of funding, Kapila retrofitted an Airstream trailer as a classic barber shop. Sterlings Mobile launched in 2012 in the greater San Diego area. By August 2013, Sterlings Mobile had a customer following of 1,300. While it started out just doing cuts, the company branched out in the first three years to be a full-service salon and barbershop for men and women, providing other services such as colors, shaves, and threading. By 2015, Sterlings Mobile had multiple Airstreams in operation. In 2016 Sterlings added the promotional tour and events division, wrapping the Airstream unit with brand images of companies such as Warner Bros. or Walgreens to provide promotional activities across the United States.

Rosenswig is a Mesoamerican archaeologist born Oct. 30, 1968 in Montreal, Canada. He earned a B.A at McGill University in 1994, an M.A. at the University of British Columbia in 1998 and Ph.D. in 2005 from Yale University. Rosenswig currently conducts research projects Mexico, Belize, and Costa Rica. His research explores the emergence of sociopolitical complexity and the development of agriculture. In 2006, he began teaching in the Department of Anthropology at the University at Albany, State University of New York. Rosenswig is currently the director of the Institute of Mesoamerica Studies (IMS) at UAlbany. Research =Chiapas, Mexico= Rosenswig‚Äôs work in Mexico has been concentrated in the Soconusco region of Chiapas Mexico. He began the Soconusco Formative Project in 2001 for his dissertation research which included settlement survey and excavations at the coastal site of Cuauht√©moc. The project addresses the role of Olmec inter-regional interaction and contributed data on long-term processes of agricultural origins and the development of social stratification for the Soconusco region. Rosenswig's current project in the Soconusco region is the Izapa Regional Settlement Project (IRSP) that began in 2011. This project provided the first settlement data associated with the Formative period kingdom of Izapa. The IRSP project developed lidar (light detection and ranging) maps of Izapa and surrounding regions. Together with archaeological survey this project established a better understanding of settlement patterns and the development of sociopolitical complexity for this region. Rosenswig also began excavations at Izapa in 2012. =Northern Belize= Rosenswig has conducted research in northern Belize for two principal time periods, the Mesoamerican Formative period and the Mesoamerican Archaic period (see Mesoamerican Chronology). Formative period occupation in northern Belize has been documented at the archaeological site of San Estevan, located in the New River region of Belize. San Estevan was occupied during the Middle and Late Formative periods. Rosenswig directed two seasons of excavation for the San Estevan Archaeological Project in 2005 and 2008.The project documented sociopolitical changes that took place in northern Belize during this period, including the origin of village life, the transition from horticulture to intensive agriculture, and the construction of the first monumental architecture in the area. Rosenswig‚Äôs current research on the Late Archaic period occupation of northern Belize was in the Freshwater Creek drainage. Seven Archaic period sites have been documented from which starch grains of domesticated plants and lithic tools reveal adaptive patterns of these early horticulturalists. This research explores to origins of agriculture and settled life and the influence of the 4.2k BP Event as acting as a catalyst for the end of the Archaic period in Mesoamerica. =Costa Rica= Together with Ricardo V√°zquez Leiva, of the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, Rosenswig is also co-director of archaeological excavations at the site of Las Mercedes located on the property of EARTH University. Rosenswig and V√°zquez‚Äôs research at Las Mercedes investigates life at this chiefly center, occupied from AD 1000-1500. Rosenswig runs undergraduate archaeological field schools to Las Mercedes, including trips in 2009, 2012, and 2017.

Point-of-care testing is designed to provide diagnostic tests at or near the time and place that the patient is admitted. POCT uses the concentrations of analytes to provide the user with information on the physiological state of the patient. An analyte is a substance, chemical or biological, that is being analyzed using a certain instrument. While point-of-care testing is the quantification of one analyte from one in vitro (e.g. blood, plasma or urine) sample, multiplexed point-of- care testing is the simultaneous on-site quantification of various analytes from a single sample. Processing of one biological sample to yield multiple biomarker results allows for POCT testing to be done for patients who may have conditions that require the confirmation of multiple biomarkers and tests before diagnosis (e.g. many types of cancers). xPOCT has important emerging applications in resource-limited settings, (e.g. in the developing countries, in doctor's practices, or at home by non experts) xPOCT has recently become more important for in vitro diagnostics.  Background  Historically, medical testing has been a tedious, long and expensive process in a clinical setting. It usually involves taking a large sample from the patient (e.g. urine, blood, saliva, tissue swab), and processing it in a separate laboratory, which takes hours or sometimes days to complete. In that time frame, the patient needs to be provided with care, which is not favorable to do without the desired information from the laboratory test. As far back as the 1950s, radioimmunoassays were first demonstrated for the sensitive detection of insulin and thyroxine levels in human plasma. In the 1990s, research that was being conducted in the microelectronics industry was applied to the design of immunoassays and since then the applications for immunoassays have expanded. There has been a movement towards quicker, more simplistic and cost effective technologies that require small amounts of biological substances to yield results. This movement has been dubbed as microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip technology and aims to bring the results of a test accurately, quickly, and conveniently back to the patient with low cost and complexity to ensure the best patient care. Multiplexed point-of-care testing aims to do all of these things, but with multiple biomarkers at once. Microfluidics refers to the study and control of very small amounts of liquids and lab-on-a-chip is an electronic chip that is usually about 3 square millimeters that has the ability to perform various laboratory like capillary electrophoresis and PCR.  xPOCT technology characteristics  An ideal device for multiplexed point- of-care testing should offer high sensitivity and the capability to process one sample using multiple types of tests. It should be capable of testing various kinds of substances, including proteins, drugs, RNAs and cells, at the same time. A high sensor performance that requires small samples, short turnaround times, low system complexity for non experts, and low cost are some characteristics of xPOCT technology. Especially for the resource-limited settings (developing countries, doctors offices, directly at home), equipment- free or smartphone-based devices are very advantageous. xPOCT devices has to fulfill the following: * Low sample consumption (e.g. blood from a finger prick) or the ability to measure in noninvasive samples (e.g. saliva, urine or exhaled breath condensate) * Fast sample-to-result times enabling an immediate treatment * Long shelf life with extended reagent storage *Ease of storage * Comparable test results with central laboratory findings ensuring international quality standards (ISO 15189) * Automatic or facile system operation with minimized user intervention * Cheap and portable readout systems (e.g. handheld readers) along with disposable test strips or cartridges fulfilling the in vitro diagnostics guideline (EU Directives or FDA regulations).  Technologies  Multianalyte detection is mostly achieved through three different approaches but the technology mainly aims to use a single or small set of biological samples to split or separate them to be read by various types of assays: # Regional separation employing distinct sections of a channel network or array of electrodes # Spatial separation of detection sites with the help of various wells or spots # Application of multiple labels such as enzymes, redox molecules, beads, and dyes Other xPOCT devices use mass spectrometry (MS) to directly identify biomarkers for example, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS to rapidly identify pathogens, but devices that use this technology tend to be bulky and difficult to use. For the signal readout, optical and electrochemical detection methods are mainly employed. Current types of diagnostic devices that are being used are: * Paper-based systems - Lateral flow assays like pregnancy tests, which use samples that react with colored particles and require the device to read the color signature * Array-based systems - Devices with electrodes or fluorescent molecules in them that are sensitive to certain analytes * Bead-based systems - Systems that use beads as a material for the analytes to bind specifically to and those complexes are subsequently filtered or separates by size or color, for example bead based flow cytometry  Benefits and challenges  xPOCT has incredible benefits and applications for the healthcare and technology. It allows for a more cost effective, more rapid, portable, less painful, less complex yet accurate technology that can be used to test for indicators of conditions that previously required multiple samples and several hours or days to do. In addition to its implications in the clinical setting, the low complexity and portability of many multiplexed point-of-care test devices allows for its use by non experts at home both for those who require at home health monitoring systems and for other personalized medicinal uses. The incidence of false positives or false negatives seem to be low. Reaching the optimal space of high performance and low complexity, cost, and size has some challenges. Scientists, hospitals, manufacturers, and policy makers must ensure that the data gathered from these devices would be secure, and that the devices and the materials used in conjunction with it remain affordable and safe. In addition to these things, the devices themselves should be functional for long periods of time and should find ways to deal with their sensitivity to patient to patient variations, and the environment (humidity, temperature etc.).  Future research  Current research that is being done regarding xPOCT is focusing on making the requirements for something to be considered a xPOCT easier and cheaper to obtain. Scientists are working to make multiplexed point-of-care devices smaller, more portable, and affordable. Research is also being done on the maximum number of analytes that can be tested at once, if smartphones are a good device to use to present the results of a test, and could there be a device that allows a patient to wear a xPOC device that continuously monitors biomarkers of interest.

Note that Italian and Venetian, like most Romance languages, lack the sound. * > in some contexts. = Other sound changes = * Word-final consonants are sporadically lost in Arbanasi.  Morphology  Non-standard imperatives: \\"art!\\" for the imperative of vij (\\"to come\\", likely derived from the root of the past tense erdh- and/or the past participle ardhur, while the present tense is a partial borrowing from ancient Latin). In Standard Albanian, this would be \\"eja!\\".  Syntax  Romance influence is seen in the use of constructions of b√´j ‚Äòdo‚Äô + infinitive. The infinitive is constructed in the standard Gheg fashion using me (\\"with\\").Matasovic, Ranko (2012). \\"A Grammatical Sketch of Albanian for students of Indo-European\\". Page 42-43  Lexicon = High frequency of loanwords = * Arbanasi contains a number of words borrowed directly from Venetian: buti, shtrancata, shola, shoto (cf. Italian sotto) etc. * Loans from Croatian penetrate into the functional vocabulary: da (Croatian for 'that') used for that instead of Albanian q√´ (which itself is thought to be a Latin loan), bash \\"just\\" (instead of Albanian vet√´m \\"only\\"). * Other loans from Croatian: kral (\\"king\\", Croatian: kralj; Standard Albanian: mbret or Gheg regj, both from Latin), milo (\\"merciful\\", semantic shift from Croatian mila \\"dear\\"), quditum \\"astonished\\" * Loans from Italian rather than Venetian are also present: for example, apena (\\"as soon as\\") from Italian appena, inveqe (\\"on the contrary\\") from Italian invece . * Loans from Italian via Croatian : kantat \\"sung\\" (Standard Albanian: k√´ndoj, itself a Latin loan).  Sociolinguistics  The ancestors of Arbanasi people are Catholic Albanians who originated from the southern shore of Lake Shkod√´r and fled the Muslim ruled Ottoman Empire to avoid circumstances of military service and to due to religious discrimination or conversion to Islam. The Arbanasi arrived to Venetian ruled Dalmatia and settled on the outskirts of Zadar on lands provided by landowner Erizzo, in 4 neighbouring villages and in the towns of Kotor, Dubrovnik and Zemunik. All other Arbanasi were assimilated, except in Zadar where a settlement formed that they called Arb√´nesh (for the Italians Borgo Erizzo, for the Croats Varo≈° Eriƒçina), later becoming known in all local languages as Arbanasi. Arbanasi speakers have assimilated a large number of former Chakavian Croatian speakers who settled among them historically. Arbanasi speakers are usually bilingual in Croatian, and historically they were trilingual, also speaking the Venetian language. Various factors contributed to the generational transmission of Arbanasi Albanian by Arbanasi speakers. One, was an oral tradition were Arbanasi Albanian was spoken at social gatherings, often attended by women who recited folk stories. Another, was the sense of community awareness and linguistic difference from the more numerous surrounding Croatian speakers. Lastly, in situations of mixed marriages where a non-Arbanasi spouse from the area would be taught Arbanasi Albanian after becoming part of an Arbanasi household. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, Dalmatia was under Hapsburg rule. The establishment of a primary school in 1896 resulted in some Arbanasi receiving a mainly Italian language education with some Croatian and two weekly lessons in Arbanasi Albanian. Another primary school existed teaching mostly in Croatian and in 1901, it made learning Arbanasi Albanian obligatory for students who had it as a mother tongue. After World War One, Zadar became part of Italy and during the interwar period, Arbanasi Albanian was at first tolerated and in later years banned from being spoken and taught in school. Zadar was incorporated into communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and Arbanasi Albanian was not taught by the school system. The Arbanasi dialect, once spoken by much of the community and served as a significant identity marker has nearly disappeared among the Arbanasi, due to the historical and political stigmatisation of Albanian in the former Yugoslavia and the recent period of globalisation. In independent Croatia, for some years the language did not receive encouragement until the 2010s. Arbanasi Albanian is currently endangered and fewer than 200 speakers competent in the language exist. An additional 500 people can understand it to a certain degree. Apart from a few publications like the journal Feja and collections of Arbanasi lore, the language is not written. In studies of speakers of Arbanasi Albanian, they stated to researchers that the language in Croatia is not stigmatised and they have not encountered issues due to speaking it. Arbanasi who speak Arbanasi Albanian mostly have a positive view of the language. Most Arbanasi speakers acknowledge the connections of their language with Albanian, however they stress the unique features of their language and independence from modern standard Albanian. Among Arbanasi people that recognise Albanian origins, they view their language as an Albanian dialect, as opposed to a language in its own right. Arbanasi born in the Italian interwar period have a higher likelihood to positively view Arbanasi as Albanian and connections their community share with Albania. Other Arbanasi that hold the position that they are only Croats also accept that their language is \\"a part of the Albanian language\\". A more common view among Arbanasi is that the Arbanasi language was historically linked to Albanian and over time it differed due to borrowings from Italian and Croatian. Among the Arbanasi community, some have expressed concerns that they \\"need to beware of modern Albanian\\" and that cooperation with Albanians needs to be limited so the literary aspect of the Arbanasi idiom has an opportunity to develop. Arbanasi people that recognise their language as a type of Albanian Gheg feel that words should be drawn from it to fill gaps or substitute borrowed Italian and Croatian words used for objects or concepts of the modern period. Not all Arbanasi agree that the language should be taught, as some see it as a language of the private sphere among community members, whereas some others view the language as lacking the means for linguistic transmission. The teaching of Arbanasi is overall seen as a positive step by the community, although some prefer it is taught in a school course as opposed to a full school curriculum. In Croatia, there are recent attempts to salvage Arbanasi Albanian from language death. In 2016, standard modern Albanian was introduced as an optional language class in a Zadar high school in the neighbourhood of Arbanasi with the assistance from Albanian, Kosovo and Croatian authorities. Support exists among the Arbanasi for teaching standard Albanian at the high school for the national Albanian minority of Croatia. Some Arbanasi feel that the move is a political gesture by the Croatian government that is provocative as it misunderstood their needs of being a distinct community with a unique language. Some community members contest teaching standard Albanian as a substitute for Arbanasi, as they prefer it develops on its own terms, and discussions have centered upon possibly teaching the language outside the formal education system to keep it alive.

It explores the prevalence of gangs in society and in prisons and offers recommendations for solving post- apartheid gang violence. Overview The author writes that he spent nine months of research at PollsMoor Prison Admission Center. There he interviewed the prisoners, most of whom were awaiting trial. For an 18-month period he interviewed about 30 veterans members of gangs. During the 1980s and 1990s all of them served their sentences in prisons throughout the Western Cape. According to Steinberg, The Numbers Gangs take their inspiration from the historical figure Nongoloza Mathebula, born Mzuzephi Mathebula, who became the founder of The Number Gangs in South Africa. An early Johannesburg bandit, he built a quasi-military band of outlaws, welding his small army together with a simple but potent ideology of banditry-as-anti-colonial-resistance.

Darmst√§dter Signal is an independent organization (military watchdog group) opposing weapons of mass destruction and the primary use of military means to solve conflicts.Lothar Liebsch: Frieden ist der Ernstfall. Die Soldaten des ‚ÄûDarmst√§dter Signals\\" im Widerspruch zwischen Bundeswehr und Friedensbewegung. Jenior, Kassel 2003, It was founded in 1983 as a group of officers, soldiers and civil Army employees of the German Bundeswehr. According to its mission statement, the organization respects the German Army's role-defending the country within the existing legal framework, but strives to give critical feedback about the Army's mission and alternative non-military concepts of conflict resolution. The Darmst√§dter Signal sees the central task of the Bundeswehr in defence of freedom and democracy as basic principles of the country. History The organization had been founded during September 1983 in Darmstadt by 20 officers and lance sergeants. Main point of criticism in the appeal ‚ÄûDarmst√§dter Signal ‚Äûwith peace-political content was the deploy of new nuclear weapons/missiles in the middle of Europe as a consequence to the NATO Double-Track Decision. Until today, the working group claims the removal of weapons of mass destruction and of the US nuclear weapons in Germany. Supporters of the DS founded on the 15th of March 1986 the development association of the DS. Today 130 members belong to the working group and 200 supporters are organized in the development association. Annually, two to three workshops and public meetings take place to define positions and to draw attention to new developments by talks and lectures. Several former Federal Ministers, active und former members of the German Federal Parliament/Bundestag as well as several former Generals of the Bundeswehr are members of the development association. Spokesmen of the development association were Horst-Eberhard Richter, Gernot Erler und Konrad Gilges. Since autumn 2013, the retired General-Surgeon Karl Wilhelm Demmer is in this function. Goals On the basis of the principle of Inner Leadership (= leadership & participation & education) (Innere F√ºhrung) with its corollary of the citizen in uniform Rose, Juergen. Demokratisierung der Bundeswehr als Schritt auf dem Weg zum Frieden. (Staatsbuerger in Uniform) the \\"Signalers\\" use their fundamental right of free speech also in public and contribute to assure that the norms and values of the German Basic Law remain embedded in the Bundeswehr. The concept of Innere F√ºhrung was introduced during the early years of foundation of the new German armed forces after World War II and especially advocated by Lieutenant General Wolf Graf von Baudissin.It is a hallmark making the difference between Bundeswehr and Wehrmacht. Important goals of the Working Group are the removal of nuclear warheads and the democratization of armed forces. Darmst√§dter Signal does not reflect a general or official image of the mood and opinion in the German armed forces. The 25th anniversary of the organization was celebrated in the House of History in Bonn with a laudatio by Egon Bahr. For 27 years, Helmuth Prie√ü had been the spokesman of the Signal.

The book outlines Horner's theory for being able to resurrect a maniraptoran dinosaur by altering the genes of a chicken embryo. In 2010, a paperback version was published under the title How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution. Summary Paleontologist Jack Horner describes evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) and outlines his theory for being able to resurrect a maniraptoran dinosaur from a chicken embryo, by activating and deactivating certain genes to restore dormant dinosaur characteristics such as a tail, claws, teeth, and a snout. Horner also discusses paleontology in the book. Background and publication Horner's idea for the \\"Chickenosaurus\\" project came from \\"a pretty good script\\" that was written for Jurassic Park IV early in its development. The film's story, at that time, was expected to involve genetic engineering of dinosaurs. Horner was planning the book with co-author James Gorman in spring 2005. Gorman was deputy science editor for The New York Times, and had previously co-written Horner's 1990 book, Digging Dinosaurs. Horner and his publisher planned for the book to come out at the same time as Jurassic Park IV, to serve as a scientific companion volume; however, the film was delayed. Horner's book, in hardcover form, was ultimately published by Dutton Penguin on March 19, 2009, without the accompaniment of the film. The book was initially published with the title How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever. A paperback version was published by Plume on February 23, 2010, with the title How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution. Reception Publishers Weekly called the book \\"provocative but frustrating\\", writing that aside from the main concept, \\"Much of the rest of the book offers background, but often digresses, for example, into hunting for DNA from 68-million-year-old dinosaur bones or the surfing habit of the man who discovered the polymerase chain reaction or how genetically close humans and Neanderthals are‚Äînone of which advances the book's central argument.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote that the book \\"has a comfortable, intelligent flow,\\" but noted that Horner first \\"wants to tell a story‚Äîand it's a good one, though at times meandering‚Äîabout paleontology [‚Ä¶]. Horner digresses about skinheads, Ted Kaczynski and chicken carcasses, but his main idea is reverse evolutionary engineering.\\" Gilbert Taylor of Booklist wrote, \\"Straight from the scientific frontier, Horner's work should excite anyone who's dreamed of walking with dinosaurs.\\" Brian Switek of Smithsonian wrote, \\"The importance of How to Build a Dinosaur does not lie in Horner's wish to create a dinochicken. That makes up only a small part of the book. Instead the slim volume indicates how paleontology is becoming more of an interdisciplinary science where studies of development and genetics are just as important as fossilized bones.\\" Jeff Hecht of New Scientist wrote that Horner \\"is at his best\\" in the book, which he called \\"provocative yet firmly grounded in science.\\" References Category:Dinosaur books Category:2009 non-fiction books Category:Science books Category:Dutton Penguin books ","title":"How to Build a Dinosaur"},{"id":"53950561","text":"Barani is the capital of the Barani Department of Kossi Province in western Burkina Faso.

Wattenberg are the authors. The AEI Press (in-house publisher for the American Enterprise Institute) published the book. Unusually for a companion book to a documentary film, the book does not follow the synopsis of the film and does not include much of the narrative material. Instead, fifteen chapters provide a dense array of time series data and interpretive essays about American society in the 20th century. The companion volume has become a standard source of reference material about America in the 20th century.

This notable political shift has been a central question in Political Economy and has conventionally lead to two competing explanations: (1) Civil Rights caused racially conservative whites to leave the party and (2) economic development in the South made Democratic redistributive policies unattractive. They find evidence that defection among racially conservative whites explains most of the decline in white Democratic identification among Southerners from 1958‚Äì1980, which lends credence to the Civil Rights attitudes over the economic development hypothesis.

Early life  Gatti was born on 3 January 1875 in Montalto Pavese, Italy. He was one of eleven children born to Paolo Gatti, a local councillor and magistrate, and Maria Nascimbene.  Personal life  In 1902, at St Luke's, Hammersmith, Gatti married Edith Kate Cheese, the daughter of steward William James Cheese and his wife Emily of Chelsea. They had a son Luigi Victor, \\"Vittorio\\" born in 1904. In 1902, they were living in Hammersmith, in 1911 in Great Titchfield Street, Marylebone, London, and in 1912 in Southampton.  Career  Gatti owned and ran two restaurants in London, Gatti's Adelphi and Gatti's Strand.  Olympic and Titanic restaurants  Gatti was already running the √Ä la Carte restaurant on the RMS Olympic, and because of its success, Titanics √Ä la Carte was even larger, able to seat over 150, with over 60 staff, mostly Italian and French, all employed directly by Gatti, who ran these restaurants as concessions. For Titanic's maiden voyage, both Gatti and his head chef on Olympic sailed to ensure the new restaurant's success. Only first class passengers were permitted; they had to book tables in advance and pay a supplement to the first-class fare which included full board in the first-class dining room. Even into the 1890s, dining in public was not considered socially acceptable by some in the upper classes, especially the nobility and \\"old money\\", so it was felt necessary in effect to further divide the first class passengers. There was also a reception area for pre-dinner drinks, and a Caf√© Parisien designed to appeal to Americans. The √Ä la Carte restaurant used different china and silver plate from the main first- class restaurant.  Death  Gatti went down with the ship, dying on 15 April 1912.Luigi Gatti, sul Titanic un master chef dell'Oltrepo. Roberto Lodigiani & Pier Angelo Vincenzi, la Provincia Pavese, 3 April 2012.

During World War II, she was part of the first group of United States women to fly military aircraft, which they did in a war zone for the civilian British Air Transport Auxiliary. She was later a member of the civilian contract labor Women Airforce Service Pilots. After the war, she taught instrument training in Brazil. When President Harry S. Truman authorized the integration of women into the military, she served with Women in the Air Force and was based in Texas, Alabama, and finally London until her death. Raines was the first woman in Georgia to earn a pilot's license, and has been inducted into both the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame and the Georgia Women of Achievement. Early life She was born in Waynesboro, Georgia on April 21, 1916, to Frank and Bessie Raines, into a family that already included sisters Frankie and Martha. Raines pursued her dreams of flying in spite of being born with an unspecified heart condition and chronic asthma. She graduated in 1936 from Wesleyan College, a liberal arts school founded a century earlier as the Georgia Female Institute. What is known about her early training and experience is gleaned from the 1996 biography Hazel Jane Raines: Pioneer Lady of Flight written by her niece Regina Trice Hawkins, through her access to personal letters inherited by the family upon the 1971 death of Bessie Raines. She took her first aviator lessons at Herbert Smart Airport in Macon. When she earned her pilot's license in 1938, it earned her the distinction of being the first woman in Georgia to do so. Thereafter, she worked as a stunt pilot at local aviation shows. World War II =Civilian Pilot Training Program= As conditions led up to World War II, the United States joined European nations in strengthening its armed forces, which included the training of civilians for participation in the country's defense. The experimental Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) had been operating since 1938, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Civilian Pilot Training Act on June 27, 1939. The legislation contained a key provision from Illinois congressman Everett Dirksen, \\"none of the benefits of training or programs shall be denied on account of race, creed, or color\\", and opened the doors to people who would not otherwise have been eligible in the segregated armed forces that existed at that time. The \\"redtails\\" of the Tuskegee Airmen were a direct result of that program. And for the first time, women were being trained as pilots in large numbers. Within its first year, the program qualified 2,500 women as pilots. By the time it ended in 1944, 435,000 men and women had qualified as pilots at 1,460 flight schools, and 1,132 colleges and universities. Receiving her flight instructor's rating in 1941, Raines became an instructor with the CPTP program in Georgia and Florida in 1942. Besides being an instructor, Raines held a commercial pilot's license, had a documented 1,300 hours of flying time, and was a member of the Ninety-Nines, the Macon Aero Club and the National Aeronautical Association. =British Air Transport Auxiliary= Pioneering American aviator Jacqueline Cochran was at that time involved with recruiting women for the British Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) Ferry Pool Service, 14 individual pools of pilots in England and Scotland who were civilian contract employees to the Royal Air Force. The escort fighter aircraft used to accompany bombing raids over Germany were transported from one air base or squadron to another by the ATA. They employed both men and women, with the latter being 16% of the force. Requirements for both men and women were similar but had some key differences. Women pilots were accepted at a slightly younger minimum age, had an education requirement of completing high school, and needed two letters of reference. The male pilots had no education or reference stipulations for their service. Even though Raines modestly joked about being \\"a two bit flight instructor\\" for the CPTP, Cochran was sufficiently impressed with her credentials in 1942 to schedule an interview in New York, that resulted in Raines being accepted into the Ferry Pool Service. Training commenced at White Waltham Airfield, during which each pilot was each given a set of Ferry Pilots‚Äô Notes on index cards, instructions on how to fly any plane they were assigned to, whether or not they had prior experience or knowledge of any particular plane. Raines and the 24 other female American flyers working for the Ferry Pool Service during that period established themselves in aviation history as the first women from the United States to fly military aircraft, and they did it in a theater of war. To fly undetected by enemy radar, they used no navigational instruments, made no radio contact while flying, and had no ammunition for defense if the enemy spotted them. During her service with the ATA, Raines flew numerous types of British escorts, including the Hawker Hurricane, the Supermarine Spitfire, and the de Havilland Tiger Moth. She survived a March 2, 1943 crash landing at Collingbourne Kingston when her Spitfire's engine malfunctioned, landing atop an English cottage. Although the cottage was severely damaged, but there were no casualties. The Spitfire lost its wings, Raines managed to pull herself out of the plane and followed the ATA instructions on securing the aircraft, commanding \\"London ‚Äì guard that plane!\\", before being transported to a medical facility. Her head and eye injuries were severe enough for a mandatory medical leave from flying. She resumed her duties in June, flying Airspeed Oxford and Fairchild 24 planes, but was unable to wear a helmet due to ongoing issues with her injuries. Raines left the ATA with the rank of Captain, and returned to the United States in August. =Women Airforce Service Pilots= The United States Army Air Forces had begun to use women pilots as civilian contract labor in 1942. When Cochran returned to the US, she headed the Women‚Äôs Flying Training Detachment (WFTD). Aviator Nancy Harkness Love was named head of the Women‚Äôs Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS). The two groups were combined under the directorship of Cochran in 1943 to form the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), with training at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas. Prior to her return to the United States, Raines and some of the other women pilots had received a letter from Cochran crediting them with laying the groundwork for the creation of the WASPs. In November, Raines joined the WASPs and was made squadron commander at Avenger Field, completing her training ahead of schedule after learning to fly the Martin B-26 Marauder. Her next duty stations were as squadron commander at Pecos Army Air Field in Texas, and Kingman Army Airfield in Arizona. Both Cochran and Love lobbied for the WASPs to be fully militarized as a branch of the armed services, thereby giving the women not only recognition for their services, but also the same government benefits as the men. Their efforts were unsuccessful, and the WASP program ended on December 20, 1944. Final years Plaque of Raines at the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame Raines found herself at loose ends after the WASP deactivation, despite having logged 6,400 flying hours in her career. She was unemployed with no health care or retirements benefits to sustain her, and her heart condition was deteriorating. She spent a year teaching at the Air Ministry of Brazil in S√£o Paulo, where she used the Link Trainer, a type of flight simulator, for pilot instrument training. In the United States, she was respected for her accomplishments and was invited as either a speaker or honored guest at conferences and public events. Nevertheless, she wanted to have an active part in aviation. When President Harry S. Truman signed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, women were accepted as part of the US military, albeit limited to 2% of the forces. In 1949, Raines was commissioned in the Women in the Air Force (WAFS) as a Second lieutenant with the reserves unit at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Through determination and nonstop efforts to be recognized, Raines was finally returned to active status in 1950 and stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Raines served in administrative capacities before being transferred to London, from where she was dispatched to several European locations.

It was noteworthy as a Free Company which was created by and largely made up of Italians. It was formed in Ossaia, Italy in August 1362 by the condottiere Niccol√≤ da Montefeltro, together with Marcolfo dei Rossi and Ugolino dei Sabatini. It recruited dissatisfied Italian fighters serving the city of Florence and the name of the new group stemmed from their practice of hoisting their caps in the air in protest. Originally numbering some 1000 Italian, Burgundian and German knights, the company was led by Niccol√≤ da Montefeltro. In 1363, the company was in the service of Florence, for whom they fought against the towns of Pisa and Siena and the White Company. However the enemy's militia, comprising 800 knights under Ors Orsini, surprised Montefeltro's company and captured and imprisoned the latter with 1,300 of his men. After this defeat, the company was broken up and dispersed, many of the men accepting service in neighbouring Perugia. In 1365, after a period of inactivity, the company joined with the Compagnia di San Giorgio and fought against Florence, Siena and the Papal State.

Her career spanned over fifty years and left an \\"indelible mark on Qu√©bec theatre, film and television\\". She is a four-time recipient of the G√©meaux Award; three times for Best Lead Actress and once for Best Supporting Actress. She was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2005 and an Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2011. Early life Lafontaine was born on 8 June 1939 in Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec.

Life  The house of Dorothea and Niklaus von Fl√ºe in Fl√ºeli- Ranft Dorothea Wyss was born around 1430/32 in Obwalden. At the age of about 15 she married Niklaus von Fl√ºe who was about 15 years older. Niklaus was often on his way as an adviser, but also as a warlord during the 1450s and 1460s Swiss wars. After twenty years of marriage and 10 children, her husband claimed that God calls him. Dorothea initially categorically rejected her husband's request. Kl√§usli, the youngest child, was born some months before. Gradually, however, she took part in the vocation of her husband and gave her consent. On 16 October 1467 Niklaus von Fl√ºe left his family as a pilgrim. Directed by visions, he soon returned and settled in the nearby Ranftschlucht, the gorge on the Melchaa, a stone's throw from his family's home. Dorothea now was responsible for the house, the farm and her family. She took care of her husband's family tasks, and the education of the younger children. The two older sons managed the farm. Dorothea occasionally went down to the hermitage of Bruder Klaus (von Fl√ºe's then popular name) to talk with him about domestic things or the education of the children. She personally convinced herself that her husband has found his inner peace. When her husband died in 1487, she was supposed to be there. Dorothea should have allowed her husband to leave the family and start his life as a hermit, but the contemporary sources provide only rudimentary data. In 1488 she was described in the oldest biography of Bruder Klaus as a godly and extremely pious woman. Her first name is first mentioned in 1501, and around 1529 her surname in the female form Wyssin was first mentioned.  Literature  * Werner T.

It is on land that once formed part of the Lambeth Wick estate. Myatt's Fields North and South estates were built between 1970 and 1984 with 470 homes on the North and 324 on the South. In recent years it has been the subject of a dispute between residents and Lambeth Council, who have tried to replace the boiler system that serves Myatt's Field South, and Myatt's Field North estate, which has since been redeveloped as Oval Quarter. History The area to the West of Myatt's Fields Park suffered considerable bomb damage during the Second World War, with the area of Mostyn road being extensively damaged and a V2 rocket levelling buildings on Lothian Road where it meets Calais Street. The estate was designed by Lambeth Council by a team of architects led by Roger Westman and Ted Hollamby. Hollamby had been employed as senior architect at the London County Council from 1949 to 1962, where he led the design of the Brandon Estate in Kennington. He then left to work at London borough of Lambeth, where he was director of architecture, planning and development from 1969 to 1981, and for whom he designed Myatt's Fields South and North. Hollamby also designed Cressingham Gardens and Central Hill Estate, both of which are currently proposed for redevelopment. Description The estate is built of slate and brick blocks over parking undercrofts. It is formed of 354 dwellings, including 8 designed for severely disabled people, and 15 refurbished Victorian houses on Loughborough Road. The new build houses cater for a mixture of housing types, with a ring of apartments above garages at the perimeter of the estate, and town houses and terraces arranged around pedestrian footpaths inside. These are a maximum of 3 storeys high, with living rooms and bedrooms facing away from the noise of the surrounding roads. The green spaces within the estate were intended to form part of a \\"parkway\\" of public open space parallel to Brixton Road. Church on Mostyn Road prior to the construction of the estate. Ted Hollamby contracted Edmund Happold from Ove Arup & Partners to advise on structural engineering, contributing to the development of Central Hill estate, West Norwood Library and the subterranean boiler house at Myatt's Fields which was designed to heat both North and South Myatt's Fields estates. The boiler house has a design that led to it being called 'HMS Hollamby', and more recently, 'The Submarine'. The North part of Myatt's Fields estate was redeveloped in 2013-15, as its design was believed to contribute to anti-social behaviour, and the garage space was underused as a result of car ownership being less than predicted in the 1970s.

The company was founded as the publishing division of Blue Juice Films, Inc in 2012. Most of its publications were initially conceived as film or animation ideas. History In 2005, Thomas Mumme, Adam Miller, Michael Misconi, and Jeremy Schneider used their freelance experience in television and film to establish Blue Juice Films, Inc in Orlando, Florida with the intent to create short films, music videos, and feature films. They were successful with the first two goals, but were unable to get funding for their feature film ideas. Meanwhile, the group members were still freelancing outside of Blue Juice Films. In 2011, Mumme and Schneider were working on AMC‚Äôs Comic Book Men television show with Brooklyn-based screenplay writer R.F.I. Porto. This project gave Mumme the idea to try using comics as a proof of concept for feature film proposals. Blue Juice Films reviewed some of Porto's unsold screenplay ideas, selecting the science fiction idea The Accelerators to publish as a comic.Bradley, Drew (February 24, 2015), \\"Small Press Publisher Spotlight: Blue Juice Comics\\", Multiversity Comics.

Two of the hosts, Mike Zapcic and Ming Chen, also host a comic-themed podcast called I Sell Comics!, where they invited Blue Juice Comics to give weekly updates on the development of their new company and comic. Over the course of a year, the episodes covered their progress and missteps as they moved from script to finished product. These updates were paired with social media updates that showed the artwork as it progressed from pencils to a finished page. Blue Juice also polled its Facebook followers to see what a fair price for a small- press comic is. Although it did not have a comic to sell, Blue Juice had a promotional table at the 2012 New York Comic Convention.

He has performed under several personas during his career including Ash Rubinsky, Bull Bronski, Face of Fear Ash, Dami√°n and Superstar Ash. Concepci√≥n has wrestled in all of the major local promotions winning the IWA Caribbean Heavyweight Championship, IWA Junior Heavyweight Championship and IWA World Tag Team Championship in the International Wrestling Association (IWA), the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship, WWC World Tag Team Championship and WWC Television Championship in the World Wrestling Council (WWC) and the WWL World Heavyweight Championship in the World Wrestling League (WWL). He has also been regularly active in the independent circuit, making appearances in New Wrestling Stars (NWS), where he held the NWS Tag Team Championship and NWS Television Championship, CWS, NWG and 100% Lucha where he won the tag team titles. Currently, the leader of the interpromotional West Side Mafia stable, he has been involved with several stables during his run, including Los HPs, Faces of Fear, Los Templarios and El Consejo. Professional wrestling career =Westside Mafia; faux retirement and CWS (2016‚Äì2017)= On January 14, 2017, Concepci√≥n and the Westside Mafia addressed the crowd in an event where he announced a premature retirement citing lingering injuries and in the process vacating the WWL World Heavyweight Championship. However, later that night he made an appearance in Championship Wrestling School (CWS), a developmental promotion that had recently received the support of a returning Negr√≠n, pursuing vengeance against BJ and attacking other heels. Prior to this, the promotion had already hinted his presence by publishing a darkened silhouette of him on January 13, 2017, promoting him as a surprise that would face Negr√≠n and his La Sociedad stable (of which BJ was a member). This appearance was followed by a hiatus. On March 18, 2017, Concepci√≥n reappeared in the CWS under a mask as part the Zona Urbana event, antagonizing Negr√≠n and La Sociedad. =Return to WWL and the \\"blessing of El Nazareno\\" (2017‚Äìpresent)= The blessing of El Nazareno consisted on randomly appearing to help his allies. Exemplified here by releasing Tab√∫ during a liberation match. The character of El Nazareno was born after fans used the term (literally meaning \\"the Nazarene\\") as a non-swearing insult in WWL's social media to criticize his jump to CWS, going viral and inspiring a number of memes superimposing his face in religious icons. Concepci√≥n adapted this nickname by adopting cross- themes gear and making use of angelic music while making promos and employing the catchphrase El Nazareno los bendice (lit. \\"El Nazareno blesses you\\"). In anticipation to his return, WWL began playing Ismael Rivera's eponymous religious salsa song in segments with the Westside Mafia, with some of its lyrics becoming additional catchphrases, in particular those making reference to \\"tak[ing] care of your friends\\" and \\"extend[ing] your hand to the fallen\\". On July 15, 2017, 450 defeated Joseph Cruz \\"J.C.\\" Navarro in a first contenders match, stole the WWL World Heavyweight Championship belt and rebranded himself the Mecha Wolf 450, also turning on the Westside Mafia. After Concepci√≥n relocated to Florida, he began making appearances in the independent circuit of the region. He also debuted a parallel character, Dark/Evil Nazareno (wearing the same uniform, but with a version of the mask that was completely black), which allowed him to perform as a heel under the same character. On January 10, 2018, this dark persona interfered on behalf of Angel Fashion in a Pro Wrestling 2.0 match against 450, leading to the creation of a stable known as The Holy Fashion along Carlos Cupeles. On February 9, 2018, Concepci√≥n made his debut for Cleveland Knights Championship Wrestling (CKCP), helping Fashion win the \\"Chase for the Case\\" six-man ladder match. At CKCW, the remaining two members of Tercera Generaci√≥n became part of The Holy Fashion. The group began a list of \\"Hall of #Blessed\\" wrestlers, which compiled those laid out by the group. \\"Sensacional\\" Roger D√≠az and Justin Dynamite (Jomar Merced) were the inaugural members. After weeks of stalking 450, Fashion faced him at Pro Wrestling 2.0 on February 13, 2018, where Nazareno and Cupeles joined the latter to make the former the \\"latest inductee\\" into the Hall of #Blessed by jumping him.

The 2017 - 2018 Commonwealth of Virginia Biennial Budget provided initial funding for the Virginia Cyber Range. Specifically, $4 million over two years was \\"designated to support a cyber range platform to be used for cyber security training by students in Virginia's public high schools, community colleges, and four-year institutions,\\" with Virginia Tech identified as the lead agency for the cyber range platform. The Virginia Cyber Range was initially funded on July 1st, 2016 with David Raymond selected as the Director, and in February 2017, named Amazon Web Services as a primary partner in the design of the Cyber Range. As of early 2019, the Cyber Range supports over 200 high schools, colleges, and universities in Virginia with infrastructure and courseware for cybersecurity classes and clubs. It also supports the annual Virginia CyberFusion Cyber Cup competition. The Virginia Cyber Range hosted the Inaugural Virginia Cybersecurity Education Conference at James Madison University in August 2018.

She was president of the National Lawyers Guild from 1988 until 1991.Debra Evenson papers, DePaul University Special Collections and Archives. Accessed June 2, 2017.  Education and early career  Evenson was born in New Jersey in 1942. She attended Barnard College, graduating with a B.A. in 1964. Then, Evenson received a Juris Doctor from Rutgers Law School in 1976. After working on Wall Street, for the firm Wilkie, Farr, and Gallagher, Evenson took a position as an associate professor of Law at DePaul University in 1980.  Career  Evenson first visited Cuba in 1982. She visited numerous times, conducting a study of the Cuban legal system since the revolution.Evenson, Debra. \\"Women's Equality in Cuba: What Difference Does a Revolution Make.\\" Law and Inequality: A Journal of Theory and Practice 4.2 (1986): 295-326. She left DePaul University in 1992, and joined the New York City law firm Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman. With the firm, Evenson represented the Cuban government, supporting Cuban sovereignty.Boghosian, Heidi. \\"NLG Mourns the Passing of Debra Evenson.\\" National Lawyers Guild Review 68.2 (2011): 126-127. She was also licensed to practice law in Cuba, where she worked with high government officials and civilians. In 1993, she was awarded a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation grant to research the role of lawyers in the changing Cuban society. Evenson wrote dozens of articles on Cuban laws and institutions, and she represented Cuba in numerous important court cases. She was a \\"critical supporter of the Cuban revolution,\\" and advocated for understanding Cuba as a complex system, successful in some areas and unsuccessful in others. Evenson arrived in Cuba as lawyers were necessary in society again, as the revolution gave way to institutions. Evenson was taken with the evolving legal landscape in Cuba and devoted her time and writing to it. Evenson was part of the cohort of lawyers and scholars that revived the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, from 1988 until 1991, Evenson served as president of the NLG. From 1996 until the early 2000s, Evenson was president of the Latin American Institute for Alternative Legal Services, a human rights legal group. In 2007, Evenson co-founded and served as executive director of the Center for Inter-American Legal Education, which supports education exchanges between lawyers and scholars in the United States and Latin America. She was a founding board member of the Sugar Law Center, which created an award in her honor following her death in 2011.

The drink has been developed and produced in Israel utilizing local herbs, fruits and spices. History and origin Tubi 60 was developed in 2012 by two brothers; Hilal and Yanai Tubi in Haifa, Israel. In 2013 the first distillery was opened in Haifa and obtained approvals, licenses and all the legal documents from the Israeli Health Ministry to produce Tubi 60. The liquor is also approved by the TTB. By mid 2014, the demand for Tubi rose across Israel and other nations. This led to the founding of a larger distillery in 2015 by the two brothers. In 2017, the Tubi company started exporting the liquor to the US, Hungary, Norway, Germany and other countries. Composition and taste Tubi 60 is made of lemon, enhanced with other local citrus fruits infused with herbs, spices, tree and flower extracts, including ginger, mint, anise, saffron, turmeric and cumin. Tubi 60 is most commonly served as a shot or a shooter, or mixed with tonic water or seltzer. Marketing Tubi 60 went viral in Israel mainly by word of mouth. Tubi 60‚Äôs reputation spread initially through sharing with friends of the founders and extended circles of friends and family. Later on the fans started to request it in bars and the bars contacted the owners directly with order requests. Uncommonly, Jerusalem was the first city that started to serve the drink in bars around the city and only in the middle of 2014 the drink made its way to the bar scene in Tel Aviv. After becoming popular in the city, the demand rose around the whole country. The makers of Tubi 60 claim the ingredients leave the consumer with a refreshing and uplifting feeling.

The first edition was held in 2010 in the Italian city of Bergamo, it is held annually in Italy, in summer. The game‚Äôs first and current champion is Jeffrey Wayne Gauvin from the United States of America. The game is a derivative of the Italian version of hide and seek, \\"nascondino\\" (hide-and-seek in Italian), and takes place on a playground in the open air, set up with artificial and natural hideouts.  History  The championship was first held in 2010 in Bergamo, Italy, as an initiative of CTRL Magazine, a local publication. The idea for an international tournament came about by accident at one of the founders' birthday parties, when he and his friends began a spontaneous game of hide and seek and wondered why there was no official world event. Though it started out as a joke, the event has grown year after year. The first 6 editions took place in Bergamo. The sixth edition took place in Consonno, an abandoned ghost town known as \\"Land of Toys\\" or \\"The Italian Las Vegas\\", located in the district of Lecco, Lombardy. The location was chosen as the perfect habitat for an hide-and-seek championship and to bring back to life an abandoned place through play. The seventh edition took place on September 3rd and 4th, 2016 in a 25,000-square-meter field, with 64 teams, including teams from Italy, France, Switzerland, Belgium and the United States, with 320 players taking part in total. After a qualification round and a final round a team from Marseille, France, won the competition. The eight edition took place on September 8th, 9th, 10th, 2017. The target of 80 teams was achieved, with teams from 5 continents and 11 countries: Italy, France, Portugal, Belgium, Switzerland, Hungary, Slovenia, Japan, Australia, United States, Africa (representing team with players from different African countries). The final round was deleted due to heavy rain. Despite the presence of more than 15 foreign teams, the first place was won by an Italian team.Nascondino World Championship 2016 Consonno, Italy  Format and rules  The rules of the game are a more codified version than the children's hideout. This is a team game, each consisting of 5 players. Players must be 18 years of age. Males and females play together. The playing field is an open air space with natural and artificial hiding. The championships are generally held in the summer. There are no qualifying tournaments. The organization manages the team registration process and sets the maximum limit for participating teams. The competition is carried out in rounds. Each round is played by one player per team. Players are given 1 minute to hide from the neutral seeker and 5 minutes to run to home base, a large soft mattress that you can launch yourself towards. The first to reach home base is awarded 20 points, the second is awarded 19 points and so forth. If a player is found by a seeker, the player will not receive any points. Players who do not reach home base before the time is up, and players who are found cheating will also not receive any points. The points obtained by the individual team members in each heat are added together to determine the top 20 teams that will advance to the finals. To ensure the game runs smoothly there will be referees positioned throughout the playing field. In the past editions, the team of neutral seekers was made up of Rugby and American football players, as they suited the role. The winning team is awarded \\"The Golden Fig Leaf\\", which is biblically the symbol of hiding, referring to the story of Adam and Eve.  Philosophy  Although it is a sporting competition, the organizers intends the hide-and- seek world championship as a moment of sociality and fun. That's why during the championships are organized music festivals, hidden concerts and other entertainment activities. The \\"Nascondino World Championship\\"'s philosophy invites people to come out and play hide-and-seek and also invites people to be themselves and stop hiding.  Variants  Yasuo Hazaki, a graduate of Nippon Sport Science University, and professor of media studies at Josai University in Sakado, Japan, had set up a campaign in 2013 to promote hide- and-seek for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The game Hazaki was promoting was a slightly different traditional Japanese game, more similar to a game of tag. Hazaki contacted \\"Nascondino World Championship\\" organizers and said that \\"Nascondino\\" rules were more appropriate to be a candidate to the Olympics.

Cast *David Birney as Aton *Sarah Douglas as Roa *Alexis Kanner as Sor *Andra Millian as Ana Production Nightfall was the short story which helped establish Isaac Asimov's reputation when it was published in 1941. Julie Corman became aware of it in 1979 when she read a review of an Asimov anthology in the New York Times. She was attracted by a story \\"about people who have recognizable moral dilemmas\\", and bought the screen rights.Counts p 60 Roger Corman announced in 1980 he would make the film with a reported $6 million budget, co-producing with a German company. When Asimov turned down the chance to adapt the story himself, Julie Corman approached Paul Mayersberg, then best known for writing The Man Who Fell to Earth. He passed so she tried a number of different writers.Counts p 60 \\"The problem was getting a script that had the essence of Nightfall and also had good, involving characters\\", says Corman. \\"Some of the scripts that we developed were excellent on the science-fiction elements, but they weren't very visual. In other versions, the characters were incredibly good but Asimov's philosophical war of words had been played down. Along the way. we encountered the usual money problems, so the project was put on the back burner.\\"Counts p 61 In July 1987 Corman eventually went back to Mayersberg after seeing his directorial debut, Captive (1986). Mayersberg agreed to write the script if he could direct. Corman agreed. Mayersberg wrote the script in five weeks in London and the film was shot over an eight-week period in October 1987.Counts p 62 Mayersberg said \\"I'm of the belief that, in general, film is not a very good medium for science fiction, it's visual, and therefore not very imaginative. Movies don't work well when it comes to picturing large landscapes, and so forth; film can only show you what exists, that which we can already see with our eyes, If you want to imagine a city in space, you have to build a model‚Äî and frankly, it looks like a model.\\"Counts p 61 The only characters retained from the story were Aton, astronomer, and leader of the city, and Sor, leader of the Believers (called the Cultists in the story). Mayersberg created the female character of Roa, who was once married to Aton but left him to become one of Sor's disciples. Maybersberg said the two men stood for \\"the relationship between science and religion as a means of explaining the world. As for the Day of Judgment, do you believe the religious view or do you subscribe to the scientific view that it's nothing more than an eclipse and is a part of the movement in the universe?\\"Counts p 62 The number of suns was reduced from six in the story to three. The film was shot in an organic architectural development in Arizona called Arcosanti. Scenes were also shot in Cosanti, just outside Scottsdale, and in the Tonto National Forest. Some Arcosanti residents appeared as extras.Counts p 62 Mayersberg said, \\"Instead of hardware and lasers, I used strings and elastic bands and crystal swords, whatever the people who lived on the planet could find that might exist or, in the case of something like a kite, could build. I wanted to omit the present totally, and work on merging the past and future.\\"Counts p 62 The film rained for three out of the five weeks of shooting. \\"Nightfall was, for me, about a slate of mind, not about a sequence of events\\", Mayersberg says. \\"I tried to present that in terms of the characters' lives and the way in which the film is constructed, which is not so much in dialogue as image. I intended the film to be about ways one can approach a life crisis. What do you do? Do you go mad, do you become rational, cowardly, throw reason to the winds? Do you try to figure it out, do you suddenly become religious? This is a story where there's a sort of nervous breakdown in the society where these people live, and how they cope with it.\\"Counts p 62 Reception The Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"With a low, low budget and high, high pretensions, Nightfall... dims and crashes down faster and harder than an Alaskan winter sunset. Genre fans and reluctant dates alike may find it as insufferable a sit-through as any science-fiction movie this decade.\\" Julie Corman later said it was one project of hers she wished she could remake with a bigger budget. \\"On a low budget, it was kind of hard to create that world\\", she said.

It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History The Manistee National Forest was created (as the Manistee Purchase unit) in 1933. In 1936, a fire control plan for the area was designed and implemented. Part of that plan was the construction of Udell Lookout Tower. Soon after a residence and garage were constructed near the tower; these buildings were moved about ten years later. Udell Tower remained a primary fire lookout tower until the 1960s, when aerial observation flights became more common. Many other lookout towers were abandoned at the same time, and were eventually destroyed or demolished. The Udell Lookout Tower is the last standing example of this type of tower in the Huron-Manistee National Forests. Description The Udell Lookout Tower is a 100 foot tall prefabricated steel frame tower, constructed from galvanized steel angles bolted together, located atop a hill.

In 2016 he won a minor race on his track debut but was then beaten in his next four races although he ran well in defeat to finish second in the Vintage Stakes and the Champagne Stakes and fourth in the Dewhurst Stakes. He produced his best performance of 2016 on his final start of the year when he was sent to France and recorded an emphatic victory in the Crit√©rium International. At the end of the year he was rated the best two-year-old trained in Britain. In early 2017 he was campaigned in Dubai and won the UAE 2000 Guineas and the UAE Derby before being shipped to the United States to contest the Kentucky Derby but effectively refused to race in the American contest. On his return to Europe he finished second in the Irish 2000 Guineas and third in the St James's Palace Stakes before winning the Prix Jean Prat. As a four-year-old he won the Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 2 before recording his biggest success in the Dubai World Cup. In the following year, he became the first horse to win the Dubai World Cup for a second time. Background Thunder Snow is a \\"tall, muscular, graceful\\" bay colt bred in Ireland by Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud and owned by the Sheikh's Godolphin Racing organisation. He is trained by Saeed bin Suroor who manages the preparation of the Godolphin horses in England during the summer and in Dubai in the winter months. The colt is the most successful of the first crop of foals sired by the Australian stallion Helmet, who won the Sires' Produce Stakes 1400m, Champagne Stakes 1600m (ATC) and Caulfield Guineas 1600m. Thunder Snow's dam Eastern Joy was beaten in her only race but as a broodmare she had produced three other winners namely Ihtimal (Sweet Solera Stakes, UAE 1000 Guineas, UAE Oaks), First Victory (Oh So Sharp Stakes) and Always Smile (Hambleton Stakes). Eastern Joy's dam Red Slippers also produced the Prix de Diane winner West Wind and was a half- sister to Balanchine. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Thunder Snow made his first racecourse appearance in a six-furlong maiden race at Leicester Racecourse on 31 May. Ridden by James Doyle he started at odds of 4/1 and won \\"readily\\" by one and a quarter lengths from Parys Mountain. Doyle was again in the saddle two weeks later when the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot and finished sixth of the eighteen runners behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Caravaggio. On 23 July at Goodwood Racecourse Thunder Snow started the 13/2 third choice in the betting for the Group 2 Vintage Stakes over seven furlongs. After tracking the leaders he went to the front in the last quarter mile but was overtaken by the O'Brien-trained War Decree 100 yards from the finish and beaten one and three quarter lengths into second place. On 10 September Thunder Snow started 2/1 second favourite behind Rivet for the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster. He took the lead two furlongs out but was soon joined by the favourite and was beaten a head into second place. The colt was then moved up to Group 1 class to contest Britain's most prestigious race for juveniles, the Dewhurst Stakes, at Newmarket on 8 October. Starting a 16/1 outsider he chased the leaders and stayed on in the closing stages without looking likely to win and came home fourth of the seven runners behind Churchill. Just over three weeks after his run at Newmarket the colt was sent to France for the Group 1 Crit√©rium International over 1400 metres on soft turf and was partnered for the first time by Christophe Soumillon. He was made the 3/1 third choice behind the Irish filly Promise To Be True (winner of the Silver Flash Stakes and runner up in the Prix Marcel Boussac) and his fellow British challenger South Seas (Solario Stakes) with the best-fancied of the French runners being Mate Story (Prix Thomas Bryon). After taking an early lead he settled in second behind the Godolphin pacemaker Bay of Poets before regaining the advantage entering the straight, at which point Soumillon tracked right to race up the stands- side. Thunder Snow went clear of his opponents entering the last 200 metres and won by five lengths despite being eased down by Soumillon in the final strides. After the race Soumillon commented \\"he was calm and super relaxed. I think he will be even better over a mile and further\\". In the official European Classification of two-year-olds for 2016 Thunder Snow was given a rating of 118, making him the best two-year-old trained in Britain and the third-best juvenile in Europe, four pounds behind Churchill and three behind the American filly Lady Aurelia. =2017: three-year-old season= Dubai In the winter of 2016/7 Thunder Snow was relocated to the United Arab Emirates where he was based at Godolphin's Al Quoz training facility. The colt began the season on the dirt track at Meydan Racecourse on 11 February when he started 6/4 favourite for the Group 3 UAE 2000 Guineas over 1600 metres (one mile), with the best of his rivals appearing to be Capezanno and Cosmo Charlie, both of whom had won on the track as well as the Autumn Stakes winner Best Solution. With Soumillon in the saddle again, Thunder Snow raced in second behind Capezanno before taking the lead at half way and drawing away to win \\"easily\\" by five and three quarter lengths from the outsider Bee Jersey. On 25 March the colt was stepped up in distance to face an international field in the UAE Derby over 1900 metres (nine and a half furlongs). He was made the 11/4 favourite ahead of the Japanese challenger Epicharis, Lancaster Bomber (runner up in the Dewhurst Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf) from Ireland and the Todd Pletcher-trained Master Plan from the United States. After tracking the leaders he steadily wore down the front-running Epicharis in the straight and won by a short head with Master Plan taking third ahead of Lancaster Bomber. Three days before his win in the UAE Derby Thunder Snow had been nominated for the American Triple Crown races and after his victory Godolphin's bloodstock advisor John Ferguson said \\"Sheikh Mohammed has told me that [an American campaign] is definitely an option. He was the leading horse in England last year and he won a Group 1 in France. He is very dear to our hearts. One has to be very happy with that\\". In April it was confirmed that the colt would indeed be aimed at the Kentucky Derby. Kentucky Derby Thunder Snow arrived in the United States on 30 April and spent two days in quarantine before being allowed to canter at Churchill Downs on 2 May. He appeared to cope well with his new surroundings with his regular work rider Daragh O'Donohoe reporting that \\"his behavior this morning was exceptional... He floated over the track, and I've no faults on him\\". Starting a 20/1 longshot in the Derby, on a wet, sloppy track with standing water, Thunder Snow broke awkwardly from stall two, and then began bucking and kicking as Soumillon struggled to control him. The colt refused to co-operate or join the race and was pulled up after less than a furlong, his behavior prompting a flurry of jokes on Twitter. The horse suffered no injury and his connections were unable to offer any explanation for his antics. Europe On his return to Europe the colt was matched against Churchill in the Irish 2000 Guineas on 25 May. Starting the 5/1 second favourite he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken by Churchill and beaten two and a half lengths into second place. At Royal Ascot he faced Churchill yet again in the St James's Palace Stakes. He finally finished in front of the Irish colt but was beaten into third by Barney Roy and Lancaster Bomber. For his next race, the colt was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix Jean Prat over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 9 July. With Soumillon in the saddle as usual he started second favourite behind the Prix Paul de Moussac winner Trais Fluors with the best fancied of the other three runners being the filly Gold Luck (Prix Vanteaux). Thunder Snow led from the start and was never seriously, challenged, accelerating away from his rivals in the straight and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Trais Fluors. On 13 August Thunder Snow was back in France and started favourite for the Group 1 Prix Jacques Le Marois over the straight 1600 metre course at Deauville Racecourse. He led until the final strides when he was overtaken and finished third, beaten a short head and a short neck by Al Wukair and Inns of Court. On his only subsequent start in 2017,Thunder Snow stated a 16/1 outsider for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot on 21 October. He was always towards the rear of the fifteen-runner field and finished tailed-off in last place. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Thunder Snow was given a rating of 118, making him rated the 90th best horse in the world. =2018: four-year-old season= Thunder Snow As in 2017, Thunder Snow spent the winter in Dubai and began his third campaign by contesting all three rounds of the Al Maktoum Challenge series at Meydan. In the first round over 1600 metres on 11 January he started favourite but came home second behind the eight-year-old gelding Heavy Metal. On 8 February Thunder Snow and Heavy Metal started joint-favourites for the second round over 1900 metres. Thunder Snow raced in mid-division before making a forward move in the straight, and overtook the front-running North America 100 metres from the finish to win by a neck with Heavy Metal four lengths back in third. The colt started odds-on favourite for the third round of the challenge over 2000 metres on 10 March, but was beaten into second by North America, who led from the start. On 31 March, Thunder Snow was one of ten horses to contest the 23rd running of the Dubai World Cup and started at odds of 8/1. The race featured a strong contingent from the United States comprising West Coast (the 5/4 favourite), Forever Unbridled, Gunnevera, Mubtaahij (Awesome Again Stakes) and Pavel (Smarty Jones Stakes). North America was again in opposition while the other runners included Talismanic and the Japanese entrant Awardee. Despite being drawn on the far outside, Thunder Snow went to the front soon after the start. He set a steady pace before accelerating on the final turn and drew away from his rivals in the straight to come home five and three quarter lengths clear of West Coast, with Mubtaahij a neck away in third place. Christophe Soumillon commented \\"I never thought I would be making the running, but no horses challenged early in the race. West Coast let me go. I was really cantering on the back straight and when I pushed him he kept finding\\". After a break of four and a half months, Thunder Snow returned to European turf for the International Stakes at York Racecourse on 22 August. Starting a 16/1 outsider he led the field into the straight but faded in the last quarter mile and came home last of the eight runners, more than 13 lengths behind the winner Roaring Lion. In September the horse was sent to the United States to contest the Jockey Club Gold Cup over ten furlongs on dirt at Belmont Park. After racing in third place behind Diversify and Mendelssohn he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten a neck by the 46/1 outsider Discreet Lover. On 3 November Thunder Snow was back in the United States for the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on 3 November and started at odds of 12/1 in a fourteen-runner field. After tracking the leaders he moved up on the inside to take second place in the straight and kept on under a hard ride from Christophe Soumillon to finish third behind Accelerate and Gunnevera, beaten less than two lengths by the winner. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Thunder Snow's rating of 122 made him the 20th best racehorse in world. =2019: five-year-old season= Thunder Snow began his 2019 campaign in the third round of the Al Maktoum Challenge at Meyda on 9 March. He started odds-on favourite but after settling in second place he was unable to mount a serious challenge to the front-running Capezzano and was beaten more than nine lengths by the winner. Three weeks later he started 4/1 third choice behind Capezzano and North America when he attempted to repeat his 2018 success in the Dubai World Cup. The other nine runners included Gronkowski, Yoshida (Woodward Stakes), Audible (Florida Derby), Gunnevera, Seeking the Soul and the South Korean champion Dolkong. North America set the pace from Gronkowski with Thunder Snow settled in third and few other horses ever looked likely to mount a serious challenge. Gronkowski got the better of the fading North America exiting the final turn but was soon joined by Thunder Snow on the outside. The pair raced side by side in the final stages with Thunder Snow securing a narrow lead 100 metres from the finish and winning by a nose from his rallying opponent. Commenting on the finish Christophe Soumillon said \\"I'd like to thank Sheikh Mohammed for putting the post right there... I knew no one was coming to catch us. I was very confident I'd catch Gronkowski, but I didn't want to hit the lead too soon. I wanted to get to the front late. Finally, when I hit it, I let him know he had to go a bit further. He just kept fighting. It was very hard. I was more looking like a Cheltenham jump jockey in the end than an American- style jockey, but you need to get him going and sometimes you need to do something different. Thanks to Thunder Snow, because without him I would not be able to do such things\\". In summer, Thunder Snow was sent to the United States again and made his next appearance in the Metropolitan Handicap over one mile at Belmont on 9 June. After struggling to obtain a clear run approaching the final turn he moved into second place behind Mitole in the straight but was unable to make any further progress and lost second spot to McKinzie in the final strides. Thunder Snow did not race again and it was announced in November that he had been retired from racing. Saeed Bin Suroor said \\"He was a class horse, who was very professional and easy to train. He was extremely tough and always tried his hardest in everything he did. He was one of the best horses to ever race for Godolphin and it was a privilege to train him.\\" In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Thunder Snow was given a rating of 121, making him the 29th best racehorse in the world.

It is located in the municipality of Palilula.  Location  The lake is located in the northern section of Krnjaƒça, north of downtown Belgrade. It is positioned at the tripoint of the neighborhoods of Borƒça, Ovƒça and Krnjaƒça. Geography Veliko Blato is situated in the southern part of the Panƒçevaƒçki Rit marshland. The lake is generally heart-shaped and covers an area of or with the adjoining fish ponds. It is the largest body of water in the Panƒçevaƒçki Rit, though it is shallow, as the maximum depth is only . The area of the entire protected zone which surrounds the lake, and includes four fish ponds to the north, is . The lake is embedded in the depression between the reed covered wet floodplains. The lake has no inflows or outflows, though the entire northern part is encircled by the Sebe≈° canal and another canal closely engulfs the entire lake. Water is replenished from the Danube and through the underground springs. The name of the lake means \\"great mudflat\\" in Serbian.  Wildlife  = Plants = Marsh helleborine In and around the lake there are 191 plant species, out of which 14 are protected. Since 1865, when Josif Panƒçiƒá found the first specimen, 30 species of orchids have been registered on the territory of the City of Belgrade. Two of them can be found only in Veliko Blato. One is marsh helleborine (Epipactis palustris (L.) Cr.), with some 200 individual plants. It grows only up to from the canal which encircles the lake. It was discovered near the lake in 2012. The other, with only some 50 specimens, is Orchis palustris Jacq. It grows between the turfs of grass where the water has dug minute canals. It was spotted for the first time in Belgrade in 1896 on the Great War Island, but was never seen again there. It has been re-discovered in the Maki≈° area in 1955, but by 2001 it disappeared, too. = Animals = One species of fish, European weatherfish, is protected. Other of the 15 species of fish include carp, northern pike, wels catfish, zander and silver carp, though they are introduced later. There are also 9 species of amphibians and 4 species of reptiles. The lake is suitable for newts, frogs, lizards, grass snakes and dice snakes. Veliko Blato is inhabited by 120 species of birds. There is a mixed colony of heron species which consists of little egrets, squacco herons, grey herons, night herons and purple herons. The colony was discovered only in June 2013 and is the only nesting heron colony on the urban territory of Belgrade, with several dozens of nesting couples. Other birds include Eurasian coot, great cormorant, pygmy cormorant, Caspian gull, black-headed gull, diving duck, common pochard, mallard, tufted duck. Largest European eagle, white-tailed eagle, nests in the other parts of Belgrade (Great War Island, Ada Huja), but feeds in the area. The lake is an internationally important area for the bird protection.  Human interaction  \\"Mika Alas\\", carp-breeding fish pond was established in 1961, when the lake was populated with many fish species. Veliko Blato is used as a feedlot for the larger fish. Four basins (including two fry ponds ), north of the lake, are built as a part of the fish pond. The lake is used for the sports fishing and all the fish that has been caught, must be released back into the lake. Every year, after the fishing season is over, the smaller basins are being emptied. In the early 2010s, an illegal dumping created a landfill south of the lake, which hastened the procedure of placing the lake under protection. Veliko Blato is not suitable for swimming and bathing due to the large quantities of mud in it.  Protection  Veliko Blato is a high valuable biotope, especially given its vicinity to the big city. It is part of an ecological area \\"Sava's mouth into the Danube\\" and due to its importance for the nesting, migration and wintering of the birds, it has been declared an Important Bird Area. It has been officially protected by the city government in May 2017, in the status of the \\"protected habitat\\".

Levin is a Professor Emeritus of the Jewish Theological Seminary, and since 1993 has served as the Artistic Director of the Milken Archive of Jewish Music. Levin has studied the music of Jewish experience from historical, musicological, ethnological, Judaic, and cross-cultural perspectives. His areas of focus embrace comparative considerations of eastern and western spheres of Ashkenazi Jewry in terms of their sacred, secular art, theatrical, and folk music; and the musical creativity and life of American Jewry.Kozinn, Allan (November 7, 2003). \\"Tradition, Tradition, Tradition? Not in American Jewish Music\\". New York Times. nytimes.com. Retrieved 2019-06-08. As a professor of Jewish music on the faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York since 1982, he teaches graduate courses on the history, development, and repertoire of synagogue music, cantorial art, Yiddish and Hebrew folksong, the music of modern Israel, and music of American Jewish experience. He is recognized as one of the leading authorities in the field of Jewish music in general, and he is in much demand as a lecturer and presenter at university seminars and academic conferences throughout the United States, Europe, and Israel. Biography Levin grew up in a musical family in the Chicago area, where his principal emphasis was on piano studies and performance. A pupil of the illustrious Swiss pianist Rudolph Ganz (1877‚Äì1972), he won local and national competitions in his teen years and, at the age of fourteen, played at the Ravinia Festival‚Äîthen the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He went to New York to study piano with Adele Marcus at The Juilliard School while pursuing a liberal arts degree at Columbia University. Influenced first by the cantor at his family‚Äôs congregation, and later by exposure to a number of great virtuoso cantors who were then still flourishing in New York synagogues, he developed a deep interest in cantorial art and history in the wider context of both synagogue and secular Jewish music studies. At Columbia, Levin studied with Howard Shanet, Jack Beeson, Mario Davidovsky, and Otto Luening‚Äîwho became his mentor. During that timeframe, he also began his exposure to traditional Yeshiva learning. After earning his B.A. degree, he spent a year in Israel, where he immersed himself in Hebrew language, Jewish studies, and Jewish musical investigations in preparation for his graduate academic work; and he also began to engage in field research and oral history collection‚Äîwhich he continued thereafter in the United States, Canada, and England. Returning to New York, he earned an M.A. degree at Columbia and, at the same time, studied both general Judaica and Jewish music at the Jewish Theological Seminary. It was there that he earned his doctorate in Jewish music and music history, with Hugo Weisgall (Chairman of the Faculty) playing a central role as his teacher, mentor, dissertation advisor, and‚Äîwhen Levin joined the Seminary‚Äôs faculty in 1982 after teaching for several years in the music department of Columbia‚Äîhis senior colleague. Levin was also profoundly influenced by private studies with two distinguished Jewish music historians and musicologists: Eric Werner and Albert Weisser. In addition to his academic work, Levin is also a highly regarded choral conductor. He studied choral conducting in Robert Page‚Äôs master classes and workshops at the Aspen Music School and Festival in the 1970s, and from 1973 to 1978 he directed the Chicago Zimriya Youth Chorus. He is the founder and director of two professional Jewish choruses: the mixed-voice Coro Hebraeica and the male- voice Schola Hebraeica, which has toured the United States and Canada numerous times, recorded extensively, and performed in England on several occasions. His London conducting debut was in 1988, and in 1990 he made his debut at the Royal Festival Hall in London, conducting the English Players and Schola Hebraeica in Voice of Jewish Russia‚Äîa production he devised. He is also the creator of Vanished Voices, a Holocaust commemoration incorporating his research into the music traditions of German-speaking Jewry, performed under his baton in 1996 at London‚Äôs Barbican Centre as well as in Los Angeles and New York. His Lincoln Center conducting debut was in 1997, and in 1999 he directed more than a dozen concerts (with Schola Hebraeica and other ensembles) at the biannual Sacred Voices Music Village international festival. From 1990 to 1998 Levin was the Editor of Musica Judaica, the academic Journal of the American Society for Jewish Music. He has published numerous articles on Jewish music, several archival-historical recordings (apart from the Milken Archive), and books. In 1982 the University of Vienna commissioned him to edit the complete works of Salomon Sulzer for the prestigious series, Denkm√§ler der Tonkunst in √ñsterreich (Monuments of Music). His historical study of music and cantorial education within the Conservative movement was published in 1997 in the book Tradition Renewed (edited by Jack Wertheimer). He has also contributed chapters to scholarly books on Jewish music, which are published in Germany. In addition, he has devised and directed five international academic conferences and conference-festivals on Jewish musical themes: Varied Voices (1987), co-sponsored by the Jewish Theological Seminary and the American Society for Jewish Music; A Voice for Our Time (1991), devoted to the music of Salomon Sulzer and other Austrian Jewish composers, and co-sponsored by the Seminary and Hebrew Union College; Counter-Harmonies (1989), a conference on the music of modern Israel, which was co-sponsored by the National Foundation for Jewish Culture, the 92nd Street Y, the Keshet Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts; Voice of Ashkenaz (1997), a deliberation on the musical legacy of German Jewry, co-sponsored by JTS and the Leo Baeck Institute; and Only in America (2003), which addressed the music of American Jewish experience and which was sponsored jointly by the Seminary and the Milken Archive. From February to May 2017, Levin served as YIVO‚Äôs first Anne E. Leibowitz Visiting Professor-in-Residence in Music. Awards In 2004, in recognition of his program notes about the Russian Jewish composer, Joseph Achron, in the accompanying booklet to the Milken Archive CD devoted to Achron‚Äôs music, Levin was presented with the coveted Deems Taylor Award‚Äîthe annual award given by the American Society of Composers and Publishers (A.S.C.A.P.) for the most original and informative liner notes to a commercially distributed recording.

Synopsis A nine- year-old boy is in desperate need to convince his grandfather, his only relative (a wayward character, who seems to be totally indifferent to the boy's fate), to take him back to his country home. Stealthily, he writes a letter to describe the unbearable life he leads in the house of the shoemaker Aliakhin, whom he serves as an apprentice for, suffering from hunger, abuse and humiliation. Finally, very pleased with his effort, he puts it into an envelope, inscribes the address: \\"The village, to my grandfather, Konstantin Makarych\\" and drops it into a post-box, well aware that it is upon this precious item that his whole life now totally depends.

His sculptures can mostly be seen in Genoa in the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno. Biography Born in Genoa, he attended the Ligustica Academy of Fine Arts in Genoa, where he was a pupil of Scanzi (he worked at the Carpaneto tomb), and later became a professor (in 1894 he was appointed academic of merit for the sculpture class and present until 1938 year of his death).

Jennifer Senior, writing for The New York Times, said that while the book's intended audience is initially presumed to be a wide range of women, class bias emerges later in the book.

The label of origin \\"W√©pion strawberry\\" is not geographically protected. thumb  History  The Auction of W√©pion (): the market place Between the two World Wars, the paid leave entitlement and the emergence of popular tourism in the production area contributed to the reputation of this strawberry. Many families from the villages of Bois-de-Villers, Dave, Maillen, Malonne and W√©pion and the surroundings have for decades cultivated small areas (a few ares), selling the produce on the public squares of different villages. The trade expansion happened in the 1960s with the consolidation of the different local marketplaces in a cooperative that was located at the border between Bois-de-Villers and W√©pion. The building very quickly came to be called \\"Auction of W√©pion\\" (\\"Cri√©e de W√©pion\\" in French) and then included several hundreds of strawbery producers. The urbanization of the villages and the increase of legal restrictions in the 1970s prompted a drastic and important reduction of the number of producers, only about ten of whom remained in the early 1980s. Their production and marketing methods became more professional and the production area spread over twenty kilometres around the \\"Cri√©e de W√©pion\\". The professional strawberry producers were born. In the early 2000s, the cooperative became a real producers organization (EEC Regulation 2200/96), opened for all the producers who feel concerned with the spread of strawberry production.  General points  The W√©pion strawberry is grown according to very strict specifications and producers are helped by some agronomic technicians who are members of an independent structure, \\"the Walloon Strawberry Producers Organization\\" (\\"le Groupement des Fraisi√©ristes Wallons\\" in French). The first strawberries of May are harvested thanks to greenhouses or plastic tunnels which can be heated or not. June is meant for unforced and field production. From July to October, harvests from the seedlings bedded out from April to July extend the growing season. The care that strawberry plants need is registered so that the strawberry producer can ensure the traceability of the marketed strawberry at any time. Checks are carried out every day in order to assure the required quality and to prevent any problems. Strawberries arranged in cardboard punnets Strawberries are harvested fully ripe in the morning before the intense heat of the afternoon and they are then carefully arranged in punnets or in cartons. Besides their fully ripe crop, the particularity of the \\"Cri√©e de W√©pion\\"'s strawberries is the fact that they are presented by being arranged in the same vein on the top of the punnet. By evening of their crop day, the strawberries are sold through the auction to both the wholesalers or retail outlets and supermarkets, that can then offer them to sell from the following day. \\"La Cri√©e de W√©pion\\" is an approved cooperative and it collaborates with \\"the Strawberry Producers Organization\\" (\\"le Groupement des Fraisi√©ristes\\" in French) -GFW- which is the pilot centre of the strawberry sector in Wallonia.  Auction  Every evening at 7.30 during the harvest season, the strawberry growers offer their produce at an auction which is open to the merchants and traders. Clock for the auction sale The buyers, gathered in one place, bid Dutch auction style on a price which is given on a dial (\\"the clock\\"), the hours of which are replaced with a price and the hand of which can be stopped by the buyers present.

Both sexes had horns, which were subtriangular at base and ranged from 6cm to 9cm in length. Behaviour and habitat Duboisia santeng was a forest-dwelling animal that preferred forest with a close canopy. Examination of this species tooth has shown that it was a browser, primarily feeding on leaves and occasionally on harder vegetation. The habitat ranged from moderately to very humid forests.

Character  Rabbi Harvey is a Jewish rabbi who also functions as an Old West sheriff in the fictional Rocky Mountain frontier town of Elk Spring, Colorado. Harvey solves disputes with rabbinical wit and wisdom rather than a gun. In The Adventures of Rabbi Harvey and Rabbi Harvey Rides Again, which were published first, each chapter is a separate story, whereas in the third book, Rabbi Harvey vs. the Wisdom Kid, each chapter is part of a larger story arc. Each story takes inspiration from one or more Jewish folktales and puts a Western spin on it. This eclectic mixing of genres sprang from Sheinkin's childhood as a Jewish-American boy who read both Jewish legends and American Westerns. Rabbi Harvey not only contains elements of a wise mythical rabbi and a heroic lawman but also reflects the author's father, David Sheinkin. = Appearance = Sheinkin, who illustrates as well as writes the Harvey books, always portrays Harvey with a full beard and thick unibrow. According to the chapter \\"You're a Brave Man, Harvey\\" in The Adventures of Rabbi Harvey, \\"Harvey grew up in the Adirondack Mountains of northern New York.\\" He had a sister and constantly daydreamed of being a character in Bible stories. How Harvey came out West is not entirely clear. In the chapter \\"There's a New Rabbi in Town\\" in The Adventures of Rabbi Harvey, it is indicated that Harvey had never been out West when he came to Elk Spring looking for a rabbi job after graduating in New York City while working at a pickle factory. However, in the chapter \\"Deputy Harvey, San Francisco\\" in Rabbi Harvey Rides Again, Harvey appears to have been a much younger, beardless man when he sails from New York to San Francisco \\"with nothing but ten dollars and a change of clothes.\\" There he works selling bread and as a sheriff's deputy.  Other characters  One recurring character is Milton \\"Big Milt\\" Wasserman, an outlaw who appears with his two-man \\"gang\\" as reigning with terror over Elk Spring before Harvey's arrival. Big Milt appears again in Rabbi Harvey Rides Again with his incompetent son Wolfie,both of whom appear throughout Rabbi Harvey vs. the Wisdom Kid, in which Wolfie is elected sheriff by the town council of Helms Falls. Another major villain is ‚ÄúBad Bubbe‚Äù Bloom, a conniving grandmother who appears in The Adventures of Rabbi Harvey as the proprietor of Bubbe's Inn, running a bakery booth in Rabbi Harvey Rides Again, and again in Rabbi Harvey vs. the Wisdom Kid, along with sons Solomon Bloom III, a banker, and Rabbi Ruben ‚ÄúThe Wisdom Kid‚Äù Bloom. A final recurring character is Harvey's love interest, Abigail, who first appears in Rabbi Harvey Rides Again as a down-on-her-luck gold miner who travels to Elk Spring and becomes the town's schoolteacher; she reappears in Rabbi Harvey vs. the Wisdom Kid.

He was first introduced in the Naruto spin-off manga Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring (2015), being portrayed as a transfer student attending classes in Konohagakure to become a ninja. By the events of the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015), Mitsuki has become a ninja on a team with protagonist Boruto Uzumaki and Sarada Uchiha, taking a lead role in Uky≈ç Kodachi and Mikio Ikemoto's manga sequel to Naruto, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016), and its anime prequel, which shows how he became friends with Boruto while facing different enemies. A one-shot by Kishimoto reveals that Mitsuki is an experiment created by the Legendary Sannin and former enemy of Naruto, Orochimaru, who allowed him to take his own path in life. In the making of the film Boruto and the anime series, Hiroyuki Yamashita was in charge of developing the character despite his small role in the film. Critical reception to Mitsuki has been mixed. While his role in the Boruto film was criticized for its lack of development, both his backstory portrayed in the one-shot and his role in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations were praised for adding depth to his character, even though he remained a mysterious child. Creation and conception Masashi Kishimoto designed Mitsuki to provide hints to his lineage through his snake-themed features such as his eyes. He originally had a shoulder length bob, but the author decided to change his hair to make him look more appealing, giving him a short white hairstyle instead. Mitsuki was given a kimono with long sleeves. Rather than making the outfit casual, Kishimoto made it suitable for war by hiding Mitsuki's hands in the design, making it difficult for people to know his intentions. He was also equipped with a ninja tool pouch, which is longer than regular pouches, on the fastener of his sash. Boruto anime director Hiroyuki Yamashita commented on Mitsuki's part in the film, saying that he was much more of a gentle character. After reading the character's own story, Yamashita felt that Mitsuki's image was solidified. After the first screening, there was a scene that showed Mitsuki‚Äôs true form, and the director recalled that everyone was stirred up by it. That was the first time he thought, \\"it seems that (Mitsuki) might be intriguing\\". Afterward, he remembered being praised by Kishimoto, but Yamashita pointed out that he had not felt any satisfaction. In the making of the Boruto film, the character guidebook described Mitsuki as \\"An enigma shrouded in many mysteries. A boy with a composed expression... His slightly- long white hair has a waviness to it.\\" Once the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime started, the director said that, while in the beginning Mitsuki and Sarada Uchiha were only classmates, the two would have \\"a more developed relationship from now on\\". Mitsuki's Japanese voice actor, Ry≈´ichi Kijima, stated that he had been asked by the staff to sound emotionless. However, Kijima gave him a more notable characterization, citing his dynamic with Boruto since Mitsuki tends to help him. In the English dub, Mitsuki is voiced by Robbie Daymond, who said he is very honored to voice the character. Daymond and the other Boruto English voice actors were grateful to play the characters given how large the franchise is. Appearances Mitsuki makes his first appearance in the Naruto spin-off manga Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring (2015) as a young child training to become a ninja. By the events of the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015), Mitsuki has become a low- ranking ninja, Genin, teaming up with Boruto Uzumaki and Sarada Uchiha, and led by Konohamaru Sarutobi. In the film, the team takes part in the examination test, the Chunin Exams, to improve their ranking. After the post- credits scene, Mitsuki confesses to Boruto and Sarada that he is the son of the criminal Orochimaru, shocking Sarada. Mitsuki's backstory is explored in Naruto Gaiden: The Road Illuminated by the Full Moon (2016), where it is revealed that Mitsuki is an artificial human created by Orochimaru for his use. Despite this, Mitsuki decides to abandon his master and sets out toward Konohagakure to find Boruto, whom he regards as his \\"sun\\". Mitsuki can extend his limbs by using chakra to dislocate his joints. The manga series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016) by Uky≈ç Kodachi and Mikio Ikemoto begins by retelling the events from the film, but afterward both Mitsuki and Sarada reject a ninja mission in order to save Boruto from an assassin. Their team captain disappears while on an undercover mission, and Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki are sent to find him by their superiors. The anime series of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2017) shows how Mitsuki enters the ninja academy and befriends Boruto as well as other children training to become ninjas. During the series, Mitsuki helps Boruto find the criminal behind the attacks meant to contaminate people's chakras. In a following arc, Mitsuki goes on a trip to Kirigakure where he joins the Mist ninjas and his allies in trying to stop a rebellion led by seven swordsmen. Following this arc, Mitsuki declares he will become a ninja to keep track of Boruto, feeling his encounter with him has changed his way of seeing life. After this arc, Mitsuki and his friends become ninjas after passing a test, and he, Boruto, and Sarada form the new \\"Team 7\\" under the leadership of Konohamaru. In the anime, Mitsuki disappears to from the Leaf Village and his friends go on a mission to prove his innocence over their superiors. They learn that Mitsuki is catching up with ninjas from the Stone Village who confront Mitsuki's teammembers. Mitsuki interrupts the battle and takes down Boruto. Mitsuki allies with a group of artificial humans known as a Fabrications to perform a coup on the Stone although Mitsuki is later revealed to be an agent. He once again joins his team when defeating their leader, Ku. Apart from the manga and anime, Mitsuki appears in the Boruto light novels. He is also a playable character in the fighting game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (2016). He also appears in an original video animation where Team Konohamaru is sent to stop an apparent thief. He is also playable in the video game Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker (2018). Reception Critical reception to Mitsuki's character has been mixed based on his limited appearances in the film's story as well as his role in the printed and animated series. Thais Valdivia of Hobby Consolas stated that while Mitsuki's characterization was not properly executed in the film due to his limited appearances, his post-credit scenes would surprise the audience because of the revelation behind his heritage. The Fandom Post writer Chris Homer expressed a similar belief regarding the limited exploration of Mitsuki's character until the film's ending. Toon Zone felt that Mitsuki and Sarada provided good contrasts to Boruto in the film and also praised Robbie Daymond for his work as Mitsuki's English voice actor. Similarly, Amy McNulty of Anime News Network praised Daymond's performance, saying that while being \\"calm, collected, and oftentimes emotionless, the voice helps lend the character much of his mystery\\". Sarah Nelkin of Anime Now felt Mitsuki had no development in the film despite being a recurring fighter supporting the lead character. Once Mitsuki's past was explored in Masashi Kishimoto's one-shot manga, McNulty felt his origins were engaging, but at the same time not completely explained, and believed this was due to the ambiguous nature of the one-shot. Similarly, Melina Dargis, another The Fandom Post writer, considered Mitsuki's chapter the best in the first volume of the Boruto manga due to his connections with Orochimaru, and she felt it could have been used in the film. Nik Freeman of Anime News Network found Mitsuki's backstory one of the best in the franchise's history because it was not a rehash of prior story arcs. Rebecca Silverman of the same site wondered how Mitsuki's origins might clash with Boruto's as the series' main theme due to the issues they both face: the relationship between children and their parents. After Mitsuki had debuted in the Boruto anime television series, McNulty wrote that while his introduction was overshadowed by the episode's focus on his ninja academy teacher Shino Aburame, his role fitted into the story and she still found him mysterious. She also praised his actions in the episode as well as his interactions with Boruto. Sam Stewart of IGN had similar thoughts, saying that, like Sarada, Mitsuki was not properly introduced in his debut because the plot focused on Shino. In a later review, McNulty considered Mitsuki and Boruto's fight against the Ghost culprit, Sumire Kakehi, one of the best in the Boruto anime. Stewart agreed, saying that the fight was well-animated despite there being minor issues with the animation in other parts from the sequence. Nelkin felt the series succeeded in exploring more of Mitsuki, which was needed considering his minor role in the film. The writer additionally compared him with Naruto character Sai since both rarely express their emotions during their introductions into the series. Nelkin also described Mitsuki as a \\"character that is growing as a person as he spends time with his comrades\\", the teenagers attending the ninja academy.

It remained active for 2 years.  History  Telstar 2, primarily a communications satellite, carried an experiment designed to measure the energetic proton and electron distribution in the Van Allen belts. The spacecraft spin axis shortly after launch was about 80 deg to the ecliptic plane. The initial spin rate was 180 rpm, and it varied slowly over the life of the spacecraft. Telstar 2 was essentially identical to the Telstar 1 satellite. It employed two transmitters, and data were telemetered via a PCM/FM/AM encoder. The telemetry sequence required about 1 min. Telstar 2 differed from Telstar 1 by employing provisions for scientific information to be transmitted in real time via the microwave telemetry system so that telemetry could be obtained after the 2 years timer had turned off the VHF beacon. On May 16, 1965, at 1403 UT, during the satellite's 4736 orbit, the VHF transmitter was turned off. All systems operated normally until that time. The satellite was launched into space on May 7, 1963, on a Delta-B rocket from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, United States. The European receiving station for Telstar 2 was built in Brittany, France, near the village of Pleumeur-Bodou, at which the 340-ton pivotally mounted antenna sits under a 50-meter diameter radar dome. These buildings still exist as part of a communications museum.

Heidik is an American actor best known for winning the reality TV competition show Survivor: Thailand.  Personal life and career Heidik was born to a Finnish mother and a German father. He attended Paint Branch High School in Burtonsville, and played quarterback on the high school football team. He later enrolled at North Carolina State University. He was once married to Charmaine \\"C.C.\\" Costigan from 2000‚Äì06; between them, they have one son, Logan. He has been married to his second wife Courtney since 2006; with her, they have three children of their own. Heidik once lived in New York City while working as an actor. He has guest starred on such television shows as Doogie Howser, M.D., Baywatch Nights, and Days of Our Lives, as well as Melrose Place.  Survivor  In 2002, Heidik competed on the fifth season of the American version of Survivor, entitled Survivor: Thailand. As part of the Chuay Gahn tribe, Heidik was not immediately targeted due to his physical strength and his ability to provide food for the tribe. Early on in the game, he was considered a trustworthy individual, despite being reputed by all as a used car salesman. However, his status as trustworthy would soon change dramatically. When Heidik's tribe lost the first and second immunity challenges, he joined the majority to vote out John Raymond and Tanya Vance. After the \\"Grindgate\\" incident between Ted Rogers, Jr., and Ghandia Johnson, Heidik was worried that the rift between the two would divide the tribe. So he enlisted the help of Helen Glover to side with himself, Rogers and Clay Jordan to vote out Johnson, which they did successfully in Episode Four. By doing so, he created a Final Two alliance with Glover, despite already having one with Rogers. Chuay Gahn then enjoyed two immunity wins. When there were only ten castaways left in the game, the two tribes began living on the same beach, believing they had merged into one tribe. However, Jeff Probst soon informed them that this was not the case. Chuay Gahn continued their winning streak for two more episodes, dwindling the former Sook Jai members to only three. When the tribes finally merged at eight members, Heidik was a strong force in keeping the Chuay Gahn alliance strong and ousting the remaining former Sook Jai members at back-to-back Tribal Councils. They were very successful, voting out Ken Stafford, Penny Ramsey and Jake Billingsley. At this point Heidik had three Final Two alliances, each with Glover, Rogers and Jordan. At the Final Five, the remaining castaways (all members of Chuay Gahn) were forced to turn on each other. Glover and Rogers had a plan to align with Jan Gentry and vote out Jordan, whom they believed did not deserve a spot in the Final Two. When Heidik heard the two had been talking, he wrongly believed this was against himself, with neither Glover nor Rogers having this idea in mind. After winning individual immunity, Heidik, together with Gentry, Glover, and Jordan, voted out Rogers despite their Final Two alliance. At the Final Four, Heidik enjoyed another immunity win and informed Glover that Gentry would be voted out. However, he used Gentry to vote out Glover, believing that she was unbeatable in the Final Two and had conspired against him. At the Final Three, Heidik felt comfortable with his game and immunity wins, despite backstabbing two of his former tribemates. He managed to win the final immunity, and chose to vote out Gentry, taking Jordan into the Final Two. Gentry was the only former Chuay Gahn Final Five member with whom Heidik did not have a Final Two alliance. Believing Jordan was more hated, Heidik thought he had made the right decision. However, Heidik faced a tough Jury and in particular a very angry Glover. In the end, Heidik beat out Jordan in a 4‚Äì3 vote to become the Sole Survivor. He managed to gain the votes of Billingsley, Rogers, Glover, and Gentry. Heidik was benefited by a usual occurrence on Survivor when two of his votes came from a vote against Jordan, particularly Glover and Rogers, whom Heidik himself betrayed in the game, but still voted for him over Jordan. Rogers mentioned that he was voting for Heidik, because he was \\"the lesser of two evils\\". Heidik officially received his million dollar check on December 20, 2002. =Reception= Heidik has generally been regarded as one of the least likable Survivor winners ever, according to Dr. Brad Wolgast, Ph.D., and Survivor expert Mario Lanza. In 2007, Wolgast and Lanza, in a book about Survivor, called Heidik \\"the most cold-hearted player of them all,\\" and they went on to compare him to a \\"detached gunslinger,\\" an \\"emotionless, unempathetic cyborg,\\" and a \\"sociopath.\\" In the years following Survivor: Thailand, Heidik was never even talked about in a nice way by any of his fellow castaways. According to Wolgast and Lanza, no one who had ever been on Survivor had even bothered to mention Heidik in interviews or chats. Controversies While taping Survivor in 2002, Heidik claimed that he was a used car salesman. But it was later revealed that he had also worked as a soft-core porn actor alongside his then-wife C.C. As an adult film star, he went under the name \\"Dave Roth.\\" After Survivor: Thailand finished taping, Heidik got a restraining order against C.C. over an assault which he claimed she perpetrated against him in November 2002. But a few weeks later, on December 16, his wife's scheduled court date, he did not show up for the hearing. Prior to the court date, the restraining order had been lifted. He divorced C.C. four years later and quickly remarried. On July 5, 2006, Heidik was arrested in Douglas County, Georgia, on charges of shooting a puppy dog with an arrow. When police came to his house, he tried to flee in his car, but was quickly apprehended. On June 19th, 2019, Heidik did an interview with Jonny Fairplay and Matt Bischoff on their podcast SurvivorNSFW about the incident and what he's been up to lately.

Fairly serious in content with a focus on radical organizing issues, it was loosely aligned with the SDS movement. The first issue was dated March, 1969, with two editorial offices in New York, where Carol Brightman, Beverly Leman, and Kathy McAfee were listed on the first masthead, later to be joined by a number of others including Marge Piercy and Sol Yurick; and San Francisco, where the collective included Peter Booth Wiley, Carole Deutch, Danny Beagle, Matthew Steen, Bob Gavriner, Al Haber, Bruce Nelson, Todd Gitlin and David Wellman. Part of the inspiration for the paper was a desire to fill the gap created by the demise of the influential New Left organ Studies on the Left, and the core group included people from the antiwar newsletter Viet Report.Wiley, Peter Booth. \\"Where Did All The Flowers Go?\\", in Ten Years That Shook the City: San Francisco 1968-1978 (San Francisco: City Lights Books, 2011), p. 97-102. Responsibility for producing successive issues alternated between the San Francisco and New York offices. Initially planned to appear on a regular monthly schedule, by the end of the first year the publication schedule had cut back to 9 issues a year, appearing at roughly 6 week intervals. In San Francisco the paper occupied space at 330 Grove Street that it rented for $25 a month, in a building which also housed underground comics publisher Don Donahue, a group that produced rock concert light shows, the Black Writers Workshop, underground newspapers Dock of the Bay and The Movement, the San Francisco office of Liberation News Service, and other tenants; it later relocated into a new space at 968 Valencia Street. Due in part to factional stresses in the post-SDS Weatherman Underground era, the paper folded in late 1970 after a run of 13 issues, with its last issue dated vol. 2, no. 4, Fall 1970. Notable articles that appeared in the paper during its run included Marge Piercy's \\"The Grand Coolie Damn\\", \\"You Do Need a Weatherman\\" by Shin'ya Ono, and an interview with Carlos Marighella shortly before his death.

Nevertheless, during the first months of 1807, power was still vacant in the South since the partition of the country in December 1806. Political responsibility Bruno Blanchet took part in the Constituent Assembly on 18 December 1806. He presented to the National Assembly on 27 December 1806, the report of the commission with a view to getting the new Constitution adopted before the parliamentarians.Text of the Constitution of 1806 Haiti is declared a republic with a president and a senate, and a rigid separation of powers between the two. Christophe will not accept the terms of this new Constitution and will try to take Port-au- Prince (early January 1807). He will be repulsed by the defenders of Alexander P√©tion and will retire to the North of Haiti. Secretary of State Bruno Blanchet provisionally becomes Acting President of the Republic of Haiti from 19 January 1807 to 10 March 1807. On 10 March 1807, Alexander Petion officially became President of the Republic and appointed Bruno Blanchet Secretary General of the Government.De Saint-Domingue √† Ha√Øti, 1791-1870 Par Leslie Jean-Robert P√©an  References Category:Presidents of Haiti Category:Finance ministers of Haiti Category:Haitian people of Mulatto descent Category:People from Sud (department) Category:Members of the Senate (Haiti) Category:19th-century Haitian people Category:19th-century heads of government Category:Haitian people of Grenadian descent Category:Haitian rebel slaves Category:Haitian Roman Catholics Category:Haitian slaves Category:Suicides by firearm in Haiti Category:Haitian politicians who committed suicide Category:People of the Latin American wars of independence Category:People of Saint-Domingue Category:1800s in Haiti Category:1810s in Haiti Category:1820s in Haiti Category:19th-century monarchs in North America Category:1760 births Category:1822 deaths ","title":"Bruno Blanchet"},{"id":"53952713","text":"The Universidad de Medell√≠n was founded on February 1, 1950.

He is best known for his work in contemporary music, free improvisation, and electro-acoustic music.  Biography  Alder grew up in Westland, a suburb of Detroit, and performed with the Michigan Youth Band at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor while in high school. He holds a degree in music from Michigan State University, where he studied clarinet with Frank Ell. In 2006 he moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, to study bass clarinet at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam with Erik van Deuren, where he obtained a second degree. He received an MMus from the Artez Conservatorium in Arnhem, Netherlands, studying free improvisation in the New Dutch Swing program with saxophonist and bass clarinetist Frank Gratkowski and double bassist Wilbert de Joode. In 2017 he began a PhD program at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, UK researching the contrabass clarinet. His other teachers have included Richard Hawkins, Kimberly Cole, Yaniv Nachum, Michael Lowenstern, David Krakauer, Ernesto Molinari, and Claudio Puntin. Alder specializes in contemporary classical music and working with electronics. In 2010 he created a Max/MSP patch to perform Karlheinz Stockhausen's \\"Solo f√ºr melodieinstrument und R√ºckkopplung\\" using only a computer in place of the 6 reel-to-reel tape machines and 4 assistants originally required to perform the piece. Alder has also worked with composers to develop electronics for their compositions. In 2013 he collaborated with Robert Ratcliffe on his piece \\"Wake up Call\\", originally for bass clarinet and fixed-medium electronic accompaniment. Alder created a Max/MSP patch which allowed for adding effects to the bass clarinet, as well as rearranging the sections of the piece, as is specified by Ratcliffe in the score. He has worked with and/or premiered pieces from a number of composers, including Christian Wolff, Stefan Prins, Gabriel Prokofiev, Andr√© Douw, Francisco Castillo Trigueros, Andys Skordis, Thanos Chrysakis, Rodrigo Tasc√≥n, Yu Oda, and Thanasis Deligiannis. He also performs with flutist Katalin Szanyi in the Shadanga Duo, which worked with composer Louis Aguirre and other members of the Danish composers group Snow Mask to commission and premiere new works. In 2018, he became the first person to play the contrabass clarinet in Cuba with a solo performance at the Havana Festival of Contemporary Music. In addition to composed music, Alder is an improviser and has performed solo, in Sonido 13- an electroacoustic duo with saxophonist Harry Cherrin, and with other improvisers such as Tom Jackson and Alex Ward. In duo with Austrian vocalist Magdalena Hahnkamper as megalodon/na, he won the Lyrik Live prize from the Austrian radio station √ñ1 for a free improvisation theater/performance art/video piece. Alder also performs in jazz and world music bands such as the klezmer-jazz band Payazen!, gypsy punk band Victor Menace, afrobeat bands JORO and Matuki, with Bangladeshi/British singer Shapla Salique, and with the Balkan-jazz band Mimika. He has also studied karnatic music. In 2014 Alder toured with Idina Menzel and Rob Mounsey, and has played in other pop and rock bands such as The Lazlo Device, The Palumbo Phunk, Novack, Canvas Blanco, and RaskalBOMFukkerz. He played bass guitar in the bands Spinfist and June Ruin. Alder has performed at festivals around the world, such as ClarinetFest, European Clarinet Festival, Istanbul Woodwind Festival, American Single Reed Summit, Gaudeamus Contemporary Music Festival, Ultima Oslo Contemporary Music Festival, Havana Festival of Contemporary Music, International Festival for Artistic Innovation, and the Ferrara Buskers Festival.

The model is used to generate predictions of sensory input that are compared to actual sensory input. This comparison results in prediction errors that are then used to update and revise the mental model. Origins Theoretical ancestors to predictive coding date back as early as 1860 with Helmholtz's concept of unconscious inference. Unconscious inference refers to the idea that the human brain fills in visual information to make sense of a scene. For example, if something is relatively smaller than another object in the visual field, the brain uses that information as a likely cue of depth, such that the perceiver ultimately (and involuntarily) experiences depth. The understanding of perception as the interaction between sensory stimuli (bottom-up) and conceptual knowledge (top-down) continued to be established by Jerome Bruner who, starting in the 1940s, studied the ways in which needs, motivations and expectations influence perception, research that came to be known as 'New Look' psychology. In 1981, McClelland and Rumelhart in their seminal paper examined the interaction between processing features (lines and contours) which form letters, which in turn form words. While the features suggest the presence of a word, they found that when letters were situated in the context of a word, people were able to identify them faster than when they were situated in a non-word without semantic context. McClelland and Rumelhart's parallel processing model describes perception as the meeting of top-down (conceptual) and bottom-up (sensory) elements. In the late 1990s, the idea of top-down and bottom-up processing was translated into a computational model of vision by Rao and Ballard.Rajesh P. N. Rao & Dana H. Ballard. (1999). Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects. Nature Neuroscience 2, 79 - 87. Their paper demonstrated that there could be a generative model of a scene (top-down processing), which would receive feedback via error signals (how much the visual input varied from the prediction), which would subsequently lead to updating the prediction. The computational model was able to replicate well-established receptive field effects, as well as less understood extra-classical receptive field effects such as end-stopping. Today, the fields of computer science and cognitive science incorporate these same concepts to create the multilayer generative models that underlie machine learning and neural nets.Hinton, G. E. (2007). Learning multiple layers of representation. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 11(10), 428‚Äì434.  General framework  Most of the research literature in the field has been about sensory perception, particularly vision, which is more easily conceptualized. However, the predictive coding framework could also be applied to different neural systems. Taking the sensory system as an example, the brain solves the seemingly intractable problem of modelling distal causes of sensory input through a version of Bayesian inference. It does this by modelling predictions of lower-level sensory inputs via backward connections from relatively higher levels in a cortical hierarchy.Clark, A. (2013). Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 36(03), 181‚Äì204. Constrained by the statistical regularities of the outside world (and certain evolutionarily prepared predictions), the brain encodes top-down generative models at various temporal and spatial scales in order to predict and effectively suppress sensory inputs rising up from lower levels. A comparison between predictions (priors) and sensory input (likelihood) yields a difference measure (e.g. prediction error, free energy, or surprise) which, if it is sufficiently large beyond the levels of expected statistical noise, will cause the generative model to update so that it better predicts sensory input in the future. If, instead, the model accurately predicts driving sensory signals, activity at higher levels cancels out activity at lower levels, and the posterior probability of the model is increased. Thus, predictive coding inverts the conventional view of perception as a mostly bottom-up process, suggesting that it is largely constrained by prior predictions, where signals from the external world only shape perception to the extent that they are propagated up the cortical hierarchy in the form of prediction error. =Precision weighting= Expectations about the precision (or inverse variance) of incoming sensory input are crucial for effectively minimizing prediction error in that the expected precision of a given prediction error can inform confidence in that error, which influences the extent to which the error is weighted in updating predictions.Feldman, H., & Friston, K. (2010). Attention, uncertainty, and free-energy. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 4, 215. Given that the world we live in is loaded with statistical noise, precision expectations must be represented as part of the brain's generative models, and they should be able to flexibly adapt to changing contexts. For instance, the expected precision of visual prediction errors likely varies between dawn and dusk, such that greater conditional confidence is assigned to errors in broad daylight than errors in prediction at nightfall.Hohwy, J. (2012). Attention and conscious perception in the hypothesis testing brain. Attention and consciousness in different senses, 74. It has recently been proposed that such weighting of prediction errors in proportion to their estimated precision is, in essence, attention,Friston, K. (2009). The free- energy principle: a rough guide to the brain?. Trends in cognitive sciences, 13(7), 293‚Äì301. and that the process of devoting attention may be neurobiologically accomplished by ascending reticular activating systems (ARAS) optimizing the ‚Äúgain‚Äù of prediction error units. =Active inference= The same principle of prediction error minimization has been used to provide an account of behavior in which motor actions are not commands but descending proprioceptive predictions. In this scheme of active inference, classical reflex arcs are coordinated so as to selectively sample sensory input in ways that better fulfill predictions, thereby minimizing proprioceptive prediction errors. Indeed, Adams et al. (2013) review evidence suggesting that this view of hierarchical predictive coding in the motor system provides a principled and neurally plausible framework for explaining the agranular organization of the motor cortex.Adams, R. A., Shipp, S., & Friston, K. J. (2013). Predictions not commands: active inference in the motor system. Brain Structure and Function, 218(3), 611‚Äì643. This view suggests that ‚Äúperceptual and motor systems should not be regarded as separate but instead as a single active inference machine that tries to predict its sensory input in all domains: visual, auditory, somatosensory, interoceptive and, in the case of the motor system, proprioceptive.\\" Neural theory in predictive coding Evaluating the empirical evidence that suggests a neurologically plausible basis for predictive coding is a broad and varied task. For one thing, and according to the model, predictive coding occurs at every iterative step in the perceptual and cognitive processes; accordingly, manifestations of predictive coding in the brain include genetics, specific cytoarchitecture of cells, systemic networks of neurons, and whole brain analyses. Due to this range of specificity, different methods of investigating the neural mechanisms of predictive coding have been applied, where available; more generally, however, and at least as it relates to humans, there are significant methodological limitations to investigating the potential evidence and much of the work is based on computational modeling of microcircuits in the brain. Notwithstanding, there has been substantial (theoretical) work that has been applied to understanding predictive coding mechanisms in the brain. This section will focus on specific evidence as it relates to the predictive coding phenomenon, rather than analogues, such as homeostasis (which are, nonetheless, integral to our overall understanding of Bayesian inference but already supported heavily; see Clark for a review). Much of the early work that applied a predictive coding framework to neural mechanisms came from sensory neurons, particularly in the visual cortex.Bolz, J., & Gilbert, C. D. (1986). Generation of end-inhibition in the visual cortex via interlaminar connections. More generally, however, what seems to be required by the theory are (at least) two types of neurons (at every level of the perceptual hierarchy): one set of neurons that encode incoming sensory input, so called feed-forward projections; one set of neurons that send down predictions, so called feed-backward projections. It is important to note that these neurons must also carry properties of error detection; which class of neurons has these properties is still up for debate.Seth, A. K. (2013). Interoceptive inference, emotion, and the embodied self. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 17(11), 565‚Äì573. These sort of neurons have found support in superficial and non-superficial pyramidal neurons. At a more whole-brain level, there is evidence that different cortical layers (aka laminae) may facilitate the integration of feedforward and feed-backward projections across hierarchies. These cortical layers, divided into granular, agranular, and dysgranular, which house the subpopulations of neurons mentioned above, are divided into 6 main layers. The cytoarchitecture within these layers are the same, but they differ across layers. For example, layer 4 of the granular cortex contain granule cells which are excitatory and distribute thalamocortical inputs to the rest of the cortex. According to one model: > ‚Äú...prediction neurons... in deep layers of agranular cortex drive active > inference by sending sensory predictions via projections ...to supragranular > layers of dysgranular and granular sensory cortices. Prediction-error > neurons ‚Ä¶.in the supragranular layers of granular cortex compute the > difference between the predicted and received sensory signal, and send > prediction-error signals via projections...back to the deep layers of > agranular cortical regions. Precision cells ‚Ä¶ tune the gain on predictions > and prediction error dynamically, thereby giving these signals reduced (or, > in some cases, greater) weight depending on the relative confidence in the > descending predictions or the reliability of incoming sensory > signals.‚ÄùBarrett, L. F., & Simmons, W. K. (2015). Interoceptive predictions > in the brain. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 16(7), 419‚Äì429. In sum, the neural evidence is still in its infancy. Applying predictive coding =Perception= The empirical evidence for predictive coding is most robust for perceptual processing. As early as 1999, Rao and Ballard proposed a hierarchical visual processing model in which higher-order visual cortical area sends down predictions and the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities. According to this model, each level in the hierarchical model network (except the lowest level, which represents the image) attempts to predict the responses at the next lower level via feedback connections, and the error signal is used to correct the estimate of the input signal at each level concurrently. Emberson et al. established the top-down modulation in infants using a cross-modal audiovisual omission paradigm, determining that even infant brains have expectation about future sensory input that is carried downstream from visual cortices and are capable of expectation-based feedback.Emberson, L. L., Richards, J. E., & Aslin, R. N. (2015). Top-down modulation in the infant brain: Learning-induced expectations rapidly affect the sensory cortex at 6 months. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112(31), 9585‚Äì9590. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data showed that infant occipital cortex responded to unexpected visual omission (with no visual information input) but not to expected visual omission. These results establish that in a hierarchically organized perception system, higher-order neurons send down predictions to lower-order neurons, which in turn sends back up the prediction error signal. =Interoception= There have been several competing models for the role of predictive coding in interoception. In 2013, Anil Seth proposed that our subjective feeling states, otherwise known as emotions, are generated by predictive models that are actively built out of causal interoceptive appraisals. In relation to how we attribute internal states of others to causes, Sasha Ondobaka, James Kilner, and Karl Friston (2015) proposed that the free energy principle requires the brain to produce a continuous series of predictions with the goal of reducing the amount of prediction error that manifests as ‚Äúfree energy‚Äù.Ondobaka, S., Kilner, J., & Friston, K. (2017). The role of interoceptive inference in theory of mind. Brain and Cognition, 112, 64‚Äì68. These errors are then used to model anticipatory information about what the state of the outside world will be and attributions of causes of that world state, including understanding of causes of others‚Äô behavior. This is especially necessary because, to create these attributions, our multimodal sensory systems need interoceptive predictions to organize themselves. Therefore, Ondobaka posits that predictive coding is key to understanding other people's internal states. In 2015, Lisa Feldman Barrett and W. Kyle Simmons (2015) proposed the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, a framework that unifies Bayesian active inference principles with a physiological framework of corticocortical connections. Using this model, they posited that agranular visceromotor cortices are responsible for generating predictions about interoception, thus, defining the experience of interoception. In 2017, contrary to the inductive notion that emotion categories are biologically distinct, Barrett (2017) proposed the theory of constructed emotion, which is the account that a biological emotion category is constructed based on a conceptual category‚Äîthe accumulation of instances sharing a goal.Barrett, L. F. (2017). The theory of constructed emotion: An active inference account of interoception and categorization. Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 12(1), 1‚Äì23. Barrett, L.F. (2017). How emotions are made: The secret life of the brain. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. In a predictive coding model, Barrett hypothesizes that, in interoception, our brains regulate our bodies by activating \\"embodied simulations\\" (full-bodied representations of sensory experience) to anticipate what our brains predict that the external world will throw at us sensorially and how we will respond to it with action. These simulations are either preserved if, based on our brain's predictions, they prepare us well for what actually subsequently occurs in the external world, or they, and our predictions, are adjusted to compensate for their error in comparison to what actually occurs in the external world and how well-prepared we were for it. Then, in a trial-error- adjust process, our bodies find similarities in goals among certain successful anticipatory simulations and group them together under conceptual categories. Every time a new experience arises, our brains use this past trial-error- adjust history to match the new experience to one of the categories of accumulated corrected simulations that is shares the most similarity with. Then, they apply the corrected simulation of that category to the new experience in the hopes of preparing our bodies for the rest of the experience. If it does not, the prediction, the simulation, and perhaps the boundaries of the conceptual category are revised in the hopes of higher accuracy next time, and the process continues. Barrett hypothesizes that, when prediction error for a certain category of simulations for x-like experiences is minimized, what results is a correction-informed simulation that the body will reenact for every x-like experience, resulting in a correction-informed full-bodied representation of sensory experience‚Äîan emotion. In this sense, Barrett proposes that we construct our emotions because the conceptual category framework our brains use to compare new experiences, and to pick the appropriate predictive sensory simulation to activate, is built on the go. =Challenges= As a mechanistic theory, predictive coding has not been mapped out physiologically on the neuronal level. One of the biggest challenges to the theory has been the imprecision of exactly how prediction error minimization works.Kogo, N., & Trengove, C. (2015). Is predictive coding theory articulated enough to be testable? Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, 9, 111. In some studies, the increase in BOLD signal has been interpreted as error signal while in others it indicates changes in the input representation. A crucial question that needs to be addressed is what exactly constitutes error signal and how it is computed at each level of information processing.Bastos, A. M., Usrey, W. M., Adams, R. A., Mangun, G. R., Fries, P., & Friston, K. J. (2012). Canonical microcircuits for predictive coding. Neuron 76, 695‚Äì711. Another challenge that has been posed is predictive coding's computational tractability. According to Kwisthout and van Rooij, the subcomputation in each level of the predictive coding framework potentially hides a computationally intractable problem, which amounts to ‚Äúintractable hurdles‚Äù that computational modelers have yet to overcome.Kwisthout, J., van Rooij, I.

But They Might Do More Harm Than Good , Fortune (November 20, 2019). (; ) is a United States federal law that requires the U.S. government to impose sanctions against Mainland China and Hong Kong officials considered responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong, and requires the United States Department of State and other agencies to conduct an annual review to determine whether changes in Hong Kong's political status (its relationship with mainland China) justify changing the unique, favorable trade relations between the U.S. and Hong Kong. The passage of the bill was supported by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, and in 2019 received near-unanimous support in Congress.Simon Denyer & Tiffany Liang, China says Trump is on 'edge of precipice' as Hong Kong rights bill hits his desk , Washington Post (November 21, 2019). Initially introduced in 2014 following the Umbrella Movement and 2014 democracy protests in Hong Kong, the legislation was re-introduced to the next three successive Congresses, but did not gain a vote until 2019, following the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill proposal and the ensuing protests against it. A House version of the bill unanimously passed in the United States House of Representatives through a voice vote in October 2019. In November 2019, the Senate version of the bill, with amendments that differ from the House bill, unanimously passed the Senate on a voice vote. The House accepted the Senate version of the bill later that month, sending it to the desk of President Donald Trump, who signed it one week later. The bill was accompanied by a companion bill restricting U.S. exports of crowd control devices to the Hong Kong police forces, which passed both chambers of Congress unanimously and signed by Trump on the same occasion. Legislative history =2014‚Äì2018= The bill was initially introduced in 2014 during the 113th Congress as an amendment to the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, following the Umbrella Movement and 2014 democracy protests in Hong Kong. The House bill (H.R. 5696) was sponsored by Republican Representative Chris Smith (R-NJ), while the Senate bill (S.2922) was sponsored by Sherrod Brown (D-OH). The act stated that it was U.S. policy to: \\"(1) reaffirm the principles set forth in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992; (2) support the democratic aspirations of the people of Hong Kong; (3) urge China's government to uphold its commitments to Hong Kong; (4) support the establishment by 2017 of a democratic option to nominate and elect the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, and the establishment by 2020 of democratic elections for all members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council; and (5) support freedom of the press.\\" The act was reintroduced into the next two proceeding sessions of Congress: in the 114th Congress as H.R. 1159 and S. 3469, and in the 115th Congress as H.R. 3856 and S. 417. =2019= The 2019 Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act was introduced during the 116th Congress, and gained traction in light of the 2019 Hong Kong extradition bill proposal and the ensuing protests against it; House bill (H.R.3289 ) was sponsored by Jim McGovern (D-MA) and Chris Smith (R-NJ) while the Senate bill (S.1838) was sponsored by Marco Rubio (R-FL). Co-sponsors for the House bill included Tom Suozzi (D-NY), Scott Perry (R-PA), Brad Sherman (D-CA), and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA). Co-sponsors for the Senate bill included Jim Risch (R-ID), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Angus King (I-ME), Ed Markey (D-MA), and Josh Hawley (R-MO). On October 15, 2019, the House version of the bill unanimously passed in a voice vote in the House of Representatives. On November 14, 2019, Senators Jim Risch and Marco Rubio began a process for the United States Senate to pass the legislation by unanimous voice vote. The bill acquired 50 sponsors on November 18, 2019, all but guaranteeing its passage. The bill passed the Senate via unanimous consent on November 19, 2019, with amendments that differed between the two versions. On November 20, 2019, the House passed the Senate version of the Act on a 417‚Äì1 vote. Congressman Thomas Massie (R-KY) was the lone dissenting vote. The House passed the Senate version in order to expedite the process. The passage of the bills by both chambers sent the legislation to President Donald Trump. In an appearance on Fox & Friends shortly after the bill's passage, Trump said that he might veto the bill, saying that it might impact his talks with China over the U.S.-China trade war, saying, \\"We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I'm also standing with President Xi ; he's a friend of mine.\\"David J. Lynch, Trump says he might veto legislation that aims to protect human rights in Hong Kong because bill could affect China trade talks , Washington Post (November 22, 2019). Trump signed the bill on November 27, 2019. As he was signing the bill, Trump issued a signing statement hedging his support, saying that \\"certain provisions of the Act,\\" which he did not specify, \\"would interfere with the exercise of the President‚Äôs constitutional authority to state the foreign policy of the United States,\\" and that his administration would \\"treat each of the provisions of the act consistently with the president's constitutional authorities with respect to foreign relations.\\"Emily Cochrane, Edward Wong & Keith Bradsher, Trump Signs Hong Kong Democracy Legislation, Angering China , New York Times (November 27, 2019).Statement by the President, White House Press Office (November 27, 2019). In response, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer wrote, \\"Decency, humanity, and the rule of law compel you to enforce it. Stop playing games.\\" Provisions of the act The Act is divided into ten sections: *Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents *Sec. 2. Definitions *Sec. 3. Statement of policy *Sec. 4. Amendments to the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 *Sec. 5. Annual report on violations of United States export control laws and United Nations sanctions occurring in Hong Kong. *Sec. 6. Protecting United States citizens and others from rendition to the People's Republic of China. *Sec. 7. Sanctions relating to undermining fundamental freedoms and autonomy in Hong Kong. *Sec. 8. Sanctions reports. *Sec. 9. Sense of Congress on People's Republic of China state-controlled media. *Sec. 10. Sense of Congress on commercial exports of crowd control equipment to Hong Kong. The HKHRDA directed various departments to assess whether political developments in Hong Kong justify changing Hong Kong's unique treatment under U.S. law, and specifically: *Requires the Secretary of State to issue an annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy to justify special treatment afforded to Hong Kong by the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. *Requires the President to identify, and impose sanctions against, persons responsible for the abductions of Hong Kong booksellers and journalists and those complicit in suppressing basic freedoms in Hong Kong, including those complicit in the rendition of individuals, in connection to their exercise of internationally recognized rights, to mainland China for detention or trial. Sanctions against officials responsible for human rights abuses in Hong Kong would include asset freezesExplainer: U.S. Legislation on Hong Kong: What Does It Mean? , Reuters (November 21, 2019). under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as well as visa bans, including the denial of visa applications to travel in the United States and the revocation of existing visas. *Requires the President to issue a strategy to protect U.S. citizens and businesses from the risks posed by a revised Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, including by determining whether to revise the U.S.‚ÄìHong Kong extradition agreement and the State Department's travel advisory for Hong Kong. *Requires the Secretary of Commerce to issue an annual report assessing whether the government of Hong Kong is adequately enforcing both U.S. export regulations regarding sensitive dual-use items and U.S. and U.N. sanctions, particularly regarding Iran and North Korea. *Makes clear that visa applicants shall not be denied visas on the basis of the applicant's arrest, detention or other adverse government action taken as a result of their participation in the protest activities related to pro-democracy advocacy, human rights, or the rule of law in Hong Kong. The application of targeted sanctions directed by the Act is modeled after similar provisions in the Magnitsky Act and the Global Magnitsky Act.Julian Ku, The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act Is Redundant, but Still Worthwhile, Lawfare (November 25, 2019). Legal scholar Julian Ku notes that the sanctions provision of the HKHRDA \\"may be read to require the president to impose targeted individual sanctions\\" because the legislation states that the president \\"shall\\" impose sanctions against individuals determined to have violated the act's human rights provisions. Ku notes, however, that because the HKHRDA \\"gives the president the power to 'determine' who has violated those human rights obligations\\" the president might 'refuse to designate anyone as an HKHRDA human rights offender, even if there is substantial evidence of that person's violations.\\" Ku suggests that \\"this legal ambiguity as to whether the president can simply refuse to designate anyone as violating the HKHRDA's targeted sanctions provisions could become an area of intrabranch conflict if the White House refuses to exercise its authority under this section.\\" Reactions =U.S. newspaper editorials= The editorial boards of several U.S. newspapers called for passage of the Act, including USA Today,With Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, U.S. Congress stands up to China , USA Today (November 21, 2019). The Dallas Morning News, The New York Times,Editorial Board, Hong Kong Voted. Is Beijing Listening?, New York Times (November 25, 2019). New York Post, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal.Editorial Board, Hong Kong's Freedom Message: Trump should sign Congress's rights and democracy legislation, Wall Street Journal (November 24, 2019). =Hong Kong pro-democracy movement= Hong Kong protesters against the extradition bill and members from the Hong Kong pro- democracy camp have called for the passage of the Act.Some relevant sources include:   Activists Denise Ho and Joshua Wong appeared before the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) in September 2019 where they urged sitting congresspersons to support the bill and rejected the suggestion that the bill constituted an inappropriate U.S. involvement in another country's affairs. Wong and his fellow Demosisto activist Jeffrey Ngo urged passage of the bill in a 2017 op-ed in the Washington Post.Joshua Wong & Jeffrey Ngo, Stand Up for Democracy in Hong Kong , New York Times (May 3, 2017). One day after the bill's passage on November 27, pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong celebrated the new law and held a pro-American rally. At the rally, held on U.S. Thanksgiving Day, Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Nathan Law called the law a \\"timely Thanksgiving present.\\" Thousands of activists at the \\"Thanksgiving Rally\\" waved American flags and sang The Star-Spangled Banner, the U.S. national anthem, expressing gratitude to the United States, Congress and President Trump for passing the law. =Academics= Julian Ku, a legal scholar at Hofstra University School of Law, called the HKHRDA \\"redundant, but still worthwhile.\\" Ku wrote: Academics supporting the Act include Larry Diamond, Tom Campbell, Alexander G√∂rlach, and James Carafano. In a commentary on Lawfare, Alvin Y.H. Cheung noted that despite \\"vocal backing from some Hong Kongers, and widespread support within Congress, the bill was not nearly as popular with longtime China hands in the United States.\\" For example, Susan Thornton, a senior fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale University who previously served as acting Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs under the Trump administration, called the act a \\"huge mistake\\" that would hurt Hongkongers and play into the hands of Beijing. Cheung was critical of this view, arguing that past U.S. policy toward Hong Kong had failed to stop the Chinese government from diminishing Hong Kong's autonomy and undercutting the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle. William Lam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong said that while Trump was unlikely to impose sanctions because of his interest in negotiating a U.S.-China trade deal, the protesters had \\"won a very important moral victory\\" given the law's near-unanimous passage through Congress. =Business interests= The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham) has said that anything that changes the status of Hong Kong 'would have a chilling effect not only on U.S. trade and investment in Hong Kong but would send negative signals internationally about Hong Kong's trusted position in the global economy.\\" An analyst with the Eurasia Group and academic at Peking University both opined that the passage of the act did not affect the extant and concurrent negotiations between the United States and People's Republic of China to resolve their trade war. =Chinese and Hong Kong governments= China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang responded that the bill \\"fully reveals the ill intentions of some people in the United States to mess up Hong Kong and contain China's development.\\" The managing director of a Hong Kong pro-democracy group said through a statement sent to Newsweek that the foreign ministry's response showed that the PRC was \\"sensitive and susceptible to international pressure.\\" Beijing and state media in mainland China, such as the official Communist Party newspaper People's Daily, condemned the move and said the country would take countermeasures with the editor-in-chief of the state-run, nationalistic Global Times, warning that China could bar the HKHRDA's drafters from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau.Keith Bradsher, Javier C. Hern√°ndez & Alexandra Stevenson, China Condemns U.S. Over Hong Kong. That Won‚Äôt Stop Trade Talks , New York Times (November 28, 2019). Experts said that Beijing's desire to prioritize a resolution to its trade war with the United States limited the retaliatory measures that it could (and eventually did) undertake. The Hong Kong government criticized the legislation, calling it \\"unnecessary and unwarranted\\" and an interference into the internal affairs of Hong Kong; this position was criticized by the act's supporters. Chinese retaliation following enactment of the HKHRDA On December 2, 2019, the Chinese government retaliated against the U.S. for the passage of the HKHRDA by suspending visits of U.S. naval vessels and U.S. military aircraft to Hong Kong and by sanctioning several U.S.-based NGOs (including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, and the International Republican Institute), whom the Chinese government allege orchestrated the Hong Kong protests.Amy Qin, China Hits Back at U.S. Over Hong Kong Bill in a Mostly Symbolic Move , New York Times (December 2, 2019).China bars U.S. military ships, aircraft from Hong Kong, sanctions U.S.-based NGOs , Reuters (December 2, 2019). These steps were mostly symbolic. During previous periods of heightened U.S.-China tensions, the Chinese government had previously suspended U.S. warships from visiting Hong Kong. China also already tightly restricted the activities of foreign NGOs in China, particularly since 2016, and most of the NGOs sanctioned by China do not operate on the mainland. A U.S. State Department official said that \\"false accusations of foreign interference\\" against U.S.-based NGOs were \\"intended to distract from the legitimate concerns of Hongkongers.\\" In the aftermath of the HKHRDA's passage, officials denied entry to Macau to a number of Hong Kong residents, journalists, and foreigners, including the heads of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.Joyce Zhou & Farah Master, Chinese leader Xi visits gambling hub Macau as nearby Hong Kong seethes , Reuters (December 17, 2019).Alvin Lum, Heads of influential American business group in Hong Kong denied entry to Macau after opposition to extradition bill , South China Morning Post (December 7, 2019).Steven Lee Myers, In Macau, China Sees a Model for a Rebellious Hong Kong , New York Times (December 18, 2019). =U.S. Congress= The act received near-unanimous support in Congress, and was seen as a \\"remarkable display of bipartisan unity\\" in an otherwise highly polarized political environment. In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) described the HKHRDA as a reaffirmation of \\"America's commitment to democracy and human rights and the rule of law in the face of Beijing's crackdown.\\"Haley Byrd, Hong Kong bills go to Trump after passing House and Senate , CNN (November 21, 2019). House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and ranking member Michael McCaul (R-TX) both issued statements strongly supporting the act,US Congress inches closer to passing Hong Kong human rights bill , Al Jazeera (September 26, 2019). as did Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jim Risch (R-ID)Doug Palmer, Senate passes bill in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters , Politico (November 19, 2019). and ranking member Bob Menendez (D-NJ).Jonathan D. Salant, Trump gets bill championed by N.J. Republican to stand with Hong Kong protesters, NJ Advance Media (November 20, 2019). Representative Chris Smith, one of the initial sponsors of the House bill, dismissed as \\"cowardly propaganda\\" the suggestion that passage of the act would bolster the Chinese government's efforts to depict the Hong Kong protests as \\"rioting\\" directed by the West. =International= Following the passage of the HKHRDA in the United States, activists for Hong Kong democracy called upon Canada to adopt similar legislation. *Maham Abedi, Hong Kong activist calls on Canada to take a stronger stance after U.S. passes laws , GlobalNews.ca (November 29, 2019). *Crystal Tai, Campaigners urge Canada's Trudeau to adopt US-style Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act , South China Morning Post (October 28, 2019). *Steven Chase, Hong Kong activists appeal to Canada to probe violence, enact sanctions on leaders , Globe & Mail (November 27, 2019). Related bill A separate bill, , , passed by Congress at the same time as the HKHRDA, banned the export of certain types of crowd control munitions‚Äîspecifically, \\"tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, foam rounds, bean bag rounds, pepper balls, water cannons, handcuffs, shackles, stun guns, and tasers\\"‚Äîfrom the U.S. to the Hong Kong Police Force and Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force. The legislation passed the House on a 417‚Äì0 and the Senate by unanimous consent. *S.2710 ‚Äì A bill to prohibit the commercial export of covered munitions items to the Hong Kong Police Force, 116th Congress (2019‚Äì2020), Congress.gov. *Doug Palmer, House sends bill supporting Hong Kong protesters to Trump , Politico (November 20, 2019). President Trump also signed S. 2710 on November 27, 2019. The act has a sunset clause providing that the prohibition expires one year after enactment. Aftermath =HKHRDA as a candidacy criteria in 2020 Hong Kong legislative election= HKHRDA has become one of the concerns regarding the candidacy criteria of the 2020 Hong Kong legislative election. Pro-democracy candidate Ventus Lau was being asked by the electoral officer Amy Yeung(Ê•äËïôÂøÉ) regarding his stance on HKHRDA. Yeung asked if Lau would continue urging the sanction of US towards Hong Kong, and judged that Lau was utilizing foreign power to influence Hong Kong. She continued by asking how Lau could fulfil the requirement of being loyal to HKSAR and the Basic Law.

The father, Constantin Zureiq, was a historian and a leading force in contemporary Arab thought. The daughter, Afaf, is an artist.

Custom Filipinos commemorate the birth of Saint John, who cleansed and prepared the people for the coming of Jesus Christ by baptizing them with water. Along with the birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary, John the Baptist‚Äôs birthday is the only one celebrated; most other saints are remembered on the day of their death or some other important date. Matthew 3:11 quotes Saint John as saying: \\"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire.\\" Children and grown-ups alike line up the streets and generously douse passersby or unsuspecting commuters and visitors with water, with the traditional ‚Äúbasaan‚Äù or \\"buhusan\\" (dousing of water)- supposedly to remind them of their baptism. They also enjoy engaging in water wars and other wet games using dippers, pails, hoses and even water pistols. Older persons my fill their ancient coconut shells with perfumed water to sprinkle on passersby. In rural areas, people take a swim at the beach, in a nearby river, or at a local spring, believing that a little exposure to water today, even just a sprinkle or splash, will bring God's blessings. This popular custom is practiced as they recall San Juan's life and mission. That is why in some places, passing buses, cars, and jeeps become the targets of water splashed and thrown about with reckless gusto. Filipinos from different parts of the country celebrate this feast in various ways.

He married Ann Whittlesey, and had adopted a son, also named Charles, who survived him.Alexandria Gazette obituary December 9, 1874 Military, publishing and Virginia career During the American Civil War, Whittlesey recruited infantry Company I, of the 22nd Connecticut volunteers, and served as its captain.His draft registration records show his occupation as \\"druggist\\" not \\"lawyer\\". U.S. Civil War Draft Registration Records 1863-1865, for Connecticut, Vol3 of 4 After being mustered out of the army, Whittlesey remained in Alexandria, Virginia, where he practiced law. He also edited the Alexandria Virginia State Journal, then moved to Richmond, Virginia (which had once again become the state capital) and renamed it the Richmond State Journal. Whittlesey also participated in the April 17, 1867 meeting of Republicans at Richmond's First African Baptist Church.Richard G. Lowe, Republicans and Reconstruction in Virginia 1856-70 (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia 1991) pp. 77-78, 162 As Congressional Reconstruction was ending, General Edward Richard Sprigg Canby (who had succeeded Gen. John Schofield as governor of Military District No. 1 upon Schofield's promotion to Secretary of War) appointed Whittlesey Attorney General. Whittlesey held that position for about three months (September 10, 1869 until January 19, 1870, a week before Congress officially restored Virginia to the Union and seated her Senators and Congressmen). During the 1869 election, Whittlesey was the Republican candidate for U.S. Congress from Virginia's 7th District, but lost to Conservative Lewis McKenzie. After Gen. Canby removed Whittlesey from office, he continued to practice law in Richmond. Gen. Canby appointed James Craig Taylor to succeed him as appointed attorney general, since he was elected to that position in November and thus started his term early. Death and legacy Whittlesey died at his Alexandria home of Bright's disease.Alexandria Gazette obituary His widow applied for and received a pension in Washington D.C. in 1893.U.S. Civil War Pension index for Charles Whittlesey, application made on January 28, 1893 no. 569,365, certificate no. 373,399 filed in D.C. indicates his widow's name as \\"Helen\\" although the contemporary obituary lists her name as \\"Ann\\" His body was returned for burial in Spring Grove Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.

As with similar greenhoods, plants in flower differ from those that are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground, but the plants in flower have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. In this species, the flower is green and reddish brown with a protruding sinus and small club-like tips on the ends of the lateral sepals. Description Pterostylis atrans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of egg-shaped leaves, each leaf 10‚Äì35 mm long and 10‚Äì30 mm wide. Flowering plants have a single flower 14‚Äì20 mm long and 10‚Äì12 mm wide borne on a spike 150‚Äì300 mm high with between three and five spreading stem leaves. The flowers are green with a reddish- brown, down curved tip. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column and the dorsal sepal has a thread-like tip 6‚Äì9 mm long. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have erect, thread-like tips 15‚Äì20 mm long with small club-like tips and a protruding, platform-like sinus between their bases. The labellum is 9‚Äì11 mm long, about 3 mm wide, green with a blunt brown tip that is just visible above the sinus. Flowering occurs from November to April.  Taxonomy and naming  Pterostylis atrans was first formally described in 1994 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Brindabella Range. The description was published in Muelleria.

She founded the first school for Indigenous children in Western Australia, called Annesfield. Biography Camfield was born in about 1808. Her father was said to have manufactured pottery in Staffordshire. At this time women were rarely missionaries but Anne was accepted as a governess who would travel to Australia with the Reverend William Mitchell and his family. Their travel was under the auspices of the Colonial and Continental Church Society.Groves, J. (2006). The Camfields : \\"The Comforts of Civilisation\\" in Early Colonial Western Australia. Retrieved from http://ro.ecu.edu.au/theses_hons/126 They arrived in the Swan River Colony, Western Australia, on board the Shepherd on 4 August 1838. Mitchell established a mission school at Middle Swan for settlers' children and Aboriginal children, with Breeze assisting. She married Henry Camfield on 19 December 1840 at St. Mary's Church, Middle Swan. Henry had been in Australia since 1829 and had a land grant named Burrswood that he rented out for fifty pounds a year. In 1847 her husband was appointed Resident Magistrate at Albany, which at the time had a European population of about 250. The job carried a salary of ¬£200 a year. The following year Albany opened its first church with John Ramsden Wollaston as chaplain. He was a friend of the Camfield's although the new chaplain regarded Henry as too weak for his job. The new church was inspected by Bishop Short and his archdeacon Matthew Hale. Hale would in time become Bishop of Perth and he and Anne corresponded with each other for several decades. Camfield with Bessie Flower Camfield House was constructed in 1852 as a residence for them and it was also known as Annesfield. Wollaston like Anne was concerned about young aboriginal children and he wrote to the colonial secretary noting that the Camfield's new house had space to let and that Anne was willing to take six children into her house. Wollaston was able to secure a grant from Governor Fitzgerald. Money arrived and as the facility grew then so did the requirements. Staff were employed although the Camfield and their assistant Lucy were the core force. Although the Camfields received no salary until 1861. Another building built in 1858 was a purpose built school house built for more Aboriginal children. The school continued under the auspices of Wollaston and Anne Camfield. The school was focused on educating Indigenous children. One of Anne Camfield's student's was Bessie Flower who went on to study in Sydney and returned to teach. Bessie would eventually leave to gain further experience, but she never returned. Camfield was a photographer and she is thought to have sent a picture of Hali and his Sister to the London International Exhibition in 1862. There appears to have been no official entry from South Australia and Camfield was awarded an honourable mention. In 1871 a Select Committee reported on the Aboriginal Natives. They summarised Anne Camfield's evidence saying \\"One girl, sent to Sydney, played for some time the harmonium in St. Philip‚Äôs Church, and gained her living by teaching...\\".‚ÄúHandbook of Western Australia‚Äù, C G Nicolay, 1880 Camfield was forced to give up the school in March of that year because of poor health. The following year her husband died. Camfield eventually moved to South Australia to live with her adoptive daughter, where she died aged 88.

Together with the more famous Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu, Gongsun was one of the earliest proponents of Confucianism, setting in motion its emergence under the Han court. The ideals both promoted, together with Gongsun's decrees, would come to be seen as values-in-themselves, becoming the \\"basic elements, or even hallmarks\\" of Confucianism. While first proposed and more ardently promoted by Dong, the national academy (then considered radical) and Imperial examination did not come into existence until they were supported by the more successful Gongsun. Their establishment set a precedent that would last into the twentieth century. Beginning his political career at age sixty, Gongsun rapidly advanced from commoner to attain a senior appointment in 130BC when he was seventy, becoming grand secretary in 126 and chancellor in 124. One of the Three Dukes, in recognition of canonical mastery he was probably the first Han Confucian to be appointed to high office, the first commoner and first (and only, out of twelve of the time) Confucian to be made chancellor, as well as the first chancellor to be made marquis. He set a precedent for Confucianism as interpreter of portents. Background Preceding emperors, being more aligned with Huang-Lao, had instituted a policy of general non-interference with the people, reducing tax and other burdens, promoting government thrift and reduction in criminal sentences. A major issue however was the power possessed by princes of collateral lines of the imperial clan. The princes often built up their own military strengths and resisted edicts issued by the emperor. Emperor Wen's time saw the L√º Clan Disturbance, but he did not take any decisive actions on the overarching issue. His successor Emperor Jing managed to crush a revolt of the princes who were thereafter denied rights to appoint ministers for their fiefs, but their power persisted. Sima Qian states Gongsun's background as that of a prison officer, who being dismissed, made his living as a farmhand tending pigs. Sima characterizes Gong (like Dong Zhongshu) as specializing in the Spring and Autumn Annals, but with a bent toward the Gongyang Zhuan commentaries as a disciple of Huwu Zidu. However, neither text is referenced in any of Gongsun's documents, and his actions don't seem to reflect the Gongyang. His family being poor, he did not learn much of the Annals until he was forty, and the Shiji considers his ability secondary to that of Dong Zhongshu. Gongsun probably first expressed his views in 134 B.C. after the death of the Taoistic Empress Dowager, in response to a request by the Emperor Wu of Han for governmental advice. He applied to an advanced position in government through court examination. His discourse included ideas from Confucianism, administrative philosophy (Chinese Legalism) and Mohism; namely, that capable people ought to be employed in positions that match their talents (Mohism and Shen Buhai); secondly, encouraging high standards of morality, harmonious relationships, and employing moral persons (Confucianism and Mohism); and that common people should be allowed opportunity for farming while discouraging useless articles (Mohism and Shang Yang). Speech Referring to a typical golden age of the remote past in which the populace was naturally good, reminiscent of Lu Jia and Jia Yi he derides the practice of the Qin (that is, its penalties) as inadequate, stressing the Confucian values of sincerity, humaneness (ren), righteousness (yi), and moderation (li), but also intellectual judgement (zhi) as the means of effective authority. In what may have been the first time in history he evoked the Duke of Zhou (Zhou Gong) in his argument. As an influence on the basics of Confucianism, his stress on guidance through music (which Dong also stressed), li, and the habits of living is notable, while on the other hand he lacked Dong's cosmology. Following this he gave a thinly veiled discourse on the \\"fundamentals of government\\" drawn seemingly straight from the Han Feizi; referring to the techniques (Shu) of government (originating in Shen Buhai), recommending firm personal control of the government, and \\"monopolization of the handles which control life\\" (Han Fei's Two Handles of reward and punishment). His discourse was rated low by the Ceremonial Superintendent, but among the top by the Emperor; though it may have been simple compared with Dong's, Sima writes that it was still very elegant. Gongsun thereby attained the title of academician, leading Dong to claims that he attained high office from the autocratic Emperor through flattery. While Dong did not attain high office, the Han Shu records that Dong's career was still distinguished through the same call to service. Gongsun tried hard to sideline Dong, and would ultimately see his banishing, probably between 126-121BC. By making him chancellor of Weifang, Gongsun effectively prompted Dong's partial retirement from political life, probably paving the way for Gongsun's appropriation and usage of some of his proposals (namely the imperial examination), replacing them with more elaborate proposals. However, Gongsun still apparently preferred Dong's teachings to that of the Scholar Jiang of Xiaqiu. Career According to Sima Qian, beginning his career at age sixty, Gongsun would later end up sent as an envoy to the Xiongnu (northern nomadic confederation). He resigned (\\"because of illness\\") when his opinion on the matter differed from the Emperor's (Emperor Wu), but was brought back on general consensus despite Gongsun's reluctance. Thereafter he rarely disagreed with the emperor openly. At first arguing against it, he argues for Zhufu Yan's proposal for the development of the Shuofang commandery (a defensive position against the Xiongnu) at the expense of efforts to the south, only eventually succeeding. In more legal policy, having began his career as a scholar appointed for his knowledge of the Five Classics, and only later arriving at the legal, Gongsun would embellish the later with the former, greatly pleasing the emperor. Often mentioned together in the Shiji, Gongsun sang the praises of legal clerk Zhang Tang, whose policies needed legitimisation, thereby strengthening each other's positions. Professor Griet Vankeerberghen refer to both him and Zhang as \\"quasi-Legalist bureaucrats\\". They instituted a law along the lines of Shang Yang, present during the Qin dynasty, that punished those with knowledge of a crime that failed to report it, or slandered prosecutors. According to the Taiping Yulan, Gongsun also wrote a highly valuable book on Xing-Ming (personnel selection), the doctrine of Shen Buhai, that may have been extant as late as the tenth century. Servicing the emperor's wishes, they brought the government under tight central control, promoting an autocratic style of government. Eliminating their enemies through execution or transfer, they began what may be termed a political revolution putting a temporary end to group interests in the court, consolidating it with the death of Liu An in Huainan. The demotion of their enemy Ji An is notable, as a powerful representative of the Huang-Lao tradition favouring rich families. Drawing them as infringing on the Emperor's prerogatives and authority, Gongsun implies a comparison between the luxurious indulgence of Ji An's ilk to that of Guan Zhong as usurping the prerogatives of his lord - and is approved. In connection with this Gongsun wore plain clothes and ate plain food, as if to place himself on footing with minor officials or the people. Other cases include Gongsun recommending the corrupt Zhufu Yan for execution (though Gongsun may have been covetous of his favour with the Emperor), and that the harsh official Ning Cheng not be appointed to government office, with the emperor making the latter commandant. Gongsun died of natural causes only a year after the Huainan trials. His son inherited his rank, becoming Grand Administrator of Zhejiang but lost it in a trial. Sima Qian states that he was replaced by Li Ts'ai. Legacy Contrary to Zhang Tang, who promoted his subordinates, Gongsun made no use of his position to advance other Confucians, and likely did not identify with the Confucian community, not hesitating to drive them from office. Michael Loewe states that, though regarded as one of the most respected statesmen, he was actually considered somewhat old- fashioned. Despite his political orientation, because he insisted on the value of trust over either law, rewards or penalties, Vankeerberghen considers Gongsun still reminiscent of Huang-Lao ideology like that of the Taoistic Huainanzi, the book of his opponents. Professor Griet Vankeerberghen considers Gongsun to have promoted the virtues of frugality, modesty and incorruptibility, which might be said to have faded into the background. Pledging allegiance to the Emperor, he was innovative in defining absolutism in moral terms, espousing a conception of loyalty at odds with the times, and new standards of conduct to go with it. Following Gongsun scholars \\"took to supporting monarchical power\\", he and Zhang Tang achieving \\"nothing less than a tilting of the axis of the conventional moral compass toward a more legal- centric orientation.\\" Before Gongsun the selection of officials depended mainly on the judgment of senior officials, and the injunctions of the Emperor, though still referencing character. Only seven percent of officials at the time were Confucian. Gongsun's rapid rise would be celebrated as its success, but apart from attracting opportunists to Confucianism, also saw the ideas of \\"Chinese Legalism\\" work their way into Confucianism, and those espousing \\"Legalist\\" policies counted among their ranks. Many were willing to follow Gongsun, while notable contemporaries like Dong Zhongshu, Ji An and historiographer Sima Qian called him and Zhang Tang flatterers and deceitful hypocrites, Gongsun receiving high salary while wearing simple clothes, and appearing lenient while inwardly uncompromising (\\"a suspicious man, outwardly magnanimous but inwardly scheming... he pretended to be friendly but repaid all wrongs\\" -Sima Qian), and accused him of subverting Confucianism. If nothing else, Gongsun could easily be said to have manipulated the legal system, and generally, did not openly state his own opinion in court (though these could hardly be considered particular to him). Whatever the case, both lived frugal, if not charitable lives and established new standards of conduct. Though utilizing his virtues to further his career, Gongsun was said to be proficient, meticulous, yielding and filial. He was praised for giving away, at times, most of his salary to fellow scholars, to the point of having little left over for his family, only revealing this to the court at the charge of Ji An. After failing to suppress the rebellion in Huainan due to illness he accepted Ji An's criticism of hypocrisy. While Sima states that Gongsun considered himself to have died without achieving merit, the early Later Han historian Ban Gu considered him to have outstanding ability. More recently, Sinologist Homer H. Dubs calls him \\"admirable in personal conduct, able in disputation, capable in legal matters, and an ornament to scholarship\\", while Tu Weiming calls him and Dong the heirs of Shusun Tong.

She was married to American entomologist Vernon Lyman Kellogg. Early life Charlotte Kellogg was born Charlotte Hoffman in 1874 in Grand Island, Nebraska. In 1900 she received a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a member of Gamma Phi Beta.The Crescent of Gamma Phi Beta, October 1918, p. 379. After five years (1903‚Äì1907) as head of the English department at the Anna Head School in Berkeley, California, in 1908 in Florence she married Vernon Lyman Kellogg. Two years later, she gave birth to their only daughter, Jean Kellogg. In 1916 she traveled to Brussels with Jean and worked for a year with the Commission for Relief in Belgium, at the special request of the President. Kellogg studied the women of Belgium and in 1917 published Women of Belgium: Turning Tragedy to Triumph, followed by Bobbins of Belgium (1920). When President Herbert Hoover appointed her husband an assistant to the United States Food Administration, Kellogg joined him in his work as an internationally active war-relief speaker and fund raiser.  Belgium  Some of Kellogg's most notable publications centered around her time spent in Belgium with her husband prior to America's entrance into World War I. Kellogg was sent by Herbert Hoover and the Commission for Relief in Belgium specifically to document the experience and struggles of the women living in Belgium. According to President Herbert Hoover, who authored an introduction to Kellogg's 1917 publication Women of Belgium: Turning Tragedy to Triumph, Kellogg did \\"more than record in simple terms passing impressions of varied facts of the great work of these women, for she spent months in loving sympathy with them.\\" Kellogg also spent extensive time researching the Belgian Lace industry, publishing Bobbins of Belgium; a book of Belgian lace, lace- workers, lace-schools and lace-villages, a unique portrait of the women who worked in this industry, which suffered when Belgium faced occupation and the challenges of world war. During her time abroad, Kellogg developed an intimate relationship with D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier, a notable Belgian scholar and a famous leader in resisting the German occupation of Belgium in 1914‚Äì18. In 1920 Kellogg published a biography of Cardinal Mercier, Mercier, the Fighting Cardinal of Belgium, based on her personal interactions with Mercier and her impression of his personality. This biography contained a foreword by American journalist and diplomat Brand Whitlock who in his foreword to her work wrote that \\"no one is better qualified than [Kellogg] to speak of [Mercier's] courageous work.\\" Her biography of Mercier includes details of his early life and an extensive history of his activism in Belgium, including many anecdotes and direct quotations from speeches and one-on-one conversations.  Marie Curie  Seating chart: Charlotte Kellogg sits to left of Marie Curie at Radium Gifting Ceremony, 20 May 1921, East Wing of Warren G. Harding's White House Marie Curie, having refused to patent her discovery of radium, struggled to raise funds to secure the costly element, in 1921 priced at some US $100,000 per gram. After in 1920 meeting with American journalist Marie Mattingly Meloney for a rare interview during which she spoke of her research needs, Curie agreed to visit the United States to receive a gift of radium, which Meloney promised to procure. Meloney and Kellogg, along with many other American women, facilitated a 1921 grass-roots campaign \\"to raise money to make a gift to Madame Curie on the occasion of her visit of a gram of radium for exclusive use in experimental work.\\"Kellogg, Charlotte.

Kellogg later recounted that, aboard ship to and from France, Curie worked on her Life of Pierre Curie, which Kellogg assisted in translating. Kellogg and Curie remained in contact until Curie's death in 1934. Much of their correspondence is preserved in the University of Chicago Library Special Collections.

Established in March 1944, it was composed of government and SS personnel, as well as representatives of the aircraft manufacturers. The task force played a key role in the Emergency Fighter Program, including the \\"people's fighter\\" Heinkel He 162. The J√§gerstab increased the exploitation of slave labour for the benefit of Germany's industry and its air force, the Luftwaffe. It was one of the impetuses for the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz, so that the able-bodied Jews could be used for aircraft production. Background and formation In early 1944, the Allies focused on the destruction of the Luftwaffe in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. Plans for the Big Week, intended to destroy Germany's capacity to produce fighter aircraft through targeted airstrikes on final assembly factories, were already underway in 1943. Between February 20‚Äì25, 1944, approximately 10,000 American and British aircraft, including about 6,000 bombers, attacked strategic targets across Germany. The attacks seriously damaged the German aircraft industry, and production rates fell drastically. In response, Adolf Hitler authorized the creation of the J√§gerstab, which superseded the Reich Aviation Ministry with the aim of increasing fighter aircraft production. The task force was established by Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments and War Production in the Hitler Cabinet, with support from Erhard Milch of the Reich Aviation Ministry. While Speer and Milch played a key role in directing the activities of the agency, the day-to-day operations were handled by Chief of Staff Karl Saur, a previous head of the Technical Office in the Armaments Ministry. Activities and use of slave labour The organisation consisted of multiple committees, including the Airframes Main Committee, Equipment Main Committee and Development Main Committee, that coordinated the work on the development of new aircraft as part of the Emergency Fighter Program. The Airframes Main Committee was chaired by Karl Frydag, who was also a deputy chair of the Development Main Committee and oversaw the day-to-day development and production activities relating to the Heinkel He 162, the Volksj√§ger (\\"people's fighter\\"). The J√§gerstab was given extraordinary powers over labour, production and transportation resources; its functions took priority over housing repairs for bombed out civilians and restoration of vital city services. The factories that came under J√§gerstab control saw their work-weeks extended to 72 hours. At the same time, Milch took steps to rationalise production by reducing the number of variants of each type of aircraft produced. Hungarian Jewish women selected for slave labour at Auschwitz The task force immediately began implementing plans to expand the use of slave labour in the aviation industry. On 9 March 1944, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, informed the Aviation Minister and head of the Air Force Hermann G√∂ring that the SS would provide 100,000 prisoners to move aircraft production underground. These prisoners were to be obtained by deporting Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz as part of Operation H√∂ss. The need for labor to increase fighter production was used to justify the deportations to the Hungarian government. Of the 437,000 Hungarian Jews deported between May and July 1944, about 320,000 were gassed on arrival at Auschwitz and the remainder forced to work. Only about 50,000 survived. The plan to protect the aircraft industry, especially the manufacture of the jet-powered Messerschmitt Me 262, required relocating assembly plants to underground bunkers. A similar proposal had been considered in October 1943, but was never realized. The J√§gerstabs original plan included six locations, but by June 1944 the Allied landing in Normandy had forced the J√§gerstab to focus on two locations in Upper Bavaria. Three bunkers were to be built at Kaufering concentration camp in the Landsberg am Lech district, and the code name \\"Weingut I\\" (Vineyard I) was chosen for the factory in the M√ºhldorf concentration camp complex. Records show that SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects at the peak of J√§gerstabs construction activities. Taking into account the high mortality rate associated with the underground construction projects, the historian Marc Buggeln estimates that the workforce involved amounted to 80,000‚àí90,000 inmates. They belonged to the various sub-camps including Mittelbau-Dora, Mauthausen-Gusen and Buchenwald. The prisoners worked for manufacturers such as Junkers, Messerschmitt, Henschel and BMW. Results The last remaining arch of Weingut I, one of seven that were completed out of a planned twelve. The progress achieved by the J√§gerstab was seen as a success by the German authorities. From February‚ÄìJuly 1944, the production of the Fw 190 and Me 109 fighters increased 150 percent. The cooperation between the Reich Ministry of Aviation, the Ministry of Armaments and the SS proved especially productive. Although intended to function for only six months, Speer and Milch discussed with Goring in late May the possibility of centralising all of Germany's arms manufacturing under a similar task force. On 1 August 1944, Speer reorganised the task force into the R√ºstungsstab (Armament Staff) to apply the same model of operation to all top-priority armament programs. The new task force assumed responsibilities for the J√§gerstab underground transfer projects.

He played college baseball for the University of Houston Cougars and was drafted by the Nationals in the first round of the 2017 Major League Baseball Draft. Career =Amateur career= Romero attended Columbia High School in West Columbia, Texas. As a senior, he had a 1.35 earned run average (ERA) with 131 strikeouts over 62 innings. He was not drafted coming out of high school and attended the University of Houston where he played college baseball for the Cougars. As a freshman at Houston in 2015, Romero appeared in 22 games and made eight starts. He had a 7‚Äì4 record with a 1.94 ERA, 92 strikeouts and seven saves. Prior to his sophomore season in 2016, he was suspended indefinitely for \\"conduct detrimental to the team\\", described in media reports as poor physical conditioning. He returned from the suspension after missing two starts, crediting his weight loss to the work of Houston strength and conditioning coach Ryan Deatrick, and appeared in 15 games with 13 starts. He finished 6‚Äì4 with a 2.29 ERA and 113 strikeouts. As a junior in April 2017, Romero was suspended by the team for a second time, reportedly after failing a drug test, missing curfew, and being photographed in uniform holding a bong. At the time of the suspension, he was 3‚Äì3 with a 3.03 ERA and was leading the nation with 76 strikeouts. He was re-instated in May. However, Romero played just two games after being reinstated before he was dismissed from the team. The Houston Chronicle reported Romero had been involved in a fight with a teammate, precipitating his final dismissal from the team after a series of previous disciplinary incidents. =Professional career= The Washington Nationals selected Romero with 25th overall choice in the 2017 MLB Draft. He signed with the team on July 7, reportedly accepting an over-slot $2.8 million signing bonus. While the Nationals' scouting director said he believed Romero's \\"stuff\\" could immediately be effective in Major League Baseball, the team's general manager, Mike Rizzo, said he did not expect Romero to make his major league debut in the 2017 season. Romero was assigned to the GCL Nationals, and after one scoreless appearance, was promoted to the Auburn Doubledays where he posted a 5.40 ERA with 32 strikeouts in 20 innings to finish the season. Ranked as the fifth-best Nationals prospect before the 2018 season, Romero was placed on the Nationals' early camp roster for spring training that year. However, he was ordered to leave camp on March 5 for reportedly violating team policy. On June 6, he was reinstated and assigned to the Hagerstown Suns of the Class-A South Atlantic League. However, Romero made just seven starts and saw his season end early as he underwent Tommy John surgery at the end of August 2018. Romero did not play in the 2019 season.

He won the Florida Derby in his first graded stakes race appearance and then won the 2017 Kentucky Derby. He finished his career with a record of four wins from eleven starts, and earnings of $2,415,860. Background Always Dreaming is a dark bay colt who was bred in Kentucky by Santa Rosa Partners (Gerry Dilger and Mike Ryan). He is from the first crop of foals sired by Bodemeister, the runner-up in both the 2012 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The dam of Always Dreaming, Above Perfection, was an exceptional sprinter who won the Las Flores Handicap in 2002. Above Perfection's earlier foals include Grade I winner Hot Dixie Chick. Although both Bodemeister and Above Perfection were known for their speed, there are multiple stamina influences further back in the pedigree. Always Dreaming was sold at the Keeneland September 2015 Yearling Sale for $350,000. He was bought by Anthony Bonomo's Brooklyn Boyz Stables and his wife Mary Ellen's MeB Stables. \\"My son (Anthony Jr.) was doing the bidding. I was working. I gave him the budget and thank God he went over it,\\" said Bonomo. \\"I could tell you that two years ago, on the day we bought the horse, I was really upset. You flash forward two years and I can't kiss him enough. He has a keen eye.\\" In the summer of 2016, Bonomo and Vincent Viola, both long-time racing fans from Brooklyn, decided to join forces, a move that affected the ownership of Always Dreaming. Viola owns St. Elias Stable and his wife is the owner of Teresa Viola Racing Stable. \\"I'm a couple of years older (than Bonomo), but we played baseball together and, you know each other from the neighborhood,\\" said Viola before the 2017 Kentucky Derby. \\"When I got back into the Thoroughbreds, I called Anthony. We were doing the same thing separately, so we decided to do it together, and that's exactly what you see here.\\" In early 2017, the Bonomos and Violas sold a minority interest in Always Dreaming to West Point Thoroughbreds and Siena Farm. Originally trained by Dominick Schettino, Always Dreaming was transferred to the barn of Todd Pletcher in September 2016. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Always Dreaming raced twice at age two, finishing third in his debut on July 1, 2016 at Belmont Park and second in his next start at Saratoga on August 20. In September, Always Dreaming was transferred to the barn of Todd Pletcher, who decided the colt would benefit from some time off. When Always Dreaming returned to training, Pletcher could see an improvement. \\"We could see right away,\\" he said, \\"as soon as we were breezing him, that he had extra special talent.\\" =2017: three-year-old season= Always Dreaming made his three-year-old debut on January 25, 2017 at Tampa Bay Downs as the 1-5 favorite in a maiden special weight race. Pletcher chose the race from among several other maiden races being run on that date based on the distance of miles, feeling 7 furlongs was too short for the colt but miles would be too long after such a long layoff. Pletcher also felt lucky to secure the services of jockey John Velazquez, with whom he had a long-term association, for the ride. Always Dreaming raced just off the early pace then drew away from the field to win by lengths. His next start was on March 4 in an Allowance Optional Claiming race at Gulfstream Park over a distance of miles. Pletcher chose this race rather than the Fountain of Youth Stakes held on the same day as part of a plan to keep the colt from peaking too early in the Derby prep season. Starting at odds of 1-10, Always Dreaming set an \\"almost unbelievably slow pace\\", then pulled away to win by four lengths. The lightly raced colt then stepped up to face Grade I company in the Florida Derby on April 1 at Gulfstream. He was the second betting choice at nearly 3-1 behind Kentucky Derby hopeful Gunnevera. Always Dreaming vied for the early lead with Three Rules and State of Honor, then settled into second place down the backstretch. Rounding into the stretch, Always Dreaming kicked away from the rest of the field and won by 5 lengths. His time for the distance of miles was 1:47.47. Kentucky Derby The Florida Derby win made Always Dreaming one of the leading contenders for the 2017 Kentucky Derby. He shipped to Churchill Downs to train for the race, but attracted concern by his headstrong behavior in his morning workouts. Pletcher changed his exercise rider and added draw reins in an attempt to get the horse to settle. After the second workout with the new equipment, Always Dreaming learned to stop fighting his rider. \\"The horse is moving fantastic. We want to be able to control that energy and I think we've made big strides in doing that overnight,\\" said Pletcher. \\"I would much rather be in this position than to come in with a horse not feeling good or hanging his head.\\" The finish of the 2017 Kentucky Derby. The 2017 Kentucky Derby was held on May 6 at Churchill Downs over a track that was officially labelled as wet fast. After drawing post position five in a full field of 20 horses, Always Dreaming was made the 5-1 second choice on the morning line by track handicapper Mike Battaglia. When wagering opened, his odds shortened slightly to 9-2, making him the post-time favorite. Always Dreaming broke well and settled just behind the early leader State of Honor with good position on the rail. After half a mile, jockey John R. Velazquez moved him to the outside of State of Honor and the two raced together into the far turn. When other horses then started to challenge for the lead, Always Dreaming quickly responded by drawing away and opening a lead of several lengths in the stretch. Longshot Lookin At Lee made a late run to finish second, but Always Dreaming was never threatened, winning by lengths. His time was 2:03.59 for the distance of miles. After the race, Velazquez said, \\"I got a good position with him early and then he relaxed. When we hit the quarter pole, I asked him and he responded. He did it himself from there.\\"\\"Always Dreaming overcomes soggy track to win 143rd Kentucky Derby\\". espn.com. May 6, 2017. Retrieved May 6, 2017. Always Dreaming became the first horse in 84 years (since Brokers Tip in 1933) to win the Derby having not won a race as a two-year-old; it was late January at age three when he won his first race. Pletcher and Velazquez had worked together many times, and this was the first Kentucky Derby they won together. Velazquez said, \\"This is the best horse Todd and I have ever come to the Kentucky Derby with. Being behind me for 24 years together, a long time for him to still trust in me and give me the opportunity, it's not very often it happens in this business.\\" After the race, Mary Ellen Bonomo explained the horse's name. \\"I just always daydreamed,\\" she said. \\"And I said, 'Why don‚Äôt we just name it Dreaming?' Everybody dreams of something, whether it's a big event or special day, the birth of their child, winning the Kentucky Derby... When this horse has its first baby, we will name it Keep On Dreaming.\\" Remainder of 2017 season Always Dreaming came out of the Derby in good condition and made his next start in the 2017 Preakness Stakes on May 20, with hopes of winning the second jewel of the Triple Crown. In the Preakness, he led from the outset, challenged by Derby rival Classic Empire with Cloud Computing stalking the leading pair. On the final turn, Classic Empire moved to the front and appeared set up to win until Cloud Computing swung wide, brushing Always Dreaming, and in a stretch run, defeated Classic Empire by a head. Always Dreaming tired, ultimately finishing 8th. The connections of Always Dreaming elected to bypass the 2017 Belmont Stakes in June to give the colt time to recover for the remainder of the racing season. On July 29, he returned in the Jim Dandy Stakes, where he finished third after setting the early pace. On August 26, he finished ninth in the Travers Stakes after pressing the early pace set by the winner West Coast. Following the race, Always Dreaming was found to be suffering from stomach ulcers and was turned out at WinStar Farm to recuperate. =2018: four-year-old season= Always Dreaming made two starts in 2018, finishing second in the Gulfstream Park Hardacre Mile and fifth in the Alysheba Stakes at Churchill Downs. His retirement was announced by Elliott Walden on September 5, 2018. Always Dreaming will remain at WinStar Farm where he will stand the 2019 breeding season for a stud fee of $25,000.

It amended section 2(1), paragraph two, of the US Housing Act of 1937, and was enacted on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1969. The Brooke Amendment became the first instance of the benchmark to measure housing affordability, which became known as the \\"30 percent rule of thumb\\" in 1981 when the 25 percent cap was raised to 30 percent of tenant income. Senator Brooke advocated for two other subsections that were enacted in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1969. Section 213 (b) gives the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) authority to revoke the 25 percent cap if it results in a reduction of total welfare assistance. Section 213 (c) amends section 14 of the Housing Act of 1937 to ensure the \\"low-rent character of public housing projects\\" by fixing annual contract contributions according to the current Federal rate of interest.

Emu Creek is a suburb North East of Sedgwick.  History  The First Freehold land was granted in 1854. In 1863 The Great Eastern Mine was founded in Sedgwick. Many of the miners lived in the area around the mine so there was a hotel called the Great Eastern and a store. It was the only mine in the district. A Methodist chapel opened on the 9th of April 1873 and was in use until 1920. In 1877 a water channel running from Malmsbury to Bendigo was completed, running through the southern and western sides of Sedgwick it still exists today. In a public meeting in 1942, it was proposed that a bush fire brigade should be formed. The last big bush fire to burn through Sedgwick was in 1944 and burnt from Ravenswood to near Kyneton however they still have fought many smaller fires in Sedgwick and numerous larger fires in places like Mt Macedon and Maryborough. http://sedgwickcommunity.org.au/portfolio/history/sedgwick-fire- brigade-history/ References External links * http://sedgwickcommunity.org.au/ Category:Towns in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Sedgwick, Victoria"},{"id":"53954634","text":"Chanter v Blackwood and the related case of Maloney v McEacharn were a series of decisions of the High Court of Australia, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns arising from the 1903 federal election for the seats of Riverina and Melbourne in the House of Representatives. Chanter v Blackwood (No 1),. and Maloney v McEacharn (No 1),. determined questions of law as to the validity of certain votes. In Chanter v Blackwood (No 2) Griffith CJ held that 91 votes were invalid and because this exceeded the majority, the election was void, while Chanter v Blackwood (No 3) dealt with questions of costs. In Maloney v McEacharn (No 2) more than 300 votes were found to be invalid and the parties agreed it was appropriate for the election to be declared void.Maloney v McEacharn No 2 (1904) 10 Argus LR (CN) 17. Background Section 47 of the Constitution provides that disputed elections were to be determined by the relevant House of Parliament, \\"until the Parliament otherwise provides\\". Disputed elections. Thus the challenges to the 1901 election for the House of Representatives were considered by the Committee of Elections and Qualifications and determined by a vote of the House. In 1902 the Parliament enacted the Commonwealth Electoral Act which established the High Court as the Court of Disputed Returns. The first elections were conducted under the laws of the former colonies. The 1903 election however was conducted under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and the related Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902 which gave Australian women the right to vote at a national level, and to stand for election to the Parliament. The process was that each elector was allocated to a particular polling place in the division and in the ordinary course would vote at that polling place by placing a cross opposite the name of the candidate they wished to vote for and their name would be marked off the roll. If the elector attended another polling place, they had to make a declaration and the vote was sent to the designated polling place for that elector. The system was thereby designed as a check to prevent a person from voting more than once in the election. An elector could in limited circumstances apply for a postal vote. What happened in these cases was that electors attending another polling place were not given ordinary ballot papers, but instead were given a blank ballot paper to write down the name of the candidate they wished to vote for. =Riverina= John Chanter was a Protectionist,There was no national Protectionist party organisation at the time of the 1901 election. Members categorised as \\"Protectionist\\" were those who accepted the leadership of Edmund Barton. who supported the first Prime Minister, Edmund Barton, and had won the seat of Riverina at the 1901 election. At the 1903 election there was one other candidate, Robert Blackwood, representing the Free Trade Party. Blackwood won the election with a majority of just 5 votes. Chanter challenged the election result on the grounds that included: * Ballot papers had been improperly rejected because the cross was not within the square on the ballot paper; * Absentee ballots had been improperly received because they only contained the name of one candidate; * Blackwood had engaged in illegal practices in supplying meat, drink and entertainment to influence the votes of electors and dismissing his cook for supporting Chanter. =Melbourne= Sir Malcolm McEacharn was also a Protectionist and had won the seat of Melbourne at the 1901 election, comfortably defeating the Labour Party candidate William Maloney. At the 1903 election McEacharn again defeated Maloney, but with a much reduced majority of 77 votes. Maloney challenged the election result on the grounds that included: * Postal votes had been improperly received because they were not signed in the presence of a Returning Officer or other specified person; and * Absentee ballots had been improperly received because they only contained the name of one candidate. One of the curious circumstances of this seat was that it was a contest between the Protectionist and Labour parties where the Protectionist Deakin Government held office with the support of Labour. Chanter v Blackwood Chanter v Blackwood (No 1) concerned legal questions that Griffith CJ, as the trial judge, had referred to the full court to be answered as a stated case. =Formality of ballot papers= Griffith CJ held that the provision of section 133 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, was not mandatory and it was sufficient if the ballot paper substantially complied, noting that the consequences of a ballot being informal would be to deprive the elector of his vote. Barton J similarly emphasised the desirability of not disenfranchising voters for the slightest slip, provided the intention of the voter was clearly expressed. O'Connor J dissented, holding that it was mandatory for the cross to be placed within the square. The judges were unanimous in holding that striking out the name of a candidate not voted for did not make the ballot informal. =Absentee voters= The court was unanimous in holding that the Commonwealth Electoral Act required the ballots to have the name of each candidate and that the blank ballots with just one name written on them were invalid. The reasons for this conclusion were more fully set out in the judgment of Griffith CJ in Maloney v McEacharn. =Illegal practices= The question considered by the Court was whether a candidate guilty of an illegal practice as defined in the Commonwealth Electoral Act was disqualified from being elected. Griffith CJ held that Parliament had prescribed the remedies for illegal practices and that did not include automatic disqualification from sitting. Barton J held that a single act of bribery did not disqualify a candidate, unless the corrupt practices might have affected the result of the election. O'Connor J held that there was no power under the Commonwealth Electoral Act to disqualify a candidate on the ground of misconduct, no matter how great. Both Griffith CJ and O'Connor J expressed the view, obiter dicta, that conviction for an offence punishable by imprisonment for one year was sufficient to disqualify a person from sitting under Section 44 of the Constitution even if the person was not ultimately sentenced to imprisonment. =Chanter v Blackwood No 2 and No 3= Having answered the separate legal questions, Griffiths CJ then conducted a trial in which he ruled on each of the disputed categories of votes. The result of this recount was that Chanter should have been elected by a majority of 67 votes. His Honour held however that 91 people had voted who had no right to do so. It was impossible to trace the improper votes and they outnumbered Chanter's majority on the recount, thus the improper votes might have affected the result of the election. Accordingly Griffith CJ held that the election was void and there should be a by-election for the seat. The matter returned yet again to the Court on 16 August 1904 where Griffith CJ held that Chanter should be reimbursed his costs of travelling to Melbourne for the hearing, even though he was not required to give evidence. Maloney v McEacharn Maloney v McEacharn (No 1) also concerned legal questions that Griffith CJ, as the trial judge, had referred to the full court to be answered as a stated case. =Postal votes= A large number of postal votes had not been not signed in the presence of a Returning Officer, Electoral Registrar, Justice of the Peace, School Teacher, or a Postmaster. Griffith CJ held that an elector was generally required to vote at the polling place for which he was enrolled. The privilege of voting elsewhere was subject to compliance with conditions that were intended to prevent fraudulent votes. The attestation of postal votes was a safeguard against fraud. Barton J expressed his reluctance in concluding that electors were disenfranchised despite doing their best to comply with the Act. Postal votes stretched the secrecy of the ballot and had the potential for fraud, thus requiring vigilance and the safeguards provided for by the Act. O'Connor J similarly held that postal votes gave the greatest opportunity for fraud, being probably made \\"amongst people who cannot identify him and who know nothing about the form in which his name appears on the electoral roll\\" in which the legislature had been careful to enact safeguards. =Absentee votes= Griffith CJ noted that the regulations required the ballot-papers to be in the ordinary form however the names of the candidates may be written instead of printed and that the elector was required to make a cross opposite the name of the candidate voted for. Because the names of all candidates did not appear on the ballot paper the elector could not comply with the condition and the votes must therefore be rejected. Barton and O'Connor JJ agreed with Griffith CJ. =Maloney v McEacharn No 2= The votes found to be invalid were 300 of the 600 postal votes and all of the 66 absentee votes. There was some debate as to the cause of the errors in the postal votes, during which Griffith CJ expressed a tentative view that if a vote was invalid because of an elector's error then that was misfortune, for the elector and the candidate, however errors by an official were matters that may make the election void. In the end both candidates agreed that in light of the large number of errors it was appropriate for the election to be declared void and for there to be by-election for the seat. Aftermath A by-election for the seat of Melbourne was held on 30 March 1904 where Maloney comfortably defeated McEacharn with a majority of 859 votes. A by-election for the seat of Riverina was held on 30 March 1904 where Chanter defeated Blackwood with a majority of 393 votes. Blackwood is said to have later been cleared of all allegations. Chanter would later disparage the delay and costs of disputing elections in the High Court, while both Chanter and Maloney pressed for greater scrutiny of the election expenses incurred by candidates. The outcome of the High Court's emphasis on the extent to which errors or illegal practice may have affected the outcome of the election,. is that only close contests give rise to petitions. Further the costs involved mean that serious challenges to the election results are run only by the major parties. (2001) 23 Sydney Law Review 53.

The probability of observing choice \\\\mathbf{y_i} is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{y_i}\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) = & \\\\int_{A_J}\\\\cdots\\\\int_{A_1}f_N(\\\\mathbf{y}^*_i\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) dy^*_1\\\\dots dy^*_J \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{y_i}\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) = & \\\\int \\\\mathbb{1}_{y^* \\\\in A} f_N(\\\\mathbf{y}^*_i\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) d\\\\mathbf{y}^*_i \\\\end{align} Where A = A_1 \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times A_J and, : A_j = \\\\begin{cases} (-\\\\infty,0] & y_j = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ (0, \\\\infty) & y_j = 1 \\\\end{cases} Unless J is small (less than or equal to 2) there is no closed form solution for the integrals defined above (some work has been done with J = 3 ). The alternative to evaluating these integrals closed form or by quadrature methods is to use simulation. GHK is a simulation method to simulate the probability above using importance sampling methods. Evaluating \\\\Pr(\\\\mathbf{y_i}\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) = \\\\int \\\\mathbb{1}_{y^* \\\\in A} f_N(\\\\mathbf{y}^*_i\\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) d\\\\mathbf{y}^*_i is simplified by recognizing that the latent data model \\\\mathbf{y_i^*} = \\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta} + \\\\epsilon can be rewritten using a Cholesky factorization, \\\\Sigma = CC' . This gives \\\\mathbf{y_i^*} = \\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta} + C\\\\eta_i where the \\\\eta_i terms are distributed N(0,\\\\mathbf{I}) . Using this factorization and the fact that the \\\\eta_i are distributed independently one can simulate draws from a truncated multivariate normal distribution using draws from a univariate random normal. For example, if the region of truncation \\\\mathbf{A} has lower and upper limits equal to [a,b] (including a,b = \\\\pm\\\\infty ) then the task becomes : \\\\begin{array}{lcl} a < & y^*_1 & < b \\\\\\\\\\\\ a < & y^*_2 & < b \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a < & y^*_J & < b \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} Note: \\\\mathbf{y_i^*} = \\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta} + C\\\\eta_i , substituting: : \\\\begin{array}{lcl} a < & x_1\\\\beta_1 + c_{11}\\\\eta_1 & < b \\\\\\\\\\\\ a < & x_2\\\\beta_2 + c_{21}\\\\eta_1 + c_{22}\\\\eta_2 & < b \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a < & x_J\\\\beta_J + \\\\sum_{k=1}^J c_{J,k}\\\\eta_k & < b \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} Rearranging above, : \\\\begin{array}{ccc} \\\\frac{a - x_1\\\\beta_1}{c_{11}} & < \\\\eta_1 < & \\\\frac{b - x_1\\\\beta_1}{c_{11}}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{a - (x_2\\\\beta_2 + c_{21}\\\\eta_1)}{c_{22}} & < \\\\eta_2 < & \\\\frac{b - (x_2\\\\beta_2 + c_{21}\\\\eta_1)}{c_{22}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{a - (x_J\\\\beta_J + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{J-1} c_{J,k})}{c_{J,J}} & < \\\\eta_k < & \\\\frac{b - (x_J\\\\beta_J + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{J-1} c_{J,k})}{c_{J,J}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} Now all one needs to do is iteratively draw from the truncated univariate normal distribution with the given bounds above. This can be done by the inverse CDF method and noting the truncated normal distribution is given by, : u = \\\\frac{ \\\\Phi( \\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}) - \\\\Phi(\\\\frac{a-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}) }{ \\\\Phi(\\\\frac{b-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}) - \\\\Phi(\\\\frac{a-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma})} Where u will be a number between 0 and 1 because the above is a CDF. This suggests to generate random draws from the truncated distribution one has to solve for x giving, : x = \\\\sigma F^{-1}(u*(F(\\\\beta) - F(\\\\alpha)) + F(\\\\alpha)) + \\\\mu where \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{a-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} and \\\\beta = \\\\frac{b-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} and F is the standard normal CDF. With such draws one can reconstruct the \\\\mathbf{y^*_i} by its simplified equation using the Cholesky factorization. These draws will be conditional on the draws coming before and using properties of normals the product of the conditional PDFs will be the joint distribution of the \\\\mathbf{y^*_i} , : q(\\\\mathbf{y^*_i}\\\\mathbf{X_1\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) = q(y^*_1\\\\mathbf{X_1\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma)q(y^*_2y^*_1, \\\\mathbf{X_1\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma)\\\\dots q(y^*_Jy^*_1,\\\\dots,y^*_{J-1},\\\\mathbf{X_1\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) Where q(\\\\cdot) is the multivariate normal distribution. Because y^*_j conditional on y_k, \\\\ k is restricted to the set A by the setup using the Cholesky factorization then we know that q(\\\\cdot) is a truncated multivariate normal. The distribution function of a truncated normal is, : \\\\frac{ \\\\phi(\\\\frac{x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma })} {\\\\sigma(\\\\Phi(\\\\frac{b-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}) - \\\\Phi(\\\\frac{a-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma})) } Therefore, y^*_j has distribution, : \\\\begin{align} q(\\\\mathbf{y^*_i}  \\\\mathbf{X_i\\\\beta}, \\\\Sigma) & = \\\\frac{ \\\\frac{1}{c_{11}} \\\\phi_1\\\\Big( \\\\frac{y^*_{j} - x_1\\\\beta }{c_{11}}\\\\Big)}{\\\\Big( \\\\Phi_1\\\\Big( \\\\frac{b- x_1\\\\beta}{c_{11}} \\\\Big) -\\\\Phi_1\\\\Big( \\\\frac{a- x_1\\\\beta}{c_{11}} \\\\Big) \\\\Big)}\\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{c_{JJ}}\\\\phi_J\\\\Big(\\\\frac{y^*_J - (x_J\\\\beta + c_{J1}\\\\eta_1 + c_{J2}\\\\eta_2 + \\\\dots + c_{JJ-1} \\\\eta_{J-1})}{c_{JJ}}\\\\Big) }{\\\\Big(\\\\Phi_J \\\\Big( \\\\frac{b- (x_J\\\\beta + c_{J1}\\\\eta_1 + c_{J2}\\\\eta_2 + \\\\dots + c_{JJ-1} \\\\eta_{J-1})}{c_{JJ}} \\\\Big) - \\\\Phi_J \\\\Big( \\\\frac{a- (x_J\\\\beta + c_{J1}\\\\eta_1 + c_{J2}\\\\eta_2 + \\\\dots + c_{JJ-1} \\\\eta_{J-1}}{c_{JJ}}\\\\Big) \\\\Big)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_{j=1}^{J} \\\\frac{1}{c_{jj}} \\\\phi_j\\\\Big( \\\\frac{y^*_j - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{k where \\\\phi_j is the standard normal pdf for choice j .

Expansion of Marine National Monuments and National Marine Sanctuaries  One of the main goals of the four-fold expansion of the PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument was to promote the conservation of marine biodiversity in the U.S. EEZ. Scientific studies have shown that underwater mountains, or seamounts, are rich in biodiversity as they provide a structure for animals to live on. Free-floating larvae lost on ocean currents are able to settle on seamounts from many distant areas. Seamounts cause comparatively strong currents that bring in phytoplankton and other nutrients and attract pelagic species. Sedentary animals like sponges, corals, and gorgonians propagate on the available space the seamount provides; they also benefit from incoming nutrients from the currents. These sedentary animals provide a structure and the basis of a thriving ecosystem. The original boundaries of PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument, set in 2006 at 50 nautical miles around the coral atolls and reefs, did not include many seamounts, which the revised boundaries now do. The goal of the expansion was to protect these biodiversity hot spots from potential adverse effects of fishing, allowing them to function as fish refugia, places where fish populations can grow and maintain a natural age structure, especially the pelagic tuna and sharks. President Obama's proclamation effectuating this geographic expansion in 2016 also expanded the management philosophy of the Monument. The proclamation added the Office of Hawaiian Affairs as a full partner in the cooperative management agreement in recognition of the significance of the islands and coral reefs to living Native Hawaiian culture. Archaeological sites and ancestral environments are located on the islands of Nihoa and Mokumanamana. PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as a mixed natural and cultural site in July 2010. This inscription adds a layer of international protection to the Monument. Another monument President Obama expanded for biodiversity preservation is the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, surrounding Wake, Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands, Johnston and Palmyra Atolls, and Kingman Reef.https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2014-09-29/pdf/2014-23319.pdf These marine areas are part of the Exclusive Economic Zone that was codified by the Magnuson‚ÄìStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Obama administration in 2012 expanded administratively the boundaries of the Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary from less than one square mile to 13,581 square miles. It also reestablished the sanctuary nomination process under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. Regulations calling for public nominations were published in the Federal Register in June, 2014. NOAA, however, rejected a nomination to establish the Aleutian Islands National Marine Sanctuary based on a lack of support from the communities that would be most affected by the designation. On 26 April 2017 President Trump signed Executive Order 13792, which directed the Secretary of the Interior to review certain National Monuments designated or expanded under the Antiquities Act. Section 2 of the Executive Order specifies that not all National Monuments are under review, only those that \\"were created after 1 January 1996, where the designation covers more than 100,000 acres, where the designation after expansion covers more than 100,000 acres, or where the Secretary determines that the designation or expansion was made without adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders, to determine whether each designation or expansion conforms to the policy set forth in section 1 of the order.\\" The Marine National Monuments being considered under this Executive Order include but are not limited to: the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, and the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument. Unlike Marine Sanctuary designation, Marine National Monument designation does not require a public comment period because National Monuments are established by means of the Antiquities Act and Marine Sanctuaries are created by an act of NOAA and Congress. Through this review process Trump and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke hope[d] to \\"gain local input [which] is a critical component of federal land management.\\" As of 19 December 2019 Zinke is no longer the Secretary of the Interior and the only National Monuments that have shrunk in size were terrestrial ones located in Utah, namely Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante. In his report, Zinke advised Trump to allow commercial fishing within the Rose Atoll, Pacific Remote Islands, and Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monuments. On June 6, 2020, U.S. president Donald Trump issued a proclamation reopening the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts to commercial fishing, arguing that the fish species protected by the monument (tuna, sharks, etc.) are not unique and are well-managed for sustainability under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. On the previous day, at a roundtable discussion of commercial fishing issues in Bangor, Maine, the president said that the Obama proclamation creating the Monument, which had made a seven-year exception to the no-fishing rule for the lobster and red crab industries, \\"was deeply unfair to Maine lobstermen,\\" according to the Associated Press. According to the White House transcript of the roundtable, however, Maine lobstermen, who do not fish in waters as far south as the Monument, commented that the tariffs imposed by China on their lobster shipments, in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, had reduced their exports to zero. President Trump directed his trade advisor to look into the complaint. Policy Decisions under Federal Marine Conservation Laws  Hawaiian Monk Seal at French Frigate Shoals hauled-out for rest. Beyond his expansion of the PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument, there were also other actions throughout the Obama administration which afforded more explicit protections for marine life. These included decisions under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. The Hawaiian monk seal (HMS) is an endangered species which resides in both the Main Hawaiian Islands and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). This species is not only an endangered species, but also enjoys the protections provided by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Effective September 21, 2015, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), a division of NOAA, issued a final rule to revise the critical habitat designation for the HMS. The changes made clarified the location and refined the boundaries of pupping, nursing, and haul-out areas. Essential foraging areas were updated to be \\"marine areas 0-200 meters in depth that support adequate prey availability and quantity for juvenile and adult monk seal foraging.\\" In the NWHI, all terrestrial areas, except for Midway harbor and non-accessible and unused areas, are considered \\"critical habitat\\". Other significant domestic marine policy actions carried over from previous administrations. Notable examples include the decision on reinstating Indian whaling by the Makah Tribe of western Washington state,Traditional Makah practices surrounding whaling applying a strict U.S. definition of \\"dolphin-safe\\" for canned tuna imports, denial of a permit to import beluga whales from Russia for public display and captive breeding by several prominent sea life parks and aquarium, rejecting a petition to list the Reef Manta Ray as a threatened distinct population segment, and adoption of regulations governing the import of fish and fish products from countries that do not effectively control by-catch of marine mammals in commercial fisheries that export their catches to the U.S., especially small, endemic populations such as the Vaquita porpoise in the Gulf of California and the Hector's dolphin in New Zealand. The Obama administration also dealt with recurrent, politically-sensitive decisions including approving incidental \\"take\\" permits for noise harassment by military training and readiness exercises using active sonar and by-catch reduction regulations for US commercial fisheries that interact with endangered sea turtles, seabirds or cetaceans or that occur within designated critical habitat of endangered marine mammals. After designating critical habitat for threatened polar bear populations listed by the Bush administration, the Obama administration considered listing petitions for additional marine life species threatened by climate change, including ice-dependent seals in the U.S. Arctic, and reef-building corals. During the Obama years, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Deep Sea Coral Research and Technology Program made significant investments in research on deep-water corals.https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/coris/library/NOAA/DSCRTP/Other/Reports_To_Congress/2018/DSCRTP2018_Report_to_Congress.pdf.

General Assembly supported resolutions calling for the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) from the adverse effects of high seas fisheries.  Offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic Ocean  High-profile events during the Obama presidency focused attention on the safety of deepwater oil drilling in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the U.S. The April 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico occurred shortly after the Interior Department released a five-year plan for oil and gas development of the U.S. outer continental shelf (OCS). President Obama appointed a bipartisan committee to determine the causes of the blowout and to recommend policies to prevent future disasters. In 2015, hundreds of kayakers, led by a canoer from the Lummi Nation, protested plans to drill for oil and gas in the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea. They surrounded a drilling rig in waters off Seattle, Washington and prevented its departure. In December, 2016, under the authority of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, a new Arctic policy of Barack Obama included actions to remove almost all U.S. Arctic waters (as well as large portions of the NW Atlantic continental shelf) from the offshore oil program. Ten days after the 2016 presidential election, the Interior Department released its 2017-2022 plan for offshore oil and gas leasing. President Trump issued an appeal to repeal President Obamas ban on offshore drilling in the 120 million acres of the Arctic Ocean on April 28, 2017. Part of this was to reinsert the Arctic in the five-year plan for offshore drilling and revoking the protection of the Arctic Ocean as set fourth by President Obama. Judge Sharon L. Gleason of the United States District Court for the District of Alaska ruled that President Barack Obama's 2015 and 2016 protection on the Arctic Ocean and portions of the Atlantic would remain in full affect until revoked by Congress. She ruled that President Trump's withdraw of the protection was unlawful and exceeded the authority of the President.  Global shark fin trade  Every year, an estimated 100 million sharks are killed globally. Sharks are an apex predator in the ocean, where they play a large role in maintaining balance in the ecosystem. Sharks are also especially susceptible to over fishing because of their low reproductive rates.Morgan, A., Burgess, G., & Morgan, A. (2007). At- vessel fishing mortality for six species of sharks caught in the northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Gulf and Caribbean Research, 19(2), 123‚Äì129. https://doi.org/10.18785/gcr.1902.15 The global shark fin trade contributes largely to the overfishing of sharks. To combat the unsustainable global shark fin trade, President Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act of 2009. This act replaced the pre-existing Shark Finning Prohibition Act, implemented in 2000 under the Clinton Administration.http://www.scpr.org/news/2013/08/15/38716/obama-administration- supports-shark-fin-ban-oppone/ Retrieved 2017-05-03.

Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins, 353 F. Supp. 2d 1095 In response, the Shark Conservation Act of 2009 prohibited the landing, possession or transfer of fins not attached to the carcass between vessels. In response to declining shark populations as a result of shark finning, the State of California enacted a Shark Fin Law, AB 376, in 2011 which banned the possession and sale of shark fins, making it illegal to sell or serve shark fin soup.http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Appeals-courts-considers-shark-fin- ban-4733419.php.

In 2013, the U.S. Justice Department sparked controversy regarding the State of California's 2011 law when it filed an amicus brief in a lawsuit challenging the Shark Fin Law. In upholding the California law, the U.S. court of appeals did not agree that the state shark fin ban interfered with the purposes of the federal Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, under which a small commercial shark fishery is authorized in the NW Atlantic.Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, as amended through January 2007, Public Law 94-265, 94th Cong., 2d sess.

In addition, the NOAA assistant administrator for fisheries later determined that state and territorial laws banning possession and trade in shark fins are consistent with, and not subject to federal preemption by, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which is designed to prevent overfishing and ensure a sustainable seafood supply.http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/stories/2014/02/docs/california.pdf.

The language of the act specifies that it applies to vessels at sea, and does not directly ban the possession of shark fins still attached to the shark carcass on land. Under this act, fisherman are required to wait until they returned to land to de-fin the shark. This forced consumers to look to international markets for shark fins and allowed US fishermen to continue shark finning as long as they were on land. On January 23, 2019, Representatives Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan and Tulsi Gabbard introduced the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act of 2019 to the House of Representatives. After being passed and agreed to in the house, the bill has now been introduced to the Senate by Senator Cory Booker. This bill would correct the loophole exploited in the Shark Conservation Act by making it illegal to transport, possess, sell, offer for sale, or purchase shark fins or products containing shark fins. The Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act of 2019 is intended to eliminate the international market for shark fins into the US. There are a few exceptions to this bill; if shark fins are destroyed or discarded upon the separation of its carcass then that is a lawful practice, if the fins are used for noncommercial purposes as long as that practice is in accordance with state and federal laws, if fins are used for display at museums, universities, or under a person with a permit whose intentions are for research purposes, or if a person is to obtain a permit for noncommercial use. The penalty for this violation is a $100,000 fine or the market value of the fins, whichever is higher.  Shipping and marine protected species  Major policy decisions enhancing the protection of marine mammals and endangered sea turtles in U.S. waters included the removal of sunset provision for vessel restrictions to reduce ship collisions with North Atlantic right whales and the listing of distinct population segments of threatened and endangered sea turtles. Loggerhead sea turtle policies of the Barack Obama Administration (2009-2017) included tightening of regulations to prevent by-catch or incidental takes in commercial fisheries due to mass fishing techniques like Long-line fishing. The speed restrictions were adopted previously under the U.S. Endangered Species Act to reduce death and injury by ship collision with endangered whales. This action made the restrictions permanent.\\"Endangered Fish and Wildlife; Proposed Rule To Eliminate the Expiration Date Contained in the Final Rule To Reduce the Threat of Ship Collisions With North Atlantic Right Whales\\".

It calls upon states and federal agencies to develop integrated plans for protecting and restoring the resilience of fresh, marine and estuarine water resources, using the best science available to develop policy interventions for sustainability and productiveness, respecting social cultural, recreational and historical values, promoting public awareness, and bringing federal, state and non- governmental agencies together for action, all in a fiscally responsible manner. Coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP) is a comprehensive system of science-based and adaptive strategies to identify, facilitate and design the changes needs to reduce conflict and preserve marine ecosystems. Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a process which is a respected part. Approaches differ among locations as well as implementation. Cost and benefits can delay the process. Most plans have several key components in common: a legal order with political capabilities, specifying plan with acute details, the properties supporting the plan should match fiscal and human resources, and revisions should be allowed with input from stakeholders and leniency for modifications. Other countries have adopted CMSP but in the United States, notably Massachusetts, Florida and Oregon. From June 2009, President Obama was developing an interagency task force to address public comment and outline policies. Unites States coastal areas were divided into 9 areas, each with a program to address local issues. Another goal was to map out biologically and ecologically important areas surrounding the United States that are necessary for science. On June 19, 2018, President Donald Trump signed the executive order 13840, Ocean Policy to Advance the Economic, Security, and Environmental Interests of the United States. Its focus was the utilization of the nation's natural water resources in terms of economy, security and global competitiveness with public and federal support and to enhance benefits to both. Its policies include management of natural water resources for economic, security and environmental benefits, enforcement by United States Armed Forces and their right to exercise rights and jurisdiction with national and international law, American employment, use of American goods and enhance America's energy security, ensure policies do not prevent productive and sustainable use of natural resources, while maintaining consultation with state, federal, private, non-governmental agencies and foreign stakeholders. As part of the Obama Administration's effort to combat global climate change (and climate change denial), the Department of Interior held an auction of wind energy leases off the State of New York in December, 2016.https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-auction- over-79000-acres-offshore-new-york-wind-energy-development. Retrieved 2017-05-04. In April, 2016, President Obama and President Xi of China announced jointly that they were formally ratifying the Paris climate agreement, the first global agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/01/obama-climate- change-hawaii-nevada. Retrieved 2017-05-05. Additionally a development in offshore wind energy occurred during the Obama Administration and continued with President Trump support. In 2015 BOEM leased multiple plots of federal waters off the shores of many coastal states for commercial wind energy development. Currently projects in Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are proving beneficial while efforts in South Carolina, California and Hawai ªi are projected areas of new development.  International Law of the Sea  In addition to its essential role in shepherding the Paris Agreement on combatting climate change, the Obama administration was active in promoting decisions by the U.S. Congress and, through diplomatic negotiations, at U.N. agencies, the U.N. General Assembly, and other bodies that by international treaty have responsibilities for governing uses of the marine environment. These include the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Commission for the Conservation of Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Promotion of UNCLOS accession At a series of hearings before the [Senate Foreign Relations Committee] in May 2012, prominent members of President Obama's administration, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, testified in favor of U.S. ratification of UNCLOS. The U.S. is the only major industrialized nation not to be a party to this global agreement which provides the basis for world public order of the oceans. In 1994, UNCLOS was effectively amended by an U.N. agreement on the implementation of Part XI, the provisions setting forth the regulatory regime for [deep seabed mining]. This agreement, whose negotiations were led by the U.N. Secretary General, removed President Reagan's grounds for voting against UNCLOS when it was opened for signature in 1982. With respect to implementation of the [high seas] provisions of UNCLOS, in June 2015, the U.S. delegation to the U.N. joined the unanimous vote in favor of a [General Assembly resolution] calling for negotiations of an international treaty to provide protection of [marine biodiversity] in [areas beyond national jurisdiction] of any nation, including the [high seas]. Seabed Mining During the Obama Administration, an attempt in 2012 to ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty was put forward to the US Senate by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A successful ratification would change the process in which seabed mining licenses are issued for mining sites outside the US Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). Under the treaty, license applications would be sent to the International Seabed Authority (ISA) for evaluation opposed to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as it was under the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act of 1980. However, the ratification was unable to successfully pass in the senate as Republican senators banded together to gain majority vote. In 2012, a subsidiary of the Lockheed Martin Corporation requested an extension of their exploratory licenses from NOAA for two areas of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a stretch of Pacific seafloor rich in polymetallic nodules, so that it may be further investigated for potential deep seabed mining sites, which was then approved by NOAA. However, in May 2015, a lawsuit was filed against NOAA and US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) for approving the extensions. The CBD claimed that NOAA failed to comply with federal laws regarding license extension by approving the extension request without having acquired the Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from Lockheed Martin necessary to legally approve the extension. The court ruled in favor of the CBD, immediately nullifying the licenses extensions.Center of Biological Diversity v. Penny Pritzker & National Oceanic and Atmospheric Associaton. (2015)https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/deep- sea_mining/pdfs/Deep-seabedMiningComplaint_05-12-2015.pdf In 2017, Lockheed Martin would once again request for a license extension for the same two sections of the zone, with NOAA again approving them, but having received the necessary EIS. In September 2014, President Obama expanded the Pacific Remote Islands Monument, initially created by President George W. Bush, via the Antiquities Act of 1906. By doing this, the area for prospective seabed mining exploration in the Pacific Ocean was significantly reduced due to the new protections. Obama would repeat this process on a larger scale two years later with both the creation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, and the expansion of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, further decreasing the possible mining areas in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Following the election of Donald J. Trump as president in 2017, attempts were made to rollback these protections by presidential action, while New England and Mid-Atlantic fishermen challenged Obama's use of the Antiquities Act to create the Atlantic marine national monument off Massachusetts. The federal courts, however, rejected the fishermen's argument that since the U.S. EEZ is subject only to sovereign rights and not national ownership under international law the Antiquities Act cannot be used to protect marine ecosystems from extractive activity. In March 2018, research was published that concluded that deep seabed mining cannot be attained without significant net biodiversity loss, even with the strictest of measurements being in place. Eight months later, the Trump Administration released an ocean science and technology report summarizing the goals for ocean research over the next decade, including goals for deep seabed mining research.Science And Technology For America‚Äôs Oceans: A Decadal Vision (2018) https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Science-and-Technology- for-Americas-Oceans-A-Decadal-Vision.pdf A year later, the Trump administration released a fact sheet and an presidential memorandum placing a focus on ocean exploration and seafloor mapping of the EEZ off the Alaskan coasts in order to examine the bathymetry for resources within the EEZ, including critical minerals for future potential seabed mining operations. Freedom of Navigation in the South China Sea In marine-related foreign relations, President Obama authorized additional operations, known as FONOPs, under the U.S. Navy's [Freedom of Navigation Program]. The U.S. Navy carries out FONOPs in maritime spaces that are subject to claims of jurisdiction or sovereign rights by coastal States which the U.S. believes are excessive and infringe upon the freedom of navigation and overflight. These excessive claims have often been based on the application of [straight baselines] that depart appreciably from the general direction of the claiming nation's coastline or that do not enclose locally-used waters along a deeply indented or island- studded coastline. FONOPs during the Obama Administration focused on the semi- enclosed [South China Sea] and China's broad but ambiguous maritime claims asserted through a series of nine, dashed lines. In the decades-long [Spratly Islands dispute], the U.S. has avoided taking a position on the [territorial disputes in the South China Sea]. Following China's 2009 submission of a note verbale to the [U.N. Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf] opposing the joint submission of extended continental shelf claims filed by Malaysia and Vietnam and claiming \\"indisputable sovereignty\\" based upon historic rights within a [Nine-dashed line], the U.S. State Department published an analysis of this assertion in its [Limits in the Sea] series. The report concluded that China's claims were contrary to established principles of international law. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration released the long-awaited decision of the special arbitral tribunal established under UNCLOS's Annex VII upon the application of the Philippines. This case, [Philippines v. China], revolved around the actions by China to interfere with fishing activities in its EEZ in the area of submerged reefs and coral atolls that China built up into military bases through extensive land reclamation activities. The U.S. was not a party to the [South China Sea Arbitration], but the dispute concerned Chinese claims the U.S. has opposed through FONOPs by warships and overflight and through diplomatic protests. The Arbitral Tribunal found that the maritime features that China had reclaimed were not naturally formed islands entitled to an EEZ and continental shelf but had been \\"rocks\\" as that term is used in UNCLOS Article 121, paragraph 3, known as the [regime of islands]. In a much discussed decision, the tribunal concluded that there was no evidence that any of the features had supported a stable human community \\"without external additions.\\" Global Moratorium on Commercial Whaling The Obama administration continued the diplomatic project of the George W. Bush administration to seek a compromise on the issue of commercial whaling and Japan's whaling in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary adopted by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The goal was to keep Japan from renouncing the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) it had been a party to for many decades. Japan's efforts at the meetings of the IWC had failed, sometimes only narrowly, to remove the zero quotas from the ICRW's Schedule and to apply revised management procedures adopted by the IWC to set sustainable use quotas for Antarctic minke whale populations. US proposals for a compromise, for a 'future role of the IWC' in cetacean conservation, were debated at IWC meetings in 2010 and 2012. Following the 2014 decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case of Whaling in the Antarctic, Australia v. Japan: New Zealand Intervening [Japan whaling case] that Japan's program of granting special permits for lethal research, known as JARPA II, pursuant to article VIII of the ICRW, was not whaling for purposes of scientific research, the U.S. opposed efforts by Japan at the sixty-fifth meeting of the IWC in 2014 to limit the implications of the ICJ decision on the consideration of future research programs conducted by Japan. Late in 2018, Japan announced its withdrawal from the IWC and plan to recommence commercial whaling in Japan's EEZ and territorial waters, raising questions regarding the implications of [UNCLOS Article 65] on whaling in the EEZ, which states that \\"Nothing in this Part [on the EEZ regime] restricts the right of a coastal State or the competence of an international organization, as appropriate, to prohibit, limit or regulate the exploitation of marine mammals more strictly than provided for in this Part. States shall cooperate with a view to the conservation of marine mammals and in the case of cetaceans shall in particular work through appropriate international organizations for their conservation, management and study.\\" In Article 62, the duty of the coastal State is to \\"promote optimum utilization of the living resources in the EEZ without prejudice to article 61.\\" That article requires, inter alia, that the coastal State shall ensure, using the best scientific evidence available to it, that living resources are not endangered by over- exploitation, and cooperates with the appropriate international organizations to that end. It is not known if members of the U.S. Congress considered resolutions in 2019 and 2020 calling on the then-present administration to invoke provisions of the Pelly Amendment. This U.S. law allows the levying of trade sanctions in the form of import bans against nations that undermine international conservation agreements. In the past, violations of agreements that have triggered certification and possible trade sanctions have included violations of the ICRW, which establishes the IWC and its schedule of quotas and regulations, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which bans trade between parties in whale meat or other products. During the Obama administration, Iceland started a new program of commercial whaling with a view towards sales to Japan, triggering calls from conservation groups for the U.S. to levy trade sanctions under the Pelly Amendment. In 2011, in a message to Congress, President Obama concluded that further diplomatic efforts would be undertaken to end [Icelandic whaling] before trade sanctions would be imposed against that Atlantic nation. Marine Protected Areas in the EEZ The Obama administration set an important international precedent for ocean conservation and protection of sensitive marine environments in the expansion of the no-take MPAs in the U.S. EEZs around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands archipelago and Line Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. was then involved indirectly in the U.K.'s establishment of a vast marine protected area in the EEZ around the Chagos Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The U.K.'s protected area excluded from the MPA the waters around Diego Garcia, an atoll that the U.S. leases from the U.K. government for use as a naval base. An UNCLOS tribunal ruled in Mauritius v. U.K. that the protected area was wrongly established in light of Britain's commitment to return the Chagos islands and their surrounding waters to Mauritius once they were no longer needed. Consultations with Mauritius prior to the Protected Area's creation were perfunctory and in violation of UNCLOS duties to consult and behave in good faith with respect to the rights of other coastal states. The U.S. actively supported the creation of MPAs in the waters surrounding Antarctica at meetings of CCAMLR, the commission created by agreement to manage and protect the living resources of the Southern Ocean. Krill fisheries in the Southern Ocean have expanded in recent years as have fisheries for Antarctic toothfish.

History On January 25, 1942, in Sikeston, Missouri, a black man entered the home of two women whose husbands were away in the army. He attacked one of them with a six-inch knife, nearly severing three of her fingers and ripping her abdomen so her intestines spilled out. Neighbors, including the victims grandfather intervened and the attacker fled. Wright was found nearby, walking calmly, with a bloodstained knife in his pants. When arrested, an altercation ensued with Night Marshall Hess Perrigan, who shot Wright eight times. A mob grabbed the unconscious Wright poured gasoline on him and burned him in front of Smiths Chapel. Threats were made to other blacks of the city, and many fled the city. Others armed themselves and guarded the entrance to their neighborhood. Governor Forrest Donnell directed the Missouri State Highway Patrol and Sheriff John Hobbs to assign additional men to the scene. Nearly 100 residents who fled never returned to the community. Afterwards, blacks who had armed themselves and patrolled the community opened a chapter of the NAACP, seeking protection from mob violence. The white community considered the killing justified. Church leaders, while generally negative on the righteousness of lynching, were afraid to speak out one way or the other due to the fear it would \\"drive a wedge\\" between members.

The village, according to the old administrative divisions, was , Volhynian Governorate, Russian Empire. His brothers Anatoly and Fedir also become priests. Nil also studied at seminary. Besides his talent for drawing, Khasevych also had a good voice. In 1918, returning from Rivne, at the Derazhniansky railway crossing, he and his mother fell under a train. His mother died, and he lost a leg. As Neil could cut a variety of wood crafts, he had fashioned his own prosthetic leg. = Education and creativity = With friends in the Warsaw studios. 1930th After treatment, he attended a workshop of Vasyl Len in Rivne. In 1925, he took an external exam and received a certificate of the Rivne Gymnasium. From 1925 to 1926, he worked as an assistant iconographer. With the money received as compensation for the accident, he used it to study at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. The young man graduated from the graphics department, he studied painting with Professors and , and graphics with Professor W≈Çadys≈Çaw Skoczylas. In Warsaw, he then worked with a small circle of Ukrainian artists and students in the Academy, who founded the Society , which included N. Khasevych, P. Andrusiy, V. Vaskivskyy, S. Drychyk, V. Zvarych, , V. Havryliuk and . From memories of the last about his countryman: In 1930 he belonged to the student union Zaporizhzhya. Defending a diploma work on the theme Saint Volodymyr, in 1935, Nil received a diploma of higher art education with the right of teaching in secondary schools. With the beginning of World War II he returned to his village. But even in 1931 his painting Laundry was awarded with the Vatican prize, and the next year, his portrait of Hetman Ivan Mazepa won the Warsaw Academy diploma. Reflecting on the specifics of art, Nil Khasevych made a record on February 24, 1933: To study this language, Neal Hasevych copied by hand with quill pen the Peresopnytsia Gospel. In the process he mastered the Cyrillic font. Gradually moving from oil painting to graphics prints, he begins to engage engravings, and woodcutting (derevorizamy). In the early 1930s, Neil Hasevych exhibited his work in art salons of Lviv, Prague, Berlin, Chicago, Los Angeles. In 1937, he got a third cash prize at the International Exhibition of Engravings on a wood engraving in Warsaw. For two years, he printed an art album called Book marks of Nil Khasevych. This year, in the American city of Philadelphia, his art album, Ex libris of Nil Khasevych, was released. Nil collaborated with the Ukrainian magazine The Way and Volyn word. The artist tirelessly polished professional skills. His portraits of Prince Volodymyr the Great, bookplate of the president of UNR in exile Andriy Livytskyi, and the series of works in the anthology Woodcuts was highly appreciated by experts. He is compared to Ivan Trush, Heorhiy Narbut, and Vasyl Krychevsky. File:–ù—ñ–ª –•–∞—Å–µ–≤–∏—á. –í–æ–ª–∏–Ω—å.jpgVolhynia. Canvas, oil. 1920th File:–ù—ñ–ª –•–∞—Å–µ–≤–∏—á. –ü—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—è.jpgLaundry.

Nil Khasevych was an active public and political figure, and a member of the (VUO) from 1935. He was a delegate to the Regional Congress of the VUO in 1935 in Lutsk. He was personally acquainted with Stepan Bandera and other Ukrainian leaders of the national movement. He was a member of the central and regional OUN leadership, and later, he joined the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council (UHVR). But the impending world war and the fate put him a choice. Along with the work, he is engaged in social and political activities: he took part in the Volhynia Ukrainian association, and later joined the OUN. Since April 1943, when groups of the UPA were formed in mass, he joined the underground work. He was elected to the central and regional leadership of the OUN. From that time, he began a nomadic life. He worked in the , and constantly changed his location because of the constant danger. He was known by the pseudonyms Bay-Zot, Levko, Rybalka, 333, Stary, and Dzhmil. Nil Antonovych was a talented propagandist who led an insurgency printing house. He also worked as an artist and editor, preparing illustrations for satirical magazines of the UPA \\"Ukrainian pepper\\" and \\"Horseradish\\", designed the pappus and leaflets for underground publication, and released an album of caricatures. He also worked on projects of flags, seals, forms for insurgents. During 1943 ‚Äî 1944, he led a political- propagandist unit of the UP \\"North\\" group, commanded by Klym Savur (real name Dmytro Klyachkivskyy). After the death of his friend and leader, Khasevych remained on combat post for another seven years. His portfolio of the war and post-war era ‚Äî 150 woodcuts, which was issued overseas in albums as \\"Volhynia in the fight\\" and \\"Graphics in UPA bunkers\\" during 1950 ‚Äî 1952. In 1941, he became a member of the Labor Union of Lviv, Ukrainian Fine Arts and worked with the Rivne Magazine \\"Volhynia\\" with Ulas Samchuk. In Nazi-occupied Lviv in 1942 ‚Äî 1943, he held an exhibition of Ukrainian artists in which Nil Khasevych exhibited the work of patriotic themes, including \\"Sleep, guys, sleep\\". In June 1948, the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council (UHVR) introduced awards for illegals, which earned them with a personal courage. In particular, \\"Zot\\" created sketches of the Cross of Merit and Cross of Combat Merit and medal \\"For the fight in especially difficult circumstances.\\" Subsequently, the author was awarded the Silver Cross of Merit and Medal and elected to UHVR from Ukrainian intelligentsia. Few know about who he really was, what he was doing and where he was. He was carried from hiding place to hiding place by bicycle. = Circumstances of death = In 1951, from the capital of Soviet Union, an order was sent \\"to suppress anti-Soviet activities\\" () of Khasevych, because the engraving was presented to the delegates of the United Nations General Assembly and foreign diplomats, and then was published in the aforementioned book \\"Graphics in UPA bunkers\\". To search for the artist, which was established in the inter-oblast task force, led by GB Captain Borys Steklyar. It also included, as captain, Markelov, and Kudrytskyi. To the trail of \\"Zot,\\" secret police came several times. Once, in Lviv, through \\"citizen M.,\\" who hid in his place a personal archive of Nil Khasevych. He hid them in a glass jar and buried in the garden. \\"Organs\\" tried to lure and capture him, but to no avail. Later, in one of the captured bunkers, they found encrypted documents. When deciphered, it read: (from which printing cliches for producing cards and prints was made). Ciphering pointed an address: bunker on a farm near village (then Rivne Raion, Rivne Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union), which is 12 km from the town of Klevan, in Rivne Oblast. Khutir was surrounded. Kryyivka was equipped at homesteading. The hidden entrance to the cave was located in a barn near the wood. The bunker itself was relatively spacious, had three-quarters. Here took place last fight of Khasevych and two rebels who guarded him with gebists. From the book of Teodor Gladkov, \\"With shield and sword\\" (), which was published in 1988 in Lviv Publisher \\"\\", we know the details of death of artist and warrior. According to another text, Nil Khasevych shot himself with personal weapons, along with his two bodyguards ‚Äî Vyacheslav Antoniuk ‚Äî \\"Matthew\\" and Anton Melnychuk ‚Äî \\"Hnat\\", burning before all important documents. From the memoirs of Dmytro Udod former UPA soldier: After three days the rebels' dead bodies were taken to an unknown destination. , Ukrainian writer, member of the national liberation movement for the independence of Ukraine and political prisoner, wrote an essay, \\"Barrel,\\" in 1956, which was published in parts throughout 1996 ‚Äî 1998, which also described the death of Nil Khasevych:  Family  World War II decimated virtually all his relatives: his father and his younger brother, Anatoly was killed, and his older brother, Fedir died in a Soviet concentration camp Beloborodovo, near Tomsk.

UHVR offered him to cross to the West, but he refused. Where is his grave is, is unknown. There are in Kostopil, Lviv, Lutsk, Rivne, Kovel, Volodymyr-Volynskyi and Pervomaisk of Mykolaiv Oblast. In 1992, on the death spot of Nil Khasevych, in Suhsvtsy of Rivne Raion, a memorial sign was installed by the artist . Also, there is a monument to the Nil Khasevych in Rivne on . The SBU in Volyn Oblast, in the early 1990s,gave a selection of original woodcuts of Nil Khasevych preserved in the archives to a regional ethnographic museum in Lutsk. And December 26, 2008, the Security Service of Ukraine transferred to permanent storage at the memorial complex The National Museum of Ukraine in World War II 103 original prints of Nil Khasevych and wooden printing blocks for their production, which remained in the storages of the KGB.

The scandal has been cited as \\"the first large match fixing scandal\\" in the CS:GO community. Scandal iBUYPOWER and NetCodeGuides met in an August 21, 2014 match during the CEVO Professional Season 5. iBUYPOWER (iBP) was heavily favored to win the match, but instead lost resoundingly, 16 to 4. What attracted attention at the time of the match was the strange strategies by iBuyPower: they attempted knife kills at odd times and seemed displeased that their tactics failed. Contemporary analyses blamed travel issues‚Äîthe team had just played at ESL One Cologne 2014‚Äîand unfamiliarity with the map. The next day, Dot Esports received a tip consisting of screenshots of a conversation with Shahzeb \\"ShahZaM\\" Khan before the game; in the messages, Khan said the match had been fixed and iBP was to lose. While Khan declared his own innocence, he ultimately refused to reveal who was behind the match fixing. In January 2015, the case resurfaced when a former girlfriend of an iBUYPOWER player posted a string of incriminating text messages between herself and Derek \\"dboorn\\" Boorn. In the texts, Boorn, who by this time had moved on to a new team, confirmed that the match had been fixed and that he had bet for the team using alternate accounts on the popular CS:GO Lounge site. The messages also revealed the identity of the individual who placed the bets on the team: Duc \\"cud\\" Pham, a player, skins bettor and trader. The CS:GO Lounge site, suspecting something was amiss, found that Pham had used nine accounts to place wagers that yielded a return of $1,193.14 each, for a total of $10,738.26 in gains from match fixing; it did not go public until Dot Esports provided additional evidence that linked the teams to the scandal. The revelations came at a time when iBUYPOWER's former players were shopping for a new sponsor, with Evil Geniuses being named as among the potential candidates. Potential non-monetary motivations for match fixing included conflicts of interest between iBP players and NCG, as well as the fact that the win placed NCG one game away from qualification for the LAN finals with just two matches to play. iBP went on to win the LAN Finals, which included a victory over NetCodeGuides.  Consequences and aftermath  As a result of the match fixing, six players and NetCodeGuides owner Casey Foster were permanently banned from all future Valve-sponsored professional tournaments. The banned players were Pham, Boorn, and iBP players Sam \\"DaZeD\\" Marine, Joshua \\"steel\\" Nissan, Braxton \\"swag\\" Pierce and Keven \\"AZK\\" Larivi√®re. Only one former iBP member, Tyler \\"Skadoodle\\" Latham, who was the only member of the squad to not accept the skins, was not banned by Valve.

The FCA describes SM&CR; as an opportunity for financial institutes to establish healthy cultures and effective governance by encouraging individual accountability and setting standards for personal conduct.  Background  The SM&CR; legislation was formed in response to the 2008 banking crisis and significant conduct failings such as the manipulation of LIBOR. UK Parliament passed the proposed legislation in December 2013, leading to the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) applying the legislation to the banking sector from March 2016. Parliament made further legislative changes in May 2016, extending the regime to all FSMA authorised firms. SM&CR; replaced the preceding Approved Persons Regime.  Applicability  The legislation applies to all FCA/PRA regulated banking sector institutes. This includes: banks, building societies, credit unions, UK branches of foreign banks and the largest UK investment institutes. It also applies to all FCA/PRA regulated insurance and reinsurance institutes. This includes: insurers and reinsurers, ISPVs, the Society of Lloyd's, managing agents and UK branches of foreign insurers.  SM&CR;'s three key components * Senior Managers Regime * Certification Regime * Conduct Rules =Senior Managers Regime= The most senior staff at institutes where SM&CR; apply, who perform key roles, are designated as 'Senior Managers'. Senior Managers must be approved by FCA or PRA before commencing their roles. Senior Managers must also have a 'statement of responsibilities' where their responsibilities and accountability is documented. This statement must be part of the institute's overarching 'responsibilities map' and shall cover 'prescribed responsibilities' and 'overall responsibilities' (legislative texts). Institutes must also annually re-certify all Senior Managers as suitable to perform their roles. =Certification Regime= Staff at SM&CR; institutes holding roles that can cause significant harm to the institute (or customers) are designated as 'Certification Functions'. Certification Function role holders do not require FCA/PRA approval, but the institute must annually re-certify that they are suitable ('fit and proper') to perform their role. =Conduct Rules= Most staff engaged in financial services activities at SM&CR; institutes are affected by the so called conduct rules. These are minimum standards for individual behaviour with the aim to improve accountability and awareness of conduct issues across the institute.

It is organized in partnership with the Thai Department of Corrections, an agency of the Thai Ministry of Justice. Prison Fight hosts events inside various prisons in Thailand, with the mission of providing inmates with money, equipment and prepare them to reintegrate society, while having a serious chance at getting their sentence reduced. The program has been featured in notable media such as Esquire, TIME, Huffington Post, New York Post, Al Jazeera, The Telegraph, Vice, Die Zeit, Men's Journal and Bangkok Post. Mission The press conference for Prison Fight held at Klong Prem Prison Dave Leduc vs Thai Inmate at Prison Fight Thailand 2014 Since its foundation, Prison Fight gained widespread attention for its controversial concept where violent inmates can reduce their sentences and even earn their freedom by winning a series of Muay Thai fights against foreign fighters. The ultimate aim of the Thai Department of Corrections through the Prison Fight events, is the implementation of a rehabilitation program to promote sport and good health among prisoners. Development of sports inside prisons walls is believed to minimize internal problems such as diseases, drug abuse and violent behaviour. History The Thai Penal System has a long history of organizing sporting events, from soccer and basketball tournaments to weightlifting competitions. In an effort to modernize the penal system, Thai authorities began issuing sentence reductions to the athletes viewed as bringing honor to their country. In the 1980s, Thai Department of Corrections introduced a program called Sports Behind Bars. This gave birth to the Thai tradition of pardoning outstanding fighters. Muay Thai was one of the first activities offered. Since then, only a handful of prisoners have managed to parlay their skill into an early release. In 2007, the imprisoned drug dealer Siriporn Taweesuk beat a Japanese boxer for the World Boxing Council light- flyweight title in a match held at Klong Prem Prison. Not long afterward, she was released, having achieved, in the words of one Thai official, \\"glory for Thailand.\\" That same year, Amnat Ruenroeng, a muay Thai veteran and convicted robber serving 15 years at Bangkok's Thonburi prison, was pardoned after winning a national title in boxing. He subsequently qualified to represent Thailand at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. =Creation= Prison Fight is the brain-child of an international team of proponents of rehabilitation via martial arts, notably Aree Chaloisuk, former director of the Klong Pai Central Prison, in Nakhon Ratchasima, two hours north of Bangkok, and of Estonian businessman Kirill Sokur. The first three Prison Fight events were held in early 2013 at Klong Pai prison. In past events, Chalernpol Sawangsuk, an inmate competitor in the third event, was released shortly after his victory over British Muay Thai fighter Arran Burton. One of the main reasons the Prison Fight program has captivated the worldwide media is the slogan: \\"Battle for Freedom\\". Many believed the fights were organized as a way for prisoners to fight and secure a pardon, but it appears to be much more than that. Nowadays, Prison Fight established stricter rules for the inmates wishing to participate in the program. They are expected to display exemplary behavior and personal development along with their fighting skills. When it comes to fighting convicts, former notable competitor Dave Leduc said to Bangkok Post : \\"They deserve to get my 100%,\\" adding, \\"If he wins, then he earns it.\\" =Television= In 2013, in early stage of the program, Vice Fightland made a heavily shared short video on YouTube that made the world aware of the Prison Fight program in Thailand. In 2016, the Prison Fight program was the subject of a short documentary, titled Prison Fight, set in both Canada and Thailand. The film tells the story of Sean McNabb fighting Komkit Agorn Ketnawk at Klong Pai Central Prison. Two men from opposite ends of the world with only one thing in common, the art of Muay Thai. In 2017, Prison Fight was featured in the Showtime documentary Prison fighters : 5 Rounds To Freedom. The film is narrated by Sons of Anarchy star Ron Perlman and aims at examining a controversial practice in Thailand‚Äôs criminal justice system. The documentary follows a convicted murderer through redemption. He is granted a Thai Royal pardon after winning a final Muay Thai match against an American fighter. As explained in the movie, they came up with it to capitalize on the popularity of a national sport and exploit the rehabilitative power of fighting‚Äôs discipline. Most events took place in the maximum security Klong Prem Prison. The events are sanctioned by the Thai Department of Corrections and are portrayed as a way for inmates to battle their way to an early release.

It is a 50-minute instrumental suite divided into two parts. The music was composed by Phillips and performed by himself with additional musicians. Background and writing In the 1980s, Phillips's musical output had changed direction towards \\"very simple albums, trying to do pop stuff just to stay alive\\". However, the lack of commercial success with his releases led him to focus on his Private Parts & Pieces series of albums that centred around pieces of a smaller scale. The rise in new-age music towards the end of the decade had prompted him to \\"crank it up a bit\\" and gather material of an orchestral nature that he had written years before and combine it with fresh ideas for a new studio album of a large scale. This marked his first \\"full-scale\\" album since the release of Invisible Men (1983), during which he was able to collect a considerable number of ideas for the project. During the closing stages of his collaboration album Tarka with Harry Williamson in December 1987, Phillips began to write Slow Dance which he initially found \\"daunting\\" and for a while, avoided working on it. Once Phillips had gained some momentum, he recalled that \\"working on a big canvas\\" once more was an exciting one and felt particularly inspired from the frustration in not having been able to have an outlet for the larger scale ideas he had accumulated. Phillips's enthusiasm for the project resulted in four long pieces outlined in two months: one each based on the piano and 12-string guitar, and two of varied styles and arrangements which he thought resembled a film soundtrack. He opted to develop the latter two, keeping the material that he felt had \\"more change, more dynamics, more spacey\\". Phillips also felt encouraged to produce a large scale work to demonstrate to others that he could score full length films. To help fund the album's production, Phillips was able to secure an advance from the US-based independent label Passport Records, something he had been unable to get since the late 1970s. With his earnings from Tarka and a loan from his publisher Hit & Run Music Phillips upgraded his studio equipment, replacing his 8-track recording machine with two Fostex E16 16-track machines and a new Soundtrack mixing desk, thus allowing him to produce more dense recordings. Phillips continued writing which coincided with a positive time in his life; \\"[Everything] just went well at the time which is a good way to be when you are really firing\\". However, after the four pieces had been written, Phillips learned during a subsequent visit to the US in May 1988 that Passport Records had ceased trading, leaving the label unable to pay the promised advance. Phillips felt fortunate that the collapse happened after the material for Slow Dance was complete and not after, as he was sure that he would have abandoned the project. In the course of the following eight \\"nerve racking\\" months Phillips, now without a label, in debt, and with no immediate way of repaying what he had borrowed from management, doubted whether the album would ever be made, let alone released. Phillips considered returning to television work to pay dividends but despite the setback, Phillips chose to carry on and make the album rather than scale it down or abandon it completely: \\"It was a card I felt I had to play, as I had no obvious others\\". He purposefully kept the bad news to himself due to embarrassment yet remained positive, helped by the hope of Slow Dance leading to further work later on. Upon returning from the US, Phillips had to re-record the parts that he had put down. On the fourth day, he accidentally wiped the programmed drum box rhythms that he had made for the composition. Composition \\"Slow Dance\\" is an instrumental composition composed by Phillips that is divided into two parts. He described it as a piece that \\"doesn't hang around\\", as it changes in tempo and mood throughout. The first half, he said, is slow to get going but it covers a greater number of ideas which originate from pieces written between 1984 and 1987. The first five minutes of the composition took two weeks to write. He compared the main recurring melody in the piece sounded like the Enigma Variations by Edward Elgar. One difficulty that Phillips had was arranging the piece so it flowed to whereby \\"at the end of the album, it sort of made sense of what had gone on before\\". As he pieced different sections of music together he wanted them to fit musically \\"in the grander scheme\\" of the composition. In early 1988, during the early stages of conception Phillips replaced the older synthesisers that he had used on 1984 (1981) including the ARP 2600 and Polymoog with newer models such as the Roland Jupiter-8 and E-mu Emax I, his first sampling synthesiser. The Jupiter-8 was used to write and record the string sequence. Phillips maintained that the only computerised part in the recording was when he used the Yamaha QX5 Sequencer on Part Two. When he reached the end of arranging the piece, he looked back: \\"I got the feeling that it was like the end of a journey realising that something that worked at the beginning worked at the conclusion\\". Recording Slow Dance was recorded from June 1988 to March 1989 at a facility named in the album's liner notes as Vic's Place. Its initial working title was Album '88. Having borrowed a sum of money from other sources, Phillips was able to hire a group of session musicians to play the parts he had arranged, a risk he was willing to take as he occasionally had thoughts of the album being successful to the point of relieving him of financial situation. Among them were Ian Hardwick on oboe and Julie Allis on harp, who had played on Tarka, and Martin Robertson on clarinet, who was also on Invisible Men. They were completed with Michael Cox on flute and piccolo and Tjborn Holtmark on trumpet. When Phillips thought the album would benefit from percussion, he asked Frank Ricotti, who had also played on Sides and devised what Phillips described as \\"some wonderful percussion parts\\" after playing the composition to him section by section. As the first side neared completion, Phillips reunited with his longtime producer Simon Heyworth who took an interest in the style of the album. Heyworth advised Phillips on recording for the second part, including the idea of linking the two Fostex machines to make recording easier and more efficient. At the closing stages of recording both parts of the composition, Phillips decided to incorporate a real string section as Heyworth believed the string sound he had achieved on the Jupiter-8 did not carry the music through. Despite Phillips having insufficient funds to cover the cost, Heyworth paid for the session which took place at CBS Studios in central London in February 1989. Phillips noted that the timbre of the real string section and the sampled strings he had played on his keyboards did not match. After Phillips prepared a final mix at home studio, the album underwent digital editing at CBS in March. Dave Turner then completed the final mastering. With the album recorded, Phillips resumed composing for television and library music with the aim of recouping the debts that had mounted from producing Slow Dance. He also had sample copies of the album produced at Chop 'Em Out, a cutting facility in London that was done by Dave Turner. During this time, Phillips felt the album needed a more distinctive working title and now named it Project 2. In the summer of 1989, Phillips was contacted by management at Virgin Records who expressed an interest in releasing the album, having heard one of the promotional copies. He later learned that Simon Mortimer, who had first signed Phillips to Virgin's publishing division for his film and television work, convinced the label to release it and pay the majority of Phillips's debts. Virgin's decision to release Slow Dance also included opportunities for further film and television work and the release of his back catalogue. By the spring of 1990, Phillips had signed the deal. The album's title was decided in the summer of 1990. Phillips said that Slow Dance was the one of many that were thought of throughout its production, including Time & Tide and Field Day. The latter was used for the name of Phillips's 2005 album. Phillips recalled that management at Virgin were not keen on titles that emphasised a new-age record, and had also suggested Responses and Millennium, but a feature film of the latter name was to be released so he scrapped it. Slow Dance was suggested by someone at Virgin who considered the album accompanying music for a ballet. Release Slow Dance was released in the UK in September 1990, and the final of Phillips's to have a simultaneous release on CD, vinyl, and cassette. Phillips recalled the critical reviews being \\"very mixed\\", but looked back on the album as one of the projects he was more proud of, partly because of the \\"broader canvas\\" that he was able to work from which led to a work with \\"greater emotional pull\\". On 16 June 2017, Slow Dance was reissued as a 2 CD/1 DVD Deluxe Edition digipack by Esoteric Recordings which contains the original and a new stereo mix, a 5.1 surround sound mix, and previously unreleased tracks collectively titled Slow Dance Vignettes. The package includes a poster and 16-page booklet with extensive liner notes. The new mixes were produced using records \\"pretty near the original masters\\" which Phillips and his engineers thought sounded \\"fifteen to twenty percent better\\" than using generation copies. In 2015, Phillips expressed his wish to produce another studio album \\"like 'Slow Dance', in that sort of genre\\".

The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros or simply the Vietnamese rhinoceros. Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific name R.s. annamiticus is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, which was part of its range. In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of seasonal tropical forest of Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago.van Strien, N.J., Steinmetz, R., Manullang, B., Sectionov, Han, K.H., Isnan, W., Rookmaaker, K., Sumardja, E., Khan, M.K.M. & Ellis, S. 2008. Rhinoceros sondaicus. In: IUCN 2008. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The last known individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010, and some conservation groups believe that the subspecies is extinct.  Threats  A painting from 1861 depicts the hunting of R. s. sondaicus As with many other species, the two main factors in the decline of the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros populations has been loss of habitat combined with over-hunting. Poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they are believed to have healing properties. Because the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros's final range encompassed an area of human poverty, it is difficult to convince local people not to kill an animal that could be sold for an enormous sum of money.
