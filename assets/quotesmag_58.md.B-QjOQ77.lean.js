It aired on 10 September 2008 in the Afternoon Play slot as part of Radio 4's Big Bang Day which celebrated the switching on of CERN's Large Hadron Collider that same day. Andrew Marr introduced the audio play live from CERN. An mp3 version of the audio play was freely available until 18 September, when the play was released on CD and as a purchasable download. Plot Torchwood Three are chasing a Weevil through Cardiff Bay. Dr. Martha Jones phones Captain Jack Harkness, requesting help. Jack immediately agrees to meet Martha when she says people are disappearing from the CERN facility in Switzerland, where she's working. Martha suggests they go undercover, and Torchwood set off for Geneva. Gwen Cooper says there aren't any records of the disappearances, but instead on the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC. Jack explains to her and Ianto Jones that CERN seeks the 'Higgs Particle', the fundamental particle of existence. CERN had found a way of examining the building blocks of matter itself; and built the world's largest particle collider which runs from Switzerland to France, in a 27 km round tunnel. Jack excitedly states that the plan is to collide protons moving at the speed of light together, to produce what would effectively be like the \\"Big Bang\\". Jack guesses the people may have discovered something unusual and were forcibly removed. He explains that the particle collision is thought to expose parallel dimensions, create black holes or turn the world inside out. After noticing Gwen and Ianto's expressions, Jack assures them that it would all be fine since it's theoretical. Meeting in Geneva, Martha and the others discuss how they're coping since Toshiko Sato and Dr. Owen Harper's funeral. Gwen replies they're okay, and Martha says she's been spending her time working in Switzerland. She informs Torchwood about her missing friend, Julia Swales. Working as a CERN doctor, Julia realised people were falling ill with undiagnosable symptoms. The patients were sent to a hospital in France because of this, but upon contacting the hospital, Julia was informed the 11 patients never arrived. Julia told Martha, but UNIT couldn't find anything wrong. Martha called Torchwood when Julia disappeared, knowing she'd need their help. Martha and the team head to the facility, where a reception for the LHC is being held. Martha introduces Ianto as the Welsh Ambassador and Gwen as his wife to the guard, Jack being their assistant. Arriving in what Martha calls an 'underground city' - where the research takes place - the team view the housing of ATLAS, the largest particle detector (Gwen and Ianto describe it as a jet engine the size of the London Eye), and are met by Professor Katrina Johnson. Being informed that the collider countdown has started, Martha introduces her UNIT boss, Dr Oliver Harrington, who dismisses claims of side effects from the collider activation. Martha mentions his wife's death and that his coping mechanism is to work. She leads them to an ill patient, Leon, who worked as a technician in the tunnel. There aren't any physical signs of injury, and Martha states that he is comatose. Gwen suggests a deep tissue scan, amazing Martha. Gwen mentions that Owen was working on its adaptation before he died. The readings aren't comprehensive; Leon's skin starts glowing. As Martha tries to help Leon, he speaks in a strange voice. Jack suggests they find a link between the patients; Gwen and Ianto head to the control room to hack computers, himself and Martha remaining. They talk about Owen and Tosh; Jack stating he needs to be strong for Gwen and Ianto. Martha doesn't believe it, and Jack dismisses her, lamenting his immortality and the fact he couldn't save them, blaming himself. Gwen and Ianto search for the patients. According to their findings, the missing people were all in the tunnel when they became sick. Martha notes that Leon is disintegrating, discovering that his neutrons are missing. Jack reveals he'd seen a colony fall victim to a creature the same way. As Gwen and Ianto search for links between the tunnel and the collider, Jack and Martha inform them about Leon. The creature in question feeds on neutrons in the body. They deduce that the bodies are in an unmarked building, and Martha heads there while Jack goes to the Professor. Gwen and Ianto head to the tunnel to locate the creature. Jack instructs them to scan for creatures and not to engage with them, before they split up on bicycles. Meanwhile, the activation of the collider is about to begin. As Professor Johnson makes a speech, Jack demands the closure of the operation. He reveals himself as Torchwood, explaining that a creature slipped through during a test in May. The Professor asks him about the missing people; Jack assuming she is feigning. Martha contacts Gwen and they talk about Owen and Tosh. Gwen says she can't accept they're gone and that the funeral didn't give her the closure she wanted. Martha finds the building and attempts to enter. After commenting on the lack of sonic screwdriver, she breaks in using a rock, finding Julia and the others in comas. In the tunnel, the creature poses as Owen, Tosh and Lisa Hallett, tempting Ianto to 'help' them return to life. Gwen contacts Jack, who is trying to stop the activation, informing him that Ianto has found the creature. Martha also contacts him, reporting that she'd found the building and the missing people, who are all glowing. In the tunnel, Ianto is torn between going to Gwen and succumbing to the alien posing as Lisa. Martha, trying to help Julia and the other patients, is held at gunpoint by Dr. Harrington, who reveals himself to be behind their storage. As Gwen reaches Ianto, she resists the alien as she helps Ianto. Ianto expresses his sorrow over losing Tosh, Owen and Lisa, and begs to be with them. Professor Johnson prepares for lockdown. Jack suggests they use CERN's Anti-Proton Beam Facility to reverse the polarity of the magnets; combining a proton beam and an anti proton beam will cause them to cancel each other out. Dr. Harrington arrives with Martha and demands control. In the tunnel, Gwen struggles with Ianto, who has begun to glow. Harrington states that he'd been contacted by his wife (the creature), and thinks all the dead can come back to life if he helped his wife. Martha tells him that their neutrons are missing and that his wife isn't coming back. He exits, Martha following him. As Gwen and Ianto struggle towards the exit, Ianto remarks the irony of seeing the wonders of the universe before dying in a tunnel in Switzerland. Gwen reassures him and herself and the alien tempts her to release it. In the Anti-Proton Beam Facility, Jack and the Professor note that they'll see the Higgs Particle because the proton beams will hit the anti proton beams instead, exposing it. They are informed that Harrington activated the tunnel shut down sequence. Gwen and Ianto meet Harrington in the tunnel and he helps her to get them out. Martha arrives and before they can stop him, Harrington heads back to the tunnel, locking himself in. With the tunnel locked down the collider is activated, creating the anti proton beams. Martha informs them about Harrington, Jack realising it's too late to help him. In the tunnel, Harrington and the creature perish in the tunnel as the collider is activated. Jack notes that the comatose patients should return to normal. The Professor thanks Jack before he returns to Gwen, Ianto and Martha. Ianto thanks Gwen for helping him, although he cannot remember any of it, and Martha reports that all the patients have returned to normal. As Ianto quotes Tennyson, Gwen asks why the human race 'needs to be ready'. Jack simply says that they're worth fighting for, which the others dismiss. Jack says they never stop searching for answers - even when they don't know what the questions are - and that makes them special. Jack states that the answer is somewhere out there, and that sometimes asking the question IS the answer, before they head home. =Continuity= The Torchwood team are still grieving the deaths of their colleagues Owen Harper and Toshiko Sato. They have not seen Martha Jones, who is working for UNIT, since the funeral. Upon greeting Martha, Jack welcomes her with the words \\"voice of a nightingale\\", the phrase he greeted her with upon her arrival in the Torchwood episode \\"Reset\\" and upon commencing their telephone conversation in the Doctor Who episode \\"The Stolen Earth\\". The team are heard in pursuit of recurring Torchwood monsters Weevils and reference is made to Martha's fianc√©, Thomas Milligan, a character seen in the Doctor Who episode \\"Last of the Time Lords\\" and her friend Julia Swales, a character seen in the Doctor Who episode \\"Smith and Jones\\". An alien creature poses as the ghosts of Owen, Toshiko and Ianto's deceased girlfriend, Lisa Hallett, a character seen in the Torchwood episode \\"Cyberwoman\\". Jack uses the phrase \\"reverse the polarity\\", a phrase associated with the Third Doctor in Doctor Who. The Bekaran deep-tissue scanner first appeared in the Torchwood spin-off novel Another Life and Martha mentions the sonic screwdriver, a device used by the Doctor. Ianto's phrase on dying in a tunnel in Switzerland also echoes the Ninth Doctor's line on dying in a cellar in Cardiff in \\"The Unquiet Dead\\". Writing CERN was involved in the production of Lost Souls from its inception; according to writer Joseph Lidster, \\"they're apparently big Torchwood fans.\\" Representatives from CERN read the script to check for scientific accuracy; they also approved the plot, which required \\"that if the team were going to CERN, something had to go wrong\\". When Lidster began writing the script, he did not know that the characters of Owen and Tosh would be killed in the episode \\"Exit Wounds\\", so the characters were included in his first treatment. He subsequently introduced the theme of grief into the episode, to address the characters' reactions to their friends' deaths. Broadcast and reception Lost Souls was commissioned and broadcast as part of Radio 4's \\"Big Bang Day\\", a day of special programming commemorating the switch-on of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. As part of the \\"Big Bang Day\\" coverage, James Gillies, director of communications for CERN, wrote an article for Radio 4's website comparing the fictional LHC of Lost Souls with the real LHC: \\"The CERN of reality bears little resemblance to that of Joseph Lidster's Torchwood script. The geography is all wrong and there's no way that anyone could be in the accelerator tunnel while it's running. The cool down happens inside a long blue tube, so the tunnel itself does not get cold. I could go on, but that would be churlish. By ignoring reality, by rearranging geography and by playing with time in his own way, Lidster creates drama.\\" Gillies added \\"Captain Jack displays a surprising knowledge of particle physics.\\" Prior to the special's broadcast, the prospect of a radio version of Torchwood yielded mixed responses from the critics. Writing in The Sunday Times, Paul Donovan celebrated the special, particularly the contributions of the \\"beguiling\\" and \\"sympathetic\\" Freema Agyeman; of the special and the rest of the Big Bang Day programming, Donovan said, \\"This is the sort of output we pay the licence fee for, the sort of ambitious and expensive programming no commercial radio station could ever hope to do in the present ecology of broadcasting.\\" However, at The Times, Chris Campling lamented \\"a special radio episode of the terrible Dr Who spinoff Torchwood, set at CERN and involving the supernatural. It's as though Radio 4 approached the point of serious educational broadcasting ‚Äî and then disappeared into the black hole of celebrity.\\" According to John Barrowman, Lost Souls was the most downloaded radio or television that day on the BBC's iPlayer site, leading to a further three radio episodes being commissioned.

A biography provided by the John Templeton Foundation and published by PBS online states this book \\"has been credited with literally creating the contemporary field of science and religion.\\" Contents The book is divided into three parts. The first part is concerned with the history of science and religion, the second with the methods of science and religion, and the third with the issues themselves. Barbour provides introductions to several schools of philosophy in order to give the reader knowledge enough to understand how relations between science and religion look from these distinct viewpoints.Issues in Science and Religion (1966), page 115 The book also includes several specific, non- philosophical areas of science are employed in its discussion. Several specific concepts and objects are brought up in the discussion generally along with summaries of significant criticisms.  Part 1: Religion and the History of Science  In this part Barbour provides an overview of how scientific discovery has influenced theology throughout the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The major scientific discoveries made in the 17th century included those made by Galileo and Newton. The scientific discoveries made by Galileo and Newton began to describe and explain the natural and physical laws by which the earth operates. These discoveries drastically changed the way that man viewed the world and nature. This in turn caused shifts in theological thought. Natural theology emerged, where God was able to fill the scientific gaps and was responsible for the orderliness of nature. The idea of God as the \\"Divine Clockmaker\\" and the beginning of Deism can also be traced back to the 17th century. During the 18th century the Age of Reason and Romanticism greatly shaped views on science and theology. Deism became very popular during this time among many Enlightenment scholars. Romanticism, on the other hand, led to an appreciation of the underlying spirituality in nature and in man, and God's personal relationship with man and nature. This in turn led to the concepts of moral and religious experience, which focused on man's intuition and imagination in relation to their religious experience. The theory of evolution was developed by Darwin in the 19th century. This essentially eliminated the \\"God of the gaps\\" that had come about in the 17th century. Liberal theologians accepted the theory of evolution, and held the opinion that God works continuously through the evolutionary process. On the other hand, conservatives still insisted on Biblical literalism, and they rejected Darwin's theory. For the most part theologians began to focus more on the human experience for their basis of theology. In the next two parts of the book, Barbour goes into details of the 20th century.Barbour, Ian. Issues in Science and Religion (1966). Part 1.  Part 2: Religion and the Methods of Science  In this section a whole chapter is devoted to the methods of scientific discovery. Barbour asserts that scientific discovery is based on a critical realism, where it is recognized that scientific theory is not infallible in itself but is based on universal truths. Due to this line of thinking, as scientific knowledge changes an overall advance is made. The next chapter compares the study of science to the study of history. This chapter focuses on the objectivity of science versus the subjectivity of history. History is seen as subjective because one is dealing with the humanities and there is a level of personal involvement. Although throughout history certain patterns of human behavior emerge, these patterns are never entirely predictable or repeatable. Where in science, all events that are observed must be repeatable and produce the same results in order to uphold natural laws. The following chapter examines the methods of religion. In this chapter some comparisons are made between the methods of science and the methods of religion, in particular regarding experience, community and the use of models to explain an event or concept. Although there are parallels between the methods of science and religion, there are also difference. One major difference is the same as the difference between science and history. Like history, religion is subjective due to the personal involvement required of religion. The final chapter of this section discusses the language used in religion and science. This chapter asserts that although there are many similarities in the methods and language of science and religion, the two subjects remain distinctly different in their purposes.Barbour, Ian. Issues in Science and Religion (1966). Part 2.  Part 3: Religion and the Theory of Science  The first chapter in this section examines contemporary physics, in particular indeterminacy as shown in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This indeterminacy in the behavior of atoms can be generalized to apply to humanity as a whole. This argument rests on the unpredictability of a single person and their action. Barbour concludes this chapter by stating that although physics can be used to explain human freedom to some extent, it will never produce an entirely satisfactory argument for it. The next chapter addresses how the idea that man is simply a machine that can be broken up into respective systems and thus is completely predictable, is not satisfactory in the scientific world. It can be seen through science and the study of DNA, that each human has a unique identity and sense of selfhood. This is supported biblically, in that God's love for each human being is unique to that person. The next chapter expresses varying viewpoints on creation and evolution, from conservative to liberal theology. In more conservative lines of thought biblical literalism points to the creation of man as a divine point in creation, and therefore rejects the idea of man evolving from other life forms. The liberal side of theology embraces the theory of evolution, and incorporates it with scripture into a doctrine of continuing creation. The final chapter in this book examines God's relation to nature. There are many different views on how God is related to nature. Those who hold more conservative views believe in God's sovereignty over nature. Others look at God's role in nature through a historical context, where God has evoked certain responses in nature throughout the course of time.Barbour, Ian. Issues in Science and Religion (1966).

Published in Murfreesboro, it serves as the primary local newspaper, with competition from The Murfreesboro Post and other publications. The newspaper is not in competition with The Tennessean of Nashville, as both are owned by Gannett. Gannett acquired DNJ from Morris Multimedia in 2004. The roots the DNJ date back to 1849 and the founding of Murfreesboro News. This paper would eventually merge with several competitors, and in 1931, the daily Home Journal and Murfreesboro News-Banner joined to form The Daily News Journal. DNJ currently publishes daily local papers, and also prints two weekly editions titled Smyrna A.M. and Rutherford A.M. From 1951, DNJ occupied the Brady- Tompkins-January-McFadden house at 224 N. Walnut St., which was originally built prior to the American Civil War.

The ward is bounded by (clockwise from north) Portswood Ward, Bitterne Park Ward, Peartree Ward, Bargate Ward and Freemantle Ward. The ward is part of the Southampton Test constituency.  Origins  The ward was created by the Boundary Committee Review in 2002 out of parts of the old St Lukes Ward and Bargate Ward to the south. The name change was proposed by Southampton City Council and the Liberal Democrats, the latter arguing that ‚Äúthe conversion of St Lukes Church to a Sikh temple has removed the sole surviving landmark bearing the former ward name,\\" and that the new name better reflected local community ties. In contrast with St Lukes, the name Bevois has a strong attachment to the area, which contains landmarks such as Bevois Town Primary School and Church, and Bevois Castle Pub and Hotel. These landmarks, like the area, gleaned their names from the legend of Bevis of Hampton, who was said to have thrown up the mound of dirt that became Bevois Mount to obstruct the Danes in their endeavours to cross the River Itchen. In the 2011 Census 39.2% of the population of Bevois Ward was born outside the UK.

The group is led by Kalidas Baidya. Major General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, the Director General of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), in a talk with the Director General of the Border Security Force (BSF) Ajay Raj Sharma in 2004 said that the extremist group Banga Sena was carrying out terrorist and secessionist activities against Bangladesh from its bases in the Indian state of West Bengal. Khodeza Begum in an article in the Global Politician accused India of helping to organize the Banga Sena. In March 2006, a senior official of the home ministry of Bangladesh expressed concern over the anti-Bangladesh activities by the Banga Sena. Regarding this he added that Bangladesh wants a peaceful border with neighboring India and the situation has vastly improved following coordinated border patrolling by the both countries. A Bangladeshi official stated that the organization is a \\"threat to the sovereignty of Bangladesh\\". More than 400 members of the Banga Sena were arrested in India on February 18, 2003 for trying to cross over into Bangladesh from the district of North 24 Parganas in southern West Bengal. According to police sources, activists belonging to the organization began gathering at the Indo-Bangladesh border at Halencha, North 24 Parganas in the jurisdiction of the Bagda police station since morning that day. In January 2004, the director general of the Bangladesh Rifles gave a list of the camps of the remaining Shanti Bahni elements in the North-East Indian states of Tripura and Assam and in adjoining Indian provinces to the director general of the Border Security Force. The list documented that the Banga Sena, along with several other groups, carried out communal tension and separatist activities against Bangladesh from West Bengal. Indian Foreign Secretary said that India will cooperate in tackling the Banga Sena and other insurgent groups. On September 2007, the representatives of two NGOs, Diphu Citizen Peace Forum and Karbi Human Rights Watch, in the Karbi Anglong District of Assam said that the Banga Sena was involved in extortion and it could pose a threat to the peace in the region. Regarding the activities of the Banga Sena, the Foreign Secretary of Bangladesh Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury made it clear that his country will not tolerate any statement or move against its territory or sovereignty. The All India Minority Forum, an organization for religious minorities in India, also expressed concern over this organization.

It is administered by the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) under the Department of National Defense (DND). The Council is responsible for ensuring the protection and welfare of the people during disasters or emergencies. The NDRRMC plans and leads the guiding activities in the field of communication, warning signals, emergency, transportation, evacuation, rescue, engineering, health and rehabilitation, public education and auxiliary services such as fire fighting and the police in the country. The Council utilizes the UN Cluster Approach in disaster management. It is the country's focal for the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) and many other related international commitments. Council membership In February 2010, the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) was renamed, reorganized, and subsequently expanded. The following heads of agencies compose the NDRRMC: Local DRRM Offices According of Republic Act 10121, various local governments throughout the country should establish Local DRRM Offices at the regional, provincial, municipal, city and barangay levels. As functional arms of the local governments, these Offices are responsible to create a Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan according to the Framework of the NDRRMC covering 4 aspects including disaster preparedness, response, prevention and mitigation, and rehabilitation and recovery.NDRRMC Framework Local Offices usually have a Chief DRRM Officer supported by Administrative and Training, Research and Planning, Operations and Warning Officers. Some of these Offices have advanced to organizing their own search and rescue and emergency medical services squads and command- control-and-communications centers. Disaster response =Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda)= The NDRRMC was in charge of gathering and reporting data in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan. On November 15, 2014, the agency reported 5,632 deaths, 1,140 people missing and 12,166 injured. The agency has reported the rose of death toll to 6,190 deaths, 1,785 missing and 28, 626 injured. They also estimated that the typhoon cost damage to the infrastructure and agriculture of the Visayan Region. As of April 17, 2015, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council confirmed total of 6,300 deaths including 5,877 of those taking place in the Eastern Visayas. =Mount Pinatubo Eruption= When the population was put into a state of alert during the first phases of the Pinatubo crisis, authorities from the NDCC showed indisputable efficiency in managing the people.Fr√©d√©ric, Leone, and Gaillard Jean-Christophe. \\"Analysis of the institutional and social responses to the eruption and the lahars of Mount Pinatubo volcano from 1991 to 1998 (Central Luzon, Philippines).\\" GeoJournal no. 2 (1999): 223. JSTOR Journals, EBSCOhost.  Precautionary Measures Before Sensing an Eruption  Prior the eruption, no precautionary measures were taken until signs of activity were observed in 1991. This could be attributed to the absence of any oral or written records of volcanic activity for the past 400 years in the surrounding areas.Newhall, Christopher G., James W. Hendley, and Peter H. Stauffer. The cataclysmic 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines. Vancouver, WA?: U.S. Geological Survey, 1997.  Precautionary Measures After Sensing an Eruption  By April 3, 1991, PHIVOLCS, after having concluded that the volcano was reawakening, decided to evacuate Aetas villages that were lying within a radius of 10 km around the summit. On May 13, 1991, a 5-level warning and evacuation system was constituted. This system included a concentric danger zone surrounding the volcano, continuously fixing four radii of evacuation from 10 to 40 kilometers between June 7 and 18, which mostly depended on the evolution of the threat. On the day of June 26, 1991, orders of evacuation were conveyed to local authorities or Coordination Councils (DCC). During those times, the entire zone located within the 10 km radius around the crater of Pinatubo has been decreed as permanent high risk sector by PHIVOLCS prohibiting all human occupation of the zone.Fr√©d√©ric, Leone, and Gaillard Jean-Christophe. \\"Analysis of the institutional and social responses to the eruption and the lahars of Mount Pinatubo volcano from 1991 to 1998 (Central Luzon, Philippines).\\" GeoJournal no. 2 (1999): 223. JSTOR Journals, EBSCOhost. In the time of Pinatubo‚Äôs eruptive phase in June 1991, most of the population reacted favorably to the evacuation orders due to the early preparation and coordination efforts the authorities on the field have demonstrated. However, there were still some Aetas that changed their minds and decided to return to the mountains seeking refuge in caves and spiritual comfort from their God. There were also others that refused to leave, having been convinced that the expected eruption would not be extreme enough to reach their homes, and having been scared at the thought of having to abandon their belongings and crops. By the time the second warning was given out in July 1992, the population, having been more aware of previous events, were much more prepared. Despite the PHIVOLCS frequent pleas and the population‚Äôs positive response to it though, a total of 300 Aetas families still refused to evacuate. Post-disaster Recovery Under the DRRM Act, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) is designated as the lead agency for the recovery. NEDA is mandated to coordinate the recovery support functions of national government agencies, local governments, and civil society organizations (CSOs). However, during the recovery from super typhoon Haiyan, NDRRMC was caught unprepared due to the typhoon‚Äôs overwhelming impacts. It was in this context that the government, through the President‚Äôs Memorandum Order 62 of December 2013, created the Office of the Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery (OPARR) to focus exclusively on coordinating the recovery process. OPARR aims to unify efforts of the government and other institutions involved in recovery. It has special power to mobilize the full resources of the country and to expedite the decision-making process under the direct authority of the President. OPARR was dissolved after two years.

Additionally, Wang commended the Somali federal government on its peace-building efforts. He likewise reaffirmed the historically close diplomatic ties between both territories, recalling China's recognition of the nascent Somali Republic in 1960 and Somalia's subsequent campaigning which helped the lawful Chinese government resume its position on the United Nations Security Council.

Silvan Tomkins created script theory as a further development of his affect theory, which regards human beings' emotional responses to stimuli as falling into categories called \\"affects\\": he noticed that the purely biological response of affect may be followed by awareness and by what we cognitively do in terms of acting on that affect so that more was needed to produce a complete explanation of what he called \\"human being theory\\". In script theory, the basic unit of analysis is called a \\"scene\\", defined as a sequence of events linked by the affects triggered during the experience of those events. Tomkins recognized that our affective experiences fall into patterns that we may group together according to criteria such as the types of persons and places involved and the degree of intensity of the effect experienced, the patterns of which constitute scripts that inform our behavior in an effort to maximize positive affect and to minimize negative affect.  In artificial intelligence  Roger Schank, Robert P. Abelson and their research group, extended Tomkins' scripts and used them in early artificial intelligence work as a method of representing procedural knowledge. In their work, scripts are very much like frames, except the values that fill the slots must be ordered. A script is a structured representation describing a stereotyped sequence of events in a particular context. Scripts are used in natural language understanding systems to organize a knowledge base in terms of the situations that the system should understand. The classic example of a script involves the typical sequence of events that occur when a person drinks in a restaurant: finding a seat, reading the menu, ordering drinks from the waitstaff... In the script form, these would be decomposed into conceptual transitions, such as MTRANS and PTRANS, which refer to mental transitions [of information] and physical transitions [of things]. Schank, Abelson and their colleagues tackled some of the most difficult problems in artificial intelligence (i.e., story understanding), but ultimately their line of work ended without tangible success. This type of work received little attention after the 1980s, but it is very influential in later knowledge representation techniques, such as case-based reasoning. Scripts can be inflexible. To deal with inflexibility, smaller modules called memory organization packets (MOP) can be combined in a way that is appropriate for the situation.  References  * Nathanson, Donald L.

This highly-eccentric three-week orbit takes it approximately 0.0523 AU of the star at periastron before swinging out to approximately 0.2665 AU at apastron. Its eccentricity is about the same as 16 Cygni Bb, a so-called \\"eccentric Jupiter\\". Until 2009, HD 17156 b was the transiting planet with the longest orbital period.TransitSearch (See: HD 80606 b)  Discovery  The planet was discovered on April 14, 2007 by a team using the radial velocity method on the Keck and Subaru telescopes. The team made an initial negative, transit search, but they were only able to cover 25% of the search space. This left the possibility of a transit open. After the possibility of a transit was discussed on oklo.org, various groups performed a follow-on search. These searches confirmed a three-hour transit on October 2, 2007 and a paper was published two days later.  Name  The planet was originally named \\"HD 17156 b\\", being the second object in the HD 17156 system. The star was given the name \\"Mulchatna\\" by the IAU, chosen by United States representatives for the NameExoWorlds content, with the comment that \\"The Mulchatna River is a tributary of the Nushagak River in southwestern Alaska, USA\\". Its parent star was simultaneously named Nushagak in the contest.  Orbit  To-scale diagram of the planet's orbit. The gray line indicates the transit window. Careful radial velocity measurements have made it possible to detect the Rossiter‚ÄìMcLaughlin effect, the shifting in photospheric spectral lines caused by the planet occulting a part of the rotating stellar surface. This effect allows the measurement of the angle between the planet's orbital plane and the equatorial plane of the star. This planet's spin-orbit angle was initially measured by Narita in 2007 as +62 ¬± 25 but has been remeasured by Cochran +9.4 ¬± 9.3 degrees. The study in 2012, refined the misalignemt angle to 10¬∞. Due to its high eccentricity and large distance from its star, HD 17156 b is expected to never enter a secondary eclipse of the other planet in its system. The star's true temperature cannot be measured with accuracy. Due to the high eccentricity of its orbit, the atmosphere of HD 17156 b undergoes a 27-fold variation in stellar flux during each orbit.

Ernst Hoepffner and Prosper Alfaric offer La Chanson de sainte Foy for their 1926 edition. a hagiographical poem about Saint Faith, is an early surviving written work in Old Occitan and has been proposed to be the earliest work in Old Catalan. It is 593 octosyllabic lines long, divided into between 45 and 55 monorhyming laisses.The most popular division is Thomas' division into 49 laisses (see Work, p. 366; Riquer, p. 198). It was written between 1054 and 1076, during the reign of Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona, by an anonymous poet.A brief overview of the Can√ß√≥ and the arguments for its date and language placing it in the context of Catalan literature, see Mart√≠n de Riquer (1964), Hist√≤ria de la Literatura Catalana, vol. 1 (Barcelona: Edicions Ariel), p. 197-200.For an overview of the content of the work and a thematic analysis, see Elisabeth P. Work (1983), \\"The Eleventh-Century Song of Saint Fides: An Experiment in Vernacular Eloquence\\", Romance Philology, 36:3, pp. 366-385. The place of its composition is controversial. It may have been written in the region around Narbonne. On the other hand, it may belong to the Roussillon, either to the monstery of Sant Miquel de Cuix√†, where relics pertaining to Saint Faith are to be found, or that of Sant Mart√≠ del Canig√≥. In Roussillon in the eleventh century, the name Faith (Fides) was relatively common. Other suggested regions include Provence, Cerdagne, and Quercy. The language or dialect of the poem is also debated, since on it hinge the nationalist pride of Catalonia and the thesis that Catalan and Occitan, the language of southern France, were indistinct before the fourteenth century. Ernst Hoepffner (1926) argued that it was \\"certainly not Catalan\\".Riquer, p. 198 n1. Mart√≠n de Riquer (1964) agrees that \\"one cannot affirm the Catalanity of this beautiful and ingenious poem indubitably\\".Riquer, p. 198. Aurelio Roncaglia (1961) suggests it was written in the lingua d'oc (Occitan) but ai margini della Catalogna (on the margins of Catalonia). As early as 1581 Claude Fauchet believed it was vieil espagnol, pour le moins cathalan (old Spanish, at least Catalan), but the manuscript Fauchet worked from disappeared.The manuscript was Is. Vossii codex Latinus oct. No. 60. A catalogue of Fauchet's library appears in Urban T. Holmes and Maurice L. Radoff (1929), \\"Claude Fauchet and His Library\\", Publications of the Modern Language Association, 44:1, pp. 229-242\\\\. See p. 238 and note 39, where it is classified under \\"Miscellaneous\\". The compilers note that Fauchet claimed to have received the manuscript from Pierre Pithou. See also S. W. Bisson (1935), \\"Claude Fauchet's Manuscripts\\", The Modern Language Review, 30:3, pp. 311-323. It was rediscovered in 1901 among the works of Ausi√†s March in the library of the University of Leiden by Jos√© Leite de Vasconcelos. It had evidently been misplaced in 1716 based on its misidentification as a work of March's in 1562. In 1962 J. W. B. Zaal studied Fauchet's manuscript and on the basis of the words razo espanesca found in the Can√ß√≥, determined that it was culturally transpyrenean. The manuscript history further supports the notion that the language of the Can√ß√≥ is of a more Iberian dialect (so that it could be mistaken for late medieval Catalan). Martyrdom of Saint Faith in a late medieval illustration The Can√ß√≥ is a versified narration of the martyrdom of Saint Faith in Agen (c. 300).For an argument that the Can√ß√≥ is the earliest verse narrative combining lyric poetry and dance in a Romance language, and the earliest piece of surviving Occitan literature, see the introduction of Rob√®rt Lafont, ed. and trans. (1998), \\"La Chanson de sainte Foi\\": Texte occitan du XIe si√®cle (Geneva: Droz). It is primarily based on the now lost Latin Passio sanctorum Fidis et Caprisii, though seven Latin sources have been identified, including the De mortibus persecutorum of Lactantius. Elisabeth Work divides it into two distinct parts: a conventional chanson de saint that lasts the first 41 laisses and is based on the traditional sources, and an original chanson de felon corresponding to the final eight laisses.Work, p. 366. The first part is eloquent and polished, while the latter part is mediocre, often attributed to the phrase a lei francesca, which is taken to indicate that the poet was composing in the manner of the Old French narrative lay. The poet himself narrates the final part with an air of disgust appropriate to the felonious content. Everywhere, however, his language is orthographically, lexically, and rhythmically consistent. According to the final lines of its razo (prologue), the Can√ß√≥ was popular in the regions of Vasconia, Aragon, and Gascony, where the people can affirm its truth: : : : : Editions * Antoine Thomas, La chanson de Sainte Foi d'Agen: po√®me proven√ßal du XIe si√®cle, 1974. * French translation by Antoine Thomas on Wikisource Notes Category:Old Occitan literature Category:Medieval Catalan literature ","title":"Can√ß√≥ de Santa Fe"},{"id":"18211790","text":"The Arnold family is an American political and military family with ties to New England, Georgia and Ohio. The descendants of American Revolutionary War general Benedict Arnold in Great Britain, while not particularly politically active, also achieved notable success in the 19th century. History William Arnold was one of the founding settlers of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and one of the 13 original settlers of Providence. He was the son of Nicholas Arnold of Northover and Ilchester in County Somerset, England by his first wife Alice Gully. William was born in Ilchester on 24 Jun 1587, and all four of his children were also born there. In 1622 he was the warden of St. Mary's Church in Ilchester, and remained in that town until immigrating to New England in 1635. One remarkable aspect of his emigration from England is that he had copied baptismal records from the parish registers of Northover and Ilchester and brought these with him to the New World, beginning a record that would eventually encompass six generations of his family. In New England William Arnold first settled in Hingham in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but within a year joined Roger Williams in founding the settlement of Providence on the Narraganset Bay. By 1638 William had moved to the Pawtuxet River, five miles south of Providence, and lived there the remainder of his life, dying some time in 1675 or 1676 during the turmoil of King Philip's War. William's son Benedict Arnold was the first Governor of Rhode Island under the royal charter of 1663. Other members of the Arnold family came to Boston from England in 1687. The. Rev. William George Arnold, a minister, was charged with the task of establishing a parish of the official religion of England, the Church of England in Boston. Upon arrival he found he was disliked in Boston and quickly learned that no one would sell land for the construction of a church that was not Puritan. He established King's Chapel in Boston in 1689 on public land. William was soon followed from England by his brother Edward Arnold, who opened a successful general store in Boston. Edward Arnold brought two daughters with him from England. The older of the pair, Charlotte, married the Puritan minister Ebenezer Punderson in 1730. He was a Yale graduate and was ordained as a Puritan minister in 1729 and began serving as the minister of the Congregational Church in North Groton (now Ledyard), Connecticut. It seems that her Church of England upbringing and beliefs made an impression on her husband, as he announced his intention to be ordained in the Church of England and left his Congressional Church and was ordained in London in 1734. He erected a parish of the Church of England in Preston, Connecticut in 1735 and at a service attended by William and Edward Arnold the place was consecrated St. James' Church. Upon the 1737 death of William Arnold, many of his children moved to Connecticut near Preston and St. James' Church where the climate for Church of England members was less harsh. The family prospered in Connecticut and married well. One of Gov. Benedict Arnold's descendants Benedict III married his cousin Mary Arnold (who was descended from the William George side of the family) and gained control of the family estate in Norwich. They named their first son Benedict IV, who died in infancy. Their second son, Benedict Arnold V, became a general and war hero but is now best known as an infamous turn-coat for his treasonous attempt to surrender West Point and subsequent flight to the British side during the war. During the American Revolution the family became active in politics. The William George Arnold side of the family remained fiercely loyal to English rule while the Benedict side favored independence. Jonathan Arnold (1741‚Äì1793) became a member of the Rhode Island Legislature in 1776 and then a delegate to the Continental Congress from Rhode Island from 1782 to 1784. After the revolution much of the family left New England for Savannah, Georgia, where they opened a number of mills.

Close to the Baltic Sea and the Hanseatic city of Rostock, it is the most important religious heritage of the European Route of Brick Gothic. It is the remaining part of the Ex-Cistercian Doberan Abbey, dedicated in 1368. The first abbey in Mecklenburg, founded in 1171, which was also used as the burial site for the regional rulers, became important both politically and historically. Through the activities of its inhabitants, the abbey greatly contributed to the cultural and economic development of Mecklenburg and became the centre of Christianity in this region. No other Cistercian abbey in Europe can lay claim to such a large amount of the original interior remaining intact. Among the treasures are the main altar which is the oldest winged altar in art history, the monumental cross altar and the sculpted tomb of Danish Queen Margarete Sambiria. Even after the reformation and the dissolution of the abbey in 1552, the church continued to serve as the main burial place for the ruling Mecklenburg nobility as well as the place of worship for the Evangelical-Lutheran congregation. The Minster in Bad Doberan is said to be the most important medieval building in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the best example of medieval creativity put in practice and it is a building of the highest technical and artistic perfection. The furnishings on display are of highest artistic quality. No other church in northern Germany has such complete and historically important liturgical furnishings. The mostly well preserved Cistercian furnishings are unique. The abbey is a unique and precious artistic monument in the coastal region of the Baltic Sea.  Architecture  A pillar supporting the vaulted ceiling The Doberan Minster is a unique symbiosis of a high gothic cathedral building, based upon French cathedral style and elements of other Hanseatic churches as well as influence by the building code of the Cistercians. The Cistercian Order was created in 1098 in France as a reformist movement of the Benedictine Order. The ideas for living together are based on the rules of St. Benedict from the 5th century. The Cistercian order was strongly influenced by Bernard of Clairvaux who joined at the beginning of the 12th century. The basic rules of monastic life were humility, poverty and obedience. Poverty as a rule meant that no monk was allowed to hold any personal possessions and also that abbey churches were to be kept simple, without decorations or ornaments. In the early Romanesque style Cistercian churches, some of which are partially maintained, it is easy to recognize the simple, smooth forms, sparse decorations and furnishings. In around 1280, the construction of the second abbey church was begun and was consecrated in 1368. The Cistercian reform, which demanded simplicity in design and furnishing, was 200 years in the past and had little influence on the second church building. During trips to France, the monks of Doberan were inspired by the gothic churches there. They returned with new ideas and implemented them here. Also in the surrounding Hanseatic cities, churches were built in gothic style. The regional dukes influenced construction even further. Duke Pribislav of Mecklenburg was a sponsor of the monastery in Doberan and was later buried in the church. The Doberan Minster became the most important burial site for the Dukes of Mecklenburg, who donated money for its continuing development. The foundations of the Minster are set into sandy soil with integrated wedges of gravel at the meeting point of 3 creeks. The groundwater is approximately 1.5 m below ground level. The surrounding area was mostly marshland. This wasn't an ideal site for building, especially not for building a monastery with a church of such dimensions. Therefore the foundations had to be set very deep, to guarantee a safe and stable building. Contrary to other religious orders, the Cistercian monks looked for remote, difficult to access sites to establish their monasteries. Thus they made a large contribution by cultivating arable land and were well liked by the dukes. With no real stone or sandstone available, brick was used as building material. To produce bricks they mixed sand, clay and water and filled wooden forms which then dried and were baked in field ovens. It took three years to produce a brick. These bricks, the so- called abbey form, were about 30 cm long, 15 cm wide, 9.5 cm high and weighed around 8 kilograms. The cement of limestone for the brick joints was free of gypsum to prevent expansion and erosion thus guaranteeing a long life span.  Elements  = The main altar = Doberan M√ºnster, choir with the high alar and tabernacle (left). The altar was created around 1300 as an enclosed altar by unknown artists. It is not only the oldest wing altar in Germany, but also the oldest in art history. The upper and middle sections date back to that time. The upper row depicts stories from the New Testament which match the depictions of the Old Testament in the middle row. The New Testament is represented on the left wing depicting the joy of Mary and on the right wing the suffering of Mary. Until around 1400, the figure of Mary on the candle holder was in the middle niche of this altar. The wooden figure was then replaced by a large monstrance and several holy pictures. Furthermore relics and monstrances were stored in the shrine. All of these were lost during the 30 Years War. Around 1350 the lower row was added, depicting the apostles and the two patron saints St. Sebastian and Pope Fabian. The upper row on the left wing shows: John the Baptist, the annunciation of Mary, the birth and dedication of Christ. On the right wing: the scourging of Jesus, Jesus carrying the cross, the crucifixion and the resurrection. The middle row on the left wing shows: Eve, Sara, the closed gate, the burning bush and the dedication of Samuel. On the right wing: Moses striking the rock, the suffering of Job, Abraham offering Isaac, the iron serpent, Samon and the city gates of Gaza. The lower row on the left wing shows: St. Fabian, apostles Bartholomew, Thomas, Simon, Matthew, Andrew and Peter. The right wing shows: apostles Paul, Jacob the elder, Evangelist John, Phillip, Judas the Galilean, Matthew and St. Sebastian. = The Tabernacle = It was built between 1350 - 1360 in the form of an enormous Gothic style monstrance, probably by the same carver who made the lower row of the main altar. The 11.60 metre high carving is made of oak and is the oldest tabernacle of its kind in Germany. On the same level as the statue of Mary is the compartment that held the host until the dissolution of the abbey. In the space above there was probably a monstrance displaying a host. The figures are all relating to the celebration of mass. The depictions starting in the lower front and going clockwise are: King David with a harp, Abel offering a lamb, Moses and manna, St. Bernard, the prophetess Deborah, priest and king Melchisedek and on the upper level: Mary, mother of God, John the Baptist, St Peter, St Jacob, St Paul, St John the Evangelist. = The chalice cupboard = The chalice cupboard (about 1300) The chalice cupboard, to the left of the tabernacle, is an exceptionally unique showpiece, created around 1310. There was room inside for 20 sets of utensils for celebrating mass (chalices, plates, jugs, spoons), probably for the 2 main and 18 side altars of the abbey church. Brick residue on the sidewalls show that the cupboard was originally built into a wall. Worth noticing are the figures on the outside of the doors, depicting Mary, Christ, St Paul and Ezekiel, and the original paintings (only cleaned, never retouched) on the inside of the doors. There you can see Abel with the lamb and Melchisedek with the chalice, as a sign of the death offering of Jesus Christ. On top you can see Jesus giving his blessing. = The credenza = To the left is a credenza (around 1300). It is part of the original furnishings of the Gothic Minster and was carved from oak wood, like most of the other medieval wooden artifacts of the minster. It served for the preparation of liturgical utensils used when celebrating the Eucharist at the main altar. = The Levite pews = The lower parts of the Levite pews originate from the 14th century. The canopy is a reconstruction from the 19th century. The Levites' seating, a pew for three, was the place for the monk, the deacon and sub deacon celebrating mass. = Ornamental candle holder = Above it hangs an ornamental candle holder prominently showing the statue of Mother Mary in the late Roman - early Gothic style from the time of 1280. This figure stood from 1300 onwards as the central statue in the middle section of the main altar. Around 1400 it was integrated into the newly created candle holder. Here she is portrayed as an apocalyptic Madonna with a crown of stars, the sun and the crescent moon, as in the Book of Revelation 12.1: \\"and there appeared a woman, clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars.\\" On top of the baldachin you can see the script \\"AVE MARIA\\" (\\"Hail Mary\\") as the infinite prayer of the Cistercian monks to their main patroness. = The eagle lectern = The eagle lectern in front of the main altar was made of copper in the 19th century by the copper smith Steusloff from Doberan as an imitation of a lectern originally found in the cathedral of Hildesheim. The eagle is the symbol of Christ and faith being victorious over evil. It was restored in 2002. Behind the lectern are the tombs of Duke Heinrich II (the lion) von Mecklenburg (died 1329) and Nicolaide von Werle (14th century). The tombs are covered with medieval mosaic tablets, which are protected by metal grids (19th century). = Choir stalls = Although nearly 700 years old, the rows of choir stalls have been preserved in excellent condition. These were built during the period from 1300-1370 and they were used by the monks for holding their seven daily prayer services. The stalls were originally placed a few metres eastwards towards the main altar. The reason for the longitudinal positioning of the stalls lies in the fact that the Gregorian hourly prayers were sung alternately by the monks on either side. The canopies above the stalls, with intricately carved roses, are of the highest quality and were completed around 1380-1400. The ornamental work was done in a style matching the cross altar (1360) and was followed by work done on the octagon (1420). Of special interest are some unique carvings on the pew ends: the pelican style pew end with the vine, ivy and the eagle. Near the lectern are pew ends with carved lilies and monks (1310). The latter ones show, in the upper part, the annunciation of Mary and, in the lower part, St. Benedict, the founder of the Benedictine Order and the author of the rules of monastic life as well as St. Bernard of Clairvaux, the spiritual father of the Cistercian Order. = Double sided cross altar = Nave with 14th century cross altarThe double sided cross altar and the Lettnerwand, taller than a human, divided the monks\`choir pews in the eastern part from the lay brothers' seating in the western part. The altar was probably created under the supervision of a Bohemian or south German master builder, with the help of north German master Bertram von Minden. The time of creation is dated 1360-1370. It is the most monumental of its kind in Europe. For the dedication of the church in 1368 the greater part of it was probably finished. The double sided cross altar shows, on the western side, Christ, the predella and the cross of triumph and on the eastern side the shrine of relics, an altar and the cross shaped \\"Good Tree of Mary\\". The paintings on Mary's side of the cross altar: from the left: annunciation of Mary (Luke 1, 26-38), the signs to Gideon (Judges 6,36-40), birth of Christ (Luke 2,6-16), Moses and the burning bush (2. Moses 3,1-8), presentation of Jesus in the temple (Luke 2,22-35), presentation of Samuel in the temple (1. Samuel 1,24-28), escape to Egypt (Matthew 2,13-15). On the cross from the bottom to top: Striking the rock with Moses and Aaron (4. Moses 20,1-13), Evangelist Matthew (angel), spies with grapes (4. Moses 13,17-33), Judith and Holofernes (Judith 13), Mary with Jesus (central picture), Esther in front of Ahasuerus (Esther 5,1-8), Evangelist John (eagle), crowning of Mary (without biblical background). To the left: the sprouting rod of Aaron (4. Moses 17,8-9), Evangelist Mark (lion). To the right: Evangelist Luke (Taurus), the closed gate to the sanctuary (Ezekiel 44,1-3).  The tree of life  The cross is shown as the tree of life - true to the words of Christ: \\"I am the vine and you are the branches\\" (John 15:5). The portrayal of Christ as the life-giving and triumphant tree, conquering Satan, is one of the most important symbols of medieval Christianity. The cross, which brought death, is not seen as an instrument of torture but through the resurrection of Christ it came to be understood as a symbol of eternal life. Certain figures or stories from the Old Testament influenced scenes, persons or statements in the New Testament. The symbolic pictures on the side of Christ to the left of the altar are: Christ on the Mount of Olives (Matthew 26,36-46), Elijah at Mount Carmel (2. Kings 1), Christ in front of Pontius Pilate (Matthew 27,24-26), the Scourging of Jesus (Matthew 27,26-30), the story of Job (Job 2,1-10), Jesus carrying the cross (Matthew 27,31+32), the Fall of Man (1. Moses 3,1-5). On the cross from bottom to top: Abraham offering Isaac (1. Moses 22,9-14), Jacob fighting the angel and the stairway to heaven (1. Moses 32,23-33 + 28,11-22), Samson and the city gates of Gaza (Judges 16,1-3), Abel and Melchisedek (1. Moses 4,4 + 14,18-24), Christ on the cross (centre picture), the striking of the rock (2. Moses 17,1-7), Elijah and the widow of Zarephath (1. Kings 17,10-24), marking the servant of God with the seal (Revelation 7), to the left: the iron serpent, to the right: David kills Goliath (1. Samuel 17, 4 (38-51) 58). In the half round areas on the cross arms are heads of prophets. = Pieces of medieval glass = In the upper window valuable pieces of medieval glass (1300) were joined together during the 19th century to show images of Mother Mary and John the Evangelist. Originally the chapel of the von Oertzen family was located beneath the window. The only things remaining from it are the chapel window sponsored by the von Oertzen family, to the left a medieval tomb stone of one of the family of von Oertzen and to the right the memorial plaque for Siegfried (died 1441) and Hermann von Oertzen (died 1386) with the inscription: ‚ÄúIn the year of our Lord 1441 on the 11th day of July Siegfried von Oertzen passed away in the holy land and is buried on Mount Zion. In the year of our Lord 1386, the knight Hermann von Oertzen passed away.‚Äù = The western part of the Minster = Up to the former Lettnerwand and the cross altar was, as in all Cistercians abbeys, the room for the church services of the lay brothers. The pews of the lay brothers are mostly original and complete and are dated around 1280. The round shape of the separating walls, the console style penance seating and the small Romanesque semi-columns all belong to this period. The canopies with their ornate carvings were added later on and were modelled after the choir stalls in the eastern part of the church. Please note the artfully carved pew ends. The carving of an eagle with oaks and fig leaf depicts a scene in which the devil wants to tempt a lay brother. The script says: \\"Brother, what are you doing here? Come with me!\\" and the stoic lay brother replies: \\"You will not find anything bad on me, you repulsive beast, depart from me!\\". Another pew end shows a pelican representing the sacrifice of Christ, yet another pew end shows a lion representing the risen Christ. One pew end shows a wolf and dragon, from whose mouths vine and hop grows. Thus these evil creatures bring forth goodness. The chalice shaped Romanesque baptismal font from the 13th century, is made from limestone and was brought in from the isle of Gotland. It was originally part of the interior of the Church of St. Mary's in Wismar. = Pews for the dukes = The western window from the 19th century is the largest window of the Minster and was restored in 1996. Parts of the medieval pews were used when re-doing the pews for the dukes (19th century). They were placed between the southern rows of the monks and the lay brothers' pews, diagonally across from the pulpit. = Face of the astronomical clock = Face of the astronomical clock Above the western entrance is the face of the astronomical clock, which was destroyed during the 30 year war. It was built in 1390 by Nicolaus Lilienfeld according to the belief of a geocentric universe. The clock was originally located on the western wall of the southern transept, above the steps to the monks dormitories. The four corners depict famous philosophers and astronomers of ancient times. = The granite sarcophagus = of Great Duke Friedrich Franz I. von Mecklenburg (died 1837) took 16 years to finish and was put in front of the high altar in 1843. It was moved to its present place in the western part of the Minster in 1976. Friedrich Franz was the first Great Duke of Mecklenburg and founded the first seaside health spa in 1793 in Heiligendamm. He chose Doberan as summer residence for the dukes of Mecklenburg and thus brought growing fame to Doberan. = Medieval tomb stones and pictures = In the side aisle, valuable medieval tomb stones of abbots have been arranged as a new display in 2004 and 2005. These tomb stones were originally in the crossing. After the reformation they were moved and set into the church floor. During the late 19th century the master builder M√∂ckel removed them from the church floor and integrated them into the side walls. They were removed from the side walls, desalinated, restored and set, at a distance, against the walls, permitting a constant flow of air to avoid further damage. The tomb stones are now placed as follows: to the right side the two nameless abbots, followed by the abbots Martin I. (died 1339), Jakob (died 1361), Martin II. (died 1391), Johannes Plate (died 1420) as well as the vicar von Neuburg, Hermann von Giwertze (died 1449); to the left the abbots Gottschalk (died 1391), Hermann Bockholt (died 1423), Bernhard (died 1441), Johannes Wilkens (died 1489), Franz Meyne (died 1499) and Heinrich M√ºtzel (died 1504). Above these tomb stones are the pictures of Duchess Anna von Brandenburg (died 1567), the spouse of Albrecht VII., Duke Albrecht VII. von Mecklenburg (died 1547), Johannes VI. von Mecklenburg (died 1474), Albrecht VI. von Mecklenburg (died 1483), Johann V. von Mecklenburg (died 1422), Heinrich IV. (the Fat) von Mecklenburg (died 1477), Albrecht II. (the great) von Mecklenburg (died 1379), Pribislav, duke of the Obotrite tribe and founder of the abbey Doberan, the first Christian ruler of this region (died 1178) and Niklot, duke of the Slavs (died 1160). = Pieces of medieval glass and stone tablets = This window was restored from 1978-1980. Valuable pieces of medieval glass (1300) were used in the restoration process. The abbey started operating two glassworks in the 13th century. During the glass making process various pigments from natural resources, for example earths, salts or metal- oxides were added to the colourless heated glass to achieve unique colour schemes. The coloured glass sections were then held together with strips of lead. Then the ornamental motives were painted. Despite early Cistercian rules stressing simplicity, the entire abbey church was completely fitted with coloured windows during the 14th century. Depicted are John the Baptist, Virgin Mary with the Christ child in Bethlehem, John the Evangelist and beneath him Duchess Anastasia von Mecklenburg (died 1317), who sponsored a window for the abbey church. Beneath the windows are stone tablets commemorating the victims of war and violence. The church community added the two outermost plates in 1985, 40 years after the ending of World War II. They name some places of murder and cruelty and admonish us to keep peace and justice. = The von B√ºlow Chapel and the organ = The von B√ºlow Chapel (Room of silence) was named after the family von B√ºlow. For three quarters of a century the bishops of Schwerin came from this family. The interior frescos were painted in 1873 since most of the medieval frescos were lost. Depicted are bishops, several family members and, on the eastern wall, the crucified Christ with John and Mary as well as Saint Thomas of Canterbury and Knight Olav. In front of the chapel is the tomb stone of Magister Hermann Kruse (died 1599), the first Lutheran pastor taking office in 1564. Magister Kruse is shown carrying a layman's chalice which was in accordance with the reformatory convictions of that time. This depiction of the chalice is a statement of evangelical teaching meaning that the Lutheran belief is the proper religion. Tomb stone restored 2007. The organ, built in 1980 by the organ builder Schuke from Potsdam, is above the von B√ºlow Chapel. The first organ was installed in the Minster around 1600, the second organ was built and installed by the organ builder Friese from Schwerin. Today's organ has 3220 pipes, 44 registers and three manuals. It is played during church services, organ recitals and concerts. Starting in May through September concerts are held every Friday at 19:30. The present organ gallery was the gallery of the House von Mecklenburg during med medieval times. = The Chapel of Pribislav = Pribislav Chapel in north transept. The Chapel was the burial place and chapel of the House von Mecklenburg since 1302. It was named after Duke Pribislav, founder of the abbey, who died in 1178 in L√ºneburg. His remains were transferred to Doberan in 1219. In the chapel there are numerous noteworthy exhibits. In the eastern wall a partially medieval window, dated to the 16th century, shows Mary with Jesus as a child, God the father and the Evangelist John. In front of it there is a late-Gothic cross (1480) from L√ºbeck and two cupboards (14th century). It is assumed that the cross was originally in the inner yard of the abbey. In front of the altar is the tombstone of the first Lutheran bishop and administrator of Mecklenburg, Magnus III (died 1550). He was a friend of Philipp Melanchton. Furthermore there is the tombstone of Duchess Ursula, the mother of Magnus III. Set into the northern wall is a renaissance script epitaph, in Latin and German, for Magnus III with the Duke's coat of arms. To the left there are several memorial plates of the nobles buried here and below it are medieval stone slabs displaying heraldic animals (14th century) to mark the ducal graves (restored in 2005/06). Beneath the organ gallery you can see the painting of Great Duke Friedrich Franz I. von Mecklenburg, the founder of the first German seaside health resort in Heiligendamm, in 1793. The marble sarcophagus serves as final resting place for Princess Feodora von Reu√ü (died 1918), wife of Duke Adolf Friedrich von Mecklenburg. Next to it is the tomb stone of Duke Pribislav (died 1179) thought to have been mistakenly placed on top of the grave of Duke Heinrich I von Mecklenburg (died 1302) sometime during the 19th century. Inside the archway to the organ gallery, valuable wall paintings were preserved showing vines and the suffering Jesus, dated 15th century. On the pillar to the choir there are two statues, one of Duke Balthasar (died 1507) and the other of Duke Erich (died 1508). Both are dated from the transitional period between Gothic and Renaissance. These are epitaphs of the highest quality. The colourful tile paintings on the central column in the north transept (a similar one is in the south transept), were created in the 14th century based on oriental designs. The central column, the arches in the crossing, the rafters beneath the vaulted ceilings and the side columns stabilise the church building which was built in a swampy area. On the other side the tomb stone of Duchess Anna von Mecklenburg (died 1464), the daughter of Heinrich IV von Mecklenburg and sister of Magnus II. = Mill Altar, scale model and a tomb stone = The \\"Mill Altar\\" (1410/20) was created as one of the first of its kind. The middle section shows a very picturesque depiction of the transformation of the word to the flesh, or the Eucharist. The four evangelists pour the word of God into the mill funnel, the mill in cross form represents Jesus Christ and shows the place of transformation, the 12 apostles power the mill and the four church fathers catch the trans- substantiated nourishment in a chalice and pass it on to the believers. On the side section, scenes from the life of St. Martin are portrayed. The scale model of the Abbey shows the abbey buildings at the time of the dissolution in 1552 with the crosswalk and numerous side buildings. Several of those buildings are still intact today e.g. the charnel house (1250) to the north of the Minster as well as the grain storage and the ruins of the trade building (1290) to the south of the abbey grounds. The abbey wall, 1400 metres long, remains nearly as it was in medieval times. On the other side is the tombstone of Heinrich von der L√ºhe, restored in 2004. It shows the inscription \\"In the year of Our Lord 1401, on the day of the martyr Vincentius, the good Heinrich von L√ºhe, a sincere friend of the abbey, died and is resting under this stone. May he rest in peace. Amen.\\" = Tomb of Lord Samuel von Behr and a swan and antlers = The tomb of Lord Samuel von Behr (died 1621) was built by Julius D√∂teber from Leipzig and the canopy was erected in 1626 by Cheer Evert Pilot. Samuel von Behr was chancellor, marshal, minister, manager and mentor of Duke Adolf Friedrich who had this memorial erected in gratitude to his mentor. To the right of the chapel and opposite, the swan and antlers remind us of the abbey's founding legend. After the first abbey was destroyed, Duke Nikolaus from Rostock looked for a new building site for the abbey. The new abbey's building site would be the place where the first stag was killed in the hunt. The Prince killed the stag here. The monks surveying the site thought that this ground would be too wet as it was swampland. However suddenly a swan rose out of a thicket into the air and shouted \\"dobr, dobr\\" (Slavic = good) which the monks took as a sign from God, and decided to build the abbey on that spot. \\"dobr\\" ‚Äì> Doberan (Slavic = good place). = Figure of Queen Margarete of Denmark and three altars = The late-Romanesque, early-Gothic figure of Queen Margarete of Denmark (died 1282) carved from oak, is supposed to be the oldest tomb sculpture in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the oldest female sculpture of all Cistercian abbeys (see picture next page). After Margarete's husband Christopher I. of Denmark was murdered in his homeland, she made a journey to Rome and upon her return lived as a contributor and inhabitant of the Holy Cross abbey in Rostock. Although she lived in Rostock, she was buried in the Minster, since that was the place where the Dukes and Duchesses of the House von Mecklenburg were buried. To the right, behind the tomb sculpture, the centre section of the altar of the crucifixion of Christ (1340) depicts seven women representing the seven virtues: obedience, persistence, compassion, love, humility, justice and peace. This rare exhibit is based on Isaiah 4.1 which tells of the struggle of the virtues for the human soul: Christ died so that the virtues could come into the world and the place where the virtues reign there the Kingdom of God has come. On the inside of the wings you see the prophets, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah and Daniel. On the outside of the wings you can see the annunciation scene with Mary, the birth of Christ, the 3 kings worshipping and the dedication in the temple. The altar was renovated 2003/2004. The Altar of the Passion of Christ from the 14th century with parts of a further side altar, is only partially preserved. The Corpus Christi Altar with The Last Supper (1330 - see picture) shows one of the oldest tablet paintings in Mecklenburg. It is thought to have stood in the gate chapel at the western gate of the abbey, and is associated with the Doberan holy blood relics. The tablet is attributed to the second quarter of the 14th century. The left folding wing section was already missing around the year 1700. = Tomb and crypt of Duke Adolf Friedrich I = Tomb and crypt of Duke Adolf Friedrich I von Mecklenburg (died 1658) and wife Anna Maria von Ostfriesland (died 1634) was built by Julius D√∂teber from Leipzig and Daniel Weber from Rostock in the transitional style of renaissance to baroque in 1634. The monument is made of limestone, the ceiling is of carved wood with tiny inlaid mother-of-pearl windows. The carved life size figures of the duke and duchess were done in Spanish fashion which was the dominant style at that time. After the looting during the 30 year war, Adolf Friedrich had the roof and furnishings renovated in 1637. = The Octagon = is an octagonal burial chapel for 13 dukes of Mecklenburg, built or reconstructed in 1420 using Romanesque columns and capitals from around 1240. The location behind the high altar was a privileged burial place. Note the ornamental carvings along the balustrade. The wall paintings on the Octagon, restored in 2004, depict King Albrecht III of Sweden (died 1412), Duke Heinrich III (died 1383), Duke Johann IV (died 1422) as well as Duke Magnus I von Mecklenburg (died 1384). = Tomb of King Albert of Sweden = Grave monument to King and Queen of Sweden. Tomb of Duke Albert III of Mecklenburg, King of Sweden (died 1412), buried in the octagon, and cenotaph of his first wife Queen Richardis (died 1377, buried in Stockholm), is an important example of Gothic burial art (see picture). Swedish nobility voted for Albert to become the Swedish King. After a reign of 25 years, in the year 1389, he was defeated in battle by the Danish Queen Margaret I. From then on his power and influence was limited to Mecklenburg. The lion and dog beneath the figures symbolize strength and loyalty. Worth noticing are the beautifully arranged folds of Richard's dress in Gothic style. = The memorial statue of Duke Magnus II = The memorial statue of Duke Magnus II von Mecklenburg (died 1503) is said to be the most complete form of an epitaph. In his right hand he holds a dagger and wound around his head is a death bandage. Magnus was an energetic ruler, enacting fundamental land reforms which showed his farsightedness concerning economic and financial matters. Two similar statues are on display in front of the Pribislav chapel. = Tomb of Duke Johann Albrecht II von Mecklenburg = Tomb of Duke Johann Albrecht II von Mecklenburg (died 1920) and his wife Elisabeth von Saxony- Weimar-Eisenach (died 1908) was created in 1910 by the master builder Winter from Braunschweig. It consists of a pedestal of grey-blue Norwegian Labrador, roofed by a ciboria made partially of Italian marble, which is decorated with a valuable glass-mosaic. Johann Albrecht travelled extensively as the president of the German colonial society. The style of the tomb was influenced by Byzantine style of buildings in Ravenna as well as by Prussian-style architecture. = The rear of the Levite pews = The lower parts of the Levite pews originate from the 14th century, the baldachin and the rear are a reconstruction of the 19th century. In the display cases, literature, postcards and souvenirs which can be bought at the cashiers booth. = Picture and text plaque of Peter Wise = The Tour through the Minster are best started at the right hand side of the entrance in the southern wing. On the southern wall you'll see the translation of the \\"Dedication Certificate\\" from 1368, the memorial tomb stone of Heinrich von der Weser and his wife (14th century), the memorial burial plate of Peter Wise (died 1338), a merchant from L√ºbeck and sponsor of the abbey. Above it is the picture and text plaque of Peter Wise in German and Latin. It mentions three altar donations from Wise and shows him dressed in the fashion of the 14th century. = Renaissance style ducal epitaph = On the western wall is a Renaissance style ducal epitaph made of four separate marble plates. It was made in 1583 at the request of Duke Ulrich and his wife Elizabeth, Duchess of Mecklenburg, born Princess of Denmark. The epitaph honours all members of the House of Mecklenburg laid to rest in the Minster up until that time. This epitaph exceeds all others in style and form and was restored in 2006. In the southern transept located on the wall are also the paintings of Duke Christian Ludwig von Mecklenburg (died 1692), Duke Adolf Friedrich I von Mecklenburg (died 1658) and of his wife Anna Maria von Ostfriesland (died 1634). Underneath the tomb stone of Johannes Moltke (died 1388) and his wife Margaretha (died 1391). Next to it is the tomb stone of Knight Heinrich Moltke and Katharina Moltke. Both stones were restores in 2006. In the corner to the right is a limestone pillar from the 13th century, which was probably moved here from some other, now nonexistent, building of the abbey.

The Vesta mission would have consisted of two identical probes (just like earlier Soviet Venus missions), to be launched in 1991. Similar to the Vega program, each spacecraft would deploy one or more landers or balloons into the Venusian atmosphere, and then proceed to its next target. At Venus, a French satellite dedicated to asteroid flybys would be released. It would return for an Earth gravity assist, and then reach about 3‚Äì3.3 au from the Sun. There they would fly by some smaller asteroids, and Vesta, if possible, with a small probe landing there. The exact targets would depend on the launch date. In the initial 1985 study, 2700 possible trajectories were analyzed for a launch date in 1991/1992. Considering all constraints, about 12 candidate trajectories were selected. The two identical spacecraft could have different trajectories and targets. These included 5 Astraea, 53 Kalypso, 187 Lamberta, 453 Tea, 1335 Demoulina and 1858 Lobachevskij, and comet Encke. Spacecraft design Around 1985 Vesta was changed to be a Mars mission, with the asteroid mission unchanged. Detailed plans called for each probe to visit four small bodies, including asteroids belonging to different classes - providing a representative sample of the diversity of asteroids - and probably one or two comets as well. Visiting at least one Apollo-Amor (Earth-nearing) asteroid was also given a preference. Preliminary studies called for at least the following scientific instruments to be included: * a wide angle camera (~6.5¬∞ field of view, 512√ó512 pixel CCD) * a narrow angle camera (~0.5¬∞ field of view, 512√ó512 pixel CCD - 3.9 arcsec/pixel) * a near-infrared spectrometer (measuring between 0.5‚Äì5 Œºm with Œª/ŒîŒª = 50, 5 arcminutes per pixel) Possible further instrumentation: * UV spectrometer (for imaging during a comet flyby) * radar altimeter/radiometer * a dust detector * ion or neutral gas detector Onboard memory would be about 240 Mb. Images at closest approach (~500 km) could have a resolution of 10 m/pixel. Worst case downlink rate is 600 bit/second (if not using NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN)). The scientific payload is about 100 kg. The spacecraft had 750 kg dry mass, and carried 750 kg propellants, and possibly a 500 kg penetrator. 20 square meters of solar panels provided 350 W of power. If DSN support could have been obtained, Doppler tracking of the Vesta spacecraft's movement could accurately determine the mass of the encountered bodies. Should it not, another possibility was considered: releasing a test mass, and observing its movement near the target asteroid. The spacecraft's structure was derived from telecommunication satellites (INMARSAT), having the required mass, volume, and delta-v capabilities (3-axis stabilized, with a pointing platform with 2 axes of freedom for scientific instruments). Trajectory The Mars gravity assist constrains the possible trajectories. The asteroid penetrator also imposes limits on the speed of the approach of the target asteroid (less than 4 km/s). Nevertheless, 3 possible trajectories were designed, with two Mars gravity assists. A single Mars swing-by is also possible, but the double gravity assist increases the mass budget of the spacecraft by 30%, at the cost of an additional 1.8 year in travel time to the asteroid belt. The following trajectories are for the 1994 launch window. The size and type of each asteroid is also shown here: Trajectory 1: :launch from Earth :Mars gravity assist :flyby of 2335 James (a 10 km X-type asteroid) (an Amor-asteroid) :Mars gravity assist :109 Felicitas (C-type, 76 km) :739 Mandeville (EMP(?) type, 110 km) :4 Vesta (V-type, or Vestoid. Has a diameter of 570 km) flyby with 3.5 km/s. A penetrator is released. Total delta-v: 450 m/s Trajectory 2: :launch from Earth :Mars gravity assist :flyby of the 157P/Tritton short period comet :Mars gravity assist :2087 Kochera(30 km?) :1 Ceres (flyby & releasing a penetrator) Total delta-v: 1150 m/s Trajectory 3: :launch from Earth :Mars gravity assist :1204 Renzia (10 km?) (an Amor-asteroid) :Mars gravity assist :435 Ella (U type, 30 km) :46 Hestia (F type, 165 km) :135 Hertha (M type, 80 km) Total delta-v: 350 m/s In other studies 11 Parthenope, 19 Fortuna and 20 Massalia were also considered. Cancellation A combination of factors, probably including changing Franco-Soviet relations, the partial failure of the Phobos mission, financial troubles and the disbanding of the Soviet Union, prevented the project from advancing beyond the planning phase.

Place in the Liturgy In the Ashkenazi liturgy, the prayer is usually chanted by a chazzan for the ascension of the souls of the dead on the following occasions: during the funeral; at an unveiling of the tombstone; Yizkor (Remembrance) service on the four of the Jewish festivals, Yom Kippur, Shmini Atzeret, and the last day of Pesach and Shavuot; on the Yahrzeit on a day when there is public reading from the Torah, or the closest date before the Yahrzeit; and on other occasions on which the memory of the dead is recalled. In the Sephardi liturgy, a similar prayer is called Hashkavah and is recited by the reader of the Torah on Mondays and Thursdays. The recitation of the prayer in both Ashkenazi and Sephardi liturgies is usually accompanied by pledges for the donation of charity in memory of the deceased. Wording of the Prayer PowƒÖzki Jewish cemetery in Warsaw The prayer has a fixed structure, composed of a specific text in which is incorporated the deceased's name (in the case of an individual's commemoration), or a description of the deceased (in the case of the commemoration of a group). =Version for a deceased individual= The text of the mourner's prayer varies slightly depending on the gender of the one for whom is said.

The gas balloon Double Eagle II over Presque Isle, Maine attempting to cross the Atlantic Double Eagle Gondola Early life and education Born Max Leroy Anderson in Sayre, Oklahoma, to rancher and mining industry executive Carl Anderson. He entered the Missouri Military Academy at Mexico, Missouri, at the age of eight, and throughout his high school years assisted his father in building pipelines. He engaged in prospecting in the Arctic Circle before completing his degree in industrial engineering at the University of North Dakota in 1956. He developed an early interest in flight, obtaining a license at the age of fifteen (having misrepresented his age). This allowed him to fly a plane to the academy at age 15, while cars were banned except for those aged 18. In Albuquerque, New Mexico, he entered the mining industry, acquiring his own company, Ranchers Exploration and Development Corporation, before he was thirty. His career was marked by innovations in extraction technologies, delivery systems, and administrative practices. For his work, Anderson was inducted into the National Mining Hall of Fame. Ballooning Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson, and Larry Newman of the Double Eagle II Along with his friend Ben Abruzzo, he became interested in hot air ballooning. The two decided to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Charles Lindbergh's flight, and engaged balloonist Ed Yost (whose transatlantic bid had failed in 1976) to build the Double Eagle. The balloon was launched near Marshfield, Massachusetts on September 9, 1977, but the flight was aborted off the coast of Iceland on September 13. In 1978 Larry Newman, a manufacturer of hang gliders, was added to the crew for the next attempt in the Double Eagle II. This venture was launched August 11 at Presque Isle, Maine, and arrived at Miserey, France, on August 17. For their efforts, the team was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1979. It was both a distance record (3108 miles) and a duration record (137 hours) for the sport. With his son Kristian, he made the first non-stop trans-North American balloon flight. The Kitty Hawk departed Fort Baker, California, on May 8, 1980, and landed on May 12 at Sainte-F√©licit√©, Quebec. Anderson attempted to complete a circumnavigation of the globe by balloon. With Don Ida he launched the balloon Jules Verne from Luxor, Egypt on January 11, 1981, travelling , and landing in Hansa, India 48 hours later.http://www.didyouknow.cd/aroundtheworld/balloons.htm Death Anderson was killed on June 27, 1983, near Bad Kissingen, West Germany. He was in the air with co-pilot Don Ida. Having no wish to stray across the border into East Germany or Czechoslovakia, he attempted to release the gondola from the envelope at touchdown. The bolts failed to fire, and a gust re-lofted the vehicle, whereupon the explosive bolts deployed, and both Anderson and Ida were killed in the fall. The locale of the accident is also given as \\"near the village of Sch√∂nderling in the county of Bad Kissingen\\" in a history of the Gordon Bennett Cup balloon race, in which they were participating as non- competitors at the time. Legacy In 1973, Anderson founded the Anderson Valley Vineyards with his wife Patty. \\"We have a lot of balloon-themed wines and items,\\" wine expert Angela Le Quieu says. She adds that the label for the winery's Balloon Blush wine always uses a picture from the previous year's Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. Creating a foundation, the Abruzzo and Anderson families partnered with the City of Albuquerque and constructed the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum next to the launch field of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.

Following a coup d'√©tat, in which the pro-Western king Narai was replaced by Phetracha, Siamese troops besieged the French fortress in Bangkok for four months. The Siamese were able to muster about 40,000 troops, equipped with cannon, against the entrenched 200 French troops, but the military confrontation proved inconclusive. Tensions between the two belligerents progressively subsided, and finally a negotiated settlement was reached allowing the French to leave the country.Siam: An Account of the Country and the People, Peter Anthony Thompson, 1910 p.28 The Siege of Bangkok would mark the end of French military presence in Siam, as France was soon embroiled in the major European conflicts of the War of the League of Augsburg (1688‚Äì1697), and then the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1713/1714). With the end of the siege, a long period started during which Siam would remain suspicious of Western intervention. Only a few French missionaries were allowed to remain, while trade continued on a limited level with other European countries such as Portugal, the Dutch Republic and England. Background King Narai had sought to expand relations with the French, as a counterweight to Portuguese and Dutch influence in his kingdom, and at the suggestion of his Greek councilor Constantine Phaulkon.Smithies 2002, p.9-10 Numerous embassies were exchanged in both directions, including the embassy of Chevalier de Chaumont to Siam in 1685 Martin, p.25 and the embassy of Kosa Pan to France in 1686. French soldiers in Siam, 17th century Siamese painting. This led to a major dispatch of French ambassadors and troops to Siam in 1687,Smithies 2002, p.10 organized by the Marquis de Seignelay. The embassy consisted of a French expeditionary force of 1,361 soldiers, missionaries, envoys and crews aboard five warships. The military wing was led by General Desfarges, and the diplomatic mission by Simon de la Loub√®re and Claude C√©beret du Boullay, a director of the French East India Company. Desfarges had instructions to negotiate the establishment of troops in Mergui and Bangkok (considered as \\"the key to the kingdom\\") rather than the southern Songkla, and to take these locations if necessary by force. King Narai agreed to the proposal, and a fortress was established in each of the two cities, which were commanded by French governors.Note 6, Smithies 2002, p.99Dhiravat na Prombejra, in Reid p.251-252 Desfarges noted in his account of the eventsAccount of the revolutions which occurred in Siam in the year 1688 by General Desfarges, translated by Smithies, Michael (2002) Three military accounts of the 1688 \\"Revolution\\" in Siam. that he was in command of the fortress of Bangkok, with 200 French officers and men,Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.25 as well as a Siamese contingent provided by King Narai, and Du Bruant was in command of Mergui with 90 French soldiers.De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p.76 Another 35 soldiers with three or four French officers were assigned to ships of the King of Siam, with a mission to fight piracy. The disembarkment of French troops in Bangkok and Mergui led to strong nationalist movements in Siam directed by the Mandarin and Commander of the Elephant Corps, Phra Phetracha. By 1688 anti-foreign sentiments, mainly directed at the French and Phaulkon, were reaching their zenith. The Siamese courtiers resented the dominance of the Greek Phaulkon in state affairs, along with his Japanese wife Maria Guyomar de Pinha and European lifestyle, whilst the Buddhist clergy were uneasy with the increasing prominence of the French Jesuits. The Siamese mandarinate under the leadership of Phetracha complained about the occupation force and increasingly opposed Phaulkon. Siege of the French fortress in Bangkok by the Siamese revolutionary forces of Phetracha in 1688. Matters were brought to a head when King Narai fell gravely ill in March 1688. Phetracha initiated the Siamese revolution of 1688 by seizing the Royal Palace in Lopburi and putting king Narai under house-arrest on 17‚Äì18 May. He also imprisoned Constantine Phaulkon on 18 May 1688,Smithies 2002, p.11 and executed the king's adopted son Mom Pi on May 20.Smithies 2002, p.184 =General Desfarges in Lopburi= On 2 June, General Desfarges, commander of the Bangkok fortress, was invited to Lopburi by Phetracha, and according to the account of one of his officers named De la ToucheRelation of what occurred in the kingdom of Siam in 1688 by De la Touche, translated in Smithies, Michael (2002), Three military accounts of the 1688 \\"Revolution\\" in Siam received promises of significant personal gains, such as the naming of his eldest son, Marquis Desfarges, to a major position in the Siamese government, equivalent to that which Constantine Phaulkon had held.De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p.68 Phetracha also required Desfarges to move his troops from Bangkok to Lopburi in order to contribute in an ongoing war with the Lao and the Cochin-Chinese.De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p.69 Desfarges managed to leave by promising that he would send the troops demanded by Phetracha, and that he would remit the fortress of Bangkok. He also had to leave his two sons as hostages to Phetracha. Desfarges left Lopburi on 5 June. As Desfarges had shown no interest in the fate of Phaulkon, Phetracha ordered Phaulkon's execution the same day.Smithies 2002, p.18 Phaulkon, who had been submitted to many tortures since his arrest, was beheaded by Phetracha's own son, Ok-Phra Sorasak.Vollant de Verquains, in Smithies 2002, p.134 Desfarges returned to Bangkok on 6 June accompanied by two mandarins, including Kosa Pan, the former ambassador to France, to whom he was supposed to remit the fortress. According to Vollant de Verquains, on that same day, in a council of war with his officers, the decision was taken not to obey Phetracha, but rather to resist him and start an armed confrontation.Vollant de Verquains, Smithies 2002, p.137 =Start of the hostilities= Phetracha moved to besiege the French fortress in Bangkok with 40,000 men,De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p.66 and over a hundred cannons.De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p.70 The Siamese troops apparently received Dutch support in their fight against the French, and the Dutch factor Johan Keyts was accused of collaborating with the Siamese.Smithies, p.93 The French had two fortresses (one in Bangkok, one in Thonburi on the other side of the Chao Phraya river) and 200 men, including officers. General Desfarges was commander-in-chief, and Mr de Vertesalle was second in command.Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.37 For food, they also had about 100 cows, which Constance Phaulkon had had the foresight of providing them, which they started to slaughter. In order to facilitate defensive work, they also burnt down the small village which was near the Bangkok fortress.Desfarges, in Smithies, p.41 The first act of war was the attack on a Chinese junk belonging to the king of Siam, which was passing by. The captain of the junk had refused to give supplies to French, especially the salt which was needed to salt meat, and therefore was fired on repeatedly.Vollant de Verquains, Smithies 2002, p.137-138 =Thonburi fortress= The fortress in Thonburi, on the right (western) side of the Chao Phraya, in front of the Bangkok fortress. The French initially occupied both sides of the Chao Phraya in Bangkok, with two fortresses, one on the left bank (the Bangkok fortress) and one on the right bank (the Thonburi fortress). Seeing that the position would be difficult to defend, especially since communications would become nearly impossible at low tide, the French decided to regroup in the larger fortress, on the left bank of the river. The French destroyed parts of the fortifications, split 18 cannons and spiked the rest. Soon after they left the smaller fort, Siamese troops invested it and began to set up cannons and mortars to bombard the French positions. Forty cannons were set up there, which were in a very good position to shoot at the French fortress on the other side of the river. As the Siamese were using the Thonburi fortress advantageously, the French decided to launch an attack against it and destroy it. A detachment of 30 men was sent, on two longboats led by an ensign. The French were overwhelmed by the Siamese forces, however, and although several had managed to scale the ramparts, they soon had to jump from it. Four French soldiers were killed on the spot, and four later died from their wounds.Vollant des Verquains, in Smithies 2002, p.139 =Siamese encirclement of the Bangkok fortress= The Chao Phraya, from Bangkok (left) to the sea (right), was lined with forts and blocked with barrages. The Siamese then endeavored to confine the French troops in the Bangkok fortress, by building redoubts. Twelve small forts were constructed around the French fortress, each one containing between seven and ten cannons. According to the French, this was done with the help of the Dutch.Vollant des Verquains, in Smithies 2002, p.70 The Chao Praya, connecting the fortress of Bangkok to the sea, was lined with numerous forts, and was blocked at its mouth with five to six rows of huge tree trunks, an iron chain and numerous embarkations.Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.52 Altogether, there were seven batteries, containing 180 cannons.Vollant des Verquains, in Smithies 2002, p.140 Since two ships of the king of Siam were out at sea being commanded by some of his officers, Desfarges sent a longboat to try to reach them, and possibly call the French in India (Pondicherry) for help.De la Touche, in Smithies 2002, p.71 The longboat was commanded by a company lieutenant and ship ensign, Sieur de Saint-Christ. He was blocked on his way to the sea, however, as numerous fortifications and Siamese soldiers had been established there. Overwhelmed, Saint-Christ self-exploded his own ship, leading to the death of hundreds of Siamese and most of the French crew except two, who were ultimately remitted to Desfarges. =De-escalation and peace= In an effort to end the stalemate with the French in Bangkok, on 24 June Phetracha released the two sons of Desfarges, whom he had been holding as hostages since the visit of General Desfarges to Lopburi in early June, as well as all other French prisoners.Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.48 Although he tried to make peace with the French, Phetracha managed to eliminate all the viable candidates to the throne: the two brothers of the king were executed on 9 July 1688.Smithies 2002, p.184Dhiravat na Prombejra, in Reid p.252 King Narai himself died on July 11, possibly with the help of poisoning.Vollant des Verquains, in Smithies 2002, p.145 Phetracha was crowned king on 1 August 1688, in Ayutthaya. He founded the new Ban Phlu Luang dynasty. After that time, the tension around the French in Bangkok subsided, with fewer cannon shots being traded, and exchanges of food and services being resumed to a certain level. Some discussions were also cautiously started to find an agreement. On 9 September the French warship Oriflamme, carrying 200 troops and commanded by de l'Estrilles, arrived at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River, but was unable to dock at the Bangkok fortress as the entrance to the river was being blocked by the Siamese.Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.49 According to Vollant des Verquains, this put further pressure on the Siamese however to find a peaceful way out of the conflict.Vollant des Verquains, in Smithies 2002, p.148 Desfarges finally negotiated in the end of September 1688 an agreement to leave the country with his men on board the Oriflamme and two Siamese ships, the Siam and the Louvo, provided by Phetracha.Smithies 2002, p.73 The new king Phetracha gave back all his French prisoners. To guarantee the agreement, the French were supposed to leave the country holding two Siamese hostages, while three French hostages were supposed to remain in Siam until the Siamese ships were returned: Mgr Laneau, Bishop of Metellopolis, V√©ret, the head of the French factory in Siam, and Chevalier Desfarges, the younger son of General Desfarges.Smithies 2002, p.12 =Maria Guyomar de Pinha= Ruins of the residence of Constantine Phaulkon and his wife Maria Guyomar de Pinha in Lopburi, Thailand. Phaulkon's Catholic Japanese-Portuguese wife, named Maria Guyomar de Pinha,Note 9, Smithies 2002, p.100 who had been promised protection by being ennobled a countess of France, took refuge with the French troops in Bangkok, where she was able to stay from October 4-18, 1688. She had managed to flee Ayutthaya with the help of a French officer named Sieur de Sainte- Marie. According to Desfarges himself, Phetracha demanded her return, threatening to \\"abolish the vestiges of the (Christian) religion\\", and he further captured dozens of French people to obtain her return: the Jesuit Father de La Breuille, 10 missionaries, fourteen officers and soldiers, six members of the French East India Company, and fourteen other French people (including three ship captains, three mirror technicians, Sieur de Billy, governor of Phuket, a carpenter named Lapie, and the musician Delaunay).Desfarges, in Smithies 2002, p.50 Desfarges, afraid of compromising the peace agreement and resuming a full conflict, returned her to the Siamese on 18 October, against the opinion of his officers.Smithies 2002, p.184 Despite the promises that had been made regarding her safety, she was condemned to slavery in the kitchens of Phetracha, which remained in effect until Phetracha died in 1703.Smithies 2002, p.11-12 =Retreat from Bangkok= Desfarges finally left with his men to Pondicherry on 13 November, on board the Oriflamme and two Siamese ships, the Siam and the Louvo, provided by Phetracha.De la Touche in Smithies 2002, p.73 Altogether, the siege had lasted more than four months, until the negotiated settlement was reached.Martin, p. 26Black, p.106 Of the three French hostages who were supposed to remain in Siam until the Siamese ships were returned, only Mgr Laneau, Bishop of Metellopolis, actually remained, while V√©ret, the head of the French factory, and the Chevalier Desfarges, son of the General, managed to flee on board the Oriflamme. The Siamese, angered by the non-respect of the agreement, seized some of the French baggage, about 17 remaining French soldiers, and put Mgr Laneau in prison for several years. On 14 November, the day following the departure of the French, the 1644 Treaty and Alliance of Peace between Siam and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was renewed, guaranteeing the Dutch the deerskin export monopoly they had had, and giving them freedom to trade freely in Siamese ports with anyone. They also obtained a renewal of their export monopoly on Ligor for tin (originally granted by king Narai in 1671).Dhivarat na Pombejra in Reid, p.265 The Dutch, and to lesser extent the English, continued to trade in Ayutthaya, although with difficulty.Smithies 2002, p.181 Aftermath Once arrived in the small French settlement of Pondicherry, some of the French troops remained to bolster the French presence there, but most left for France on February 16, 1689 aboard the French Navy Normande and the French Company Coche, with the engineer Vollant des Verquains and the Jesuit Le Blanc aboard.Smithies, p.89 The two ships were captured by the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope, however, because the War of the Augsburg League had started. After a month in the Cape, the prisoners were sent to Zeeland where they were kept at the prison of Middelburg. They were able to return to France through a general exchange of prisoners.Note 1, Smithies 2002, p.19 On April 10, 1689, Desfarges - who had remained in Pondicherry - led an expedition to capture the tin-producing island of Phuket in an attempt to restore some sort of French control in Siam.Hall, p.350 The island was captured temporarily in 1689,Dhivarat na Prombejra, in Reid p.266 but the occupation led nowhere, and Desfarges returned to Pondicherry in January 1690.Smithies 2002, p.185 Recalled to France, he left 108 troops in Pondicherry to bolster defenses, and left with his remaining troops on the Oriflamme and the Company ships Lonr√© and Saint-Nicholas on February 21, 1690.Smithies 2002, p.179 Desfarges died on his way back trying to reach Martinique, and the Oriflamme later sank on February 27, 1691, with most of the remaining French troops, off the coast of Britanny.Smithies 2002, p.16/p.185 France was unable to stage any comeback or organize a retaliation due to its involvement in major European conflicts: the War of the League of Augsburg (1688‚Äì1697), and then the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1713/1714).Dhiravat na Pombejra, in Reid, p.267 France only resumed official contacts in 1856, when Napoleon III sent an embassy to King Mongkut led by Charles de Montigny.\\"Threats to National Independence : 1886 - 1896\\" , Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Retrieved on 2008-08-26.

History In 1978, Bobby C. Scott, a self-taught botanist, recognized some plants in a section of woods in Garland, Texas as indicators of virgin forest. The existence of virgin forest within city limits is highly unusual, as the 19th Century settlers in the area typically cut down the forests for use in construction or to clear land for farming. For the next decade, Mr. Scott fought for the preservation of this area, known as the Spring Creek Forest, named for the primary creek running through it. He and Dallas naturalist Edward C. \\"Ned\\" Fritz worked together to present a case to the City of Garland and Dallas County for preservation. The pair brought in academic and government botanists, who confirmed the unique nature of the Forest, and identified several rare and unique plants. In 1988, Dallas County and the State of Texas purchased of the land to set aside as the Spring Creek Forest Preserve. The land was given to Garland for maintenance. Since 1987, the City of Garland and the Preservation Society for Spring Creek Forest are responsible for maintaining the nature trails within the Preserve.http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/city/garland/stories/DN- garfocus_01eas.ART0.West.Edition1.4442b79.html Group enjoys nature at arm's length.

Preservation Society for Spring Creek Forest.https://www.thegarlandnews.com/rec.cfm?article=7325 Garland's wildlife, nature preserve. The Garland News. 2008 July 18. Landscape The preserve is situated in northern Dallas County, and features old-growth bottomland forest with a gentle, wide spring water stream that flows over a bed of solid limestone. The force of the water has cut cliffs from the surrounding Austin Chalk. The towering 20- to 40-foot-tall () cliffs contain Cretaceous fossils dated at 87 million years old, a combination primarily found only in Garland. Austin Chalk is also found in the eastern portion of the DFW Metroplex heading toward the Texas Hill Country. Several geologic formations are interspersed along the last five miles (8 km) of the creek located in Garland and Richardson. The entire length of the creek, named Spring Creek, is spring fed at a constant 72¬∞F (22¬∞C). The swift water of Spring Creek varies in depth between one and six feet (0.3 meter - 2 meter) and is about 20 feet (7 meters) wide. Even in years of extreme drought, . The water clarity allows one to watch the native Longear Sunfish, which can be seen gliding along against the white, limestone bottom. The abundant water supply has allowed the forest to survive for centuries. Some of the trees in the forest are as much as 500 years old and tower 100 feet (33 meters) on trunks that are 4 feet (1.1 meters) in diameter. Five varieties of oak live in the forest, including chinquapin, bur, and shumard, a combination found nowhere else in the world. Native plants include the solomon's seal, horsetails and pennsylvania violet (Viola pennsylvanicum). More than 630 species of plants and animals have been observed in addition to the many species of dragonflies, spiders, mites, beetles, fungi, and ants living in the forest. Preservation The densely shaded preserve has been improved with miles of earthen trail and a short quarter mile section of concrete trail leading from the paved parking lot to the water's edge. The land won preservation status due to its unique old growth trees and endangered species. The preserve website contains thousands of photographs of the landscape, flowers, wildlife and water. In keeping with the goals of the preservation society, the forest is kept as natural as possible so that visitors can step back in time and experience life as it was before the area was settled by the Peter's Colony in 1846. Every February, nature walks are held by the society to celebrate the blooming of the trout lily (dogtooth-violet), a wildflower that is considered the harbinger of Spring for locals. The annual walks attract about 30 to 50 outdoors people each year. While this pristine, clear water creek runs through the solid limestone of three cities, only two parcels of land abutting the creek have been given preservation status. These are the Spring Creek Forest Preserve, owned by the city of Garland; and the Dallas County Park Preserve, owned by Dallas County Parks and Open Spaces. Both preserves are across the street from each other on Holford Road. The majority of Spring Creek has been land locked by private housing developments and commercial office buildings along its entire ten-mile length for decades. These two parks are all that is left of the land once inhabited by tribes of the Caddo nation. The total preservation area contains two sections. The Lee F. Jackson Spring Creek Forest Preserve, where official tours are held at 1770 Holford Rd., contains approximately . The Dallas County Park Preserve located on the opposite side of the bridge at 1787 Holford Rd., contains . The Preserve is maintained and managed by the Spring Creek Forest Preservation Society a not-for-profit organization formed in 1987 to oversee the park under the direction of the Garland Parks and Recreation Department as provided under its contract with Dallas County. The all volunteer Society holds monthly meetings from September through May with a monthly volunteer work day held on Saturdays. For times and locations of the meetings, please see the organization calendar at The land was originally purchased from private land owners through a Dallas County Bond Election. The primary land owner was Ann C. Weary, who sketched the trees in intricate detail. Future Today, there exists a great quantity of undeveloped acreage, which could be preserved, on both publicly and privately owned land. Due to the , current private landowners will most likely sell their land to commercial developers. The city has allocated toward the construction of playgrounds and soccer fields, some built directly along the banks of the stream. The destruction of this area began to escalate with the completion of the 190 Bush Tollway, which passes directly over Spring Creek. Official development of the area has been in the active planning stages for at least the last decade. The most recent major projects have been the completion of the nearby Firewheel Golf Course and the newly developed Firewheel Town Center, a.k.a., shopping mall. The area is slated to become a major tourist attraction for corporate travelers due to its proximity to Richardson's Telecom Corridor. The middle waters of Spring Creek flow in the shadows of the Owen's Sausage farm/processing plant and several computer technology skyscrapers. Walmart and Sam's Club were built within hundreds of feet of the preserve with little protest from the citizenry. The headwaters literally flow under Collin Creek Mall in Plano. As with any major commercial development, the value of the few remaining parcels along Spring Creek have begun to skyrocket. City officials admit that the city is now officially landlocked since it is also surrounded on all sides by other suburbs. This means that the remaining ecologically sensitive area located on private lands is in danger of developmental destruction. The only way for the remaining natural limestone outcroppings, dramatic elevations and large colonies of Trout Lilies to be preserved, is for a philanthropist to come forward and purchase land for preservation. While it was hoped by many citizens for many years that the county would purchase the land, or in the least that the city Planning and Zoning Commission would only approve environmentally related businesses, it is now apparent .

The Regiment was yet again renamed as the 1st Regiment of Madras Lancers in 1886, and was known by that title till the turn of the century, when it was changed to 1st Madras Lancers. In 1903 it was renamed as the 26th Light Cavalry and three years later it became the Prince of Wales Own Light Cavalry and then in 1910, it became the 26th King George‚Äôs Own Light Cavalry. During this time it participated in the Third Mysore War, 1789‚Äì1792, the Fourth Mysore War, 1793-1798. Campaigns against Dhoondia Wagh and the Polygars, 1799-1830. Campaigns in Afghanistan and Burma, between, 1880-1914. Madras Cavalry =World War I= The 26th King George‚Äôs Own Light Cavalry served in the South Yemen during World War I as part of the Aden Field Force, I: 30th Lancers (Gordon's Horse) The year 1826 witnessed the birth of another illustrious regiment, the 4th Nizam‚Äôs Cavalry, raised as part of the Hyderabad Cavalry. It later re-christened as the 30th Lancers and also came to be known as Gordon‚Äôs Horse after Sir John Gordon. This regiment participated in the Indian Mutiny, 1857‚Äì1859 and the Second Burmese War, 1860-1889. From the Second Burmese War to World War I, 1889-1914.

Givenchy 1914; France and Flanders 1914-1916; Afghanistan 1919; Iraq 1920. =World War I= During the first world war the Regiment was part of the 3rd (Ambala) Cavalry Brigade, 1st Indian Cavalry Division they were brigaded with the 8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars and the 9th Hodson's Horse They were sent to France for service on the Western Front where they at times would serve in the trenches as infantry due to the difference on troop levels each Cavalry Brigade once dismounted formed a dismounted regiment. The high number of officer casualties suffered early on had an effect on its later performance. British officers that understood the language, customs, and psychology of their men could not be quickly replaced, and the alien environment of the Western Front had some effect on the soldiers.Haythornthwaite P.J. (1992). The World War One Sourcebook, Arms and Armour Press. The Regiment stayed in France as part of the 1st Indian Cavalry Division until March 1918 when the division was broken up and reformed in Egypt. Amalgamation In 1922, the two regiments were amalgamated to form the 8th King George‚Äôs Own Light Cavalry, inheriting in the process, the traditions and rich heritages of two cultures. After India attained independence, the regiment was renamed as the 8th Light Cavalry. The 1st Regiment Madras Native Cavalry, in its infancy, saw action in Burma and Afghanistan, where it earned the Battle Honours AVA and AFGHANISTAN, indicative of its magnificent performance in both these theatres of war. Then came the Great War and the 26th King George‚Äôs Own Light Cavalry was moved to South Yemen as part of the Aden Field Force, where, keeping in the traditions of the regiment, it performed brilliantly. During this war, 30th Lancers saw action in France where, though being a cavalry regiment, it received a good taste of trench warfare. It then went on to extinguish the embers of an Arab rebellion in Iraq, before going into action in Persia. By this time, the regiment had earned 12 Battle Honours. With a meritorious history of over a century, it became befitting for King George ‚Äì V, Colonel of one of the regiments to become the Colonel-in-Chief of the amalgamated regiment. Field Marshal, Lord Chetwode became the first Colonel of the Regiment in 1936. It is Lord Chetwode‚Äôs immortal shibboleth ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe safety, honour and welfare of your country come first, always and every time. The honour, welfare and comfort of the men you command come next. Our own ease, comfort and safety come last, always and every time‚Äù, which became the credo not only for the regiment, but for the entire officer corps of the Indian Army and is etched in main hall of the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun. World War II World War II 1939-1945; Waziristan 1939-1943; Vizagapatam 1944; Burma 1945, 19th Indian Division, 1946. In 1940, the Regiment bid farewell to the horses and began the long and arduous process of mechanisation. It was fully mechanised by 1943 on armoured cars. It executed its first mechanised operation in 1945 in Burma, where it earned 19 gallantry and distinguished service awards in this single operation Post Indian Independence Post independence, the regiment had the privilege of participating in all major wars fought by the Indian Army ‚Äì Hyderabad (1948), Jammu and Kashmir (1949), Goa (1961), China (Sikkim) (1962), Pakistan (Punjab) (1965) and Pakistan (Jammu and Kashmir) (1971). The operations in Hyderabad had just been over, when the regiment was moved to Jammu and Kashmir. During the Liberation of Goa in 1961, the regiment spearheaded the attack which led the Portuguese to surrender. The history of mechanized warfare was re-written by the regiment in 1962, when it drove its tanks to the dizzying heights of 14,000 feet up the Nathu La pass road in Sikkim ‚Äì a feat never performed or attempted before anywhere in the world. Khemkaran in Punjab witness the regiment in tank-versus-tank encounters with Pakistani forces resulting in the battlefield become a ‚Äúgraveyard‚Äù for Pakistani Patton tanks. Here the regiment earned the Battle Honour PUNJAB. The 1971 Indo-Pak war saw the regiment among the Indian forces which had wrung the tactically fragile Chicken‚Äôs Neck in the Akhnoor Sector. The Regiment‚Äôs crowning glory came in 1976, when in recognition of its services and valour, the regiment was presented the Guidon by the then President, Mr Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. The regiment is the third oldest armoured regiment in India and is amongst the most highly decorated regiments in the country. It will commemorate its 225th Raising Day on 23rd Oct 2012.

Originally constituted around the Walibi amusement park located in Wavre in Belgium, it quickly developed and Walibi has become the name of several parks in Europe. The group was bought three times between 1998 and 2006 to end up in the fold of the leisure parks division of Compagnie des Alpes alongside Parc Ast√©rix and the Gr√©vin Museums. The Walibi parks used to be owned by an independent company, run by Belgian Eddy Meeus. They were then sold off to American company Six Flags; however, due to financial problems, they were sold again to Compagnie des Alpes.

The academy opened in 2010 and is supported by the Worshipful Company of Skinners, a London Livery Company. There are currently approximately 900 pupils on roll from Year 7 - Year 11 and over 100 Sixth Form students. More than 60% of the pupils speak English as an additional language and more than 86% of students are from ethnic minority backgrounds. In March 2017 the academy welcomed a short Ofsted inspection which resulted in the academy retaining its recognition as a 'Good' school. History =The Skinners' Company= The Worshipful Company of Skinners (known as The Skinners' Company) is one of the ‚ÄúGreat Twelve‚Äù Livery Companies with a history going back some 700 years. It is one of the most ancient of the City Guilds and developed from the medieval trade guild of the furriers. Members of the guild dressed and traded furs that were used for trimming and lining the garments of richer members of society. The company, as the guild is now called, is no longer associated with the craft but continues to contribute to educating the young and helping the older in need, through their almshouses, charities and schools. The Skinners' Company's School for Girls is the fourth school that was opened by the Skinners' Company. The other schools respectively are the Sir Andrew Judd's free school (now called Tonbridge School), The Skinners' School and Sir Andrew Judd's Commercial School (now called The Judd School).Skinners Company - History = The Skinners' Company's School for Girls = The site of the original school building (now the Upper School) in Stamford Hill was bought in 1883 for ¬£3261 13s 2d by the Skinners' Company. The building was erected at the cost of ¬£10,969 18s 9d and the school was opened, as a public school, in 1890 in order to meet the demand for girls' education in London. Girls started at the age of eight. At that time, the school accommodated 187 girls and 8 teachers. During the Second World War, the school was evacuated to Welwyn Garden City. Despite this, some emergency lessons were held at the school. The school was also used to house a division of the emergency fire service. The girls also adopted a warship, sending food and clothing for its sailors. The introduction of the Education Act 1944 led to the school becoming a state grammar school. Fees were abolished and entry was gained through the 11-plus examination. In 1972, Mount Pleasant County secondary school merged with The Skinners' Company's School for Girls, with the male students transferring to Brooke House school and the female students joining the existing grammar school. From 1972 onwards, the school became London's first voluntary aided comprehensive school and it operated on two sites: the Upper School in Stamford Hill and the Lower School in Mount Pleasant. In 2003, the school's growing Sixth Form formed a consortium with Our Lady's Convent RC High School which it had worked with throughout the 1980s. In 2006, Stoke Newington School also joined the Sixth Form consortium which expanded upon the curriculum of the existing Sixth Form, which was established in 1927. The school was awarded specialist status in recognition of its Business and Enterprise teaching and became a Business and Enterprise College in 2004. =Skinners' Academy= In 2010, with the sponsorship of The Skinners' Company and the support of Hackney Council and The Hackney Learning Trust, the school reopened as an academy, meeting the demands of the newly regenerated area of Woodberry Down. The school opened as a mixed school accommodating ages 11‚Äì19. =Leadership= To date, Skinners' has had eight Headmistresses (as Skinners' Company School for Girls) and three Principals (as Skinners' Academy). * Mary Hannah Page (1890‚Äì1900) * Emily Newton (1900‚Äì1927) * Lydia Barton (1927‚Äì1952) * Margaret Gray (1952‚Äì1963) * Pamela Edwards (1963‚Äì1984) * Mary Ludlow (1984‚Äì1997) * Jenny Wilkins (1997-2009) * Jan Balogh (2009-2010) * Jenny Wilkins(2010-2013) Skinners' Academy * Tim Clark (2013‚Äì2019) Skinners' Academy * John Beighton (2019-Present) Skinners' Academy School buildings and grounds The lower school site consists of one building. The upper school site consists of a range of buildings built at various stages of the school history. Each serve a range of departments: *The main building (upper school) was the only building of the school when it opened in 1890. It contains administrative offices including school reception, Head and Deputy Head offices and a staff room. It also houses a library, assembly hall, canteen, and classrooms that service various departments and laboratories. This building was extended in 1893, when the gym was built and again in the 1960s when the current ICT classrooms were built. *The Art Block was built in 1964 and later extended. It contains dedicated rooms for Art, the Sixth Form facilities and facilities for those with special educational needs. *The Business Huts were built to accommodate the school's specialist business and ICT facilities. *The Science/Technology block is the newest building on the school grounds, built in 1994. This provides dedicated resources for the teaching of Science and Design and Technology. In order to achieve the school's aim of sustainability, fruit and vegetables are grown on school grounds for use in the canteen. At the upper school site there is a rowan tree, which was given to the school by the Skinners' School Old Girls Association. The rowan tree recognises the school's origins with the Skinners' Company, as rowan berries were used for tanning leather. School uniform Since the school's opening in 1890, the uniform has undergone great change. The uniform currently consists of a white dress shirt, a green/red tie (depending what year you're in), a green and grey blazer, lanyard, a green and grey jumper (optional), grey skirt/trousers, smart black shoes and a skinners rucksack/shoulder bag. Present and future plans The school currently operates on a split site basis, with years 7-9 in the lower school and years 10-13 in the upper school. However, due to the inefficiency and the limitations caused thereof, plans have been made to relocate the school as an academy to a single site at Woodberry Down, under the Woodberry Down Regeneration project in 2010.Masterplan In order to prepare for the transition of sites, in the academic year of 2006‚Äì2007 the school took its final cohort of year 7s. In the academic year of 2008‚Äì2009, the lower school site shall be closed and the then years 9-13 shall be accommodated in the upper school. To adapt to these changes some innovative teaching and curriculum practices will be adopted, including vertical tutoring. Academics and curriculum The academic curriculum in the years leading to GCSE reflects the National Curriculum in its breadth and balance. The school offers a range of vocational and academic subjects at GCSE and A- Level, most notably in business studies. Of the 127 pupils eligible for GCSEs in 2007, 24.4% had special educational needs. In 2007, 28% of students achieved 5 or more A*-C Grades, including maths and English.BBC NEWS  Education  League Tables  Secondary schools in Hackney Student leadership =Head Boy and Head Girl= Each year, a year 12 student is elected as head girl and head boy. Their main duties encompass representing the school and the student body at various meetings and events. They also makes a speech at each year's prize giving ceremony at the school. Skinners' first Head Boy and Head Girl, Denzel Asiedu-buoh and Esin Akdogan were elected in 2016. =School Council= The school has an elected school council, consisting of one representative from each form class and the elected head boy and girl. The school council meet on a regular basis and work together to initiate change within the school and ensure the recognition of the student voice. The school council has been commended by Ofsted as having ‚ÄúPupils [who] are articulate and confident. The school council is actively involved in improving life at the school.‚Äù =Prefects= Prefects from year 10 are selected by the headmaster and are given various responsibilities within the school. These include lunch time monitoring, recycling duty, and the completing of the progress book, which documents a class's behaviour. Prefects are given red badges to wear within school. =The Future= As a part of the school's transition into an academy and the school's aim of promoting the student voice, current year 8 pupils, who will be year 11s at the point of transition, have been given the opportunity to design a new sustainable building, in keeping within the Woodberry Down Masterplan. Extracurricular The school hosts a variety of clubs. At present the school is part of the Urban Scholars Intervention Programme hosted at the City of London School for Girls, which supports a number of gifted and talented students, through a rigorous and challenging programme of activities.Urban Scholars' Intervention Programme The school also works in collaboration with NFTE and last year, a group of five students won a nationwide competition for their business ‚ÄòHennoo', their prize included a trip to New York.Welcome :: Enterprise Education Trust (NFTE) The school has strong links with a number of successful businesses and companies working within the City of London, these include Linklaters, UBS, Commerz Bank, Hewlett-Packard, HSBC, and The Skinners' Company. The school has a successful choir and steel pan club and they've performed at the Skinners' Hall and other venues.The Skinners' Company ‚Äì Education ‚Äì The Skinners' Company's School for Girls Each year, Sports Day is held at Finsbury Park and all students and staff participate. In addition to this, there are a number of sporting opportunities available to staff and students. These include: football, tennis, volleyball, badminton, canoeing, and kickboxing. Yoga is also available for teachers. Prize Giving This event was previously known as \\"Speech Day\\", and was held each year at the Upper School. Each November the entire school gathers in the Round Chapel, to celebrate the school and the achievements of the year. The event is attended by the school governors and representatives from the Worshipful Company of Skinners, along with staff and the parents of the girls. The representatives of the Worshipful Company of Skinners dress in lynx fur trimmed robes in order to commemorate the Skinners' Company. Before proceeding to the stage, the beadle of the Skinners' Company knocks his ceremonial staff against the floor twice, indicating the start of the procession. Behind him walks the headmistress, who is followed by a row of school governors and a row of company representatives who bear the silver leopard statue, a symbol of the Worshipful Company of Skinners. Prizes are awarded to individuals who have performed well in their year, along with specific prizes accredited to past headteachers and the SSOGA.News Traditionally, pupils supplement applause by ‚Äòwhooping' when the recipient accepts their award.

Che Why and Supercluster. Biography Hay was born on January 28, 1950, in Grand Rapids, Michigan to a postal worker and housewife. He attended Aquinas College (Grand Rapids) and worked as a school teacher and as a statistician prior to divorcing his first wife and moving to Kennebunkport, Maine. =As musician= Hay was convinced by Ken Starratt to move to Athens, Georgia, from Maine after making a trip to Athens in the late 1970s and surveying the blossoming music scene. Bob met other local musicians including roommate \\"Big\\" Al Walsh, Mig Little and Diana Torell and formed the band the Squalls. They were well known for switching instruments and singing duties during their shows. In 1986, they were featured in the movie Athens, GA: Inside Out. The Squalls underwent various lineup changes after Mig Little left the band. They were joined by Mark Cooper Smith, Juan Molina, Paul Hammond and others at various times during their career. The Squalls made a self-released e.p. and single, as well as two albums for Dog Gone It Records-a label owned by Jefferson Holt, the manager for REM. The Squalls made several trips up and down the East coast of the U.S. and a trip through the mid-West before disbanding. Hay never stopped jamming with his friends and briefly performed with a project called the Yams who learned covers of songs in hopes of playing bars and fraternity parties. This is where he began his association with multi-instrumentalist Bill David, a local musician with deep roots in the community. Bob Hay & the Jolly Beggars began as a solo project. Hay became fascinated with the works of Robert Burns, the 18th century Scottish bard, after a random comment which was made during a jam session. He found songs by Robert Burns at the University of Georgia library and began to learn and arrange them. Other former members of the Squalls, including Ken Starratt's youngest son Gabriel Fricks-Starratt, became interested and joined. They have released 3 CDs and perform sporadically in and around Athens, Georgia. Noogeez was dreamed up by Ken Starratt as a way to use Bob's older Squalls material in a kid-friendly format. 2 videos have been made so far using this material. Members of this band include Ken and Jorma Starratt, Ken's son. Their first video, \\"Kathy\\", won the audience choice award during the 2007 Athfest Sprockets competition. A.

Sometimes he \\"records in the morning\\" and has his work on My Space \\"by the evening.\\" Hay married Vanessa Briscoe, the lead singer for Pylon in 1986 and they have two daughters. She recruited him to play acoustic guitar in her recording project Supercluster. They released an e.p. \\"Special 5\\" in December 2007. Supercluster plan to record additional material in July 2008 and release the whole as a full length work called Waves by the end of 2009.

Operation  The bogie comprises a carrying axle connected to a coupled axle via a shaft or lever. In straight running, any radial movement of the carrying axle results in a sideways movement of the coupled axle in the opposite direction.Adler, Gerhard et al. (1978). Lexicon der Eisenbahn, Berlin: transpress, p. 427. However, the carrying axle is centred by means of two heavy duty springs just behind it. In addition the pivot pin may be allowed to move sideways, but again is held centrally by heavy springs. When travelling round a curve, the carrying axle swings to one side causing the coupled axle to move sideways in the opposite direction. In this way radial forces during curve running are more or less evened out on both axles, so that riding qualities similar to those of a normal bogie are achieved and wear and tear reduced on wheel flanges and rails. The bogie is a type of pony truck and was named after the locomotive firm of Krauss and the engineer, Richard von Helmholtz. By contrast a Bissel bogie is independently installed in the frame, and sideways guidance of the locomotive is achieved by elastic forces. The distribution of these forces is not tightly defined and, in addition, they are dependent on the curve radius. Examples of use =Steam locomotives= Because the advantages of a pony truck come into play particularly on tight curves, the Krauss-Helmholtz bogie initially appeared on branch line, Lokalbahn and narrow gauge locomotives. One of the first locomotives of this type was the Bavarian D VIII. On this tank locomotive the bogie was located at the rear; however in the majority of cases it was at the front or - if the locomotive had to have equally good riding qualities in both directions - at both ends. Later this pony truck arrangement was also adopted by the DRG standard locomotives (Einheitslokomotive) of the Deutsche Reichsbahn, e.g. on the ten-coupled classes: 44, 45, 50 and 85. An exception was the Class 84, that was fitted with Schwartzkopff-Eckhardt II bogies or Lutterm√∂ller axle drives. The tender locomotives of classes 41 and 45 only had a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie at the front; the trailing axle was housed in a Bissel bogie. The tank locomotives of Class 85, like some of the Class 64 and 86 engines, had two Krauss-Helmholtz bogies. =Electric locomotives= Even the electric locomotives of Reichsbahn classes E 04, E 17, E 18 and E 19 were fitted with comparable pony trucks, known as AEG frames (AEG-Gestell). Because the axles had external bearings, the lever linkage also had to be on the outside, a characteristic detail of these locomotives. =Italian bogie= In Italy, the Krauss-Helmholtz bogie was improved around 1900 by Giuseppe Zara, a technician of the Rete Adriatica and later of the Ferrovie dello Stato; by modifying the structure, rearranging the weight distribution and allowing the bogie to also move transversally respective to the locomotive's frames, he obtained the Italian bogie (a lighter and somewhat different version was the later Zara bogie). It saw widespread use, being fitted on many Italian steam locomotive classes, like the FS Class 625, FS Class 740 and FS Class 685.

The bay is fed by the Nueces River, forming a natural estuary, which renders it ecologically and economically vital to the surrounding area. It serves as a habitat for the propagation of fish and shellfish, which sustain diverse species of birds and other wildlife. The bay is threatened by pollution from the heavy industry on its southern shore, which prevents oyster farming. Petrochemical production and oil are important to the surrounding economies of the major settlements of Corpus Christi and Portland, found on the eastern shore and connected by the Nueces Bay Causeway at the bay's confluence with Corpus Christi Bay. Agriculture dominates the northern shore, where many plots of land are still owned by the descendants of early settlers. The largely abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this area. To the west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by Rincon Bayou and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta. Just south of the mouth are the remains of the abandoned Nuecestown settlement, which is now included in the Corpus Christi city limits. History Nueces Bay formed around 9,000 years ago, as the sea level rose at the conclusion of the last ice age. The sea level stabilized 6,000 years later, shaping the present-day Nueces Bay. The first human inhabitants were the nomadic Aransas Indians, who settled between the Copano and Baffin Bays about 8,000 years ago, until 1300 CE. In the next century, the Karankawa Indians arrived, and were present when Europeans came ashore. Nueces is Spanish for \\"nuts\\", and refers to the pecan trees that grew along the banks of the Nueces River, noted by Spanish explorer Alonso De Le√≥n in 1689. It is unclear when the name was given to the bay; it was called San Miguel Arc√°ngel by Spanish captain Joaqu√≠n de Orobio y Basterra in 1747, and an 1835 map of Texas identified it as Papelote or \\"wastepaper\\" Bay. It appears to have been first noted on a Spanish map in 1527 as the mouth of the R√≠o Escondido or hidden river, which is believed to be the Nueces. French explorer Ren√© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle sailed into the bay in 1685, mistakenly believing it was the Mississippi River. Spanish colonial governor Jos√© de Escand√≥n planned a villa on the mouth of the Nueces River named Villa de Vedoya. About 50 families were sent to the site in 1749, but they failed to establish a settlement due to a lack of sufficient supplies. Later that century, missionaries discussed the possibility of moving Nuestra Se√±ora del Refugio Mission to the site, but decided against the idea due to conflict with the Lipan Apaches. Germans attempted to settle the same area, but were turned away by the French during the Pastry War in the 1830s. The next decade, a colony for freed slaves was proposed by abolitionist Benjamin Lundy, who had to cancel after the outbreak of the Texas Revolution. Corpus Christi, which was founded as a trading post on the southeastern shore in 1839, is believed to be the first permanent settlement on the bay. It soon grew into a major Texas port with a population of 277,454 at the time of the 2000 census. In 1852, a settlement was finally established at the confluence of the Nueces River and Nueces Bay by Henry Kinney, who also founded Corpus Christi. The community was referred to as \\"the Motts\\" by German and English settlers for nearby tree clusters, but was officially known as Nuecestown. It was raided by Mexican bandits in 1875, but recovered and grew to a population of 200 by 1896. After the railroad passed on the town in 1905, it declined, and is today included in the city limits of Corpus Christi. To the north of the bay, the Coleman-Fulton Pasture Company controlled a large segment of San Patricio County for ranching during the aftermath of the Texas Revolution. David Sinton and later Charles Phelps Taft, whose names are immortalized by the nearby towns of Sinton and Taft, were involved with the company. They sold a plot of land on the northeast of Nueces Bay to George H. Paul, who hired Mexican immigrants to clear the land of mesquite trees and founded a ranching community later named West Portland. The plots of land in this community are still mostly held by the descendants of the original owners. The town of Portland‚Äîon the extreme northeast of the bay‚Äîwas also established from land purchased from the Coleman-Fulton Pasture Company by future State Senator John G. Willacy with help from a New England company. The town steadily grew and reached a population of 14,827 by 2000. To the northwest of the bay, on the Whites Point peninsula, a settlement was established around 1866 by cattledriver Darius Rachal, who had purchased land on the point from the cattle-driving White family. Soon after his purchase, many of the Whites died of yellow fever as an epidemic swept the area and killed 14 people. Rachal used his land to raise cattle, grow cotton, and sell real estate to new settlers. A post office was established at the site in 1892, and was given the name Rosita or \\"little flower\\" after the names \\"White Point\\" and \\"Rachal\\" were rejected by United States Postal Service. After a 1915 gas explosion and two massive hurricanes, including a 1919 storm that killed 26 residents (about 50 were killed in Portland and 47 in Corpus Christi), the post office was closed in 1919, and by the next year, most residents had relocated to Odem. Features Map of Nueces Bay Nueces Bay covers an area of and drains the of the Nueces River basin. It has an average depth of 2.3 ft, and a volume of . The bay is considered the southern extreme of the Texas Coastal Plain, which stretches northeast to Galveston Bay, and is part of the geographic transition from the grasslands of the coastal plain to the dry brush region of South Texas. It forms at the base of the Nueces River, which enters at the southwesternmost point of the bay. North of the Nueces entrance is the extension of Odem Bay, named for the nearby settlement of Odem. This extension includes shallow marsh fed by an extensive system of tidal streams including Rincon Bayou, and is headed by Whites Point to the east. Due south of Whites Point at the mouth of Odem Bay, is an oil field, situated against the backdrop of heavy industry on the shore to the southwest. The southern shore, which continues toward Rincon Point, is slender due to the industrial canal dredged to the south to the Port of Corpus Christi. The mouth of Nueces Bay on Corpus Christi Bay from Rincon Point to Indian Point, is crossed by the mile-long (1.6 km) Nueces Bay Causeway, which leads to Portland. West Portland is found on the shoreline of the bay as it curves north and west, which is lined with piers and residences. The bay leads back west to Whites Point on the north shore, which is largely used for agriculture. Ecosystem The Nueces estuary provides an ecosystem for a wide variety of wildlife. However, since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder, and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival. A diverse collection of birds sustained by the water life, such as the black skimmer, brown pelican, great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, roseate spoonbill, tern, and white ibis, can be found in the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks, and white-tailed deer. Industry A great egret wades on the waters of Nueces Bay, with industry on the horizon. Oil has been pumped from the bay since 1912, but fishing has been a mainstay since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $17 million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500 mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc is believed to have been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000 mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700 mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz Power Group. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects. Several oil spills have occurred as a result of the heavy petroleum industry on the south shore of Nueces Bay. In 1984, about of oil leaked from a broken pipeline, which blackened of the shore. Ten years later, Koch Industries, which owns a refinery on the bay, was responsible for a major spill that resulted in the release of of oil, leaving a slick that seeped into Corpus Christi Bay. The Environmental Protection Agency fined the company $30 million for the spill in 2000, and $2.5 million were later given by the company to the state of Texas to improve the bay's water quality.

The movement performed is plantar flexion, a.k.a. ankle extension. Bent-knee Calf raises are sometimes done with a flexed knee, usually roughly 90 degrees. This lessens the stretch in the gastrocnemius (a knee flexor), so the movement is done to emphasize the soleus. =Seated= Seated calf raise Bent-knee calf raises are frequently done in a seated position for comfort. Since the weight of the upper body is rested on the seat, resistance is frequently added. Using bodyweight, one leg could be draped across the other (through external rotation) to exercise unilaterally and double the weight lifted. It can also be executed by using a weight, such as a barbell, to provide resistance to the action of the calf muscles. The exercise is performed from a seated position while the weight rests on the upper leg, just above the knee. The person engaged in this exercise lifts the weight by pushing down on the balls of the feet. Due to the discomfort of higher weights on a bar, barbells used for seated calf raises are frequently padded or wrapped in a towel. There are also seated calf raise machines designed using levers that have pads built into them to protect the patella, quadriceps and tendons. =Bridging= Bridging exercises are done with a flexed knee to lessen the stretch on the hamstring (a knee flexor) and focus the hip extension work on the gluteus maximus. In that same respect, the reduced knee flexion makes plantar flexion work comparable to a seated calf raise, due to the lessened stretch on the gastrocnemius (like the hamstring, also a knee flexor). Since the pelvis is in the air, its weight can be shifted onto the feet allowing greater resistance. This is an awkward exercise due to the reduced stability and difficulty in adding resistance. If one were to raise a leg, the use of the arms to avoid falling sideways would often by necessary. If one were to place a padded barbell on the upper quadriceps to add resistance, this would make the arms less able to stabilize, requiring core stabilization. Straight-knee Pushing with the foot with a straighter knee stretches the gastrocnemius more, these movements incorporate it better. The soleus still contributes, usually allowing people to lift more weight. =Standing= Standing calf raises are executed with one or both feet. They are frequently done on a raised surface with the heel lower than the toes to allow a greater stretch on the working muscles. The exercise is performed by raising the heel as far as possible. Weights or other methods of providing resistance are commonly used, but the exercise is also effective with body weight alone. Balance may become a difficulty with free-standing calf raises, especially with older one-legged variations. Due to this, it is common to hang on to something or lean the hand against a wall for stability. They are also performed using Smith machines or using machines specially designed for calf raises with padded anchors for the weight that rest on the shoulders. =Leg press= A straight-knee calf raise is often done using the leg press machine. The sled is kept nearly locked out and the exerciser is meant to keep the hip and knee joints immobile. This is not a bodyweight exercise, the only body part actually being lifted is the small weight of the foot. The resistance comes from the sled. A leg press is easy to stabilize and the safety bar is kept in place so if the person can not lift it, it should come down safely. Exercise notes It is not uncommon to hear of some fitness trainers using reps of 50 or more, as they believe the gastrocnemius is composed of slow twitch fibers which benefit from lower weights and higher repetitions. This is not correct. The gastrocnemius is actually made up of fast twitch muscle fibers, which benefit more from heavy loads and low reps (6‚Äì8) on the standing calf raise. The soleus, on the other hand, is another plantarflexor of the ankle. The soleus is a slow twitch muscle and will benefit from high reps and lower loads on the seated calf raise.

History The Nehalim community was formed in 1938 by a core group of young, religious Bnei Akiva members from Jerusalem. They began agricultural training in Menahemia in the Jordan Valley. In 1944 they moved to a tract of swampy, malaria-infested land, about a kilometre south east of the site of the present kibbutz HaGoshrim, and lived in barracks without electricity or running water. Inspiration for the name Nehalim came from the network of brooks and streams in the area. After the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the residents were moved to the abandoned German Templer village of Wilhelma. The new moshav, in its present location south of Petah Tikva, was founded in 1953, with each family receiving a two-room house and 25 dunams of land. Landmarks Nehalim has one main synagogue, established by Jews of Ashkenazi background.

It serves to extend the Capital Crescent Trail where it merges with the active WMATA/CSX railroad into the National Capital. At Fort Totten, a connector trail to the Northwest Branch Trail of the Anacostia Tributary Trail System at Hyattsville, Maryland, will be constructed; and an on-street connection to the National Mall will be constructed from Union Station. When completed, the Metropolitan Branch Trail will serve as part of the East Coast Greenway. Seven miles of the trail are within Washington, D.C., and one mile (1.6 km) is in Maryland. The trail gets its name from the Metropolitan Subdivision of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;), which the trail parallels. The remainder of the trail closely parallels the current WMATA/CSX tracks into Maryland. It is anchored by two railroad landmarks: Union Station and the old B&O; Railroad Station in Silver Spring. History The Metropolitan Branch Trail was first conceived in 1988, by Patrick Hare of the Brookland neighborhood. Working with the Washington Area Bicyclist Association (WABA) and Rails-to-Trails Conservancy in 1989, Hare organized a group of 11 area cyclists to conduct an exploratory walk/ride. Soon after, motivated by CSX's plans to develop the Eckington Rail Yard needed for the trail, the Coalition for the Metropolitan Branch Trail was formed to explore and promote the potential for a multi-use trail. Before that, the trail was sometimes called the \\"Dome to Dome Trail\\" because it would connect the Capitol Dome and the Catholic University dome. The Metropolitan Branch Trail entered the DC Comprehensive Plan in the early 1990s and in 1997, the DC Department of Public Works (DPW) completed an engineering feasibility study that determined that it would be possible. Planning of the trail began in 1998 after Congress allocated $8.5 million in demonstration-project funding to the District for the trail through the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the six-year federal transportation funding bill; this was celebrated with a ground-breaking ceremony. In 1999, WABA published a concept plan for the trail that envisioned a large urban park and greenway along the abandoned, and as yet undeveloped, CSX Transportation property. In April 2001, WABA published a study describing the necessary acquisitions for the trail. In 2002, when the city and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) agreed to construct a new Metro station at New York and Florida Avenues, trail advocates and city staff negotiated for WMATA to build a portion of the trail as a part of the project. Around the same time the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC) completed a Feasibility Study and Concept Plan for one mile of the MBT between DC and Silver Spring. In 2003, the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) hired a special project manager for the trail, prepared a Takoma Alignment Study, and began development of the comprehensive concept plan, which was completed in 2005. Even as the planning was ongoing, work was underway in the District. After a groundbreaking ceremony on May 29, 1998, the District Department of Transportation built a nearly one-mile segment along John McCormack Road near Catholic University as part of routine road maintenance. It was built with $1.9 million of federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funding and was completed in November 1998. On October 21, 1999, the trail was named one of 50 Millennium Trails at a White House ceremony featuring First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater. Five days later, a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony was held at the Brookland-Catholic University Metro station to celebrate its designation as a Millennium Legacy Trail. It was attended by Slater; eight members of Congress; and representatives of NHTSA, FHWA, and the DC government. Another short, on-road trail section was built along First Street NE from Union Station in 2000. When the New York Ave‚ÄìFlorida Ave‚ÄìGallaudet University Metro station opened in November 2004, it included about of trail on a raised structure, but that section was inaccesible until 2010. Stairs from the New York Avenue Metro Station section to L Street NE, a trail under the tracks along L Street NE and a one block portion along 2nd Street NE were completed in the spring of 2008. The core of the trail, a 1.5-mile segment from New York Avenue to Franklin Street opened in May 2010, following a June 2009 start, making the whole DC section usable. On July 9, 2013, a 500-foot-long section between Monroe Street and the CUA Metro station opened as part of the Monroe Street Market development. On May 30, 2014, a roughly 2,000-foot section of the trail opened as a curb- protected, two-way bike lane along 1st Street NE from G Street NE to M Street NE. This was connected to the existing trail in November 2014 by a 572-foot protected bike lane on M Street, and then extended 812 feet south along 1st Street from G Street NE to the stub at Columbus Circle NE on August 12, 2015. The Rhode Island Avenue Pedestrian Bridge, which connects the trail on the west side of the extant railroad tracks with the Rhode Island Avenue Metro Station on the east side, opened on December 31, 2014, after more than 15 months of work. On October 31, 2017, DDOT issued a Notice to Proceed for the design-build construction of the next phase of the Metropolitan Branch Trail from John McCormack Drive in Brookland to the Fort Totten Metro Station. That work is to be completed in 2020. The first completed section, opened on June 17, 2020, was an 800-foot replacement of the connector between Gallatin St, NE and 1st Place, NE. On December 7, 2019, the section between Q and R Streets NE, closed since August 2019, reopened as part of construction of Alethia Tanner Park. The trail in that block had always hugged the outside of the parcel, but the new design allowed it to cut across the parcel, removing two very sharp turns. On March 18, 2020, NoMa Parks Foundation completed a Henry Thomas Way Drive connector as part of the same project. On June 25th Alethia Tanner Park, the park through which both ran, opened. Work was going on in Maryland too. A section in Montgomery County will connect the trail from DC to the Silver Spring Metro Center. The Montgomery County Planning Board approved a CCT/MetBranch Trail Facility Plan in 2001, but formal planning for the trail wasn't completed until 2017. Nonetheless, some work was rolled in to other projects and proceeded. In 2003, Montgomery College realigned Fenton street to make room for their Takoma campus expansion and this work included a half mile of mostly-paved trail, as there was a short section of water permeable stone- dust surface due to fear of tree-root damage. The campus expansion also included a bridge from the Takoma Park section over the railroad tracks to Jessup Blair Park in Silver Spring that opened on July 28, 2004. After further evaluation indicated the trees would not be significantly impacted the unpaved section along Fenton was paved in January 2006. Sections built as part of larger projects include a 100-foot section of a trail south of Ripley Street that was part of the 2012 Solaire building construction, a section from Colesville Road to Ripley Street in Silver Spring that opened in January and February of 2013 as part of the Silver Spring Transit Center, and a 0.05-mile section of the trail alongside the Progress Place development that was completed in late 2016, but will not be opened to the public until the county finishes its trail construction work. The first piece built by Montgomery County, not as part of some other project, was a two-block section along Fenton and King Streets that was completed in June 2018. The remainder of the trail in Montgomery County is to be completed in 2023. Meanwhile, work on the first piece of the Maryland section of the Prince George's County Connector Trail, from Eastern Avenue in DC to Russell Avenue in Maryland, began in 2009 and was completed in 2010. =Right-of-way= A substantial segment of the original Metropolitan Branch right-of-way south of Franklin Street NE (in some places, 200 feet wide) was originally marked as an extension of Delaware Avenue under the L'Enfant Plan. It was converted into railroad sidings for industrial uses on Capitol Hill in the late 19th-early 20th century, parallel to B&O; railroad. The Metropolitan Branch sidings became disused as industrial applications left the city, and the owner, CSX, which had already sold the active B&O; railroad tracks within the District to the Washington Metro under a joint use agreement, made plans to redevelop many of the properties along the right-of-way, leaving it as a staging ground for temporary construction uses. During this period, the wide, grassy strip became a popular short-cut for pedestrians and cyclists trying to access the new Red Line which runs along the corridor. Initially, WMATA engineered the Red Line to accommodate existing railroad uses in the corridor, bisecting the existing rail line and preserving many of the Metropolitan Branch sidings. In 1988, a decade after WMATA purchased and widened the active tracks, Montgomery County, Maryland purchased the Georgetown Branch of the B&O;, a single track spur feeding into the Metropolitan Branch from the north, for transportation use including an extension of the Capital Crescent Trail.Coalition for the Capital Crescent Trail. \\"A Brief History of the Georgetown Branch.\\" Accessed 2009-11-14. The remaining disused portions of the Metropolitan Branch spanned the distance parallel to the Red Line between the Georgetown Branch and Union Station, including sizable gaps north of Franklin Street, where the railroad had been widened by WMATA; the only available right-of-way for a trail in these areas was on adjacent parkland, or streets parallel to the railroad tracks. Subsequent alterations to the Metropolitan Branch Trail route have reduced the amount of right-of-way acquisition by placing substantial portions of the proposed trail on-street, while retaining a continuous off-street trail between Franklin Street and the New York Ave‚ÄìFlorida Ave‚ÄìGallaudet University Metro station.

Adults who are residents of British Columbia and who have already graduated from secondary school may take courses at SIDES to upgrade, however they are required to pay tuition fees if they choose to attend public secondary schools for this upgrading. If students are ordinarily residents of British Columbia, but are traveling or living abroad temporarily, they may take courses from anywhere in the world. History SIDES was established in 1988 as one of nine regional public \\"distance education\\" schools in British Columbia. At the time, the SIDES program was a paper-based program in which students worked in paper workbooks, sending assignments to the school via mail to be evaluated by teachers (known as \\"markers\\"). The program served students from grades K - 12 and worked with students only from the southern half of Vancouver Island and the nearby Gulf Islands. Today, the program is almost entirely online (with some print resources). Students may join the school from anywhere in the province.

With the neighbouring parish of Little Wolford it is part of 'The Wolfords'. History According to A Dictionary of British Place Names, Wolford derives from the Old English 'wulf' with 'weard', meaning a \\"place protected against wolves\\". The Concise Oxfordshire Dictionary of English Place-names adds that 'weard' might mean \\"guard\\", and as such might here be unique usage, as an \\"arrangement for protection, [or] fence\\", the whole name perhaps \\"enclosure to protect flocks from wolves\\".Mills, Anthony David (2003); A Dictionary of British Place Names, Oxford University Press, revised edition (2011), p.506 Ekwall, Eilert (1936); The Concise Oxfordshire Dictionary of English Place-names, Oxford University Press, 4th ed. (1960), p.529 In the Domesday Book, the settlement is variously listed as 'Ulware', 'Ulwarda' and 'Wolwarde', and in 1242 as 'Magna Wulleward'. In 1086, after the Norman Conquest, Little Wolford was in the Hundred of Barcheston and county of Warwickshire. There were three Tenants-in-chief to king William I: Bishop Odo of Bayeux, Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester (Count of Meulan), and Robert de Stafford. Bishop Odo retained Gerald as his lord, who had acquired the title from the 1066 lord Aelfric (uncle of Thorkil) ‚Äì the manor contained three villagers, one ploughland with 0.5 men's plough team, and of meadow. The land of the Count of Meluan had Ralf as lord, again acquiring the title from the 1066 lord Aelfric - the manor contained three villagers, five smallholders, two slaves, and four ploughlands with one lord's plough team and one men's plough team. De Stafford had three manorial lands. Firstly, one where he was also Lord, this acquired from the 1066 lord Vagn (of Wootton), which contained eight villagers, eight smallholders, four slaves and a priest, with ten ploughlands, six men's plough teams and a mill. Secondly, one with Ordwy as lord, acquired from the 1066 lord Alwy, which contained four villagers, four smallholders, six ploughlands, and two lord's and one men's plough teams. Thirdly, where Alwin was the lord in 1066 and 1086, which contained four villagers, three smallholders, a slave, and two ploughlands with one lord's and one men's plough teams.

Retrieved 16 October 2019 After Robert de Stafford died (c.1100), his manor at Wolford passed through his sister Milicent de Stafford (who married Hervey Bagot), to her son Hervey de Stafford, who had adopted his mother's name. The manor was divided in 1242 at the time of the later Robert de Stafford, becoming Great and Little Wolford. Ownership of the two manors stayed with the Stafford family, including the 15th-century Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham. In 1521 Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham was executed by Henry VIII for treason. The year before he had, through trustees, sold the manors to Henry's courtier, Sir William Compton. The manors of Great and Little Wolford stayed in the Compton family until 1819, however, at about 1600 they were bought by Robert Catesby, the leader of the group of English Catholics who planned the failed 1605 Gunpowder Plot. They were then, in 1605, transferred to a Thomas Spencer and an Edward Sheldon, by Catesby, Sir Thomas Leigh, and Lord Ellesmere whose wife was sister to the second wife of Henry, Lord Compton. Because of transaction inconsistency, the manors reverted to the Compton family. In 1819 they were sold, by Charles Compton, Marquess of Northampton, to Lord Redesdale, they subsequently passing to his son John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Earl of Redesdale. The unmarried earl then left the manors to Algernon Bertram Mitford, created Baron Redesdale in 1902. After his death in 1916, the manors passed to David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, the father of the Mitford sisters. Wolford, including Great and Little Wolford, in 1903 During the 19th century Great Wolford, and its directory-listed parish hamlet of Little Wolford, was part of the Brailes division of the Kington Hundred. In 1801 parish population was 278, and in 1821, 529. By 1841 the township of Great Wolford, contained 311 inhabitants in 58 houses, and 583 in the whole parish, in an area of with soil, \\"on the whole good\\", of clay, sand, gravel, and bog. Within the parish were \\"many\\" mineral springs, but not used medicinally. A school, erected in 1821 by Lord Redesdale, with attached schoolmaster's house, was mainly supported by subscription. The Church of St Michael accommodated seating for 460, of which 338 were free ‚Äî not designated for particular persons. The incumbent's income was by a 'discharged vicarage' ‚Äî all vicarages under ten pounds a year, and all rectories under ten marks, were discharged from the payment of first-fruits, also called annates, being the first year's revenues, together with one tenth of the income in all succeeding years. The previous Wolford tithes had been commuted ‚Äî tithes were typically one-tenth of the produce or profits of parish land given to the rector for his services and were commuted under the 1836 Tithe Commutation Act, and usually substituted with a yearly rent-charge payment. The Wolford vicar's income was augmented by private benefactions of ¬£400, Queen Anne's Bounty of ¬£200, and a parliamentary grant of ¬£300. Support for the incumbent also came from in total of glebe‚Äîan area of land used to support a parish priest‚Äîand provision of a residence. Patronage (advowson) of the parish living was held by the Warden and Fellows of Merton College, Oxford. Lord Redesdale was lord of the manor and chief landowner. Directory listed trades and occupations in 1850 included the parish rector, a schoolmaster, the licensee of the Fox and Hounds public house, a corn miller, a carpenter, and eight farmers.\\"Little Wolford\\", A topographical dictionary of England, Samuel Lewis (London, 1848), vol.

Twenty skeletons were found, supposed to be those of persons slain near the spot of a skirmish during the war of the 17th century. By 1896 Great Wolford is recorded again as in the Brailes division of Kineton Hundred, and in the Brailes petty sessional division. It was in the Shipston-on-Stour Union‚Äîpoor relief provision set up under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834‚Äîand county court district.

In tourist destinations like Dubai, South Africa, Thailand, Indonesia, the Spanish Coast, Costa Rica and the Greek Islands, resort wear is growing in popularity. It has become a cross-cultural style that signifies relaxation, affluence, and appreciation of nature which displays a sense of style to the wearer. From walking shorts, caftans and sandals, to full-length evening dresses for women and light dinner jackets for men, resort wear is unique in its design and function. Resort wear is generally made from cotton, silk, denim, microfiber, straw, light linen and poplin that are easy to pack, lightweight and breathable. They are easy to clean and look great without ironing. It is characterized by the \\"nautical\\" style, inspired by sailor and yachting themes, classic Hawaiian prints of palm trees and hula girls, brushed denim from San Francisco, bright floral prints from South America, minty greens, yellows, blues and whites from the Mediterranean and natural materials and glove-weight leathers from the Caribbean. Large hats, sunglasses, open-toed shoes and innovative waistlines complete the look of sun-soaked destinations. In recent years, resort wear has evolved to include items such as boilersuits and floaty dresses that can be incorporated into customers‚Äô autumn wardrobes as well. Though mainstream fashion houses like J.

Several upstarts like Devereux have created entire brands around relaxed, resort-style athletic motifs.Devereux Moreover, resort wear also encompasses swimsuits and bathing suit cover ups, with brands like KIINI which specialize in this segment of the resort wear market. There are also brands originating from destination islands where resort wear is a main staple and is worn all year round, such as BIASA from Bali, Psylo from Koh Samui, and Villebrequin from Saint Tropez.

Some legends say that one year was 60 days in ancient China; that made him more than 130 years old. Others say he was over 200 years old or over 400 years old. Another says he was accidentally left off of the death list in heaven. Peng Zu was regarded as a saint in Taoism. The pursuit of elixir of life by practitioners of Taoism was highly influenced by Peng Zu. He is well known in Chinese culture as a symbol for longevity, nutrition treatments, and sex therapy treatments. Legend maintains he married more than 100 wives and fathered hundreds of children, as late as in his 834. According to the Spring and Autumn period's Guoyu (Discourses of the States), the Han dynasty's Shiben (Genealogy), and the Tang dynasty's Kuodi Zhi (Record of Geography), Peng Zu was the founder of Dapeng and made marquis by the kings of the Shang dynasty. Description One of his life extending techniques was coitus skill, which purportedly extracts female energy into the male body (harvesting from Yin to supplement Yang). He also ate yen on a daily basis to sustain life. He ate naturally and used herbs to enrich his nutrition. He was known for cooking excellent soup.Connell, Brendan (2012). Lives of Notorious Cooks.

Early years Charles Percy Parkhurst was born in 1913 in Columbus, Ohio. He entered Oberlin College as a music major, then later a physics student, but after the science department prohibited him from conducting a personal research project, he transferred to Williams College. At Williams, Parkhurst initially studied geology but was inspired by Professor Karl E. Weston, the founder of the Williams College Museum of Art, to major in fine arts and pursue a career in the field. Following his graduation from Williams in 1935, Parkhurst spent the next two years building bridges and roads in Alaska before returning to Oberlin for an M.A., which he completed in 1938. At the urging of his mentor, Clarence Ward, Parkhurst went on to obtain his master‚Äôs in fine art from Princeton University in 1941. At Princeton, Parkhurst heard lectures by scholars such as Erwin Panofsky, Charles Rufus Marey, George Rawley, and Albert M. Friend. He had a fellowship with Paul J. Sachs, a Byzantine expert, at Dumbarton Oaks, but never a superb linguist, Parkhurst felt that he was unqualified for this position and left to become a research assistant at the National Gallery of Art along with his fellow student Craig Hugh Smyth. For most of World War II, Parkhurst served in the Navy as a gunnery officer in the Mediterranean. In 1943, Franklin Roosevelt established an art recovery division, named the Roberts Commission after its chairman Justice Owen Roberts, to repatriate art stolen by the Nazis. Parkhurst was part of the art recovery group and became deputy chief of Monuments, Fines Arts, and Archives in Germany. Immediately after the War, Parkhurst was promoted to lieutenant and he served with around thirty others at the former national headquarters of the Nazi party in Munich. The group recovered more five million dollars worth of artifacts and artworks. Though Parkhurst was made a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur by the French Government in 1948, he had been discharged from the Navy for signing the Wiesbaden Manifesto. Working years When Charles Parkhurst returned to the United States from the front, he found a job at the Albright Art gallery in Buffalo, now known as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, as the assistant curator to Andrew Carnduff Ritchie who had served in Parkhurst‚Äôs infantry division. In 1949, he returned to Oberlin as the college‚Äôs chair of the Fine Arts Department and the director of the Allen Memorial Art Museum, where he succeeded Clarence Ward. In an interview, Parkhurst explained that at the Allen Memorial Art Museum, \\"we were collecting for elucidation and delight.\\" At Oberlin, Parkhurst founded the Intermuseum Conservation Laboratory in 1952, which was originally located on the campus but has since moved to Cleveland. This institution was the nation‚Äôs first regional, non-profit art conservation center. Parkhurst was appointed the director of the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1962 and married Rima Zevin Julyan that same year. Succeeding long-time director Adelyn Dohme Breeskin, Parkhurst acknowledged, \\"So I succeeded Adelyn; didn‚Äôt replace her. She‚Äôs irreplaceable, she‚Äôs the queen of museum directors.‚Äù Nevertheless, he managed to build up the American decorative arts, painting, and furniture collections. During his tenure as director, a Conservation Department was established in the Museum, a new floor was added to the American Wing, the Wurtzburger Collection of modern sculpture was added to the collection, and several friends groups were put together. Parkhurst also assisted in establishing the Maryland State Arts Council and the Maryland Revolutionary War Bicentennial Commission.Rosenthal, Gertrude, \\"Charles Parkhurst: His Years as the Museum's Director,\\" The Baltimore Museum of Art Record, Vol. 1, No. 4 (December 1970): p. 3-6. Parkhurst once commented that the ‚ÄúBaltimore Museum was one of the great unknown museums at the time.‚Äù During that same period, he was also elected president of the American Association of Museums in 1966 and developed an accreditation system for museums similar to the ones used by universities. In 1970, Parkhurst assumed the role as assistant director and chief curator of the National Gallery of Art. He proved to be instrumental in the construction phase of the Gallery‚Äôs East Building. He retired from this post in 1983 to teach and curate in the museums at Williams College and Smith College. After his second marriage also ended in divorce, he married Carol Clark in 1986. Charles Parkhurst died in his home in Massachusetts at the age of ninety-five.

Schools Acorn Park School is a registered children's home and school for children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders and is part of the Acorn Care and Education Group. Banham Marshalls College, an independent school in the village, was subject to Norfolk's biggest ever child-cruelty investigation, along with another school in Banham which was known as The Old Rectory School. As a result of the investigation into the schools, which were for children with special needs and ostensibly specialised in Emotional and Behaviourial Disorders, the proprietor of each and former head teacher, George Robson, received a two-year suspended prison sentence. George Robson died the day after his sentencing. The charges were brought by ex-pupils of the school dating as far back as 1976. Most of the charges related to The Old Rectory School, although some children from Banham Marshalls College had made complaints, some of which resulted in the conviction of David Clarke. Robson's brother, Anthony, was also sentenced for crimes committed at The Old Rectory School. Robert Wilson, a teacher and later principal, was likewise convicted of acts of cruelty involving vulnerable children but was cleared on appeal on the basis that the judge had made an error in his summing-up. Given that the evidence was not consistent and the judge had misled the jury, the conviction was deemed to be unsafe. Banham Marshalls College was closed down by the DfES in 2003. The site is now occupied by Acorn Park School, which has no connection with the former Banham Marshalls College.

The company's largest investors are WestRiver Group and Callaway Golf. TopGolf locations in Australia are run by a joint venture of Topgolf International (3.7%) and Village Roadshow Theme Parks. In Canada, a joint venture with Cineplex Entertainment has been established to operate locations there.  History  Twin brothers Steve and Dave Jolliffe had sold their mystery- shopping business and were looking for a new project in 1997. Both golfers, they began complaining about golf's issues: the time factor and lackluster driving ranges. Looking to improve the game, the Jolliffes looked to the then- new commercial microchip technology and placed it in the golf ball. From this, they designed a new game, Topgolf, which is a redesigned driving range. In Watford, just outside London, the twins built the first location, which opened in 2000. The golfing community and businesses were not enthusiastic about the game. The PGA and golf equipment companies refused to get involved. In 2003, bankers approached Richard Grogan to invest but were rejected. Grogan later had been induced to visit the Topgolf facility in February 2004. Seeing only a 5% return on investment, Grogan turned them down again, although he was otherwise impressed during the visit. Grogan with three other partners‚ÄîDavid Main, Eric Wilkinson, Tom Mendell‚Äîthen struck upon how to increase business by making it an experience by having an event space, larger kitchens, and restaurants, making locations 3 to 4 times the original's size. Grogan, Main, Wilkinson, Mendell founded and started up the US licensee, Topgolf International, and found investors. WestRiver Group was a lead investor. Alexandria, Virginia was selected due to its close proximity to Washington, D.C., which could attract government officials from golf courses. This location opened in 2005. This location struggled so Grogan decided, although it is in a colder climate, to open a location in Chicago. Snow closed the location for its first four weeks and caused equipment damage. The next Topgolf location, Dallas, was selected for its connection to golf, a warmer environment, and Fortune 500 companies. With little traffic at any location, Grogan expect to be closed by May 2007. With an energetic Dallas staff in February 2007, Grogan and Main brainstormed a number of low-tech marketing techniques to draw customers as they needed to explain Topgolf like in the UK. After six months, the Dallas facility had a six-hour wait. In 2009, Topgolf International (US) acquired Topgolf UK then in July from World Golf Systems the TopGolf intellectual property aspects. By 2011, WestRiver's head Erik Anderson took over the executive chairman post from Grogan. Anderson move to have newer location even larger with full line kitchens with executive chefs replacing small kitchens and more golfer space. Ten locations were opened in 2013. Topgolf had sales of $163.5 million in 2014 to make the Inc. 500. Mobile phone apps were issued in 2013, with social media digital walls added to locations in 2015. By 2015, Topgolf had 28 locations that brought in 8 million customers. In January 2016, the company purchased the World Golf Tour gaming company. Also that year, Protracer golf ball tracking technology was purchased and renamed Toptracer. Topgolf and Village Roadshow Theme Parks agreed in 2016 to a joint venture to bring Topgolf to Australia. Village Roadshow received a 67% stake in the joint venture by providing 100% of the startup funds. On June 23, 2016, it was announced that Village Roadshow would open a venue next door to its popular theme parks, Warner Bros. Movie World in Oxenford, Queensland in Australia. This was the first Topgolf venue outside the US and the UK The location opened in June 2018. Village indicated in March 2018 that they were looking for location proposals for up to eight Australia and Asia/Pacific locations. In July 2018, Village Roadshow sold $50 million in shares to fund Topgolf and for other purposes. In August 2018, Topgolf Australia reduced its stake in the joint venture from 33% to 3.7% with options to boost its share back up to 33% before December 31, 2020. Despite this action, Village Roadshow CEO Clark Kirby said the company continues to actively pursue other locations after encouraging financial results from Topgolf Australia. In 2017, Topgolf created a new television series titled Who Will Rock You, where eight of the best unsigned bands across the country compete for $50,000 and a Topgolf tour. Season one premiered in May 2018 won by Crimson Riot! female-led rock group. A second season with Matador Content and music publisher BMG was agreed upon with a March 28, 2019 start with 12 unsigned bands and a prize of $50,000 and signing with BMG. Topgolf Studios had four series available on its YouTube channel by October 2, 2019. At that time, the unit agreed with Will Smith's Westbrook Media to produce additional series with the unit for Topgolf starting with This Joka comedian documentary series. Canadian movie theatre company Cineplex Entertainment announced it entered a joint venture with Topgolf in July 2017 to open several Topgolf entertainment locations across Canada. This is Topgolf's first foray into Canada. Topgolf gave the Seattle area a preview of the venue with its first Crush event at Safeco Field in February 2017. On April 9, 2019, the company announced the first location for a new smaller version of its venue, Topgolf Lounge, in Kirkland, Washington and opened in January 2020.

The further the shot goes and the closer to the pin, the more points the player receives. *Top Break ‚Äì has a snooker based format in which a player must hit a red target then a coloured target. The higher value colours, the more points are awarded. *Top Chip ‚Äì Use just the red target (5 shots), yellow target (5 shots) and green target (10 shots). Hit the correct target to earn points, but hit the wrong one and points are deducted. *Top Shot ‚Äì Similar to TopChip. You have to hit targets at four consecutive distances (5 shots each) Whichever starting target you choose (red, yellow, green or brown) determines the games level of difficulty *Top Pressure ‚Äì An accuracy game, in which you need to hit all nine sections within the yellow target.

Plot =Overview= Laura, a nude model, returns to her small-town hometown after learning her ex-boyfriend has begun a relationship with her aunt Cynthia. =Synopsis= During a photo shoot, nude model Laura (Isadora Edison) receives a phone call from her sister Winnifred (Chelsea Mundae). Laura learns that her ex-boyfriend, high-powered attorney Nelson Nyland (John Samuel Jordan), is dating her aunt Cynthia (Tina Tyler); not only that, they are making plans to move in together. While she tells Winnie that's she's pleased, Laura is emotionally hurt. After hanging up, Laura asks her photographer, Jennine (Andrea Davis), for a few weeks off. Jennine agrees, commenting that she has some good shots for her editor. Intercut with a montage of Laura and Jennine having sex, Jennine comments that she has \\"an awful schoolgirl crush\\" on Laura. Laura is initially put off, but then passionately kisses Jennine. Meanwhile, in Meadow Springs, Nelson visits his law partner, and sister, Judith (Kay Kirtland). Judith invites Nelson out to a romantic dinner, but Nelson explains that he is expected by Cynthia. At Cynthia's cabin, Nelson arrives to find Cynthia seductively rubbing herself. Making himself comfortable, Nelson approaches her from behind and cups her breasts. After several minutes of foreplay, they retire to the bedroom. At a cafe, Winnie (Chelsea Mundae) asks her co-worker Louise (A.J. Khan) why she pushed Winnie so hard into telling Laura about Cynthia and Nelson. Louise admits that she is a potential novelist, and that she is writing an expos√© about the town's sexual goings-on. The scene then intercuts with both Nelson and Cynthia, and Laura and Jennine having sex. Cast * Isadora Edison as Laura Spencer * Andrea Davis as Jennine * Chelsea Mundae as Winnifred * A.J.

Mundae initially agreed, but in time backed out, wanting to get out of the porn industry. Wells left the project soon afterwards. To replace his stars, producer Michael Raso turned to redhead Isadora Edison, who had made an impression on him in the film SpiderBabe. For the role of Cynthia, he wanted an older woman and turned to porn veteran Tina Tyler. Tyler had worked with Joe Sarno before, and enjoyed the script. Since the film dealt with incest, the first question Tyler asked was \\"are you sure the content is legal?\\" Sarno countered that as long as the actors weren't related, they should be fine. As with most, if not all, of Joe Sarno's films, the sex scenes were written around the plot, instead of the plot written around the sex scenes. =DVD extras= The extras were spread over two DVD's. The first DVD includes a ten- minute featurette titled ‚ÄúInside Suburban Secrets‚Äù which shares comments and insights about the film from cast and crew.

Invented in 1857 by Jackson, Alan A.; The Railway Dictionary; 4th ed., Sutton Publishing; Stroud; (2006); p. 28; . and usually then known as a pony truck, it is a very simple and common means of designing a carrying wheel. Name variants LNER Class V2 4771 Green Arrow showing pony truck in front of cylinders and driving wheels A pony truck in railway terminology, is a leading truck with only two wheels. Its invention is generally credited to Bissell, who devised one in 1857 and patented it the following year. Hence the term Bissel bogie, Bissel truck, or Bissel axle is used in continental Europe. In the UK, the term is Bissell truck.Spellings\\"; Conservative locomotive builders in Bissell's native United States did not take to the new design, and it was not implemented until after the Eastern Counties Railway in the United Kingdom fitted one to their No. 248 in 1859. Pony trucks of similar design became very popular on British locomotives thereafter. Properties and use Drawing from Patent US62727 A locomotive with a Bissell axle is able to both turn about its vertical axis and swing radially to the side, movements advantageous to steam locomotives because their position on the track is dictated by the driving or coupled wheels. The Bissel truck also helps stabilize a train in a turn, where centrifugal force causes a locomotive to lean away from the track. It features a pair of inclined planes which mate with an opposing set on the engine's frame where the two join. The more a truck moves to the side, the greater the lift to the outside of the locomotive, canting it slightly into the curve. Though the system was effective, casting and machining its sloping surfaces was expensive. A refinement, the Hudson-Bissell truck, delivered the same result using less costly components. Instead of resting upon opposing planes, the engine frame is joined to the truck by two swing links. As the truck pivots sideways the outside of the locomotive is elevated, a practical modification used right to the end of the steam era. =Equalizing= Partly because load was not equalized between the Bissell pony truck and the leading drivers, the pony truck did not become instantly popular in the US. Locomotives in the UK were generally not equalized, so it was not considered a problem there. John P. Laird was the first to attempt to equalize the pony truck with the drivers in 1857; he received a patent on the concept in 1866. Laird's design was complex and did not find favor, although he incorporated it on some locomotives he built or rebuilt, particularly on the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad and later the Pennsylvania Railroad. John H. Whetstone of Cincinnati, working for Niles and Company, was the next to devise a method for equalizing; in this scheme, the truck frame was itself the equalizing beam as well. Niles went bankrupt before the patent was granted, and no locomotive was ever fitted with this design. Guide frame of a Bissel truck on French SNCF Class 141R1199 2-8-2 steam locomotive A more successful scheme for equalizing the pony truck to the drivers was invented by William S. Hudson, superintendent of the Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works, and patented in 1864. In this design, a large equalizing lever linked the front truck with a transverse bar connected to the front spring hangers of the driving wheels. This design was an immediate success and was used on American-built locomotives until the end of steam building. Terminology In the US, these trucks were known as lead trucks. A pony truck was the lead truck on a horse drawn rail car or trolley. A pony truck required a hitch to attach horses. The term, when applied to US steam locomotives after 1900, is considered archaic. Pony trucks are not quite analogous to an articulated locomotive. The pony truck can move radially around a real or virtual pivot. When the pivot is situated at a point inside the truck, the truck is called a bogie. What makes it a Bissel bogie is the pivot being placed outside to the rear or fore.'Railway Wonders of the World' Eds: Clarence Winchester & Cecil J. Allen, Amalgamated Press London c1935 page 978  Examples  Examples of steam engines fitted with Bissell trucks include the German DRG Class 64 and Class 99.73-76 locomotives. Some older electric locomotives have Bissell trucks, if the driving axles are located in the main frame rather than the now usual bogies.

The eastern provinces of the Eastern Roman and later the Byzantine Empires inherited a strong artistic tradition from Late Antiquity. The tradition of making mosaics was carried on in the Umayyad era until the end of the 8th century. The great majority of these works of art were later destroyed but archeological excavations unearthed many surviving examples.  The Madaba region  Upper part of Hippolytus mosaic in Madaba The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the Madaba Map, made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at Madaba, Jordan. It was rediscovered in 1894. The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the Holy Land. It depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south, and from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert. The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem, at the center of the map. The map is enriched with many naturalistic features, like animals, fishing boats, bridges and palm trees. One of the earliest examples of Byzantine mosaic art in the region can be found on Mount Nebo, a place of pilgrimage in the Byzantine era where Moses died. Among the many 6th century mosaics in the church complex in an area known as Siyagha (discovered after 1933) the most interesting one is located in the baptistery. The intact floor mosaic in the Byzantine monastery, built on the foundations of an even earlier chapel from the third or fourth century CE, was laid down in circa 530. It covers an area of 9 x 3 m and depicts the monastic pastime of wine-making, as well as hunters, with a rich assortment of Middle Eastern flora and fauna. The Church of Sts. Lot and Procopius was founded in 567 in Nebo village under Mount Nebo (now Khirbet Mukhayyat). Its floor mosaic depicts everyday activities like grape harvest. Another two spectacular mosaics were discovered in the ruined Church of Preacher John nearby. One of the mosaics was placed above the other one which was completely covered and unknown until the modern restoration. The figures on the older mosaic have thus escaped the iconoclasts.http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/sites2.htm#Khirbet al Mukhayat The town of Madaba remained an important center of mosaic making during the 5-8th centuries. In the Church of the Apostles even the name of the master mosaicist, Salomios was also recorded (from 568). In the middle of the main panel Thalassa, goddess of the sea, can be seen surrounded by fishes and other sea creatures. Native Middle Eastern birds, mammals, plants and fruits were also added. The Church of Prophet Elijah was built in 607. Its carpet- like central panel in the nave framed by a row of medaillons depicting native animals. Mosaic was used as a decoration not only for churches but for rich private residences like the Hippolytos Hall and the Burnt Palace (both from the early 6th century). They follow the classical Greco-Roman tradition with mythological and allegorical scenes like the Four Seasons, Phaedra and Hippolytos, Venus and Adonis, the Three Graces and the city goddesses of Madaba, Rome and Gregoria (in the Hippolytos Hall); hunting scenes, fight of a bull and a lion (in the Burnt Palace). Mosaic floor from the church on Mount Nebo (baptistery, 530) The early 7th-century church complex of Tell Mar Elias, the birthplace of Prophet Elijah, (in present-day Jordan, near Ajlun) was discovered in 1999. The floor of the cruciform main church is decorated with wonderfully intact, multi-colored mosaics with floral and geometric motifs (flowers, leaves, scrolls, braided patterns, amphorae) without any representations of animals or humans. One large mosaic floor inscription in white letters on a red background says that the presbyter Saba and his wife offered the church to God as an expression of their faith, in the year 622.ASOR Outreach Features: Tell Mar Elias excavation Another holy place, Bethany Beyond the Jordan (Al Maghtas), the scene of the baptism of Jesus, was excavated after 1994. Floor mosaics were discovered in the 5-6th century Church of the Arch, the Church of the Trinity and also the 5th century Rhotorios Monastery (with Greek inscriptions). The floor here was covered by a colored mosaic with a frame and cross marks depicted with geometrical designs. On the other side of the lower Jordan Valley another church was discovered in ancient Archelais (now Khirbet el-Beiyudat). According to inscriptions its floor was paved with mosaics during the 560s. The monastic complex above Lot‚Äôs Cave (near the southern end of the Dead Sea), which was uncovered after 1988, contained five mosaics, one dated April 606, another May 691. Another important mosaic site around Madaba is ancient Esbus, present-day Tell Hesban where two Byzantine churches have been discovered. Both churches produced impressive remains of mosaic floors which is not surprising given the fact that Esbus was an ecclesiastical center with its own bishop.Preservation and Restoration Particularly interesting is the nilotic mosaic of the presbytery of the North Church where the mosaicists have created a motif of a turtledove set on a nest made of an imaginary flower. Christian mosaics were also discovered in other settlements in the surroundings of Madaba like Ma'in and Massuh, testifying the widespread popularity of the craft in Byzantine times and the importance of the Madaba area as an artistic center. The church at Massuh has two layers of floor mosaics. The lower one, from the 6th century, has no iconoclastic damage, while the upper layer, from the 7th century, was systematically altered by iconoclasts. Figures were carefully replaced by crosses, or floral and architectural motifs.MWNF - Museum With No Frontiers The Transfiguration of Jesus in the Saint Catherine's Monastery Egypt Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai. Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine's Monastery is exceptional. On the upper wall Moses is shown in two panels on a landscape background. In the apse we can see the Transfiguration of Jesus on a golden background. The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets, and two contemporary figure, \\"Abbot Longinos\\" and \\"John the Deacon\\". The mosaic was probably created in 565/6. The Holy Land Georgian Bir el Qutt inscriptions on a Byzantine mosaic floor. Jerusalem with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called \\"Armenian Mosaic\\" which was discovered in 1894 near the Damascus Gate. It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine's branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: \\"For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows.\\" The symbolism of the mosaic indicates that the room was used to remember the dead as a mortuary chapel. In the Dominus Flevit Church on Mount Olives a 7th-century Byzantine chapel was unearthed in 1955. The floor is richly decorated with intersecting circles and pictures of fruit, leaves, flowers, and fish. A Greek inscription mentions Simon, who \\"decorated this place of prayer in honor of Jesus\\". In the nearby Church of the Agony (built originally in the last decades of the 4th century) a colorful mosaic floor was discovered in 1920 which follows a geometric design. Fragments of a similar geometric mosaic floor were preserved in the Basilica of St. Stephen (outside the Damascus Gate) which was built by Empress Aelia Eudocia in the first half of the 5th century. Detail of the mosaic floor from the church of Emmaus Nicopolis On the outskirts of Jerusalem in the Monastery of the Cross a section of the elaborate 5th century mosaic floor survived, incorporating pictures of peacocks, plants and geometric patterns. Early Byzantine mosaics were preserved in the Church of John the Baptist in Ein Kerem, the Beit Jimal Monastery (in the 5th century the Church of the Tomb of St. Stephen, mosaics discovered in 1916), the Church of the Seat of Mary (Kathisma) (from the 5-8th centuries, floral and geometric designs, cornucopiae, discovered in 1992-7) and the lower church at Shepherds' Field (or Beit Sahour, the Greek Orthodox site, a floor including crosses, and therefore must predate 427). An exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in Bethany, the early Byzantine church of the Lazarium which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem. A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor. In 2003 during the construction works of the Israeli West Bank barrier in Abu Dis workers damaged the remains of a Byzantine monastery which was subsequently excavated. The monastery church had an elaborate mosaic floor decorated with images of animals including a deer and an octopus. Ruins of three Byzantine churches were discovered in the village of Beit Jibrin (ancient Eleutheropolis). One was decorated with an exquisite mosaic depicting the four seasons but it was defaced during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The other church north of the wadi was excavated in 1941-1942. Its floor mosaic have octagons with representations of birds, quadrupeds, and scenes from the story of Jonah depicting the prophet being thrown out of the boat or resting. In nearby Emmaus Nicopolis two Byzantine basilicas were built in the 6-7th centuries above the house of Cleopas, which was venerated by Christians as the place of the breaking of bread by the risen Christ. Both were decorated with mosaic floors. In the northern nave of the southern basilica, a nilotic mosaic portrayed birds, animals and flowers.emmaus.nicopolis - Byzantine period (324-637 A.D.) In Abu Gosh a 5th-century mosaic floor was preserved in the modern Church of the Ark of the Covenant. Detail from the mosaic floor of the Byzantine church of in Masada. The monastic community lived here in the 5-7th centuries. The monastic communities of the Judean Desert also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors. The Monastery of Martyrius was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982-85. The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich.The Monastery of Martyrius The mosaics in the church of the nearby Monastery of Euthymius are of later date (discovered in 1930). They were laid down in the Umayyad era, after a devastating earthquake in 659. Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features. The church floor was later replaced with rough opus sectile (probably by the Crusaders). In 1995-99 two large Byzantine churches were discovered in Khirbet Yattir (ancient Iethira) in the southern part of the Judean Desert. They belonged to monastic communities and were paved with beautiful mosaics in the 6-7th centuries. Two phases can be distinguished in the mosaic floor of Church C. The earlier was decorated with four birds and medallions of vines while the later one was divided into 23 strips which contain magical symbols and holy names. The dedicatory inscription dates this mosaic to the year 631/32. The most important Byzantine mosaics in Samaria were discovered in Shilo where three basilicas were uncovered. The large mosaic floor of the Church of the Ark (completed in 420, re-discovered in 2006) contains geometric designs, flora representations and three Greek inscriptions, among them a salute to the residents of Seilun (Shilo). On 2017, during a salvage excavation ahead of telephone cable infrastructure placement, archaeologists uncovered a rare Greek mosaic, about a kilometer north of the Old City on a road leading to the Damascus Gate. The inscription on the mosaic reads, ‚ÄúIn the time of our most pious emperor Flavius Justinian, also this entire building Constantine the most God-loving priest and abbot, established and raised, in the 14th indiction.‚Äù Archeologists called the find ‚Äúextremely exciting,‚Äù saying that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not every day that one finds an inscription ‚Äî a ‚Äòdirect letter‚Äô from someone ‚Äî from 1,500 years ago.‚Äù The word ‚Äúindiction,‚Äù is an ancient method of counting years for taxation purposes. Based on historical sources, the mosaic can be dated to the year 550/551 CE.Outside Jerusalem‚Äôs Old City, a once-in-a- lifetime find of ancient Greek inscriptionImportant ancient inscription unearthed near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem Galilee Two mosaic sites were discovered in the vicinity of modern-day Nahariya in Western Galilee. One that now belongs to moshav Shavei Tzion was a 5-6th-century church that stood immediately on the seashore. The main motifs of its carpet-like, decorative floor are red swastikas on white background. The other church is located on a hill called Khirbet Ittaim. The tri-apsidal basilica was built in 555 by the bishop of Tyre and was destroyed in 614 by the Persians. The remarkable mosaic floor has figurative scenes like a hunter attacking a tiger in the south apse, a man with a horse, a sitting man playing a flute and two beautiful peacocks drinking from the fountain of life. In 1940 a 6th-century Byzantine church was discovered in present-day Hanita. Among the mainly decorative motifs of its mosaic floor there are two animal scenes: a boar grazing on a field and a hare eating grapes (the latter is very uncommon). Both are considered a symbol of redemption. The mosaic decoration of the Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth, which was one of the great Constantinian basilicas of the Holy Land, was totally destroyed during the centuries together with much of the basilica. Archeological evidences prove that prior to the mid-4th century another small church stood on the site. A mosaic inscription referring to Deacon Conon survived of this building. The existence of a large Byzantine church on the site of the present-day Sisters of Nazareth convent was proven in 2006-2007. This church was architecturally complex and elaborately decorated, it was floored with polychrome mosaic (of which only very scant remains survived) and also had polychrome wall mosaics. Further mosaic-floored Byzantine buildings were located to the south of the church. This evidence indicates that Byzantine Nazareth contained two large churches dominating its centre, with other mosaic-floored and colonnaded masonry structures around them. As such the town had to be an important Byzantine pilgrimage centre.BYZANTIUM - Society for the Promotion of Byzantine Studies Online On the top of nearby Mount Tabor which was venerated as the place of the Transfiguration of Christ another great church was built before 422. A small portion of its mosaic floor survived. The Monastery of Lady Mary near Bet She'an was established in 567. Many rooms and the church itself was decorated with mosaic among them a great zodiac, a circle of 12 figures representing the months, with the sun god Helios and the moon goddess Selene in the centre. Similar mosaic zodiacs were found in contemporary Jewish synagogues. Other mosaics represent vine tendrils, hunters, animals and birds. There is a 5th-century church located at Kursi on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The site is connected with the biblical Gergesa as the location where Jesus cast a legion of demons from a possessed person. The mosaics visible today include geometric patterns, birds, cucumbers, gourds, melons, and grape clusters. Petra and the desert Detail from the mosaic floor of the Petra Church Mosaic art also flourished in Christian Petra where three Byzantine churches were discovered. The most important one was uncovered in 1990. It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual. The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century. In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed. They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals, and personifications of the Seasons, Ocean, Earth and Wisdom. Mosaic covered churches prove that the towns along the Nabatean spice road in the Negev Desert flourished in the Christian era. In Mamshit two great churches survived. The Eastern Church (or Church of the Martyrs) was probably built in the late 4th century and has a geometric floor with crosses. The mosaics of the Western (or Nile) Church are more elaborate depicting birds, fruit basket, swastikas and flowers. An inscription in a medallion reads: \\"God, save your servant Nilus, lover of Jesus, who founded this building. Preserve him and his household.\\" Several mosaics were discovered around Gaza which was an important centre of Christianity during the Byzantine era. The most publicized of these discoveries were made in 1917 by Australian troops fighting against the Ottomans at Shellal. The church stood upon a small hill above Wadi Guzze and has an elaborate floor decorated exotic animals in medallions and two beautiful peacocks. It was dated to 561-562 and it is regarded an extraordinary piece of Justinian era mosaic art. A lesser known mosaic of a church was also uncovered during military operations in the summer of 1917 at Umm Jerar, south of Gaza. Two floors have many similarities in design. In the Barnea district of the port of Ashkelon two large Byzantine churches were unearthed. In the first only the remains of glass tesserae prove that its walls were decorated with mosaics while in the other one an almost intact geometric floor survived with three inscriptions dating to years 493 and 498. Lebanon As part of ancient region of Syria, present-day Lebanon shared the same great tradition in Roman and Byzantine mosaic art as neighbouring areas. In the recent past many important finds were brought to light in cities and churches all over the country. An important Byzantine mosaic collection was established in Beiteddine Palace, mostly from discoveries in the coastal town of Jiyyeh (ancient Porphyrion). They date from the 5-6th centuries. The designs are often geometric and stylized but there are also interesting depictions of animals, including leopards, gazelles, lions, hares and birds, as well as religious figures. A big geometric mosaic floor was unearthed in the Church of St John the Baptist in Byblos. File:Beiteddine - mosa√Øque l√©opard.jpgFifth c. Mosaic of a leopard at the Beiteddine Palace.

Syria Syria had a high status and leadership in the period of Byzantines, in which many of its cities had schools of mosaic art and wonderful murals which decorated many of the very large buildings, churches and cathedrals across Syria, including one of the largest mosaics in the world founded in Taybat al-Imam and hundreds of wonderful paintings in different areas where many of them are kept in museums, such as the mosaics of Hama museum including the theater and the musical band of Maryamin, and the mosaics stored in Maarrat al-Nu'man museum, including the birth of Hercules which was founded in Homs. Other notable artworks are located in the city of Shahba, the native hamlet of the Emperor Philip the Arab, and in the city of Apamea, the ancient city of Antioch (in modern-day Turkey) and in the region of Hauran.

File:Diana discovered by Actaeon.jpgDiana discovered at bath by Actaeon; mosaic in As-Suwayda, Syria The Umayyad era The Arab conquest of the Middle East in the 7th century did not break off the art of mosaic making. Arabs learned and accepted the craft as their own and carried on the classical tradition. During the Umayyad era Christianity retained its importance, churches were built and repaired and some of the most important mosaics of the Christian East were made during the 8th century when the region was under Islamic rule. The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now Umm ar-Rasas) were made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region (including Kastron Mefaa, Philadelphia, Madaba, Esbounta, Belemounta, Areopolis, Charac Moaba, Jerusalem, Nablus, Caesarea and Gaza). The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) \\"Church of Bishop Sergius.\\" Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration. The mosaic floors of the Acropolis Church at Ma‚Äôin (ancient Belemounta), dated by an inscription to 719‚Äì20 include depictions of 11 buildings representing cities in the Holy Land, as identified by Greek toponyms. All figures were damaged by iconoclasts and carefully replaced with various motifs. The last great mosaics in Madaba were made in 767 in the Church of the Virgin Mary (discovered in 1887). It is a masterpiece of the geometric style with a Greek inscription in the central medallion. With the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750 the Middle East went through deep cultural changes. No great mosaics were made after the end of the 8th century and the majority of churches gradually fell into disrepair and were eventually destroyed. The tradition of mosaic making died out among the Christians and also in the Islamic community.

MIKE 21C was developed by DHI. MIKE 21C uses curvilinear finite difference grids. Simulated processes with MIKE 21C include bank erosion, scouring and shoaling brought about by activities such as construction and dredging, seasonal fluctuations in flow, etc. Applications MIKE 21C can be used for designing protection schemes against bank erosion, evaluating measures to reduce or manage shoaling, analyzing alignments and dimensions of navigation channels for minimizing capital and maintenance dredging, predicting the impact of bridge, tunnel and pipeline crossings on river channel hydraulics and morphology, optimizing restoration plans for habitat environment in channel floodplain systems, designing monitoring networks based on morphological forecasting. Due to its accurate descriptions of the physical processes, MIKE 21C can simulate a braided river developing from a plane bed, which was illustrated by Enggrob & Tjerry (1998). Theory As most other models made by DHI, MIKE 21C applies an add-on concept in which the overall time-loop can contain processes to be simulated, selected by the user. In its basic form the model is a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model that can simulate dynamic as well as quasi-steady or steady-state hydrodynamic solutions. The hydrodynamic model solves the Saint- Venant equations in two dimensions with the water depth defined in cell centers and a staggered velocity field (internally the code solves the flux field, i.e. the water depth multiplied by the velocity vector) defined with direction as the local grid base vector. The model is computationally a parallel code (written in Fortran) with parallelizations in all modules, which allows for simulations of morphological developments on fine grids over long periods of time. The model is typically applied with as much 25,000 computational points over periods of several years or even decades. The most important secondary flow in rivers is the so-called helical flow, with its name derived from Helios (the Sun in Greek). The name helical is used because the flow arises as the water in the lower portions of the water column flowing towards the local center of curvature, and away from the local center of curvature along the water surface. This has only a minor impact on the hydrodynamics, usually only pronounced on a laboratory scale, but it has profound impacts on the sediment transport and morphology because the helical flow influences the otherwise zero transverse sediment component. MIKE 21C applies standard theory for the helical flow, which can be found in e.g. Rozowsky (1957). Standard helical flow theory provides a secondary flow velocity profile that is fully characterised by friction and the deviation angle between the main flow direction and the direction of the shear stress at the river bed. MIKE 21C uses the traditional division of sediment transport into bedload and suspended load, and the model can simulate both non-cohesive and cohesive sediment in a mixture. The bed-load model accounts for the impacts of secondary flow (bed shear stress direction) and local bed slope (gravity). Suspended load is calculated with an advection-dispersion equation for each fraction, which includes adaptation in time and space as well as the 2-dimensional depth-integrated effects of the 3-dimensional flow pattern through profile functions (Galappatti & Vreugdenhil, 1985).

It is administered by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro), and the card and fare collection systems are manufactured by Cubic Transportation Systems. Metro staff manage the web site and provide customer support functions.http://media.metro.net/board/Items/2016/06_june/201606_cac_tap_update.pdf Description The TAP is a blue, or orange for reduced fare, credit-card- sized contactless stored value smartcard which can hold a transit Pass or cash balance. The TAP card must be tapped on electronic readers to validate it when entering and transferring within the system. TAP readers are integrated in bus fareboxes,bus validators and standalone readers are located just outside the paid area of Metro Rail stations. Because Metro Rail has a mix of barrier free and faregated areas, it operates on a proof-of-payment system: as such, Metro's fare inspectors randomly check using a wireless handheld unit to make sure TAP users have validated their card. The cards may be \\"recharged\\" in person from ticket vending machines in Metro Rail stations, TAP Vendors, at Metro Customer Service Centers or online. The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at Customer Service Centers. The card costs $2 and is only available with a fare media product (such as a day pass or stored value). Cards can also be purchased on Metro buses(since 15 September 2014)for $2 plus stored value(which works like a debit card). TAP cards expire approximately 3‚Äì10 years from purchase. Currently most operators sell passes on the TAP web site, and Metro sells monthly, weekly, and day passes at rail ticket vending machines. Stored value (cash purse) can be added onto the TAP card at rail ticket vending machines, retail locations, and online. Non-Metro agencies may sell transfers on TAP cards, which can be read by Metro TAP readers. For non- Metro operators, TAP cards are sold at their administrative offices, TAP website, or customer service centers. There are some agencies in Southern California which do not (yet) accept the TAP card. Transit agencies have been allowed to transition onto TAP at their own pace, and it is not a requirement for receiving Metro funding or participation in interagency transfer agreements. History Prior to introduction of the TAP card, a magnetic stripe card called the Metrocard (not to be confused with the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority's card) was introduced in 1993 on Culver CityBus, with later expansion to Foothill Transit, Montebello Bus Lines, Norwalk Transit, and Santa Monica Big Blue Bus. The fare card only offered stored value, and was compatible with GFI Genfare fareboxes used by these systems. The program was dubbed the Universal Fare System, or UFS, for future implementation throughout Los Angeles County. Later innovations expanded the magnetic stripe technology for monthly and day passes. TAP was initially tested by UCLA students, select businesses (A-TAP and B-TAP program) and Metro staff. In October 2007, TAP had a two-month test program limited to the first 2,000 customers. TAP was rolled out to the general public in February 2008 as a free upgrade for monthly pass customers, and on February 11, 2008, to replace the stored value Metrocards for Culver CityBus riders. Santa Monica Big Blue Bus opted out of the Universal Fare System program entirely and in 2006 converted their existing regional Metrocards to operate only within their system. Other agencies, such as Foothill Transit and Norwalk Transit, transitioned from Metrocard to TAP in 2009. On March 15, 2009, TAP's scope was expanded to Metro 24-hour passes, which are now only sold on TAP, at Ticket Vending Machines and TAP Vendors (although paper 24-hour passes were still able to be purchased at ticket vending machines until 2012). TAP cards were issued for seniors and the disabled beginning January 2009, and all senior and disabled riders were required to obtain TAP cards by December 2010. In August 2011, all Metro multi-day passes were converted to TAP cards. The existing monthly and weekly passes were converted into 30 and 7 day passes, respectively, with the period beginning on the first tap after the pass is purchased. Effective September 2012, all Metro Rail fares are sold on TAP, and paper tickets are no longer sold, with the exception of municipal transfers, which have since also been moved to TAP. All EZ transit passes have been converted to TAP. The fee for obtaining a TAP card is $2. Between June 19, 2013 and June 18, 2014 the faregates at 40 Metro stations were \\"latched\\" so they open only with a valid TAP card. To make the faregate system possible, other agencies use TAP-compatible fare media in 2018. Effective July 15, 2018, paper-issued interagency transfers as well as temporary TAP cards used to transfer to Metro Rail have been discontinued. Passengers must use a TAP card with Stored Value to board the first bus or the Metro Rail/Orange/Silver Line, then use the TAP card to transfer to another bus or Metro Rail/Orange/Silver Line to complete the trip. On Metro buses and rail lines, transfers are free for up to two hours. Agencies using TAP A TAP validator at a Metro station =Current= TAP is accepted on these services as of July 1, 2015: * Metro Bus * Metro Busway * Metro Rail * Metro Bike Share * Access Services * Antelope Valley Transit Authority * Baldwin Park Transit * Beach Cities Transit * Big Blue Bus (Santa Monica) * Burbank Bus * Carson Circuit Transit System * City of Santa Clarita Transit * Compton Renaissance Transit * Culver City Bus * FlyAwayhttp://www.lawa.org/newsContentbs.aspx?ID=2428 * Foothill Transit * GTrans (Gardena) * Glendale Beeline * Huntington Park COMBI * LADOT Commuter Express * LADOT DASH * Long Beach Transit * Los Angeles County Department of Public Works * Montebello Bus Lines * Monterey Park Spirit Bus * Norwalk Transit * Palos Verdes Peninsula Transit Authority * Pasadena Transit * Torrance Transit While not all of the region's transit agencies use TAP for fare collection, all agencies that offer interagency transfers issue them on TAP-compatible paper tickets. The ticket allows passengers to ride one additional Metro Bus, Metro Rail, or municipal bus line. =Partial= Metrolink Metrolink does not use TAP for fare collection and has no plans to do so, but the agency does use TAP-capable paper fare media. The TAP functionality is only enabled on one-way, round trip, 7 day, weekend and monthly passes issued for trips to or from a Los Angeles County destination, allowing passengers to transfer to connecting services. As of January 2020, Metrolink no longer has TAP enabled tickets to transfer to Metro rail riders scan the QR code on the ticket at Metro rail turnstiles and show ticket on buses. Orange County Transportation Authority While the Orange County Transportation Authority does not use TAP, the agency will honor TAP cards when passengers board lines that directly serve Los Angeles County (lines 1, 30, 38, 42, 46, 50, 60, 560, 701, and 721) and at bus stops where OCTA buses directly connect with Metro buses.

This act required that all schools within the state of Indiana be organized into single unit school corporations of at least one thousand students in attendance. The only existing and occupied building eliminated during the reorganization process was the school at Lucerne, which was closed in 1966 when the Jr.-Sr. High School building was completed and occupied. The corporation also has one elementary building, which, along with the Jr.-Sr. High School, is located in Royal Center. Pioneer School Corporation was originally known as Royal Center High School and the school mascot was a Bulldog. The organizational meeting for the Board of Trustees was called by Chalmer Condon, then Superintendent of Cass County Schools, on January 2, 1963. The members of the first Board of Trustees of the Pioneer Regional School Corporation were Paul Harrison, President; H.W. Roller, Vice-President; Roger Ide, Secretary; Harold Wilson, Treasurer; and Donald Heiny, Assistant Secretary. The corporation's first superintendent was Ralph L.

When Cao Cao's army arrived at Chencang (Èô≥ÂÄâ; present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi) and was about to pass through Wudu (Ê≠¶ÈÉΩ; around present-day Longnan, Gansu), the Di tribes in the area blocked their path, so Cao Cao sent Zhang He, Zhu Ling and others to attack the Di and clear the way.

Robbins Landon, The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn, London: Universal Edition & Rockliff (1955): 687. It is in four movements: #Allegro, #Un poco adagio cantabile in D major, #Menuetto e Trio, #Presto assai, The opening movement begins with a hammerstroke and a dotted- rhythm fanfare of repeated notes which serves as the first theme for the sonata-form movement. The line between the development and recapitulation is blurred by the reappearance of the dotted-rhythm in G minor (the home tonic but the wrong mode) followed by standard recapitulation of the second theme group. The first theme is finally resolved in the concluding coda.A. Peter Brown, The Symphonic Repertoire, 2 volumes. Bloomington and London: Indiana University Press (2002): 2:139‚Äì143. The slow movement is a theme with four variations in invertible counterpoint. Through the third variation, each appearance of the ternary theme with winds appearing only in the middle section framed by muted strings in the outer sections. In the second outer section, the theme in two voices is inverted. Also, through each of the first three variations the surface rhythms are accelerating from eighth notes to sixteenth notes to triplet-sixteenths to thirty-seconds. The fourth variation varies from this pattern in that it is fully scored for the entire variation and serves as a recapitulation for the movement. What follows is a coda where the theme slowly dies away. The \\"Minuetto al Roverso\\" is the reason this symphony is sometimes called \\"The Palindrome\\": the second part of the Minuet is the same as the first but backwards, and the Trio is also written in this way.Antony Hodgson, The Music of Joseph Haydn: The Symphonies, London: The Tantivy Press (1976): 74.Mark Evan Bonds, \\"Haydn's 'Cours complet de la composition' and the Sturm und Drang\\", in Haydn Studies, ed.

The school's mascot is the Rough Rider. School colors are brown and white, with gold sometimes used as an accentuating third color. During the 2016-2017 academic year, the high school was attended by 485 students, making it one of the smaller public high schools in the Lehigh Valley region. Catasauqua High School is the only high school in the Catasauqua Area School District. The school district also includes Catasauqua Middle School, which serves grades 5 through 8, and Francis H. Sheckler Elementary School, which serves kindergarten through grade 4. Although Catasauqua High School is part of the Catasauqua Area School District and serves the residents of Catasauqua, Pennsylvania, the school building is physically located in the city and county of Northampton. The previous high school building, situated in Catasauqua proper, is now the middle school building. The previous middle school building, which was in fact the original high school building, is currently home to the Lehigh Valley Christian High School.

The game is not sanctioned and does not count as a win or loss for official standings with regard to playoff consideration within the PIAA. The game is always considered to be Homecoming for Catasauqua, regardless of whether the game is played at home or away. These two high schools from neighboring towns first played each other in 1925 and the game ended in a controversial victory for Catasauqua. A rematch was challenged by Northampton and scheduled for Thanksgiving Day to decide the outcome as that was the only available day on the calendar. Catasauqua won both games the first year. In 1926, once again the two schools met and again the game ended in a controversial victory, this time for Northampton. Catasauqua challenged a rematch and once again they met on Thanksgiving Day to decide the outcome. Northampton won both games the second year. Beginning in 1927, the game was agreed to be played on Thanksgiving Day from the onset of the season. A tradition was born and the game has been played every year since. Both schools and their respective communities have developed a bitter rivalry toward each other. For a number of years through 1968, the Catasauqua ‚Äì Northamption game was played on a neutral site (at Muhlenberg College). Beginning in 1969, the games were held alternately at the teams' home fields until 2013, when the game was again played at Muhlenberg. In the most recent game, in 2018, Northampton beat Catasauqua.

Garrott was killed during the Vicksburg Campaign before his commission as a brigadier general was confirmed by the Confederate Senate or delivered and became effective.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 597. Early life Garrott was born in either Anson County or Wake County, North Carolina in 1816. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and then studied law. In 1840, he moved to Marion, Alabama where he practiced law. Garrott was a member of the Whig Party and a Mason. Garrott was also an incorporator of the Marion and Alabama River Transportation Company and President of the Board of Trustees of Howard College. He was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 1845 and 1847. Garrott served as an elector for John C. Breckinridge's failed 1860 Presidential Election campaign. Alabama Governor Andrew B. Moore sent Garrott to North Carolina as a commissioner to enlist his home state's aid in joining the secession movement.Warner, Ezra J., Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders, Louisiana State University Press, 1959. Civil War When the Civil War began, Garrott formed the 20th Alabama Infantry Regiment, serving briefly as its lieutenant colonel) from September 16, 1861, to October 7, 1861, and thereafter as its colonel. The brigade was stationed in Mobile, Alabama during 1861 and 1862. Garrott's brigade was sent to Mississippi as part of General Edward D. Tracy's brigade. Garrott took part in the Battle of Port Gibson and the Battle of Champion's Hill. Garrott was killed by a Union sharpshooter on June 17, 1863, shortly before being promoted to brigadier general. His commission to rank from May 28, 1863, was received at headquarters after his death. Because of his death, his posthumous appointment was not confirmed by the Confederate Senate. According to Warner's footnote, Garrott was buried under the window of a friend's {Finney} house in Vicksburg and remains never moved {letter from Garrott's wife}. What happened to Garrott was the following: A Confederate undertaker's list/map of CS burials in Vicksburg was lost-although partially found years later. This list reported a \\"Colonel Garnet\\" of the 20th Alabama-although gravesite plot unknown. Apparently, Garrott was reburied in Vicksburg's Cedar Hill/Confederate Cemetery; however due to the misspelling of his surname and incorrect rank-his Generals commission was received after his death-apparently lead to reporting that his remains were not moved from his first burial place. Thus the NPS listing for Garrott now has his correct rank/surname but no grave number.NPS Listing of CS graves at Vicksburg A stone marker for him stands in Soldiers Rest Confederate Cemetery, ironically located in the Cedar Hill (Old Vicksburg City) Cemetery.Marion Military Institute Archives: Marion‚Äôs Two Confederate Generals (One, Superintendent of The Citadel) Legacy Fort Garrott near Vicksburg was named for him.

The farm is run by the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems, which is part of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems, and has existed in its current form since 2000. It hosts a variety of crops and fruits, as well as some animals and composting facilities. Several academic programs allow the students to use the farm for research and teaching.  History  The farm, located on traditional Musqueam First Nations territory, has been part of UBC since 1915. However, the farm of 1915 was not located at its current position, but reached from the Nitobe Memorial Garden to the Thunderbird Stadium. In 1970 the farm moved closer to its current position at Wesbrook Place. During the 1990s activity on the agricultural area at the south end of campus declined, and in 1997 the area was declared a Future Housing Reserve. A student-initiated program, supported by the Faculties of Science and Forestry, began in 1999 to advocate for the revival of the UBC Farm. 2008 saw the announcement of plans to reduce the size of the farm or move it somewhere else. This caused the Alma Mater Society club Friends of the UBC Farm to start a \\"Save the Farm\\" campaign and advocate for the conservation of the farm. This campaign caused a shift in policy, and on December 1, 2009, UBC's Board of Governors stated that the site of the UBC Farm would no longer be considered a housing reserve. In 2011 the area was declared a \\"Green Academic\\" zone, which \\"will be kept primarily as open areas to support land-based teaching, research and community engagement\\".  Farm facilities and mission  = Farm facilities = The farm consists of two small buildings, which can serve a variety of purposes, including as classroom, office, kitchen, storage, and processing areas, and it is surrounded by a coastal hemlock forest. Two tractors and other tools are stored in several sheds on site, and two glass greenhouses and three polytunnels offer to extend the seasons and further spread the crops. A 300 m3 composting facility can process the farm's and other local produce wholesalers' organic waste and turn it into soil fertilizer. Two trailers offer staff accommodation to take care of the animals 24 hours a day. The farm includes a wide range of crops and livestock, which represent the agricultural possibilities of the Pacific northwest. Vancouver's moderate maritime climate allows cultivation of certain crops year round. Over 70 different kind of apples grow in the heritage orchard, and the farm also features grapes, blueberries, raspberries, hops, and truffles. The farm normally hosts some free-range poultry and honeybee colonies and has occasionally been a seasonal home for cattle. It provides a habitat for \\"a range of birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles not found elsewhere in the city\\". = Farm mission = The farm's main objective is to offer UBC a wider arrange of possibilities to research and create more sustainable and healthy communities through interdisciplinary cooperation and hands-on learning. It aims to promote a better understanding of the relationship between society and ecological systems. Through sharing knowledge with the local community, it raises awareness about a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. = Farmers' markets and other events = From June through October, UBC Farm offers two farmers' markets every week, where farm produce is sold. On Saturdays the market is held at the UBC Farm, and on Wednesdays the produce is sold at UBC's Vancouver campus. Some produce is also sold to local restaurants, and a volunteer student organization provides a delivery service of the farm's produce. The farm occasionally hosts private events like weddings, birthday parties, and music events.  Teaching programs  = Curricular activities = UBC Farm provides students with resources to pursue land-based, hands-on research and learning. Several UBC degree programs cooperate with the farm, in particular the Faculty of Land and Foods Systems, and include the farm in many of their curricular activities. In 2010, 2,500 students from eight faculties participated in curricular activities based at the farm. The farm is also part of UBC's Campus as Living Lab initiative, which was introduced with UBC's commitment to sustainability. = Indigenous teaching = As part of Vancouver's Native Health Society (VNHS) project, a garden and a weekly community kitchen for Aboriginal people in Vancouver was established in 2005. The goal is to provide healthy food for Aboriginal people and to give elderly and young Aboriginals a space to interact and share knowledge. The native Musqueam community has a space to grow food and medicinal plants. = Children's Learning Garden = The farm also features a Children's Learning Garden, which offers Farm Discovery Tours for \\"students from pre-kindergarten through secondary school\\" during the school year, and Farm Wonders camps over spring break and in the summer. The garden also hosts the Intergenerational Landed Learning Project, a program run by the UBC Faculty of Education, which partners elementary students, seniors, and other community volunteers to grow food, cook, and learn together throughout the school year.  Future plans for UBC Farm  = Construction of two new buildings = Demand for bigger facilities at the UBC Farm has grown since 2000, and in 2012 it was announced that two new buildings are scheduled for construction at the farm site. The new buildings would include a replacement for the current Farm Centre and a residential sustainability college. The new centre is set to \\"include classrooms, dry and wet labs, offices, kitchens, processing space, an area for the farmer's market, a small retail space, caf√© and student study spaces\\", while the college is to offer residential space for students to engage in \\"practical participation at the Farm\\". = Possible AMS brewery = In 2013 the AMS announced that plans for a student-run brewery in the new Student Union Building (SUB), set to open in 2014, had been cancelled for financial reasons. Instead of incorporating the brewery in the new SUB, plans were made to build a commercial student-run brewery at the UBC Farm. However, in UBC's Land Use Plan, no space is assigned to accommodate a brewery on the farm's area.

It also broadcast a wide array of children's shows, such as Capit√°n Kapote and Esperando a Pap√° (\\"Waiting for Daddy\\"), and American imports such as Bonanza, Combat! and The Fugitive. In 1989, LT 84 became one of the founding members of Televisi√≥n Federal (Telefe), resulting in higher quality local programs. In 2007, Canal Cinco's tower collapsed in a storm that also took down its competitor on channel 3: the next day, channel 5 was back and operating at 50% power. Three years later, both stations moved to the site already used by TV P√∫blica to broadcast to Rosario. Programming Canal Cinco offers a variety of local programs, such as local newscasts branded as Telefe Noticias, as well as locally produced programs with a regional focus, agricultural shows such as Tiempo de campo, and sports talk programs such as F√∫tbol sin trampas. Since 1994, the channel offers a daily mini-program called Rosario, Patrimonio de Todos (\\"Rosario, People's Heritage\\"). The show offers a retrospective to the city's history and its importance in the building of Argentina. Digital television Canal Cinco was the first Telefe station in interior Argentina to broadcast in HD full-time, doing so on July 23, 2014. Test transmissions began in October 2012 with a local event, which aired both on broadcast in HD and on cable.

The method has produced several important classes of filter including the Butterworth filter, the Chebyshev filter and the Elliptic filter. It was originally intended to be applied to the design of passive linear analogue filters but its results can also be applied to implementations in active filters and digital filters. The essence of the method is to obtain the component values of the filter from a given rational function representing the desired transfer function. Description of method The method can be viewed as the inverse problem of network analysis. Network analysis starts with a network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. Network synthesis on the other hand, starts with a desired response and its methods produce a network that outputs, or approximates to, that response. Network synthesis was originally intended to produce filters of the kind formerly described as wave filters but now usually just called filters. That is, filters whose purpose is to pass waves of certain frequencies while rejecting waves of other frequencies. Network synthesis starts out with a specification for the transfer function of the filter, H(s), as a function of complex frequency, s. This is used to generate an expression for the input impedance of the filter (the driving point impedance) which then, by a process of continued fraction or partial fraction expansions results in the required values of the filter components. In a digital implementation of a filter, H(s) can be implemented directly.Matthaei, pp83-84 The advantages of the method are best understood by comparing it to the filter design methodology that was used before it, the image method. The image method considers the characteristics of an individual filter section in an infinite chain (ladder topology) of identical sections. The filters produced by this method suffer from inaccuracies due to the theoretical termination impedance, the image impedance, not generally being equal to the actual termination impedance. With network synthesis filters, the terminations are included in the design from the start. The image method also requires a certain amount of experience on the part of the designer. The designer must first decide how many sections and of what type should be used, and then after calculation, will obtain the transfer function of the filter. This may not be what is required and there can be a number of iterations. The network synthesis method, on the other hand, starts out with the required function and generates as output the sections needed to build the corresponding filter. In general, the sections of a network synthesis filter are of identical topology (usually the simplest ladder type) but different component values are used in each section. By contrast, the structure of an image filter has identical values at each section, as a consequence of the infinite chain approach, but may vary the topology from section to section to achieve various desirable characteristics. Both methods make use of low-pass prototype filters followed by frequency transformations and impedance scaling to arrive at the final desired filter. Important filter classes The class of a filter refers to the class of polynomials from which the filter is mathematically derived. The order of the filter is the number of filter elements present in the filter's ladder implementation. Generally speaking, the higher the order of the filter, the steeper the cut-off transition between passband and stopband. Filters are often named after the mathematician or mathematics on which they are based rather than the discoverer or inventor of the filter. =Butterworth filter= Butterworth filters are described as maximally flat, meaning that the response in the frequency domain is the smoothest possible curve of any class of filter of the equivalent order.Matthaei et al., pp85-108 The Butterworth class of filter was first described in a 1930 paper by the British engineer Stephen Butterworth after whom it is named. The filter response is described by Butterworth polynomials, also due to Butterworth.Butterworth, S, \\"On the Theory of Filter Amplifiers\\", Wireless Engineer, vol. 7, 1930, pp. 536-541. =Chebyshev filter= A Chebyshev filter has a faster cut-off transition than a Butterworth, but at the expense of there being ripples in the frequency response of the passband. There is a compromise to be had between the maximum allowed attenuation in the passband and the steepness of the cut-off response. This is also sometimes called a type I Chebyshev, the type 2 being a filter with no ripple in the passband but ripples in the stopband. The filter is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev whose Chebyshev polynomials are used in the derivation of the transfer function. =Cauer filter= Cauer filters have equal maximum ripple in the passband and the stopband. The Cauer filter has a faster transition from the passband to the stopband than any other class of network synthesis filter. The term Cauer filter can be used interchangeably with elliptical filter, but the general case of elliptical filters can have unequal ripples in the passband and stopband. An elliptical filter in the limit of zero ripple in the passband is identical to a Chebyshev Type 2 filter. An elliptical filter in the limit of zero ripple in the stopband is identical to a Chebyshev Type 1 filter. An elliptical filter in the limit of zero ripple in both passbands is identical to a Butterworth filter. The filter is named after Wilhelm Cauer and the transfer function is based on elliptic rational functions.Mathaei, p95 Cauer-type filters use generalized continued fractions. =Bessel filter= The Bessel filter has a maximally flat time- delay (group delay) over its passband. This gives the filter a linear phase response and results in it passing waveforms with minimal distortion. The Bessel filter has minimal distortion in the time domain due to the phase response with frequency as opposed to the Butterworth filter which has minimal distortion in the frequency domain due to the attenuation response with frequency. The Bessel filter is named after Friedrich Bessel and the transfer function is based on Bessel polynomials.Matthaei, pp108-113 Driving point impedance Low-pass filter implemented as a ladder (Cauer) topology The driving point impedance is a mathematical representation of the input impedance of a filter in the frequency domain using one of a number of notations such as Laplace transform (s-domain) or Fourier transform (jœâ- domain). Treating it as a one-port network, the expression is expanded using continued fraction or partial fraction expansions. The resulting expansion is transformed into a network (usually a ladder network) of electrical elements. Taking an output from the end of this network, so realised, will transform it into a two-port network filter with the desired transfer function.E. Cauer, p4 Not every possible mathematical function for driving point impedance can be realised using real electrical components. Wilhelm Cauer (following on from R. M. FosterFoster, R M, \\"A Reactance Theorem\\", Bell System Technical Journal, vol 3, pp259-267, 1924.) did much of the early work on what mathematical functions could be realised and in which filter topologies. The ubiquitous ladder topology of filter design is named after Cauer.E. Cauer, p1 There are a number of canonical forms of driving point impedance that can be used to express all (except the simplest) realisable impedances. The most well known ones are;Darlington, S, \\"A history of network synthesis and filter theory for circuits composed of resistors, inductors, and capacitors\\", IEEE Trans. Circuits and Systems, vol 31, p6, 1984. *Cauer's first form of driving point impedance consists of a ladder of shunt capacitors and series inductors and is most useful for low-pass filters. *Cauer's second form of driving point impedance consists of a ladder of series capacitors and shunt inductors and is most useful for high-pass filters. * Foster's first form of driving point impedance consists of parallel connected LC resonators (series LC circuits) and is most useful for band-pass filters. * Foster's second form of driving point impedance consists of series connected LC anti-resonators (parallel LC circuits) and is most useful for band-stop filters. Further theoretical work on realizable filters in terms of a given rational function as transfer function was done by Otto Brune in 1931Otto Brune (1931) \\"Synthesis of a finite two-terminal network whose driving-point impedance is a prescribed function of frequency\\", MIT Journal of Mathematics and Physics, Vol 10, pp 191‚Äì236 and Richard Duffin with Raoul Bott in 1949.Richard Duffin & Raoul Bott, \\"Impedance synthesis without the use of transformers\\", Journal of Applied Physics 20:816 The work was summarized in 2010 by John H. Hubbard.John H. Hubbard (2010) \\"The Bott-Duffin Synthesis of Electrical Circuits\\", pp 33 to 40 in A Celebration of the Mathematical Legacy of Raoul Bott, P. Robert Kotiuga editor, CRM Proceedings and Lecture Notes #50, American Mathematical Society When a transfer function is specified as a positive-real function (the set of positive real numbers is invariant under the transfer function), then a network of passive components (resistors, inductors, and capacitors) can be designed with that transfer function. Prototype filters : Prototype filters are used to make the process of filter design less labour-intensive. The prototype is usually designed to be a low-pass filter of unity nominal impedance and unity cut-off frequency, although other schemes are possible. The full design calculations from the relevant mathematical functions and polynomials are carried out only once. The actual filter required is obtained by a process of scaling and transforming the prototype.Matthaei, p83 Values of prototype elements are published in tables, one of the first being due to Sidney Darlington.Darlington, S, \\"Synthesis of Reactance 4-Poles Which Produce Prescribed Insertion Loss Characteristics\\", Jour. Math. and Phys., Vol 18, pp257-353, September 1939. Both modern computing power and the practice of directly implementing filter transfer functions in the digital domain have largely rendered this practice obsolete. A different prototype is required for each order of filter in each class. For those classes in which there is attenuation ripple, a different prototype is required for each value of ripple. The same prototype may be used to produce filters which have a different bandform from the prototype. For instance low-pass, high-pass, band- pass and band-stop filters can all be produced from the same prototype.See Matthaei for examples.

In 1990, in a slap at Roemer, senators removed Bares as president and returned Nunez to the post. From 1988 to 1990, Nunez nonetheless held the title of Senate President Pro Tempore.

He was the driving force behind construction of the Crescent City Connection, Interstate 510, and the West Bank Expressway. In 1986, Nunez was among fourteen candidates in the primary for the United States Senate seat vacated by the retiring Russell B. Long. He polled 69,855 (5.9 percent), a distant third-place finish. Long's successor was his fellow Democrat, U.S. Representative John Breaux of Louisiana's 7th congressional district, who defeated the Republican choice, Henson Moore of Louisiana's 6th congressional district, in a general election showdown.Louisiana Secretary of State, Primary election returns, September 27, 1986 After a month of consideration, Nunez endorsed Breaux over Moore.\\"Nunez indicates he'll back Breaux\\", Minden Press- Herald, October 23, 1986, p. 3A In 1988, Nunez became the subject of national attention when he met with LSU Chancellor James Wharton regarding the readmission to the university graduate school of a student who is one of Nunez's female relatives. The student, whose identity was not revealed, had been accused of plagiarism and was required to withdraw from LSU for a semester. However, the graduate council required her to withdraw for two years. Dr. Wharton sided with the one-semester suspension and readmitted the student. He thereafter resigned as chancellor and returned to the classroom as a tenured professor of chemistry. Senator Nunez's last election victory occurred on October 19, 1991, when he defeated fellow Democrat Mary B. Faucheux, 29,553 (68.2 percent) to 13,793 (31.8 percent). In the 1987 nonpartisan blanket primary, Nunez faced tougher competition, but he prevailed with 23,370 votes (50.7 percent) over six opponents, including the runner-up and only Republican in the field, Lynn Dean, an industrialist from Braithwaite in Plaquemines Parish, who drew 11,916 ballots (25.8 percent). Early in 1995, Nunez removed state Senator Foster Campbell of Bossier Parish, much later a candidate for governor and the United States Senate, from the chairmanship of a committee established to consider a proposed oil and natural gas processing tax on foreign energy imports. Campbell criticized Nunez: \\"As a legislator for thirty years, he supported billions of dollars in new taxes, including taxes on food, drugs, and utilities. He finally found a tax he doesn't like.\\" Nunez replied that the processing tax could cost the state critically needed jobs.\\"Campbell blames oil tax for ousting\\", Minden Press-Herald, January 6, 1995, p. 1. In the 1995 primary, Lynn Dean led Nunez, 19,794 (46.4 percent) to 15,137 (35.5 percent). A third candidate, Democrat Gilbert Andry, held the remaining 7,773 (18.2 percent). In the general election Dean trumped Nunez, 23,939 (53.7 percent) to 20,682 (46.3 percent) despite Andry's enthusiastic endorsement of Nunez. In that same election Republican Mike Foster won the governorship over the African-American Democrat Cleo Fields. Nunez was one of several pro-gambling legislators who were defeated or forced to retire following the 1995 legislative session. Two of Nunez' most prominent Senate colleagues, Armand Brinkhaus of Sunset in St. Landry Parish and Sixty Rayburn of Bogalusa in Washington Parish, lost re-election bids, while Senators Larry Bankston of Baton Rouge and Gerry Hinton of Slidell stood down. Also failing in his re-election bid was Rep. Raymond Lalonde of Sunset, the author of the 1992 bill which allowed for a land-based casino to operate in New Orleans. Senator Dean served two terms and was succeeded in 2004 by the Republican, later Democrat, Walter Boasso. As a Democrat, Boasso finished a distant second to Republican Bobby Jindal in the 2007 governor's race, as Jindal easily captured the requisite majority n the primary to avoid a runoff., In 2004, Nunez, at seventy-four, pondered entering the race to choose a successor to the retiring U.S. Representative Billy Tauzin in Louisiana's 3rd congressional district, but he never entered the race, ultimately won by the Democrat Charlie Melancon. Tauzin's second wife, Cecile, served as a legislative aide to Nunez while she was a student at LSU in Baton Rouge. In 2006, Nunez was among campaign contributors to both Melancon and the since convicted Democratic U.S. Representative William Jefferson of Louisiana's 2nd congressional district. Later years and legacy Long after his legislative service, Nunez was a member of the board of commissioners of the Port of New Orleans. He operated an insurance agency. Nunez and his Senate successor and former rival, Lynn Dean, were honorary members of the Nunez Community College Foundation board of directors in Chalmette. The college is named for Nunez's late wife, Elaine P. Nunez.\\"About Nunez\\" , Nunez Community College website. On January 30, 2010, Nunez was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield, along with the late Charlton Lyons and William \\"Billy\\" Nungesser, sitting U.S. Representative Rodney Alexander, and former State Senator Randy Ewing. Nunez died in 2012 at the age of eighty-one of complications of Parkinson's disease and pneumonia.Death of Sammy Nunez The Roman Catholic Nunez was living in Plaquemines Parish at the time of his death in New Orleans. He was survived by his second wife, Cynthia Wall Nunez; two nieces, Caroline Grace Watkins and Christie Lee Nunez, and a nephew, Hillary Nunez. Interment was at St. Bernard Memorial Gardens in Chalmette. Pallbearers included his nephew Hillary Nunez and current Louisiana State Senate President John Alario, former state Senator Hank Lauricella, former state Representative Kenneth L. Odinet Sr., St. Bernard Parish District Attorney Jack Rowley, and former Jefferson Parish District Attorney John Mamoulides.

Early life Michael Shepherd was born on 30 July 1923 in Cardiff of a Jewish family with its roots in Odessa and Poland. He attended Cardiff High School and pursued his medical studies at the Medical School of Oxford University and the Radcliffe Infirmary. He was there influenced by the teaching of John Ryle, Professor of Social Medicine. Whilst under his tutorage, Shepherd was asked to visit a patient in her own home in Cowley in order to learn about the socio-medical significance of cardiac invalidism. Through such examples, Shepherd discerned the potential value to psychiatry of systematic research into the social causes of mental disorder. After qualifying he went on to complete his house appointments, and also his National Service in the Royal Air Force.Gerald Russell, Michael Shepherd: Obituary, Psychiatric Bulletin, (1996), 20, 632-637 Career Shepherd began his psychiatric career at The Maudsley Hospital in 1947. In 1954 he obtained his Doctorate in Medicine from Oxford University, his thesis being a study of the pattern of major psychoses in the county of Buckinghamshire during two periods, 1931‚Äì33 and 1945-47. In 1956 he joined the staff of the Institute of Psychiatry as a Senior Lecturer, and then in 1961 he was appointed to the Institute's Readership in Psychiatry. In 1967 he had conferred on him a personal chair of epidemiological psychiatry, the first of its kind in the world. He became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1970 and a Foundation Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1971. He established the General Practice Research Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry in the late 1950s and continued to direct its activities until his retirement in 1988. He was also the founder editor of the journal Psychological Medicine and he was appointed a CBE in 1989. During his career he also became a Fellow of both the American Public Health Association and the American Psychological Association. Shepherd was heavily influenced during his early years at The Maudsley by Aubrey Lewis, who taught that the precise and well-organised collection of social data should become a new activity for the psychiatrist rather than limiting himself to the clinical study of the individual patient. Shepherd's close working relationship with Lewis later resulted in a careful documentation of Lewis' legacies to psychiatry in his remarkable biographies. With the exception of one year's attachment to the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, in 1955-56,Whilst in the US, Shepherd visited several centres obtaining material for a wide-ranging and critical survey of American psychiatry. Shepherd remained at The Maudsley for the entire duration of his professional career. =Role of GPs in the treatment of psychiatric illness= One of his outstanding contributions was to focus attention on the role of the NHS general practitioner in the treatment of patients with minor psychiatric illness. This was an important facet of the General Practice Research Unit which he established under the auspices of the Department of Health and Social Security. In 1986 the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Security wrote: \\"Within the structure of the National Health Service, the medical responsibility for the care of (emotionally disturbed) patients falls principally on the general practitioner.\\"Acheson, E. D. (1986) Introduction. In Mental Illness in Primary Care Settings, (eds M. Shepherd. G. Wilkinson & P. Williams), pp. 1-3. London: Tavistock. He went on to give credit to Shepherd for having carried out the work which clarified the nature and extent of these disorders. He further stated that the results of his enquiries had considerable implications for the organisation of medical services in Britain and for medical education. This was in stark contrast to the opinion two decades earlier when the medical correspondent of The Times (summarising an article in The Practitioner) stated that \\"the optimal management of neurotic patients by their general practitioners is not possible under the National Health Service\\" due to the time it would take. Shepherd's research and influence led to a much closer scrutiny of the needs of the numerous patients encountered in general practice with psychological disorders, and also resulted in an increase in the personnel composing the professional team in primary care.Horder, J. (1986) Professional team roles. In Mental Illness in Primary Care Settings (eds M. Shepherd. G. Wilkinson & P. Williams), pp. 87-92. London: Tavistock.The personnel composing the professional team in primary care including health visitors, community psychiatric nurses and visiting psychiatrists who helped general practitioners to care for these patients. Shepherd's seminal work Psychiatric Illness in General Practice (published in 1966) was the catalyst for this whole area of mental health research and policy for the best part of 30 years. It has been suggested that the resources available to the psychiatrists themselves remained stagnant and yet it is to them that virtually all the acute and serious cases of mental illness are referred straight away*Cooper, J. E. (1986) Discussant. In Mental Illness in Primary Care Settings, (eds M. Shepherd. G. Wilkinson & P. Williams), pp. 201-203. London: Tavistock. Also, Shepherd's insistence that the mental health services could only be enhanced by better training and better support for GPs rather than a proliferation of psychiatrists did not endear him to many of his psychiatric colleagues. However, not only has it been praised by the Chief Medical Officer, it has also been endorsed by a succession of World Health Organization declarations and is enshrined in a variety of Government strategy documents, including the 1992 publication, \\"The Health of the Nation\\". =Clinician= Shepherd's noted clinical study on the symptom of morbid jealousy early in his career led him to the conclusion that a medical opinion is of most value when the inter-personal and social aspects of a case are as closely understood as the narrower issue of diagnosis. He went on to apply these precepts to the full range of psychiatric disorders. Despite the value he gained from this study, Shepherd immediately became less concerned with the minutiae of clinical or experimental research and left the spadework to his team of research workers. As a clinician, Shepherd's style has been described as \\"unusual\\". He continued to be involved in clinical work until his retirement, although day-to-day management of his patients was delegated. His detachment was described as \\"Olympian\\" and was captured by a former patient in the lines of her book thus: \\"a tall dark pale man, with a chillingly superior glance and quellingly English voice made another appointment to see me. I knew that if anyone could discover the 'truth' it would be he alone or with his colleagues.\\"Frame, J. (1985) The Envoy from Mirror City: Autobiography 3, London: The Women's Press. =Tackling conceptual issues in psychiatry= One of Shepherd's legacies is the progress he made in helping the profession define and clarify difficult conceptual issues. He wrote extensively on the thorny problems of psychiatric classifications, psychopathology and the causation of mental illness. He was renowned for his \\"adroit dissection of poorly defined concepts\\" and for his success in clarifying them in his writings. In his 1987 article on the Formulation of New Research Strategies on Schizophrenia he concluded that the most persistent obstacle remained that of the reliable identification of schizophrenia. He went on to instigate the move towards obtaining international agreement for the definition of schizophrenia in communicable formShepherd, An experimental approach to psychiatric diagnosis, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, 210. Suppl, 1968 He also wrote extensively on the general psychopathology of Karl JaspersShepherd, 1990, Conceptual Issues in Psychological Medicine, London: Tavistock illuminating his belief that the main appeal of Jaspers' book as its breadth in extending the field of general psychopathology from the natural sciences, via phenomenology, to existentialist philosophy. In other words, the complex field of psychopathology had to be explored not only through biological science but through an analysis of what essentially belongs to Man and not man as a species of animal. Despite the seminal nature of Jasper's book, it is also recognized that it contains no clear definition of psychopathology, a weakness addressed by Shepherd who went about successfully converting English speaking psychiatrists to this work both through his essays and by instituting in the late 1950s a course of seminars on psychopathology for the benefit of doctors training in psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital. =Biographical essays= Shepherd used biographical essays as a vehicle to reveal his own personal philosophy and his leanings in psychiatry. Most notable are those centred on the achievements of people he admired including John Ryle, Aubrey Lewis and Jean Starobinski. In particular, Shepherd revered Lewis, whom he called a \\"Representative Psychiatrist\\".Shepherd, A representative psychiatrist: the career, contributions and legacies of Sir Aubrey Lewis, Psychological Medicine Supplement 10. Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1988 Kenneth Rawnsley suggested that he identified in his mentor the very qualities that he aspired to himself: intellectual integrity, scholarship, a vast range of knowledge and a cultivated capacity for juridical thought.Rawnsley, K., 1989, The Contribution of Michael Shepherd. In The Scope of Epidemiological Psychiatry: Essays in Honour of Michael Shepherd, pp. 509-521. London: Routledge. =Hammer of Psychoanalysis= Shepherd was described by colleagues as the \\"Hammer of Psychoanalysis\\", although he was not totally antipathetic towards its use. The conclusion he drew in his essay entitled \\"Sherlock Holmes and the case of Dr Freud\\",Shepherd, Sherlock Holmes and the Case of Dr Freud, 1985 where he compared the Sherlock Holmes method of drawing sweeping inferences from trivial clues with Freud's analytic method for examining the human mind, was that in both cases the method is viewed as essentially intuitive and devoid of logic. He coined the term neologism \\"mythod\\" to describe their method embedded in a myth, devoid of scientific value. Although he conceded reluctantly that psychoanalysis might still have some value as an arching metaphor, he demolished psychoanalysis as a scientific discipline. =Founding editor of Psychological Medicine= During Shepherd's career, he wrote and co- authored over 30 books and around 200 original articles including the five volumes of the Handbook of Psychiatry. However, perhaps his finest literary legacy was the establishment of what has been described as \\"arguably the finest psychiatric journal in the English-speaking world\\", the journal Psychological Medicine. He was the founding editor of Psychological Medicine from 1969 until 1993. He favoured the term \\"Psychological Medicine\\" over \\"Psychiatry\\" and he attached great importance to the title which he resurrected from the Journal of Psychological Medicine, first conceived by Forbes Winslow. He defined psychological medicine as including not only psychiatry but also the study of abnormal behaviour from the medical point of view. He aimed to concentrate on original high-quality work across the wide spectrum of both psychiatry and its allied disciplines and contributed extensively himself investing much time and care towards its success. According to his successor, Psychological Medicine was to become perhaps his greatest and most enduring creation set in an academic and research career which was already highly distinguished.Paykel, E. (1994) Michael Shepherd: Founding Editor. Editorial, Psychological Medicine. 24. 1. =Teacher= As a teacher he has been described as being without peer. He was an incorrigible opponent of the growing mass-production trends in contemporary university teaching with their emphasis on multiple-choice examination and impersonal teaching methods. He shunned didactic teaching but used the Socratic method of teaching by cross-questioning and challenging remaining devoted to the tutorial approach of which he was a \\"consummate practitioner\\". He jealously guarded his own opinions on controversial issues and remained enigmatic, provoking powerful exchanges of views. Former students of Shepherd have stated that he was a \\"challenging, provocative and inspiring teacher\\". He was renowned for his single-minded dedication to the scientific method and his incisive analytical skills, and hostility to vague speculation. His scepticism was not ideologically based and he was as likely to turn his critical gaze upon the contemporary enthusiasm for more detailed psychiatric classification as he was of the more established Freudian movement. He was served by generations of young research workers whose assistance helped him achieve the epidemiological studies for which he is renowned. Conversely, he was the inspiration behind their efforts and psychiatric careers that followed. A former student, Anthony Clare, has said that he was without equal in his record of selecting, nurturing and encouraging young men and women who would go on to fill senior academic posts in Britain and throughout the world. He was noted for identifying able and committed doctors in Africa, Asia, South America and Eastern Europe on his travels there. He often raised funds for their salaries, and took a great personal involvement in their research topics and apprenticeships securing them \\"a foot on the ladder of academic achievement\\" whilst helping to maintain The Maudsley's position as one of the world's great postgraduate centres for psychiatric teaching and research. A former researcher of Michael Shepherd wrote: \\"His students will always remember the spidery red ink which took apart their best efforts, and the equally spidery black ink with a small message attached to an article he thought relevant to the current problem, always signed MS.\\"Jenkins. R., Exploring the maze of the mind, The Guardian, 8 September 1995 Honours and awards Michael Shepherd received professional recognition with the presentation of: * Donald Reid Medal for Epidemiology in 1982. * Rema Lapouse Award of the American Public Health Association in 1983. He was honoured with: * CBE in 1989. * Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in 1990. * Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1995 shortly before his death. Family and personal life Shepherd was described as an entertaining companion whose breadth of knowledge was dazzling. He had a multitude of interests from ballet to rugby football, and took a great personal interest in the personal lives and backgrounds of those with whom he worked. He was a truly cultured man, well versed in literature and fluent in several languages. He was also a modest man, despite his pre-eminence in his field. Although described as being usually reticent in any exchange of personal emotion, he was also at heart a private and family man. He married Margaret Rock in 1947, a school teacher and together they had four children, two daughters, Catherine and Lucy, and two sons, Simon and Daniel, whom they raised in a large house on Alleyn Park Road in West Dulwich, south London, a relatively short distance from Maudsley Hospital. He was devastated by the death of his wife after a long illness in 1992 and withdrew for a period from public appearances. At the time of Michael Shepherd's death on 21 August 1995, he had two grandsons, his first granddaughter being born a few days after his death.

It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Mong Kok.  History  = Background = Baptist work in Hong Kong traces its roots from the first missionaries sent by the Triennial Convention to work with the Chinese. Due to the hostility to foreigners in China at that time, missionaries were forced to work in areas with significant Chinese population in territories outside of Chinese control. In 1835, Dr. and Mrs. William Dean begun work with the Chaozhou speaking Chinese in Bangkok, Thailand whereas the Revd. Jehu Lewis Shuck and his wife, Henrietta Shuck, started work among the Cantonese speaking Chinese in Portuguese ruled Macau.È¶ôÊ∏ØÊµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉËÅØÊúÉ: Êµ∏ÊúÉÊ≠∑Âè≤ (in Chinese)Hong Kong American Baptist Mission: Our Story = Initial mission work = With the cession of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom in 1842, the Shucks relocated to the colony in March of the same year and were joined later in the year by the Deans. The first chapel was established in 1842 in Queen's Road known as the Queen's Road Baptist Church. William H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of the Baptists, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p. 289 The Shucks also established a school for Chinese children where Henrietta served as director until her death in 1844. They were also joined by Issachar Jacox Roberts who preached extensively in the villages of Hong Kong, particularly in the village of Chek Chue (known today as Stanley). In the same year, Roberts relocated to Canton becoming the first European to reside outside the protected foreign factory as European compounds were known then. = Consolidation = Mission work among the Cantonese was temporarily halted in 1845 when Shuck returned to the United States although Chaozhou language work continued among transient emigrant coolies with the Deans who were later joined by John W. Johnson and William Ashmore in 1860. With the help of one of the first baptised convert, Chen Dui, a second Chaozhou congregation was established in Cheung Chau Island among the permanent residents. With the transfer of the Chaozhou mission to Shantou in 1861, the older congregation in Queen's Road closed down but the Cheung Chau congregation remained open, led by local Chinese leaders. Work was resumed among Cantonese speakers with the return of Johnson to Hong Kong in 1880 and by 1901, the Self-Governing Hong Kong Baptist Church (È¶ôÊ∏ØÊµ∏‰ø°Ëá™ÁêÜÊúÉ) was established. = BCHK established = On 27 March 1938, the Caine Road Baptist Church (È¶ôÊ∏ØÊµ∏‰ø°ÊïôÊúÉ), Cheung Chau Baptist Church (Èï∑Ê¥≤Êµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉ), Aberdeen Baptist Church (È¶ôÊ∏Ø‰ªîÊµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉ), together with the outreach points at Yau Ma Tei (Ê≤πÈ∫ªÂú∞‰ΩàÈÅìÊâÄ), Hung Hom (Á¥ÖÈã§‰ΩàÈÅìÊâÄ) and Kowloon City (‰πùÈæçÂüé‰ΩàÈÅìÊâÄ), together established the BCHK.È¶ôÊ∏ØÊµ∏‰ø°ÊúÉËÅØÊúÉ: Êµ∏ËÅØÊúÉ‰∫ãÂ∑•ÂõûÈ°ß (in Chinese) With the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, many refugees entered Hong Kong, including Christians from the Baptist churches in China. This helped in the expansion of the work of the BCHK. This included Chaozhou speaking Baptists affiliated with the mission established by William Dean who set up the Hong Kong Swatow Baptist Church in 1948. In 1954, Chaozhou speaking missionaries were sent by the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society at the request of local workers to help in the work and the Chaozhou speaking churches, collectively known as the Swatow Baptist Churches (later Shantou Baptist Churches) joined the BCHK.

From 1859 to 1905, a group of Methodists operated the Acton Camp Ground on just north of the town, at the corner of Southport and Acton roads. An agreement with the Indianapolis and Cincinnati Railroad provided good access to the camp grounds. Fire destroyed the camp buildings in 1864, but the association rebuilt them. Another fire in 1905 again destroyed the camp, but this time efforts to raise funds to rebuild fell short, and the land was sold. In the summer of 1980, a motorcyclist was struck by lightning while passing through Acton. When attempts by paramedics were unsuccessful in reviving the motorist, both the paramedics and witnesses claim a lady dressed in black and holding a bible, emerged and was able to revive the motorist by striking the motorist on the chest with a bible while speaking in tongues.

In July 1918, the German residents of Wilhelma were interned at Helouan, near Cairo in Egypt.Glenk et al., pp 67‚Äì72. They were returned to Palestine in January 1921.Glenk et al., pp 79‚Äì80. During the inter-war years the colony produced dairy goods and wine in collaboration with the German colony at Sarona.Glenk et al., pp 120‚Äì123. At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, Wilhelma had a population of 186 Christians, 36 Muslims and 1 Jew. By the 1931 census, there were 319 residents in 65 occupied houses, the population consisted of 231 Christians, 84 Muslims, and 4 Jews. During World War II, Wilhelma was transformed into an internment camp by the British Mandatory authorities where German settlers from Wilhelma and other localities such as Sarona as well as other enemy aliens (such as Hungarians and Italians) were concentrated and held.Frank Foerster, Mission im Heiligen Land: Der Jerusalems-Verein zu Berlin 1852-1945, G√ºtersloh: G√ºtersloher Verlags-Haus Mohn, 1991, (Missionswissenschaftliche Forschungen; [N.S.], 25), pp. 134 and 136.

Plot The play is set in Moldavanka, Odessa's Jewish Quarter in 1913. The plot revolves around the volatile relationship between neighborhood mob boss Benya Krik and his philandering, alcoholic father Mendel Krik. As the curtain rises, the Krik family awaits the arrival of Bobrinets, a wealthy suitor who wishes to marry Dvoira Krik. Although his daughter is already considered an old maid, Mendel Krik refuses to give her a dowry and insults Bobrinets, who leaves in a huff. Later, a weeping Nekhama Krik reminds her husband that the Jewish elders are about to bar him from the synagogue. However, Mendel mocks her as she laments having no grandchildren. Later, Mendel drinks up his family's money at the local saloon and begins an extramarital affair with Marusia Kholodenko, a 20-year-old Gentile. Despite their Russian Orthodox faith, the Kholodenko family is ecstatic to have a new source of money. Enraged by rumors that their father is about to disinherit them and elope to Bessarabia with Marusia, Benya and Lvovka Krik attack their father. Although Lvovka is severely beaten, Benya batters his father to a pulp and forbids him from leaving the house or Nekhama. In the aftermath, Benya and Lvovka arrange to Dvoira to receive a dowry to marry Bobrinets. They also pay for an abortion for the pregnant Marusia. At a party to celebrate Dvoira's engagement, Rabbi Ben Zkharia declares that \\"everything is as it should be\\" and proposes a toast to the sons of Mendel Krik. Reception According to Nathalie Babel Brown, > \\"Sunset premiered at the Baku Worker's Theatre on October 23, 1927 and > played in Odessa, Kiev, and the celebrated Moscow Art Theatre. The reviews, > however, were mixed. Some critics praised the play's 'powerful anti- > bourgeois stance and its interesting 'fathers and sons' theme. But in > Moscow, particularly, critics felt that the play's attitude toward the > bourgeoisie was contradictory and weak. Sunset closed, and was dropped from > the repertoire of the Moscow Art Theatre.The Complete Works of Isaac Babel, > pages 753-754. However, Sunset continued to have many admirers. In a 1928 letter to his White emigre father, Boris Pasternak wrote, \\"Yesterday, I read Sunset, a play by Babel, and almost for the first time in my life I found that Jewry, as an ethnic fact, was a phenomenon of positive, unproblematic importance and power... I should like you to read this remarkable play...\\"Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence, 1921-1960, translated by Nicholas Pasternak Slater. Hoover Press, 2011, page 107. According to Babel's common law wife Antonina Pirozhkova, filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein was also an admirer of Sunset and often compared it to the writings of √âmile Zola for, \\"illuminating capitalist relationships through the experience of a single family.\\" Eisenstein was also quite critical of the Moscow Art Theatre, \\"for its weak staging of the play, particularly for failing to convey to the audience every single word of its unusually terse text.\\"At His Side, page 83.

Piloting a MiG-17F while assigned to the 923rd Fighter Regiment, Bay claimed 7 aerial combat victories while engaged against aircraft of the USAF and USN: 2 F-8s, 1 F-4B, 1 A-4C and 1 F-105D. Of the 7 claimed kills, 5 are acknowledged by American records. Of 16 VPAF (North Vietnamese) aces during Vietnam War, only Bay, Luu Huy Chao, and Le Hai solely flew MiG-17s. Background Nguyen Van Bay was born in 1937 in a place nowadays Sa ƒê√©c City, ƒê·ªìng Th√°p Province. He was the seventh of 11 children.Ch√¢n dung anh h√πng th·ªùi ƒë·∫°i H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh ‚àí2002 ‚Äì Volume 1 ‚Äì Page 291 \\"Anh h√∫ng NGUY·ªÑN VƒÇN B·∫¢Y.

When the war ended in 1954, Vietnam was divided into two countries along the 17th Parallel; North Vietnam and South Vietnam. Bay chose to stay in the North, at which time he lost all contact with his family. In 1962, Bay volunteered for flight training and was among the first pilot trainees sent to train in the People's Republic of China. As he told it, he \\"went from the bicycle to the airplane with no stop in between.\\" He learned to drive a car only long after he began flight training. Nguyen Van Bay and the Aces from the North (June 30, 2008) Bay and the other trainees started with Yak-18s, then moved on to MiG-15s, finally graduating to the MiG-17s. Similar to U.S. pilots, the North Vietnamese usually flew 200 hours in training before going into combat. Bay's training took four years, successfully completing his training in January 1966. Vietnam People's Air force Bay was part of the 923rd Fighter Regiment during the Vietnam War. When the regiment was created on September 7, 1965, Bay was chosen as one of the students to fly the MiG-17. Soon after his training was completed in January 1966, he would have his first engagement with American aircraft. Note: The following aerial engagements do not match with the number of aircraft he shot down, according to the United States Air Force. The aircraft he shot down as claimed by the USAF are 2 F-8s, 1 F-4B, 1 A-4C and 1 F-105D. In addition, the following engagements suggest that he shot down 8 aircraft even though he is credited with 7. =October 6, 1965= Bay had his first engagement when he was attacked by an F-4 Phantom. The F-4 fired an AIM-7D missile that detonated off his left wing. His MiG-17 then pitched down and started vibrating. Bay managed to land safely at Noi Bai airfield, just north of Hanoi. He would later state, \\"I felt like a light boxer who confidently walked up to the ring and tried to knock out the super heavy boxers. It was not a single fight but dozens of dogfights. We were outnumbered four or five to one. Our thoughts were on survival, nothing more.\\"Nguyen Van Bay and the Aces from the North (July 2, 2008) =April 1966= In late April 1966, North Vietnamese radar indicated U.S. aircraft approaching Bac Son and Dinh Ca districts. An officer then scrambled four Mig-17s to intercept them, Bay was among the Mig-17s sent. Shortly after takeoff, Bay spotted eight F-4 Phantoms. As the formation of F-4s turned, one of them swung wide. Taking advantage of this, Bay cut the F-4 off, and closed in to gun range; when the Phantom was in his windscreen, he fired. The F-4 then went down. =June 21, 1966= Bay and three other MiG-17s were sent to engage an RF-8A (reconnaissance variant) and its escorting F-8s. Despite two Migs being destroyed by the F-8s, Bay managed to down one F-8 piloted by Cole Black. While Bay and the other MiG-17s were engaging the F-8s, the lead Mig-17, piloted by Phan Thanh Trung, shot down the RF-8A. =June 29, 1966= Bay and three other MiG-17s were sent to engage F-105 Thunderchiefs heading for the fuel depots in Hanoi. With the help of fellow pilot Phan Van Tuc, catching the lead F-105 by surprise, Bay shot it down. The downed F-105 pilot was a Korean War ace, James H. Kasler, although American sources claim that Kasler was shot down on August 8. =September 5, 1966= Le Thanh Chon, the senior control officer at Gia Lam airfield, vectored Bay and his wing-man Vo Van Man to an unknown target in the South. As they headed south, Bay observed a flight of A-4 Skyhawks flying away from a smoking bridge. To his front, he observed two F-8 Crusaders approaching the A-4s from the right of where he was heading. Bay and his wingman jettisoned their drop tanks in preparation for battle. The F-8s took position behind the A-4s to escort them from the bridge. Chon, watching the events on radar ordered Bay to fly forward, Bay was then given permission to engage, at which time he attacked the trailing F-8, adjusting his fire on the tracers. As his rounds struck near the canopy of the F-8, the plane began coming apart, Crusader pieces filled the air as Bay's MiG started to fly through them. Avoiding the danger, he pulled away, at the same time observing the pilot ejecting from his aircraft. The engagement lasted approximately 45 seconds, and when he landed, Plexiglas from the F-8 was found in his engine intake. The American F-8 pilot was captured shortly after ejecting, and turned out to be Wilfred K. Abbott, serving in the squadron VF-111, carrier . =September 16, 1966= In the early afternoon at Gia Lam airfield, Bay was flying in the number three position in a flight of four, when they were directed to engage US aircraft. Bay was the first to observe a flight of F-4s, and asked his flight leader, Ho Van Quy, for permission to attack, but Quy doubted they could catch up to the faster F-4s. Then Bay spotted an opportunity, the Phantoms began to make a climbing turn. Bay and his flight commenced to cut off the F-4s, he rolled in behind an F-4 piloted by Major John \\"Robbie\\" Robertson and his backseater Hubert Buchanan. As he closed the range he opened fire with his cannons. The F-4 pulled hard and then eased its turn. Bay adjusted and fired again, this time observing one of the F-4's wheels flying off of its wing. Buchanan ejected, while Robertson is believed to have died when their F-4 crashed. =September 21, 1966= On this date, Bay was flying the lead of a four-ship flight, when he was directed to a target 10 miles ahead by ground control. After a few minutes, Bay spotted two F-105s at around 10,000 to 13,000 feet. Bay than banked in pursuit, knowing that F-105s normally traveled in packs of four, he looked around for the other pair. Not able to locate the other F-105s, Bay gave his wing-man, Do Huy Hoang, permission to attack. Hoang flew wide to the left,Nguyen Van Bay and the Aces from the North (July 3, 2008) and lined up behind the second F-105. Hoang waited for the \\"Thuds\\" to turn, but instead they rolled into a shallow bank. Bay's flight had flown into an ambush. Flying low to avoid radar behind the first F-105s were First Lieutenant Karl Richter and Captain Ralph J. Beardsley. Richter jettisoned his rocket pods and lined up behind Hoang. Richter fired his M61 Gatling gun on Hoang. The airplane rolled on its own to wings level. Hoang lit the afterburner on his MiG and tried to regain control as his jet rolled to the right. Hoang's left wing was in tatters from Richter's Gatling Gun. Hoang checked his engine instruments and thought he was going to be fine, but then the plane began to come apart. Hoang had to eject. Bay, now alone, and with his fuel becoming low, found himself dodging multiple missiles from US aircraft;however, they began to depart North Vietnam's air space. At this time, Bay spotted Vo Van and followed him back to base. =April 24, 1967= Bay, assigned as flight leader, was scrambled from Kien An airfield. His flight was to intercept a United States Navy air raid at the Haiphong docks. Bay closed in on an unsuspecting F-8 Crusader piloted by Lt. Cdr. E.J. Tucker, and shot it down.

The F-4s fired several Sidewinders at Bay, but with his wing-man's warning, he was able to dodge them all. Bay was then able to maneuver himself into a good shooting position in which he then downed one of the attacking American aircraft. However, the crew of the F-4, Lt. Cdr. C.E. Southwick and Ens. J.W. Land believed that they had been shot down by AAA. =April 25, 1967= Bay and his flight were able to bring down two American A-4 Skyhawks. One A-4 was shot down by Bay himself while the other was shot down by his wing-man. Bay was awarded the Hero's Medal of the Vietnamese People's Army for his outstanding skill and bravery in combat, and for his superb leadership of his flight.\\"North Vietnamese Aces\\" (July 3, 2008) =Early 1972= In 1971 Bay and his fellow pilot Le Xuan Di were trained in anti-ship warfare by a Cuban advisor.

The genus name Apis is Latin for \\"bee\\", and mellifera is the Latin for \\"honey-bearing\\", referring to the species' production of honey. Like all honey bee species, the western honey bee is eusocial, creating colonies with a single fertile female (or \\"queen\\"), many normally non-reproductive females or \\"workers\\", and a small proportion of fertile males or \\"drones\\". Individual colonies can house tens of thousands of bees. Colony activities are organized by complex communication between individuals, through both pheromones and the dance language. The western honey bee was one of the first domesticated insects, and it is the primary species maintained by beekeepers to this day for both its honey production and pollination activities. With human assistance, the western honey bee now occupies every continent except Antarctica. Western honey bees are threatened by pests and diseases, especially the Varroa mite and colony collapse disorder. As of 2019, the western honey bee is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List, as numerous studies indicate that the species has undergone significant declines in Europe; however, it is not clear if they refer to population reduction of wild or managed colonies. Further research is required to enable differentiation between wild and non-wild colonies in order to determine the conservation status of the species in the wild. Western honey bees are an important model organism in scientific studies, particularly in the fields of social evolution, learning, and memory; they are also used in studies of pesticide toxicity, to assess non-target impacts of commercial pesticides. Distribution and habitat Global distribution The western honey bee can be found on every continent except Antarctica. The species is believed to have originated in Africa or Asia, and it spread naturally through Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Humans are responsible for its considerable additional range, introducing European subspecies into North America (early 1600s), South America, Australia, New Zealand, and eastern Asia. Western honey bees adapted to the local environments as they spread geographically. These adaptations include synchronizing colony cycles to the timing of local flower resources, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, and enhanced foraging behavior in desert areas. All together, these variations resulted in 31 recognized subspecies, all of which are cross- fertile. The subspecies are divided into four major branches, based on work by Ruttner and confirmed by mitochondrial DNA analysis. African subspecies belong to branch A, northwestern European subspecies branch M, southwestern European subspecies branch C and Middle-Eastern subspecies branch O. Life cycle =Colony life cycle= A bee swarm. Bees are non-aggressive in this state, since they have no hive to protect. Unlike most other bee species, western honey bees have perennial colonies which persist year after year. Because of this high degree of sociality and permanence, western honey bee colonies can be considered superorganisms. This means that reproduction of the colony, rather than individual bees, is the biologically significant unit. Western honey bee colonies reproduce through a process called \\"swarming\\". In most climates, western honey bees swarm in the spring and early summer, when there is an abundance of blooming flowers from which to collect nectar and pollen. In response to these favorable conditions, the hive creates one to two dozen new queens. Just as the pupal stages of these \\"daughter queens\\" are nearly complete, the old queen and approximately two-thirds of the adult workers leave the colony in a swarm, traveling some distance to find a new location suitable for building a hive (e.g., a hollow tree trunk). In the old colony, the daughter queens often start \\"piping\\", just prior to emerging as adults, and, when the daughter queens eventually emerge, they fight each other until only one remains; the survivor then becomes the new queen. If one of the sisters emerges before the others, she may kill her siblings while they are still pupae, before they have a chance to emerge as adults. Once she has dispatched all of her rivals, the new queen, the only fertile female, lays all the eggs for the old colony, which her mother has left. Virgin females are able to lay eggs, which develop into males (a trait shared with wasps, bees, and ants because of haplodiploidy). However, she requires a mate to produce female offspring, which comprise 90% or more of bees in the colony at any given time. Thus, the new queen goes on one or more nuptial flights, each time mating with 1‚Äì17 drones. Once she has finished mating, usually within two weeks of emerging, she remains in the hive, laying eggs. Throughout the rest of the growing season, the colony produces many workers, who gather pollen and nectar as cold-season food; the average population of a healthy hive in midsummer may be as high as 40,000 to 80,000 bees. Nectar from flowers is processed by worker bees, who evaporate it until the moisture content is low enough to discourage mold, transforming it into honey, which can then be capped over with wax and stored almost indefinitely. In the temperate climates to which western honey bees are adapted, the bees gather in their hive and wait out the cold season, during which the queen may stop laying. During this time, activity is slow, and the colony consumes its stores of honey used for metabolic heat production in the cold season. In mid- through late winter, the queen starts laying again. This is probably triggered by day length. Depending on the subspecies, new queens (and swarms) may be produced every year, or less frequently, depending on local environmental conditions. =Individual bee life cycle= Larvae (left) and eggs (right) Like other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, the western honey bee has four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. The complex social structure of western honey bee hives means that all of these life stages occur simultaneously throughout much of the year. The queen deposits a single egg into each cell of a honeycomb prepared by worker bees. The egg hatches into a legless, eyeless larva fed by \\"nurse\\" bees (worker bees who maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed in its cell by the nurse bees and begins its pupal stage. After another week, it emerges as an adult bee. It is common for defined regions of the comb to be filled with young bees (also called \\"brood\\"), while others are filled with pollen and honey stores. Worker bees secrete the wax used to build the hive, clean, maintain and guard it, raise the young and forage for nectar and pollen; the nature of the worker's role varies with age. For the first 10 days of their lives, worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, workers receive nectar and pollen from older workers and store it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. Although worker bees are usually infertile females, when some subspecies are stressed they may lay fertile eggs. Since workers are not fully sexually developed, they do not mate with drones and thus can only produce haploid (male) offspring. Queens and workers have a modified ovipositor called a stinger, with which they defend the hive. Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species, the stinger of worker western honey bees is barbed. Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception is based on the fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a human or other mammal. The stinger and its venom sac, with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering venom after they are detached, are designed to pull free of the body when they lodge. This apparatus (including barbs on the stinger) is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and the stinger apparatus does not detach) unless the stinger is embedded in elastic material. The barbs do not always \\"catch\\", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again). Although the average lifespan of a queen in most subspecies is three to five years, reports from the German honey bee subspecies (A. m. mellifera) previously used for beekeeping indicate that a queen can live up to eight years. Because a queen's store of sperm is depleted near the end of her life, she begins laying more unfertilized eggs; for this reason, beekeepers often replace queens every year or two. The lifespan of workers varies considerably over the year in regions with long winters. Workers born in spring and summer work hard, and live only a few weeks, but those born in autumn remain inside for several months as the colony clusters. On average during the year, about 1% of a colony's worker bees die naturally per day.Tautz, J. Phaenomen Honigbiene Springer 2003, 280 pages, pg 47 Except for the queen, all of a colony's workers are replaced about every four months. Social caste Western honey bee on a lavender blossom Behavioral and physiological differences between castes and subcastes arise from phenotypic plasticity, which relies on gene expression rather than heritable genotypic differences. =Queens= The queen bee is a fertile female, who, unlike workers (which are genetically also female), has a fully developed reproductive tract. She is larger than her workers, and has a characteristic rounder, longer abdomen. A female egg can become either a queen or a worker bee. Workers and queen larva are both fed royal jelly, which is high in protein and low in flavonoid, during the first three days. After that, workers are switched to a diet of mixed pollen and nectar (often called \\"bee bread\\"), while queens continue to receive royal jelly. In the absence of flavonoid and the presence of a high- protein diet, queen bees develop a healthy reproductive tract‚Äîa task necessary for maintaining a colony of tens of thousands of daughter-workers. Periodically, the colony determines that a new queen is needed. There are three general causes: # The hive is filled with honey, leaving little room for new eggs. This will trigger a swarm, where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony and leave the new queen with the other half of the workers to continue the old one. # The old queen begins to fail, which is thought to be demonstrated by a decrease in queen pheromones throughout the hive. This is known as supersedure, and at its end, the old queen is usually killed. # The old queen dies suddenly, a situation known as emergency supersedure. The worker bees find several eggs (or larvae) of the appropriate age range and try to develop them into queens. Emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because new queen cells are built out from comb cells, instead of hanging from the bottom of a frame. Regardless of the trigger, workers develop the larvae into queens by continuing to feed them royal jelly. Peanut-like queen brood cells extend outward from the brood comb Queens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb. A queen cell is larger and oriented vertically. If workers sense that an old queen is weakening, they produce emergency cells (known as supersedure cells) from cells with eggs or young larvae and which protrude from the comb. When the queen finishes her larval feeding and pupates, she moves into a head- downward position and later chews her way out of the cell. At pupation, workers cap (seal) the cell. The queen asserts control over the worker bees by releasing a complex suite of pheromones, known as queen scent. After several days of orientation in and around the hive, the young queen flies to a drone congregation point ‚Äì a site near a clearing and generally about above the ground ‚Äì where drones from different hives congregate. They detect the presence of a queen in their congregation area by her smell, find her by sight and mate with her in midair; drones can be induced to mate with \\"dummy\\" queens with the queen pheromone. A queen will mate multiple times, and may leave to mate several days in a row (weather permitting) until her spermatheca is full. The queen lays all the eggs in a healthy colony. The number and pace of egg- laying is controlled by weather, resource availability and specific racial characteristics. Queens generally begin to slow egg-laying in the early fall, and may stop during the winter. Egg-laying generally resumes in late winter when the days lengthen, peaking in the spring. At the height of the season, the queen may lay over 2,500 eggs per day (more than her body mass). She fertilizes each egg (with stored sperm from the spermatheca) as it is laid in a worker-sized cell. Eggs laid in drone-sized (larger) cells are left unfertilized; these unfertilized eggs, with half as many genes as queen or worker eggs, develop into drones. = Workers = Workers are females produced by the queen that develop from fertilized, diploid eggs. Workers are essential for social structure and proper colony functioning. They carry out the main tasks of the colony, because the queen is occupied with only reproducing. These females raise their sister workers and future queens that eventually leave the nest to start their own colony. They also forage and return to the nest with nectar and pollen to feed the young. =Drones= Development of a drone pupa Pupae of drones Drones are the colony's male bees. Since they do not have ovipositors, they do not have stingers. Drone honey bees do not forage for nectar or pollen. The primary purpose of a drone is to fertilize a new queen. Many drones mate with a given queen in flight; each dies immediately after mating, since the process of insemination requires a lethally convulsive effort. Drone honey bees are haploid (single, unpaired chromosomes) in their genetic structure, and are descended only from their mother (the queen). In temperate regions, drones are generally expelled from the hive before winter, dying of cold and starvation since they cannot forage, produce honey or care for themselves. Given their larger size (1.5 times that of worker bees), inside the hive it is believed that drones may play a significant role in thermoregulation. Drones are typically located near the center of hive clusters for unclear reasons. It is postulated that it is to maintain sperm viability, which may be compromised at cooler temperatures. Another possible explanation is that a more central location allows drones to contribute to warmth, since at temperatures below their ability to contribute declines. Queen-worker conflict When a fertile female worker produces drones, a conflict arises between her interests and those of the queen. The worker shares one-half of her genes with the drone and one-quarter with her brothers, favouring her offspring over those of the queen. The queen shares one-half of her genes with her sons and one-quarter with the sons of fertile female workers. This pits the worker against the queen and other workers, who try to maximize their reproductive fitness by rearing the offspring most related to them. This relationship leads to a phenomenon called \\"worker policing\\". In these rare situations, other worker bees in the hive, who are genetically more related to the queen's sons than those of the fertile workers, patrol the hive and remove worker-laid eggs. Another form of worker policing is aggression toward fertile females. Some studies suggest a queen pheromone which may help workers distinguish worker-laid and queen-laid eggs, but others indicate egg viability as the key factor in eliciting the behavior. Worker policing is an example of forced altruism, where the benefits of worker reproduction are minimized and that of rearing the queen's offspring maximized. In very rare instances, workers subvert the policing mechanisms of the hive, laying eggs faster than other workers remove them; this is known as anarchic syndrome. Anarchic workers can activate their ovaries at a higher rate and contribute a greater proportion of males to the hive. Although an increase in the number of drones decreases the overall productivity of the hive, it increases the reproductive fitness of the drones' mother. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at the individual and group levels for the stability of the hive. Under ordinary circumstances, if the queen dies or is removed, reproduction in workers increases because a significant proportion of workers then have activated ovaries. The workers produce a last batch of drones before the hive collapses. Although during this period worker policing is usually absent, in certain groups of bees it continues. According to the strategy of kin selection, worker policing is not favored if a queen mates just once. In that case, workers are related by three-quarters of their genes, and the sons of workers are related more than usual to sons of the queen. Then the benefit of policing is negated. Experiments confirming this hypothesis have shown a correlation between higher mating rates and increased rates of worker policing in many species of social hymenoptera.Davies, N.R., Krebs, J.R., and West, S.A. An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology. 4th ed. West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2012. Print. pp. 387‚Äì388 Behavior =Thermoregulation= Foraging honey bee The western honey bee needs an internal body temperature of to fly; this temperature is maintained in the nest to develop the brood, and is the optimal temperature for the creation of wax. The temperature on the periphery of the cluster varies with outside air temperature, and the winter cluster's internal temperature may be as low as . Western honey bees can forage over a 30 ¬∞C (54 ¬∞F) air-temperature range because of behavioral and physiological mechanisms for regulating the temperature of their flight muscles. From low to high air temperatures, the mechanisms are: shivering before flight and stopping flight for additional shivering, passive body-temperature regulation based on work, and evaporative cooling from regurgitated honey-sac contents. Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards. The optimal air temperature for foraging is . During flight, the bee's relatively large flight muscles create heat which must be dissipated. The honey bee uses evaporative cooling to release heat through its mouth. Under hot conditions, heat from the thorax is dissipated through the head; the bee regurgitates a droplet of warm internal fluid ‚Äî a \\"honeycrop droplet\\" ‚Äì which reduces the temperature of its head by . Below bees are immobile, and above their activity slows. Western honey bees can tolerate temperatures up to for short periods. =Communication= A large honey bee swarm on a fallen tree trunk Western honey bee behavior has been extensively studied. Karl von Frisch, who received the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his study of honey bee communication, noticed that bees communicate with dance. Through these dances, bees communicate information regarding the distance, the situation, and the direction of a food source by the dances of the returning (honey bee) worker bee on the vertical comb of the hive. Honey bees direct other bees to food sources with the round dance and the waggle dance. Although the round dance tells other foragers that food is within of the hive, it provides insufficient information about direction. The waggle dance, which may be vertical or horizontal, provides more detail about the distance and direction of a food source. Foragers are also thought to rely on their olfactory sense to help locate a food source after they are directed by the dances. Western honey bees also change the precision of the waggle dance to indicate the type of site that is set as a new goal. Their close relatives, dwarf honey bees, do not. Therefore, western honey bees seem to have evolved a better means of conveying information than their common ancestors with the dwarf honey bee. Another means of communication is the shaking signal, also known as the jerking dance, vibration dance or vibration signal. Although the shaking signal is most common in worker communication, it also appears in reproductive swarming. A worker bee vibrates its body dorsoventrally while holding another bee with its front legs. Jacobus Biesmeijer, who examined shaking signals in a forager's life and the conditions leading to its performance, found that experienced foragers executed 92% of observed shaking signals and 64% of these signals were made after the discovery of a food source. About 71% of shaking signals occurred before the first five successful foraging flights of the day; other communication signals, such as the waggle dance, were performed more often after the first five successes. Biesmeijer demonstrated that most shakers are foragers and the shaking signal is most often executed by foraging bees on pre-foraging bees, concluding that it is a transfer message for several activities (or activity levels). Sometimes the signal increases activity, as when active bees shake inactive ones. At other times, such as the end of the day, the signal is an inhibitory mechanism. However, the shaking signal is preferentially directed towards inactive bees. All three forms of communication among honey bees are effective in foraging and task management. Pheromones Pheromones (substances involved in chemical communication) are essential to honey bee survival. Western honey bees rely on pheromones for nearly all behaviors, including mating, alarm, defense, orientation, kin and colony recognition, food production and integrating colony activities.Free, John B., Pheromones of social bees. Ithaca, N.Y.: Comstock, 1987.Blum, M.S. 1992. Honey bee pheromones in The Hive and the Honey Bee, revised edition (Dadant and Sons: Hamilton, Illinois), pages 385‚Äì389. Domestication honey hunter in a cave painting at Cuevas de la Ara√±a, Spain, c. 8,000‚Äì6,000 BC Bee hieroglyph from the tomb complex of Senusret I (d. 1,926 BC) Humans have been collecting honey from western honey bees for thousands of years, with evidence in the form of rock art found in France and Spain, dating to around 7,000 BCE. The western honey bee is one of the few invertebrate animals to have been domesticated. Bees were likely first domesticated in ancient Egypt, where tomb paintings depict beekeeping. Europeans brought bees to North America in 1622. Beekeepers have selected western honey bees for several desirable features: * the ability of a colony to survive periods with little food * the ability of a colony to survive cold weather * resistance to disease * increased honey production * reduced aggressiveness * reduced tendency to swarm * reduced nest building * easy pacification with smoke These modifications, along with artificial change of location, have improved western honey bees from the point of view of the beekeeper, and simultaneously made them more dependent on beekeepers for their survival. In Europe, cold weather survival was likely selected for, consciously or not, while in Africa, selection probably favoured the ability to survive heat, drought, and heavy rain. Authors do not agree on whether this degree of artificial selection constitutes genuine domestication. In 1603, John Guillim wrote \\"The Bee I may well reckon a domestic insect, being so pliable to the benefit of the keeper.\\" More recently, many biologists working on pollination take the domesticated status of western honey bees for granted. For example, Rachael Winfree and colleagues write \\"We used crop pollination as a model system, and investigated whether the loss of a domesticated pollinator (the honey bee) could be compensated for by native, wild bee species.\\" Similarly, Brian Dennis and William Kemp write: \\"Although the domestication of the honey bee is closely connected to the evolution of food-based socio-economic systems in many cultures throughout the world, in current economic terms, and in the U.S. alone, the estimated wholesale value of honey, more than $317 million dollars in 2013, pales in comparison to aggregate estimated annual value of pollination services, variously valued at $11‚Äì15 billion.\\" On the other hand, P. R. Oxley and B. P. Oldroyd (2010) consider the domestication of western honey bees, at best, partial. Oldroyd observes that the lack of full domestication is somewhat surprising, given that people have kept bees for at least 7,000 years. Instead, beekeepers have found ways to manage bees using hives, while the bees remain \\"largely unchanged from their wild cousins\\". Leslie Bailey and B. V. Ball, in their book Honey Bee Pathology, call western honey bees \\"feral insects\\", in contrast to the domestic silkmoth (Bombyx mori) which they call \\"the only insect that has been domesticated\\", and refer to the \\"popular belief among many biologists as well as beekeepers that bees are domesticated\\". They argue that western honey bees are able to survive without human help, and in fact require to \\"be left at liberty\\" to survive. Further, they argue that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants. Therefore, they argue, beekeeping is \\"the exploitation of colonies of a wild insect\\", with little more than the provision of a weatherproof cavity for them to nest in. Likewise, Pilar de la Rua and colleagues argue that western honey bees are not fully domesticated, because \\"endemic subspecies-specific genetic footprints can still be identified in Europe and Africa\\", making conservation of wild bee diversity important. Further, they argue that the difficulty of controlling drones for mating is a serious handicap and a sign that domestication is not complete, in particular as \\"extensive gene flow usually occurs between wild/feral and managed honeybee populations\\". Beekeeping Queen bee with workers The western honey bee is a colonial insect which is housed, transported by and sometimes fed by beekeepers. Honey bees do not survive and reproduce individually, but as part of the colony (a superorganism). Western honey bees collect flower nectar and convert it to honey, which is stored in the hive. The nectar, transported in the bees' stomachs, is converted with the addition of digestive enzymes and storage in a honey cell for partial dehydration. Nectar and honey provide the energy for the bees' flight muscles and for heating the hive during the winter. Western honey bees also collect pollen which, after being processed to bee bread, supplies protein and fat for the bee brood to grow. Centuries of selective breeding by humans have created western honey bees which produce far more honey than the colony needs, and beekeepers (also known as apiarists) harvest the surplus honey. Honey bees removed from the hive for inspection by a beekeeper Beekeepers provide a place for the colony to live and store honey. There are seven basic types of beehive: skeps, Langstroth hives, top-bar hives, box hives, log gums, D. E. hives, and miller hives. All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee inspectors to check the brood for disease. This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers). In cold climates, some beekeepers have kept colonies alive (with varying degrees of success) by moving them indoors for winter. While this can protect the colonies from extremes of temperature and make winter care and feeding more convenient for the beekeeper, it increases the risk of dysentery and causes an excessive buildup of carbon dioxide from the bees' respiration. Inside wintering has been refined by Canadian beekeepers, who use large barns solely for the wintering of bees; automated ventilation systems assist in carbon dioxide dispersal. = Products = Western honey bee in a park in Tokyo Beehives set up for pollination Video of western honey bee collecting pollen from blue crocuses basket back to the hive = Honey bees = Honey bees are one of the products of a beehive. They can be purchased as mated queens, in spring packages of a queen along with two to five pounds (0.91 to 2.27 kg) of honey bees, as nucleus colonies (which include frames of brood), or as full colonies. Commerce of western honey bees dates back to as early as 1622, when the first colonies of bees were shipped from England to Virginia. Modern methods of producing queens and dividing colonies for increase date back to the late 1800s. Honey was extracted by killing off the hive, and bees and bee products were mainly an object of local trade. The first commercial beekeeper in the United States is considered Moses Quinby of New York, who experimented with movable box hives, which allow extraction without killing the hive. The improvements in roads and motor vehicles after World War I allowed commercial beekeepers to expand the size of their businesses. = Pollination = Western honey bee pollinating a flower The western honey bee is an important pollinator of crops; this service accounts for much of the species' commercial value. In 2005, the estimated commercial value of western honey bees was just under $200 billion worldwide. A large number of the crop species farmed worldwide depend on it. Although orchards and fields have increased in size, wild pollinators have dwindled. In a number of regions the pollination shortage is addressed by migratory beekeepers, who supply hives during a crop bloom and move them after the blooming period. Commercial beekeepers plan their movements and wintering locations according to anticipated pollination services. At higher latitudes it is difficult (or impossible) to overwinter sufficient bees, or to have them ready for early blooming plants. Much migration is seasonal, with hives wintering in warmer climates and moving to follow the bloom at higher latitudes. In California, almond pollination occurs in February, early in the growing season before local hives have built up their populations. Almond orchards require two hives per acre, or per hive, for maximum yield, and pollination is dependent on the importation of hives from warmer climates. Almond pollination (in February and March in the U.S.) is the largest managed pollination event in the world, requiring more than one-third of all managed honey bees in the country. Bees are also moved en masse for pollination of apples in New York, Michigan, and Washington. Despite honey bees' inefficiency as blueberry pollinators, large numbers are moved to Maine because they are the only pollinators who can be easily moved and concentrated for this and other monoculture crops. Bees and other insects maintain flower constancy by transferring pollen to other biologically specific plants; this prevents flower stigmas from being clogged with pollen from other species. In 2000, Drs. Roger Morse and Nicholas Calderone of Cornell University attempted to quantify the effects of the western honey bee on only US food crops. Their calculations came up with a figure of US$14.6 billion in food crop value. = Honey = Honey is the complex substance made from nectar and sweet deposits from plants and trees, which are gathered, modified and stored in the comb by honey bees. Honey is a biological mixture of inverted sugars, primarily glucose and fructose. It has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties. Honey from the western honey bee, along with the bee Tetragonisca angustula, has specific antibacterial activity towards an infection-causing bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus. Honey will not rot or ferment when stored under normal conditions, but it will crystallize over time. Although crystallized honey is acceptable for human use, bees can only use liquid honey and will remove and discard any crystallized honey from the hive. Western honey bee with \\"tongue\\" partially extended Bees produce honey by collecting nectar, a clear liquid consisting of nearly 80 percent water and complex sugars. The collecting bees store the nectar in a second stomach and return to the hive, where worker bees remove the nectar. The worker bees digest the raw nectar for about 30 minutes, using digestive enzymes to break down the complex sugars into simpler ones. Raw honey is then spread in empty honeycomb cells to dry, reducing its water content to less than 20 percent. When nectar is being processed, honey bees create a draft through the hive by fanning with their wings. When the honey has dried, the honeycomb cells are sealed (capped) with wax to preserve it. = Beeswax = Mature worker bees secrete beeswax from glands on their abdomen, using it to form the walls and caps of the comb. When honey is harvested, the wax can be collected for use in products like candles and seals. = Bee bread = Bees collect pollen in a pollen basket and carry it back to the hive where, after undergoing fermentation and turning into bee bread, it becomes a protein source for brood-rearing. Excess pollen can be collected from the hive; although it is sometimes consumed as a dietary supplement by humans, bee pollen may cause an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals. = Bee brood = Bee brood, the eggs, larvae, or pupae of honey bees, is edible and highly nutritious. Bee brood contains the same amount of protein that beef or poultry does. Bee brood is often harvested as a byproduct when the beekeeper has excess bees and does not wish to have any more. = Propolis = Propolis is a resinous mixture collected by honey bees from tree buds, sap flows or other botanical sources, which is used as a sealant for unwanted open spaces in the hive. Although propolis is alleged to have health benefits (tincture of propolis is marketed as a cold and flu remedy), it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals. Propolis is also used in wood finishes, and gives a Stradivarius violin its unique red color. = Royal jelly = Royal jelly is a honey bee secretion used to nourish the larvae and queen. It is marketed for its alleged but unsupported claims of health benefits. On the other hand, it may cause severe allergic reactions in some individuals. Genome Female bees are diploid and have 32 chromosomes, whereas males are haploid and have only 16. As of October 28, 2006, the Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium fully sequenced and analyzed the genome of Apis mellifera, the western honey bee. Since 2007, attention has been devoted to colony collapse disorder, a decline in western honey bee colonies in a number of regions. The western honey bee is the third insect, after the fruit fly and the mosquito, whose genome has been mapped. According to scientists who analyzed its genetic code, the honey bee originated in Africa and spread to Europe in two ancient migrations. Scientists have found that genes related to smell outnumber those for taste, and the European honey bee has fewer genes regulating immunity than the fruit fly and the mosquito. The genome sequence also revealed that several groups of genes, particularly those related to circadian rhythm, resembled those of vertebrates more than other insects. Another significant finding from the honey bee genome study was that the western honey bee was the first insect to be discovered with a functional DNA methylation system since functional key enzymes (DNA methyltransferase-1 and -3) were identified in the genome. DNA methylation is one of the important mechanisms in epigenetics to study gene expression and regulation without changing the DNA sequence, but modifications on DNA activity. DNA methylation later was identified to play an important role in gene regulation and gene splicing. The genome is unusual in having few transposable elements, although they were present in the evolutionary past (remains and fossils have been found) and evolved more slowly than those in fly species. Hazards and survival =Parasites, diseases and pesticides= Western honey bee populations face threats to their survival increasing interests into other pollinator species, like the common eastern bumblebee. North American and European populations were severely depleted by Varroa mite infestations during the early 1990s, and U.S. beekeepers were further affected by colony collapse disorder in 2006 and 2007. Improved cultural practices and chemical treatments against Varroa mites saved most commercial operations; new bee breeds are beginning to reduce beekeeper dependence on acaricides. Feral bee populations were greatly reduced during this period; they are slowly recovering, primarily in mild climates, due to natural selection for Varroa resistance and repopulation by resistant breeds. Although it is generally believed that insecticides have also depleted bee populations, particularly when used in excess of label directions, as bee pests and diseases (including American foulbrood and tracheal mites) are becoming resistant to medications, research in this regard has not been conclusive. A 2012 study of the effect of neonicotinoid-based insecticides showed \\"no effects observed in field studies at field-realistic dosages.\\" A new study in 2020 found that neonicotinoid insecticides affected the developmental stability of honey bees, particularly haploid males were more susceptible to neonicotinoids than diploid females. The 2020 study also found that heterozygosity may play a key role in buffering insecticide exposure. East African lowland honey bee (Apis mellifera scutellata) in Tanzania extracts nectar from a flower, as pollen grains stick to its body =Predators= Insect predators of western honey bees include the Asian giant hornet and other wasps, robber flies, dragonflies such as the green darner, some praying mantises, water striders and the European beewolf. Arachnid predators of western honey bees include fishing spiders, lynx spiders, goldenrod spiders and St. Andrew's cross spiders. Reptile and amphibian predators of western honey bees include the black girdled lizard, anoles, and other lizards, and various anuran amphibians including the American toad, the American bullfrog and the wood frog. Specialist bird predators of western honey bees include the bee-eaters; other birds that may take western honey bees include grackles, hummingbirds, tyrant flycatchers and the summer tanager. Most birds that eat bees do so opportunistically; however, summer tanagers will sit on a limb and catch dozens of bees from the hive entrance as they emerge. Mammals that sometimes take western honey bees include bears, opossums, raccoons, skunks, the North American least shrew and the honey badger. As an environmental threat As an invasive species, feral western honey bees are a significant environmental problem in non-native areas. Imported bees may displace native bees and birds, and may also promote reproduction of invasive plants ignored by native pollinators. Honey bees are not native to the Americas, arriving with colonists in North America in the 18th century. Thomas Jefferson mentioned this in his Notes on the State of Virginia: Honey bees have become an invasive species in the US, outcompeting native pollinators when resources are tight. With an increased number of honey bees in a specific area due to beekeeping, domesticated bees and native wild bees often have to compete for the limited habitat and food sources available. Western honey bees may become defensive in response to the seasonal arrival of competition from other colonies, particularly Africanized bees which may be on the offence and defence year round due to their tropical origin. In the United Kingdom, honey bees are known to compete with native bumblebees such as Bombus hortorum, because they forage at the same sites. To resolve the issue and maximize both their total consumption during foraging, bumblebees forage early in the morning, while honey bees forage during the afternoon. Most flowering plants depend on specialized pollinators to efficiently fertilize them. Cucurbits, for example, are pollinated by squash bees that specifically visit the early-blooming male flowers before sunrise, when honey bees are inactive, and then return to pollinate the female flowers later in the day. Such symbiotic relationships also mean that the specialized pollinator will be covered mainly in its host's specific pollen. The very generalized nature of the honey bee's nectar-gathering activities, potentially visiting dozens of different species in a single day, means that a flower visited by a honey bee will often get very little pollen from its own species. This diminished pollination can reduce the plant's ability to produce seeds, especially when the honey bees are squeezing out the native pollinators for a species, a problem occurring all over the United States because of honey bees and other invasive species.Do managed bees have negative effects on wild bees?: A systematic review of the literature Our review found that the majority of studies reach the conclusion that managed bees negatively affect, or have the potential to negatively affect, wild bees through competition, changes in plant communities, or transmission of pathogens. Unlike native bees, they do not properly extract or transfer pollen from plants with pore anthers (anthers which only release pollen through tiny apical pores); this requires buzz pollination, a behavior rarely exhibited by honey bees. Honey bees reduce fruiting in Melastoma affine, a plant with pore anthers, by robbing its stigmas of previously deposited pollen.  Close relatives  Apart from Apis mellifera, there are six other species in the genus Apis. These are Apis andreniformis, Apis cerana, Apis dorsata, Apis florea, Apis koschevnikovi, and Apis nigrocincta.Winston, Mark L. The biology of the honey bee. Harvard University Press, 1991. These species all originated in southern and southeastern Asia. Only Apis mellifera is thought to have originated in Europe, Asia, and Africa.

The museum is dedicated to black visual arts heritage worldwide, and presents historical and contemporary exhibitions in many media, including painting, sculpture, graphics, photography and decorative arts. The museum is operated by the National Center of Afro-American Artists. House history The pointed arches on Abbotsford's windows and main entrance are characteristics of the High Victorian Gothic style, inspired by the architecture of the Middle Ages. Designed by Boston architect Alden Frink for the prominent industrialist Aaron Davis Williams, Abbotsford was built in 1872 in the High Victorian Gothic style. Just as the American economy was becoming industrialized, many people looked with nostalgia to times before machines and factories. Ironically, Aaron Davis Williams, Jr., used his profits from industry to build a house that could remind him of a medieval castle. Following setbacks in his business, Williams was forced to sell Abbotsford to James M. Smith, who was born in Scotland in 1811, came to Boston in 1854, and was treasurer of the Suffolk Brewery in South Boston. Smith died at his home in Roxbury February 8, 1894. By 1923, the mansion was too large for private use, and the City of Boston purchased it as a disciplinary school for boys. In 1976, the National Center for Afro-American Artists bought the property and turned it into a museum. This new use has made it possible for community residents to enjoy Abbotsford today. This building is significant to Roxbury for several reasons. The most obvious is its beauty. It is a stately mansion that commands its site, and continues to be important to the community as the setting for the museum. In addition, it is built entirely of Roxbury puddingstone, a local building material. Finally, this building tells much about how people thought about their houses and their lives. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

The by-election was held on the same day as the Lyne by- election, and the Western Australian state election. The writ for the by- election was issued 4 August, with the rolls closing on 8 August. Candidate nominations closed on 14 August. The by-election was contested on the same boundaries drawn for Mayo at the 2007 federal election. The seat was won by Jamie Briggs of the Liberal Party on a two-candidate preferred vote of 53 per cent against the Greens. Background Downer first won the seat of Mayo at its creation at the 1984 federal election. He retained the seat at each subsequent election. The 2007 Liberal two-party-preferred vote of 57.1 percent was at the time the narrowest in the seat's history. Except for 1998, the seat was won at each election by the Liberals on primary votes alone. Despite this, the Australian Democrats and independents have traditionally polled well, including two elections where the Democrats and independent Brian Deegan came second. At the 1998 election the Democrats reduced the Mayo Liberal margin to just 1.7 percent. At the 2007 federal election, Downer retained his seat against his main Labor Party competitor by a two-party preferred vote of 57.06 percent to 42.94 percent. However, the opposition Labor Party defeated the incumbent Liberal-National coalition government, the first change of government in over 11 years. Downer had served as Foreign Minister throughout the duration of the previous government. He was also Liberal leader and leader of the opposition for several months in 1994. On 3 July 2008, Downer announced his intention to resign his seat. He officially resigned from parliament on 14 July. He, with Mark Vaile in Lyne, became the next former Howard government ministers returned at the 2007 election to resign their seats. Peter McGauran had done likewise earlier in 2008. Candidates Eleven candidates contested the by-election. They are listed below in ballot order. *Australian Greens ‚Äì Lynton Vonow, Adelaide Hills resident, school services officer.Lynton Vonow ‚Äì Candidate for Mayo: Greens.org.au *Conservatives for Climate and Environment ‚Äì Rachael Barons. *Independent ‚Äì Bill Spragg, Adelaide Hills councillor and lecturer in information technology at TAFE SA, who had also contested Mayo in 2001. *One Nation ‚Äì Mathew Keizer, Adelaide Hills resident and domestic community support worker. *Independent ‚Äì Mary Brewerton, retired nurse, contested Mayo for Labor in 2007. *Australian Democrats ‚Äì Andrew Castrique, Adelaide Hills resident, school laboratory technician. *Liberal Party of Australia ‚Äì Jamie Briggs, former Howard government advisor *Independent ‚Äì Malcolm Ronald King, retired. *Family First Party ‚Äì Bob Day, businessman and former Liberal Party member. *Democratic Labor Party ‚Äì David McCabe, clerk. *Independent ‚Äì Di Bell, anthropologist and author. South Australian independent Senator Nick Xenophon gave support to Bell's campaign. Labor opted not to stand a candidate. Liberal preselection The candidature of Liberal Jamie Briggs was criticised because of his role in controversial industrial- relations policies and reports that some Liberal Party colleagues were unhappy with his preselection. Bob Day, who had held membership of the Liberal Party for 20 years and was the endorsed Liberal candidate for Makin in 2007, quit the party after failing to win Mayo preselection with 10 out of 271 votes, claiming a \\"manipulated\\" preselection process. Iain Evans, who came second to Briggs, agreed to some extent. Results The Liberals retained the seat despite a reduced 41.3 percent primary vote after suffering a 9.8 percent primary swing. Some commentators drew comparisons between this and the 2002 Cunningham by-election. The Liberal two-candidate vote of 53 percent against Greens candidate Lynton Vonow compared to the previous election vote of 57.1 percent against Labor, which turned Mayo from a fairly safe seat in to a marginal two-candidate seat. The reduction of 4 percent cannot be considered a \\"two-party/candidate preferred swing\\" ‚àí when a major party is absent, preference flows to both major parties does not take place, resulting in asymmetric preference flows.An Example of Non-Monotonicity and Opportunities for Tactical Voting at an Australian Election: Antony Green ABC 4 May 2011 2016 outcome Eight years later, Rebekha Sharkie of the Nick Xenophon Team was successful in defeating Liberal incumbent Jamie Briggs in Mayo at the 2016 federal election with a 55 percent two-candidate vote to the Liberals' 45 percent two-candidate vote, a reduction of 17.2 percent. Additionally, Mayo became a marginal two-party seat for the first time with the Liberal two-party vote reduced to 55.4 percent, a two-party swing of 7.2 percent.

McInerney made his first appearance for the team during the 1918 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his emigration after the 1925 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals, three Munster medals and one Thomond Feis medal. Paddy McInerney was a contemporary of Pa \\"Fowler\\" McInerney, also of O'Callihan's Mills, who won Senior County All- Ireland Hurling Championships with Clare in 1916 and Dublin in 1932. At club level McInerney was a double county championship medalist with Young Irelands. Playing career =Club= McInerney played his club hurling with his local Young Irelands club and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title in 1920. The championship was suspended in 1921, however, McInerney added a second county medal to his collection in 1922. =Inter-county= McInerney first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Limerick in the late 1910s. In 1918 he first tasted success as, for the second year in-a- row, Limerick reached the Munster final. Clare provided the opposition on that occasion, however, McInerney‚Äôs side were the better team on the day. The final score of 11-3 to 1-2 tells its own story as McInerney collected his first Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Limerick take on Wexford. The first-half saw Limerick go on a goal-scoring spree as they took a half- time lead of 5-4 to 0-2. The goals continued in the second half as Limerick won the game by 9-5 to 1-3, giving McInerney his first All-Ireland medal. In 1919 Limerick reached their third consecutive Munster final. Cork were the opponents on that occasion, however, the All-Ireland champions were humbled with a 3-5 to 1-6 defeat. McInerney‚Äôs side were heavily beaten by Cork again in the 1920 provincial decider. In 1921 the Munster championship was affected by political strife. Because of this only Cork and Limerick participated with both sides contesting the provincial final for the third consecutive year. McInerney‚Äôs side avenged the defeats of the previous two years by beating Cork by 5-2 to 1-2. It was his second Munster title. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Limerick against Dublin. Once again, Limerick went on a goal- scoring rampage with captain Bob McConkey capturing four goals in all. Limerick went on to win the game by 8-5 to 3-2, giving McInerney a second All- Ireland medal. Limerick surrendered their Munster crown to Tipperary after a replay in 1922, however, they reversed that defeat in 1923 with McInerney, who wa snow captain of the team, adding a third Munster medal to his collection. He later lined out in his third All-Ireland final as Galway provided the opposition. In spite of Galway playing in their very first All-Ireland final they had yet to win a title. Limerick looked likely to capture a third All- Ireland title in six years, however, for the very first time the All-Ireland title went to a team from Connacht. The next few years saw Limerick go into decline in Munster and McInerney retired from inter-county hurling. Post- playing career McInerney, like many of his contemporaries was forced to give up the game of hurling in an effort to find work. He emigrated to the United States in the 1920s and remained there for the rest of his life. Paddy McInerney died in New Mexico in 1983.

History The school was founded in 1964 under the authority of Staffordshire County Council. Originally it was known as Tettenhall Number 2 with the number 1 school becoming Regis (now The Kings School). It is named after the River Smestow, to which it is very close, although the school grounds are actually bordered by the Finchfield Brook and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal. It was incorporated within Wolverhampton by the boundary changes accompanying local government reform in 1974, which brought Tettenhall as a whole into Wolverhampton. School Badge The school badge has its origins in the Tettenhall coat of arms.Reproduced at the Civic Heraldry of England website. The three roundels in the arms are of a special type, with a distinctive wavy pattern, known in Heraldry as fountains. They were considered to represent the Severn/Trent watershed and the tributary rivers which originate in the area, which include the River Smestow. The original Tettenhall arms had three trees, representing the three great forests of southern Staffordshire which met at Tettenhall: the forests of Kinver, Brewood and Cannock. The school badge adapted this into a tree composed of four circles, representing the four houses of the school, which were named after the new Universities of Lancaster, Sussex, Warwick and York, founded around the same time as the school. The badge also contains allusions to other features of the Tettenhall arms: the Windmill and the Battleaxes, reminders of the Battle of Tettenhall which took place on 5 August 910. Specialist school and academy status The school is a specialist sports college, and was presented with ARTSMARK (alongside the previously awarded SPORTSMARK) in 2004 for outstanding success in Drama & the Arts. Smestow has a wide variety of sporting facilities including a gymnasium, swimming pool, PE hall, four separate changing rooms, a fitness suite/gym, a small dance/aerobics area (also used for drama room) a set of tennis courts and two large playing fields as well as the new sports hall. On 1 February 2014 the school converted to academy status. Future plans In January 2015 a new Sixth Form Study Centre and library opened to promote and support students studying at Smestow. The school is benefiting from Building Schools for the Future funding and plan to build a sports hall within the next 3‚Äì4 years.

Glamp (May 13, 1921 - January 13, 1989) was a professional American football halfback and place kicker in the National Football League. He played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1947 thru 1949. Glamp attended and played football at Hurst High School, located in Norvelt, Pennsylvania. Many sources mistakenly state that Glamp attended Mount Pleasant Area High School, located in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania. However that school was not open until 1960 well after Glamp's high school time. That puts him at Hurst High School which merged with Ramsey High School in 1960 to form Mount Pleasant Area High School. He then attended and played at Louisiana State University. NFL career According to former Pittsburgh coach, Jock Sutherland, Glamp was the only Steeler in 1947 that could outrun guard, John Mastrangelo. On October 5, 1947, Glamp score six points (1 field goal and 3 extra points), however a field goal attempt with 25 seconds to play bounced off the left upright and resulted in a 27-26 Steelers loss to the Washington Redskins. In a 1948 rematch Pittsburgh took possession on downs at the Washington 41 with about a minute and a half to go. It appeared that Bob Nussbaumer had sealed the game when he intercepted Johnny Clement's pass, however a penalty against the Redskins nullified the turnover. Glamp then missed a 21-yard field goal, but the Redskins were offsides. Another offside pushed the line of scrimmage down to the 3 yard line. Glamp' game-winner came on the next play. For the 1948 season, Glamp set a Steelers scoring record, by posting 54 points that season. His record would stand until the 1950 season, when it was broken by Joe Geri. On October 23, 1949, Glamp recorded another 6 point game (1 field goal, 3 extra points) as the Steelers defeated the New York Bulldogs 24-13.

It was originally conceived by White as a single but then featured on the album of the same name (released in 1973), that peaked at number one on the Hot R&B; Albums Chart. The song peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and charted for 11 weeks. It also reached number five on the US Billboard R&B; chart and #46 Adult Contemporary. White composed and arranged both the instrumentals and vocals. Song information The song begins with a brief instrumental solo performed by The Love Unlimited Orchestra, the instrumentals are repeated while White speaks romantic words to his apparent love interest, this style is also used in his version of \\"Just the Way You Are\\" and Barry's other contemporary ballads. White then begins the song's first verse, after completing his vocals he repeats the title as a chorus. The song then ends with an extended instrumental set consisting of a flute, drums, violin, a bass guitar, and White's own piano playing as White continues to speak romantic words and later improvising vocals towards the end of the song. The song ends with a fade similar to traditional ballads of the same type. Influence and reception The romantic lyrics used in the song helped craft White's sexual persona, and the unusual orchestral combination of instruments in an R&B; song influenced the disco sound along with White's other mainly instrumental songs. I've Got So Much To Give was heavily acclaimed by Allmusic who felt it was obvious why the album reached the top of the R&B; charts, despite the fact I've Got So Much To Give followed a formula similar to White's past songs they stated \\"the novelty of White's approach, coupled with the universality of his subject matter, ensured that there was no sense of having heard it all before.\\" In a play written by Mark Frank (included in the book A Collection of Plays Written by Mark Frank), one of the main protagonist transforms himself into Barry White and performs the song.

High school Jasper was ranked in the top 40 in many national rankings, Japser was a consensus 4 star prospect. He was also the 5th ranked point guard in the class of 2006 by Rivals.com. He attended Paso Robles High School. After getting offers from schools such as Memphis, Washington, and Illinois, he decided to play at the University of Kentucky. He joined Jodie Meeks, Perry Stevenson, and Michael Porter as Kentucky's 2006 recruiting class. Kentucky As a freshman, he was chosen to start as Tubby Smith's point guard over junior Ramel Bradley. He ended up starting the final 27 games of the 2006‚Äì2007 season. After the 2006‚Äì07 season, Jasper thought about transferring but new coach Billy Gillispie convinced him to stay. Over the summer he had microfracture surgery performed on his left knee and ended up missing the first 10 games of the 2007‚Äì2008 season. When he returned to action, he was the Wildcats' sixth man until freshman star Patrick Patterson would go out for the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his ankle. After Patterson's injury, Jasper would take his place in the lineup. His final game with the Kentucky would be played in the first round of the 2008 NCAA Tournament vs. the Marquette Golden Eagles. UNLV In May 2008, rumors circulated that Jasper was transferring from Kentucky to a school closer to his Paso Robles, California home. The schools that were named as his possible destinations were UNLV, California, and UCLA. This proved to be true when he asked for his release from the team in June. Jasper said \\"My transfer is no indication of my experience here, I like the direction they're headed in, it's just that I would like to attend a place closer to my home.\\" Jasper ended up transferring to UNLV to play for head coach Lon Kruger. He said he liked how he fit in with the team and how Kruger motivated his players. He sat out the 2008‚Äì2009 season because of NCAA transfer rules. He is currently starting at guard for the Runnin' Rebels and has led the team to wins against #16 Louisville and #15 New Mexico. Texas Tech Jasper was hired by Texas Tech as a graduate assistant in 2011 before taking on his current role as assistant video coordinator. Paso Robles High School Now Jasper coaches at Paso Robles High School where he is now in his second year of coaching. Coming into his third year, the team had a disappointing 7-14 season, but Jasper is excited to teach and make other athletes better. He is confident in winning league in the following years, and maybe even a state championship later on. His enthusiasm toward the game makes everybody around him better.

Weimar Germany After serving in the army during the World War I, Pflugk- Harttung had become a member of the Freikorps, the paramilitary organizations that sprung up around Germany as soldiers returned in defeat from the war. The Freikorps were the key paramilitary groups active during the Weimar Republic. Many German veterans felt disconnected from civilian life and joined a Freikorps in search of stability within a military structure. Kapit√§nleutnant Horst von Pflugk-Harttung, along with his brother Heinz, were two such volunteers. The German volunteer movement was opposed to the communist Spartacists movement. During this period Pflugk-Harttung became friends with the future head of the Abwehr, Wilhelm Canaris. In 1919, Pflugk-Harttung along with his brother was accused of being directly involved in the murders of Spartacists Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.Armies of Spies, Author: Joseph Collomb, Published in 1939 by Macmillan, New York. Chapter 5, Franco's Fifth Column, page 88 Both men were acquitted, but many evidently thought them guilty, and his brother was assassinated sometime later.{1920} Sweden In 1931, Pflugk-Harttung was recorded as helping to coordinate fascist groups and organisation in Sweden. The Swedish authorities had Pflugk-Harttung expelled after they discovered that he had been importing armaments illegally into Sweden for Munckska k√•ren. Pflugk-Harttung then went to Norway on a similar mission, but again, he was soon asked to leave. Denmark By 1933 Pflugk- Harttung was working for German Intelligence in Denmark. As a cover, he worked as correspondent for Berliner Boersen Zeitung, which was a newspaper of the Reich War Ministry. His duties included many covert tasks, one being keeping a close eye on the German exiles in Denmark, with the Danish police co-operating with him by using go-betweens. Along with other postgraduates of Gestapo spy schools, Pflugk-Harttung set up a spy ring that operated secret broadcasting stations and had engaged in nautical and hydrographical research. It had drawn up maps and charts, graphs and complicated mathematical tables of data, which required the best technicians even to understand. They communicated by complex code systems, which changed frequently. The outlay for such an extensive apparatus could be justified only as part of the Third Reich's preparation for war against major countries. Pflugk-Harttung's network watched and reported on British shipping movements into and out of the Baltic Sea. In 1938, information revealed by Ernst Wollweber to the Danish authorities, along with further investigations by the police led to the arrest of Pflugk- Harttung,Armies of Spies, Author: Joseph Collomb, Published in 1939 by Macmillan, New York. Chapter 5, Franco's Fifth Column, page 89 along with eight other Germans and three Danes, who were charged with operating as spies in Copenhagen. Investigations proved that the spy ring had been involved in the sabotage and sinking of Spanish trawlers on behalf of General Francisco Franco and his Nationalist Navy, which was operating from German ports. The acts included the use of the spying apparatus to shell and sink the SS Cantabria off the Norfolk coast by the Nationalist Auxiliary cruiser Nadir. For his part in the espionage, Pflugk-Harttung was sentenced to only a year- and-a-half in prison and was released after a few months because of pressure from the German government. After his release from prison, Pflugk-Harttung became one of the leading German intelligence chiefs in Denmark.  World War II  In 1944, Pflugk-Harttung was in control of the in Bordeaux.National archives German intelligence officers He was arrested by US forces and taken to Arizona as a prisoner-of-war.

Born in Mallow, County Cork, Clancy first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Cork senior team. He joined the senior panel during the 1928 championship. Clancy subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won one All-Ireland medal, one Munster medal and one National Hurling League medal. Clancy was a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, however, he never won a Railway Cup medal. At club level Clancy enjoyed a lengthy career with Mallow. Throughout his career Clancy made 15 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1934 championship. Playing career =Club= Clancy played his club hurling with his local club in Mallow. The high point of his career, and indeed the highpoint of the club's history, came in 1928 when Mallow played √âire √ìg in the final of the senior county championship. Mallow, however, lost on that occasion. =Inter-county= Clancy first came to prominence on the inter- county scene as a member of the extended Cork panel in 1929. He was an unused substitute that year as Cork claimed Munster and All-Ireland honours following respective defeats of Waterford and Galway. On 6 July 1930 Clancy made his senior championship debut in a 6-6 to 5-6 Munster semi-final defeat by Clare. In spite of this defeat he finished off the year by winning a National Hurling League medal following a 3-5 to 3-0 defeat of Dublin the decider. Clancy won his first Munster medal on the field of play in 1931 following a 5-4 to 1-2 defeat of Waterford. 6 September 1931 saw Kilkenny face Cork in the All- Ireland final for the first time in five years. The first half was closely contested, with a goal from \\"Gah\\" Ahern helping Cork to a half-time lead of 1-3 to 0-2. Cork stretched the advantage to six points in the second half, but Kilkenny came storming back with a goal and then four points on the trot to take the lead by one point. In the dying moments Cork captain Eudie Coughlan got possession and made his way towards the goal. As he did so he slipped and fell but struck the sliotar while he was down on his knees, and it went over the bar for the equalising point. A 1-6 apiece draw was the result. 11 October 1931 was the date of the replay and proved to be just as exciting a contest as the first game. Kilkenny's Lory Meagher was playing the best hurling of his career at this time and scored a magnificent point from 90 yards out the field. In spite of this great effort a winner couldn‚Äôt be found and both sides finished level again at 2-5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, Eudie Coughlan rejected this. It was also suggested at a meeting of Central Council that both teams be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. As the All-Ireland saga went to a third meeting on 1 November 1931, Kilkenny's captain Meagher was ruled out of the game because of broken ribs sustained in the first replay. Such was the esteem in which he was held the game was virtually conceded to Cork since the star player couldn't play. In spite of fielding a younger team, Kilkenny were defeated by Cork on a score line of 5-8 to 3-4. The victory gave Clancy an All-Ireland medal on the field of play. On 8 July 1934 Clancy played his last game for Cork in a 3-4 to 2-2 Munster semi-final defeat by Limerick =Inter-provincial= Clancy also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1932, however, Munster were defeated by Leinster in the final of the Railway Cup. Clancy lined out again in 1933, however, Leinster triumphed once again. Personal life and death Clancy was born in Mallow, County Cork, the second of six children of Leitrim-born William and Julia (n√©e Callaghan). After completing his education, he worked with the Electricity Supply Board. Clancy married Abina O'Sullivan in September 1933. On 14 December 1967, Clancy died from colon cancer aged 61.

Shoshone Tribe of Indians of the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, 304 U.S. 111 (1938), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that mineral rights on a reservation belonged to the tribe, not the federal government.United States v. Shoshone Tribe of Indians, Background By the Treaty of July 2, 1863 the United States set apart for the Shoshone Tribe of Indians of the Wind River Reservation, a reservation of located in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. By the Treaty of July 3, 1868, the tribe ceded this reservation to the United States. The US agreed that definitely described acres called the \\"district of country\\" would be set aside for the absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Shoshone Indians. The US also agreed that no persons would be permitted to pass over, settle upon, or reside in that territory. The Shoshone Tribe subsequently made the reservation their permanent home. At the time the 1868 Treaty was made, the tribe consisted of full-blood Indians who were unable to read, write, or speak English. The reservation contained valuable mineral deposits of gold, oil, coal, and gypsum as well as over of timber. In 1904, the Shoshones and Arapahoes ceded to the US to be held by it in trust for the sale of timber, timber lands, and for the making of leases. The net proceeds were to be credited to the Indians. There were allotted to members of the tribes from 1907 to 1919. The Court found the fair value of a one-half interest of the Shoshone reservation of a total of , which was taken by the US for the Arapahoes on March 19, 1878 to be US$1,581,889.50. The lower court concluded that the tribe's interest in the land by the Treaty of 1868 included ownership of the mineral and timber rights. The Government appealed to the Supreme Court and asked for reversal with directions to determine the value of the Indians' right of use and occupancy excluding the value of any timber or minerals. Opinion of the Court Justice Pierce Butler delivered the opinion of the court. The case was argued March 21 and April 18, 1938 and was decided on April 25, 1938. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower court ruling and held that by the Treaty of 1868 the Shoshone Tribe had acquired the mineral and timber rights of the reservation. The Court reasoned that the minerals and standing timber were elements of the land itself and that for all practical purposes, the Tribe owned the land. The language of the Treaty did not suggest that the US intended to retain for itself any interest in the minerals or timber. The Court ultimately concluded that the lower court was correct in holding that the right of the Shoshone Tribe included the timber and minerals within the reservation.

It is descended from hunting hounds, especially Foxhounds, brought to America by settlers during the 17th and 18th centuries. The breed's first recognition came from the United Kennel Club in 1905 as the English Fox and Coonhound. Further recognition has been granted in recent years by the American Kennel Club, first in the Foundation Stock Service and in 2011 as a fully recognized member of the hound group. The breed is of medium height and proportionate weight, and their coats come predominantly in three types: redtick, bluetick, and a tricolor tick pattern. The English Coonhound has a high prey drive and, while it is typically used in 'coon hunting', it is also skilled in treeing. This breed is generally a healthy one, but it is recommended that prospective owners learn to recognize symptoms of bloat, as its large size and deep chest put them at risk of this condition. History The breed's ancestry can be traced back to Foxhounds brought to the United States by European settlers during the 17th and 18th centuries. It shares a common ancestry with all other coonhounds, with the exception of the Plott Hound. The breed developed from 'Virginia Hounds', which were developed over time from dogs imported to the United States by Robert Brooke, Thomas Walker and the first President of the United States, George Washington. The terrain here was much rougher than what they were used to, so the breed was specifically bred over time to better adapt to these new conditions. It was traditionally used to hunt raccoons by night and the American red fox by day. The United Kennel Club (UKC) first recognized it in 1905 as the English Fox and Coonhound. The Treeing Walker Coonhound was recognized separately by the UKC in 1945, separating it from the English Fox and Coonhound breed. The following year, the Bluetick Coonhound was also split into an entirely different breed. The English Coonhound was accepted into the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service as the American English Coonhound in 1995. On 1 January, 2010, it was moved up to the Miscellaneous Class. Following the recognition of the breed by the AKC in the hound group on 30 June 2011 as the 171st breed, the American English Coonhound became eligible to compete in the National Dog Show in 2011, followed by its eligibility for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship for the first time in 2012. Description A redticked English Coonhound. Male English Coonhounds measure between at the withers, with females being slightly smaller at . The weight of a Coonhound should be in proportion to the dog's height. Unlike the other breeds of coonhounds, a variety of colorations is acceptable to meet English Coonhound breed standards. Coloration can be redtick, bluetick, tricolored and tricolored with ticking. However, red markings are predominant and \\"Redtick\\" is a common term for English Coonhounds. Some believe this lack of emphasis on specific coloration has allowed breeders to focus breeding programs on traits such as intelligence and hunting ability rather than appearance and coat standards. Color variations are common even among pups from the same litter of English Coonhounds, indicating high levels of DNA diversity in the breed. The coat is short and coarse. Temperament English Coonhounds require regular exercise to keep in prime condition, but are generally mellow when not on the prey's tail. English Coonhounds usually make good house pets. However, they have a high prey drive and will go after small animals unless time is taken to train them otherwise. Because of this, they are not usually recommended for households with small pets unless they have been raised around small animals. They are generally good with children and tend to be very loyal dogs that are eager to please their owners. Like most puppies, younger English Coonhounds can be quite inquisitive and destructive- therefore, obedience training early on is highly recommended, as is providing them with plenty of attention and exercise. As they are known to bark when caged, crate training from a young age is strongly recommended, as well. Like all coonhounds, English are generally good natured and very sociable dogs. Skittishness or aggression is considered a defect, according to UKC breed standards. They are strong-willed, if not downright stubborn, and require more patience in training than other breeds. English Coonhounds are incessant nesters and should be avoided by people who do not wish to have dogs on their furniture. They make excellent family pets, as they have been bred to coexist amiably within a pack, as well as to be efficient hunters. English Coonhounds also make adequate watch dogs, as their vocalizations are characterized by melodious, drawn out bawls and short, explosive chops typical of Hound type dogs. =Hunting= The breed has proven popular with coon hunters and has a powerful nose which enables it to track both small and large game, including raccoons, cougars and bears. One of the types of hunting that the breed is used for is treeing, where the dogs are used to force climbing animals up into trees, where they can be cornered and shot by hunters. While known for their ability in this type of hunting, they can lose their ability to pace themselves and, on occasion, stand their ground when they believe that they have chased their prey up a tree, even if they haven't. They can have a one track mind while hunting and tune everything else out, including commands. Against cougars and bears, they can keep the larger game in position until the hunters arrive. They have become a favored breed in coon hunting. Health English Coonhounds can be prone to overheating while on coon hunts during the summer months in the Southern United States. Breeders who specialize in this breed screen their potential pairs for hip and elbow dysplasia, as well as any eye disorders. Like any other floppy-eared dog breed, the English Coonhound should have its ears checked frequently to ensure minimal wax and debris buildup. Owners should also learn the symptoms of bloat, as their large size and deep chest makes them susceptible to this life-threatening disease.

The Story of Anvil is a 2008 Canadian rockumentary film about the Canadian heavy metal band Anvil. The film is directed by screenwriter Sacha Gervasi, in his directorial debut, and features interviews with other musicians who have been influenced by the band, including Slash, Tom Araya, Lemmy, Scott Ian, and Lars Ulrich. Synopsis The film begins by listing the headlining acts of the Super Rock festival held in Japan in 1984: Scorpions, Whitesnake, and Bon Jovi, all of whom have gone on to sell millions of records, except one: Anvil. Despite their ambition, the Canadian band was unable to achieve the same level of success. Instead, singer and guitarist Steve \\"Lips\\" Kudlow drives trucks for Children's Choice Catering, delivering food to schools and institutions. Drummer Robb Reiner works in construction. But both would rather be playing on stage at the local sports bar to their small but dedicated group of fans, as shown during a show for Steve's 50th birthday party. Kudlow gets an email from a European fan named Tiziana Arrigoni, who offers to set up a European tour for the band, estimating 1500 Euros per show. The tour has a promising start at the Sweden Rock festival, where the group interacts with Michael Schenker and Carmine Appice, but it quickly goes downhill. Trains are full before the band can buy tickets, they miss travel connections altogether, they get lost in Prague due to language barriers and scuffle with the bar owner who refuses to pay since the band was two hours late, they play to mostly empty rooms and complain about the lack of promotion, and eventually run out of money and sleep in a train station. At one point, Reiner refuses to perform and announces he's quitting the band, only to be persuaded by Kudlow to stick it out. The final concert of the tour is the Monsters of Transylvania rock concert, held in a 10,000 seat arena and promising a crowd of 5,000. Only 174 people show up. The band returns to Canada having taken five weeks off of work and making no money. Kudlow describes the financial difficulties that have befallen the band, including his own second mortgage, and bassist Glenn Five's homelessness. Guitarist Ivan Hurd ends up marrying Tiziana, and Anvil plays at the wedding reception as a handful of family members watch politely. Reiner describes his other passion, painting, focusing on themes of solitude. Kudlow notes that recent Anvil albums have not been as well written or produced as earlier efforts, such as Metal on Metal, and sends a rough demo tape to the producer of that record, Chris \\"CT\\" Tsangarides. Tsangarides replies to Kudlow that he feels the songs have potential, and after a face-to-face meeting they decide to record their 13th album, This Is Thirteen. The band still needs to raise the ¬£13,000 to finance the recording. He returns to Canada and tries to raise the money as a telemarketer selling sunglasses, but does not make a single sale. Eventually, he borrows the money from his sister Rhonda. The band spends over a month recording in Dover, England. After several stressful weeks of recording, an argument ensues between Kudlow and Reiner over the quality of each other's recording takes. The argument turns heated and Reiner threatens to quit again, but they are able to reconcile and finish recording the album. Kudlow and Reiner try unsuccessfully to market it to several record labels (notably EMI Canada), but decide to sell the album themselves through Internet and concert sales. Despite the lack of major label distribution, Kudlow considers the recording process and finished album a success, stating that the band was able to stay true to their roots and form/maintain strong relationships with family and friends. Kudlow receives a phone call asking Anvil to play a concert in Japan. Excitedly, the group returns to the site that marked the highlight of their career. Their spirits are dampened when they realize they are the very first act at a three-day festival, taking the stage at 11:35 am. Fearing disaster, the group however takes the stage to a large, receptive crowd. Production Gervasi first met Anvil on September 21, 1982, after a gig at The Marquee Club in London, where he introduced himself to the band as \\"England's number-one Anvil fan.\\" He subsequently became a roadie for the band on their '82, '84 and '85 tours, and was given the nickname \\"Teabag\\" by the band. He reunited with Anvil after a break of 20 years, and started shooting a documentary about them in November 2005. Release The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2008, and won Audience Awards at the 2008 Sydney Film Festival, Los Angeles Film Festival and Galway International Film Festival. The film has been nominated in the \\"Truer Than Fiction\\" category of Film Independent's 2009 Independent Spirit Awards. The award recognizes emerging directors of non-fiction films. Since its first season, VH1 Classic's That Metal Show has supported the film, and on March 28, 2009, Kudlow and Reiner were the show's featured guests. It was picked up for distribution in the United States by VH1 under their VH1 Rock Docs label, and opened to limited release on April 10, 2009. The band also went on the road with the film for what was dubbed The Anvil Experience. In North America, the film was released on DVD on October 6, 2009. Distribution was handled by Fontana Distribution on behalf of VH1. Reception The film has received praise and high acclaim in many reviews, receiving a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Times called it \\"possibly the greatest film yet made about rock and roll\\". The film was named Best Documentary of 2009 at the Evening Standard British Film Awards in London. Chris Martin of Coldplay presented the award. The film won Best Documentary at the 2010 Independent Spirit Awards in Los Angeles. It also won an Emmy for Outstanding Arts & Culture Programming in 2010. Steve Kudlow: \\"One of my heroes is Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull, and he came up to me in Heathrow Airport and told me the movie had completely inspired him to keep playing music, and he just kept thanking me for all of the inspiration my band gave him. I mean, this is Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull‚Äîhow cool is that?\\" Impact Since the release of the film, the band has received a second wave of popularity and success. This includes an appearance at Download Festival 2009 headlining the Tuborg stage and support slots for both AC/DC and Saxon. The band also performed on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien around this time. Anvil toured the US in 2010.

Born in Turners Cross, Cork, Madden first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-two when he first linked up with the Cork senior team. He made his senior debut during the 1928 championship. Madden immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won three All-Ireland medals, three Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. At club level Madden played with Redmonds. Throughout his career Madden made 18 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1932 championship. Playing career =Inter-county= Madden made his senior championship debut for Cork on a 15 July 1928 in a 2-2 apiece Munster final draw with the Clare. He retained his place on the starting fifteen for the replay a fortnight later. Cork won that game by 6-4 to 2-2, giving Madden a first Munster medal. On 9 September 1928 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland decider. The Westerners, who got a bye into the final without lifting a hurley, were no match as a rout ensued. Mick \\"Gah\\" Ahern ran riot scoring 5-4, a record for an All-Ireland final, as Cork triumphed by 6-12 to 1-0. It was Madden's first All-Ireland medal. Madden won a second Munster medal in 1929 as Cork made it four-in-a-row following a 4-6 to 2-3 defeat of Waterford. On 1 September 1929 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland final for the second successive year. Little had changed in a year as Cork were on the top of their game again. A rout ensued as \\"the Rebels\\" and Madden claimed a second All- Ireland title following a 4-9 to 1-3 victory. Cork exited the championship at the first hurdle in 1930, however, Madden finished the year by winning a second league medal following a 3-5 to 3-0 defeat of Dublin the decider. Madden won a third Munster medal in 1931 following a 5-4 to 1-2 defeat of Waterford. 6 September 1931 saw Kilkenny face Cork in the All-Ireland final for the first time in five years. The first half was closely contested, with a goal from \\"Gah\\" Ahern helping Cork to a half-time lead of 1-3 to 0-2. Cork stretched the advantage to six points in the second half, but Kilkenny came storming back with a goal and then four points on the trot to take the lead by one point. In the dying moments Cork captain Eudie Coughlan got possession and made his way towards the goal. As he did so he slipped and fell but struck the sliotar while he was down on his knees, and it went over the bar for the equalising point. A 1-6 apiece draw was the result. 11 October 1931 was the date of the replay and proved to be just as exciting a contest as the first game. Kilkenny's Lory Meagher was playing the best hurling of his career at this time and scored a magnificent point from 90 yards out the field. In spite of this great effort a winner couldn‚Äôt be found and both sides finished level again at 2-5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, Eudie Coughlan rejected this. It was also suggested at a meeting of Central Council that both teams be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. As the All-Ireland saga went to a third meeting on 1 November 1931, Kilkenny's captain Meagher was ruled out of the game because of broken ribs sustained in the first replay. Such was the esteem in which he was held the game was virtually conceded to Cork since the star player couldn't play. In spite of fielding a younger team, Kilkenny were defeated by Cork on a score line of 5-8 to 3-4. It was Madden's third and final All-Ireland medal.

As a child, Sweetland drew cartoons for the Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts for several years. After graduating high school in 1992, he opted to attend California Institute of the Arts and pursue his lifelong love and passion for animation. In 1994, he decided to leave school in his final year to join Pixar. His first assignment was as an animator on Toy Story. He continued as animator on A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2. He was nominated for an Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Character Animation for the film. Sweetland continued to build a reputation as one of the best animators in the business. He was awarded back-to-back Annie Awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Character Animation for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo. He took on the lead animator role for Bud Luckey's Oscar-nominated Boundin' and worked as an animator and storyboard artist on the Oscar-winning The Incredibles. Sweetland followed this up by stepping into the supervising animator role on John Lasseter's Cars. In 2007, Sweetland pitched a short film about a sympathetic magician who gets \\"dumped\\" by his rabbit. This eventually evolved to a more slapstick film (and a throwback to Warner Bros. classic Looney Tunes). Teddy Newton was brought on board to design the characters; it emerged as Sweetland's directorial debut. Presto was very well received by audiences and critics alike when it preceded WALL-E in theaters. It was honored in 2008 with an Academy Award nomination in the Best Animated Short Film category. It was included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2008. After finishing Presto, Sweetland then left Pixar in 2009. On September 24, 2010, it was reported that Sweetland had been hired by Sony Pictures Animation to direct a computer-animated film adaptation of The Familiars novel series; that project has been cancelled. In January 2013, it was reported that Warner Bros. was developing the computer-animated feature film Storks under their newly created Warner Animation Group banner, conceived and written by Nicholas Stoller, with Sweetland set to direct. In April 2015, Warner Bros. announced that the film, which Sweetland co-directed with Stoller, would be released on September 23, 2016.

Van Voorst (born 5 June 1952) is an American theologian and educator. He retired in 2018 as a Professor of New Testament Studies at Western Theological Seminary, in Holland, Michigan, and has published scholarly works in early Christian writings and New Testament Greek. He received his B.A. in Religion from Hope College in Holland, Michigan, his M.Div. from Western Theological Seminary, and his Ph.D. in New Testament from Union Theological Seminary in New York City. He has served at Lycoming College (Methodist) in Williamsport, PA, and was a visiting professor at Westminster College, Oxford, England. He has lectured to PhD students in Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, on methods in biblical study. Van Voorst has also served as a supply pastor at various PC (USA) churches in north-central Pennsylvania, and for twelve years as pastor at Rochester Reformed Church, New York.  Works  = Jesus Outside the New Testament = In Jesus Outside the New Testament (2000), Van Voorst starts by outlining the history of research into extra-Biblical sources for the historical Jesus and its relation to the hypothesis that Jesus did not exist, which he notes is generally rejected by modern scholars. He goes on to consider references to Jesus in classical writings, Jewish writings, hypothetical sources of the canonical Gospels, and extant Christian writings outside the New Testament. The book includes translations of key passages discussed, including the entire Gospel of Thomas. Van Voorst concludes that non-Christian sources provide \\"a small but certain corroboration of certain New Testament historical traditions on the family background, time of life, ministry, and death of Jesus\\", as well as \\"evidence of the content of Christian preaching that is independent of the New Testament\\", while extra-biblical Christian sources give access to \\"some important information about the earliest traditions on Jesus\\". However, New Testament sources remain central for \\"both the main lines and the details about Jesus' life and teaching\\". Allen Kerkeslager called the book a \\"marvelous achievement\\" and commended its clear organization. He criticised Van Voorst for using divergences from the canonical Gospels as evidence against the historical value of the New Testament apocrypha, but noted that the author usually offered additional grounds for his conclusions. Darrell L. Bock called the book \\"an excellent up-to-date survey\\", \\"careful and thorough\\". Helen E. Bond considered Van Voorst's treatment of the New Testament apocrypha particularly strong, while Curt Niccum found his book generally useful but least good on Jewish literature. G. Van Belle criticised Van Voorst's assignment of to the Signs Gospel against the verdict of two authors cited in the book. Van Voorst's attitude towards the New Testament provoked divergent judgments. Thomas O'Loughlin, while concluding that the book was up-to-date and generally balanced, thought that an apologetic agenda had led Van Voorst to place the New Testament \\"almost outside of history\\" and to simplistically classify non-canonical Christian texts as \\"gnostic\\". On the other hand, some reviewers in Evangelical journals criticised what they saw as an over- skeptical attitude towards the New Testament, in one case recommending works by F. F. Bruce and Gary Habermas as superior in this respect.

Weeks, 430 U.S. 73 (1977), was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court.  Background  On appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, the appellants, federally recognized Native American Tribe and the Secretary of the Interior, challenged a judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma granting appellee, unrecognized Native American tribe, an injunction in an action seeking a declaration that appellee's exclusion from an award violated the United States Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. The Delaware Indians, who originally resided in the Northeastern United States, were gradually forced to move westward in the 19th century, and the tribe became geographically scattered. One group, the Cherokee Delawares, which initially had settled on a Kansas reservation as part of the tribe's main body, eventually moved to \\"Indian Country\\" in Oklahoma, became assimilated with the Cherokees, and is today a federally recognized tribe. Another group, the Absentee Delawares, which never joined the main body in Kansas but migrated to Oklahoma and settled with the Wichita and Caddo Indians, is also a federally recognized tribe. A third group, the Kansas Delawares, lived with the main body on the Kansas reservation but remained in Kansas when the Cherokee Delawares moved to Oklahoma; under an 1866 treaty, the Kansas Delawares elected to become UScitizens and to receive individual parcels of land in Kansas but had to dissolve their relationship with the tribe and participate in tribal assets only to the extent of a \\"just proportion\\" of the tribe's credits \\"then held in trust by the United States;\\" and the descendants of this group are not a federally recognized tribe. The funds were being distributed to redress the breach of a tribal land treaty and appellee alleged that its exclusion violated its equal protection rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The district court rendered judgment in favor of appellee and enjoined further distributions. The appellate court affirmed and appellants sought review. The Court reversed, ruling that Congress's omission of appellee from the distribution did not offend due process and but tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward the Indians. The appellee was not a recognized tribal entity but was simply individual Indians with no vested rights in any tribal property. The statute distributed tribal, not individually-owned, property. The appellee had previously been excluded from a distribution of tribal assets. Congress deliberately limited the distribution under the statute to avoid problems that might attend a wider distribution. The question was whether the Kansas Delawares were denied equal protection of the laws in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Kansas Delawares were excluded from the distribution of funds authorized by an Act of Congress, whixhprovided for distribution of funds only to the Absentee Delawares and Cherokee, pursuant to an award by the Indian Claims Commission, to redress a breach by the United States of an 1854 treaty with the Delaware tribe.  Decision  *\\"The power of Congress over Indian Affairs may be of a plenary nature, but it is not absolute.\\" US v.

Balanchine had made three versions of the ballet, premiered in 1948, 1966 and 1982 respectively. The first version, a pas de deux, premiered on April 28, 1948 at the City Center of Music and Drama, during a Ballet Society performance, with dancers Tanaquil Le Clercq and Pat McBride, and violist Emanuel Vardi. Stravinsky described this version as a preview of a pas de deux from the ballet Orpheus. The second version is a solo which premiered on July 15, 1966 at the Philharmonic Hall, performed by dancer Suzanne Farrell and violist Jesse Levine, in a program about Stravinsky directed by Lukas Foss. The New York City Ballet premiered it later that month with the same cast. The last version, again with Farrell, premiered on June 13, 1982 at the New York State Theater, as part of NYCB's Stravinsky Centennial Celebration, with Warren Laffredo playing the viola on stage. Balanchine died the following year. It was not revived until 2012 at the Vail Dance Festival, danced by Pacific Northwest Ballet's Carla K√∂rbes. Artistic director of the festival Damian Woetzel learned the choreography via tapes of Farrell, then taught it to K√∂rbes. In 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the festival streamed video of the 2012 performance online.

Kyle is the son of the show's protagonist, Lieutenant Horatio Caine. He has been occupied as a student and a city morgue assistant, and is currently a soldier in the United States Army.  Background  Kyle Harmon was born on July 6, 1991, to \\"John Walden\\" (undercover alias of Horatio Caine at the time) and Julia Eberly in Pensacola, Florida. Through unknown events, Harmon ended up in the foster care system. Around age 15, Harmon (now living in Miami) stole a boat on Biscayne Bay and was arrested for the offense. The crime was alcohol-related. He served six months in juvenile detention then was released on parole with an ankle- bracelet monitor. Harmon's parole officer, Andrew Bennet, secured him a job at the Miste Cafe, where he was coerced into committing a felony by another parolee and co-worker, and was sent to an adult prison to await trial. Kyle didn't know who his father was, but a dangerous escapee found out by chance. In retribution against Caine, this prisoner arranged to have Kyle kidnapped and hidden within the prison. Lt. Caine told Kyle about their relationship when he located and freed him from a maintenance tunnel next to Block C. Caine then arranged protection for Kyle by another prisoner. The background of Kyle's last name remains unclear.  Personal life  In \\"Dangerous Son,\\" parole officer Andrew Bennet is murdered and Harmon, having recently broken his parole agreement to abstain from alcohol, is brought in for questioning. While being interrogated by Eric Delko, Horatio Caine spots the boy and suspects a biological relationship, previously unknown to both parties. Meanwhile, Harmon kidnaps a woman named Kathleen Newbury and demands cash for her ransom. It is later revealed that Kyle had been blackmailed into the crime by a fellow employee at the Miste Cafe. Nevertheless, Harmon is arrested after running from the Coast Guard. While in prison, Harmon finds himself a prime target by the gangsters after it is known that his father is a police officer. He is kidnapped by Joe LeBrock and left to die in a maintenance pipeline. He is rescued by Caine, who then proceeds to reveal his paternal relationship to Harmon. From then on, Harmon is protected by Oscar Monahan who is acting on Caine's orders. However, when Monahan is murdered by a bomb triggered by the cellphone found in Harmon's bunk, the boy becomes a prime suspect. He is questioned by his father, but Harmon claims to not know anything about the phone. Caine later realizes that Harmon lied, and that the phone did belong to him, but unknown to him, it had been rigged by LeBrock's men. Caine still manages to prove Harmon's innocence in the murder of Oscar Monahan. Harmon's day in court arrives, and he finds himself amongst his father and his mother, Julia Winston, who has suddenly reappeared. The key witness in Harmon's case does not appear, and the judge dismisses the charges. The judge also informs Harmon that both his parents have filed separate petitions for custody for him, and that he must choose with whom he will live. Although he appears to struggle with the decision, Harmon ultimately chooses to go with his mother. During the events of \\"Bombshell,\\" Caine breaks up a fistfight between Harmon and his adult neighbor. This neighbor ultimately ends up murdered, and Harmon once again becomes a suspect. Harmon insists to Caine that he had nothing to do with the murder, but is hesitant when Caine starts question whether Harmon's mother could have had anything to do with it. The murderer is revealed to be neither Harmon nor his mother, and both walk free. Harmon is brought to the station after being pulled over while driving erratically with his mother in the passenger seat. Caine finds out that Harmon was attempting to get his mother to her job interview on time and she was the one who had continually told him to go faster despite his protests. It becomes clear at this point that Winston is psychologically unstable. Attempting to give him some stability and to get him away from his mother, Caine secures Harmon a job as the ME Dr. Tara Price's assistant. Although Harmon breaks the protocol the first day by letting Winston visit the morgue without permission, Tara allows him to keep his job and he seems to enjoy it. He again unknowingly breaks protocol the first day when he answers a murder victim's cell phone while it rings. In doing so however, he breaks the case wide open. Caine explains that while he broke the case, he shouldn't touch others' personal effects without clearance as it may be potential evidence. Caine also sets up Harmon in his own apartment, explaining that in living there comes a greater responsibility. Harmon catches Tara taking a pill and confronts her about it. She lies, and he calls her on it, to which she angrily responds, \\"I don't have to explain myself to you, Kyle.\\" During \\"Collateral Damage,\\" a grenade explodes in the morgue, throwing Ryan Wolfe, Tara Price, and Harmon across the room. No one is injured, but Harmon is extremely shaken up. He expresses to Wolfe that he feels responsible for the grenade because he knocked it out of the victim's clothes but Wolfe tells him that accidents always happen. During \\"Dissolved,\\" Harmon expresses to Caine that he is struggling to cope with his mother's psychological instability. Winston appears to be calling Harmon nonstop, as well as going into his apartment uninvited. Winston eventually breaks into the morgue, where Tara, Wolfe, Harmon, and an unnamed intern are, and starts shooting. She waves the gun around and demands that Harmon come with her. Harmon agrees to go if she will put the gun down. The scene is interrupted by Caine, who tries to talk sense into Winston. Instead of listening, Winston says goodbye to Harmon and puts the gun to her head. Harmon screams \\"No!\\" and lunges forward, but the act is ultimately stopped by Caine, who grabs the gun before Winston can pull the trigger. Winston is arrested while Harmon looks on, obviously hurt and disappointed. In the Season 8 episode \\"Into the Wind\\" (aired on February 1, 2010), Harmon is seen via Skype from a U.S. Army forward operating base outside Kabul, Afghanistan, where it's revealed to viewers that he's joined the armed forces. He reassures his father that he's made the right choice, but of course, Caine privately feels otherwise. In the episode \\"Dishonor,\\" Harmon has returned to Miami from Afghanistan. At the start of the episode he tells his father that he has decided to return to Afghanistan. Caine is immediately disappointed and worried, and also upset that Harmon did not make the decision with him. Later, Harmon discovers a body on fire and believes it to be his military friend, Brian, who had also returned home. It is soon discovered to be another man, but Brian is still missing. Harmon receives a call from Brian, who asks him to meet him but not to tell Caine. Harmon agrees, but tells Caine anyway. At the end of the episode, Harmon is shown in uniform, ready to return to Afghanistan. He says goodbye to Caine, and offers his hand for a handshake. Caine instead hugs him, tells him he loves him, and that he must come home alive. He is seen briefly in the episode \\"Friendly Fire\\", however the dialogue was not heard.  Personality  Kyle Harmon is portrayed as impetuous but good-hearted. He is shown to be courageous, and takes any implication of cowardice as a personal insult (\\"Dangerous Son.\\") He has respect for the law, but is not afraid to break it when he feels it necessary (\\"Dangerous Son\\", \\"Chain Reaction\\", \\"Bombshell\\", \\"Divorce Party.\\") He is extremely independent, and often tries to take care of problems even when they are over his head (\\"Bombshell\\", \\"Divorce Party.\\") Harmon shares many qualities and mannerisms with Caine, but is also different from him. Most notably, Kyle is openly emotional and very impatient. He tends to \\"wear his heart on his sleeve.\\" Caine, on the other hand, is extremely reserved and almost unnaturally patient.  Relationships  Horatio Caine (David Caruso): Kyle Harmon met his father when he was sixteen. He is distrustful of him at first, thinking that Caine will abandon him \\"just like all the others.\\" However, as his mother's condition deteriorates, Harmon seems to grow closer to his father, especially after his father gets him a job as the ME's assistant. By the seventh season, Harmon seems to gravitate more towards Caine, as evidenced by his confessions of the problems with his mother to him. During the eighth season, Caine and Harmon seem to have a close relationship, and Harmon shows great trust in Caine. When Harmon leaves for Afghanistan the second time, Caine tells him that he loves him. Julia Eberly - Winston (Elizabeth Berkley): Harmon is very happy to see his mother when she first appears in \\"Raising Caine,\\" as he has been looking for her for some time. When Julia and Horatio file separate custody suits for him, he ultimately chooses his mother. For a while Harmon is quite protective of his mother. However, as time goes on and Winston's mental condition worsens, Harmon appears to grow somewhat weary of Winston's unpredictable temperament. The breaking point comes after she goes on a rampage in the penultimate episode of season 7 (\\"Dissolved\\") and demands Harmon at gunpoint to return with her. He is obviously disappointed as he watches his father have her arrested and later sent to rehab. During the eighth season, Winston is not mentioned by Harmon or Caine, and it is implied that Harmon no longer has much of a relationship, if any at all, with his mother.

It is given a different name to avoid confusion with the hardware ESN stored in the phone. In all known systems the UIMID displaces the ESN in signaling (based on setting bit 1 of the 'UsgInd' field to '1' in the card). Because the UIMID is allocated from the same numbering space as ESN its existence is transparent to the network. The reason the UIMID is transmitted instead of the ESN is because the card contains the MIN or IMSI and devices such as the HLR running the Asbi mobility management protocol insist on a static association between these identifiers for subscription validation. The HLR will store the MIN or IMSI alongside the ESN in each record, and if an ANSI-41 message is received containing a different pair it will be rejected as invalid. UIMID codes are allocated by the TIA using industry-defined guidelines and with codes that have been transferred from the ESN administrator (also the TIA).3GPP2 SC.R4004-0, Version 2.0. May, 2010. User Identification Module ID Manufacturer‚Äôs Code Assignment Guidelines and Procedures ESN and UIMID codes were exhausted by late 2008 at which point only reclaimed codes could be assigned to manufacturers including portions of blocks assigned to manufacturers but never used and portions used for technologies other than CDMA2000. The TIA stopped accepting applications for UIMID blocks on June 30, 2010. Only one assignment has been made since 2010. The replacement identifier for UIMID is EUIMID although for backwards compatibility a pseudo-UIMID (pUIMID) is still retained in cards. The pUIMID is composed of the prefix 0x80 to make it distinct from unique UIMID codes and a 24-bit SHA-1 hash of the EUIMID. pUIMID codes are not unique as there are only 224 of them and many times more EUIMID codes. The pUIMID can usually be used in place of a unique UIMID, except when uniqueness is important.

Their state was the most powerful Arab amirate in Armenia after the collapse of the ostikanate of Arminiya in the late 9th century. Origin The Kaysites were members of the Hejazi Banu Sulaym tribe, which had settled in the Jazira after the Muslim conquest. By the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786‚Äì809) the Sulaym had probably advanced into the region around Lake Van. Manzikert and the surrounding regions, however, weren't in Arab hands until the rebellion of the Armenians against the Arab ostikan (governor) in 850. This rebellion prompted the caliph al-Mutawakkil (842‚Äì861) to send the Turk Bugha al-Kabir into Armenia with an army. Bugha defeated the leading princes of Armenia and took several prisoner, before departing the country in 855. His defeat of the Armenian princes had enabled the Sulaym Arabs to surge into the area of Apahunik', which included the city of Manzikert. By 860 the region had fallen under the control of the first Kaysite amir, Abu'l-Ward. Suzerains For most their existence of the Kaysite state, the amirs recognized their stronger neighbors as suzerains, though often these declarations were only nominal and in effect the Kaysites were independent. When Abu'l-Ward took control of Apahunik', the ostikanate of Arminiya was still extant. As a result, Abu'l-Ward, as with all the other Arab and Armenian rulers in Armenia, were subject to the caliph's ostikans. The ostikans served as protectors of the Kaysites, and relations between them were overall friendly. When a pan-Arab coalition led by the ostikans against the increasingly powerful Christian princes of Armenia in the late 870s was formed, Abu'l-Ward was one of its most powerful members. The ultimate failure of the coalition against the Christian Armenians foreshadowed the end of the Arminiyan ostikanate in the next decade. In place of the ostikans, in 885 the caliph al-Mu'tamid (870‚Äì892) sent a crown to the Bagratid prince Ashot I, thereby restoring the Kingdom of Armenia. This move made the Kaysites subject to Ashot,Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 54 who Abu'l-Ward was on bad terms with. By the late 890s the reigns of both Ashot and Abu'l-Ward were at an end; Ashot was succeeded by his son Smbat I (890‚Äì912) while Abu'l-Ward's three grandsons eventually assumed power. When Smbat I fell into difficulties early in his reign Abu'l-Ward's grandsons revolted against his authority but were defeated in battle. They were forced to resume paying tribute to the king and to send hostages.Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 65-6 Smbat I was murdered by the Sajid amir of Azerbaijan in 912 and was eventually succeeded by his son Ashot II (914‚Äì928). During the civil war following Smbat's death the Kaysites ceased to recognize the suzerainty of the Bagratids.Ter- Ghewondyan, p. 74 At the same time, however, the Byzantine Empire became active in Armenian affairs. The proximity of the Byzantines compelled the three grandsons of Abu'l-Ward to begin forwarding tribute to the Empire.Ter- Ghewondyan, p. 81 Other than the tribute, Byzantine authority over the Kaysites was restricted, although periodic raids by them into Kaysite territory are recorded.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 82 In 940 the Hamdanid amir Sayf al- Daula came to Ahlat, where the Kaysite amirs pledged allegiance to him.Ter- Ghewondyan, pp. 85-6 From this point on the Kaysites were Hamdanid vassals, and remained so until the end of their rule in 964. Kaysite rulers The first Kaysite amir, Abu'l-Ward, ruled from c. 860 until probably the 890s. He was a very active statesman and under him the Kaysites became very influential in Armenia, being rivaled only by the Bagratids, the Artsrunis of Vaspurakan and the princes of Syunik.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 53 He took Ahlat from the prince of TaronTer-Ghewondyan, p. 55 and, as mentioned above, was one of the leaders of the Arab coalition formed against the Christian princes of Armenia. Even after the coalition was defeated Abu'l-Ward remained active in Armenian affairs; he convinced the Artsruni prince of Vaspurakan to seize and imprison Ashot, the prince of Taron. At the same time, Ashot I (who had not yet been crowned king) invaded Kaysite territory and besieged Manzikert but, when he heard about Ashot of Taron's fate, lifted the siege and headed to Vaspurakan to save him.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 59 Abu'l-Ward was succeeded by his son 'Abd al- Hamid, who ruled for only a short time.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 65 He was succeeded by his three sons. The eldest, Abu Sawada, received the chief city of Manzikert, as well as Koroy Jor and Hark'. The second brother, Abu'l-Aswad gained Arces, Ahlat and Arcke, while the third, Abu Salim, received territory in the northwest portion of the Kaysite lands.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 80 Relations between the brothers was amicable and, despite this division, the Kaysite state continued to function as one unified unit. It was these three brothers who unsuccessfully rebelled against Smbat I in the late 890s. During this period of joint rule the Kaysite domains were expanded, with the conquest of Berkri from the Arab Uthmanids in the early 10th century. Some time in the early 10th century the eldest brother, Abu Sawada, died and was succeeded by his son 'Abd al-Rahim. Upon 'Abd al-Rahim's death, his brother Abu'l-Mu'izz was too young to rule so Manzikert and the other lands fell into the hands of Abu'l-Aswad, ruler of Ahlat. When Abu'l-Aswad himself died, his territories were split; the lands he had inherited from 'Abd al-Rahim (including Manzikert) were taken by his remaining brother, Abu Salim, while his original possessions (centered on Ahlat) fell to his adopted son Ahmad. The Kaysite lands were now in the hands of two rulers instead of three. It was around this time that the Kaysites became Hamdanid vassals.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 89 When Abu Salim died, his son Abu'l-Ward [II] inherited his territories. Abu'l-Ward killed Ahmad and took over his possessions, thereby unifying the Kaysite lands. This took place before 952, since this was when the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus completed his work De Administrando Imperio which covers many of these events. Abu'l-Ward remained the sole ruler of the Kaysite amirate until his death. In 964 he was probably murdered by a ghulam of Sayf al-Daula named Nadja who had risen in revolt. Nadja and his two brothers ruled the Kaysite lands until Sayf al-Daula had Nadja murdered. The Hamdanid amir then led an army into Armenia, captured Nadja's brothers and secured his rule over the former territories of the Kaysites. This done, he departed from Armenia in the beginning of 966. The Kaysite lands thereby came under the rule of Sayf al-Daula.Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 89-90 Aspects of the Kaysite amirates The Arabs of southwest Armenia never constituted a majority of the regional population. Most of the Muslims, who were probably (like the Kaysites) Sulaym ArabsTer-Ghewondyan, p. 133 resided in the cities. Consequentially, the Kaysite amirs rule was strongest in the cities that were under their control. Their power was much weaker in the surrounding rural areas, which generally remained under the control of local (Christian) leaders.Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 81-2 Given that the Muslims formed a minority within the Kaysite amirate, the Armenian Christians were given a degree of autonomy when it came to dealing with their own private affairs. Although the sharia prevailed in the governance of Muslims, when resolving issues amongst themselves most Armenians living under the Kaysites followed the canons of the Armenian Church.Since the Bagratid kingdom had no civil code, Armenians living in Christian territory were similarly governed by the rules of the Church. Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 145 In the early years of the Kaysite amirate, the T'ondrakian religious sect was active in the provinces of Apahunik' and Hark'. The T'ondrakians were opposed to both the Armenian Church and the Muslim amirs of Armenia. Abu'l-Ward [I], considering them a threat to his rule, slaughtered a large number of them and executed their leader Smbat Zarehawanc'i. Despite this, the T'ondrakian movement survived into the 11th century and caused trouble for both Armenian ecclesiastical and Byzantine authorities.Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 135-7 Several Kaysite cities lay on the southern of two commercial routes that traversed Armenia from east to west.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 139 The traders that passed through Armenia therefore benefited the Kaysite lands. Despite this, the cities of the Kaysites never became major urban centers. Even Manzikert, the capital, was never considered to be a very prosperous city.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 132 Militarily, the Kaysites benefited from a regular influx of ghazi warriors on their way to fight the holy war against the Byzantine Empire. These warriors would travel through Apahunik', which was controlled by the Kaysites, then make their way to Karin, a chief Muslim outpost against the Byzantines. The Kaysites often utilized these ghazi volunteers to reinforce their own army against their enemies. For example, during the revolt of Abu Sawada, Abu'l-Aswad and Abu Salim against Smbat I, the Kaysite army was supported by \\"Persian raiders who were making attacks on the Greeks [Byzantines].\\"Ter- Ghewondyan, p. 66 Aftermath of Kaysite rule Hamdanid rule over the former Kaysite territories did not last long. After Sayf al-Daula's death in 967 the fate of the Kaysite lands is unknown for a time, although they were probably in the hands of local rulers.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 105 In 969 a Byzantine army raided Apahunik', besieged Manzikert and razed its walls, but the Byzantines made no attempt to maintain a presence in the city. The Bagratid kings eventually gained control of the northern portion of the Kaysite realm. The Artsruni king of Vaspurakan attempted to take the remaining Kaysite lands, including Berkri, Manzikert and Ahlat, though without much success.Ter- Ghewondyan, p. 106 Around this time Ahlat and Manzikert were conquered by a Kurdish family, that of the Marwanids. Its leader, Badh ibn Dustak, took advantage of a civil war within the Byzantine Empire and the weakness of the Hamdanids and created a powerful principality stretching from Manzikert to Mosul. Badh's successes proved to be temporary, however, and when he was killed in 990 while attempting to retake Mosul the Marwanid amirate quickly shrank. Most of the former Kaysite lands in their possession were taken by the Georgian Bagrationi King David III, Curopalates of Tao.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 112 Only Ahlat remained in the hands of the Marwanids.Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 115 David held Apahunik' until his death in 1000. As per agreement with the Byzantines, his domain was incorporated into the Empire. Manzikert henceforth remained in Byzantine hands until the coming of the Seljuks in the mid-11th century.

Since the 1980s, Arsenal's fans have often been referred to as Gooners, a derivation from the team's nickname, the \\"Gunners\\". Many fanzines, blogs, podcasts and fans websites have been dedicated to the club and the fans have long-standing rivalries with several other clubs; the most notable of which is with near neighbours Tottenham Hotspur, with whom they regularly contest the North London derby. The club and the fans have regularly featured in portrayals of football in British culture but Gunners fans come from far and wide; a 2005 report estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 27 million, the third-largest in the world. A September 2011 report estimated Arsenal's fanbase at 100 million worldwide, still making them the third-largest team in terms of supporters. Arsenal fans have long been stereotyped for the dissatisfaction they appear to feel - and express - towards their club. Sometimes the regular low-level grumbling will erupt, with severe criticisms and bitter feelings being aired. An example of this in the 2010s was a vociferous group - dubbed \\"The Anti-Arsenal Arsenal\\" - that had manager Ars√®ne Wenger as the principle target of their dissatisfactions. However, the perception of Arsenal fans as being hard to please is an old one. Even at times of success antagonism was noted. Such was the experience of the title winning teams of 1953 and 1971. Not even the figure behind the legendary 1930s team successes was spared: Herbert Chapman complained of the activities of the \\"boo-boys\\" and title-winning George Graham was vociferously criticized over choice of players and tactical strategy. In 2010 Arsenal supporters became the first fans of a Premier League club able to buy percentages of a stake in Arsenal through a \\"fanshare\\" scheme, therefore giving them rights to attend shareholders meetings. Demographics Arsenal's performance in home matches have resulted in them having the second-highest average League attendance for an English club during the 2007‚Äì08 season, (60,069, which was 99.5% of available capacity), and as of 2006, the fourth-highest all-time average attendance. Please note that some pre-war attendance figures used by this source were estimates and may not be entirely accurate. Arsenal have the highest proportion (7.7%) of non-white attending supporters of any club in English football, according to a 2002 report. There are supporters' clubs worldwide. A 2005 report by Granada Ventures, which at the time owned a 9.9% stake in the club, estimated Arsenal's global fanbase at 27 million, the third-largest in the world. The club's north London location, adjoining socially wealthy areas such as Canonbury and Barnsbury, mixed areas such as Islington, Holloway, Highbury, and the adjacent London Borough of Camden, and largely working-class areas such as Finsbury Park and Stoke Newington, as well as neighbouring Homerton, Clapton and Dalston, has meant that Arsenal's supporters have typically come from across the usual class divides. Much of the Afro-Caribbean support comes from the neighbouring London Borough of Hackney and a large portion of the South Asian Arsenal supporters travel to the stadium from Wembley and Harrow, in the north west of the capital. The NW London areas of Edgware, Hendon and Barnet are home to many of the club's Jewish supporters, who are also among the many Arsenal fans from adjacent Hertfordshire towns such as Borehamwood. Songs In addition to the usual English football chants, Arsenal's supporters sing \\"One-Nil to the Arsenal\\" (to the tune of \\"Go West\\") and also regularly sing \\"Who's that team they call the Arsenal\\", \\"Good Old Arsenal\\" (to the tune of \\"Rule, Britannia!\\") and \\"We're the North Bank/Clock End Highbury\\". The fans also chant \\"Boring, Boring Arsenal\\" in self-deprecating reference to Arsenal's reputation during the 1970s and 1980s as an overly defensive, cautious team. Rivalries Arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is with their nearest major neighbours, Tottenham Hotspur, with matches between the two being referred to as North London derbies. Matches against Chelsea F.C., of west London, are also considered major derby matches. In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United have had a strong on-pitch rivalry since the late 1980s, which intensified in the 1990s as both clubs began often competing for the Premier League title. A 2003 online survey found that Arsenal supporters most dislike Tottenham, followed by Manchester United and Chelsea, although both Chelsea and Spurs fans see Arsenal as their main rival. Traditions =St. Totteringham's Day= Saint Totteringham's Day is a concept created in 2002 and first published on the fan website arseweb.com. It is supposedly marked as being the day when Arsenal have gathered sufficient points to be mathematically assured to finish ahead of Tottenham in the league table. In 2007, the concept was first mentioned (mistakenly as 'St. Totteridge') in an Arsenal official match programme although there are suggestions that it has existed since 2005. St. Totteringham's day 2010 was the first time the celebration was acknowledged by mainstream media, with mentions from the BBC, and The Guardian newspapers. The unofficial 'holiday' has not occurred since 2017, when Spurs' 2‚Äì0 win over Arsenal on 30 April ensured that Tottenham would finish above Arsenal in the league for the first time in 22 years. =Yellow Ribbon Symbolism= Wearing a yellow ribbon, or symbolism pertaining to yellow ribbons or the colour yellow is a tradition often associated with Arsenal playing at Wembley Stadium (or other cup finals). It is thought to have originated in the 1950s and 70s, when Arsenal had considerable successes reaching the FA Cup Final. As a nod to Arsenal's iconic yellow kit used, fans sang a rendition of \\"Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon\\" as a chant. Originally, a US war poem, first published in 1917, it was popularised in 1949 by the film, 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon' starring John Wayne, where the Andrews Sisters performed the song. Since then, it has been established into fan folklore. https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/yellow-ribbon-arsenal-cup- finals-12927087 Police and community relations Arsenal supporters enjoy good relations with police forces around the country and especially the Metropolitan Police.

The original Louisville and Nashville Railroad offices in Louisville were at Second and Main in Louisville, by the entrance of present-day George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge. By 1890, it had become obvious that the building was too overcrowded. It was decided that the office building should be located next to Louisville's Union Station. Construction began in 1902, but its completion was delayed until January 1907, due to difficulties with organized labor in a 1905 steel workers strike. Its total cost was $650,000. It was large enough that after decades of separation, all of the main administrative staff could be in the same building. In the 1970s, about 2,000 L&N; employees worked in the building. After L&N; was purchased by CSX nearly all of the jobs were moved from Louisville to Jacksonville, Florida, in 1980. However, a 6-person CSX claims department stayed in the building until 1988. In 1984, the state of Kentucky spent $15 million to purchase and renovate the property, retaining the L&N; name and neon lights on its upper stories. The building is currently the Louisville offices for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services. In August 2009, the building was closed due to the 2009 Kentuckiana Flood, but would reopen as soon as deemed safe.

For a law to pass it must be approved in three independent readings. Land transfer referendums The law was enacted in the context of peace talks with Syria, which wants Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights based on the \\"land for peace\\" formula. The Golan Heights were occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six- Day War, and were unilaterally annexed in 1981. Because many Israelis oppose a retreat from the Golan Heights, several Knesset members wanted to ensure that any proposal to withdraw from the area would be \\"approved by the people, without outside considerations, tricks or political bribes\\", hence the adoption of the referendum law. Israel already has another law which mandates a referendum before ceding any territory under Israeli sovereignty, but that law also states that it would not apply until a Basic Law detailing the procedures for holding a referendum is passed. Originally, the Knesset enacted a law which eliminates the need to enact a Basic Law, but following a High Court of Justice ruling, that law, which requires that territorial concessions be approved by a national referendum or general elections or a majority of 80 Knesset members, was itself formally readopted as a Basic Law. The holding of a referendum has been proposed several times over the course of Israel's history, although none of these proposals has ever succeeded. David Ben-Gurion proposed a referendum on the introduction of a majoritarian electoral system in 1958 to reduce the influence of the National Religious Party. Menachem Begin proposed the introduction of a legislative initiative, which would have allowed 100,000 citizens to demand that a proposed law be submitted to a referendum. The referendum was also briefly discussed in the 1970s, when a plebiscite over the future of the West Bank was considered. =21st century= More recently, a referendum was proposed in 2005 when then Prime minister Ariel Sharon proposed Israel's unilateral disengagement plan from the Gaza Strip. Israeli settlers in the Gaza Strip who were opposed to the abandonment of their settlements there had asked that a national referendum be held on the plan. Sharon opposed the holding of a referendum, and the law was instead passed through the Knesset. Israel's withdrawal from its Sinai settlements in the 1980s (part of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty) was also never put to a referendum. On 28 July 2013, a majority of 13 out of 22 members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet approved a bill stating that any peace treaty with the Palestinian Authority which includes withdrawals from territory will be put before an Israeli referendum before enactment.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 141 Different in many ways from their peers in the nascent punk subculture, they were known for eschewing the more political stances that were fashionable at the time, instead producing works of a cartoonish and absurdist nature. They were often compared to The Rezillos because of their Gerry Anderson-themed work. History The band was formed by Seymour Bybuss (Ben Browton, vocals) and Brian Helicopter (Gareth Holder, bass guitar), who recruited Nigel Greenway (guitar), Nick Hadley (guitar), and Charlie Pullen (drums).Ogg, Alex (2006) No More Heroes: a Complete History of UK Punk 1976-1980, Cherry Red Books, , p. 518-520 This line-up played their debut gig at Coventry's University of Warwick supporting The Killjoys, and recorded a demo shortly after. They were offered a deal by EMI, but the record company wanted them to change their name to The Racket and mime to a pre-recorded song; This prompted Hadley to leave the band, and they carried on as The Shapes, with EMI bringing them together with songwriter Nick Brind of Joe Public, but this relationship broke down after Brind insisted on singing on the resulting tracks. Pullen was replaced by Dave Gee and the band returned to live performances and recorded more material before Greenway left the band. The remaining trio put an advert in the NME for new members, recruiting Steve Richards (lead guitar) as a result, and adding Gee's friend Tim Jee on guitar around the same time. Feeling that dealing with major record companies was a waste of time, they decided that they would record and release their material under their own independent label, Sofa Records, in order to retain control of their output. The new line-up recorded four tracks at Woodbine Studios which were released as their vinyl debut in March 1979 as the EP Part of the Furniture on their own Sofa label. The d√©but EP was given airplay by John Peel, who invited the band to record a session for his BBC Radio 1 show the following month.\\"03/04/1979 - The Shapes\\", Keeping It Peel, BBC, retrieved 2010-10-03 The EP sold sufficiently for the band to repress it twice, with total sales of 10,000 copies. A track off the EP was licensed to the Labels Unlimited compilation released by Cherry Red Records in 1979 also. The band's humorous take on punk rock received comparisons to The Rezillos. They played support slots with The Fall, The Cure, and The Reaction, and were picked up by Terri Hooley's Good Vibrations label for the next single, \\"Blast Off\\". Hooley got the band on the bill of a concert by The Saints at the Royal Ulster Hall in Belfast, the band now without Richards. On their return to England they supported The Photos on tour, and recorded an EP for Good Vibrations (featuring \\"Jennifer the Conifer\\", \\"Let's Go (To Planet Skaro)\\", and \\"My House is a Satellite\\") but it was never released. The band split up in the early 1980s, with Holder already splitting his time between The Shapes and another band. Tim Jee went on to join The Captain Black Solution, while Bybuss made several appearances on Eurotrash as transvestite nun 'Sister Bendy' and started a new band, The Ambassadors of Plush. Holder remained in the music business, playing and recording with Rogue Male and Hells Belles before moving to California to work as a professional skydiver. Richards went on to be a horse breeder, while Gee ran a recruitment agency in Northampton. Original guitarist Nigel Greenway left the music business and committed suicide some years later. Charlie Pullen is performing and has been drumming in rock covers band 'V8' since 1989. Having achieved cult status, their records commanded high prices among collectors. This demand resulted in a belated release of a full length retrospective of all of the singles, B-Sides, radio sessions and demos as the collection Songs for Sensible People on Overground Records in 1998. The independent label Hyped to Death have released Shapes tracks as part of their compilation series from 2002 onwards in the USA. The most recent release being in 2007 on their Messthetics series of releases. Overground Records re-released Songs for Sensible People in its original format in January 2008. In mid-2008, it was announced that The Shapes would reform in their original line-up for a tour of the United Kingdom to mark the 30 year anniversary of their first single in December 2008 supporting The Damned, UK Subs, Penetration, Radio Stars and Johnny Moped, amongst others. In 2013, the Spanish independent label, Paramecium Records, approached the band with plans to re-release both the Part of the Furniture EP, and the second double A Side single Blastoff/Airline Disaster, in their original 7-inch vinyl format with original artwork, for a limited edition run of 500 records each. These releases, PAR-090 and PAR-010 respectively, proved popular enough for Overground Records to release a full length 12-inch vinyl LP of remastered tracks in 2014, called More Songs for Sensible People, (OVER81LP). This renewed interest prompted the band to once again reform in the original line- up of Bybuss/Helicopter/Jee/Richards/Gee to embark upon the \\"You'll Do Yourself a Mischief\\" tour in the UK in June 2014. Out of this tour was born 'A Film For Sensible People' filmed and edited by Phil Coupland of Ikonograph, and is a 20-minute documentary featuring interviews with the band and live songs recorded in Brighton in 2014. In April 2016, the original line-up again toured the UK as the \\"We're Not Very Famous\\" tour. During this tour, they recorded their first new single since 1980, the double A side \\"Don't Play Tennis\\" and \\"We're Not Very Famous\\". They released this on their own Sofa Records label. (SEAT 004). In March 2017, The Shapes toured Japan for the first time.

Rope start (also called pull start or rewind start) is a method of starting an internal combustion engine, usually on small machines, such as lawn mowers, chainsaws, ultralight aircraft, small outboard motors and portable engine-generators. Also used on some small vehicles such as small go- karts, minibikes, and small ATVs. Recoil start This starter mechanism comprises a rope, with a grip at the end, moulded rope reels and a spring. The rope is coiled within a reel which is held under spring tension within an outer reel. This reel assembly is in contact with one end of the crankshaft through a ratcheting mechanism (specifically, a freewheel clutch). When the rope's grip is pulled, the rope uncoils, tensions the spring, engages the clutch and turns the crankshaft, spinning it to crank or start the engine before the end of the pull stroke. After the end of the pull is reached, the spring operated reel retracts the rope, either to store it, or to prepare it for another attempt to start and disengages the clutch hence the term \\"re-coil starter\\". If the reel were directly connected to the crank and lacked the freewheel mechanism, once the rope reached its end, the spinning crankshaft would keep turning the reel, which would violently recoil the rope in the opposite direction until it reached its end, where it would likely jam and stall the engine. This was created by Jacobsen Manufacturing in 1928. Old- style rope start A reel connected to the crankshaft has a notch in it to put a rope through. The rope is wound around the reel and pulled, starting the engine, but once the end of the pull is reached, it comes free, leaving a loose rope in the person's hand. If the engine fails to start on the first pull, the operator has to re-wind it by hand. Easy start features A number of features are labelled by manufacturers as \\"easy start,\\" such as the presence of a primer bulb, an additional elastic/spring element between the starter rope and the crankshaft, a decompression release, or simply an engine which the manufacturer contends is easy to start. A compression release feature, found on many modern engines and especially larger 2-strokes, is a valve in the combustion chamber which can be held open while the rope is being pulled, avoiding the need to overcome compression while imparting enough angular momentum for the engine to continue. Once the engine fires on its own and creates a sufficient over-pressure, the mechanism is deactivated so the engine can develop enough compression to run normally. Compression release valves may, depending on the design, either be manually opened by the operator or be automatically opened when the choke is engaged or whenever the engine is not running.

The party originated as a splinter group within the Jammu & Kashmir National Conference.  History  In 1932 Pro-Congress Sheikh Abdullah formed Kashmir's first political party, the All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, with a demand for merger of Jammu and Kashmir with British India. His party was renamed the National Conference in 1939 to suite the secular nature of Kashmiri culture. The All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, led by Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah, espoused a secular ideology and wished to create a secular, democratic but independent Kashmir with close ties to British India. When the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference was converted into a secular political party in 1939, the Muslim leaders amended the Constitution of the Muslim Conference, renamed it as the All Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, modified its objectives and threw its membership open to all the people of the State. On 13 June 1941, the breakaway factions of the National Conference revived the erstwhile Muslim Conference under the leadership of Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas. On July 19, 1947, a convention of All Jammu & Kashmir Muslim Conference, adopted the \\"Accession to Pakistan Resolution\\" demanding accession of the Kashmir state to Pakistan. This was included into the 1974 Constitution of Azad Kashmir.

It came after the breakup of the Allman Brothers Band in 1976. During this time, Allman had moved to Hollywood to live with his then-wife Cher. The album was produced by Lenny Waronker, and in his memoir, My Cross to Bear, Allman remembered that Waronker was frustrated with his unpunctuality in regards to studio time. The album was released in May 1977, on Capricorn Records. Allman claimed that Phil Walden, owner of Capricorn, was incensed over his move to the West Coast to live with Cher, and only printed 50,000 copies of the LP.

Career  Bergstrom's writing career started in advertising and newspaper reporting, including as a freelance writer for The Milwaukee Journal. She taught some writing classes at Milwaukee Area Technical College. While working as a copywriter in the early 1980s, she returned to creative writing; her first published piece of fiction was her first novel, Shattered Glass, the first in a series of vampire novels. Published in 1989, the novel introduced the character of the immortal Stephen Austra and artist Helen Wells, a victim of polio, along with Steffen's family of hereditary vampires. Its setting is Cleveland and nearby suburbs, in the 1950s.Strassmeyer, Mary (July 5, 1989). \\"Shattered Glass\\", The Plain Dealer. The novel was a critical success, and since then, Bergstrom has written five other novels in the series, including Daughter of the Night, which featured Elizabeth Bathory as a half-breed Austra vampire. Using her grandmother's name, Marie Kiraly, Bergstrom wrote a sequel to Dracula called Mina ... The Dracula Story Continues and its sequel, Blood to Blood ... The Dracula Story Continues, which both look at Mina Harker as a woman changed by her experience in Transylvania, struggling to find her way in the repressive Victorian society. Both were featured in the Science Fiction Book Club (the former for more than a decade) and Doubleday Book Club. For Glass and its sequel Blood Rites, she visited a number of major art glass producers. For the novel Madeline ... After the Fall of Usher, she adopted Poe's journalistic style to tell a story in which the details of the last few months of Poe's life are correct, with her own fictional story overlaid on them. Bergstrom wrote novels for the Ravenloft setting, including Tapestry of Dark Souls (1993) and Baroness of Blood (1995). Tapestry of Dark Souls introduced the first lesbian couple in a D&D;/TSR world; Bergstrom has a significant gay following. She also works as a television critic and feature writer. Her interviews have included the novelist David Morrell and director Wes Craven.

He has also adapted the Percy Jackson & The Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus book series by Rick Riordan into graphic novels. Early life Robert Venditti was born in Memorial Hospital and raised in Hollywood, and Pembroke Pines, Florida. Though he says he always wanted to be a prose writer, he rarely read comics as a child, but would peruse the comics at the barber shop.Piccione, Sebastian (November 24, 2008). \\"Robert Venditti: Writer/Creator of The Surrogates\\". Fanboy Buzz. He later moved to Gainesville to attend the University of Florida where he received a B.A. in Political Science and English. After college he worked as a clerk at a law firm in southern Florida with aspirations to practice law, but found that work not to his liking. After subsequently worked pumping gas on a fuel truck, he moved to the Port St. John/Titusville area in Brevard County to which his parents had moved, where he attended the University of Central Florida, working at a Borders Books store in Winter Park, while earning his M.A. in Creative Writing. In about 2000, while working at Borders, a coworker recommended comics books as reading material to him. Though the skeptical Venditti initially thought of comics as solely for children, his reading of Kurt Busiek's Astro City impressed him enough to decide to change his career aspirations from prose to comics. Career In 2002 Venditti attended a convention and met Chris Staros from Top Shelf Productions, and was added to Staros' email list. That April, Staros subsequently sent out a mass email announcing that Top Shelf's distributor was going bankrupt, and asking recipients of the email to place orders to aid the distributor. Venditti contacted Staros to offer help, and ending up doing warehouse work for him. Venditti began working on The Surrogates in July 2002, and after finishing the script that December, he gave it to Staros, who decided to publish it through Top Shelf, despite the fact that it was not typical of the material they usually published. The first issue of the five-issue miniseries was published in July 2005, and the fifth in March 2006.

Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that Ohio's filing deadline for independent candidates was unconstitutional.  Background  John B. Anderson was a declared candidate for the 1980 presidential election. On May 16, 1980, Anderson's supporters filed a nominating petition to the Ohio Secretary of State's office. Then-secretary Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. rejected the petition, because it was not filed by the state's deadline of seventy-five days prior to the presidential primary. At that time, the primary election was held on the Tuesday following the first Monday in June. In 1980, the deadline would have been March 20. The federal district court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional on two grounds. First, the statute violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by placing too high of a burden to petition the government. Second, the deadline was earlier than that required by candidates in the major parties, thereby violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This decision was later reversed by the United States Court of Appeals, but the United States Supreme Court overturned that decision.  Opinion of the Court  = Majority opinion = The United States Supreme Court overturned the appellate court's ruling and reinstated that of the district court. Among other points, the majority stated: > An early filing deadline may have a substantial impact on independent-minded > voters. In election campaigns, particularly those which are national in > scope, the candidates and the issues simply do not remain static over time. > Various candidates rise and fall in popularity; domestic and international > developments bring new issues to center stage and may affect voters' > assessments of national problems. Such developments will certainly affect > the strategies of candidates who have already entered the race; they may > also create opportunities for new candidates. See A. Bickel, Reform and > Continuity 87-89 (1971). Yet Ohio's filing deadline prevents persons who > wish to be independent candidates from entering the significant political > arena established in the State by a Presidential election campaign - and > creating new political coalitions of Ohio voters - at any time after mid-to- > late March. 11 At this point developments in campaigns for the major-party > nominations have only begun, and the major parties will not adopt their > nominees and platforms for another five months. Candidates and supporters > within the major parties thus have the political advantage of continued > flexibility; for independents, the inflexibility imposed by the March filing > deadline is a correlative disadvantage because of the competitive nature of > the electoral process. \\\\--John Paul Stevens = Dissenting opinion = The dissenting opinion of the court pointed to Ohio's deadline for partisan candidates, which was the same as that of independent candidates: > Should a candidate decide to seek the nomination of a political party > participating in Ohio's primary election by capturing delegate votes for the > party's national convention, the candidate must file a declaration of > candidacy and a nominating petition bearing signatures from 1,000 members of > the party; the filing must occur no later than the 75th day before the first > Tuesday after the first Monday in June of the election year... If a > candidate chooses to run as a nonparty candidate, he must file, by the same > date as a party candidate participating in the primary, a statement of > candidacy and a nominating petition bearing the signatures of 5,000 > qualified voters. \\\\--William H. Rehnquist The dissent additionally stated that states had discretion in allowing or refusing to allow national candidates on their ballots. In light of a sensible system of petitioning, the Supreme Court should not interfere: > Today the Court holds that the filing deadline for nonparty candidates in > this statutory scheme violated the First Amendment rights of 1980 > Presidential hopeful John Anderson and Anderson's supporters. Certainly, > absent a court injunction ordering that his name be placed on the ballot, > Anderson and his supporters would have been injured by Ohio's ballot access > requirements; by failing to comply with the filing deadline for nonparty > candidates Anderson would have been excluded from Ohio's 1980 general > election ballot. But the Constitution does not require that a State allow > any particular Presidential candidate to be on its ballot, and so long as > the Ohio ballot access laws are rational and allow nonparty candidates > reasonable access to the general election ballot, this Court should not > interfere with Ohio's exercise of its Art.

Its mission is to 'make 90 the new 50 by 2030' by supporting tissue engineering and regenerative medicine therapies. Their work includes: incubating and investing in early-stage life science companies, funding scientific research, providing fiscal sponsorship to aligned projects, and sponsoring inducement prizes. The charity was named after Methuselah, the grandfather of Noah in the Hebrew Bible, whose lifespan was recorded as 969 years. In 2000, the foundation was originally conceived by David Gobel as the Longitude Prize Society, named after the British government's Longitude Act, which set up monetary rewards for anyone who could devise a portable, practical solution for determining a ship's longitude. In 2003, the organization was made public as the Methuselah Foundation at the 32nd Annual Meeting of the American Aging Association, where they awarded the first Methuselah Mouse Prize to Andrej Bartke for his work on mice that lived the equivalent of 180 human years.  Current projects  = Methuselah Fund = The Methuselah Fund was created as an LLC subsidiary of the Methuselah Foundation to incubate and invest in early-stage companies. Investments to date have included: Organovo (NYSE: ONVO), a leader in 3D bioprinting; Silverstone Solutions (acquired by BiologicTx in 2013), a maker of kidney- matching software that enables hospitals and transplant organizations to more quickly and accurately pair patients with compatible donors; Oisin Biotechnologies, a company aiming to remove senescent cells, commonly seen as a hallmark of aging; and Leucadia Therapeutics, a company working to address Alzheimer's disease by restoring the flow of cerebrospinal fluid across the cribriform plate. = New Organ Alliance = The Methuselah Foundation fiscally sponsors the New Organ Alliance, an initiative working to raise awareness and facilitate research to help alleviate organ donation shortages. In 2013, the foundation announced the New Organ Liver Prize, a $1,000,000 award to the first team that can create a bioengineered or regenerative liver therapy for a \\"large mammal, enabling the host to recover in the absence of native liver function and survive three months with a normal lifestyle.\\" In partnership with the Organ Preservation Alliance, New Organ facilitated a technology roadmap report\\"Solving Organ Shortage through Organ Banking and Bioengineering.\\" New Organ Alliance. 2018.

The prize for longevity was first won by a research team led by Andrzej Bartke of Southern Illinois University. The prize for rejuvenation first went to Stephen Spindler of the University of California, Riverside. Additionally, in 2009, the first Mprize Lifespan Achievement Award went to Z. Dave Sharp of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio for extending the lifespan of already aged mice using the pharmaceutical rapamycin. On May 30, 2014, at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the American Aging Association, Methuselah Foundation awarded a $10,000 Mprize to Huber Warner for his founding of the National Institute on Aging's Interventions Testing Program. = 3D bioprinter grants = In 2013, Methuselah Foundation began a partnership with Organovo to fund the use of their 3D bioprinters at academic research centers for biomedical research. Under the grant program, the foundation committed \\"at least $500,000 in direct funding for research projects across several institutions.\\" Recipients to date include: Yale School of Medicine (John P. Geibel), UCSF School of Medicine (Edward Hsiao), and the Murdoch Children's Research Institute (Melissa Little).  Past projects  = Bowhead Whale Genome = In 2015, with funding from the Methuselah Foundation and Life Extension Foundation, the bowhead whale genome was sequenced by Jo√£o Pedro de Magalh√£es and his team at the University of Liverpool. The bowhead whale is possibly the longest-lived mammal, capable of living over 200 years. The genome project was undertaken to learn more about the mammal's mechanisms for longevity and resistance to age-related diseases, which are unknown. An assembly of the bowhead whale genome has been made available online to promote further research. = Organ Preservation Alliance = In 2013, Methuselah began fiscally sponsoring and collaborating with the Organ Preservation Alliance (OPA), an initiative coordinating research and stakeholders for the preservation of tissues and organs. OPA's activities have included: hosting Organ Banking Summits, developing a technology roadmap for organ banking, creating the first Organ and Tissue Preservation Community of Practice with the American Society of Transplantation, organizing an \\"Organs on Demand\\" workshop at the U.S. Military Academy,\\"Organs On-Demand.\\" Organ Preservation Alliance. 2018.

SRF was formed to study why supercentenarians, people over 110 years of age, live longer than most, and why they die. Eight autopsies of supercentenarians were conducted by SRF, with six indicating senile cardiac transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis at the time of death. TTR amyloidosis \\"amasses in and clogs blood vessels, forcing the heart to work harder and eventually fail.\\" = SENS Research Foundation = From 2003‚Äì2009, Methuselah Foundation served as the backbone organization for the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS) program, a long-term research framework developed by Aubrey de Grey. The SENS program aims to prevent or reverse seven forms of molecular or cellular damage associated with aging. During that time, de Grey and David Gobel established SENS-related research programs on human bioremedial biology ‚Äì \\"getting the crud out\\" in Methuselah's parlance ‚Äì at Rice University and Arizona State University. The programs were the first use of environmental remediation principles directed at reversing \\"pollution\\" in human cells. Additionally, Methuselah sponsored a series of SENS-focused roundtables and conferences, and funded the writing of Ending Aging, co- authored by de Grey and Michael Rae. Under de Grey's continued leadership, SENS spun out from Methuselah as the SENS Research Foundation in 2009.  Donors  In 2004, Methuselah Foundation began a donor initiative called the Methuselah 300 (\\"The 300\\"), a community of philanthropic donors pledging $25,000 over 25 years, at a minimum of $1,000 annually, toward the organization. The initiative was named after the 300 Spartans who held the pass at Thermopylae in 480 BC during the Greco-Persian Wars. In addition, in 2015, the foundation began memorializing The 300 donors with a monument at St. Thomas Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. On September 16, 2006, Peter Thiel announced a pledge of $3.5 million to the Methuselah Foundation and the SENS program to \\"support scientific research into the alleviation and eventual reversal of the debilities caused by aging.\\" In January 2018, the anonymous principal of the Pineapple Fund donated $1 million to the Methuselah Foundation. On February 2, 2018, Vitalik Buterin donated $2.4 million to the Foundation.

Rosehill has a continuing agenda of refurbishment of facilities, with a focus on the creation of vibrant indoor and outdoor learning spaces. The outdoor areas consist of outdoor learning environments, passive recreational areas and updated sporting facilities. The school is a single campus with students from Years 7 to 12. The enrolment in 2014 is 1140 with growth at all levels. Girls and boys are about equal in number. Rosehill SC has International Student accreditation. The college has a balance of experienced and younger staff with three Assistant Principals, each with a discrete area of responsibility. The College runs four, 75 minute periods per day and the school is divided into a Junior School (Years 7‚Äì9) and a Senior School (Years 10‚Äì12). In 2014, the Junior School has 650 students and the Senior School 490. All students in Years 7‚Äì9 study Maths, Science and English and choose six elective subjects from Languages (Japanese or Italian), The Arts, Physical Education and Health, Humanities and Technology; also, Literacy and Numeracy Enhancement studies. All Year 10 students study English and Maths (differentiated groupings), and eight electives from the KLAs and VCE subjects; also, an interdisciplinary unit on health, drug education, driver education, and Pathways into VCE and beyond. Students in Years 11 and 12 select a VCE or VCAL pathway. 2014 is a Year of Review and a new Strategic Plan will be in place from the commencement of the 2015 school year. VCAL is offered within the Senior School, and the college is committed to offering careers and further education pathways to all its students. The College employs consultants and coaches in the areas of Literacy and Numeracy and has worked closely with a network of schools in the development of Science Curriculum as well as the more effective use of digital technologies as an instructional and learning tool. A Selective Talent Enrichment Program (S.T.E.P.) is offered from Years 7 to 10, and senior students may participate in The University of Melbourne Mathematics Extension Program.  Controversy  In March 2017, the school came under fire from parents for issuing an assignment to year 10 students that had requested for them to design and market an illicit designer drug through creating a packaging that would appeal to drug users. The father of a student attending the school had contacted radio presenter Neil Mitchell on 3AW in order to express his outrage at the coursework, raising concerns that the task aimed to promote substance abuse and would pique curiosity about drug use among youth. Shortly afterwards, school principal Peter Rouse was contacted by 3AW for comment, who expressed \\"mixed feelings\\" towards the assignment, going on to state that the work was \\"open to a bit of misinterpretation.\\" He said that the assignment had been a part of the school's interdisciplinary studies for four years until that point, included for students to conduct and present research about the dangers of drug use. Rouse stated that the task would be removed from the course, and asserted that \\"we [Rosehill Secondary College] have a very strong anti-drug policy.\\"  Notable alumni  * Shane Jacobson, Australian actor, director, writer and comedian who is most notable for starring in the Australian comedy film Kenny. * Jake Bilardi, 18-year-old suicide bomber who pledged allegiance towards ISIL in 2015, before dying in an unsuccessful suicide bombing attack.

The wooden trim and shingles at the front of the church are inspired by the Queen Anne style. A bell tower, which was removed in 1914, originally topped the church. The St. Anne's congregation was formed in 1883, three years before its church was constructed; prior to then, Episcopal services had been held in other denominations' churches and the town's Temperance Hall. Contractor James Dickenson constructed the church at a cost of $600 in 1886, the same year the congregation was formally recognized by the Bishop of Springfield. The church underwent renovations in the 1950s and 1960s to expand and modernize the building. In 1977, the congregation folded; the church's bell was moved to Trinity Episcopal Church in Jacksonville, Illinois five years later.

Related activities such as running a brothel and pimping are prohibited by the Criminal Code, although there are known to be brothels in the capital, Yerevan, and in Gyumri. According to UNESCO, since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, prostitution in the country has grown. There are about 5,600 women involved in prostitution in Armenia,roughly 1,500 of them are in Yerevan. However, official police figures are far lower, for example 240 in 2012. Police and other safety forces reportedly tolerate prostitution. Many women turn to prostitution due to unemployment. Child prostitution is a problem in the country, but this is denied by the authorities. Sex trafficking is also a problem. History At the start of the 20th century, prostitution in Armenia was legal and regulated. The main objective of the regulation was to control sexually transmitted infections. Brothels could be opened by women over 35 years old. The brothel could not be within 150 sazhens (320 metres) of churches, schools, and other public places. The owner must live on the premises and not engage in prostitution herself. She could take a maximum of 3/4 of the prostitutes' earnings. A former brothel in Teryan Street, Yerevan is still noticeable by its carved naked women on the facade. During majority of the soviet period, prostitution officially didn't exist. Prostitutes were sent to be \\"re-educated\\" in labour camps. It wasn't until 1987, that the Administrative Code included the prohibition of prostitution. Calls for legalisation The head of Dermatology and Infectious Diseases Scientific- Medical Center, doctor-dermatologist Samvel Hovhannisyan, was quoted as saying in June 2015: \\"The legalisation of prostitution in Armenia may cause a reduction of a rate of sexually transmitted diseases to 60%.\\" He added that the \\"ancient profession\\" must be strictly controlled by the country. In 2016, the Helsinki Citizens‚Äô Assembly‚Äôs Vanadzor Office president, Artur Sakunts, called for prostitution to be legalised and regulated. He said the taxes paid by the sex workers would benefit the country, and that ‚ÄúPaid sex services should not be considered a punishable act; they should not be prosecuted not to be ever manageable at the hands of organized criminal groups which could make [sex workers] victims of internal trafficking.‚Äù In the run-up to the 2017 Armenian parliamentary election, former prime minister, Hrant Bagratyan, of the Free Democrats party said prostitution should be legalised and licensed, and taxation of their services would be positive towards the state's budget. Sex Trafficking Human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Armenia, and traffickers exploit victims from Armenia abroad. Armenian women and children are subjected to sex trafficking in the UAE and Turkey. Armenian women and children are also subjected to sex trafficking within the country. Russian women working as dancers in nightclubs are vulnerable to sex trafficking.

HAPs may offer the potential, alone and in combination with conventional chemotherapy, of improving cancer therapy. It is believed that tumor hypoxia contributes significantly to treatment failure and relapse among cancer patients because cells in the hypoxic zones of solid tumors resist traditional chemotherapy for at least two reasons: first, most antitumor agents cannot penetrate beyond 50-100 micrometers from capillaries, thereby never reaching those cells in the hypoxic regions. Secondly, the lower nutrient and oxygen supply to cells in the hypoxic zones of tumors cause them to divide more slowly than their well oxygenated counterparts, so hypoxic tumor cells exhibit greater resistance to chemotherapies and radiation which target rapidly dividing cells or require oxygen for efficacy. Hypoxia also contributes to the invasive and metastatic phenotypes of aggressive cancers by promoting genetic instability and accelerating the accumulation of mutations that can ultimately give rise to drug resistance. There are several companies developing HAPs: Novacea, Inc. (acquired by Transcept/Paratek pharmaceuticals), Proacta Inc. (now defunct) and Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

In the early 1960s, the Army decided that gun-based systems were outdated, and canceled further development in favor of the MIM-46 Mauler missile system that also failed to enter service. The designer, the Sperry Utah Engineering Laboratory, later revived the Vigilante, rechambering it for NATO-standard 35√ó228mm rounds and mounting it on a M48 tank chassis for the DIVADs contest. However, it ultimately lost to Ford's M247 Sergeant York that also failed to enter service. Development Very little information exists of the T249 Vigilante and its T250 cannon. The conceptual design for the T250 cannon was initiated in 1956. While the design of cannon of this caliber would ordinarily be handled by Watervliet Arsenal, it was decided that Springfield Armory would take responsibility due to their previous development experience with smaller caliber rotary cannon such the 20mm T171. The T250 was the largest Gatling gun ever assembled. Its 37√ó219mmSR round was based upon a shortened and necked-down 40√ó311mmR Bofors cartridge case. Hydraulically powered, the gun was able to vary between 120 rpm for (especially stationary) ground targets and 3,000 rpm for air targets. It had a 192-round drum magazine, which in the 3,000 rpm mode would have equated to approximately 5 seconds of fire. When Springfield engineers finished their work in 1962, the design was handed over to Watervliet for production. The Sperry Utah Engineering Laboratory was selected to handle the integration of the T250 gun with the modified M113 chassis to create the T249.

The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons () is a work in oils by the French artist Jacques-Louis David. On a canvas of 146 square feet, this painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1789. The subject is the Roman leader Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic, contemplating the fate of his sons. They had conspired to overthrow the republic and restore the monarchy, and Brutus himself was compelled to order their deaths. In doing so, Brutus became the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. The painting was a bold allegory of civic virtue with immense resonance for the growing cause of republicanism. Its themes of virtue, sacrifice, and devotion to the nation sparked much controversy when it was unveiled in the politically charged era of the French Revolution. Background David labored over the painting for more than two years before he considered it complete. His attachment to the motif of Brutus had been evident for years before this painting, at least since the early 1780s when he was making The Oath of the Horatii (1784). This earlier work bears a distinct connection to Brutus through the themes of duty, loyalty, and virtue. The oath itself was an element of the Brutus legend which David artistically transposed to the Horatii. Similar license was taken with the composition of Brutus: the return of the sons' bodies is an episode not found in the accounts of Livy and Plutarch. David's enthusiasm for the republican cause, at least at this early stage, is a matter of dispute. Many historians believe his painterly inspirations were more prosaic, drawn from standard classical history lessons and lesser events of contemporary notoriety. In spite of its quick apotheosis by the public, some contemporaries questioned the personal intentions of David regarding this work, and the debate remains unresolved. Composition Like most of David's works, Brutus is on a large canvas. It measures in height and in width. The style of painting is in the Neoclassical manner. Brutus sits on a klismos on the left, alone and brooding; to the right, his wife holds their two horrified daughters, the elder of which is about to faint, while a servant on the far right quakes in anguish. Note Brutus' tense crossed feet in the picture, the sharp scissors that lay dead in the center of the painting, and the use of light and dark to draw a distinction between Brutus and his wife. Brutus does not even look back as his headless sons Tiberius and Titus are brought into the room. Schama, Simon. BBC documentary series: The Power of Art. Presentation The name is frequently rendered in English as Brutus Receiving the Bodies of His Sons, among other variations, including Brutus and His Dead Sons and simply Brutus. The complete original name as presented to the Salon was much lengthier and more explicative. It too has been rendered in various forms, but as translated from the small Salon guidebook (livret) offered in 1789, it reads, with poignancy in the first year of the Revolution, as: Brutus, first consul, returned to his house after having condemned his two sons who had allied themselves with the Tarquins and conspired against Roman liberty; the lictors return their bodies so that they may be entombed. Impact The work had tremendous resonance for the time. The Revolution had already begun, and all paintings shown at the Salon had to be approved for political acceptability. David's 1788 portrait of Antoine Lavoisier had already been refused a display because the famed chemist was a potentially divisive figure, tied as he was to the Ancien R√©gime. Out of similar caution, The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons was almost not shown because of concerns about inflaming pro-revolutionary passions. The public's insistence was too great, however, and the authorities were forced to give in. After its first exhibition, David's friend, the actor Fran√ßois-Joseph Talma, played the title role in Voltaire's Brutus and added in a scene in which the stage direction exactly replicated the composition of the already famous painting. Contemporaneously with David, the painter Angelica Kauffmann (1741‚Äì1807) was commissioned by Polish royalty to create a work she entitled Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death for Treason. This painting, now lost, is known only by written description and a preparatory pen and ink drawing from 1788. Legacy The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons is on permanent display in the Louvre in Paris. A study in ink and chalk from 1787 is housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. An oil on canvas study is in the collections of Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.

It stars Najwa Nimri, Trist√°n Ulloa, Mar√≠a V√°zquez and Nuria Gonz√°lez. The plot follows the lives of three female detectives who investigate the secrets of others, but end up uncovering their own families' lies and truths they would prefer to ignore. Plot In√©s, Eva and Carmen, three women of different generations, work as private detectives for an investigation agency run by Valbuena, their male chauvinist boss. In√©s, the youngest and most ambitious of the three is assigned to work undercover as an employee in a factory to spy on the activities of its union leaders. However, her investigation brings her face to face with a difficult emotional and ethical decision. Initially, she hoped to move through the ranks by working on this case, but her plans go awry when she begins to empathize with and develop feelings for Manuel, one of the key union members she is investigating. This ethical dilemma coupled with the fear of losing her job and career turns her life into a state of turmoil. Eva has just returned to work at the detective agency after having had her second child. She is assigned to a rather mundane case of tracking down an old man's first love. Eva finds it very hard to juggle her responsibilities and is unable to find the support she needs in her husband, I√±aki. When a mysterious woman called Marta appears in I√±aki‚Äôs life, Eva starts an investigation into her spouse‚Äôs secret life, stumbling upon the possibility that her husband may not only be having an affair but leading a double life with another wife and family. She follows him from Madrid to Zaragoza where she quickly finds out that he has had a son born from a previous relationship and has now become involved in the life of the child he ignored for 10 years. Carmen, the oldest and most experienced of the three detectives, is on a routine investigation of both the business partner and the wife of Sergio, a photographer whose wife is having an affair with his business partner and close friend. Carmen sympathizes with Sergio's marital collapse, not seeming to notice the dire straits of her own marriage.

It was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991 with Imagineering as the developer and Mindscape as the publisher. The game was based on the novel of the same name and received as the successor of the first game of the Falcon (video game series). Gameplay This combat flight simulator allows players the choice of flying either the Grumman A-6 Intruder or the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II from aircraft carriers against targets in North Vietnam. Players were challenged both by the comprehensive enemy defenses and the restrictive and complex rules of engagement of the period. Realistic features include unreliable missiles and smokey engines for the Phantom (as in real life, the trail would disappear in afterburner). At lower realism settings, the F-4 has an internal cannon in addition to the missiles, in contrast to real USN F-4's that were armed only with missiles. A wide range of mission types is available, from simple bomb runs or combat air patrols to SEAD missions requiring close cooperation between the call signs involved. The player can plan each mission in detail. Based on the given number of planes in their flight, they are able to choose from various armament options for each plane. A mission editor allows for changes in waypoints and also how friendly AI is supposed to behave in each phase of the mission. There is also the option to use a default loadout and keep the waypoints unchanged. In flight, the player is allowed to switch between the planes at will, taking control over the respective airplane or leave the AI flying and just spectate. The game also comes with a fast-forward feature, e.g., to shorten the waiting time for the transit leg from the aircraft carrier and back, which is slowed to normal time progression if there is a hostile plane in visual range. The aircraft cockpits, especially the different modes and settings of radar and targeting systems, as well as flight controls are complex. The game offers different levels of realism and difficulty and a manual giving background stories quoting real life pilots of the era. Carrier landings can be left to the AI or flown manually, the latter requiring the player to maintain the aircraft in a very small envelope to safely land, increasing the difficulty of completing a mission. Plot The game is loosely based on the novel Flight of the Intruder by Stephen Coonts. The player flies several missions off one of the aircraft carriers on Yankee Station. The game does not have a real story line but instead is set in the historic conflict of the Vietnam war. In campaign mode the player progresses through the different air campaigns of the Vietnam war, with the first mission being the notorious Tonkin Gulf incident, the casus belli escalating the conflict. Reception The game was received as a successor to the first game of the Falcon series, yet it never was as successful or prominent as the latter. Computer Gaming World in 1990 stated that the player controlling wingmen distinguished the game from other flight simulators, and favorably reviewed the flight models and other realistic features. The magazine concluded that the game \\"is a tour de force in simulation programming ... for the moment, at least, Flight of the Intruder is the king of the flight simulations\\". A 1992 survey in the magazine of wargames with modern settings gave the game three and a half stars out of five, and a 1994 survey gave it three stars.

Recognized as one of Canada's leading filmmakers, he was known for developing cutting-edge technology in his documentaries, including the five-camera, five- screen film In the Labyrinth, one of the highlights of Montreal's Expo 67. The film split elements across five screens and also combined them for a mosaic of a single image. This inspired Canadian filmmaker Norman Jewison to apply similar techniques to The Thomas Crown Affair. In the Labyrinth was the earliest inspiration for the revolutionary IMAX film format. He was a two-time Canadian Film Award winner, winning in the Training and Instruction category at the 12th Canadian Film Awards for Radiation, and in the Films for Children category at the 18th Canadian Film Awards for Above the Horizon.Maria Topalovich, And the Genie Goes To...: Celebrating 50 Years of the Canadian Film Awards. Stoddart Publishing, 2000. . Death O'Connor died in 1967 while filming a coal miner at his rented house in Jeremiah, Letcher County, Kentucky, when Hobart Ison, the property owner, arrived and told O'Connor and his crew to leave, and then shot and killed O'Connor. Journalists and filmmakers had descended upon Appalachia in the late 1960s to document the living conditions during the War on Poverty. This offended many residents, who objected to stereotyping and criticism by outsiders, as well as the tendency to show only the poor side of Appalachia. O'Connor and Ison came to represent the two sides of the conflict: the outsiders who exposed wrongs in hope of righting them and the locals who believed they were only telling one side of the story. Hobart Ison was born in 1897. His family had moved to Kentucky in the late 19th century, and their wealth was tied to land. During the coal boom of the 1920s, Ison owned several local businesses including a car dealership. However, he lost everything during the Great Depression except the land he had inherited. Ison was often described as eccentric. A lifelong bachelor, he had once been engaged, but his fianc√©e called off the wedding. Ison had already built a home for them, and chose to leave it unoccupied for 30 years rather than live in it or rent it. In 1947 Ison used money from the sale of some of his land to a railroad company to build a number of rental cottages. By 1967 he was renting them out to mining families for just $10 a month. Unaware of the hostility felt for outsiders, O'Connor came to the mountains of eastern Kentucky while working on a documentary called US, which had been commissioned by the United States Department of Commerce to be shown at HemisFair '68 in San Antonio, Texas. It would depict life in the United States from early pioneering days to the present. On September 20, 1967, O'Connor's film crew visited the rental homes owned by Ison. The crew obtained permission to film three residents. Each signed a release and was paid $10.Calvin Trillin, \\"U.S. JOURNAL: JEREMIAH, KY. A STRANGER WITH A CAMERA.\\", The New Yorker, April 12, 1969, p. 178 When Ison learned of the filming, he flew into a rage. He promptly drove to the site. Witnesses said Ison approached O'Connor and his crew as they filmed a coal miner and told them to leave his property. He then pointed a pistol at them. The crew said they could not leave without their equipment. Ison then opened fire, first at the cameras and then O'Connor. O'Connor was fatally wounded and died on the spot. According to The New Yorker, O'Connor's last words were, \\"Why'd you have to do that?\\" Trial and sentencing While many locals were shocked by the senseless killing, others rallied to Ison's defense. About 100 locals attended Ison's bond hearing and offered to help pay his bond. According to a 2001 study, > Locals defended Ison not because they approved of murder and not because of > an innate, clannish suspiciousness of outsiders, but because they perceived > the prying eyes of reporters to be an assault on manners, common decency, > and the integrity of their communities. Unable to find an impartial jury in Letcher County, the trial was moved to Harlan County, where it was held in March 1968. The prosecution was led by Commonwealth's Attorney Daniel Boone Smith, who recalled that even in Harlan County it was assumed he would not push too hard for Ison's conviction, since many locals approached him to express sympathy for Ison. Boone said his task was to convince the jurors that O'Connor and his crew were respectable people who had been commissioned by the United States Government to make a film about the entire United States, and that the Kentucky shots would only be briefly featured. The defense tried to get surviving members of the crew to admit they were in Kentucky only to photograph poor people, asking if they intended to photograph more prosperous parts of the state. The defense also wanted to know how much money they had been paid from the filming. Ison's lawyer used his closing statement to speak more about the intrusiveness of reporters than his client's actions. Nevertheless, the only legal issue was Ison's sanity. A psychiatrist testifying for the defense identified Ison as a paranoid schizophrenic, but a prosecution psychiatrist contradicted this. The trial resulted in a hung jury. The jurors later said that 11 of them wanted to convict Ison, but the twelfth held out for acquittal. On March 24, 1969, a week before a second trial was to begin, Ison pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was paroled after serving one year, and died in 1978. He never expressed any remorse for O'Connor's death. Legacy In 2000, the incident was the subject of a documentary by Elizabeth Barret called Stranger with a Camera, which aired on the PBS series P.O.V.. The weapon Ison used to kill O'Connor was a 1904 .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver. It was used again in 2003 when a housekeeper killed a teenager in a dispute over a house fire. The almost antique pistol had been in a safety deposit box, until its owner had removed it in the hope of selling it to Elizabeth Barret for her documentary.

It has had several names over its history, and was also known at the Red Stone Road and the period it was a Plank Road managed as a toll road, the Brownsville Plank Road, or the Brownsville Turnpike, or locally, as the area grew into a city, Southern Avenue. Along its route, it would also travel through Westmoreland County and end at its start terminus in Brownsville, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. It was a heavily used emigrant trail during the post-Revolutionary War surge in expansion west over the Allegheny Ridge to settle the now safer, now open lands of the Northwest Territory until well into the 1850s as an westward emigrant trail. Pre- history to the 19th century The road follows the route of ancient trails and footpaths as did many Indian roads, along the highlands and connected to the road along the descent from the Cumberland Narrows mountain pass (later descended via the upland community of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania) to the ford Monongahela River below the bluffs known as Redstone Old Fort (Later became Brownsville with the \\"forks of the Ohio\\" (eventual site of Pittsburgh, a distance of . It later became the road connecting Pittsburgh with Brownsville, Pennsylvania, and from there via Nemacolin's Path to Virginia and points further east and further West to a similar crossing at present-day Wheeling, West Virginia. Brownsville was attractive as a point on the Eastern Emigrant Trails where travelers could reach river boat construction on the water levels of the Mississippi watershed--or continue across Washington County on the wagon roads westward to cross the (West) Virginia pan handle to reach lower central Ohio and points west. It was a major route for travel by stagecoach and emigrants driving Conestoga Wagons to Northern Ohio (often via Youngstown, Ohio WNW of Pittsburgh or Northwestwards for the lower side of the Great Lakes. Whatever the destination, at least one crossing of the Allegheny and Youghiogheny Rivers was needed for travelers proceeding west on northern roads.). The road was also significant during the Whiskey Rebellion, particularly its southern half; when trans-Allegheny farmers rose in armed protest to a tax on liquor sent east by pack animal on the Cumberland- Brownsville Road--shipping distilled liquor was easier than shipping the much greater volume and weight of raw grains. 19th century It was the route along which telegraph lines first entered Pittsburgh. There are relatively few roads connecting the floodplain of the Monongahela River with the higher elevations to the south and west of the river. Originally, Brownsville road connected with the floodplain by the road now known as Arlington Avenue. In 1851 a turnpike company was chartered by the State of Pennsylvania to pave the Pittsburgh end of the road, and to connect it with South Eighteenth Street. After this construction, the northern end of Brownsville Road connected to S. Eighteenth Street at the crossing of the Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railway. Many cemeteries were sited along the road as part of the Rural Cemetery Movement. In the 1880s, an \\"electric road\\" was built from Mount Oliver to the Concord Presbyterian Church, an area of Carrick also known as Crailo or Spiketown. Brownsville Road became a route out of the city for amusement and entertainment, including prize fighting. 20th century Streetcar tracks of the Pittsburgh Railways Co. ran down the road until 1971, ending just past the border of Pittsburgh at the \\"Brentwood Loop\\". They were part of the 53 Carrick, the 53's rush-hour variant 47 Carrick via Tunnel, and the 77/54 North Side‚ÄìCarrick via Bloomfield (\\"Flying Fraction\\"), streetcar runs.

The living quarters were built as a vernacular 1-story brick structure. The lighthouse operated during the Great Lakes navigation seasons from 1869 until 1906. The design was so successful that the Lighthouse Board chose to use this 1868 design in the construction of Eagle Harbor Light in 1871; White River Light in 1875; and Sand Island Light in 1881.Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, Sand Island Light.

Correspondence files in the National Archives in Washington show that Davenport made weekly trips through the snow to the lighthouse to report on its condition to the District Inspector in Milwaukee. Perhaps more importantly, these letters also show that he may have played a critical role in the opening of navigation every spring by reporting weekly, and sometimes even more frequently, on ice conditions in the Straits. Because Davenport was the only Straits keeper to submit such frequent reports, it would appear that the Inspector used these reports to gain an understanding as to when navigation would be open throughout the lakes. =Preservation= Historic image of McGulpin Point Light In 1906, the McGulpin Point Light was deactivated and privatized due to the Lighthouse Board's judgment that the nearby Old Mackinac Point Light was performing an adequate job of marking the Straits of Mackinac.Michigan Lighthouse Conservancy, McGulpin Point Light. At some point after deactivation, the lighthouse tower's lantern room was removed, and the building passed into private ownership. The building then entered service as a private residence.Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, McGulpin Point Lighthouse. In 2005, the lighthouse and adjoining were placed on the market for an asking price of $1.75 million by the Peppler family. In early 2008, the price was $974,900. In June 2008. the governing board of Emmet County voted to purchase the McGulpin Point Lighthouse and of surrounding lakefront property, including of Lake Michigan footage, and some adjacent property for visitor parking, for $720,000. The county also allocated $25,000 for signs, plaques, a flagpole, and promotional materials to advertise and announce the lighthouse as a new historic resource of the Straits of Mackinac region. With the assistance of the Great Lakes Lighthouse Keepers Association and private donors, Emmet County authorities had the vanished lantern room rebuilt so that the McGulpin Point Lighthouse could resume its function as a lighthouse. In April 2009, a \\"replica lantern room, fabricated by Moran Iron Works in Onaway, Michigan, was placed atop\\" the light, and a lantern was erected in the lantern room.

When extracting lower wisdom teeth, coronectomy is a treatment option involving removing the crown of the lower wisdom tooth, whilst keeping the roots in place in healthy patients. This option is given to patients as an alternative to extraction when the wisdom teeth are in close association with the inferior alveolar nerve, and so used to prevent damage to the nerve which may occur during extraction.  Advantages  Prevents potential neuropathy The risk of altered sensation is significantly lower than convention surgical removal of mandibular third molars with 8% of the cases affected temporarily and 3.6% of the cases got permanently affected. 30% of the roots will migrate post- coronectomy, erupting away for the inferior alveolar canal. This makes extraction of the remaining roots safer.  Disadvantages  There is a 5% chance of failure of coronectomy, the root will become mobilized during transection. In 5% of the cases, follicle remnants will form deep periodontal pockets which will lead to infection.  Indications  Coronectomy should be considered if there are signs that the patient is at a high risk of nerve damage during extraction: * Lower wisdom tooth is shown to be close to the inferior alveolar canal radiographically: ** Signs of narrowing or diversion of the canal ** Roots are darkened/ Canal is interrupted ** Interruption of lamina dura ** Juxta-apical region on the radiograph * Not medically compromised * Tooth vital, caries/pathology free and non-mobile  Contraindications  * Non-vital tooth * Tooth is mobile or becomes mobile during procedure * Tooth is horizontal or distoangular impacted * Medically compromised patients for example immunocompromised * Patients who are predisposed to local infection for example if they have undergone radiotherapy in the area they may have poor healing. * Caries or persistent infection  Procedure  = Preoperative assessment =  The patient  The patient should be aware of the potential risks of the procedure such as: * Dry socket * Secondary surgical procedures  Radiography  A plain film radiograph allows the proximity of the tooth to the inferior alveolar canal to be assessed. The plain film can be assessed to identify the tooth as high risk If there is; loss of the lamina dura, darkening of the canal and grooving of the root. If the mandibular third molar is deemed to be high risk, a cone beam CT (CBCT) is taken in addition to the plain film. The justification of additional radiography can be justified by the surgeon as it allows them to gain further information regarding the tooth roots and the inferior alveolar canal should the roots be mobilised when transecting.  Consent  Verbal consent must be attained by the surgeon prior to the procedure of a coronectomy. Additionally consent must be gained if removal of the roots is required due to mobilisation. The patient should be informed of early and late infection meaning the roots may need removing. = Operative technique = # Long buccal infiltration and anterior buccal infiltration both with 4% articaine, 1:10000ppm of epinephrine. This can be supplemented with an inferior dental block using 2% lidocaine, 1:80000 epinephrine. # The third molar is exposed by raising a buccal triangular mucoperiosteal fold thickness flap. # A fissure bur is used to create a buccal gutter of bone and to expose the ACJ. # Drill directly into pulp at intersection of buccal groove and ACJ. # This cut is lateralised to create a horizontal groove below the level of the ACJ. # The crown can be fractured off the roots using a small elevator such as coupland number 1 or straight Warwick James. # Care must be taken to not apply too much torque to the tooth so minimising root mobilisation. # Use a rose head bur to remove enamel fragments. # Remaining roots should sit a few millimeters below the alveolar crestal bone level, where the pulp should not be touched. # Then follow up with closing the area and suturing. # Post operative chlorohexidine mouth wash or gel can be prescribed, however antibiotics should not be prescribed unless there is pericoronal infection. = Post operative complications =  Early  If the patient presents with dry socket, irrigate with chlorohexidine mouthwash and place resorbable dressing such as Alvogyl. If the patient has recurrent infection, consideration to remove the roots should be noted.  Late  In a few cases the remaining roots may erupt which can minimise the morbidity of the inferior alveolar nerve, however the roots may be in close contact to the inferior alveolar nerve requiring surgical separation.

Ferris was a follower of Swedenborgianism and clashed with the Mormons during his six months in Utah. A biographer wrote: \\"He could not suppress his abhorence [sic] of Mormonism nor tolerate its influences, nor accept its devotees as his neighbors, and resigned his high position, thus sacrificing great possibilities in his very promising public career.\\" From his Utah experience, Ferris wrote the 1854 book Utah and the Mormons, and his wife published her letters from this period in the 1856 book The Mormons at Home.

The pianist Jack Gibbons comments: \\"The style and form of the music take on a monumental quality‚Äîrich, thickly set textures and harmonies ... conjure up the sound world of a whole orchestra and tax the performer, both physically and mentally, to the limit.\\" The work features progressive tonality, beginning in G minor and ending in F major; this is a consequence of the piece being three consecutive elements of the cycle of 12 √©tudes, each of which is in a key a perfect fourth higher than its predecessor. The piece, including all 3 movements, is 121 pages long and takes about 50 minutes to perform. The first movement on its own, comprises 72 pages and takes over 29 minutes to play (Jack Gibbons comments that \\"the first movement has more bars in it than the entire Hammerklavier Sonata by Beethoven\\"). Alkan authorized the piece to be truncated to make \\"un morceau de concert, d'une dur√©e ordinaire\\" (a concert piece of normal duration). It may be that the composer himself performed the first movement (alone) in such a shortened version in a recital in Paris in the 1880s. It was not until in 1939 that Egon Petri gave the piece a proper performance, in its entirety, during BBC broadcasts.[ allmusic ], Concerto for solo piano in G minor (√âtudes dans tous les tons mineurs Nos. 8-10), Op. 39/8-10 Adrian Corleonis considers the Concerto to represent the most cruelly taxing piano work before the time of Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji and Ferruccio Busoni. Description =First movement= The first movement, which requires almost half an hour to play and has 1342 bars, is marked \\"Allegro assai\\". Performance demands tremendous physical endurance, and great technical skills to cover features including arpeggios, octave runs, scales, leaps, grace notes, alternating hands, swiftly changing block chord motifs, tremolos, and trills executed by the fourth and fifth fingers with the melody played on the same hand. Alkan stays close to the classical sonata form, using a double exposition, but the exposition and development sections are expanded greatly. center The opening bars, constituting the first theme, are marked \\"quasi-trombe\\" (like trumpets). Such markings appear frequently throughout the score to indicate the orchestral instrument the pianist is supposed to evoke. After this theme is exposed, the contrasting, more lyrical second theme begins. This second theme is used as a contrast to both the first theme itself and, more generally, any difficult virtuosic passages. center A third theme, more heroic in nature and in the major key, enters after some development of the first two themes. The 'solo' entry following discussion of these themes is of a Chopinesque, quasi- improvisatory nature. A notable feature of the movement is the very extended passage on a constant 'pedal' note of G, preceding the recapitulation section. =Second movement= The second movement is marked \\"Adagio\\". The introductory section is marked \\"quasi-celli\\". =Third movement= The opening bars for the 3rd movement. The final movement marked \\"Allegretto alla barbaresca\\", which commences in the 'wrong' key of D major, features technical difficulties comparable with those of the first movement, including larger leaps and a more pervasive use of 3-against-4 polyrhythms. One passage contains the unique marking 'quasi-ribeche', i.e. like rebecs, a mediaeval stringed instrument derived from the Arabic rebab. Orchestration The first movement of the Concerto was orchestrated by Karl Klindworth. A first version was made in 1872 (the ms. is now in the library of the Royal College of Music in London), and was apparently submitted to Alkan himself shortly before the latter's death, having already been approved by Hans von B√ºlow. Klindworth produced a second version, which was performed in Berlin in 1902 with Klindworth conducting, the soloist being Jos√© Vianna da Motta, to whom this version was dedicated. The orchestrated version takes considerable liberties with the original, with many passages extended, truncated or altered. Other attempts at orchestrating the Concerto were made by Alkan's possible son √âlie-Miriam Delaborde and by the American composer Mark Starr.* A recording of Klindworth's 1902 version was issued in 1997 by Naxos Records with Dmitry Feofanov as soloist. Discography Despite the work's great technical difficulties, there are now a number of recordings of the work; notable ones include those by Jack Gibbons, Marc-Andr√© Hamelin, John Ogdon, Mark Latimer, Ronald Smith, Stephanie McCallum, Vincenzo Maltempo and St√©phanie Elbaz.

Blakely Auto was founded by Dick Blakely to market affordable sports cars in the spirit of the legendary Lotus Seven: compact, lightweight, and with excellent handling.Mike Knepper, \\"Blakely Bearcat & Bantam\\", Road & Track November 1975 The Bantam's design inspiration was the Dutton,p 152, The Complete Guide to Kit Cars, Auto Parts and Accessories. R. M. Kutner, 1980: Auto Logic, Wilmington, Delaware, USA a Lotus Seven replica built in Britain. The Bantam was introduced in 1972 as Blakely's first offering, followed by the larger Bearcat and eventually by the Bernardi. Production of the Bantam continued into the 1980s, when the model was renamed the Hawk, and stopped with the dissolution of Bernardi Auto Works in the later 1980s. Design and construction The Bantam was a compact, two-seater design with a front-mid-engine placement and rear-wheel drive. The car had fixed-position seats, flat windshield, outboard front fenders, and headlights on stalks. The hood comprised a top and sides protecting the engine, and was hinged at the front for easy access to the engine area. Behind the cab, a full-width roll-hoop had four points of connection to the chassis. The design was also notable for what it lacked: roof, doors, and trunk, among other conventional features. Dispensing with these items kept the body simple and rigid, and most importantly kept car weight to a minimum. Blakely stated that the Bantam weighed 680 kg (1500 pounds), more than the Lotus Seven's 500 kg but significantly less than most sports cars of the time. Assembly time for the simple kit was estimated by the factory at 100‚Äì200 hours for a novice builder. For suspension, engine, transmission, and electrical components, the Bantam's preferred donor car was the 1971‚Äì1980 Ford Pinto. Builders could also use parts from close relatives like the 1971‚Äì1980 Mercury Bobcat and the 1974‚Äì1978 Ford Mustang II. This family of donor vehicles gave the Bantam rack-and-pinion steering, A-arm independent front suspension, front disk brakes, and a good selection of engine choices. The car's small frame suited small engines. Factory- recommended options in the donor family included Ford's 1.6 liter, 2 liter, or 2.3 liter 4-cylinder Pinto / Bobcat engines. The Mazda rotary engine was another choice.p 83, The Big Guide To Kit and Specialty Cars: American Classics from the Past and Present. Harold W Pace, 2000, 2002: Big Car Books The Lotus Seven and Dutton replica designs that inspired the Bantam were built using a space frame. Blakely chose a somewhat simpler design using 14-gauge metal tubing with some boxing-in around the engine compartment. This frame was more three-dimensional than the frame used on the company's larger Bearcat and Bernardi models, and presumably stiffer. It did not, however, have sheet metal fixed directly to frame members, a stiffening approach used around the transmission tunnel and passenger area in some designs similar to the Lotus Seven. Instead, a separate fiberglass body was mounted on the pre-fabricated chassis, bolting into place at several points. The Pinto donor's lower front A-arms were used in the front suspension, with factory-supplied upper A-arms. The rear suspension was built by cutting the donor's leaf springs in half, and mounting one left half and one right half behind the cab to suspend and locate the solid rear axle. Contemporary reports praised the Bantam's performance and handling, as well as the fit and finish of the kit car components. Despite these accolades, few Bantams (and indeed few Lotus replicas of any type) were sold in the US in the 1970s and 1980s. Larger, heavier V8-powered sports cars, like the numerous AC Cobra replicas, were more popular, as were kits built on the popular Volkswagen chassis.

Japanese immigration to Uruguay began in the early 20th century. It was characterized to be small in number and mainly indirect, that is, Japanese immigrant previously had been established in another South American country but later moving to Uruguay, although some came directly from Japan. The immigration wave happened in two periods, the first since the early 20th century until before World War II and the latter since the mid-1950s to 1960s. History The first South American country that Japanese people settled was Brazil. But when Brazil decided to halt Japanese Brazil immigration in 1930s, Uruguay became one of the countries to welcome the Japanese settlers to populate the unpopulated areas. Most of them remained in the capital, Montevideo. When World War II began, there was anti-Japanese sentiment, especially from German Uruguayans and Italian Uruguayans. Japanese language teaching in schools and newspaper and book publishing in Japanese were prohibited. After the end of the war, hundreds of Japanese refugees were still permitted by Uruguayan government to settle. In recent decades, many Japanese settlers arrived especially as businessmen to profit in the country. In 2001, Princess Sayako inaugurated the Japanese Garden of Montevideo.

Biography  Charles B. Towns was born in Georgia in the year 1862 on a small farm. In his youth he worked as a farm hand; he later moved into railroading and eventually sold life insurance at which he was successful. He then moved to New York and between 1901‚Äì1904 he had a partnership in a brokerage firm that failed. It was at this time he was approached by a mysterious unnamed individual who claimed that he had a cure for drug addictions such as heroin, opium and alcoholism. The mysterious individual suggested to Towns they could make a lot of money from it.Pittman, pp. 83-4. In spite of Towns' own doctor stating the cure was ridiculous, Towns set out to find addicted people by placing ads for \\"drug fiends\\" who wanted to be cured.Colliers Magazine, The ‚ÄúWhite Hope‚Äù for Drug Victims, P.C. MacFarlane, Nov. 29, 1913, p. 17 Towns by this time had read all the known literature on drug addiction and alcoholism. By this trial and error approach Towns refined his cure. Towns' reputation spread in the criminal underworld and he treated addicted gangsters. He involved Dr. Alexander Lambert in his venture. Dr. Lambert was a professor at Cornell University Medical College, who as a physician to President Theodore Roosevelt informed various people in government about the Towns-Lambert cure. Towns was eventually sent by the US government to China to assist with the recovery of some of the 160 million drug addicts in the country. By 1908 while in China, Towns claimed to have cured thousands by his methods. Between the years 1910 and 1920 he aided in the drafting of the Boylan Bill and the Harrison Act.Pittman, pp. 84-5. Towns claimed a 90% success rate from his cure based on the reasoning that those people he never heard from again had been cured.Pittman, p. 86. Towns' reputation by the 1920s had greatly diminished in the medical community as his claims regarding his cure became more exaggerated. The Towns-Lambert cure bordered on quackery.Pittman, pp. 86-7. Lambert eventually broke off his association with Towns Hospital. Towns was making claims that his cure was guaranteed to work for any compulsive behavior, from morphinism to nicotinism to caffeinism, to kleptomania and bedwetting. Lambert realized that the percentage of those deemed to be cured needed to be greatly reduced since he had observed that a number of people over the years kept returning for cure after cure.Latimer, Dean and Goldberg, Jeff Flowers in Blood p. 249. Publisher Franklin Watts, 1981. During the 1920s a large part of the hospital revenues was from repeat business.Hartigan, Francis. Bill W. p. 97. Thomas Dunne Books, St. Martins Press, 2000. The Belladonna Cure The formula for Towns- Lambert cure was the deliriant, Atropa belladonna, also called deadly nightshade. The effects of belladonna include delirium, hallucinations, light sensitivity, confusion, and dry mouth. The second ingredient in the mixture was another deliriant, Hyoscyamus niger, also known as henbane, hog's bean, or insane root. It contained two alkaloids, hyoscyamine and hyoscine. The third major ingredient was the dried bark or berries of Xanthoxylum americanum, or prickly ash, added to help with diarrhea and intestinal cramps.Pittman, pp. 164-6. The dosage given was determined by the physiologic reaction of each patient. When the face became flushed, the throat dry, and the eyes dilated, the amount of the mixture was reduced or stopped.Pittman, p. 165. The mixture was given every hour, day and night, for nearly 50 hours. The end of the treatment was marked by the abundance of stools and then castor oil was given to the patient as a further purgative. The treatment was also described as 'puke and purge'.Alcoholics Anonymous, p. 101. Every 12 hours the patient was given CC (Compound Cathartic) pills and Blue Mass. These were 19th century medications of varying composition. Blue Mass included mercury, and was prescribed for a cornucopia of ailments. When a patient was admitted to the hospital while intoxicated or at the end of a spree, the first thing that was done was to put the patient to sleep. The only medication given prior to the hypnotic was the four CC pills. The hypnotic Lambert found best contained chloral hydrate and morphine along with one or two grams of paraldehyde. If the patient went to sleep easily on this hypnotic it was safe to wake him every hour for his belladonna regimen. Dr Lambert believed it was important to administer a small amount of strychnine every four hours.Pittman, pp. 167-8. The week following the treatment a diet of a special tonic and simple and easy to digest meals would relax the patient.Pittman, p. 169. Towns Hospital Charles B. Towns Hospital was located at 293 Central Park West in Manhattan.Cheevers, p. 114. Towns started the hospital in 1901, and the roaring twenties and the increase in alcoholism made it successful. However, after the stock market crash of 1929 admissions to the hospital had significantly declined. The hospital aimed at drying out the well-to-do patient. It was an expensive detoxification facility and one was not admitted unless the fee was paid in advance or a backer guaranteed to pay the fee which in those days was $200 to $350 for a five-day stay. At this time the Chief of Staff was Dr. William Duncan Silkworth. Silkworth had lost all his savings in the market collapse and he had come to Towns to help alcoholics. Literature Towns wrote three important books on alcoholism. These were Habits That Handicap in 1915, which was given a review in the New York Times, Reclaiming the Drinker in 1931, and Alcohol and Drug Sickness in 1934. Influences =Corporations= It was Towns' belief that lack of occupation was the destroyer of men; helping the alcoholic was useless if the man had no job to which he could return. He promoted the idea of educational plans to enlighten people on the hazards of drinking along with the idea that society was to blame for the problem of alcohol hence society needed to take responsibility for those who lost control of their drinking.Pittman, p. 163. It was during the period from 1910 to the 1930s that Towns encouraged corporations and big institutions to help alcoholics while they were still on the job.Pittman, p. 87. =Alcoholics Anonymous= Bill Wilson, cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), was admitted to Towns Hospital three times between 1933 and 1934. On his third and last stay he showed signs of delirium tremensAlcoholics Anonymous \\"The Big Book\\" 4th edition, p. 13. and was treated with the Belladonna Cure. He thought this would help his alcoholism but he inevitably drank within 3 months of leaving the hospital after \\"successfully\\" completing the Belladonna Cure. It was only after meeting a member of the Oxford, Ebby Thacher, who is later discussed, and undergoing the Oxford Group's \\"soul surgery\\", did he experience a \\"white light experience\\" or a spiritual awakening. After that experience, he never drank again. Wilson's description of his experience: \\"All at once I found myself crying out, \\"If there is a God, let Him show himself! I am ready to do anything, anything! Suddenly the room lit up with a great white light. I was caught up in an ecstasy which there are no words to describe. It seemed to me in my mind's eye, that I was on a mountain and that a wind not of air but of spirit was blowing. And then it burst upon me that I was a free man. Slowly the ecstasy subsided. I lay there on the bed, but now for a time I was in another world, a new world of consciousness... and I thought to myself, \\"So this is the God of the preachers!\\" A great peace stole over me.\\"Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age (1957), William G. Wilson, p. 63. Earlier that evening, Wilsons old drinking buddy, Ebby Thacher, a member of the Oxford Group, who had impressed Wilson by going sober with help of spirituality, had visited and tried to persuade Wilson to turn himself over to the care of a Christian deity who would liberate him from alcohol.An Alcoholic‚Äôs Savior: God, Belladonna or Both? New York Times, April 19, 2010. Towns was a supporter and creditor of Alcoholics Anonymous, lending Wilson $2500 ($38000 in 2008 dollar values)Inflation Calculator: http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl to enable him to write what became \\"The Big Book\\" of Alcoholics Anonymous.Alcoholics Anonymous, p. 196. He later told the AA story to a writer who had it published in Liberty which led to the sale of several hundred Big Books.The 1939 Liberty Magazine Article:http://www.barefootsworld.net/aalibertymag1939.html He also offered Wilson, who had been unemployed for several years, a job as a lay therapist, which Wilson declined.Pittman, pp. 157-8.

Gaupp was an assistant to Carl Wernicke (1848‚Äì1905) and Karl Bonhoeffer (1868‚Äì1948) at Breslau, and afterwards worked with Emil Kraepelin (1856‚Äì1926) at the Universities of Heidelberg and Munich. From 1908 to 1936 he was a professor of psychiatry at the University of T√ºbingen. One of his assistants was Ernst Kretschmer. Following World War II, he was departmental head of health and welfare for the city of Stuttgart (1945‚Äì48). Gaupp performed numerous investigations of psychological disorders, and is remembered for his case studies of mass-murderer Ernst August Wagner (1874‚Äì1938). He was particularly interested in correlations between personality and psychosis, and was an advocate of \\"pastoral psychology\\". For a period of time, he was also editor of the Zentralblatt f√ºr Nervenheilkunde und Psychiatrie. Sometime shortly after the passage by decree, on 15 September 1935, of the \\"Nuremberg Laws\\"(officially \\"Laws for the Protection of German Blood and Honor\\"), Gaupp came to the support of a local physician, Albrecht Schroeder (pictured at left in image below), a collegiate fraternity brother in a non-fighting order, die Igel (the Hedgehogs), to which Gaupp also belonged. With the passage of the Nuremberg Laws and the preemption of organizational authority to permit Jewish membership in non-dueling fraternal orders (Jews had never been permitted to join German dueling orders), Schroeder's status was made precarious because he was married to a Jew, n√©e Felicia Rosenstein of Bad Cannstatt, an outer district of Stuttgart. At a meeting convened of the general membership to decide upon Schroeder's suitability for membership given Schroeder's marital status and his \\"Mischling\\" (mixed race) children, Gaupp, otherwise unaffiliated with Schroeder (Gaupp was 65 at the time, Schroeder 44; and the two had never before met), declared before those assembled: \\"Wenn der Schroeder raus muss, dann geh ich auch.\\" (If Schroeder goes, then I go, too.) Schroeder withdrew his petition sometime before final disposition by the fraternity towards his case, and Gaupp himself left the organization voluntarily around the same time, as he had pledged doing on behalf of Schroeder. The two men remained close friends until Gaupp's death in 1953.An account of this episode is made in article authored by Schroeder's grandson, Matthew T. Witt, entitled \\"Sorrowful Empire, Distempered Union: Negative Dialectics and the Art(s) of Freedom,\\" published in the journal Administrative Theory & Praxis, March, 2008 (Vol. 30, Issue 1).

Early life Burgwyn was born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to Henry King Burgwyn, Sr. and Ann Greenough Burgwyn while his parents were vacationing there. He was the second cousin of Brig. Gen George B. Anderson. Burgwyn grew up in Northampton County, North Carolina, at Thornberry, the family plantation. He attended Burlington College in North Carolina. Hoping for, but never receiving, an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Burgwyn instead graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1857. He then graduated from the Virginia Military Institute as a member of the class of 1861. Burgwyn spent a few tours as a recruiting officer in North Carolina and then as commandant of Camp Crabtree in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he drilled and attempted to instill discipline in the recruits.Hess, pp. 2, 18-19. Civil War In August 1861, after a personal recommendation from VMI professor Thomas Jonathan Jackson for an appointment as a Confederate officer, Burgwyn became the lieutenant colonel of the 26th North Carolina Regiment at just 19 years of age. He took part in the 26th North Carolina's fight against Ambrose E. Burnside at the Battle of New Bern and narrowly escaped capture.Hess, p. 16. The regiment next took part in the failed attack on the Union position at Malvern Hill. Burgwyn was promoted to colonel in August 1862 and took command of the regiment when its commander, Zebulon B. Vance (who Burgwyn felt was unfit for command) was elected governor of North Carolina, despite the fact that the 26th North Carolina's brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Robert Ransom was against the promotion.Hess, pp. 7-9, 34-35. Ransom and Burgwyn disliked each other and the 26th was transferred from Ransom's command to the brigade of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew. Burgwyn spent much of the fall and winter of 1862 in eastern North Carolina with minor engagements against Union forces. During this period he was also instrumental in recruitment and conscription activity and drilling these new soldiers. Burgwyn next led the 26th at the Battle of Goldsboro Bridge. The regiment was heavily involved in Daniel Harvey Hill's New Bern and Washington Campaigns. The 26th was then sent north to join the Army of Northern Virginia, arriving shortly after the Battle of Chancellorsville. When his regiment joined Lee's Army, Burgwyn was thought to be the youngest colonel to have served to that point with the Army, and the 26th was the largest regiment in the Army. Gettysburg and death Burgwyn and the 26th North Carolina moved north toward Pennsylvania as part of the Gettysburg Campaign. The 26th engaged in brutal fighting against Solomon Meredith's vaunted Iron Brigade in Herbst's Woods on the afternoon of July 1, 1863, at Gettysburg. As the regiment was exiting Herbst's Woods and reaching the crest of McPherson's Ridge, Burgwyn was shot through both lungs and mortally wounded carrying the colors of the 26th (Historian Earl J. Hess wrote that Burgwyn had just passed the colors to a private then the colors fell again and Burgwyn turned to see what had happened and was then shot).Hess, pp. 129-30. According to William M. Cheek, an eyewitness at the time: In all, 13 color bearers for the 26th North Carolina were either killed or wounded.Hess, 132. Burgwyn died about two hours after he was wounded and was buried on the field north of the Chambersburg Pike in an empty gun case.Hess, pp. 134-36, 139. Another eye witness and a member of Burgwyn's command, Fred A. Olds, wrote in a letter that he was with the Colonel when he died: For his gallantry and heroism, Colonel Burgwyn was listed on the Confederate Honor Roll. His family had his body exhumed in 1867 and he was laid to rest in Raleigh's Historic Oakwood Cemetery.Hess, p. 308. Notes References * Hess, Earl J.

She was found dead in her tent. Her death was controversially ruled as a suicide but the evidence of rape and battery led many to believe the United States Department of Defense covered it up. Biography The daughter of Dr. John Johnson, a service veteran, and Linda Johnson, Johnson was born and grew up in Florissant, Missouri. The 5'1\\" African American honor student enlisted in the Army immediately after graduating from Hazelwood Central High School. She was deployed to Iraq and stationed in Balad. She had been there for eight weeks before her death on July 19, 2005, eight days before her 20th birthday. Death and controversy Johnson's death was officially ruled a suicide by the Department of Defense. However, her father became suspicious when he saw her body in the funeral home and decided to investigate. The Army initially refused to release information, but did so under the Freedom of Information Act after Representative William Lacy Clay, Jr. raised questions about it at the congressional hearings over Pat Tillman's death.\\"Documents and photos suggest foul play in death of Private Johnson\\" by Sandra Jordan, The St. Louis American (June 4, 2008). The autopsy report and photographs revealed Johnson had a broken nose, black eye, loose teeth, burns from a corrosive chemical on her genitals, and a gunshot wound that seemed inconsistent with suicide. Several reporters have suspected that the chemical burns were to destroy DNA evidence of a rape. Bloody footprints were discovered outside of her living quarters.The tragic story of LaVena Johnson\\" by Kate Harding, salon.com. June 27, 2008. A spokesman from the House Armed Services Committee said in June 2008 that the committee was looking into Johnson's death, but they were not yet committing to a formal investigation. Christopher Grey, chief of public affairs for the U.S. Criminal Investigative Command for the Army has said that the case remains closed as far as they are concerned.\\"House panel reviewing death of area soldier\\" by Elizabethe Holland. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. June 4, 2008. Following a February 2007 KMOV news report on Johnson's death, an online petition addressed to the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee was launched, closing with 37,319 supporters. This was followed by the creation of an official LaVena Johnson website dedicated to developments in prompting a new Army investigation of her death. The petition closed on May 24, 2008 with nearly 12,000 signatures; preparations are being made for delivery to the two committees. In July 2008, the online black activist group Color of Change launched another online petitionColorOfChange.org calling on Henry Waxman, chair of the House Oversight Committee, to conduct a hearing into LaVena Johnson's death and the Army's handling of her case and others like it. A documentary film about LaVena Johnson's family's struggle for justice was made in 2010, directed by Joan Brooker and titled LaVena Johnson: The Silent Truth. On July 19, 2011, the criminal justice students in the Cold Case Investigative Research Institute (CCIRI) run as a student club by three universities, selected Johnson's case as their case for investigation. The CCIRI's crime scene reconstruction aimed to help shed light on this case that has attracted worldwide attention. The CCIRI investigation did not agree with nor dispute the Army's findings. Sheryl McCollum of the Cold Case Investigative Research Institute calls the case \\"gut-wrenching.\\" McCollum says the institute normally spends one year on a case, but spent three years on the LaVena Johnson case. In a phone interview with St. Louis Public Radio, McCollum said that she faults the Army for poor communication, but she does not disagree with its conclusion. \\"The problem is ‚Äì number one ‚Äì the way the notification happened. And the lack of information given to that family fast enough,\\" McCollum said. \\"There was nothing about this case that we could go back to the Army to say you need to re-look at it,\\" she said. \\"We didn't have anything new.

History Previously known as the Western Highway, the road is signed as State Route 8. The Deer Park Bypass (completed 2009) carries the National Highway M8 designation while the Ballarat Road from Caroline Springs through Deer Park has the blue Route 8 shield. Route 8 continues on Ballarat Road across the Western Ring Road (opened 1996) to the inner suburb of Footscray. The freeway was originally designated in the 1969 Melbourne Transportation Plan as part of the F12 Freeway corridor. Geography Ballarat Road starts at the Footscray junction of Princes Highway (Geelong Road) in Footscray and continues west through Maidstone, Braybrook, Sunshine, Albion, Cairnlea, Deer Park, Burnside, and Caroline Springs. The major junctions along the route include the Western Ring Road and the Deer Park Bypass.  Transport  Tram route 82 runs along the Footscray section of Ballarat Road, between Gordon & Droop Streets. The Melton railway line from Southern Cross runs parallel to Ballarat Road from Sunshine about 1 km to the south, with stations at Albion, and Deer Park. Several bus routes run along Ballarat Road at various points (routes 215, 216, 220, 223, 256, 400, 406, 408, 410 and 456) with 456 continuing on the Western Freeway to Melton. With three lanes running in each direction, between Deer Park and the Western Ring Road, this was one of the worst bottlenecks in western Melbourne with traffic reaching 70,000 vehicles per day, with 10 per cent of this consisting of heavy vehicles. This caused delays, in part due to seven traffic signals between the Western Ring Road and the start of the Western Freeway. With the completion of the Deer Park Bypass traffic volumes were predicted to decrease to local traffic standard since its opening on 5 April 2009. Beyond that, to central Melbourne, Ballarat Road has a single carriageway from Braybrook and is a two lane arterial road, including one small stretch which shares the road with trams.

In partnership with the UNESCO Pacific Office in Apia, Samoa,UNESCO Pacific Office in Apia, Samoa CPAS has focused on science teaching training and communication in Pacific nations. As well as running a science journalism workshop for Pacific Island journalists in 2001, CPAS followed up in the same year with a science teacher workshop and the first Pacific Science Communication Forum.Pacific Science Communication Forum The UNESCO office in JakartaUNESCO Office in Jakarta, Indonesia invited CPAS to join a mission to Cambodia to conduct a survey to identify and assess the needs of the country with respect to science education in schools and universities. Other activities include joining with UNESCO (Apia) to help in its aims to raise social participation in science in and around the Pacific. CPAS also established, as a pilot project, the Register of Pacific Scientists, an online database for those involved with Pacific Science to record their details and/or search for other people with similar or complementary interests. Other activities of CPAS include the presentation of workshops for secondary school science teachers and others in Fiji, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Japan and New Zealand. A joint teaching program is being developed with the National University of Singapore. In South Africa, CPAS helped to develop a touring hands-on science exhibition and has been invited to work in and with various South African science centres. Teaching, Outreach and Research With a flourishing graduate program, CPAS encourages research in all aspects of science communication. Degrees are offered at all tertiary levels.CPAS Academic Programs Outreach programs within Australia include workshops for research scientists, science teachers, science and engineering students and science centre personnel, as well as the ANU Shell Questacon Science Circus.ANU Shell Questacon Science Circus CPAS has a wide research program dealing with issues at the interface of science and the public. Apart from a long-standing agenda of research in science centres, CPAS is concerned with current issues in science, with the communication agendas of scientists, and with effective communication of science concepts. The research program is interdisciplinary and contributes to the emerging framework of science communication theory. History CPAS was launched by Professor Richard Dawkins in 1996.CPAS Launch It owes it origin to the establishment, twenty years earlier, of a modest science centre in a vacant primary school in Canberra. This burgeoning science centre eventually grew into Questacon ‚Äì The National Science and Technology Centre. Questacon was the brainchild of Michael Gore,Prof. Michael Gore a senior lecturer in Physics at the Australian National University, who became its first director. An important part of its activities was outreach, supported from the beginning by sponsorship from Shell Australia. Dr Gore approached Professor Chris Bryant,Prof. Chris Bryant then Dean of Science at the Australian National University, with a proposal to set up a science circus to travel Australia, to be staffed by graduate science students enrolled in a course of science communication. Thus was born the Graduate Certificate in Science Communication that rapidly metamorphosed into a Graduate Diploma.CPAS Graduate Diploma in Science Communication This initiative proved extremely popular and it became clear that there was a hitherto undetected demand for such a course. Over the next few years, Masters and PhD courses were offered and science communication became a full-fledged graduate program. By 1994, the demand was so great that the Faculty of Science at the Australian National University agreed to fund a Lectureship in Science Communication. This was the first in Australia and, possibly, the world. Dr Susan StocklmayerDr Susan Stocklmayer was appointed to the position and immediately announced her intention of establishing a university centre for science communication. The Centre was established in 1996, with Professor Bryant as its first, interim, Director. Dr Stocklmayer took over the position in 1998, where she remains today. Awards In subsequent years, the work of CPAS has been recognised by a number of awards and honours: In 1999, CPAS, Shell Australia and Questacon jointly won the Business/Higher Education Round TableBusiness/Higher Education Round Table Award. The citation commends CPAS as ‚Äúa university centre whose brief is to empower Australians by encouraging in them the confidence of 'ownership' of modern science. It is intended to increase science awareness in the Australian community and to improve communication skills of scientists.‚Äù In 2000, its standing was such that it was designated as the first UNESCO Centre for Science Communication. In 2004, the triple partnership was awarded the Financial Review National Award for long term sponsorship, and in 2006 it won the Special Award for Excellence in the Prime Ministers Community Business Partnerships. The individual contributions of members of CPAS have also been widely recognised and they have received many personal accolades.

The band has released four studio albums and one EP. They combine elements of extreme metal such as gothic metal, death metal, doom metal and black metal with heavily orchestrated symphonic metal and progressive/power metal. History Stravaganzza became a consolidated band in 2003. The first precursor to Stravaganzza is without a doubt the band that Pepe Herrero (guitar) and Leo Jim√©nez (vocals) founded in 1993 and which later would be joined by Patricio Babasasa as a drummer: Krys√°lida, with an instrumental group just the same as in Stravaganzza (including violin and keyboards), but adding a second vocalist who sang the guttural parts. With that lineup they had already made a similar style to Stravaganzza, with obscure parts, orchestral passages but perhaps a bit more complex and anti-commercial; maybe this was the cause of it not being very understood and accepted, which would lead to it breaking up about four years later. After Krys√°lida, Leo formed with Patricio Babasasa (drums) and Edu Fern√°ndez (bass) Azabel, a band with a more aggressive style, close to death, and it was at this time when the idea of making a version of Mecano's song \\"Hijo de la luna\\" was brought up, a proposal that Stravaganzza would bring to life ten years later. Azabel dissolved after Leo's departure to well- known heavy metal band Saratoga, in which he would at last get recognition, fame and prestige, and where he would stay for eight years. On his side, Pepe Herrero, after abandoning Krys√°lida, wouldn't participate in any musical group until 2000, in which he founded Eklectika, a personal project in which, among others, he would compose some of the songs that later would appear on Stravaganzza's first album. In late 2002 Alejandro Brice√±o (drums), Edu Fern√°ndez, Pepe Herrero and Leo Jim√©nez decide to unite to make music together; for that they would also count on guitarist Paco Cinta. These five friends united under the temporary name of Dyosh, initially playing Eklectika songs. A few months later, they suggested making something more serious of this band, encouraged by the idea of being able to offer a fresh alternative to the not so varied national band scene. After the departure of Alejandro Brice√±o and Paco Cinta, Dani P√©rez, who at the time played drums for Saratoga, joined the band; at that moment Stravaganzza was born. A year later, in 2004, the band's first album, Primer Acto, was released under the discographic label Avispa. That was very well accepted by the media, being given the highest ratings on their reviews and assigning it the \\"revelation band of the year\\" award. The general public received it with awe and respect, even those who didn't like it accepted that it was a remarkable product with an excellent quality. To bring the band to the live stage they needed to have musicians who recreated the orchestrations and keyboards that appeared in the recording. For that, they counted on keyboardist Fernando Mart√≠n, and violinist Roberto Jabonero, who, a year later, would be replaced by Rodrigo Calder√≥n. The first live show was done at the Vi√±aRock 2004 stage, with a great reception by the thousands of spectators attending the event. In 2005, Stravaganzza presented their second act: Sentimientos, a more mature and elaborated work that featured the spectacular production of the late Big Simon and in which each song talks about a different feeling. It's with this work when they achieve a greater recognition and are invited to play in Berlin, at the new trends festival Popkomm. In this year they play again at Vi√±aRock festival, where they perform for the first time their version of Mecano's \\"Hijo de la luna\\", with a great acceptance by the public. They also record their first video clip, for the song \\"Miedo\\". In 2006, they released their EP, Hijo del miedo, also produced by Big Simon, work in which they capture among other songs the Hijo de la luna cover, which led them to the first place in sales on the Afive list. Right in that moment, the band underwent a great change; due to discographic matters, Edu Fern√°ndez and Dani P√©rez leave the band. After this rough hit, Leo Jim√©nez and Pepe Herrero mustered up force to not fall and face the tough and apparently impossible task of finding two substitutes for Edu and Dani. However, in a few weeks they found two great musicians and people who incarnate perfectly the band's spirit: Patricio Babasasa on bass, and Carlos Exp√≥sito on drums.

Also, teams may place players on a number of restricted lists, such as \\"injured reserve,\\" \\"unable to play,\\" \\"hold out,\\" and \\"protected.\\" For each game, teams are allowed to dress a total of eighteen players. This must include two goaltenders and sixteen runners. Rosters are filled by a combination of drafts, free agency, and trades. Each year, the league holds an entry draft with players who are 21 years of age, or if less than 21 years of age, has used or given up all NCAA or NAIA eligibility. Also, in years in which a new team is introduced the league holds an expansion draft, or in some years in which a team is ceasing operations a dispersal draft is held. The league has an annual trade deadline, which typically falls right before the final month of the season. After this deadline no players exchanged may join the new team on its playoff roster. There are two difference types of free agency in the National Lacrosse League, restricted and unrestricted. In order to qualify for restricted free agency players must have played in the league for three seasons and participated in twenty-three regular season games. A restricted free agent's club may sign the player to a qualifying offer prior to the deadline, or match any offer made by any other club after the deadline in order to retain the players services. An unrestricted free agent (‚Ä°) is any player who has reached thirty-two years of age and has played six seasons in the league. An unrestricted free agent may be \\"franchised\\" by their club.

Township of Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85 (1977), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States found that an ordinance prohibiting the posting of \\"for sale\\" and \\"sold\\" signs on real estate within the town violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protections for commercial speech..  Background  Willingboro Township, New Jersey, had been experiencing a shift in its demographics during the 1960s as the proportion of its non-white population increased from less than 1% to 18.2% in 1973. Concerned that white flight might occur, it enacted an ordinance in 1974 that prohibited its residents from having a \\"for sale\\" or \\"sold\\" sign on any real estate within the township. During the 1960s and 1970s, many communities in the United States had enacted similar laws in response to the practices of blockbusting. It was believed that by preventing the posting of these signs, residents would not know if a large number of white homeowners were attempting to sell their houses and move from the township at the same time. The intent of such laws was to prevent panic selling and to allow integration in a more gradual manner. Linmark Associates owned property that was for sale when the ordinance was passed, and filed suit in federal district court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court granted a declaration of unconstitutionality of the ordinance, but on appeal a divided Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the decision of the district court. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court.  Court's Decision  The Supreme Court had recently recognized that commercial speech had some protection in Bigelow v. Virginia,. in which the Court struck down a Virginia statute prohibiting the advertisement of out-of- state abortion procedures, and in Virginia State Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,. which struck down a statute forbidding the advertisement of prescription drug prices. Justice Marshall's decision noted that the Willingboro ordinance did not genuinely regulate the time or manner of the communication, but its content, since other signs were permitted. Rather, Willingboro proscribed particular signs, those stating \\"for sale\\" or \\"sold,\\" because the township feared that the signs will cause those residents reading them to act upon them. As such, the township's ordinance was essentially the same as the situation in Virginia State Pharmacy Board, where a statute was intended to keep information from the public. Although the purpose of the Willingboro law was to prevent irrational decisionmaking by white homeowners by keeping information on the status of real estate from them, the First Amendment does not permit the government to make such a statute. The opinion says that when there is a choice between suppressing information and the danger of its misuse if it is freely available, then the remedy under the First Amendment is more speech and not enforced silence. As there was no meaningful difference between the township's ordinance and the statute overturned in the Virginia State Pharmacy Board case, the Court concluded that the Willingboro violated the First Amendment. Justice Rehnquist did not participate in the decision. His had been the lone dissenting opinion in the Virginia State Pharmacy Board case, stating that the free speech protection of the First Amendment should be limited to social and political issues.

It provides interactive in-school and after-school programs presenting and discussing student-written work to promote community dialogue and respect for young artists. History and leadership Young Playwrights' Theater was founded in 1995 by Karen Zacar√≠as. Now a Helen Hayes Award-winning Playwright-in-Residence at Arena Stage, Zacar√≠as began volunteering her time teaching playwriting workshops in DC classrooms after returning to her hometown with a M.F.A. in playwriting from Boston University. By 1997, her workshops were so successful that she incorporated YPT as a 501c3 nonprofit organization. In 2005, when Zacar√≠as transitioned to Arena Stage, David Andrew Snider took over as Producing Artistic Director and CEO. Since then the organization has grown to employ six full-time staff members, eight professional teaching artists, and dozens of professional actors, directors and designers supporting its work on-stage and in the classroom. YPT provides thousands of students and community members annually with free in-school and after-school theater arts workshops and professional performances of student-written plays, and has created a continuum of programming at the Columbia Heights Education Campus through programming for students of Bancroft Elementary School, Lincoln Middle School and Bell Multicultural High School to gauge the long-term effects on students as they progress. Snider followed Zacar√≠as to Arena Stage in July 2012 as Director of Artistic Programming. Former Deputy Director Brigitte Pribnow Moore stepped in as Acting Executive Director and former Program Manager Nicole Jost assumed the role of Associate Artistic Director. YPT's staff operates out of the Josephine Butler Parks Center, adjacent to Meridian Hill Park in the Columbia Heights neighborhood and regularly stages performances at nearby Tivoli Theatre, a renovated 1920's Italian Renaissance Revival theater, now home to GALA Hispanic Theatre. The organization receives federal and private sector funding, as well as individual donations. Programs and performance series =In-School Playwriting Program= YPT's flagship program integrates the art of playwriting into the classroom in order to enhance student literacy, creative expression and communication. During 12 in- class workshops led by teaching artists, students explore the mechanics of language, drama, and self-expression, culminating with each student writing his or her own short play. Professional actors and directors visit the classroom throughout the process, reading students' plays and helping to bring their words to life. The most dynamic plays are chosen by a reading committee composed of professional playwrights, directors, and actors, to be performed at Tivoli Theatre by YPT's acting company in the New Play Festival and at satellite locations during the New Writers Now! series. The young authors work with a dramaturge to polish their scripts, attend rehearsals, and offer input to actors and a director during their plays' development and production. In 2012, YPT published some of the best student works. =Out-of-School Time Programming= Since 2008, YPT has hosted an after-school Young Playwrights' Workshop at its facilities in the Josephine Butler Parks Center, aimed at developing students' creative expression and collaboration by exploring theater as an ensemble. Students have written plays and performed them at the Capital Fringe Festival, Intersections at Atlas Performing Arts Center, the Source Festival and Tivoli Theatre. The workshop hosted arts delegations from China and Russia in 2012. Several schools host YPT's After-School Playwrighting Program, providing a similar collaborative, explorative writing and performance experience. Additionally, the Summer Playwriting Series, a series of playwriting workshops for local youth, is conducted at partner schools, camps and community centers, culminating in community sharing and staged readings. =Express Tour= Each fall, YPT's professional acting company tours the Greater Washington, D.C. area performing student-written plays at schools, nursing homes, hospitals, community centers and theaters, free of charge. Plays are selected from the previous school year to align with an overarching theme chosen for that year's tour. Audiences participate with actors in post-performance interactive workshops to develop their own artistic interpretations and customized storytelling experiences. The tour usually concludes with a public showcase performance at Tivoli Theatre. =Special Projects= YPT has received commissions and enjoyed partnerships with regional and international institutions including the White House, Kennedy Center, National Geographic Society, Smithsonian Institution's Discovery Theater, Folger Shakespeare Library, Woolly Mammoth, Carnegie Institute, Theater J, Round House Theatre, African Continuum, Busboys and Poets, Washington Parks and People, Capitol Hill Arts Workshop (CHAW), the Canadian Embassy, EsArtes of Suchitoto, El Salvador, and a Youth Village in Israel. Evaluations and assessments Written literacy evaluations and self- assessments are conducted during initial and final workshop visits at program sites, and assessment results are judged via a specific rubric developed by YPT's outside evaluator, faculty and staff, aimed at showing the changes in students' literacy, their abilities with language and addressing District of Columbia Public Schools and national English Language Arts Standards, as well as measurable changes in attitude/engagement in their own education. The President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts have called on YPT to share their successful evaluations and assessments to advance the field of arts education on a national level. Recognition YPT has received several regional and national awards, most notably the 2006 District of Columbia Mayor's Arts Award for Outstanding Contribution to Arts Education, a 2009 Helen Hayes nomination for Best New Play for Chasing George Washington: A White House Adventure, the Eugene and Agnes Meyer Foundation 2009 Exponent Award, the 2010 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award (formerly the Coming Up Taller Award), the HandsOn Greater DC Cares Essence of Leadership Award in 2011 and Community Impact Award in 2012, recognition in the 2009-2010 Catalogue for Philanthropy, and most recently an honorable mention for The Washington Post 2012 Award for Excellence in Nonprofit Management.

Knight, a rock photographer born and raised in Honolulu, who holds the distinction of being one of the first photographers to capture Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, and the last to photograph Stevie Ray Vaughan. Over the course of the film, Robert revisits the friends and idols of his past, such as Jeff Beck, Slash, Carlos Santana, and Steve Vai, while helping to kick-start the careers of the Australian band Sick Puppies. Fiercely protective of his ever-expanding photo archive, the photographer struggles with his mother's costly around-the-clock care, and debates whether to sell the 200,000+ photos that mean so much to him. Life Hoping to escape a somewhat sheltered upbringing, courtesy of his mother and Baptist minister father, Robert became a travel agent at the age of 16 and worked up the credits to fly to London. With the help of a friend, Robert found himself on the set of the Michelangelo Antonioni film Blowup, and concluded that he had to be a part of what was happening in the culture at that time, and saved up to buy a camera. With an apparent combination of luck and friendliness, Knight began to get himself into the press pit at rock concerts, and in the process befriended such rock 'n roll luminaries as Jeff Beck, Elton John, and the members of Led Zeppelin. Robert became very close with Stevie Ray Vaughan, and is still haunted by his place in history as Stevie's final photographer.

The main reason for applying masking to a data field is to protect data that is classified as personally identifiable information, sensitive personal data, or commercially sensitive data. However, the data must remain usable for the purposes of undertaking valid test cycles. It must also look real and appear consistent. It is more common to have masking applied to data that is represented outside of a corporate production system. In other words, where data is needed for the purpose of application development, building program extensions and conducting various test cycles. It is common practice in enterprise computing to take data from the production systems to fill the data component, required for these non-production environments. However, this practice is not always restricted to non-production environments. In some organizations, data that appears on terminal screens to call centre operators may have masking dynamically applied based on user security permissions (e.g. preventing call centre operators from viewing Credit Card Numbers in billing systems). The primary concern from a corporate governance perspective is that personnel conducting work in these non-production environments are not always security cleared to operate with the information contained in the production data. This practice represents a security hole where data can be copied by unauthorized personnel, and security measures associated with standard production level controls can be easily bypassed. This represents an access point for a data security breach. The overall practice of data masking at an organizational level should be tightly coupled with the Test Management Practice and underlying Methodology and should incorporate processes for the distribution of masked test data subsets. Background Data involved in any data masking or obfuscation must remain meaningful at several levels: # The data must remain meaningful for the application logic. For example, if elements of addresses are to be obfuscated and city and suburbs are replaced with substitute cities or suburbs, then, if within the application there is a feature that validates postcode or post code lookup, that function must still be allowed to operate without error and operate as expected. The same is also true for credit-card algorithm validation checks and Social Security Number validations. # The data must undergo enough changes so that it is not obvious that the masked data is from a source of production data. For example, it may be common knowledge in an organisation that there are 10 senior managers all earning in excess of $300K. If a test environment of the organisation's HR System also includes 10 identities in the same earning-bracket, then other information could be pieced together to reverse-engineer a real-life identity. Theoretically, if the data is obviously masked or obfuscated, then it would be reasonable for someone intending a data breach to assume that they could reverse engineer identity-data if they had some degree of knowledge of the identities in the production data-set. Accordingly, data obfuscation or masking of a data-set applies in such a manner as to ensure that identity and sensitive data records are protected - not just the individual data elements in discrete fields and tables. #The masked values may be required to be consistent across multiple databases within an organization when the databases each contain the specific data element being masked. Applications may initially access one database and later access another one to retrieve related information where the foreign key has been masked (e.g. a call center application first brings up data from a customer master database and, depending on the situation, subsequently accesses one of several other databases with very different financial products.) This requires that the masking applied is repeatable (the same input value to the masking algorithm always yields the same output value) but not able to be reverse engineered to get back to the original value. Additional constraints as mentioned in (1) above may also apply depending on the data element(s) involved. Where different character sets are used across the databases that need to connect in this scenario, a scheme of converting the original values to a common representation will need to be applied, either by the masking algorithm itself or prior to invoking said algorithm. Techniques =Substitution= Substitution is one of the most effective methods of applying data masking and being able to preserve the authentic look and feel of the data records. It allows the masking to be performed in such a manner that another authentic- looking value can be substituted for the existing value. There are several data field types where this approach provides optimal benefit in disguising the overall data subset as to whether or not it is a masked data set. For example, if dealing with source data which contains customer records, real life surname or first name can be randomly substituted from a supplied or customised look up file. If the first pass of the substitution allows for applying a male first name to all first names, then the second pass would need to allow for applying a female first name to all first names where gender equals \\"F.\\" Using this approach we could easily maintain the gender mix within the data structure, apply anonymity to the data records but also maintain a realistic looking database, which could not easily be identified as a database consisting of masked data. This substitution method needs to be applied for many of the fields that are in DB structures across the world, such as telephone numbers, zip codes and postcodes, as well as credit card numbers and other card type numbers like Social Security numbers and Medicare numbers where these numbers actually need to conform to a checksum test of the Luhn algorithm. In most cases, the substitution files will need to be fairly extensive so having large substitution datasets as well the ability to apply customized data substitution sets should be a key element of the evaluation criteria for any data masking solution. =Shuffling= The shuffling method is a very common form of data obfuscation. It is similar to the substitution method but it derives the substitution set from the same column of data that is being masked. In very simple terms, the data is randomly shuffled within the column. However, if used in isolation, anyone with any knowledge of the original data can then apply a \\"What If\\" scenario to the data set and then piece back together a real identity. The shuffling method is also open to being reversed if the shuffling algorithm can be deciphered. Shuffling, however, has some real strengths in certain areas. If for instance, the end of year figures for financial information in a test data base, one can mask the names of the suppliers and then shuffle the value of the accounts throughout the masked database. It is highly unlikely that anyone, even someone with intimate knowledge of the original data could derive a true data record back to its original values. =Number and date variance= The numeric variance method is very useful for applying to financial and date driven information fields. Effectively, a method utilising this manner of masking can still leave a meaningful range in a financial data set such as payroll. If the variance applied is around +/- 10% then it is still a very meaningful data set in terms of the ranges of salaries that are paid to the recipients. The same also applies to the date information. If the overall data set needs to retain demographic and actuarial data integrity, then applying a random numeric variance of +/- 120 days to date fields would preserve the date distribution, but it would still prevent traceability back to a known entity based on their known actual date or birth or a known date value for whatever record is being masked. =Encryption= Encryption is often the most complex approach to solving the data masking problem. The encryption algorithm often requires that a \\"key\\" be applied to view the data based on user rights. This often sounds like the best solution, but in practice the key may then be given out to personnel without the proper rights to view the data. This then defeats the purpose of the masking exercise. Old databases may then get copied with the original credentials of the supplied key and the same uncontrolled problem lives on. Recently, the problem of encrypting data while preserving the properties of the entities got recognition and a newly acquired interest among the vendors and academia. New challenge gave birth to algorithms called FPE (format preserving encryption). They are based on the accepted AES algorithmic mode that makes them being recognized by NIST. =Nulling out or deletion= Sometimes a very simplistic approach to masking is adopted through applying a null value to a particular field. The null value approach is really only useful to prevent visibility of the data element. In almost all cases, it lessens the degree of data integrity that is maintained in the masked data set. It is not a realistic value and will then fail any application logic validation that may have been applied in the front end software that is in the system under test. It also highlights to anyone that wishes to reverse engineer any of the identity data that data masking has been applied to some degree on the data set. =Masking out= Character scrambling or masking out of certain fields is also another simplistic yet very effective method of preventing sensitive information to be viewed. It is really an extension of the previous method of nulling out, but there is a greater emphasis on keeping the data real and not fully masked all together. This is commonly applied to credit card data in production systems. For instance, an operator at a call centre might bill an item to a customer's credit card. They then quote a billing reference to the card with the last 4 digits of XXXX XXXX xxxx 6789. As an operator they can only see the last 4 digits of the card number, but once the billing system passes the customer's details for charging, the full number is revealed to the payment gateway systems. This system is not very effective for test systems, but it is very useful for the billing scenario detailed above. It is also commonly known as a dynamic data masking method. =Additional complex rules= Additional rules can also be factored into any masking solution regardless of how the masking methods are constructed. Product agnostic White Papers are a good source of information for exploring some of the more common complex requirements for enterprise masking solutions, which include Row Internal Synchronisation Rules, Table Internal Synchronisation Rules and Table to Table Synchronisation Rules. Different types Data masking is tightly coupled with building test data. Two major types of data masking are static and on-the-fly data masking. =Static data masking= Static Data Masking is usually performed on the golden copy of the database, but can also be applied to values in other sources, including files. In DB environments, production DBAs will typically load table backups to a separate environment, reduce the dataset to a subset that holds the data necessary for a particular round of testing (a technique called \\"subsetting\\"), apply data masking rules while data is in stasis, apply necessary code changes from source control, and/or and push data to desired environment. = Deterministic data masking = Deterministic Masking is the process of replacing a value in a column with the same value whether in the same row, the same table, the same database/schema and between instances/servers/database types. Example: A database has multiple tables, each with a column that has first names. With deterministic masking the first name will always be replaced with the same value ‚Äì ‚ÄúLynne‚Äù will always become ‚ÄúDenise‚Äù ‚Äì wherever ‚ÄúLynne‚Äù may be in the database . =Statistical data obfuscation= There are also alternatives to the static data masking that rely on stochastic perturbations of the data that preserve some of the statistical properties of the original data. Examples of statistical data obfuscation methods include differential privacy and the DataSifter method . =On-the-fly data masking= On-the-Fly Data Masking happens in the process of transferring data from environment to environment without data touching the disk on its way. The same technique is applied to \\"Dynamic Data Masking\\" but one record at a time. This type of data masking is most useful for environments that do continuous deployments as well as for heavily integrated applications. Organizations that employ continuous deployment or continuous delivery practices do not have the time necessary to create a backup and load it to the golden copy of the database. Thus, continuously sending smaller subsets (deltas) of masked testing data from production is important. In heavily integrated applications, developers get feeds from other production systems at the very onset of development and masking of these feeds is either overlooked and not budgeted until later, making organizations non-compliant. Having on-the-fly data masking in place becomes essential. =Dynamic data masking= Dynamic Data Masking is similar to On-the-Fly Data Masking but it differs in the sense that On-the-Fly Data Masking is about copying data from one source to another source so that the latter can be shared. Dynamic data masking happens at runtime, dynamically, and on-demand so that there doesn't need to be a second data source where to store the masked data dynamically. Dynamic data masking enables several scenarios, many of which revolve around strict privacy regulations e.g. the Singapore Monetary Authority or the Privacy regulations in Europe. Dynamic data masking is attribute-based and policy-driven. Policies include: * Doctors can view the medical records of patients they are assigned to (data filtering) * Doctors cannot view the SSN field inside a medical record (data masking). Dynamic data masking can also be used to encrypt or decrypt values on the fly especially when using format-preserving encryption. Several standards have emerged in recent years to implement dynamic data filtering and masking. For instance, XACML policies can be used to mask data inside databases. There are five possible technologies to apply Dynamic data masking: # In the Database: Database receives the SQL and applies rewrite to returned masked result set. Applicable for developers & DBAs but not for applications (because connection pools, application caching and data-bus hide the application user identity from the database and can also cause application data corruption). # Network Proxy between the application and the database: Captures the SQL and applies rewrite on the select request. Applicable for developers & DBAs with simple 'select'requests but not for stored procedures (which the proxy only identifies the exec.) and applications (because connection pools, application caching and data-bus hide the application user identity from the database and can also cause application data corruption). # Network Proxy between the end- user and the application: identifying text strings and replacing them. This method is not applicable for complex applications as it will easily cause corruption when the real-time string replacement is unintentionally applied. # Code changes in the applications & XACML: code changes are usually hard to perform, impossible to maintain and not applicable for packaged applications. Some applications like Oracle E- Business Suite, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards allow adding an API code to their application code to enable dynamic data masking. # Within the application run-time: By instrumenting the application run-time, policies are defined to rewrite the result set returned from the data sources, while having full visibility to the application user. This method is the only applicable way to dynamically mask complex applications as it enables control to the data request, data result and user result. # Supported by a browser plugin: In the case of SaaS or local web applications, browser add-ons can be configured to mask data fields corresponding to precise CSS Selectors. This can either be accomplished by marking sensitive fields in the application, for example by a HTML class or by finding the right selectors that identify the fields to be obfuscated or masked. =Data masking and the cloud= In latest years, organizations develop their new applications in the cloud more and more often, regardless of whether final applications will be hosted in the cloud or on- premises. The cloud solutions as of now allow organizations to use Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS, Platform as a Service or PaaS, and Software as a Service or SaaS. There are various modes of creating test data and moving it from on-premises databases to the cloud, or between different environments within the cloud. Dynamic Data Masking becomes even more critical in cloud when customers need to protecting PII data while relying on cloud providers to administer their databases. Data masking invariably becomes the part of these processes in SDLC as the development environments' SLAs are usually not as stringent as the production environments' SLAs regardless of whether application is hosted in the cloud or on-premises.

History  Magica started in February 2002 as a project of Bogdan Costea, guitarist (at that time) of a local gothic metal band, Interitus Dei. The reason for starting this band was Bogdan's desire to play the music that he likes: heavy metal & melodic rock. The recordings for the first album started in spring 2002. After two months of work, the material was ready. The album, entitled The Scroll of Stone, tells the story of princess Alma tricked by a demon, she loses her soul and so her quest begins. She has to find the Scroll of Stone, the only thing powerful enough to break the demon's spell. The Scroll of Stone was produced in Romania by Sigma Records and was well received by the media, in spite of the lack of promotion. The second album, Lightseeker, has been launched in October 2004 in France through Underclass Music. Magica's first video, \\"Bittersweet Nightshade\\", was ready on February 10, 2005. Magica has been featured in the famous Metallian and Rock Hard magazine. In 2006 the band had the pleasure of touring Europe opening for After Forever and Nightmare, Apocalyptica and Leaves Eyes. The third album is called Hereafter and was released at 19 October 2007 via AFM Records Germany. 2 videos were shot for this album, \\"All waters have the colour of drowning\\" and \\"Entangled\\". In November 2007, Ana was invited to take part in the huge Hellish Rock tour alongside Helloween, Gamma Ray and Axxis for 3 months of intense touring. The band's follow-up release was called Wolves and Witches and was released through AFM Records in October 2008. In 2010 the band recorded and released their follow-up, Dark Diary, through AFM. In August 2012, Magica announced on their Facebook page that the next album will be called Center of The Great Unknown, still through AFM Records.

The work was uncovered in about 1960 and purchased that year by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Fran√ßois Georges Pariset described the painting in The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, attributing it to La Tour‚Äîa likely choice given the calligraphic signature at top right: \\"G. de La Tour Fecit Luneuilla Lothar\\" (\\"G[eorges] de La Tour made this, Lun√©ville, Lorraine\\"). Its authenticity has been questioned in the intervening years, notably by the English art historian Christopher Wright, but The Fortune Teller is generally accepted as La Tour's work. The artist is better known for his chiaroscuro religious compositions, in which the figures are illuminated by a single light source and lack the elaborate costume detail of The Fortune Teller's characters. The painting catches a moment in which a young man of some wealth is having his fortune told by the old woman at right; she takes the coin from his hand, not only in payment, but as part of the ritual in which she will cross his hand with it. Most or all of the women portrayed are gypsies, and, furthering the stereotype of the time, they are depicted as thieves. As the young man is engrossed in the fortune-telling‚Äîan act which, if discovered, would have repercussions for both him and the gypsies‚Äîthe leftmost woman is stealing the coin purse from his pocket, while her companion in profile has a hand ready to receive the loot. The pale-faced girl on the boy's left is less clearly a gypsy, but is also in on the act as she cuts a medal worn by the boy from its chain. The figures in the painting are close together, as if in a play, and the composition may have been influenced by a theatrical scene. The modern discovery of the painting is said to be traced to a French prisoner of war who viewed La Tour's works in a monograph and found a likeness with a painting hung in a relative's castle. A knowledgeable priest identified it as a La Tour work and informed the Louvre, which entered negotiations to buy the painting. The art dealer Georges Wildenstein outbid the museum, however, purchasing the painting in 1949 for 7.5 million francs. For a decade it remained with the dealer, until in 1960 the Metropolitan Museum of Art paid an undisclosed but \\"very high sum of money\\"As quoted in Hagan et al., 74 for The Fortune Teller. How the painting had been able to leave France became a matter of controversy in the French press, and the writer Andr√© Malraux, then French Minister of Culture, attempted to explain to the National Assembly why the work did not end up in the Louvre. It later emerged that the export licence was signed by the art historian Germain Bazin, who was head of old master paintings at the Louvre; Wright speculates that he had sufficient doubt about the work not to want it for the Louvre.Wright, 49 Accusations of forgery The Fort Worth version of The Cheat The Louvre version of The Cheat La Tour was hardly known until the beginning of the 20th century, but became extremely highly regarded from the 1920s onwards. A large number of the paintings now attributed to La Tour have surfaced from obscurity, like the Metropolitan work, since he became well- known, and have become valuable. Many were in collections with a provenance going back to the 19th century or beyond, but others first appeared in the hands of dealers, and some have always been the subject of suspicion. The English art historian Christopher Wright published The Art of the Forger in 1984, a book whose central claim is that the Metropolitan Fortune Teller, along with other works attributed to La Tour, is actually a forgery of the 1920s by the artist and restorer Emile Delobre (1873‚Äì1956). The painting is clearly closely related to a work called The Cheat, which exists in two different versions: one in the Louvre (bought in 1972, for what was at the time the record price for a French painting),Wright, 85 and one in the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas. The Cheat shows a group playing cards, where a young dandy is being cheated, and shares the interest in costume of The Fortune Teller. After lengthy analysis of X-ray photographs, details of the costume, and stylistic comparisons with other works, Wright concludes that of the three, only the Fort Worth Cheat is genuine.Wright, chapter 6 compares the two Cheats Among his evidence is a claim that the word \\"MERDE\\" (French for \\"shit\\") could be seen in the lace collar of the young woman second from left. Anthony Blunt and others denied this, but in a letter of 1981 to The Burlington Magazine rebutting Wright's claims, two members of the Metropolitan curatorial staff accepted that the word was there, regarding it as the work of a recent restorer, and it was then removed in 1982.Wright, 67‚Äì68John M.

Wright points out that the subject is more probably 'The Procuress'. The central girl's dress parodies De la Tour's mother in \\"The Newborn\\" (Rennes), suggesting a satire more typical of 20th-century than 17th-century humour. Wright attributes the 'Fortune Teller' along with a Pseudo-Frans Hals (S. Francisco) to Emile-Victor-Augustin Delobre, whose self-portrait the latter appears to be.
