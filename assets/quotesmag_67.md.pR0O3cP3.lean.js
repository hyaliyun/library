It accounts for less than 1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It was first clearly characterized by F.M. Enzinger in 1970. It commonly presents itself in the distal limbs (fingers, hands, forearms, or feet) of young adults as a small, soft mass or a series of bumps. A proximal version has also been described, frequently occurring in the upper extremities. Rare cases have been reported in the pelvis, vulva, penis, and spine. Histologically, epithelioid sarcoma forms nodules with central necrosis surrounded by bland, polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and peripheral spindling. Epithelioid sarcomas typically express vimentin, cytokeratins, epithelial membrane antigen, and CD34, whereas they are usually negative for S100, desmin, and FLI1 (FLI-1). They typically stain positive for CA125. Epithelioid sarcoma most commonly strikes young adults, yet no age group is immune. The disease has a tendency to develop local recurrences and metastasis thereafter to regional lymph nodes, lung, bone, brain, and other locations, including the scalp. Generally speaking, epithelioid sarcoma has a high rate of relapse after initial treatment and tends to recur locally (at or near the original tumor site). Epithelioid sarcoma also demonstrates lymphatic spread (in 22-48% of cases), and metastasis (in 21-63% of cases). These events, as well as advanced stage (progression) and grade (aggressiveness), are predictive of an overall worse outcome. The overall five-year survival rate for epithelioid sarcoma is anywhere from 25 to 78%. Importantly, the 10-year and 15-year survival rate drops off significantly. Associated with a more positive outcome are younger age, female vs. male sex, distal vs. proximal location, smaller tumor size, and negative margins upon tumor resection. Signs and symptoms Epithelioid sarcoma is a slow-growing and relatively painless tumor, often resulting in a lengthy period of time between presentation and diagnosis. Due to its ambiguity, it is often misdiagnosed, mistaken as a persistent wart or cyst. It most commonly presents itself in the distal limbs (fingers, hands, forearms, or feet) as a small, soft mass or a series of bumps. It is most often described as a firm-to-hard palpable mass, either in the deep soft tissue or in the dermis. Often, ulcerate causing a mistaken diagnosis of a poorly healing traumatic wound or wart. About 13% of patients will present with multifocal tumors, and about 13% of patients will present with metastatic disease. Genetics The most common genetic mutation (found in 80-90% of epithelioid sarcomas) is the inactivation of the SMARCB1 gene, or the loss of INI-1 function, which is thought to be a major contributor to disease progression. Epithelioid sarcoma typically contains chromosome 22q11.2 mutations or deletions and 8q gains, particularly i(8) (>q10). Aberrations of 18q and 8q, as well as recurrent gains at 11q13, have also been observed. The SMARCB1 gene (also termed BAF47, INI1, or hSNF5) is located on chromosome 22q11.2 and codes for a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Loss of SMARCB1 function is the most common genetic mutation observed in epithelioid sarcoma, and this dysfunction is likely a major driver of disease progression. SMARCB1 is a core protein subunit of the 15 subunit SWI/SNF (or BAF) complex involved in regulating the nucleosome architecture of our genome and has been shown to be a potent tumor suppressor gene, meaning that its primary role is to control cell division and to even halt division under appropriate circumstances (i.e. signals to over-replicate). As this tumor suppressor is commonly inactivated in epithelioid sarcoma, cell division can fail to appropriately halt, resulting in unregulated cellular growth and the formation of cancer tumors. Several research teams are currently developing techniques to reverse this loss of genetic function characteristic of epithelioid sarcoma. Molecular biology=VEGF= VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) is often over-expressed in epithelioid sarcoma. This is a critical pathway in angiogenesis, a process that cancer cells use to form new blood vessels, which provide necessary elements to the tumor for tumor survival. Anti-VEGF agents such as pazopanib have shown promise across several different carcinomas and in soft tissue sarcomas. In one case study, a patient with advanced metastatic vulvar epithelioid sarcoma showed a partial resolution of both lung and pleural metastases when pazopanib was administered, whereas all other therapies had failed =MET= MET (mesenchymal to epithelial transition) is another biological pathway that is likely involved in the development and progression of epithelioid sarcoma. c-MET is a tyrosine kinase oncogene, and its signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of malignancies, including many cancers. =Sonic hedgehog and Notch= The Sonic hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways are also suspected to be up-regulated in epithelioid sarcoma. These cell signaling pathways control cellular proliferation and differentiation. They are also involved in cancer stem cell coordination and disease invasiveness and metastasis. Hhat inhibitors (such as RU-SKI 43) block the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway by inhibiting hedgehog palmitoyl acytl-transferase. Current trials are investigating Notch inhibitors against epithelioid sarcoma. =mTOR= The frequent hyperactivation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling has also been observed in epithelioid sarcoma. The mTOR pathway has been described as a “master switch” for cellular catabolism and anabolism, and it can enhance cell cycle progression, cell survival, and block normal cell death (apoptosis). It has been demonstrated that simply blocking mTOR signaling can result in the reactivation of the AKT pathway, negating much of the anti-mTOR's efficacy. This reactivation of AKT has been shown to be c-MET-dependent, resulting in the rationale that blocking both mTOR and c-MET concurrently would show increased efficacy. =EGFR= The over- expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported in a majority of epithelioid sarcomas. EGFR is a member of the HER receptor family. Upon ligand binding, EGFR phosphorylation triggers the activation of downstream signaling pathways involved in critical cellular functions such as proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. In-vitro and in-vivo laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the blockade of EGFR in epithelioid sarcoma results in decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and abrogated invasion and migration capacities. While the simple blockade of EGFR with a single agent has shown limited results in the clinical setting, when used as part of a combination regime (where an EGFR inhibitor is combined with an mTOR inhibitor), a synergism has been observed, and superior tumor growth inhibition has been demonstrated. =CD109= CD109 is often expressed in advanced epithelioid sarcoma and is thought to mark the cancer stem cell (or cancer initiating cell) of the disease. Its level of expression has also been shown to be predictive of outcome. Cancer stem cells are a small population of tumor cells characterized by general chemo-resistance, the ability to self- renew, multi-differentiation potential, dormancy capabilities, and tumorigenesis. Therefore, cancer stem cells are thought to play key roles in the progression and relapse of cancer. =Cyclin D1= Cyclin D1 is a protein requisite for cell cycle progression and has been shown to be up-regulated in epithelioid sarcoma. Cyclin D-1 is a regulator of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6). It has been shown to interact with the retinoblastoma protein (a tumor suppressor gene), CDK4 and CDK6, thyroid hormone receptor beta, and nuclear receptor coactivator 1, among others. Cyclin D and CDKs promote cell cycle progression by releasing transcription factors that are important for the initiation of DNA replication. Abnormal levels of cyclin D-1 may promote rapid cell division in epithelioid sarcoma. Diagnosis Tissue biopsy is the diagnostic modality of choice. Due to a high incidence of lymph node involvement, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is often performed. A common characteristic of epithelioid sarcoma (observed in 80% of all cases) is the loss of function of the SMARCB1 gene (also termed BAF47, INI1, or hSNF5). Immunohistochemical staining of INI1 is available and can be used for the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma. MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice for imaging prior to biopsy and pathologic diagnosis, with the primary role being the determination of anatomic boundaries. =Staging= The staging for epithelioid sarcoma takes into account size and location of the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, presence and location of metastasis, and histologic grade (a measure of disease aggressiveness) Treatment Surgical resection of the tumor with wide margins remains the preferred method of treatment, and has shown the most success against the disease. Recently, limb-sparing surgery has been explored with moderate success. In cases of advanced, recurrent, or metastasized disease, or if the tumor is inoperable, chemotherapy and radiation are the standard of care, although the overall success rates with these remains low. In January 2020, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Tazverik (tazemetostat), a compound that blocks the EZH2 methyltransferase for the treatment epithelioid sarcoma in patients aged 16 years and older with either metastatic or locally advanced (unable to be completely removed surgically) disease. Prognosis The 5-year survival rate for epithelioid sarcoma patients is 50-70%, and the 10-year survival rate is 42-55%. Children with epithelioid sarcoma tend to have slightly better outcomes than adults, with 5 year survival rates around 65%. Pediatric patients also tend to display less lymphatic spread and metastasis. In addition to stage and grade of the tumor, gender, site, age at diagnosis, tumor size and microscopic pathology have all been shown to affect prognosis. Advanced stage and grade are associated with worse outcomes. Females tend to have more favorable outcomes than males, proximal cases show worse outcomes than distal cases, and younger age is associated with more positive outcomes. Tumors more than 2 cm in diameter and tumors with necrosis and vascular invasion have been correlated with a worse outcome. The gold standard for chemotherapy is a combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide. However, recent studies have suggested that the addition of ifosfamide to doxorubicin does not necessarily lead to an increase in overall survival. Etoposide, vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide have also traditionally been given. Newer chemotherapies, such as gemcitabine and pazopanib, are currently being tested in clinical trials. Radiation therapy is also a treatment option when tumors are deemed inoperable or wide surgical margins are not achievable. Radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy has so far resulted in only minimal improvements to response rates. Trials with brachytherapy (an internal radiation treatment that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and is thought to have fewer long-term side effects) have produced some positive results. Research Epithelioid sarcoma (especially advanced stage, recurrent, or metastasized disease) has been shown to be resistant to traditional cancer therapies, necessitating further exploration of novel treatment methods and techniques. Because of the relatively poor response of epithelioid sarcoma to traditional cancer treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation), new treatment strategies are being looked to. =Chemotherapy= New chemotherapies are being explored in current clinical trials for epithelioid sarcoma, although, thus far, none has shown significant improvement over the efficacy of doxorubicin/ifosfamide. These new agents include gemcitabine, pazopanib, cixutumumab, temozolomide, dasatanib, bevacizumab, taxanes, and vinorelbine. Aldoxorubicin is a new pro-drug of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is the standard of care for advanced or metastic epithelioid sarcoma, but has dose-limiting toxicities, namely acute and chronic cardiac toxicity. Doxorubicin has achieved response rates in the 12-23% range for patients with soft tissue sarcomas. Aldoxorubicin is a new version of doxorubicin that is designed to safely deliver a higher dose of the drug directly to the tumor, resulting in increased efficacy and less toxicity. It works by entering the bloodstream, binding to the albumin in the blood, traveling throughout the body, and releasing a doxorubicin payload when it encounters the acidic microenvironment of a tumor. Several phase I and II studies are ongoing, and, thus far at least, little if any cardiac toxicity has been observed. A maximum tolerated dose of aldoxorubicin has been established at 3.5 times the MTD of doxorubicin, and studies have indicated increased response rates for patients with soft tissue sarcomas. What is unknown at this time are the potential long-term side-effects of this increased dose of doxorubicin. Several studies have shown increased risk of the development of secondary cancers associated with exposure to high-dose anthracyclines (such as doxorubicin). TH-302 is another novel prodrug in current development. It targets tumor hypoxia, a common event in tumorigenesis where the tumor microenvironment is depleted of oxygen and becomes hypoxic. Hypoxic niches in tumors tend to harbor slower-growing cancer cells, making many chemotherapies ineffective in these areas. TH-302 directly targets these deep hypoxic regions, and once within them, it releases a cytotoxic payload of bromo-isophosphoramide mustard directly to the cancer cells. Given that epithelioid sarcoma is a slow-growing tumor, it is reasonable to hypothesize that ES tumors would be highly hypoxic and show a favorable response to TH-302. Several studies have observed increased efficacy of TH-302 when the hypoxic tumor microenvironment has been exasperated. Several phase I, II, and III trials with TH-302 and TH-302 in combination with doxorubicin are ongoing, and promising results have thus far been observed. Two phase 3 trials failed in 2015. =Immunotherapies= Immunotherapy is the strategy of using the body's own immune system to fight cancer. It usually involves “training” or “tweaking” the immune system so that it can better recognize and reject cancer cells. Different immunotherapies can include manipulation of the body's T-cells, NK cells, or Dendritic cells so they are more effective against cancer cells. They can also include the administration of laboratory-produced antibodies specific to tumor antigens to create or boost an immune response. Vaccine therapy is perhaps the immunotherapeutic strategy with the most ongoing exploration in sarcomas at the current time, although, thus far at least, little evidence has emerged indicating that active vaccination alone can lead to tumor regression. Multiple techniques and treatment strategies are currently being studied in an effort to improve the objective response rate of vaccine therapy. Vaccines can deliver various tumor-associated factors (tumor antigens) to the immune system, resulting in a natural antibody and T-cell response to the tumor. Adoptive immunotherapy seeks to expand a population of the body's T-cells that will recognize a specific tumor antigen. T-cells can be harvested and then expanded and genetically manipulated to recognize certain tumor markers. In one case, a patient with advanced epithelioid sarcoma who had failed multiple therapies showed a strong response to expanded lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently shown promise against several cancers and may hold promise against sarcomas as well. Tumors often evolve during disease progression, and they can develop an expression of inhibitory proteins that deter recognition by the immune system and allow the tumor to escape immune surveillance. By targeting these inhibitory proteins, a pathway is opened for the immune system to recognize the tumor. Two of these inhibitory proteins that have been studied recently are CTLA-4 and PD1, and drugs targeting these proteins are in development and showing some promise. =Anti-angiogenic therapies= Several anti-angiogenic agents are being explored in epithelioid sarcoma, a cancer that likely relies on angiogenesis for survival and progression. These agents interfere with various pro-angiogenic factors, several of which are known to be over-expressed in epithelioid sarcoma (VEGF and EGFR for example). Tumors require a blood supply to provide them with oxygen and nutrients necessary for their survival. As tumors expand and grow, they send out various signals (such as HIF1) that encourage new blood vessel development to the tumor. Anti- angiogenic agents, such as bevacizumab, attempt to slow or block the growth of tumors by essentially cutting off their blood supply. =Targeted therapies= Given the multiple genetic abnormalities and disrupted biological pathways observed in epithelioid sarcoma, drugs targeting these unique tumor characteristics are being looked at for more effective treatments. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as sunitinib, pazopanib, and dasatinib) have shown some effect against several cancer types, most notably Imatinib-mesylate in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Tyrosine kinase (a subclass of protein kinases) is an enzyme that transfers a phosphate group from an ATP molecule to a protein in a cell. It functions as an “on” or “off” switch for many cellular functions, including signaling within the cell, and cell division. Tyrosine kinases can contain mutations that cause them to become constitutively active, or stuck in the “on” position, resulting in unregulated cell division (a hallmark of cancer). Tyrosine kinase Inhibitors block the action of these enzymes. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit the VEGF, EGFR, and MET, pathways that are frequently over-expressed in epithelioid sarcoma. They also can be used against the c-KIT and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, which are involved in many cancers and may be involved in epithelioid sarcoma. Temsirolimus is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the effects of the mTOR protein and inhibits the mTOR pathway. Because of crosstalk between cell signaling pathways, it has been shown that, while interfering with the mTOR pathway alone produces only limited results in halting tumorigenesis, inhibiting both the mTOR and the EGFR pathways concurrently shows an increased effect. SINE Selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) compounds, such as selinexor and CBS9106, are being investigated in several sarcomas and have recently shown promising results across a broad spectrum of both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. These compounds work by blocking the export of tumor suppressor genes from the cell's nucleus to the cell's cytoplasm, where they are rendered nonfunctional. Exportin 1 (a.k.a. XPO1 or CRM1) is a nuclear export protein responsible for the export of over 200 proteins, including the vast majority of tumor suppressor proteins. For tumor suppressor genes to carry out their normal function (appropriately initiating apoptosis), they must be located in the nucleus of the cell. Many cancer cells have been shown to express high levels of exportin1, resulting in the increased export of tumor suppressor proteins out of the nucleus and therefore counteracting the natural apoptic processes that protect the body from cancer. SINE compounds prevent the transport of these tumor suppressor proteins out of the nucleus, allowing them to function normally and encourage apoptosis. Recently, researchers have observed a synergistic effect when using SINE compounds in combination with traditional chemotherapies (such as doxorubicin). It has been demonstrated that a loss of INI1 expression can result in the “unmasking” of a nuclear export signal, resulting in the transport of tumor suppressor proteins out of the nucleus of the cell, thus favoring tumorigenesis. It is therefore reasonable to suspect that a SINE inhibitor would show efficacy against epithelioid sarcoma, as the disease is characterized by a loss of INI1 function. HDAC inhibitors Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as vorinostat, have shown some promise in epithelioid sarcoma. Researchers in Texas are investigating whether or not HDAC inhibitors can reverse the loss of INI1 function that is characteristic of epithelioid sarcoma. HDAC inhibitors work by blocking events involved in DNA replication and, therefore, in cell division. Blocking HDAC has been shown to encourage cancer cells to enter apoptosis. Several dietary phytochemicals have been shown to be effective HDAC inhibitors. These include sulphorphane, indole-3-carbinol, and phenethyl isothiocyanates, found in broccoli, kale, and watercress, and epigallocatecehin-3-gallate, found in green tea. CDK inhibitors Because of the association (see above) with cyclin D1 CDK inhibitors are being studied. palbociclib is a CDK inhibitor (approved for some breast cancer). Other experimental CDK inhibitors include abemaciclib and ribociclib. =Targeting the cancer stem cell= Cancer stem cells (or cancer-initiating cells) are thought to be a small population of cells within the tumor that are directly responsible for tumor formation. They are thought to be resistant to treatment and to have the ability to form all the cells needed for tumor development. They are suspected to be a major contributing factor in cancer progression and relapse after treatment. Certain “stem-like” cells have been found in epithelioid sarcoma that are marked by CD109 (cluster of differentiation 109), providing a potentially drug-able target on the cancer stem cell for the disease. Certain challenges to targeting CD109 do exist, however, as CD109 is expressed in other areas of the body and not only in tumor cells. =Oncolytic viral therapy= Oncolytic viral therapy is an emerging cancer therapy that attempts to infect cancer cells with a genetically engineered virus that can penetrate the DNA of the cell. The virus then 1.) does direct damage to the cancer cell, 2.) is spread throughout the cells of the tumor via cellular (DNA) multiplication (tumor cell division and replication), and 3.) provides a target for a direct immune response from the patient. It has been noted that the therapeutic potential of oncolytic virotherapy is not a simple consequence of the cytopathic effect but strongly relies on the induction of an endogenous immune response against transformed cells. Superior anticancer effects have been observed when oncolytic viruses are engineered to express (or be co-administered with) immunostimulatory molecules such as GM-CSF. Telomelysin (OBP-301) is an adenovirus that targets telomerase, an enzyme that is expressed in practically all cancer cells but not in normal cells. OBP-301 has been studied in epithelioid sarcoma and shown to promote apoptosis and cell death [. CGTG-102 CGTG-102 (developed by Oncos Therapeutics) is an adenovirus currently in orphan drug status for soft tissue sarcomas. It is modified to selectively replicate in p16/Rb-defective cells, which include most human cancer cells. In addition, CGTG-102 codes for the granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a potent immunostimulatory molecule. While the CGTG-102 oncolytic adenovirus has shown efficacy as a single agent against several soft tissue sarcomas, it would also be appealing to use in combination with other regimes, as oncolytic viruses have demonstrated very little overlap in side effects with traditional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation. CGTG-102 has recently been studied in combination with doxorubicin, and a synergistic effect was observed. At least part of doxorubicin's mechanism of action is as an inducer of immunogenic cell death, and it has been suggested that immune response contributes to its overall anti-tumor activity. Doxorubicin has been shown to increase adenoviral replication in soft tissue sarcoma cells as well, potentially contributing to the observed synergistic effect in the virus/doxorubicin combination.

According to a primary source Rajavaliya, he killed the grand son of Parakrama Bahu VI namely Vira Parakrama Bahu or Jaya Bahu (1468 – c. 1470) but Do Couto, however, who was well-informed, says after a few years' reign the king died and his half-witted son was put on the throne by his aunt, who two years later finding herself unable to rule sent for Sapumal Kumaraya from Jaffna. Origins theories There are number of theories as to his ethnic origin and the reason for the rebellion against his rule. According to John Holt he was an ethnic Tamil from the Eastern part of the Island, whereas other sources mention that he may have come from the Malabar region, Tulunadu or the Coromandel Coast. He has also been identified to be adopted by Parakramabahu VI after the death of his father Manikka Thalaivan, a Karaiyar chief, who was killed in a battle mentioned in the manuscript Mukkara Hatana.A. Sebastian, A Complete Illustrated History of Sri Lanka. Vijitha Yapa Publications, 2012. p 397. He is credited to have built the Nallur Kandaswamy temple in Jaffna as well as other Temples and Buddhist Vihares in the South. The rebellion against his is seen as a reflection of ethnic Sinhalese identity against a perceived outsider. Conquest of Jaffna Kingdom The conquest of the Jaffna Kingdom took place in many stages. Firstly, the tributaries to the Jaffna Kingdom in the Vanni area, namely the Vanniar chieftains of the Vannimai were neutralised. This was followed by two successive invasions. The first invasion did not succeed in capturing the kingdom. It was the second invasion dated to 1450 that eventually was successful. Apparently connected with this war of conquest was an expedition to Adriampet in modern South India, occasioned according to Valentyn by the seizure of a Lankan ship laden with cinnamon. The Tenkasi inscription of Arikesari Parakrama Pandya of Tinnevelly 'who saw the backs of kings at Singai, Anurai,' and else where, may refer to these wars; it is dated between A.D. 1449–50 and 1453-4.Humphrey William Codrington, A Short History of Ceylon Ayer Publishing, 1970; Kanakasooriya Cinkaiariyan the Aryacakravarti king fled to South India with his family.

The movement grew quickly in popularity as it espoused the causes of India's farmers and labourers against the zamindars, princely class and landed gentry. Socialism shaped the principal economic and social policies of the Indian government but mostly followed Dirigism after independence until the early 1990s, when India moved towards a more market-based economy. However, it remains a potent influence on Indian politics, with many national and regional political parties espousing democratic socialism. Small socialist revolutionary groups arose in India in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. The Communist Party of India was established in 1921, but socialism as an ideology gained a nationwide appeal after it was endorsed by leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru. Socialists were amongst the first to call for outright Indian independence from Britain. Under Nehru, the Indian National Congress, India's largest political party, adopted socialism as an ideology for socio-economic policies in 1936. Socialists and communists also engineered the Tebhaga movement of farmers in Bengal against the landed gentry. However, mainstream Indian socialism connected itself with Gandhism and adopted peaceful struggle instead of class warfare. After India's independence in 1947, the Indian government under prime ministers Nehru and Indira Gandhi oversaw land reform and the nationalisation of major industries and the banking sector. Independently, activists Vinoba Bhave and Jayaprakash Narayan worked for peaceful land redistribution under the Sarvodaya movement, where landlords granted land to farm workers out of their own free will. In the 1960s, the Communist Party of India formed India's first democratically elected communist government when it won elections in the states of Kerala and later West Bengal. However, when a global recession began in the late 1970s, economic stagnation, chronic shortages and state inefficiency left many disillusioned with state socialism. In the late 1980s and 1990s, India's government began to systematically liberalise the Indian economy by pursuing privatisation, aiming to attract foreign investment. History The socialist movement began to develop in India with the Russian Revolution. However, in 1871 a group in Calcutta had contacted Karl Marx with the purpose of organizing an Indian section of the First International.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 103 The first article in an Indian publication (in English) that mentions the names of Marx & Engels printed in the Modern Review in March 1912. The short biographical article titled Karl Marx – a modern Rishi was written by the German-based Indian revolutionary Lala Har Dayal.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 82, 103 The first biography of Karl Marx in an Indian language was written by R. Rama Krishna Pillai in 1914.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 82 Marxism made a major impact in Indian media at the time of the Russian Revolution. Of particular interest to many Indian papers and magazines was the Bolshevik policy of right to self-determination of all nations. Bipin Chandra Pal and Bal Gangadhar Tilak were amongst the prominent Indians who expressed their admiration of Lenin and the new rulers in Russia. Abdul Sattar Khairi and Abdul Zabbar Khairi went to Moscow, immediately on hearing about the revolution. In Moscow, they met Lenin and conveyed their greetings to him. The Russian Revolution also affected émigré Indian revolutionaries, such as the Ghadar Party in North America. The Khilafat movement contributed to the emergence of early Indian communism. Many Indian Muslims left India to join the defence of the Caliphate. Several of them became communists whilst visiting Soviet territory. Some Hindus also joined the Muslim muhajirs in the travels to the Soviet areas.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 83 The colonial authorities were clearly disturbed by the growing influence of Bolshevik sympathies in India. A first counter-move was the issuing of a fatwa, urging Muslims to reject communism. The Home Department established a special branch to monitor the communist influence. Customs were ordered to check the imports of Marxist literature to India. A great number of anti-communist propaganda publications were published.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 82-83 The First World War was accompanied with a rapid increase of industries in India, resulting in a growth of an industrial proletariat. At the same time prices of essential commodities increased. These were factors that contributed to the buildup of the Indian trade union movement. Unions were formed in the urban centres across India, and strikes were organised. In 1920, the All India Trade Union Congress was founded.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 83-84 One Indian impressed with developments in Russia was S. A. Dange in Bombay. In 1921, he published a pamphlet titled Gandhi Vs. Lenin, a comparative study of the approaches of both the leaders with Lenin coming out as better of the two. Together with Ranchoddas Bhavan Lotvala, a local mill-owner, a library of Marxist Literature was set up and publishing of translations of Marxist classics began.Riepe, Dale. Marxism in India in Parsons, Howard Lee and Sommerville, John (ed.) Marxism, Revolution and Peace. Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1977. p. 41. In 1922, with Lotvala's help, Dange launched the English weekly, Socialist, the first Indian Marxist journal.Sen, Mohit. The Dange Centenary in Banerjee, Gopal (ed.) S.A. Dange – A Fruitful Life. Kolkata: Progressive Publishers, 2002. p. 43. Regarding the political situation in the colonised world, the 1920 second congress of the Communist International insisted that a united front should be formed between the proletariat, peasantry and national bourgeoisie in the colonised countries. Among the twenty-one conditions drafted by Lenin ahead of the congress was the 11th thesis, which stipulated that all communist parties must support the bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in the colonies. Some of the delegates opposed the idea of alliance with the bourgeoisie, and preferred support to communist movements of these countries instead. Their criticism was shared by the Indian revolutionary M.N. Roy, who attended as a delegate of the Communist Party of Mexico. The congress removed the term 'bourgeois-democratic' in what became the 8th condition.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 48, 84–85 A Communist Group was founded in Tashkent on 17 October 1920, soon after the Second Congress of the Communist International by M.N. Roy. Roy made contacts with Anushilan and Jugantar groups in Bengal. Small communist groups were formed in Bengal (led by Muzaffar Ahmed), Bombay (led by S.A. Dange), Madras (led by Singaravelu Chettiar), United Provinces (led by Shaukat Usmani) and Punjab (led by Ghulam Hussain).M.V.S. Koteswara Rao. Communist Parties and United Front – Experience in Kerala and West Bengal. Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 89 On 1 May 1923 the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan was founded in Madras, by Singaravelu Chettiar. The LKPH organised the first May Day celebration in India, and this was also the first time the red flag was used in India.:: Singaravelar – Achievements :: M.V.S. Koteswara Rao.

Ghate was the first General Secretary of CPI. The conference held on 1925 December 25 to 28. Colonial authorities estimated that 500 persons took part in the conference. The conference was convened by a man called Satyabhakta, of whom little is known. Satyabhakta is said to have argued for a ‘national communism’ and against subordination under Comintern. Being outvoted by the other delegates, Satyabhakta left both the conference venue in protest.Satyabhakta then formed a party called National Communist Party, which lasted until 1927. The conference adopted the name ‘Communist Party of India’. Groups such as LKPH dissolved into the unified CPI.M.V.S. Koteswara Rao.

Hyderabad: Prajasakti Book House, 2003. p. 92-93 The émigré CPI, which probably had little organic character anyway, was effectively substituted by the organisation now operating inside India. Communist electoral mural in Jadavpur. Currently, Marxism is especially prevalent in Kerala, West Bengal and Tripura. The two largest Communist parties in Indian politics are the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Communist Party of India. The Revolutionary Socialist Party and All India Forward Bloc support them in some states. These four parties constitute the Left Democratic Front. There are many smaller Marxist parties, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), Marxist Communist Party of India, Marxist Coordination Committee in Jharkhand, Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy, Communist Marxist Party and BTR-EMS-AKG Janakeeya Vedi in Kerala, Mazdoor Mukti (Workers' Emancipation) and Party of Democratic Socialism in West Bengal, Janganotantrik Morcha in Tripura, the Ram Pasla group in Punjab, and the Orissa Communist Party in Orissa. Political parties At the 1931 Karachi session of the Indian National Congress, socialist pattern of development was set as the goal for India. Through the 1955 Avadi Resolution of the Indian National Congress, a socialistic pattern of development was presented as the goal of the party. A year later, the Indian parliament adopted 'socialistic pattern of development' as official policy, a policy that came to include land reforms and regulations of industries. The word socialist was added to the Preamble of the Indian Constitution by the 42nd amendment act of 1976, during the Emergency. It implies social and economic equality. Social equality in this context means the absence of discrimination on the grounds only of caste, colour, creed, sex, religion, or language. Under social equality, everyone has equal status and opportunities. Economic equality in this context means that the government will endeavour to make the distribution of wealth more equal and provide a decent standard of living for all. Following independence, the Indian government officially adopted a policy of non-alignment, although it had an affinity with the USSR. The party's commitment to socialism has waned in recent years, particularly following the assassination of Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi. Elected in 1991, the government of Narasimha Rao introduced economic liberalisation with the support of finance minister Manmohan Singh, who later on became the prime minister of India (2004-2014). Communists were also active in the Indian independence movement and have played a significant role in India's political life, although they are fragmented into a multitude of different parties. Communist parties represented in parliament are: (statistics from 2004 General Elections) Communist Party of India (Marxist) (43 seats in the Lok Sabha), the Communist Party of India (10 seats), the Revolutionary Socialist Party (three seats) and the All India Forward Bloc (three seats). The former speaker of the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee, is a member of the CPI(M). Left Front parties remain an independent faction in the parliament critical of the policies of both the government and that of the mainstream opposition parties. Aside from the Congress and the Left Front, there are other socialist parties active in India, notably the Samajwadi Party, which emerged from the Janata Dal, formed by Mulayam Singh Yadav, former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and Union Defence Minister and now led by his son Akhilesh Yadav, also a former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. It has 5 seats in the 16th Lok Sabha. Noted Indian socialists include the founding leader of the All India Forward Bloc and the Indian National Army Subhas Chandra Bose and the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

The property is managed by the Brandywine River Museum, which offers tours. It was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1997. and Description and history The Wyeth House and Studio are located in a rural-residential area southeast of the village center of Chadds Ford, on the south side of Murphy Road. Set on about of land are the main house, art studio, barn, and pump house. The property is bounded on the north by Murphy Road and the south by Brandywine Creek. The house is set on a ridge that is part of the Brandywine Battlefield area, having been occupied by Continental Army troops during the 1777 Battle of Brandywine. The house is a two-story Colonial Revival structure, designed for Wyeth by William Draper Brinkle and built in 1911. It was enlarged in 1926 to provide additional space for Wyeth's growing family. The studio is a large L-shaped single-story structure, built in stages in 1911, 1923, and 1931. The main studio space is distinguished by a large north-facing Palladian window. N.C. Wyeth was renowned as one of the leading illustrators of the first half of the 20th century, his works appearing in Harper's, Scribner's, McClure's, and the Saturday Evening Post. Wyeth drew much inspiration from the landscape around this property, which influenced many of his rural landscape works. He purchased this property with funds made from his first major commission, a series of illustrations for an edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. After Wyeth died in 1945, his wife lived in the house until 1973, after which their daughter, Carolyn Wyeth, lived there and painted in the studio until her death in 1994.

Bloss (April 4, 1859 – June 22, 1921) was the first American football coach at Oregon State University in 1893 and again in 1897. He also was the quarterback of the 1893 team. Early life Bloss was the son of John McKnight Bloss, a Civil War veteran and president of State Agricultural College (now Oregon State University) from 1892 to 1896. Bloss attended Indiana University where he was a star player on the football team. Bloss moved to Corvallis, Oregon shortly after his father did in June 1892. Coaching career Oregon State's first season of football was in 1893. At that time, Oregon State was known as Oregon Agricultural College, or OAC. William H. Bloss became the school's first coach, as well as the quarterback of the 1893 team. Bloss scheduled tryouts in the fall of 1893 in an attempt to assemble a football team. By mid-October, he had found 17 players that would make up the first football team in Oregon State's history. The team was a hodge podge of young men in Corvallis. Four players were not even students, including Coach Bloss. One was a high school junior and another was a faculty member. The first game was played on November 11, 1893 at 2:00pm at College Field on Lower Campus against Albany College. Over 500 spectators who paid a dime admission cheered on SAC to 62–0 win, a blowout by today's standards but even worse considering touchdowns were only worth four points at the time. Brady F. Burnett scored Oregon State's first touchdown in school history on a fumble return for a touchdown. In that first season, SAC went on to a 5–1 record. Bloss left Corvallis after that first season, but returned to coach the 1897 season. He did not quarterback the team. He led SAC to a 5–0 season, including victories over Oregon and Washington.

The sequel to 2006's Just Cause, it was powered by Avalanche Studios' Avalanche 2.0 Engine. It features Rico Rodriguez, a major operative of the fictional Agency who arrives at Panau (a fictional dystopian island nation in Maritime Southeast Asia) to overthrow dictator Pandak \\"Baby\\" Panay and confront former mentor Tom Sheldon. The gameplay involves Rico fighting hostile militants with guns and a grappling hook, enabling players to tether objects to each other and slingshot into the air with a parachute. Just Cause 2 introduces the Chaos System, in which players must complete missions and destroy government property on Panau for Chaos points. These points are essential for story progression. The game was developed as an improvement of Just Cause; its team saw missed opportunities in the first game, analyzing and refining it. As a result, mission design, artificial intelligence and most core gameplay mechanics were overhauled. Panau, inspired by Southeast Asia, was considered by the team a good location for an action game. Avalanche Studios worked with Square Enix London Studios while developing Just Cause 2. It was announced in 2007 with a demo attracting two million players. Just Cause 2 received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, open-ended nature, stunts, world design, and graphics while criticizing its story, gunplay, and mission design. Sales of six million copies worldwide exceeded original projections. The game was supported with downloadable content at release, and a multiplayer fan project was eventually approved as an add-on. A sequel, Just Cause 3, was released in late 2015. Gameplay Screenshot of Rico Rodriguez grappling under a helicopter while receiving Chaos points by destroying government property Just Cause 2 is a third-person action-adventure game in which players control Rico Rodriguez, field operative of the Agency, in an effort to overthrow the island dictatorship of Panau: an open world for players to explore. The game has three types of missions. Agency missions advance the story and are the game's main campaign; faction missions task players to assist the game's three factions, and stronghold missions task players to infiltrate government bases and liberate them for the factions. To advance through the campaign missions a player must earn chaos points, a progression system introduced in the game. Players earn chaos points for completing missions and destroying designated government property. As the number of chaos points increases, the factions gain influence and the government begins to collapse. In addition to typical missions, Just Cause 2 has race challenges which give players cash. The game's open world is free for players to explore when they are not on missions. Panau is described as an area of about . There are a variety of landscapes, including deserts, mountains and jungles, and over three hundred settlements. The settlements contain government properties, which can be destroyed, and unlockables such as cash stashes and weapon, vehicle and armor parts. Finding all the collectibles and destroying all the government properties will help players liberate a settlement and receive chaos points. When players create chaos or enter restricted areas, they generate heat noticed by hostile government militants; the heat decreases when the player evades them. The map is Rico's PDA, with points of interest including mission locations, settlements, military outposts, race challenges and the player's progress. Waypoints may be set on the PDA. Players can use a variety of weapons to fight enemies. The game features a large arsenal of weapons, from two-handed pistols to rocket launchers, and a variety of sea, land and air vehicles. Players can drive them, jump on top of them or hide in front of them while they are moving and hijack enemy vehicles, triggering a series of quick-time events. Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, they encounter a black market supplier from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased (with optional delivery to the player's location by helicopter). As more chaos points are gained, additional weapons, vehicles and an extraction option become available on the black market. All black-market weapons and vehicles can be upgraded in steps with weapon and vehicle components in the game world; over 2,000 parts may be acquired. Players use a beacon to access the market. Just Cause 2 includes a grappling hook enabling players to tether objects together. In a high-speed vehicle chase a player can use the grappling hook to attach the pursuit vehicle to the ground, forcing it to stop and often damaging it by flipping. Players can also tether two enemies together. The grappling hook allows a player to pull himself, hold onto objects such as walls or helicopters and pull enemies towards Rico. The player has a parachute, which is always ready to be deployed even if it was already deployed moments earlier. This can be combined with the grappling hook as quick transport, with players \\"slingshooting\\" themselves into the air. Plot Four years after Just Cause, Rico Rodriguez is dropped into Panau to find his former handler Tom Sheldon, who is suspected of going rogue and aligning himself with the country's dictator Pandak \\"Baby\\" Panay. With the aid of intelligence asset Karl Blaine and a weapons dealer only known as the Sloth Demon, Rico allies with the island's three dominant criminal gangs and factions: the Roaches (an organized crime syndicate), the Reapers (an insurgent socialist militia) and the Ular Boys, an ultranationalist rebel group which espouses traditionalism and opposes foreign influence.Karl Blaine, after Casino Bust mission: \\"The Roaches are Panau's Urban Mob.- -The Reapers, well, they follow in good old Che Guevara's footsteps.- -Then there's the Ular boys: a crazy jungle mob who plan to turn this island into a natural paradise. Meaning: no foreigners, no foreign goods or foreign pop music, dig?\\" Rico gathers enough information to track down Sheldon, who reveals that he has been the Sloth Demon while he was investigating a greater conspiracy behind Panay's rise to power. Rico determines that Sheldon has not gone rogue, and Sheldon tells him to continue causing chaos on Panau while he explains the situation to the Agency. Sheldon then tells Rico to hurry to his hideout, where Rico learns that intelligence asset Jade Tan has been captured in Panay's military base and will be tortured and—possibly-summarily executed. Although Rico rescues her and destroys the base, Jade is bundled into a truck and a fleet of gunmen try to escape along a frozen lake. A nuclear submarine emerges from the ice, but Rico hijacks the truck and they are airlifted to safety by Kane (Sheldon and Rico's mission handler). Jade later explains that the Roaches, Reapers, and Ular Boys are secretly backed by Russia, China, and Japan, respectively, to bring down Baby Panay, but Rico and Sheldon wonder what the small island has which is so attractive to superpowers. They track down and assassinate the foreign intelligence officers liaising with the factions. Soon afterwards, the island is engulfed in so much chaos that Panay leaves the capital for his fortified military base. Rico assaults the base with the aid of a faction of his choosing. Panay is apparently killed during the assault by Karl Blaine in a murder-suicide, but not before Panay explains that the three nations, along with the United States, have been interested in Panau for its oil reserves, supposedly the largest in the world. With Panay dead, the situation in Panau becomes a free-for-all as foreign nations scramble to claim the oil. Russia, China and Japan send a fleet of supertankers to Panau, and the U.S. begins scrambling its military forces to defend the island. Rico is tasked with holding off the supertankers until reinforcements arrive, but a nuclear submarine suddenly surfaces. Rico investigates the submarine and finds Panay, alive but injured. Although Panay fires nuclear missiles at Russia, China, Japan and the U.S., his clothing snags on one of the missiles and he goes up with it. In pursuit, Rico grapples onto the missile; the men battle in midair as he disarms each missile. Finally, Rico pins Panay to the exposed core of the U.S.-bound missile, and reprograms the targeting computer before jumping to safety. The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed at the loss of billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not go to war and the island's residents will be spared. Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done. Development Just Cause 2 was developed by the Swedish Avalanche Studios, with Square Enix London Studios providing additional support. The game's predecessor, Just Cause, was a moderate commercial success and received mixed reviews from critics. The team thought that although it had potential, it was an opportunity missed and described Just Cause 2 as a \\"sequel waiting to be made\\". Shortly after the start of development, the team begin analyzing the first game's strengths and weaknesses with the intention of improving it. They wanted to use the large open world to create rewarding quests and missions, dropping the first game's side missions in favor of faction missions, stronghold takeovers and race challenges to increase gameplay density (keeping players occupied, even when simply exploring the world). This density increased the connectivity between the faction and Agency missions. Another goal was to improve the game's combat and artificial intelligence, so action stunts would be easier to perform and the game's tactical element would increase. The team overhauled the artificial intelligence, improving enemy characters' reaction to player action and their environment. The game features a Hybrid Locking System, which make aiming easier, and a real-time destruction system. The team refined the game's driving mechanics to make them feel more realistic. They said that its \\"over- the-top\\" action and emphasis on player freedom would distinguish Just Cause 2 from other open world games. According to Peter Johansson, many gameplay mechanics were so \\"crazy\\" that they hesitated when testing the game; they were included in the final product because it was thought that they would make the game fun to play, meeting the franchise's main goal of performing many stunts in a massive open world. Since Just Cause grappling hook was praised, the team made it more accessible and easier to use as an essential part of the sequel's combat system. The team also refined the parachute, making it more realistic and giving players more control of its movement. They added the Chaos system, enhancing player freedom by allowing them to progress through the game in a number of ways instead of completing missions. The game is set in Panau, described as an island with a variety of landscapes and cultures (including Japan, Thailand and the Malay Archipelago). The team chose the setting because they considered that its exoticism suited an action game. Hawaii and New Zealand also inspired the game world. Although the game's plot was unconnected to Just Cause, it featured a more-experienced Rico as the protagonist. According to game director Magnus Nedfors, the team retained the first game's \\"campy\\" tone. The narrative remained light and the game was made into something intentionally \\"silly\\"; the team \\"don't take ourselves or our game too seriously\\". Plot was not the primary focus of Just Cause 2, and the team took three to five months to create the story. The game runs on Avalanche Software's upgraded Avalanche Engine. Unlike Just Cause, it was released only for seventh-generation consoles and its graphics were not limited by the restrictions of older consoles. Since it is set in an open world, Avalanche co-founder Linus Bloomberg thought a long draw distance was essential to motivate players to explore the game world and the engine was modified to accommodate that feature. The PC version runs on DirectX 10 hardware, and is incompatible with Windows XP. The PlayStation 3 version allows the user to capture gameplay video and export it to the XMB or upload it to YouTube. However, most content is identical across all platforms. Marketing and release The game was announced in January 2007 by publisher Eidos Interactive, and a year later a Christmas 2008 release was planned. Its release was later postponed to the third quarter of 2009. A demo for the game, released on 4 March 2010, attracted more than two million players. According to studio founder Christofer Sundberg, the demo was envisioned as a smaller version of the game so players could fully experience its open-ended gameplay. After Japanese publisher Square Enix acquired Eidos Interactive, it announced that the game would be released in North America on 23 March 2010 and in Europe on 26 March. Pre-orders received a map of Panau and access to the Black Market Chaos Pack. An Ultimate Edition, with the game and the Black Market Aerial and Boom Packs, was released on 20 December 2011 for the PlayStation Network. =Downloadable content= According to designer Peter Johansson, the game would support a variety of downloadable content and DLC was released on PlayStation Store, Steam and Xbox Live Marketplace after the game's release. The Black Market Aerial Pack included an F-33 Dragonfly jet fighter, dual parachute thrusters and a multi-lock missile launcher. The Black Market Boom Pack included a quad rocket launcher, a cluster bomb launcher and an air- propulsion gun. The Black Market Chaos Pack included Rico's signature gun, an Agency hovercraft, a Chevalier Classic, a bull's-eye assault rifle and Tuk Tuk Boom Boom. Although the pack is no longer available, its contents may be downloaded separately. Avalanche also released several pieces of free DLC, including a Chevalier Icebreaker (an ice-cream truck with bullbars), Tuk Tuk Boom Boom (introducing a tuk tuk with a \\"roof-mounted weapon of mass destruction\\") and a Chaos Parachute pack. =Multiplayer Mod= Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod originated as a fan project by two modders, Jaxm and Trix, who were impressed with the game's scale after playing its demo. They stopped modding Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and began developing a multiplayer mod for Just Cause 2; the team eventually expanded to six. The mod was later recognized by the game's developers as an add-on. It supports achievements and adds multiplayer capability, allowing hundreds to thousands of players to interact in the game's map of Panau. After several years in the making, the mod became available as free downloadable content on Steam on 17 December 2013. Reception Just Cause 2 received generally positive reviews upon release, with critics praising its gameplay, graphics and open world; the game was widely regarded as a significant improvement to its predecessor. It was nominated for Best Action Game at the 28th Golden Joystick Awards, losing to Assassin’s Creed II. Eric Neigher of 1UP.com praised the game's texture, draw distance, depth of field and variety, writing that such details made the game feel more alive. The explosions were praised for their visual effects. According to Neigher, the varied landscape and the grappling hook made Just Cause 2 game world superior to those of Grand Theft Auto and Infamous. Eurogamer Simon Parkin commended Avalanche Studios for developing a \\"picture-postcard amalgam of Pacific landscapes\\" without significant technical difficulties, such as framework instability. However, Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot and Ryan Clements of IGN noted a number of gameplay problems, such as loose shooting mechanic and technical glitches. Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer considered its world one of the most enjoyable and entertaining sandboxes for players to explore, overshadowing other open- world games with urban settings. Just Cause 2 action elements were widely praised. Ryan Davis of Giant Bomb praised the game for its defiance of physics, increasing player enjoyment. The combined grappling hook and parachute was praised for facilitating and enhancing traversal and exploration. Eurogamer Parkin agreed, adding that the tool was a mix of Spider-Man and Bionic Commando, but Game Informer Marchiafava thought that the mechanic and its precision exceeded both. He praised the action stunts, especially skydiving (which he called \\"thrilling\\"). VanOrd described the stunts as \\"satisfying\\", \\"silly\\", \\"fun\\" and \\"crazy\\", and stated that travelling between locations was so enjoyable that players would rarely use the black marketeer. Clements praised Avalanche Studios for providing action only found in a \\"top-dollar Hollywood production\\" with the game's stunts. Parkin and Neigher commended its potential, with Parkin writing that players use their imagination to experiment with the grappling hook (making the game addictive). However, its gunplay (particularly the aiming system) was criticized. The game's difficulty and artificial intelligence were criticized as frustrating, as they sometimes spawned in front of the player. According to Clements and Marchiafava, its controls had a steep learning curve. The game's mission design and progression system received mixed reviews. According to Parkin, the chaos system did not make sense; Rico sometimes destroys properties which help local citizens. He called most missions repetitive and a \\"grind\\", losing their appeal as players progress (although he praised some side missions). Parkin and VanOrd criticized the stronghold-takeover missions. Parkin added that most players probably would not have the patience to complete the settlements, since the island's appeal wanes after hours of play. Marchiafava praised the game's side activities, saying that the diversions increased its replayability. Davis criticized the missions' repetition, but liked their quantity. Just Cause 2 story also received mixed reviews, with Neigher criticizing its mediocre voice acting and lack of logic. Clements thought the presentation of its cutscenes were not on par with the game world, and Parkin described the plot as a \\"low-rent thriller\\". Marchiafava called its story the game's weakest part, with its \\"unscripted\\" moments the high points. Most critics agreed that the strong gameplay mechanics overshadowed design and narrative flaws, and that narrative was not the game's focus. =Sales= It was the best-selling retail game in the UK when it was released, outselling Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver (released the same week). Although the initial sales projection was 2.2 million, sales exceeded expectations. In February 2014, describing its sales as \\"slow\\", studio founder Christofer Sundberg said that Just Cause 2 had sold more than six million copies. Legacy Purchasers of Just Cause 2 and another Square Enix game, Sleeping Dogs, received an exclusive Rico Rodriguez outfit and the ability to perform \\"stunt-style takeovers\\" while hijacking vehicles as Officer Shen. After the game's release, the Swedish team developed Mad Max. A studio based in New York City was established to develop a new game, set in the Just Cause universe. Just Cause 3 was Game Informers November 2014 cover game, and it was scheduled for release on 1 December 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Purchasers of Just Cause 3 for the Xbox One would also receive Just Cause 2 via backward compatibility.

They were first formed in the early 1960s and have seen many changes in their line up since. A considerable number of the cream of the North East's folk talent has at one time played with The Teesside Fettlers, including Vin Garbutt, Ron Angel, Richard Grainger, Bob Skingle and Adrian Beadnell. The band have performed across the UK, on the international circuit at festivals, concerts and on radio and television. They sing mainly about Teesside, North Yorkshire and Durham, telling the story of the development of the region, its industrial heritage and the beautiful countryside that surrounds it. A regular request for the group is to provide Ceilidh evenings at which their resident caller, Ron Marshall joins them. Frontman for the band is Stewart McFarlane MBE who provides lead vocals and percussion (including playing spoons and bones for ceilidhs). He is joined by Alan Helm playing accordion, guitar and electric bass and Stan Gee on banjo, fiddle and guitar. Heritage A fettler is an old craft from the iron and steel industry that grew in the north east of England. His job was to remove the excess material from castings, by \\"fettling\\" them. To fettle is to put right, fix: \\"I'll fettle you\\". The word remains in common use in the North East and is synonymous in the area with the group. In 2000, the band received National Lottery funding to produce a CD compilation of their music, to be used in schools and colleges as part of an education programme. BBC Television have shown considerable interest in the band over the years, making a 30-minute documentary in 1976,Travelling the Tees, featuring the band making a musical journey down the River Tees from Cauldron Snout to Teesmouth. The band were invited twice by Sir Harry Secombe to appear on ITV's Highway. On the first occasion, they crossed the Transporter Bridge in a charabanc performing \\"Ring of Iron\\". In the second, they were filmed at Whitby harbour singing \\"Cædmon\\" about an Anglo Saxon poet and \\"The Whitby Whaler\\", a song written by Richard Grainger, and recorded by the band on their album Ring of Iron. The band were regular performers at folk music festivals, making several unprecedented repeat appearances at Sidmouth and the Rose of Tralee. The band's music The band play a mix of traditional and locally written songs, together with their comprehensive ceilidh set. Many of their contemporary songs have been written by members of the band, or specifically for the band by local songwriters. They favour songs which describe the history of the area; not just the beautiful rolling countryside, but also about the pollution and industrial impact. Well known, and often requested songs include \\"The Hartlepool Monkey\\" written by Alan Wilkinson, an early member of the band. Their album Travelling the Tees contains their song \\"The Procession\\", an imaginary account of a Royal visit to open a Hospital Ward in Middlesbrough. Written by Graeme Miles, it paints a humorous picture of life in the rough end of town. \\"Ring of Iron\\" (Miles), \\"Chemical Workers Song\\" (Angel) and \\"Blue Sunset\\" (Miles), describe the pollution and hard working conditions of local industries. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"I Will Stay\\" (both Skingle) describe the contrast between the hard industrial development of Teesside and the open moorland less than 20 minutes by car. \\"The Blackleg Miner\\" (traditional) foretells the likely fate of those who would break strikes at the coal mines in Northumberland. \\"The Boars Head Carol\\" (traditional) is a powerful unaccompanied song.

His work has earned him an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award, as well as nominations for three additional Oscars, two more Golden Globes, eight Grammy Awards, and two Tony Awards. Early life Pitchford was born in Honolulu, where he attended Catholic schools, graduating in 1968 from Saint Louis High School. He began his performance career as an actor and a singer with the Honolulu Community Theatre (now Diamond Head Theatre), the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra and the Honolulu Theatre for Youth, among others. While studying at Yale University, Pitchford performed with numerous campus drama groups, but his focus gradually turned off-campus, where he worked with the Wooster Square Revival, an experimental theatre company that offered acting opportunities to recovering addicts and alcoholics. In 1969, Pitchford returned to Honolulu as an assistant to authors Faye Hammel and Sylvan Levey in updating the popular guidebook Hawai’i on $5 and $10 A Day, and researching Trans World Airlines’ Budget Guide to Hawai’i, the first of a series of guidebooks that would eventually turn into the popular series TWA Getaway Guides. Performing In 1971, Pitchford was cast in the off- Broadway musical, Godspell in New York City. He also starred in Godspell at Ford's Theatre. Bob Fosse cast Pitchford as Pippin in the Broadway show of the same name in 1975. While in Pippin, Pitchford acted, sang, and danced in over 100 commercials for such products as Dr Pepper, McDonald's, Lay's, and M&M;'s. Early songwriting As a result of performing his early songwriting efforts in cabarets around Manhattan, he was invited to write with such composers as Stephen Schwartz, Alan Menken and Rupert Holmes. In 1979, he collaborated with recording artist and cabaret performer Peter Allen to write new songs for Allen’s one-man Broadway revue, Up In One. With composer Michael Gore, Pitchford collaborated on three songs for Alan Parker's 1980 motion picture Fame; these were \\"Red Light,\\" a disco hit for singer Linda Clifford; the symphonic/rock finale \\"I Sing the Body Electric;\\" and the title song \\"Fame,\\" which became a multi-platinum, international best seller for Irene Cara. That song earned Gore and Pitchford an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year (1981). They also received a Grammy nomination for Best Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. When Pitchford was signed by Warner Brothers Publishing (1981) he began collaborating with a variety of songwriters. Among the first songs whose lyrics he wrote in collaboration with composer Tom Snow was \\"Don't Call It Love,\\" which was first recorded by Kim Carnes on her 1981 album Mistaken Identity; the selection charted in the U.S. country singles top-ten for Dolly Parton in 1985 and was named the BMI Country Song of the Year. For the ill-fated 1981 movie The Legend of the Lone Ranger, Pitchford wrote a narrative ballad, \\"The Man In the Mask.\\" This was spoken (throughout the movie) and sung (at its beginning and end) by Merle Haggard. \\"You Should Hear How She Talks About You,\\" another Snow/Pitchford composition, was a Top 5 hit for Melissa Manchester for which she won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1983. That same year, Pitchford, Kenny Loggins and Steve Perry wrote and composed \\"Don’t Fight It,\\" a Top 20 hit that was Grammy- nominated in the Best Pop Vocal Duo category. With musical director Michael Miller, he wrote the theme song for the weekly dance-music show Solid Gold (1980–88). Screenwriting Inspired by a 1979 news story about Elmore City, Oklahoma, a town which had finally lifted an 80-year-old ban on dancing, Pitchford wrote the screenplay for the motion picture Footloose (1984). He collaborated on the nine-song score with Kenny Loggins, Eric Carmen, Jim Steinman, Sammy Hagar and others. The film, directed by Herbert Ross, opened at #1 and was, at the time, the highest-grossing February release in film history. When the soundtrack album hit #1 on the Billboard album charts, it deposed Michael Jackson’s Thriller and held that position for 10 weeks. It went on top charts all over the world, eventually selling more than 17 million albums. Kenny Loggins's single of the title song hit #1 on March 31, 1984, and stayed there for three weeks. Five weeks later (May 26, 1984) Deniece Williams’s \\"Let’s Hear It for the Boy\\" went to #1, as well. Four more songs from the soundtrack charted in the Top 40; \\"Almost Paradise,\\" which reached #7, was co-written with Eric Carmen, and was performed by Mike Reno of Loverboy and Ann Wilson of Heart; \\"Dancing in the Sheets,\\" which reached #17, was co-written with Bill Wolfer, and was performed by Shalamar; \\"I’m Free (Heaven Helps the Man),\\" which reached #22 and, like the film's title track, was co-written with, and performed by, Kenny Loggins; and \\"Holding Out for a Hero,\\" which reached #34, was co-written with Jim Steinman, and was performed by Bonnie Tyler. \\"Footloose\\" was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Song; and \\"Footloose\\" and \\"Let's Hear It for the Boy\\" (co-written with Tom Snow) both received Academy Award nominations (1985). Pitchford received two Grammy nominations: Best Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, and Best R&B; Song \\"Dancing in the Sheets.\\" Paramount Pictures's remake of Footloose, which was again based on Pitchford's original screenplay and featured six of his songs, was released in October 2011. Blake Shelton had a hit with his re-recording of the title song. Next Pitchford wrote the screenplay of, and collaborated on the authorship and composition of all the songs for, the 1989 musical film Sing. Directing Pitchford wrote and directed a short film, The Washing Machine Man (1991), for Chanticleer Films; it was invited to be shown out-of-competition at the Sundance Film Festival. That led to Pitchford's hiring as director of HBO's Blood Brothers; The Joey DiPaolo Story (1992), which won that year's Cable Ace Award for Best Children's Program. Later songwriting With Marvin Hamlisch, Pitchford wrote Welcome, the Invocation for the Opening Ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics; it was performed by a choir of 1,000 voices in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. He co-wrote the song \\"Did You Hear Thunder?,\\" with Tom Snow, for the George Benson album While the City Sleeps... (1986). For the motion picture Chances Are (1989), Pitchford and Tom Snow composed \\"After All,\\" an international hit for Cher and Peter Cetera which garnered Pitchford his fourth Oscar nomination; and two years later Pitchford's and Gore's \\"All the Man That I Need\\" was a worldwide #1 for Whitney Houston. The soundtrack for the 1988 film Oliver & Company, to which Pitchford and Tom Snow contributed \\"Streets of Gold,\\" sung by Ruth Pointer, was Grammy-nominated. Pitchford contributed lyrics to Richard Marx's song \\"That Was Lulu\\" for Marx's 1989 album Repeat Offender, with whom he also wrote \\"Through My Eyes\\" for Martina McBride for the Bambi II soundtrack. He worked for many years on a stage adaptation of Footloose, which finally opened on Broadway on October 22, 1998. The original cast recording was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Musical Show Album. After over 700 performances, the show closed on July 2, 2000. The musical continues to be performed all over the U.S. and around the world. The stage musical of Carrie, with Pitchford's lyrics (music by Michael Gore, book by Lawrence D. Cohen), was presented by MCC Theatre in New York City as the final offering in their 2011-12 season. A previous production of that show had been presented in 1988 by the Royal Shakespeare Company, first in Stratford-upon-Avon in England, and then in a famously short run on Broadway at the Virginia Theatre. The 2012 MCC production was nominated for Best Revival by numerous critics's groups, including the Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards.Official website for Carrie the Musical, carriethemusical.com; accessed July 15, 2015. Australian film star Hugh Jackman won a Tony Award for his portrayal of songwriter Peter Allen in The Boy from Oz (2003), in which he sang songs (\\"Not the Boy Next Door\\" and \\"Once Before I Go\\") which had been written and composed more than two decades earlier by the real Allen (by then deceased) and Pitchford. Jackman repeated his performances of those songs when he returned to New York City in his one- man concert, \\"Hugh Jackman - Back on Broadway\\" (2011). Pitchford has contributed songs to The Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003); Shrek 2 (2004); Ice Princess (2005); and Bambi II (2006). In March, 2018, the 1984 recording of \\"Footloose\\" was named to the 2017 National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. Fiction writing G. P. Putnam's Sons/Penguin Group published Pitchford's first young adult novel, The Big One-Oh, in March 2007, and Random House's Listening Library released the audiobook (read by Pitchford) in January 2008. That recording received a 2008 Grammy nomination in the category of Best Spoken Word Album for Children. His second novel, Captain Nobody, was published by G.P. Putnam's Sons/Penguin Group and released on audiobook by Random House in 2009. That recording received a 2009 nomination in the same Grammy category.

Raffles (also known as Lord Lister) is a fictional character who first appeared in a German pulp magazine entitled \\"Lord Lister, genannt Raffles, der Meisterdieb\\" published in 1908, written by Kurt Matull and Theo Blakensee. The series was continued after a few issues as \\"Lord Lister, genannt Raffles, der große Unbekannte\\" (\\"...Known as Raffles, the Great Unknown\\"), which was the title of the first novel. The series became very popular and was translated, as well as continued in a number of countries and achieved such a popularity that Raffles was used in an Italian series as an opponent for Nick Carter, as Carter's European equivalent, a context in which he has been described as Europe's greatest pulp hero. Unlike Nick Carter, Lord Lister was never thoroughly updated. The Dutch series was the last surviving one, ending in 1968. The first English translation of The Great Unknown was published in February 2015. Countries in which Raffles was published =Germany= In Germany the original series published by Verlag Gustav Müller & Co in Berlin, trying to cash in on the popularity of A.J. Raffles with a similar character, ran for 110 weekly issues and ended with the marriage of Lord Lister in 1910. Issues were still sold into the first years of the First World War. The series has been republished incompletely during the interbellum. =Denmark= Denmark produced more than 144 Lord Lister stories. =France= In France the real name of Lord Lister was changed to John C. Sinclair. Copyright reasons involving A.J. Raffles have been used as an explanation for that. For some reason this version seems to be the \\"authentic\\" version to Wold Newton Universe researchers, rather than the original German or the longest lasting Dutch version. =Malaysia= Cheritera Kechurian Lima Million Ringgit written by Muhammad bin Muhammad Said is considered the first Malaysian detective novel and features as foil for Nick Carter the famous heroic English thief John C. Sinclair (see France), as well as his arch enemy Baxter. =Netherlands= Publication of the original German series in a biweekly Dutch translation started in 1910 (Source: Lord Listerklub). The original series was followed by 16 issues (or 15, the Lord Listerklub lists #119 as \\"never seen yet\\") by an unknown author, in which many of the stories were situated in the Netherlands. From June 14, 1923, the first issue, \\"De Onbekende\\", appeared as a feuilleton in the newspaper Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad. Starting with #127 the stories were written by Felix Hageman as an uncredited author. Starting with #514 more or less updated and renamed reprints of Dutch and German stories appeared in the series, mixed with new stories. The last new stories were published in the early 1930s. In 1938 a certain P. Sonnega wrote rather positively about Raffles in an article titled Die Detectiveroman (That Detective Novel)appearing in De Groene Amsterdammer of 15 January 1938, in which he, after making clear that one could be both an intellectual and a Lord Lister fan, described Raffles as a fascinating figure in evening costume wearing a cape with a red silk lining. This infuriated Felix Hageman and after having kept his identity as Lord Lister author a secret for almost a quarter of a century, as he was not very proud about this part of his penmanship, he made his identity public in a reaction to De Groene Amsterdammer to strengthen his claim that Lord Lister would never wear a cape with a red lining, but would as a gentleman always wear a cape with a white silk lining. Nevertheless, in 1940 the Dutch poet-journalist-critic Halbo C. Kool published his own story \\"Lord Lister en de toverspiegel\\" (\\"Lord Lister and the Magic Mirror\\").In: Het boek van de Prinses voor het Roode Kruis. Introd. Prinses Juliana (Jac. v. Kampen, Amsterdam 1940), pp. 167-172. The Second World War meant a publication stop for the series. Publication was resumed in 1946. In 1954 the publication of different versions for Flanders and the Netherlands was started. The differences between the national versions was however limited to the price (different currencies) and the # of the issue (Belgium started with #3000, while the Dutch series had that issue as #2228). A similar jump in numbers to indicate a new series had been made after the war as well, when over 600 issue #'s were skipped to start the new series with # 2001. The last Lord Lister \\"Het Kostbare Parelsnoer\\" appeared at the end of 1967 as #3687 in Belgium and in January 1968 as #2915 in the Netherlands. =Belgium= A Belgian re-edition in French language has been published by Claude Lefrancq Editeur ( Brussels) in 1995 (Vol.I) and 1996 (Vol.II), Editor Yves Varende authoring an erudite introduction and foreword about the topic. =Spain= The Spanish edition, \\"Lord Lister conocido por Raffles el Rey de los Ladrones\\" was published by Editorial Atlante, Barcelona, in 1910, and ran 68 issues. A new series, \\"Nuevas Proeza de John C. Raffles\\" was published by Ediciones Marco, circa 1930, and ran at least 31 issues. =Argentina= Publisher Editorial Atlante, Barcelona, sold an abridged version of its 1910 Spanish translations in Argentina, reprinting the original covers with a white border and starting with Spanish issue No. 4 \\"El Tesoro en un sacótago\\" (\\"The Treasure in the Coffin\\") renumbered as No. 1 by placing a printed sticker over the original number. The character Lord Lister Raffles was a Victorian era gentleman thief and a born member of nobility. The first issue of the original German series reveals that the notorious thief John C. Raffles is really Lord Edward Lister. A number of different, somewhat conflicting origin stories exist to explain why a genuine Lord would become a thief, involving having been robbed from his inheritance, poverty in childhood, boredom or overindulgence in charity. With his secret identity exposed Raffles is forced to create and maintain a large number of false ones, of which the main one is Lord William Aberdeen. Depending on the origin story this title could be genuine, the name and identity are false. The character, though originally a sort of a hero villain, grew more and more into a heroic character, a thief, certainly, but a thief like Robin Hood, embodiment of the ideals of the nobility, protecting the weak, punishing and reforming the bad guys (by theft), supporting the poor and often curing the ill. Raffles is a medical doctor, a chemist, an engineer and an inventor. That combination results in his most remarkable ability: Raffles can by means of his medical/chemical knowledge change the colour and texture of his hair and his skin and the colour of his eyes. He used this ability almost exclusively for his own disguises, combined with more conventional disguise tricks. As a result of this his true age is always somewhat unclear. As a very handsome and muscular man he cannot disguise himself as a female person convincingly, unlike his companions, be it that Henderson seems always a remarkably tall and muscular lady. Raffles cannot be hypnotised by normal means, but can hypnotise people himself. Raffles speaks quite some languages, including Dutch, French, Russian and Hungarian. Considering less exceptional abilities, they can be simply summarized by stating that, but for eating with chopsticks, Raffles can do everything. For a Victorian gentleman, Lord Lister is refreshingly free from racist views. A World War I-induced dislike towards Germans is present in Hageman's version of the character. Scenes in which topless ladies occur are sometimes noticeable, but those scenes are rather free from erotic implications, as they tend to involve Raffles as a doctor or a detective discovering something clearly of great importance. As such the series was seen as one of the better pulps, not unfit for children. His arch-enemy is the rather incompetent inspector Baxter (Scotland Yard), whose more competent assistant is an admirer of Raffles. Sidekicks to Raffles are the giant James Henderson, his driver and servant, and Charles Brand, his secretary, financial manager and friend. Henderson is very strong, he lifts 800 kg with ease and a good hand-to-hand fighter. Charles Brand however is the best shot and the fastest runner of the three, as well as the only one who can disguise himself convincingly as a girl or a woman. Relations between the three are warm, but Lord Lister is the master. In the first story, \\"Der grosse Unbekannte\\" (\\"The Great Unknown\\") Sherlock Holmes has sent a letter to his foil Scotland Yard's Captain Baxter declining aiding in capturing Raffles, since he finds it amusing that the police can't capture him.

He was succeeded by his eldest son Alasdair in June of that year. Tragedy struck the family again when Alasdair was killed in a flying accident in 1938, and the title passed to his younger brother Roderic.

Aircraft=MacRobert's Reply= After the deaths of the three Macrobert brothers in RAF service, their mother, Lady Rachel Workman MacRobert, wanted to honour and commemorate them. She donated £25,000 to buy a Short Stirling bomber, which was named MacRobert's Reply. left The plane had serial number N6086 and had the MacRobert coat of arms painted on its nose. The plane was handed over to her crew at RAF Wyton on October 10, 1941, with Lady MacRobert attending the naming ceremony. She was assigned to No. XV Squadron and was given the code \\"LS-F\\" (\\"LS\\", the squadron code for No. 15 Squadron, and \\"F for Freddie\\"). The aircraft flew twelve missions, from October 1941 through January 1942. On 7 February 1942, the plane veered off during take-off at RAF Peterhead, and collided with a damaged Supermarine Spitfire. After this accident, a second Short Stirling, serial number W7531, was named MacRobert's Reply (it was not officially named MacRobert's Reply until after entering service in March 1942). The aircraft was lost during a minelaying raid against the Øresund in May 1942; it was brought down by anti- aircraft fire and crashed into Gals Klint Forest, near the town of Middelfart. Only one member of the crew, Sergeant Donald Jeffs, survived the crash. With the loss of the second Stirling the MacRobert's Reply tradition ended. In April 1982, the tradition was revived by No. XV Squadron with the naming of Hawker Siddeley Buccaneer S.2B XT287 (coded \\"F\\") as MacRobert's Reply. The MacRobert family crest was also added onto the fuselage below the cockpit canopy. Squadron Leader Peter Boggis (who was the first pilot to fly the original 'MacRobert's Reply') unveiled the aircraft at No. XV Squadron's former base RAF Mildenhall. No. XV Squadron maintained the tradition when it converted to the Panavia Tornado in 1983 with Tornado GR.1B ZA446 (\\"F\\") bearing the MacRobert's Reply name and MacRobert family crest. Over the next 34 years another three Tornados bore the name and crest (ZA559, ZA602 and ZD741) until the squadron disbanded on 31 March 2017.

Life His parents died while he was very young, and he owed his early education to relations. After completing the usual Gymnasium at Rheine and at Münster, he matriculated at the academy in Münster, where he devoted himself particularly to mathematics. In 1859 he entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Münster and after his philosophical studies was appointed professor of mathematics and astronomy at Maria-Laach. He spent the years from 1867 to 1871 in the study of theology and was ordained priest in 1870. Gabriel García Moreno, President of Ecuador, had petitioned the General of the Jesuits in the early seventies for members of the Society to form the faculty of the Polytechnicum in Quito, which he had recently founded. A number of German Jesuits responded to the call, among them Epping, who set out in June, 1872, for Quito to become professor of mathematics. He learned Spanish and wrote a textbook of geometry. The political disturbances which followed the assassination of Moreno (6 August 1875) made it necessary for the Jesuits to return to Europe, and Epping arrived in the Netherlands in the fall of 1876. He spent the remaining years of his life at Blijenbeck, and later at Exaeten, teaching astronomy and mathematics, devoting his leisure to research and literary work. Works Epping's first published volume, Der Kreislauf im Kosmos, appeared in 1882. It was an exposition and critique of the Kant-Laplace nebular hypothesis; and a refutation of the pantheistic and materialistic conclusions which had been drawn from it. His most important work, however, was begun in collaboration with Father Johann Nepomuk Strassmaier who, in connection with his own studies in Assyriology, had induced him to undertake a mathematical investigation of the Babylonian astronomical observations and tables. After considerable labour the key was found. He discovered the table of differences for the new moon in one of the tablets, and identified Guttu with Mars, Sakku with Saturn, and Te- ut with Jupiter (Epping and Strassmaier in Stimmen aus Maria-Laach, vol. 21, pp. 277–292). Eight years later he published Astronomisches aus Babylon oder das Wissen der Chaldäer über den gestirnten Himmel (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1889). This work was of importance both from the standpoint of astronomy and chronology. It contains an exposition of the astronomy of the ancient Babylonians, worked out from their Ephemerides of the moon and the planets. This was supplemented by Die babylonische Berechnung des Neumondes (Stimmen aus Maria-Laach, Vol. XXXIX, pp. 229–240). He was also the author of a number of articles in the Zeitschrift für Assyriologie. References *Baumgartner in Zeitsch. f.

He was the son of Gisela, a widowed refugee from East Prussia, mother of three, and of Stanislaw Wisniewski from Kutno, a former forced labourer in German Arbeitseinsatz during World War II, who died on 9 October 1953 in Tübingen.

In 1968, Wisniewski abandoned an apprenticeship as electrician, and was then forced in 1969/1970 to live in reform school, from which he fled seven times within a year. At the time, other future members of the RAF, Ulrike Meinhof (Bambule) and Gudrun Ensslin, protested also against such institutions. After his release, he moved to Hamburg, where he became an engineer on a ship. In the course of his travels, he said, he got to know the plight of the Third World.

He protested the detention of RAF members and participated in squattings and in the protests against the conservative Springer press. After the death of Holger Meins, a member of the RAF, as the result of a hunger strike in 1974, Wisniewski joined the group. In 1975, he participated in the West German Embassy siege. In the summer of 1976, Wisniewski was in a training camp of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Southern Yemen. In August 1977, he participated in a bank robbery in Essen, to finance the upcoming kidnapping of Hanns Martin Schleyer, an employers' representative and former SS member. Wisniewski was not only part of the group which kidnapped Schleyer, he was also the one who called the shots at the scene of the kidnapping. While his collaborators shot Schleyer's driver and body guards, Wisniewski drove the van in which Schleyer was taken away. It is believed that it was Wisniewski, nicknamed Die Furie (the fury), who later transferred Schleyer from Cologne to another group hideout in Brussels, Belgium, in the trunk of a car. Weeks later, Schleyer was shot and killed in a forest after the first generation RAF members died in Stammheim Prison. According to Peter-Jürgen Boock Schleyer was shot by Rolf Heißler and Stefan Wisniewski. Prison On May 11, 1978, Wisniewski was arrested at Orly Airport in Paris and extradited to Germany. After his arrest, he was aggressive from the start. During an interrogation he assaulted a custodial judge after jumping over two tables, until he was subdued by a guard. For this, he was convicted and sentenced to eight months in prison. On March 28, Wisniewski attempted to escape from prison. Somehow, he acquired a knife and scissors, which he used to overcome a guard. He bound and gagged the guard and locked him in a cell. While leaving the prison, Wisniewski was spotted by another guard. While being returned to his cell, Wisniewski attacked the director of the jail with a sock filled with batteries. During the trial, which took several months, Wisniewski went on hunger strike, but was force- fed. On December 4, 1981, Stefan Wisniewski was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for murder, kidnapping, coercion of a constitutional body, and membership in a terrorist organization. He commented on the verdict by saying that he did not care. In a 1997 interview with die tageszeitung, a German daily newspaper, Wisniewski called the murder of Schleyer a \\"disaster\\".

It tells the story of a priest named Romuald who falls in love with Clarimonde, a beautiful woman who turns out to be a vampire. Plot summary The story opens with the elderly priest Romuald recounting the story of his first love, Clarimonde. On the day of his ordination many years ago, he sees a beautiful young woman in the church. He hears a woman's voice promising to love him and to make him happier than he would be in Paradise. Conflicted between 'love at first sight' and his religious beliefs, he finishes the ceremony despite her entreaties. On his way back to the seminary, a page greets him and gives him a card reading: \\"Clarimonde, at the Palace Concini\\". Romuald is stationed in a quiet location in the country and feels trapped by his priesthood. He continues his studies but is distracted and plagued by the memory of Clarimonde. Father Sérapion senses something is off with Romuald and tells him about the legend of the infamous Clarimonde the courtesan, who has recently died. Romuald asks Sérapion about the palace, and Sérapion answers that it is the Palace Concini, where Clarimonde lives. He informs Romuald that it is a place of great debauchery. Sérapion warns Romuald that it is not the first time Clarimonde has died. One night, a mysterious looking man on horseback arrives to Romuald's parish, and asks for Romuald to come with him. They ride on horseback to a lavish castle in the country. As Romuald dismounts his horse, he is told that it is too late for the woman and that she's dead. He is led to the woman's chamber to perform the rites, only to discover that the woman is Clarimonde. In his grief, he kisses her, temporarily breathing life into her. She says they will shortly be reunited and Romuald faints as he sees her spirit leave. Romuald believes all that had passed with Clarimonde had been a dream; but a few days later, she appears to him in his room. Clarimonde appears dead, but beautiful, and tells him to prepare for a trip. The two of them travel to Venice and live together. Clarimonde's health wavers and she seems to be dying, but she is restored after she drinks some of Romuald's blood from an accidental finger cut. Romuald realizes that Clarimonde is a vampire, but continues his relationship with her. Father Sérapion pays a concerned visit to Romuald over his affairs with Clarimonde. Sérapion is adamant that Romuald’s desires for Clarimonde are born from sin and takes Romuald to her tomb. He reveals her body is miraculously preserved thanks to Romuald's blood. Seeing blood on the corner of her lip, Father Sérapion becomes furious and calls her a demon as he pours holy water on her corpse. She crumbles into dust, but returns to Romuald later that night and admonishes him for his betrayal. She then vanishes forever. Back in the present, Romuald tells his audience that this was the greatest regret of his life and suggests that his listeners never look at a woman lest they meet the same fate, even as he still misses Clarimonde. Characters *Romuald, a young priest who falls in love with Clarimonde. Throughout the short story, Romuald struggles to reconcile two distinct parts of himself—one that wishes to be a celibate priest and one that wishes to be Clarimonde's lover. *Clarimonde, a courtesan who is revealed to be a vampire. Her name suggests the embodiment of both good and evil. She survives by drinking Romuald's blood, but only taking what is needed (a few drops) for her vitality. *Sérapion, a priest who discourages Romuald's relationship. He is solely linked to the Church and his intervention provides appropriate moral imperatives that Romuald is to follow as a priest. Themes=Life and Death= \\"La Morte amoureuse\\" plays with the boundaries between life and death. For example, as Clarimonde is a vampire, she is a creature of hybridity: one that comes from life and from death, neither fully monster nor human. It is through her hybrid nature that she is capable of traveling between the realms of life and death. Her reason for returning from the dead is love and her relationship with Romuald has been compared to the Platonic myth of Aristophanes. Wang, Ying. \\"La puissance fantastique de la femme vampire dans \\"La Morte amoureuse\\"\\" Nineteenth-Century French Studies 38.3/4 (2010): pp. 172-82. Romuald, conflicted about his dual life, can also be regarded in the same manner: dead (or rather not living) during his priestly duties in the day, but alive and vivacious in the evenings as Il signor Romualdo, Clarimonde's lover. =Nightmare= Nightmares are culturally significant. Dreams and nightmares were often analyzed scientifically based on what appeared to the dreamer; for instance, certain colors equated to specific emotional states. Nightmares were considered to be a consequence of demon intervention and, more rarely, a side-effect of a psychological disorder. The nightmare, more literally, refers to as a bad dream or a black horse that sits on the chest of men and women at night and suffocates them to cause fear or terror. The terms incubus and succubus share the same Latin root. The two terms were birthed from the word concubinus and the term concumbre (to lie alongside). In the text, Romauld refers to the horse that carries him to Clarimonde's castle as a ghost of the famous horse \\"Nightmare.\\" The nightmare presented in Gautier's text relates to his time with Clarimonde as being dream-like. Nocturnal demons are associated with erotic dreams and the time that Romauld shares with Clarimonde in his dream-space is certainly erotic. Roumald may not be dreaming of living in Clarimonde's world, but rather, Clarimonde may be inventing Romauld to satisfy her own desires.Downing, Lisa (July 2012). \\"Gendered Constructions of the Nightmare in French Nineteenth- Century Medical Writing and Fantastic Fiction\\". French Studies. 66 (3). Retrieved August 19, 2016 – via Project MUSE. In this case, Romauld is the nightmare and not Clarimonde. =Love is Greater Than Death= The plot of Théophile Gautier's French, romantic short story, \\"La Morte Amoureuse\\" focuses on the idea that love can overcome death. For example, when the protagonist, Romuald, is called to give last rites to a great courtesan who has fallen ill, he recognizes her as Clarimonde. The same Clarimonde who had, earlier in the short story, fallen in love with Romuald at first sight during his ordination. Without realizing it he had fallen in love with her also. So when he goes to her in the castle, instead of giving her last rites and allowing her to die, he decides to kiss her. So, with the power of his love for her passing through his lips, Romuald kisses Clarimonde and brings her back to life. Both characters fall in love despite the oppositions of both of their worlds; for Romuald, that of God and the church, and for Clarimonde, that of Satan (woman and pleasure). These two traditionally opposed realms of existence create a divide in what is considered the physical and metaphysical.DiLiberti, Julia. \\"Vampires Suck But Not as Much as the Men Who Use Them: The Narratological Strategy of the Vampire chez Gautier.\\" In Aimer et mourir: Love, Death, and Women’s Lives in Texts of French Expression, ed. Eilene Hoft-March, and Judith Holland Sarnecki, 66-97. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars, 2009. Their love, in other words, transcends both realms and exists to defy physical and metaphysical laws. =Allegory= The plot can be read as an allegory in which Clarimonde, a manifestation of Romuald's sexual desires, is the devil luring man, represented through Romuald, to sin through temptation. The allegorical interpretation of the story is embodied by Clarimonde's desire to break Romuald’s priestly vows of chastity through seducing him, Romuald’s mutual desire for her, and contrasting descriptions of her as \\"divine\\" from a distance and \\"cold as a serpent’s skin\\" when touched. A second allegorical interpretation is also possible. According to Virginia Marino, \\"Clarimonde nevertheless represents the life force and its inescapable physicality,\\" both through surviving in the world of the living as an undead vampire and through Gautier's persistent physical comparisons of her to the \\"four elements\\" of nature: air, fire, water, and earth. By becoming a priest, Romuald is dedicating himself to a life of restraint that Clarimonde persistently tries to undermine. Though Romuald is living, the priesthood, and therefore Romuald, is associated with death through self-restraint of human desire. Additionally, Marino states that \\"the narrator suddenly feels life rise in him...when he sees her.\\" =Femmes Fatales= La Morte Amoureuse follows the trope of femmes fatales, the fatality to the male victim from female seduction. Femme fatales are often depicted in medieval literature as an alluring woman who leads men into harmful situations. The story begins with an elderly Romuald answering the question if he has ever loved. He answers that he has but describes this occurrence as a \\"bewitchment to which [he] fell victim\\". Clarimonde shows up in Romuald's life during the day of his ordination and is described by Romuald as \\"a young woman of rare beauty\\". From this moment onward, Romuald is encaptured by Clarimonde's beauty and is taken away from his life as a priest to live in Venice with Clarimonde, who is later revealed to be a vampire who survives by drinking his blood as he sleeps. Clarimonde is extremely looked down upon by Father Sérapion, and her fate at the end of the story shows that she was not worthy of keeping alive. Romuald's constant guilt and fear of his love for Clarimonde shows that he knows he should not be involved with her; yet his lust and Clarimonde's sexuality outweighs his conscience. Several of Gautier's works have this sort of female archetype. \\"Omphale\\" and \\"Arria Marcella\\" are both stories involving femme fatale women.DiLiberti, Julia. \\"Vampires Suck But Not as Much as the Men Who Use Them: The Narratological Strategy of the Vampire chez Gautier.\\" In Aimer et mourir: Love, Death, and Women’s Lives in Texts of French Expression, ed. Eilene Hoft-March, and Judith Holland Sarnecki, 66-97. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars, 2009. = Eroticism = Clarimonde is a vampire and like Dracula she represents \\"the highest symbolic representation of eroticism\\" in Gautier's short story. This is a different take on the vampire theme, since most vampires are males who seduce females. In this story, it is the female vampire who seduces a young man. Here we have a female vampire that seduces a male. The most famous, vampire Dracula, he is often the object of woman's desire but here the genders are switched and Clarimonde becomes the lover in the story. The scenes where she sucks on his blood is an erotic moment in the story and leaves Romuald into a higher state. Fantastic can also be viewed of a longing or desire that may not be known to us. = Blood = Blood is an important theme in this story because it is what keeps Clarimonde alive. Without Romuald's blood she would die and thus it links the two characters. Oftentimes fantastic themes incorporate this dark and violent setting. Included are themes about the afterlife and that is where vampires come in because vampires represent immortality but they also represent it in the living dead. = The Other = The other is represented here as Clarimonde. Her history shows her to be a courtesan and she is described as being beautiful beyond reproach. The rumors around her orgies are meant to depict her as being evil but they also are meant to exploit her sexuality. She represents all that is evil and even Romuald struggles with living between hedonism and a man of the cloth. Analysis=Academic Discourse (Gautier)= Gautier is considered a \\"realist\\" and romantic to a certain extent since he portrays the context of love. Epstein asserts that such \\"poetic metaphors express obsessions\\". Thus, these metaphors tend to be private and are within the state of malaise. In Gautier's stories, the heroes are bound to desire of sexuality. Based on Gautier's academic discourse, his work is categorized as \\"fulfillment dreams and as anxiety dreams\\". His tales are often fantasies with irony and a dream sequence. In La Morte Amoureuse, the priest who falls in love with Clarimonde experiences a sense of anxiety. Once Clarimonde dies, she becomes a vampire and is constantly possessing the priest throughout the story. In this story, Gautier is indicating that possession in the materialistic world is a sin, or considered \\"damnation\\". Overall, Gautier's work emphasizes desires, dreams, and fantasies throughout.

It is used by both students and teachers to test and sharpen their understanding. Practice is primarily seen in Zen traditions, particularly Rinzai Zen and the Kwan Um School of Zen. In both, it is a key component in the Dharma transmission process. Zen practitioners will often have a sanzen, where the student has a face to face interview with their master. This is also called nishitsu, which literally means \\"entering the room\\" and refers to the student entering the room for private dharma combat. An exchange is initiated when a master issues a challenge to members either individually or as a group. The master will use confrontation as an emotionally charged tool to push a student into immediate realization. The Dharma combat usually appears to be in the form of a debate, with questions and answers that seem illogical to an outside observer. These encounters may involve dialogues with non-verbal elements as well as verbal. An exchange between combatants will often show disjointed comments, shouting and even slapping. These encounters, where the student's flaws in understanding or practice of dharma are exposed, have left students with a reluctance to enter the room used for combat. As Peter D. Hershock asserts, the term itself provides insight into the risks of the encounter between student and master. Traditionally, Buddhism is known for helping others to attain peace and freedom from affliction. The usage of a martial term to describe enlightenment, he attests, cannot be accidental. The student is in danger of losing the ability to maintain their prior chosen heading, much the same as in a battle.  History  The first known recorded examples of Dharma combat occurred during the \\"Classical\\" period of Zen history. Stretching roughly from 765 to 950 C.E., this period saw the rise of many Zen masters whose work is still widely studied in modern Zen Buddhism today. One of these masters was Línjì Yìxuán (Rinzai Gigen in Japanese). Linji died in 866 and was the founder of the Linji school of Zen Buddhism during the Tang dynasty in China. Many examples of dharma combat can be found in the collection of sayings by and about Línjì. On occasions the Dharma combat of Linji even extended to physical handling, as in the following example: In another example, he recounts a question from Ma-yu: \\"Of the eyes of the thousand-armed bodhisattva of compassion, which is the true eye?\\" Línjì repeats the question, adding \\"Answer me! Answer me!\\" Then, Ma-yu \\"dragged the Master down from the lecture seat and sat in it himself.\\" NotesReferences     Category:Zen Buddhist terminology Category:Zen Buddhist concepts Category:Kwan Um School of Zen Dharma combat ","title":"Dharma combat"},{"id":"15026287","text":"Tuek Chour is a khum (commune) of Preah Netr Preah District in Banteay Meanchey Province in north-western Cambodia.

Today it is a standard of barbershop quartet singing. The lyrics are by Eben E. Rexford, and the music by Hart Pease Danks. Background Eben Eugene Rexford In 1930, an Associated Press story published in The New York Times gave some background on the writing of the lyrics of the song: > \\"Silver Threads Song Traced to Poet’s ‘Re-Hash’ on Order\\" Shiocton, Wis. > (AP).—The love ballad, “Silver Threads Among the Gold,” which has stirred > the hearts of more than one generation, was not the inspiration of an aging > poet but a “re-hash” produced on order. The story developed after the > unveiling of a monument here in honor of the author of the words, Eben E. > Rexford, who died in 1916. Rexford made a living by writing verse and flower > and garden articles for magazines. When he was 18, he wrote and sold for $3 > some verses entitled “Growing Old.” Later, H. P. Danks, composer of the > music for “Silver Threads,” wrote to him requesting words for a song. > Rexford dug into his scrapbook and revised “Growing Old.” The New York > Times, October 19, 1930, section 3, page 6 When Rexford spoke about the song, he explained that he worked his way through college by writing, and it was when he was in college that Danks sent him a request for lyrics, offering to pay three dollars for each song. Rexford submitted nine songs and received $18.00, but no accounting of which six had been accepted or which three had been rejected. In telling the story of the song, Rexford said that he didn't know whether he had been paid $3.00 for it or nothing, since he didn't know if it had been among the six accepted or the three rejected. Rexford first heard the song when a company of Oneida Indians gave a concert in Shiocton, Wisconsin, and sang it there.Hall, Jacob Henry (1914). Biography of Gospel Song and Hymn Writers. New York: Fleming H. Revell. pp. 257–258. The sheer popularity of the song can be illustrated, among other ways, by news stories which continued to reference it for many years. For example, in 1932, it won a poll of WABC (AM) (New York) listeners asked to name their favorite songs, despite its being 60 years old.(8 May 1932) Votes Cast by 6,000 Listeners Favor the Old Heart Songs; \\" Silver Threads Among the Gold,\\" Written in 1872, Tops List—Melody of 1840 Is Second, The New York Times.

Hoffmann Popular American recording pioneers, 1895-1925, p. 203-06 (2000) Later 20th-century recordings of the song include those of John McCormack, Bing Crosby (recorded November 8, 1947), Jerry Lee Lewis (1956 and 1973), Georg Ots (in Estonian and Finnish, 1958), Tapio Rautavaara (in Finnish, 1967) and Jo Stafford with Paul Weston's Orchestra and the Gaslight Singers (1969). Lyrics Hart Pease Danks The lyrics are as follows: :Darling, I am growing old, :Silver threads among the gold, :Shine upon my brow today, :Life is fading fast away. :But, my darling, you will be, :Always young and fair to me, :Yes, my darling, you will be :Always young and fair to me. :Chorus: :Darling, I am growing old, :Silver threads among the gold, :Shine upon my brow today; :Life is fading fast away. :When your hair is silver white, :And your cheeks no longer bright, :With the roses of the May, :I will kiss your lips and say, :Oh! My darling, mine alone, alone, :You have never older grown! :Yes, my darling, mine alone, :You have never older grown! ::chorus :Love can never more grow old, :Locks may lose their brown and gold; :Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, :But the hearts that love will know, :Never, never winter’s frost and chill; :Summer warmth is in them still; :Never winter’s frost and chill, :Summer warmth is in them still.Elson, Louis C., Ed.

In 1876, three years after the publication of the song, Mattie Dyers Britts published a story in Girls of Today entitled “Silver Threads Among the Gold.”Girls of Today, vol. 1, no. 24, May 13, 1876. *The metaphor of silver threads was used in an Italian song of the time, “Threads of Silver,” but the theme of that song is quite different from the theme of “Silver Threads Among the Gold.” In the Italian song, “Each thread of silver is a love once vainly plighted, . . . Each an illusion blighted, . . . Fated dreams undone.”Elson, Louis C., ed. (1918). Modern Music and Musicians for Vocalists. Vol. V. New York: University Society. pp. 1458–1459. *The Swedish journalist and revue producer Emil Norlander (1865–1935) wrote Swedish lyrics to Danks's melody in the early 20th century. Norlander's version has no contextual similarity to that of Rexford and is instead an appeal for peace. It is titled \\"Varför skola mänskor strida?\\" (Why should people fight?) and has remained popular in Sweden to the present, having been recorded by several well-known artists. *There were also Norwegian versions of the Rexford–Danks song that were popular in Norway and America.

On March 12, 2009, Gonsalves, Keith Stansell and Thomas Howes were each awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for the Defense of Freedom. Biography=Early life and education= Marc Gonsalves is the son of George Gonsalves and Jo Rosano. He was raised in Bristol, Connecticut and has a brother. =Career= Gonsalves served as an imagery analyst in the United States Air Force for eight years prior to becoming a contractor employed by California Microwave Systems, a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman. =Marriage and children= Gonsalves and his ex-wife, Alisa Shane, have three children. (One daughter and two stepsons) On July 17, 2008, Marc Gonsalves filed for divorce from his wife in Key West. Mission in Colombia Marc Gonsalves was part of a team of a dozen or so pilots and technicians overseen by the U.S. Southern Command. Their operation was dubbed the Southcom Reconnaissance System, and Northrop Grumman held the $8.6 million contract for the work. As the program became increasingly successful, several former pilots and others familiar with the program said civilian managers pushed flight crews farther over the jungles, often at night and sometimes 300 miles from their base. Their mission expanded, too, from locating targets in the illegal drug trade chosen by the American Embassy to keeping a lookout for leftist terrorist guerrillas, who also delved in the drug trade, including those of FARC. By 2002, pilots began to worry about what they perceived to be the lack of power and speed of their planes – the single-engine Cessna Caravan – for a country as big and mountainous as Colombia. Two pilots, Paul C. Hooper and Douglas C. Cocker, wrote letters in November and December 2002 to Northrop Grumman warning that flying single-engine planes was a recipe for disaster. The letters suggested that the Cessnas be replaced with twin-engine Beechcraft King Air 300s. The planes were not replaced, and the two pilots resigned. After two crashes, which temporarily halted the program, Northrop Grumman resumed the operation under a different name, the Colombia Surveillance System, using twin-engine planes. After the first crash, the program was transferred to a newly created company, CIAO Inc. Abduction Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell were on a drug surveillance mission in Colombia's cocaine-producing southern jungle when their single- engine Cessna plane crashed on February 13, 2003, in territory controlled by FARC. The American pilot, Tom Janis, and a Colombian army intelligence officer, Sgt. Luis Alcides Cruz, were led out by FARC gunmen and shot. The three surviving Americans (Gonsalves, Stansell and Howes) were forced to march with the guerrillas, deeper and deeper into the jungle. After this, the three Americans' exact location was lost by US intelligence. Three other Americans associated with Northrop Grumman made an attempt to find the hostages by air, but were all killed when their plane hit a tree. Then Colombian journalist Jorge Botero was allowed to contact the hostages and record a tape to prove that they were alive and well – and ready to be traded for imprisoned members of the FARC being held by the Colombian government.

The galley – which was rowed by oarsmen instead of using sail - had the distinction of serving the young American Navy for only a week before being scuttled after combat with the British.  American Revolution service  The galley built at the direction of Brigadier General Benedict Arnold at Skenesborough, New York, in 1776 for a fleet intended to impede British advance southward on Lake Champlain. Joining Arnold's fleet on 6 October 1776, Congress, and her crew of 80, served as flagship during the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain, fought on 11–13 October of that year. During the first day's lengthy engagement she fought valiantly, but suffered extensive damage to her hull, mast, and yards, at the hands of the vastly superior British force. On 12 October the American Continental Fleet, hopeful of further delaying the enemy as well as escaping to Crown Point, New York, slipped through the British line under cover of darkness, only to be overtaken the following day at Split Rock. In the ensuing engagement, Congress was so shattered that Arnold was obliged to run her ashore and set the ship ablaze. Although more than 20 of her crew were killed and Congress herself was destroyed, the mission of the ship and the fleet was accomplished. The British, their advance delayed until the season was too late for land operations, withdrew to Canada. The Americans used the time thus gained to equip and train the Army which defeated the next British invasion attempt, at Saratoga, New York, on 17 October 1777. This major victory was a most powerful factor, in influencing France to throw her might, including the large French Navy, on the side of the struggling young republic.

Scott first became known for his work as an electrifying stage actor with a piercing voice, and later as an innovative director of numerous productions throughout the country, from Broadway to the Tony Award-winning regional theatre, the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park, where he was the first African-American artistic director in the history of American regional theatre. Life and career Harold Scott (1959) Photograph by Carl Van Vechten Scott was born in Morristown, New Jersey. His mother was a housewife and his father, Harold Russell Scott Sr., was a general practitioner. Scott was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard. He had a career as a stage director on Broadway and Off Broadway, but began as an actor of note, performing in Jean Genet's The Blacks and an acclaimed production of the premiere of The Death of Bessie Smith by Edward Albee. Winner of the Obie Award for acting in Jean Genet's Deathwatch in 1959, Scott also played on Broadway in The Cool World. Scott was chosen by Elia Kazan to be an original member of the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, where he performed in Arthur Miller's After the Fall and Incident at Vichy, and was cast by José Quintero in Thomas Middleton's Changeling and in Eugene O'Neill's Marco Millions. In 1984, Scott returned to Off Broadway to play Brutus in a modern dress production of Shakespeare's Caesar with the Riverside Shakespeare Company at The Shakespeare Center under the direction of W. Stuart McDowell. Scott staged numerous innovative productions in New York and at regional theatres, including Morgan Freeman in The Mighty Gents on Broadway in 1978, and Avery Brooks in Paul Robeson on Broadway twice: in 1988 and again in 1995. Scott also directed the twenty-fifth anniversary production of A Raisin in the Sun, with Esther Rolle. This production opened at the Roundabout Theatre in New York; it then broke box-office records at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. Scott's production received nine National Theater Awards from the NAACP, including best director, and was filmed for public television's Great Performances. Scott was head of the directing program at the Mason Gross School of the Arts, at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. He also taught classes in acting at the Equity summer-stock theater The Peterborough Players, in Peterborough, NH in 1980, where he starred as Don Pedro in Much Ado About Nothing, appeared in A Streetcar Named Desire, and once filled in with only hours notice for a sick actor in Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday. He was extremely well-respected and beloved by his acting students there, who remember his unique and impressive training well due to his intense, insightful, caring personality. He then continued on at the Peterborough Players as Staff Director, 1981–85, Associate Director, 1985–88, and Acting Artistic Director, 1989-90. In February 2006, Scott directed his final play, Yellowman, an examination of black-on-black prejudice, at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park where, in 1973 he began a two-year appointment as artistic director. He was the first African-American to have earned such in a major regional theatre.

Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II. Because of this and other factors, Tokyo's current urban landscape is mostly modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce. Tokyo once was a city with low buildings and packed with single family homes, today the city has a larger focus on high rise residential homes and urbanization. Tokyo's culture is changing as well as increased risk of natural catastrophes, because of this architecture has had to make dramatic changes since the 1990s. Located off of Tokyo Bay which makes typhoons and rising sea levels a current risk, along with volcanoes and large earthquakes. As a result of this, a new focus has been placed on waterborne risks such as rising sea levels and seismic events. Tokyo has grown to over a half a million residents and the whole city has moved from its once central location to a more south-eastern part of the city. Tokyo in recent years has been growing at a steady rate, as a result it has had to build up, in order to get the most out what land it has. In recent years new tunnels for a hyperloop have been added between the two main shores of Kanagawa and Chiba Prefecture, in order to make commuting more efficient. Tokyo continues to advance in technology and grow, which will continue to change its architecture for years to come.  History of Japanese architecture  Tokyo Temple Japanese architects have designed a way to build temples, furniture, and homes without using screws or nails. To keep the piece together joints are constructed to hold everything in place. However, more time consuming, joints tend to hold up to natural disasters better than nails and screws, which is how some temples in Japan are still standing despite recent natural events. There are two main categories of Japanese buildings, craftsman-like and industrial. Industrial tends to be made by machines while the craftsman style is handmade and tends to take up more time than the industrial style. Japanese homes were influenced from China greatly until 57 BC, when Japanese homes started to grow to be more distinct from other cultures. Until 660 AD homes and building constructed in Japan were made from stone and timber. Even though all buildings from this era are long gone there are documents showing traditional structures. Contrary to this however, wood still remains the most important material in Japanese architecture.  Historic architects  Arata Isozaki * Arata Isozaki: Isozaki was born on July 23, 1931 in Kyushu, Japan. He studied architecture at the University of Tokyo. In 1963 he opened up his own studio and was the leading architect during the postwar period in Japan. Isozaki's first building he worked on was the Ōita Prefectural Library (1966). * Kenzo Tange: Tange was born on September 4, 1913. His best known work is the Hiroshima Peace Center and the 1964 Olympic games gymnasium. In Tokyo his design for the New Tokyo City Hall Complex made him a famous both local and internationally. Notable buildings Tokyo Skytree * Tokyo Skytree: One of the most famous buildings in Tokyo is the Skytree standing at 1,148 feet tall which makes it the second tallest building in the world and the world's largest free-standing tower. The main function of the Skytree is for telecommunications. The start of construction on the building started in 2008 and was finished in May 2012, the main architect on the project was the Nikken Sekkei firm. Today the tower is a popular tourist stop with its observation decks and restaurants located in the tower. * Tokyo Tower: Tokyo Tower is used as an observatory tower along with a broadcasting antenna. It is located in the Minato district within Tokyo, Japan. The tower was finished in 1958 and cost 2.8 Billion Yen. Standing at 1,092 feet tall, this is the second largest tower in Japan, right after the Tokyo Skytree. The tower was originally modeled off the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France; however, Tokyo tower is 13 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower. Tokyo Tower is painted in orange and white to comply with the air traffic in and out of Tokyo. This paint job, however, has to be repainted every 5 years. * Asakusa Kannon Temple: Built in 645 A.D, located in one of the most famous parts of Tokyo, Asakusa Kannon Temple is one of the oldest and most famous tourist destinations in Tokyo. This temple can be found in Asakusa district located in the center of Shitmachi. Dedicated to Bodhisattva Kannon, used for a Buddhist Temple and practices. Asakusa also hosts an annual festival called Sanja Matsuri. * Nakagin Capsule Tower: Built in 1972 by architect Kisho Kurokawa, the Nakagin Capsule Tower was built in only 30 days. Unlike other architecture that tower is built of removable cubes, each measuring to 107 feet, they are furnished with basic appliances, bathroom, and bed. Originally plans called to have each cube replaces every 25 years, however this proved to be too expensive. Since then residents have modified the cubes for different purposes, however the tower still home residents to this day. * Yoyogi National Gymnasium: Built for the 1964 Olympic games the Yoyogi National Gymnasium was finished a little over a month before the games started. The architect on the project was Kenzo Tange. The gymnasium was used for basketball and swimming competitions during the games.

It is the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Bjørgvin as well as the seat of the \\"Bergen domkirke\\" parish and the seat of the Bergen domprosti (arch-deanery). It is part of the Church of Norway. The first recorded historical reference to this church is dated 1181. It retains its ancient dedication to Saint Olaf. The cathedral seats about 900 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1181, when the peasant chief Jon Kutiza attacked King Sverre in Bergen. According to Sverris saga, some of Sverre's men then fled into the church (then known as Olavskirken because it was dedicated to Saint Olaf). At that time, the church was probably a regular parish church, but later, during the reign of King Haakon IV of Norway (1217–63), Franciscan monks must have taken over the church and built a friary by it. The medieval cathedral was instead Christ Church at Bergenhus Fortress, a medieval royal residence in Bergen. The first church built here had a long church design in the Romanesque style. The nave measured about and the choir was including the apse. Not much else is known about the first stone church on this site. The old church burned down in 1248 during a large city-wide fire and afterwards, a new stone church was built on the same site. Part of the north wall of the old church was salvaged and incorporated into the new church design. There was another fire in the church in 1270 and Magnus Lagabøte financed the repairs afterwards. In 1463, it burned down again, but it was not fully reconstructed until the 1550s. In 1537, it was decided that the church would be the new cathedral for the diocese to replace the old cathedral at Holmen which was demolished in 1531. Despite being declared the cathedral of the post-Reformation Protestant diocese, the church was not fully rebuilt after the fire in 1463. Bergen's first Protestant bishop, Gjeble Pederssøn, arranged for the completion of the church and it was completed before his death in 1557. After the fires of 1623 and 1640, Bergen Cathedral received its current general appearance. The steeple on the nave that was built by Bishop Pederssøn, was torn down, and the current tower on the west end was built. In 1702, there was an extensive renovation and restoration project that was undertaken after another city-wide fire. During the renovation in the 1880s, under the direction of architects Christian Christie and Peter Andreas Blix, the Rococo interiors were restored to their former medieval appearance. As part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, the 1665 Battle of Vågen took place in the main port area of Bergen. A cannonball from the sea battle between the English and Dutch fleets remains embedded in the cathedral's exterior wall. Music The present organ at Bergen Cathedral, by Rieger Orgelbau, is from 1997. The organ is the fifth one in the cathedral's history; the first known organ was installed in 1549. The cathedral is used regularly for musical concerts.

In 1821 Colburn recast the magazine with a more literary and less political focus, retitling it The New Monthly Magazine and Literary Journal. Nominally edited by the poet Thomas Campbell, most editing fell to the sub-editor Cyrus Redding. Colburn paid contributors well, and they included Sydney Morgan, Thomas Charles Morgan, Peter George Patmore, Mary Shelley, Charles Lamb, Leigh Hunt, Stendhal, Thomas Noon Talfourd, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Felicia Hemans, Ugo Foscolo, Richard Lalor Sheil, Mary Russell Mitford, Edward Bulwer, James and Horace Smith, and William Hazlitt.'Introduction', Wellesley Index to Periodical Literature; Higgins, The Literary Encyclopedia. Hazlitt's \\"Table-Talk\\" essays, begun in the London Magazine, appeared in the New Monthly from late 1821, his essay \\"The Fight\\" appeared in 1822,New Monthly Magazine Vol 3, 1822 page 102 at Google Books and his series \\"The Spirits of the Age'\\" was later republished, with essays from other sources, in the book The Spirit of the Age (1825).Higgins, The Literary Encyclopedia. Charles Knight's London Magazine merged with the New Monthly in 1829, and in that year Richard Bentley became Colburn's business partner. After Redding resigned in 1830, Campbell found himself unable to edit the magazine on his own and Samuel Carter Hall became editor for a year. In 1831 the novelist Edward Bulwer became editor, turning \\"the essentially apolitical, slightly Whiggish, literary journal into a vigorous radical organ shouting 'Reform' at the top of its lungs.\\"Introduction, Wellesley Index to Victorian Periodicals Hall, a political Conservative, had remained as sub-editor, and resisted Bulwer's efforts: Bulwer resigned in 1833, with Hall taking up the editorship once more. Contributors now included Catherine Gore, Anna Maria Hall, Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Felicia Hemans, Caroline Norton, Thomas Haynes Bayly, and Theodore Edward Hook. In 1837 the magazine was retitled The New Monthly Magazine and Humorist, to meet the challenge of Bentley's Miscellany. Now edited by Theodore Hook, it published contributions from Leigh Hunt, Douglas Jerrold, Frederick Marryat, Frances Trollope, Charles Robert Forrester, and W. M. Thackeray. Upon Hook's death in 1841, Thomas Hood was editor until 1843.'Introduction', Wellesley Index to Periodical Literature. According to the ODNB, the transcendentalist Francis Barham (1808–1871) edited the paper at around this time: \\"Two hundred pounds invested in the New Monthly Magazine procured him the joint editorship with John Abraham Heraud, the poet and dramatist. Anne Taylor, \\"Barham, Francis Foster (Alist Francis Barham) (1808–1871)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 4 January 2008. Heraud's ODNB entry has him editing the Monthly Magazine from 1839 to 1842, but does not mention the New Monthly. In 1845 Colburn sold the magazine for £2500 to William Harrison Ainsworth, who had earlier edited Bentley's Miscellany and who now edited his own Ainsworth's Magazine. Ainsworth edited the New Monthly with his cousin William Francis Ainsworth as sub-editor. From 1871–79 William Francis Ainsworth was editor. Titles Over the years, the magazine had several titles.

He was the highest-scoring member of a South African Air Force squadron during the war, credited with the destruction of 15 Axis aircraft. South African pilots with higher numbers of kills, such as Pat Pattle and Adolph \\"Sailor\\" Malan, were members of the British Royal Air Force. War time service Frost joined the South African Air Force (SAAF) in 1936, at the age of 18. By 1940 he had achieved the rank of captain, and was a member of No. 3 Squadron. =East African Campaign= In early 1941, the unit—flying Hawker Hurricaneshttp://samilitaryhistory.org/vol016dt.html—was dispatched to combat Italian forces during the East African Campaign. On 22 February 1941, Frost destroyed four Fiat CR.42 fighters, an action for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. On 15 March 1941, Frost was shot down by anti- aircraft fire while strafing Diredawa airfield. His wingman, Lieutenant Bob Kershaw landed his aircraft in a nearby field, while other 3 Sqn pilots fired on Italian infantry attempting to capture the pair. Kershaw escaped in his aircraft with Frost sitting on his lap, an action for which Kershaw was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.Tidy 1970 The campaign ended effectively in November 1941 with the final defeat of the Italian Forces in East Africa. The squadron returned to South Africa and was disbanded. =North African Campaign= Frost, promoted to major, was appointed commander of No. 5 Squadron, flying P-40 Kittyhawks. From March 1942 the squadron participated in the North African Campaign, with the Desert Air Force. No. 5 Squadron joined No. 2 and No. 4 Squadrons in No. 233 Wing; the main role of the SAAF fighters at the time was highly dangerous bomber escort missions, supporting No. 3 (Bomber) Wing SAAF. The squadron was assigned to the Sollum-Mersa Matruh sector. On 11 May, Frost and his wingman Lieutenant Ken Whyte shared the destruction of a lone Heinkel He 111 bomber attacking a convoy bound for Malta. Whyte described the action: \\"I remember our first combat together. While on a shipping patrol we were vectored on to a He 111. Jack made his favourite three-quarter attack which had brought him success in Abyssinia. I attacked from the rear. We each claimed half a share in its destruction.\\"Thomas 2005, p. 27. On 16 May, Frost destroyed a Junkers Ju 88, for his ninth victory, but was hit by cannon fire damaging his port elevator.Thomas 2005, p.33. On 28 May 1942, he was involved in a shared victory over a Messerschmitt Bf 109, his first. (The pilot, Feldwebel Willi Langer was killed.) At this stage, Frost's total tally stood at 15 Axis aircraft destroyed. Frost was appointed commander of No. 233 Wing on 31 May, but his replacement at 5 Squadron, Andrew Duncan, was shot down and killed by Oberleutnant Otto Schulz.Thomas 2005, p. 34.

Based on a story by Sy Bartlett, the film is about a princess who travels incognito to elope with her true love instead of marrying the man to whom she is betrothed. On the high seas, her ship is attacked by pirates who plan to kidnap her and hold her for ransom, unaware that she will be rescued by the unlikeliest of knights errant. Produced by Samuel Goldwyn, The Princess and the Pirate received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Music Score. Plot A pirate captain known as the Hook (Victor McLaglen) buries his treasure on an island and kills the map maker so no one else will find it. He and his cut-throat crew go after the Mary Ann, a ship on which Princess Margaret (Virginia Mayo) is running away from her father, the King (Robert Warwick), in order to marry a commoner. The Hook plans to hold her for a large ransom. A cowardly actor, Sylvester the Great (Bob Hope), is in the cabin next door to Margaret. The Hook's ship, The Avenger attacks the Mary Ann and after a big fight, the crew are killed or made to walk the plank by the pirates. Sylvester escapes by disguising himself as a gypsy woman and is taken on board The Avenger with Margaret. The Ship's aged tattooist, Featherhead (Walter Brennan) has taken a fancy to the gypsy which is all that saves the disguised Sylvester. It turns out that he guessed the gypsy was a man and involves Sylvester in his plot to get the Hook's treasure for himself. He gives him the treasure map and helps Sylvester and Margaret escape in a boat and they are to pass the stolen map to Featherhead's cousin on the pirate island of Casarouge. The couple make it to the island which is extremely bloodthirsty. The couple check in at the Boar's Head Inn where they are to meet the cousin (who at present is not on the island) and do an act at the Bucket of Blood to get some money to pay for their stay. Margaret is kidnapped and Sylvester goes to the Governor (La Roche) (Walter Slezak) to complain only to find out he was the kidnapper. La Roche has recognized Princess Margaret and plans on holding her for a million doubloon ransom. He stops Sylvester from leaving, planning to ransom him for 100,000 doubloons, sure that the King will want to hang him. Sylvester is well looked after and helps Margaret who is on a hunger strike. The Hook is in with La Roche and they threaten nasty things for the possessor of the map. Featherhead turns up under Sylvester's bed and knocks out Sylvester who wants to destroy the map to save his skin. Featherhead tattoos the map on the chest of the unconscious Sylvester and when he recovers, they both eat it. After a meeting, the Hook guesses Sylvester is the gypsy who stole the map and returns to the Governor's house to kill him. The Governor sees the map on Sylvester's chest as the Hook arrives. The Hook chases him but is stopped from killing Sylvester by Featherhead who shoots him. As he has not returned, Pedro (Marc Lawrence), the Hook's second-in-command leads a raid on the Governor's house to rescue the Hook and after a big fight, inadvertently rescues Sylvester who has disguised himself as the Hook, along with Margaret. Back on The Avenger, Sylvester as the Hook starts giving orders, not knowing that the real Hook has just been grazed by the bullet and is now also on the ship. Contradictory orders flow from the two different Hooks at different times, till Sylvester is unmasked. In chains and ready to kill themselves, The Avenger is attacked and they believe it is La Roche. It however turns out to be the King's ship and both are released (La Roche has been captured and has revealed all). The King says he is not going to stand in Margaret's way if she wants to marry a commoner and she rushes forwards. Sylvester is shocked as she passes him and into the arms of another man, Bing Crosby, who is playing a sailor. Indignantly, Sylvester says; \\"That is the last picture I do for Goldwyn\\" (which it was).

He has been the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut since February 2018. Durham had been an Assistant U.S. Attorney in various positions in the District of Connecticut for 35 years. He is known for leading an inquiry into allegations that FBI agents and Boston police had ties with the mob, and his role as special prosecutor in the 2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction. In May 2019, U.S. Attorney General William Barr tasked Durham with overseeing a review of the origins of the Russia investigation and to determine if intelligence collection involving the Trump campaign was \\"lawful and appropriate\\".  Education and volunteer work  Durham received a B.A. degree with honors from Colgate University in 1972. He received a J.D. degree in 1975 from the University of Connecticut School of Law. After graduation, he was a VISTA volunteer for two years (1975–1977) on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana.  Career = Connecticut state government = After Durham's volunteer work, he became a state prosecutor in Connecticut. From 1977 to 1978, he served as a Deputy Assistant State's Attorney in the Office of the Chief State's Attorney. From 1978 to 1982, Durham served as an Assistant State's Attorney in the New Haven State's Attorney's Office. = Federal government = Following those five years as a state prosecutor, Durham became a federal prosecutor, joining the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut. From 1982 to 1989, he served as an attorney and then supervisor in the New Haven Field Office of the Boston Strike Force in the Justice Department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section. From 1989 to 1994, he served as Chief of the Office's Criminal Division. From 1994 to 2008, he served as the Deputy U.S. Attorney, and served as the U.S. Attorney in an acting and interim capacity in 1997 and 1998. In December 2000, Durham revealed secret FBI documents that convinced a judge to vacate the 1968 murder convictions of Enrico Tameleo, Joseph Salvati, Peter J. Limone and Louis Greco because they had been framed by the agency. In 2007, the documents helped Salvati, Limone, and the families of the two other men, who had died in prison, win a $101.7 million civil judgment against the government. Durham also led a series of high-profile prosecutions in Connecticut against the New England Mafia and corrupt politicians, including former governor John G. Rowland. From 2008 to 2012, Durham also served as the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. On November 1, 2017, he was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as U.S. Attorney for Connecticut. On February 16, 2018, his nomination was confirmed by voice vote of the Senate. He was sworn in on February 22, 2018.  Appointments as special investigator = Whitey Bulger case = Amid allegations that FBI informants James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger and Stephen \\"The Rifleman\\" Flemmi had corrupted their handlers, US Attorney General Janet Reno named Durham special prosecutor in 1999. He oversaw a task force of FBI agents brought in from other offices to investigate the Boston office's handling of informants. In 2002, Durham helped secure the conviction of retired FBI agent John J. Connolly Jr., who was sentenced to 10 years in prison on federal racketeering charges for protecting Bulger and Flemmi from prosecution and warning Bulger to flee just before the gangster's 1995 indictment. Durham's task force also gathered evidence against retired FBI agent H. Paul Rico who was indicted in Oklahoma on state charges that he helped Bulger and Flemmi kill a Tulsa businessman in 1981. Rico died in 2004 before the case went to trial. = CIA interrogation tapes destruction = In 2008, Durham was appointed by Attorney General Michael Mukasey to investigate the destruction of CIA videotapes of detainee interrogations. On November 8, 2010, Durham closed the investigation without recommending any criminal charges be filed. Durham's final report remains secret but was the subject of an unsuccessful lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act filed by The New York Times reporter Charlie Savage. = Torture investigation = In August 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder appointed Durham to lead the Justice Department's investigation of the legality of CIA's use of so-called \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" in the torture of detainees. Durham's mandate was to look at only those interrogations that had gone \\"beyond the officially sanctioned guidelines\\", with Attorney General Holder saying interrogators who had acted in \\"good faith\\" based on the guidance found in the torture memos issued by the Bush Justice Department were not to be prosecuted. Later in 2009, University of Toledo law professor Benjamin G. Davis attended a conference where former officials of the Bush administration had told conference participants shocking stories, and accounts of illegality on the part of more senior Bush officials. Davis wrote an appeal to former Bush officials to take their accounts of illegality directly to Durham. A criminal investigation into the deaths of two detainees, Gul Rahman in Afghanistan and Manadel al-Jamadi in Iraq, was opened in 2011. It was closed in 2012 with no charges filed. = Investigation into origins of FBI investigation \\"Crossfire Hurricane\\"= In April 2019, Attorney General William Barr announced that he had launched a review of the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and it was reported in May that he had assigned Durham to lead it several weeks earlier. Durham was given the authority \\"to broadly examin[e] the government's collection of intelligence involving the Trump campaign's interactions with Russians,\\" reviewing government documents and requesting voluntary witness statements. On October 24, 2019, it was reported that what had been a review of the Russia investigation was now a criminal probe into the matter. The Justice Department could now utilize subpoena power for both witness testimony and documents. Durham also had at his disposal the power to convene a grand jury and file criminal charges, if needed. The New York Times reported on November 22 that the Justice Department inspector general had made a criminal referral to Durham regarding Kevin Clinesmith, an FBI attorney who had altered an email during the process of acquiring a wiretap warrant renewal on Carter Page, and that referral appeared to be at least part of the reason Durham's investigation was elevated to criminal status. On August 14, 2020, Clinesmith pleaded guilty to a felony violation of altering an email used to maintain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants. He changed an email to falsely add a claim that Page was \\"not a source\\" for the CIA, to a statement by the CIA liaison that Carter Page had a prior operational relationship with the CIA from 2008 to 2013.Kalmbacher, Colin. Here’s What We Know About ‘FBI Attorney 2’ Kevin Clinesmith, the First Person Charged in Durham Probe, Law & Crime, August 14, 2020. The day Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz released his report on the 2016 FBI Crossfire Hurricane investigation, which found the investigation was properly predicated and debunked a number of conspiracy theories regarding its origins, Durham issued a statement saying, \\"we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.\\" Many observers inside and outside the Justice Department, including the inspector general, expressed surprise that Durham would issue such a statement, as federal investigators typically do not publicly comment on their ongoing investigations. Barr also released a statement challenging the findings of the report. Horowitz later testified to the Senate that prior to release of the report he had asked Durham for any information he had that might change the report's findings, but \\"none of the discussions changed our findings.\\" The Washington Post reported that Durham could not provide evidence of any setup by American intelligence. The New York Times reported in December 2019 that Durham was examining the role of former CIA director John Brennan in assessing Russian interference in 2016, requesting emails, call logs and other documents. Brennan had been a vocal critic of Trump and a target of the president's accusations of improper activities toward him. The Times reported Durham was specifically examining Brennan's views of the Steele dossier and what he said about it to the FBI and other intelligence agencies. Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper had testified to Congress that the CIA and other intelligence agencies did not rely on the dossier in preparing the January 2017 intelligence community assessment of Russian interference, and allies of Brennan said he disagreed with the FBI view that the dossier should be given significant weight, as the CIA characterized it as \\"internet rumor.\\" The Times reported in February 2020 that Durham was examining whether intelligence community officials, and specifically Brennan, had concealed or manipulated evidence of Russian interference to achieve a desired result. FBI and NSA officials told Durham that his pursuit of this line of inquiry was due to his misunderstanding of how the intelligence community functions. Durham interviewed Brennan for eight hours on August 21, 2020, after which a Brennan advisor said Durham told Brennan he was not a subject or target of a criminal investigation, but rather a witness to events. The New York Times reported in September 2020 that Durham had also sought documents and interviews regarding how the FBI handled an investigation into the Clinton Foundation.  Accolades  In November 2011, Durham was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people.

The marks show the border between the Netherlands (NL) and Belgium (B), 2001. :For the music venue in New York City, see SideWalk Cafe. A sidewalk cafe or pavement cafe is \\"a portion of an eating or drinking place, located on a public sidewalk, that provides waiter or waitress service\\" (as defined by the American Planning Association based upon the New York City planning regulations); the area used solely for dining. Sidewalk cafes are of two types: enclosed and unenclosed, the former being surrounded by a 1-story structure and the latter being an area of the sidewalk that contains removable tables, chairs, and railings. Sidewalk cafes are common across Europe, forming an important part of street life in countries such as France and Italy. Sidewalk cafe outside an Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea coffee shop, Chicago, Illinois, 2007.  New York City  A sidewalk cafe on the Upper West Side in New York City, 2007 New York City regulations control in what areas sidewalk cafes can exist, their construction, and what parts of a sidewalk they can occupy. Proprietors pay a licence fee, which is effectively rent paid to the city for the use of the sidewalk. From 1988 these regulations were a zoning resolution of the city's Department of Planning. The 1988 resolution prohibited sidewalk cafes in residential areas and on major thoroughfares, permitting them in malls and (conditionally) \\"in Historic Districts or in designated Landmark Buildings\\". The stated purposes of the planning regulations are to balance the cafe proprietors' interests against the needs of pedestrians; to conserve the value of land; and to preserve the characters of neighborhoods. Until 2003 the process for obtaining a licence for a sidewalk cafe involved so many city agencies and such a long wait time that the law was regularly flouted, with restaurateurs considering it cheaper to just erect sidewalk cafes and pay the fines after the fact. New approval processes were adopted in that year, shortening the process to 140 days and making it the sole responsibility of the city's Department of Consumer Affairs. The COVID-19 pandemic in New York City forced restaurants to close their dining rooms. They received emergency permission to operate al fresco dining areas in streets.

Black Morrow, also known as Black Murray and Outlaw Murray, is the name given to a late 15th century Scottish outlaw. A popular ballad makes the bandit as living in Ettrick Forest, while a recorded oral tradition, a wood in Kirkcudbrightshire.\\"A such he seems to turn up again in Galloway where he haunts a forest of Kirkcudbrightshire, called Black Morrow wood, from which he sallies out 'in the neighboring country at night, committing horrible outrages.\\" (Child, 2003: 189) In the tradition, the outlaw is described as a Gypsy, Moor, a Saracen or, more commonly, an Irishman or from Ireland.http://www.araltas.com/features/clelland/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mymcclellandfamily/descendants_of_sir_william_m.htmThe history of Galloway: from the earliest period to the present time, by William Mackenzie\\"Sir George M'Kenzie, who died in 1691, has recorded a tradition that between 1452 and 1460 a company of Saracens or Gypsies from Ireland infested the country of Galloway, in Scotland, and the King promised the barony of Bombie to whomsoever should disperse them and bring in their captain dead or alive. The laird of Bombie's son, a Maclellan, killed the captain, and took his head on a sword to the king. Thereafter Maclellan took for his crest a Moor's head, and for a motto 'Think on'.\\" (Crofton, 1888) The folklorist David MacRitchie took a strong interest in the ethnicity of the outlaw because of his dark skin, and the story is commonly quoted in modern Afrocentrist literature. Others however (e.g. John Mactaggart) have disputed whether the bandit was dark skinned, or a \\"Blackimore\\". Written sources The story as a ballad, appears as \\"An Old Song Called Outlaw Murray\\" in the Glenriddel Manuscripts (XI, 61) published in 1791. It also appears in Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, a collection of ballads compiled by Walter Scott (1803). Aytoun's Ballads of Scotland (1859) in a note appended to the ballad mentions an earlier manuscript: \\"written between the years 1689 and 1702\\" which contains the song. While the latter manuscript is presumed lost, \\"it is clear that the ballad was known before 1700; how much earlier it is to be put we can neither ascertain nor safely conjecture\\".Child, 2003: 185. According however to Scott, the ballad or dancing song \\"appears to have been composed about the reign of James V\\", while the story itself takes place during the late 15th century.\\"It is true that the dramatis personae introduced seem to refer to the end of the fifteenth or beginning of the sixteenth century.\\" (Child, 2003: 187) Note that the ballad doesn't describe the bandit as a Gypsy, Saracen or Moor, nor even as Black Murray, only as Outlaw Murray. A different story related to the balladChild, 2003: 189. is found in Crawford's The Peerage of Scotland (1716) who mentions George Mackenzie, as having written down an oral tradition in 1680. Unlike the ballad, the tradition describes the bandit as a Moor, who was accompanied by Saracens: Crawford considered this band of Saracens and Moors, to be Gypsies, despite Mackenzie not describing them as such.\\"From these accounts, then, it appears that a tradition was prevalent in Galloway two centuries ago, according to which that district had been ravaged, two centuries earlier, by a band of Moors or Saracens, styled 'Gypsies' by a writer of the year 1716.\\" (MacRitchie, 1894: 22) =Black Murray= It remains unclear when Outlaw Murray began to be called Black Murray (Black Morrow) because neither does the recorded tradition call him this; the folklorist David MacRitchie in 1894 traced the name Black Murray to two literary sources (the earliest from 1824), arguing they were local Kirkcudbrightshire versions of the original Mackenzie/Crawford tradition: The author of The History of Galloway (1841) suggests Morrow or Murray is a corruption of Moor, \\"who from his swarthy complexion was called Black Morrow\\".The History of Galloway, From the Earliest Period to the Present Time, archive.org. However, in the ballad, Murray is the surname of the bandit which is unlikely to have derived in etymology from the word Moor. The meaning and origin of \\"Black\\" is also disputed (see below). Story The ballad is different to the Mackenzie/Crawford tradition, although both take place during the late 15th century and the outlaw, or bandit, lives in a Scottish forest (but in the ballad, the outlaw owns an entire stronghold in the woodland). Both are also connected to the names Murray, or Morrow. Walter Scott describes the Outlaw Murray of the ballad: \\"as a man of prodigious strength, possessing a batton or club, with which he laid lee (i.e. waste) the country for many miles round\\". This closely resembles the bandit of the Mackenzie/Crawford tradition, but the forest of the ballad is Ettrick Forest, not a wood in Kirkcudbrightshire. Another difference is that in the Mackenzie/Crawford tradition, the bandit is slain by a Maclellan clansman (i.e. William Maclellan), but in the ballad the bandit is not murdered. In a local Kirkcudbrightshire version, MacLellan deliberately replaced spring-water in a well with spirits in order to get bandit drunk. MacLellan is said to have murdered the outlaw for a £50 reward and carried his head to the King; the head became a family crest as a Moor's head.Crofton, 1888. Origin of \\"Black\\" in name The word \\"Black\\" in Black Murray (Black Morrow) via the early 19th century local Kirkcudbrightshire versions of the tradition, derives from either: * The dark skin complexion of the Moor bandit (hence the terms \\"Blackimore\\" and \\"Blackamoor\\"). * The name of the wood where the outlaw lived in Kirkcudbrightshire: \\"Black Morrow (Plantation)\\". * The crimes, evil nature or grim personality of the bandit. MacRitchie argued for the first view, and that the outlaw was dark skinned. In contrast John Mactaggart who popularized the story in his The Scottish Gallovidian Encyclopedia (1824) argued Black Murray derived his name from his bad deeds (analogous to \\"Black Douglas\\") and not swarthy skin, going as far to deny the bandit was ever a Moor in the first place: The bandit as a dark skinned Moor or Saracen, could though explain the Moor's head that appears on the crest of the Arms of Lord Kirkcudbright, and in consequence the modern crest badge used by Clan MacLellan (the blazon for which is an arm supporting on the point of a sword, a Moor's head). Yet another theory links the bandit to the name of the Kirkcudbrightshire wood he lived of the same name (Black Morrow Plantation), but it could alternatively be argued the wood took its name from the outlaw, rather than vice versa.

The service broadcast Chicago Blackhawks games. It operated in conjunction with Chicago's local version of SportsChannel, and access cost $29.95 per month. Overview In 1992, Wirtz, who had a reputation for stubbornness and frugality, ended all Blackhawks broadcast agreements with network and cable television outlets. While vilified for this decision by many Blackhawks fans, he felt that broadcasting regular home games was unfair to the team's season-ticket holders. Only Blackhawks games picked up by national broadcasters (which only happened when the Blackhawks made the playoffs) were shown on basic cable (complicated further by SportsChannel America having various issues with carriage). Hawkvision only broadcast for a short time, ending after the season. However, regular Blackhawk home games did not resume airing on television until the season after Wirtz's death. His son Rocky took over the team's operations and agreed to allow WGN-TV and NBC Sports Chicago to carry those games.

Known for spontaneous and eccentric teaching, he sometimes said that he preferred to teach laypeople because monks were too lazy to practice hard. Kobong never held a position at any temple or established a temple of his own. When he was elderly, his student Seungsahn brought him to Hwagyesa in Seoul, South Korea where Kobong died at the temple in 1962. A large granite monument was built in his honor on the hillside overlooking Hwagyesa. Lineage Kobong Sunim was Dharma heir to Mangong Sunim, who was in turn Dharma heir to Kyongho Sunim. Kobong Sunim's best known student was Seungsahn Sunim (1927–2004), founder of the Kwan Um School of Zen. Seungsahn Sunim received Dharma transmission from Kobong Sunim at 22 years of age.

Population sizes can comprise millions of individuals and in a cave there can be one to 15 bugs per bat. It was estimated that adult African bat bugs feed approximately once per week thus withdrawing 1-28 microlitre blood per day per bat.K. Reinhardt, R. Naylor, M. Siva-Jothy, Estimating the mean abundance and feeding rate of a temporal ectoparasite in the wild: Afrocimex constrictus (Heteroptera: Cimicidae). International Journal for Parasitology, Vol 37, pp. 937-942, July 2007 As in many other cimicids, Afrocimex constrictus reproduce through traumatic insemination. During mating, the male pierces the female's abdomen with his genitals, and ejaculates into her body cavity, into a special organ called the spermalege. While females do have external genitalia, they are used for egg laying but not for mating.R. L. Usinger, Monograph of the Cimicidae (Hemiptera-Heteroptera). The Thomas Say Foundation Vol 7, Entomological Society of America, 1966 Afrocimex constrictus males also pierce and inseminate other males. Male-male stabbings were originally probably harmful to males and so it was speculated that male-male stabbings were the reason that Afrocimex constrictus males have - like females - evolved a spermalege. The male spermalege looks similar but not identical to the typical female spermalege and males receive fewer stabbings than females.K. Reinhardt, E. Harney, R. Naylor, M. Siva-Jothy, Female-limited polymorphism in the copulatory organ of a traumatically inseminating insect. American Naturalist, Vol 170, pp. 931-935, December 2007 In one cave around 80% of the females were found to mimic the male version of the spermalege and such females receive fewer stabbings from males than females that have the original spermalege type. The species also had a brief appearance in fiction. In French writer Bernard Werber's novel Le Jour des fourmis (1997), the mating habits of A. constrictus are employed in the torture chambers of the ants.

Covering , the landmarked area is partly private property and partly in John Muir Memorial County Park, a minimally developed public park. Description and history John Muir came to the United States in 1849 as an eleven-year- old immigrant with his father, who established a farm in Marquette County, Wisconsin. The farm property, later expanded to , in what was essentially undeveloped wilderness, would play a significant role in developing the young Muir's appreciation of nature and the development of his conservation ethic.

Club career McNeill attended Belfast High School and signed with Crusaders as a 15 year-old. He made an early impact with the Crues, helping them to some of their earliest trophy successes and played seven times in Amateur internationals. In October 1963 he scored the only goal against Glenavon in the Ulster Cup final replay. In 1967 he was amongst the scorers as the Crues handed out a surprise defeat to Glentoran in the Irish Cup Final. That summer he joined up with the Glens squad that travelled as the Detroit Cougars to compete in the USA Eastern Division. In 1967 McNeill, who had previously been watched by Newcastle United and Leeds United, transferred to Middlesbrough shortly after returning from the US. He had to wait until mid-way through the 1967/68 season to make his Second Division debut, in a 1-0 win at Aston Villa. Despite his versatility - he could play either as a forward or as a defensive midfielder - McNeill played just four times for Boro. He did earn inclusion in the Northern Ireland Under-23 squad, coming off the bench in a 1-0 win over Wales at Swansea. Early in the 1968/69 season McNeill was allowed to join Huddersfield Town, but it wasn't until he joined Oldham Athletic in October 1969 that he made a significant impact on League football. By then a strongly built and hard-working attacking midfielder, he made an immediate impact at Boundary Park. He helped the team turn around a nine game run without a win and in 1970/71 aided the Latics to promotion from the Fourth Division. Injuries limited McNeill to just thirteen starts and five appearances from the bench during Oldham's 1973/74 Division Three championship campaign. He left Boundary Park in 1975 for Stockport County before drifting into non-league football two seasons later. He continued to pull on his boots in the Huddersfield League until the age of 46.

It was originally owned at the turn of the 20th century by Don Vicko Orlandini (Don Vincenzo Orlandini), who was a member of one of Bolivia's famous tin mining families, and also owner of El Porvenir- Cataricahua, in Huanuni, Oruro, Bolivia. The Huanuni mine was later sold to Simón Iturri Patiño, the well-known tin baron. The Catavi mine was, at one point, the largest underground tin mine in the world, especially from 1930 to the late 1940s. At about that time the Huanuni mine took Catavi\`s place through the end of the 20th century. Thousands of Bolivian mine workers still go underground every day. The mine was discovered by chance in the 19th century, and was mined for a long time simply with the aid of simple tools; the means of transport were burros (donkeys). In traditional mining methods, the average lifespan of a mine worker from the local community was traditionally 46 years. That has now changed dramatically. Lifespan and pay have increased dramatically. Mine workers in Bolivia earn good wages today and average lifespan has increased to over 60 years.

By 1677 her armament had been increased to 48 guns. Construction Advice was one of six frigates ordered by the Commonwealth of England in 1649. Her design was proposed to be modeled on that of two 1647 vessels then in active service, and . On 4 January 1650, the Admiralty Committee reached agreement with master shipwright Peter Pett to construct the vessel under private contract at Woodbridge docks, for a fee of £6.10d a ton. Initial plans were for a vessel of 34 guns with a keel and beam, measuring 511 tonnes burthen. Her crew complement was set at 150 men.Winfield 2009, p. 95 Construction commenced in early 1650. As built, Advice measured over the agreed 100 foot keel, with a hold depth of . her final measurement slightly exceeded the contracted amount, at 516 tonnes burthen. The Admiralty fee for the vessel split the difference between the contract amount and the final size, paying £6.10d a ton on 513 tonnes for a total purchase price of £3,334.10d. The frigate was formally named Advice on 16 August 1650. Navy Service=First Anglo Dutch War= Active was commissioned by the Commonwealth in late 1650, for service off the west coast of England. Her first captain, George Dakins, served aboard until the end of 1652, when he was succeeded by John Day. In early 1653 Advice was formally attached to the British fleet under Admiral Robert Blake for service in the First Anglo-Dutch War, and was involved in most major sea battles of the conflict, commencing with the inconclusive Battle of Portland in February 1653. By mid-1653 Captain Day had been replaced by Captain Jeremiah Smith, who was in command when Advice sailed as part of Blake's reinforcement of the British fleet at the Battle of the Gabbard on 3 June. Advice was assigned to the Centre Division of Britain's Red Squadron under the direct control of General-at-Sea George Monck. In this position she joined the line of battle against the Dutch fleet but is not recorded to have suffered damage from enemy fire. Advice was not present at the final major naval engagement of the War, the Battle of Scheveningen in July 1653. Late in that year her command transferred from Jeremiah Smith to Captain Francis Allen. After Scheveningen the Dutch Navy no longer sought direct engagement with the British at sea. Advice was instead assigned to patrolling the Dutch shoreline to interfere with merchant shipping. She held this station over the winter of 1653 and into the new year; the War itself ended four months later with the Treaty of Westminster in July 1654. =Later service= She underwent a rebuild in 1698 at Woolwich Dockyard, from where she was relaunched as a fourth-rate ship of the line of between 46 and 54 guns. On 27 June 1711, while lying in Yarmouth Roads, Advice was attacked by five privateers flying French colours. The French ships lay off Advice's quarter, relieving each other as necessary, and caused a great deal of damage to the sails and rigging. Despite their resistance, Captain Lord Duffus was forced to surrender after two thirds of his crew had been killed or wounded, and he having taken a total of five musket balls to various parts of his body. The privateers took Advice back to Dunkirk.Ships of the Old Navy, Advice (1650).

With Montenegro's secession from the union with Serbia in 2006, both became sovereign states in their own right for the first time in nearly 88 years.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/serbia-ends-union-with- montenegro-1.785687 After the League of Communists of Yugoslavia collapsed in 1990, the Socialist Republic of Serbia led by Slobodan Milošević's Socialist Party (formerly the Communists) adopted a new constitution, declaring itself a constituent republic with democratic institutions within Yugoslavia, and the \\"Socialist\\" adjective was dropped from the official title. As Yugoslavia broke up, in 1992 Serbia and Montenegro formed a new federative state called the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, known after 2003 as simply Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia claimed that it was not involved in the Bosnian or Croatian wars. However, the Serb rebel entities both sought direct unification with Serbia. SAO Krajina and later the Republic of Serbian Krajina sought to become \\"a constitutive part of the unified state territory of the Republic of Serbia\\".Prosecutor v. Milan Martić Judgement. p. 46. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Accessed 13 September 2009. (On 16 March 1991 another referendum was held which asked: \\"Are you in favor of the SAO Krajina joining the Republic of Serbia and staying in Yugoslavia with Serbia, Montenegro and others who wish to preserve Yugoslavia?\\". With 99.8% voting in favor, the referendum was approved and the Krajina assembly declared that \\"the territory of the SAO Krajina is a constitutive part of the unified state territory of the Republic of Serbia\\".) The Republika Srpska's political leader Radovan Karadžić declared that he did not want it to be in a federation alongside Serbia in Yugoslavia, but that Srpska should be directly incorporated into Serbia.Daily Report: East Europe, Issues 191-210. Front Cover United States. Foreign Broadcast Information Service. Pp. 38. (A recorded conversation between Branko Kostic and Srpska's President Radovan Karadzic, Kostic asks whether Karadzic wants Srpska to be an autonomous federal unit in federation with Serbia, Karadzic responds by saying that he wants complete unification of Srpska with Serbia as a unitary state similar to France). While Serbia acknowledged both entities' desire to be in a common state with Serbia, both entities chose the path of individual independence and so the Serbian government did not recognize them as part of Serbia, or within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Although Serbia managed—at least nominally—to stay out of the Yugoslav wars until 1998 when the Kosovo War broke out, the 1990s were marked by an economic crisis and hyperinflation, the Yugolav wars, a refugee crisis, and the authoritarian rule of Slobodan Milošević. After the opposition came to power in 2000, Serbia (viewed in the international community differently from Montenegro whose leadership had become a western outpost since 1998) began its transition in reconciliation with western nations, a decade later than most other east European countries. As a result of this change, Yugoslavia began to slowly re-integrate itself internationally following a period of isolation caused by sanctions that were now gently easing. Background With the collapse of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in 1992, the two remaining constituent republics of Serbia and Montenegro agreed to form a new Yugoslav state which officially abandoned communism in favor of forming a new Yugoslavia based upon democratic institutions (although the republic retained its communist coat of arms). This new rump Yugoslavia was known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The Socialist Republic of Serbia became known as the Republic of Serbia in 1990 after the League of Communists of Yugoslavia collapsed, though former Communist politicians would exercise influence for the first ten years, as the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia was directly descended from the League of Communists of Serbia. Serbia appeared to be the dominant republic in the FRY given the vast size and population differences between the republics; internally, however, the two entities functioned independently while with regard to foreign affairs, the federal government had comprised Montenegrins as well as Serbians. History=Federation= Slobodan Milošević, President of Serbia from 1989 to 1997 and President of Yugoslavia from 1997 to 2000. Zoran Đinđić, Prime Minister of Serbia from 2001 to 2003. The politics of Serbia in the FRY continued to support Serbian interests in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia whose Serb populations wanted to remain in Yugoslavia. Since 1989, Serbia had been led by Slobodan Milošević, a former Communist who promised to defend and promote Serb interests in Yugoslavia. In 1992, he and Montenegrin President Momir Bulatović formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Many critics on the international stage saw Serbia as the dominant internal unit of the FRY, in which Serbian President Milošević seemed to have more influence on federal politics than the Yugoslav President (the first federal president, Dobrica Ćosić was forced to resign for opposing Milošević). The Milosevic government did not have official territorial claims on the Republic of Macedonia. Others have claimed that Milosevic only advocated self- determination of self-proclaimed Serbs who wished to remain in Yugoslavia. During the Yugoslav Wars in Croatia and Bosnia & Herzegovina, Milošević supported Serb separatists who wished to secede from these newly created states. This support extended to controversial figures such as Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić, and accusations by some international figures claimed that Milošević was in charge of the Serb factions during the war and had authorized war atrocities to occur. In 1995, Milošević represented the Bosnian Serbs during the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Milošević continued to be President of Serbia until 1997 when he retired as Serbian President in 1997 and became Yugoslav President. Milan Milutinović took over as Serbian President from Milošević that year. From 1996 to 1999, severe political instability erupted in the Albanian-populated province of Kosovo in Serbia. This caused the Kosovo War and in 1999, Serbia and Montenegro were bombed by NATO aircraft which included the Serbian and federal capital of Belgrade. Afterward, Belgrade agreed to relinquish control of the province of Kosovo to a United Nations autonomous mandate. The Yugoslav Wars resulted in a failing economy in Serbia and anger at the federal presidency of Milošević. The wars and their aftermath saw the rise of Serbian ultranationalist parties, such as the Serbian Radical Party led by Vojislav Šešelj, who in his rhetoric, promoted the idea of Serbs continuing to live in a single state. Šešelj participated in the ethnic Serbian campaign against Croats and Bosniaks during the Yugoslav Wars. Šešelj was twice arrested in 1994 and 1995 by the Yugoslav government, but eventually became Vice-President of Serbia from 1998 to 2000. In 2000, Serbian citizens protested against elections when Milošević refused to stand down from the Yugoslav Presidency following elections as allegations of voter fraud existed. Milošević was ousted on October 5, 2000, and officially resigned the following day. He was later arrested in 2001 by federal authorities for alleged corruption whilst in power but was soon transferred to The Hague to face war crimes charges. After the overthrow of Milošević, Vojislav Koštunica became the President of Yugoslavia. In 2002, Milošević's ally, Serbian President Milutinović resigned, thus ending twelve years of some form of the political leadership of the Socialist Party of Serbia over the republic. Boris Tadić of the Democratic Party replaced Milutinović. =Confederation= In 2003, following the new confederation. Serbia became one of the constituent states within it along with Montenegro. The confederacy arose as Montenegrin nationalism was growing. Montenegro had for some years used external currency as legal tender, this began with the German Mark, and since 2002, became the Euro. Serbia, however continued to use the Yugoslav Dinar, and the national bank of Yugoslavia. Serbia's attachment to the confederation would be its final subordination until its independence was declared in 2006 following Montenegro's declaration of independence from the confederation following a referendum on independence shortly prior. Between 2003 and 2006, Serbia was faced with internal political strife over the direction of the republic, Serbian politicians were divided over the decision to create the loose state union in the first place. Zoran Đinđić who was seen as a major proponent of the state union was criticized by the former Yugoslav President Vojislav Koštunica. The anger of nationalists over Đinđić's positions resulted in a sudden assassination in March 2003 which caused a state of emergency to be declared. In 2004, pro-European Union political forces united against nationalist forces who opposed Serbia's entry into the EU until the EU recognized Serbia's sovereignty in Kosovo. In 2006, Serbia faced the implications of a referendum on independence from the state union by Montenegro. Most Serbians wished to keep Montenegro in a state union due to the previous close ties which the two nations had and that Montenegrins were considered in Serbia to be the same as Serbs culturally and ethnically. Despite a hard-fought campaign by pro-unionists, pro-independence forces narrowly won the referendum with just over the 55 per cent threshold demanded by the European Union. With Montenegro's independence granted, Serbia declared itself an independent state, the first time it had been so since 1918. This also ended an almost 88-year union between Montenegro and Serbia. Economy=Sanctions= Throughout most of the 1990s and early-2000s sanctions were held against Serbia.

It lives in spruce forest clearings, glades, slopes, subalpine meadows and damp meadows at an elevation of above sea level. Description Erebia euryale has a wingspan of 20–23 mm. These butterflies have a considerable geographic variation.Frans Cupedo Reproductive isolation and intraspecific structure in Alpine populations of Erebia euryale (Esper, 1805) (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae, Satyrinae) Usually the upperside of the forewings is dark brown with a reddish-orange postmedian band marked with three or four oval ocelli, with white pupils in the females, often blind or reduced to small dots in the males. All wings show chequered fringes. The forewings of the males do not show androconial area. The upperside of each hindwing usually has three eyespots surrounded by orange. The underside hindwings of the females shows a diffuse clear or whitish band, strongly dentate. The caterpillar and the chrysalis are pinkish brown. This species is rather similar to Erebia ligea. Biology This species is univoltine. It overwinters a first year as an egg, a second year as a caterpillar. The eggs, pearly grey, hatch in the spring. Adults fly from June to September. They feed at mountain flowers, specially at yellow daisies. Caterpillars feed on various grasses (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Brachypodium sylvaticum, Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca ovina, Festuca rubra, Festuca alpina, Poa nemoralis, Carex flacca, Digitaria, Milium, Carex and Sesleria species).Pyrgus.de Bibliography *A.

It was written in 1835 and published in 1837. It tells the story of a statue of Venus that comes to life and kills the son of its owner, whom it believes to be its husband. Plot summary The narrator, an archeologist, is visiting the town of Ille in the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France. A friend of his recommends him to M. de Peyrehorade, who is familiar with the Roman ruins in the area. When he arrives, he discovers that M. de Peyrehorade's son, Alphonse, is to be married to a certain Mademoiselle de Puygarrig, and the narrator is invited to the wedding. A marble statue of Venus similar to the bronze described in Prosper Mérimée's Vénus d'Ille Meanwhile, M. de Peyrehorade shows the narrator his new discovery: a bronze statue of Venus Pudica. The narrator judges the statue to be very old and deciphers the inscription. Both men marvel at her fierce gaze; she is as frightening as she is beautiful. She also seems to be cursed: the man who found her had his leg broken, and another man who threw a stone at her was injured by the stone rebounding and striking him. Before the wedding, the groom decides to play a game of Paume, and he slips the wedding ring intended for his fiancée onto a finger of the statue. He wins the game, but his opponents swear revenge. He accidentally leaves the ring with the statue; and when he goes back later to retrieve it, he discovers that the statue has closed her fingers around it. The narrator does not believe Alphonse's story, since Alphonse has been drinking heavily at the reception, and he goes to bed. During the night, the narrator hears heavy footsteps climbing the stairs; but he assumes that it is a drunken Alphonse going to bed. In the morning, after the cock's crow, he hears the same steps retreating down the stairs. Suddenly, there is screaming and commotion. The narrator runs down the hall to find a crowd of people surrounding the dead Alphonse, who looks as though he died in a fiery embrace. At first, he suspects that it was the rival faction from the game of Paume; but later he hears the story of Alphonse's wife, who others claim has gone crazy. She says that the statue entered the room, embraced her husband, and spent the entire night with him in her arms. In the morning, the statue left him there and returned to her pedestal. The narrator leaves town to return to Paris. He later hears that M. de Peyrehorade has died, and his wife had the statue melted down and turned into a bell for the local church. The narrator remarks that since the bell has been installed, the crops have been destroyed twice by frost.

Due to western dominance of the world, this has become the common world calendar system, though many cultures separately maintain their own calendars based on various events. Recently, the terms Common Era (CE) and Anno Mundi (AM) have come into use. *Anointing - ritual act of pouring aromatic oil over a person's head or entire body. By extension, the term is also applied to related acts of sprinkling, dousing, or smearing a person or object with any perfumed oil, milk, butter, or other fat. *Antichrist - in Christian eschatology, the Antichrist or anti-Christ is someone recognized as fulfilling the Biblical prophecies about one who will oppose Christ and substitute himself in Christ's place. *Antilegomena - an epithet used by the Church Fathers to denote those books of the New Testament which, although sometimes publicly read in the churches, were not — for a considerable amount of time — considered to be genuine, or received into the canon of Scripture. They were thus contrasted with the \\"Homologoumena\\" (from Greek ομολογουμένα), or universally acknowledged writings *Antinomianism - in theology, is the idea that members of a particular religious group are under no obligation to obey the laws of ethics or morality, and that salvation is by predestination only *Apocalypse - any prophetic revelation or so-called End Time scenario, or to the end of the world in general *Apostasy - (from Greek αποστασία, meaning a defection or revolt, from απο, apo, \\"away, apart\\", στασις, stasis, \\"standing\\") is a term generally employed to describe the formal abandonment or renunciation of one's religion, especially if the motive is deemed unworthy. In a technical sense, as used sometimes by sociologists without the pejorative connotations of the word, the term refers to renunciation and criticism of, or opposition to, one's former religion *Apostle - (', apostolos, \\"someone sent out\\", e.g. with a message or as a delegate) were, according to the Synoptic Gospels and Christian tradition, disciples (followers) whom Jesus of Nazareth had chosen, named, and trained in order to send them on a specific mission. *Apostolic Age - traditionally the period of the Twelve Apostles, dating from the Crucifixion of Jesus (c. 26–36) and the Great Commission until the death of John the Apostle *Apostolic Decree - See Council of Jerusalem *Aramaic - believed to be the primary language of Jesus. *Ascension of Jesus - a Christian doctrine that says Jesus ascended to heaven in the presence of his Eleven Apostles following his resurrection, and that in heaven he sits at the right hand of God the Father *Atonement - a doctrine found within both Christianity and Judaism. It describes how sin can be forgiven by God. In Judaism, Atonement is said to be the process of forgiving or pardoning a transgression. This was originally accomplished through rituals performed by a High Priest on the holiest day of the Jewish year: Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). In Christian theology the atonement refers to the forgiving or pardoning of sin through the crucifixion of Jesus Christ which made possible the reconciliation between God and man. Within Christianity there are numerous technical theories for how such atonement might work, including the ransom theory, the Abelardian theory, the substitutionary atonement theory with its variations, and the Anselmian satisfaction theory. B *Baptism - rite of admission and adoption, almost invariably with the use of water, into Christianity. *Bauer lexicon - the standard English lexicon of Biblical Greek. *Bible - a collection of writings by early Christians, believed to be mostly Jewish disciples of Christ, written in first-century Koine Greek. Among Christian denominations there is some disagreement about what should be included in the canon, primarily about the Apocrypha, a list of works that are regarded with varying levels of respect. *Beelzebub - a name derived from a Philistine god, formerly worshipped in Ekron, and later adopted by some Abrahamic religions as a major demon. *Blood of Christ - A reference to (a) the actual blood of Jesus when he was sacrificed on the cross (cf. Luke 22:19, 20); and/or (b) the spiritual covering that that sacrifice of Jesus on the cross provides for sin and our sanctification, i.e., \\"That's covered by the blood of Christ.\\". *Body of Christ - A reference to (a) the Christian church as a whole, worldwide (cf. 1 Corinthians 12:12–14 and Ephesians 4:1–16), and/or (b) a name for the bread used in Communion/Eucharist to represent the physical body of Jesus sacrificed on the cross (cf. Luke 22:19, 20). *Born again (Christianity) – particularly in evangelicalism, \\"spiritual rebirth\\", or a regeneration of the human spirit from the Holy Spirit, contrasted with physical birth. *Born-again virgin - A person who, after having engaged in copulation, makes some type of commitment not to be sexually active again until marriage (or some other defined point in the future, or indefinitely) C *Cafeteria Christianity *Charismania *Christ - the English term for the Greek word (Christós), which literally means \\"The Anointed One.\\" The Hebrew word for Christ is מָשִׁיחַ (Mašíaḥ, usually transliterated Messiah). The word may be misunderstood by some as being the surname of Jesus due to the frequent juxtaposition of Jesus and Christ in the Christian Bible and other Christian writings.

Reid et al., Dictionary of Christianity in America (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1990) It is an over-emphasis of discipline of conduct, or legal ideas, usually implying an allegation of misguided rigour, pride, superficiality, the neglect of mercy, and ignorance of the grace of God or emphasizing the letter of law at the expense of the spirit. Legalism is alleged against any view that obedience to law, not faith in God's grace, is the pre-eminent principle of redemption. *Letter and spirit of the law *Leviticus 18 - the section of scripture usually cited during debates about homosexuality. *Logos - ( logos, that is, \\"word\\", \\"discourse\\" or \\"reason\\" i.e., rationality or reasoning) is a name or title of Jesus Christ, seen as the pre-existent Second Person of a Trinitarian God.

As are all covenants between God and man described in the Bible, it is \\"a bond in blood sovereignly administered by God.\\" This definition of covenant is from O.

Matthew McMahon. *New Jerusalem *New Testament (sometimes called the \\"new covenant\\") - translation of the Greek καινή διαθήκη. Western Christianity so names its Greek scriptures to distinguish them from the Hebrew scriptures (\\"Old Testament\\"). It consists of \\"Gospels,\\" Epistles, and the Apocalypse (Revelation). The term (new covenant) comes from 1 Cor. 11:25 and its parallel (Luke 22:20) in which Jesus institutes the Christian eucharist. *New Wine into Old Wineskins *Nicene Creed *Number of the Beast O *Oblate *Old Testament - name used by Western Christians for the Hebrew scriptures to distinguish them from the Greek scriptures, which they call the \\"New Testament\\". In the New Testament the Hebrew scriptures are simply denoted \\"the scriptures\\" or \\"the holy scriptures\\" (Matt. 21:42, John 5:39, 2 Tim. 3:15-16). Some Western Christians suggest a more neutral term, such as Hebrew Bible. P *Papal supremacy *Papal infallibility - *Paraclete *Parousia - advent or appearance of the Messiah and the Messianic Age. *The Passion *Passover (Christian holiday) *Paul the Apostle *Pauline privilege *Pentarchy *Pentateuch - the first five books of the Bible, i.e. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, traditionally attributed to Moses, hence also the Mosaic Law. See also Samaritan Pentateuch. *Pentecost *Peshitta - the standard version of the Bible for churches in Syriac Christianity. *Petrine privilege *Pharisees - The Pharisees were at various times a political party, a social movement, and a school of thought in the Holy Land during the time of Second Temple Judaism (536 BCE-70 CE). After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Pharisaic beliefs became the foundational, liturgical and ritualistic basis for Rabbinic Judaism. *Predestination - in theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by God, usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual soul. *Premillennialism - the belief that Jesus will physically return to the earth before the Millennium, a literal thousand-year golden age of peace. *Primacy of Simon Peter *Propitiation - is the act of appeasing or making well-disposed a deity, thus incurring divine favor or avoiding divine retribution. *Proselyte - an anglicization of the Koine Greek term προσήλυτος (proselytos), as used in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) for \\"stranger\\", i.e. a \\"newcomer to Israel\\"; a \\"sojourner in the land\\",; ; and in the Greek New TestamentStrong's G4339 for a first century convert to Judaism, generally from Ancient Greek religion. It is a translation of the Biblical Hebrew phrase גר תושב (ger toshav).Strong's H1616 Q *Quartodecimanism - part of the Easter controversy. R *Rabbinic *Rapture - the belief that either before, or simultaneously with, the Second Coming of Jesus Christ to earth, believers who have died will be raised and believers who are still alive and remain shall be caught up together with them (the resurrected dead believers) in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. *Red-Letter Christian *Redemption *Reformed *Remez/Allegory - (from Greek αλλος, allos, \\"other\\", and αγορευειν, agoreuein, \\"to speak in public\\") is a figurative mode of representation conveying a meaning other than the literal. Generally treated as a figure of rhetoric, but an allegory does not have to be expressed in language: it may be addressed to the eye, and is often found in realistic painting, sculpture or some other form of mimetic, or representative art. In allegorical representations, relationships between elements of a text or composition are understood to stand for different relationships between elements not found in the text or composition; meaning is thus constituted through the difference between the superficial (or literal) meaning of the text or composition, and a \\"deeper\\" meaning. In Jewish thought this method is best known through the works of Philo. The extreme form of remez, sod, understands the Tanakh as an allegory for a mystical understanding of the universe and as a means for mystical communion with God; this approach is best known through Kabbalistic texts such as the Zohar. Traditionally, only Jews who have mastered the midrashic method and the corpus of halakha are encouraged to pursue this form of interpretation. In Christianity this method was first promoted by Saint Paul. *Resurrection *Righteousness S *Sabbath in Christianity *Sabbath in seventh-day churches - Sabbath is generally a weekly religious day of rest as ordained by the Ten Commandments. Originally denoting a rest day on the seventh day of the week, the term \\"Sabbath\\" has acquired the connotation of a time of communal worship and now has several meanings in Christian contexts. *Sacrament *Saint Peter *Salvation *Sanctification *Satan *Second Coming *Septuagint *Sermon on the Mount *Sermon on the Plain *Seven Laws of Noah - according to Judaism, these are the laws applicable to non-Jews, some see a connection to the Apostolic Decree of the Council of Jerusalem. *Shekhinah *Shema Yisrael - in Jesus refers to the Shema as the first commandment (in importance.)Catholic Encyclopedia: Chronology of the Life of Jesus Christ: \\"At an early age He must have learned the so called Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4), and the Hallel, or Psalms 113-118 (Hebrew)\\" *Sin **Original sin **Eternal sin *Son of God *Son of man *Son of perdition *Sons of God *Spirit of God *Star of Bethlehem *Suffering Servant *Sunday school answer *Supersessionism T *Ten Commandments *Testament **Old Testament **New Testament *Tetragrammaton *Transfiguration *Transubstantiation *Trilemma *Trinity - used as a synonym for God, in order to call attention to the three distinct persons which share the single divine nature or essence. They are traditionally referred to as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, though some modern sects prefer more gender- neutral terms such as Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer. *Tzitzit - scholars think Jesus wore the tzitzit, see Christianity and fringed garments for details. V *Via Dolorosa *The Vine *Veronica *Vocation W *Walk with God *Western Schism *Whore of Babylon Y *Yahweh *Yeshua - spelled in Hebrew, a common name among Jews of the Second Temple Period, and known to be the name used for Jesus by Messianic Jews and Hebrew Christians.

It was built in 1855 by Judge John Bragg and is one of the most photographed buildings in the city as well as one of the more popular tourist attractions. The house has been attributed to John's brother, a local Alabama architect, Alexander J. Bragg.Gamble, Robert Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930, page 78. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. . History John Bragg was born near Warrenton, North Carolina. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1824, where he studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1830 and moved to Mobile in 1836, where he continued the practice of law. He was appointed judge to Alabama's 10th Judicial Circuit in 1842, later leaving that post after being elected to the 32nd United States Congress. He bought the property at 1906 Springhill Avenue on 10 May 1855 for the sum of $7500 and began construction of the house that continues to stand there today.Hammond, Ralph. Ante-Bellum Mansions of Alabama., page 172. New York: Architectural Book Publishers, 1951. The first floor hallway, looking toward the entrance doors. Two notable events in the history of the mansion occurred during the American Civil War. The first was the cutting of all of the live oak trees on the property to give the Confederate defenders of Mobile free range to shell any approaching Union troops. The second event was the removal of all of the furnishings from the mansion during the war to Bragg's plantation in Lowndes County. That plantation and all of the furnishings were subsequently burned when Wilson's Raiders went through that area, the irony being that Mobile itself never became a battleground as had been anticipated. John Bragg died in Mobile on 10 August 1878 and was interred in Magnolia Cemetery. The house remained in the Bragg family until 1880 when it was bought by William H. Pratt. John's brother, Confederate General Braxton Bragg, is often credited with owning the property after John Bragg's death, but this is not the case. He was a frequent guest at the house during John Bragg's lifetime and he did live on the property for a short time after the Civil War, while supervising the construction of jetties at the mouth of Mobile Bay, however. The property passed through the Upham, Davis, and Wingate families before it was purchased by A.S. Mitchell in 1924. Description The house is two-stories and built on a T-shaped plan. The architecture is in the Greek Revival style with tall, spindly columns that are derivative of the Doric order around a three-sided veranda. The bracketed cornice indicates some Italianate influence, a fusion of stylistic elements that some have dubbed a \\"bracketed Greek Revival\\". It contains fourteen rooms, with seven of those being bedrooms. The ground floor features ceilings.

The skirmish was fought between Union forces under Major William H. Forbes and Confederate forces under Colonel John S. Mosby near Aldie in Loudoun County, Virginia as part of Mosby's Operations in Northern Virginia. After successfully raiding the Union garrison at Point of Rocks, Maryland, Mosby's Rangers routed Forbes's command, which had been sent into Loudoun County to engage and capture the Rangers. The fight resulted in a Confederate victory. Background On July 2, Col. John S. Mosby was informed of Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early's plans to invade Maryland by the latter's quartermaster, Hugh Swartz, who was then traveling through Fauquier County. In order to aid Early's raid, Mosby planned a raid into Maryland of his own to cut telegraph wires between Washington, D.C., and Harpers Ferry. Accordingly, he ordered a rendezvous of the Rangers the following morning at Rectortown to which 250 Rangers responded. The Rangers spent the day in the saddle making it to Purcellville by days end where they made camp for the night. The next morning, July 4, the Rangers traveled the rest of the distance to the Potomac River, arriving across from Berlin (present day Brunswick) around 11 a.m., whereupon scouts were dispatched along the river to find possible targets of attack. When they returned, Mosby was informed of a small Union force at Point of Rocks, Maryland. Mosby determined this would be the Rangers target and they set out east down the Potomac to that village.Wert, p. 170. That same day, 100 troopers of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry and 50 from the 13th New York Cavalry under Maj. William H. Forbes were dispatched from Falls Church into Loudoun County by Col. Charles Russell Lowell to hunt down Mosby and his Rangers. The force traveled west down the Little River Turnpike (present day U.S. Route 50) to Lenah and then headed north up the Carolina Road toward Leesburg, stopping at Ball's Mill on the Goose Creek for the night. The following day, the Federals traveled to Aldie and then to Leesburg before returning to Ball's Mill.Saffer, pp. 40-41. =The 2nd Calico Raid= Upon arriving across the river from Point of Rocks, the Rangers found the village held by two companies of Federal infantry and two companies of cavalry in the form of the Loudoun Rangers, totaling 350 Federals in all. One of the companies of infantry inhabited Patton's Island in the middle of the Potomac, while the second occupied a small fort on high ground C&O; Canal. The Loudoun Rangers were encamped in the village.Goodheart. Mosby immediately set to work clearing Patton's Island in preparation for crossing the river. He deployed Ranger Sam Chapman with his lone howitzer on the bluff above the river bank and ordered a detachment of sharpshooters under Lt. Albert Wrenn to wade into the river and attack the Federal position on the island. The Federal infantry exchanged fire with the Rangers for several minutes before giving way to the combined rifle and artillery fire and fled to the Maryland shore, tearing up the small bridge over the canal as they crossed it. The Rangers then dashed across the river to the Maryland shore where they began exchanging fire with the Federals across the canal. Many of the Rangers immediately set about repairing the bridge using planking from an old building. As soon as it was complete the Rangers ran across, led by Henry Hatcher who ran into the Union camp under heavy fire and captured its flag. Once across the canal the Rangers quickly drove the Federals from the town.Wert, pp. 171-173. With the Union garrison dispatched, the Rangers set about burning canal boats and cutting the telegraph wires that ran beside the river from Washington to its garrison at Harpers Ferry. Besides Point of Rocks strategic value, it was also the refuge of many prominent Loudoun Unionists and their property, including the Loudoun Rangers' commander, Samuel C. Means. Thus after effecting the disruption of travel and communication along the Potomac the Rangers set about pilfering the stores and warehouses of the town, some of which contained property of Loudoun unionists. Because of the numerous pieces of fine clothing the Rangers returned with, the raid became known as the \\"Calico Raid\\". After completing the raid the Rangers retired back to Virginia and camped along the road to Leesburg. The following morning, Mosby dispatched about 100 Rangers to escort the three wagons full of plunder back to Fauquier. He also dispatched Rangers Fount Bettie and Harry Heaton to report to Early, who was camped near Antietam Creek, with the message that Mosby's command would coordinate with his. Mosby then led his Rangers back to Point of Rocks to continue his raid into Maryland. The actions of the Rangers, however had not gone unnoticed in Washington and after learning of the raid, Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck dispatched the 8th Illinois Cavalry from Washington to Point of Rocks.Leepsom, pp. 86-87. When the Rangers arrived at the banks of the Potomac they found the 8th Illinois holding the village. A 90-minute firefight across the river ensued, in which the 8th Illinois claimed to kill one and wound two rangers while suffering no casualties themselves (Mosby made no record of any casualties), before Mosby broke off the attack and headed south towards Leesburg. The 8th Illinois were soon dispatched from Point of Rocks to Monocacy Junction, where Union Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace was assembling a rag-tag force to oppose Early's drive on Washington, and along with the Loudoun Rangers, would fight in the Battle of Frederick and the Battle of Monocacy. The battle As Mosby approached Leesburg, his scouts reported to him the presence of the Federals under Forbes in the town. In response, Mosby led the Rangers into camp west of Leesburg on Catoctin Mountain where the Rangers spent the night. The Federals departed from Leesburg the next morning, July 6, and headed south by Oatlands Mill and on to Aldie. At around 6 p.m. the Federals arrived at the intersection with the Little River Turnpike and stopped to rest for an hour or so at the Skinner farm near Mount Zion Church. Meanwhile, Mosby entered Leesburg shortly after the Federals left and learned of their withdrawal. He led the Rangers out of town towards Ball's Mill on the Carolina Road, believing that the Federals had returned on the same route they had arrived on. At Ball's Mill Mosby was informed by local citizens of his mistake, whereupon he devised a plan to head southeasterly towards Gum Springs (present day Arcola) and intercept the Federals as they traveled east on the Little River Turnpike.Saffer, pp. 42-43 Upon arriving at Gum Springs, Mosby deployed his scouts who located the Federal force a half mile away on the western slope of a small ridge that lay between the two forces. Mosby deployed his howitzer on the crest of the ridge and formed his command on the Turnpike in columns of four led by Lt. Harry Hatcher with dozen skirmishers in advance. The skirmishers encountered Forbes' pickets just as the Federals were preparing to leave. Alerted by his pickets, Forbes quickly assembled his men into two lines in a field south of the pike and prepared to charges the oncoming Rangers. The shots of the skirmishers also alerted Ranger Sam Chapman manning the howitzer who let out a shot, which though not well aimed, caused disruption in the Federal line. Seeing that he could no longer order a charge, Forbes attempted to redeploy his lines to meet a charge. The disruption gave the Rangers time to dismantle a rail fence that stood between them and the Federals. Upon its removal the Rangers charged, delivering a deadly volley at the reforming Federal lines and startling the Federals' horses, sending their ranks into disarray.Wert, p. 174. The Federals broke southwest past the Skinner house and Mount Zion Church. For his part, Forbes attempted to rally his men, getting them to reform a line in the woods southwest of the pike. In the woods the two forces collided in fierce close range fighting. The Federals drew their sabers but found them ineffective against the Rangers pistol fire. In the close quarter fighting, Forbes encountered Mosby and attempted to stab him with his saber. Ranger Thomas Richards jumped in front of the blade, taking it in the shoulder and saving his commander. Mosby emptied his pistol, shooting out Forbes' horse from under him throwing him to the ground. Forbes quickly surrendered and the Federal resistance finally gave way. The Federals broke pell-mell into retreat with the Rangers in pursuit for several miles.Wert, p. 175. Aftermath The hour- long fight proved to be one of the Rangers' most complete victories. They inflicted severe casualties, killing 13,http://goldenanchorsharon.blogspot.com/2014/05/gone-but-not-forgotten- remembering.html including Captain Goodwin Stone, wounding 37, taking 57 prisoners, including Forbes, and capturing every horse not injured or killed in the fight, totaling 71% of the Federal force in all. The Rangers suffered 1 killed and 6 wounded. In addition, the telegraph wires that were cut at Point of Rocks during the Calico Raid would hinder the Federal pursuit of Early following the Battle of Fort Stevens.

The band's music falls into a number of different categories including ambient, goth, noise, chill out, dark, krautrock and experimental. Failure Of The Grand Design A mere 18 months after inception, Failure Of The Grand Design was the band's first full album release in October 2007 on the famed art-rock indie label Burning Shed. Described as \\"the best and most intense album released in 2007\\" by music website Cool Noise (where it was also named as \\"album of the year\\"); progressive site DPRP concluded that the band had \\"a unique sound devoid, for the most part, of any similarity to other bands\\" in its favourable review. Famed graphic artist Carl Glover joined the band's creative cabal for the release of Failure Of The Grand Design, using Lisa Vincent's photographs and the band's concepts to create the simple, yet truly iconic, sleeve. This creative pairing has continued since with Carl inputting his vast experience, expertise and library to help further the cause of The Resonance Association. We Still Have The Stars We Still Have The Stars, on the band's own mrs.vee recordings label, was released in November 2008 as a free download and collectible heavyweight vinyl. The promotional campaign for We Still Have The Stars saw tracks on the cover CDs of Terrorizer (None More Evil) and Classic Rock Presents Prog (The Moment Has Passed), as well as features in local press and a number of smaller music websites. Terrorizer praised the album's \\"genre hopping exploration of sounds\\" and Classic Rock described it as \\"a challenging and enjoyable listen\\". Heathen Harvest, who had already given the band's debut a glowing review, re- introduced the band to its readers as \\"England’s wonderful new sensation\\", whilst DPRP in giving the album 9/10 concluded that \\"the duo carves a sound all their own\\". Clarity In Darkness Recording for the third album Clarity In Darkness began in the spring of 2009, with the first clips appearing on the new website. The first track \\"Dangerous Fantasist\\" then appeared as the b-side to the last single from the We Still Have The Stars album, \\"The Moment Has Passed\\" in June 2009. The album saw a January 2010 release, and again garnered many favourable reviews; in print Terrorizer hailed that \\"fans of the Drone Zone will dig this ... a release that takes time to catch, but when it does it's impressive\\" and Rock-a-Rolla magazine described the album as \\"classic prog meets ambient meets drone meets industrial ... [Clarity In Darkness] definitely has its moments, strangely stuck in some parallel dimension between the 80s and the avant world of today\\"; whilst in the online world once again DPRP were enthusiastic, this time with a 10/10 review stating \\"I can think of no room for improvement from this awesome band\\", and The Music Fix commented \\"it does shredding, it does doom, it does prog and it does all of them spectacularly well. It's an album born of tremendous creativity that makes a distinct emotional connection throughout - even if sometimes those emotions may make you want to hide under a large cushion\\". Heliopause In June 2010, the EP Helipause Prelude was released on the mrs.vee recordings label as a precursor to the forthcoming album Heliopause; on the back of this release the band appeared in the September issue of Classic Rock Presents Prog in the \\"On The Threshold...\\" feature, and the EP received a very positive review in the same issue \\"...if the aggressive, doom-laden title track is the biggest indicator of where The Resonance Association are heading with Heliopause, then rest assured there is little chance of an anti-climax.\\" The release was also backed up with the band's most notable live performances to date.

A hail spike or three body scatter spike (TBSS) is an artifact on a weather radar display indicative of large hail. They are identified by a spike of weak reflectivity echoes that extend out from a thunderstorm, and away from the radar site.  Cause  The multiple reflections of the radar beam causing the hail spike Generally known as hail spikes, these are the result of energy from the radar hitting hail, or very heavy rain, and being reflected to the ground, where they reflect back to the hail and then to the radar as in the image on the left. This results in the radar picking up the energy from the multiple path at a later time than the energy that came back directly from the hail to the radar. Both are however on the same radial angle from the radar as the antenna did not have the time to turn significantly. The multipath echoes are then analyzed on the radar display as echoes extending in a radial direction behind the actual location of the hail/heavy rain core. The loss of energy by due to multiple reflections means weaker return echoes. The hail spike region has thus comparatively quite weaker echoes than the echoes directly from the hail or heavy rain core. Since hail cores are most intense at higher elevations, hail spikes usually appear at the levels aloft that accompany the most intense hail. Because of this, hail spikes are usually not seen at lower elevations. Another restriction to detection is that the signal of the radar beam has to do multiple reflections, each time weakening it, and are therefore usually noticeable only in extremely large hailstone cases.  Multiple TBSS Signatures  3-D image showing three separate TBSS signatures in one volume scan In rare cases more than one hail spike has been documented with a single storm in one volume scan. This indicates that more than one hail core exists in the same storm and far enough apart that each core can be sampled by the radar individually.  Use in forecasting  A cross-Section of a Three body spike from an Anti-Cyclonic Thunderstorm. The spike is the boxed areas to the left. Because of their observed accuracy in indicating large hail aloft, TBSS's are used operationally by the National Weather Service to identify thunderstorms that could likely produce large, severe hail. This would warrant the issuance of a severe thunderstorm warning or mention of large hail in a tornado warning.

Guidebook of the Western United States: Part C - The Santa Fe Route, With a Side Trip to Grand Canyon of the Colorado. U.S. Geological Survey. Bulletin 613, 194 pp. (See Plate 3-A) The Geology of Kansas encompasses the geologic history of the US state of Kansas and the present-day rock and soil that is exposed there. Rock that crops out in Kansas was formed during the Phanerozoic eon, which consists of three geologic eras: the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Paleozoic rocks at the surface in Kansas are primarily from the Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and Permian periods. Paleozoic Era The oldest rocks at the surface in Kansas are Mississippian rocks that consist of limestones, shale, dolomite, chert, sandstones and siltstones. The Mississippian consisted of an environment similar to what we see today. Fast moving streams and rivers cutting into the limestone bedrock and in places creating caverns and sinkholes.Buchanan, R., Kansas Geology: An Introduction to Landscapes, Rock, Minerals, and Fossils, University Press of Kansas, 1984, Ch 1, p. 10 ff Pennsylvanian rocks consist predominantly of alternating marine and non-marine shales and limestones with some sandstone, coal, chert and conglomerate. The Pennsylvanian was a time that the region that is now eastern Kansas stayed nearly at sea level. Between the transgression and regression of the seas, swamps and bogs formed, depositing dead vegetation and later, after burial under younger sediments, this dead vegetation formed into coal. Permian rocks predominantly consist of limestones, shales and evaporites. The Permian in Kansas began as an environment consisting of warm, shallow seas. As the Permian progressed, the climate became very dry and the seas began to subside, creating bodies of water shut off from the open seas, in turn creating areas for the generation of dark shales and evaporite minerals such as halite and gypsum as the waters evaporated. The end of the Permian marks the largest extinction period in Earth's history; over 90% of all life disappeared. Mesozoic Era Mesozoic rocks at the surface in Kansas consist predominantly of rocks from the Cretaceous. A relatively small outcrop of Jurassic sediments are exposed in the southwest corner of the state. Cretaceous age rocks consist of limestone, chalk, shale and sandstone. The Cretaceous in Kansas was an open ocean or sea environment dominated by microscopic marine plants and animals that floated or swam near the surface of this ancient water body. As these microscopic creatures died they sank to the bottom, formed a soft, limy ooze and would preserve any larger creatures that would die and sink into it. Cenozoic Era Cenozoic rocks at the surface were formed during the Paleogene, Neogene and Quaternary periods. Paleogene to Neogene rocks in Kansas consist of river silt, sand, freshwater limestones and some volcanic ash derived from eruptions in the western United States. Near the beginning of the Paleogene, the Rocky Mountains were born, as were the streams and rivers heading eastward out from the mountains into Kansas. Over 60 million years of erosion, the Rocky Mountains created a wedge of material extending to the Flint Hills of eastern Kansas. Quaternary rocks in Kansas consist of glacial drift; river silt, sand and gravel; dune sand and wind blown silt. The Quaternary Period in western Kansas was very similar to the Neogene, continual erosion of the Rocky Mountains deposited additional sediments. Physiographic regions Map showing physiographic regions of Kansas Adams, George Irving. 1903. The physiographic divisions of Kansas. Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science 18:109-123. Kansas has been divided into eleven different physiographic regions. =Ozark plateau= Mississippian limestones and cherts of the Ozark Plateau are exposed in extreme southeastern Kansas in Cherokee County.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/ozark/ozark.html Ozark Plateau, KGS This area was part of the Tri-state district of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Galena was a center of lead and zinc mining in the area.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/ozark/mining.html Lead and Zinc Mining, KGS =Cherokee lowlands= The Cherokee lowlands is a region of southeast Kansas immediately north and west of the Ozark plateau in Cherokee, Labette, Crawford and Bourbon Counties. The lowlands are developed on areas of gently rolling hils developed on the shale and sandstone of the Cherokee Group of Pennsylvanian age. The Cherokee Group is noted for rich deposits of coal in Kansas and across the midwestern United States.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/cherokee/cherokee.html Cherokee Lowlands KGS =Osage Cuestas= The Osage cuesta region underlies twenty counties in southeastern Kansas. The cuestas are a region of east to southeast facing escarpments (50 to 200 feet high) formed on resistant limestone units which dip gently to the west and northwest. Areas between escarpments are underlain by shales. The cuesta region contains coal, black shale and some oil shales. Lamproite sills occur within the cuesta units of Woodson and Wilson counties. These unusual igneous rocks were intruded in the Cretaceous Period.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/cuestas/cuestas.html Osage Cuestas—Introduction, KGShttp://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/cuestas/rocks.html Osage Cuestas—Rocks and Minerals, KGS =Chautauqua Hills= The Chautauqua Hills represent a narrow region in southeast Kansas of sandstone capped ridges and rolling hills. The Pennsylvanian age sandstones were deposited in a large river valley. The sandstones are the Tonganoxie Sandstone Member of the Stranger Formation and Ireland Sandstone Member of the Lawrence Formation. The hills occur in the western portions of Montgomery, Wilson and Woodson counties and the eastern edges of Chautauqua, Elk and Greenwood counties. The sandstones continue into northern Oklahoma.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/chautauqua/rocks.html Chautauqua Hills—Rocks and Minerals KGS =Flint Hills= The Flint Hills developed on the north-south exposure of Permian cherty limestones. The region extends from Marshall County in the north, to Cowley County and on into northern Oklahoma where they are known as the Osage Hills. The Permian limestones contain abundant weathering resistant chert (or flint) and the residuum and soils of the hilltops and the streambeds of the region contain abundant cherty gravels. Surface exposures of the rare igneous kimberlites occur in Riley and Marshall counties. The kimberlite diatremes are of Cretaceous age. No diamonds have been found in the Kansas kimberlite occurrences. Garnet crystals from the kimberlites have been reported in local stream gravels.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/flinthills/flinthills.html Flint Hills KGShttp://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/flinthills/rocks.html Flint Hills—Rocks and Minerals KGShttp://www.kgs.ku.edu/General/News/99_releases/kimberlites.html Rex Buchanan, Survey Discovers Three New Volcanic Features in Northeast Kansas, Kansas Geological Survey, Oct. 29, 1999 =Red Hills= The Red Hills cover a section of southern Kansas in Clark, Comanche, and Barber counties along the Oklahoma border. The Red Hills are named for their color derived from the Permian red beds which outcrop and underlie the region. The red color is produced by abundant iron oxides in the weathering sediments. The region is underlain by red shales, siltstones, and sandstones along with interbedded dolomites and gypsum evaporite layers. Massive gypsum deposits are mined near Sun City in northwestern Barber County. The Gyp Hills near Medicine Lodge were named for the gypsum of the Blaine Formation. The soluble gypsum, anhydrite and dolomite produce many caves in the area.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/redhills/redhills.html Red Hills KGShttp://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/redhills/rocks.html Red Hills—Rocks and Minerals KGS The Big Basin of Clark County is a 2 km diameter, 35 m deep, dissolution collapse feature that formed by the dissolution of salt beds in the subsurface. =Smoky Hills= The Smoky Hills constitute a large area of north central Kansas. The area is underlain by Cretaceous sediments. Rocks outcropping in the area include the sandstones of the Dakota Formation, the Greenhorn Limestone, and the thick Niobrara Chalk. Stratigraphically the Dakota is overlain by the Greenhorn and that by the Niobrara. The Dakota outcrops in the eastern portion of the region as gently westward dipping resistant ridges. Although the sandstones are the most resistant and therefore most prominent the Dakota includes shales and clays. The formation contains abundant brown iron oxides and many concretions are found in the area. In the western portions of the area the bedrock is fossiliferous chalk of the Niobrara Formation which includes the Smoky Hill Chalk member noted for abundant fish and marine reptile fossils.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/smoky/smoky.html Smoky Hills KGShttp://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/smoky/rocks.html Smoky Hills—Rocks and Minerals KGS =High Plains= The western third of Kansas is in the High Plains area. The highest point in Kansas, Mount Sunflower (), is located in the High Plains physiographic region. The uplift of the Rocky Mountains during the Cenozoic resulted in erosion and deposition of vast quantities of non- marine sediments eastward across the High Plains. The Ogallala Formation consists of a large wedge of unconsolidated sands and silts that is a significant aquifer under the plains. The Ogallala contains a sandstone layer cemented with opal. In the southwest corner of the state in Morton County rocks of Jurassic age outcrop along the Cimarron River. Loess deposits cover much of the High Plains in north and northwest Kansas.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/highplains/highplains.html High Plains KGShttp://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/highplains/rocks.html High Plains—Rocks and Minerals =Glaciated Region= The northeast corner of the state, north of the Kansas River and east of the Big Blue River, is covered by glacial debris deposited during the Pre-Illinoian glaciations which occurred 600,000 years ago in the Pleistocene. The Pennsylvanian and Permian bedrock is buried under thick deposits of glacial debris, largely loess. A variety of glacial erratics were left by the melting glaciers. Many of these are of Sioux Quartzite carried south from the Sioux Falls, South Dakota area.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/glacier/glacier.html Glaciated Region KGS =Wellington-McPherson Lowlands= The Wellington-McPherson Lowlands of south central Kansas in Sumner, Sedgwick, Harvey and McPherson counties is underlain by fluvial sediments deposited in the ancestral Arkansas River valley during the Pleistocene Epoch one to two million years ago. The sediments consist largely of sands, silts and gravels. These include the \\"Equus beds\\" aquifer sediments, named for Pleistocene fossils it contains. Also under this area is the Permian Hutchinson salt bed which reaches a thickness of 400 feet. The area also contains inactive sand dunes.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/lowlands/lowlands.html Arkansas River Lowlands and Wellington-McPherson Lowlands =Arkansas River Lowlands= The Arkansas River Lowlands follows the course of the Arkansas River through southwest and south-central Kansas. The broad floodplain contains large quantities of sand and silt carried from the Rocky Mountains by the river. A significant area of sand dunes occur on the south side of the plain formed by the prevailing winds from the glaciers to the north during the Pleistocene. Subsurface geology Subsurface structures of Kansas The subsurface geology of Kansas consists of several sequences of sedimentary strata deposited on the Pre-Cambrian basement of the North American Craton. Several regional subsurface structures including five sedimentary basins exist under Kansas. These structures are important in controlling the vast deposits of petroleum and natural gas in the state. The Central Kansas Uplift is a broad arch in the rocks of west central Kansas. The rock units within this arch have been major oil producers. The Anadarko Basin of southwest Kansas contains significant natural gas. The Sedgwick Basin, the Cherokee Basin and the Forest City Basin of south and east Kansas also produce petroleum and natural gas.http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Oil/primer09.html Petroleum geology of Kansas KGS =Proterozoic basement= Humboldt Fault (red) and Midcontinent Rift (green) in Kansas and Nebraska The Nemaha uplift is a deep fault zone which runs diagonally across east Kansas and extends from just south of Omaha, Nebraska to Oklahoma City. This fault zone directly overlies a granite \\"high\\" in the Precambrian basement and is structurally active as the Humboldt Fault. Some fifty miles to the west the southernmost extension of the Proterozoic Midcontinent Rift System extends into northeastern Kansas. Earthquakes in Kansas KGS The northern two-thirds of Kansas is underlain by a Proterozoic sequence known as the Central Plains Orogen. The igneous and metamorphic rocks of this orogenic zone are considered to be an extension of the 1.7 Ga fold belt exposed in Colorado and Wyoming.P. K. Sims and Z. E.

Its population was 4,292 as of the 2010 census, and as of 2018 the estimated population was 5,014. History A Masonic lodge named Archer No. 157 was established by the Grand Lodge of Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons of North Carolina on December 6, 1854, at what was then known as Creachville. In 1865, the lodge building was razed and the charter destroyed by Gen. William T. Sherman's Union Army on their way to Raleigh. The lodge received a new charter after the war, but a clerical error resulted in a misnumeration, and it was designated Archer Lodge No. 165. The community has had several post offices over the years. The first was called \\"Creachville\\", which existed from 1851 to 1866. This was followed by Archer Lodge (1877–1896). It was known as \\"Archer\\" from 1896 to 1912, when it closed. After 1912, the area was covered by either the Clayton or Wendell post offices.Notification Service  Post Offices The people of Archer Lodge voted on November 3, 2009, to incorporate Archer Lodge as a town. The vote was certified one week later. Geography Archer Lodge is in northern Johnston County, centered on the intersection of Buffalo Road and Covered Bridge Road, about south of Wendell and the same distance northeast of Clayton. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.29%, are water. The town is within the Neuse River watershed. DemographicsGrowth The Archer Lodge community is one of the fastest growing areas of Johnston County. A new middle school, Archer Lodge Middle School, opened in 2007, and the new high school, Corinth Holders High School, opened its doors in 2010 northeast of the town limits. Incorporation In early 2007, the process of incorporating the community of Archer Lodge was started. Three public meetings were held, and a petition was circulated. In August 2009, a bill to create the Town of Archer Lodge passed both the NC House and Senate. On November 3, 2009, a referendum vote was held. The referendum passed by a vote of 429 for and 318 against. Landmarks White Oak Baptist Church The most significant landmark in the community is C.E. Barnes Store, which has been in operation for over 75 years. The old Masonic Lodge used to be located right next door. The building that used to be the boarding house for the teachers at Archer Lodge School still stands next to the ball park and is being used as a private residence. White Oak Baptist Church stands at the heart of the community. The church used to be known as the Archer Lodge Missionary Baptist Church, but changed its name when it moved to its current location under a stand of white oak trees.

Overview of erosion models The two primary types of erosion models are process-based models and empirically based models. Process-based (physically based) models mathematically describe the erosion processes of detachment, transport, and deposition and through the solutions of the equations describing those processes provide estimates of soil loss and sediment yields from specified land surface areas. Erosion science is not sufficiently advanced for there to exist completely process-based models which do not include empirical aspects. The primary indicator, perhaps, for differentiating process-based from other types of erosion models is the use of the sediment continuity equation discussed below. Empirical models relate management and environmental factors directly to soil loss and/or sedimentary yields through statistical relationships. Lane et al.Lane, L.J., E.D. Shirley, and V.P. Singh. 1988. \\"Modeling erosion on hillslopes.\\" p.287-308. In: M.G. Anderson (ed.) \\"Modeling Geomorphological Systems.\\" John Wiley, Publ., NY. provided a detailed discussion regarding the nature of process-based and empirical erosion models, as well as a discussion of what they termed conceptual models, which lie somewhere between the process-based and purely empirical models. Current research effort involving erosion modeling is weighted toward the development of process-based erosion models. On the other hand, the standard model for most erosion assessment and conservation planning is the empirically based USLE, and there continues to be active research and development of USLE- based erosion prediction technology. Description of USLE The USLE was developed from erosion plot and rainfall simulator experiments. The USLE is composed of six factors to predict the long-term average annual soil loss (A). The equation includes the rainfall erosivity factor (R), the soil erodibility factor (K), the topographic factors (L and S) and the cropping management factors (C and P). The equation takes the simple product form: :A = R K L S C P The USLE has another concept of experimental importance, the unit plot concept. The unit plot is defined as the standard plot condition to determine the soil's erodibility. These conditions are when the LS factor = 1 (slope = 9% and length = 22.1 m (72.6 ft) where the plot is fallow and tillage is up and down slope and no conservation practices are applied (CP=1). In this state: :K = A/R A simpler method to predict K was presented by Wischmeier et al.Wischmeier, W.H., C.B. Johnson, and B.V. Cross. 1971. \\"A soil erodibility nomograph for farmland and construction sites.\\" Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 26:189-193. which includes the particle size of the soil, organic matter content, soil structure and profile permeability. The soil erodibility factor K can be approximated from a nomograph if this information is known. The LS factors can easily be determined from a slope effect chart by knowing the length and gradient of the slope. The cropping management factor (C) and conservation practices factor (P) are more difficult to obtain and must be determined empirically from plot data. They are described in soil loss ratios (C or P with / C or P without).

The main source for her biography is the account of historian Ammianus Marcellinus. Her origins and other names are unknown. Marriage Constantius married her in Antioch in 361, after the death of his second wife, Eusebia in 360.Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, vol. 1 Ammianus simply reports that the marriage took place while Constantius was wintering in Antioch, taking a break from the ongoing Roman–Persian Wars. \\"At that same time Constantius took to wife Faustina, having long since lost Eusebia\\". She was pregnant when Constantius died on 3 November 361 and later gave birth to their posthumous daughter, Flavia Maxima Constantia, the only child of the emperor. Constantia later married Emperor Gratian.\\"Constantius, therefore, having reached Antiochia by forced marches, intending (as was his custom) eagerly to encounter civil disturbances at their outset, and having made all his preparations, was in immoderate haste to set out, although many opposed it, but only by murmurs; for no one dared openly to dissuade or to forbid him. When autumn was already waning he began his march, and on coming to a suburban estate called Hippocephalus, distant three miles [4.5 km] from the city, he saw in broad daylight on the right side of the road the corpse of a man with head torn off, lying stretched out towards the west. Terrified by the omen, although the fates were preparing his end, he kept on with the greater determination and arrived at Tarsus. After this followed the last mournful call to the deceased, and grief and wailing broke out; then those who held the first rank in the royal court considered what they should do, or what they ought to attempt. And after a few had been sounded secretly as to the choice of an emperor, at the suggestion of Eusebius (as was reported), whom the consciousness of his guilt pricked, since Julian's nearness made an attempt at revolution inadvisable, Theolaifus and Aligildus, at that time counts, were sent to him, to report the death of his kinsman, and beg him to lay aside all delay and come to take over the Orient, which was ready to obey him. However, rumour and an uncertain report had it that Constantius had made a last will, in which (as I have said) he wrote down Julian as his heir and gave commissions and legacies to those who were dear to him. Now he left his wife with child, and the posthumous daughter to whom she afterwards gave birth was called by his name, and when she grew up was united in marriage with Gratianus.\\" - Widow On 28 September 365 Faustina was present when Procopius received the insignia of the imperial rites in Constantinople. Faustina and her little daughter's presence suggested that Procopius was the rightful heir of the Constantinian dynasty which was still held in reverence.\\"For some divisions of cavalry and infantry which had been raised for the campaign in Thrace passed that way; they were received courteously and generously, and when they were all united in one body, there was already the appearance of an army. Eager for the riches that were promised, they swore allegiance to Procopius with dire penalties for disloyalty, promising to stand by him and protect him with their lives. There was found, besides, a very favourable means of winning them over, namely, that Procopius took in his arms the little daughter of Constantius, whose memory they honoured, and carried her about, claiming kinship with the former emperor. And he gained another timely advantage in that Faustina, the girl's mother, happened to be present when he had received some insignia forming a part of the imperial adornment.\\" - Ammianus considers that Procopius having Faustina and Constantia by his side increased the loyalty of the people to his cause: After the Battle of Thyatira and the fall of Procopius in 366, Faustina passes out of sight.

During the period from 1924-1929, Travel Air produced more aircraft than any other American manufacturer, including over 1,000 biplanes. While an exact number is almost impossible to ascertain due to the number of conversions and rebuilds, some estimates for Travel Air as a whole range from 1,200 to nearly 2,000 aircraft. Phillips, 1982, pp.?Bissionette, 1999, pp.?Wilkinson, 28 February 2014, pp.?Cooper, 2008, pp.? Design and development=Design and development= The Travel Air Model A was engineered chiefly by Lloyd Stearman, with input from Travel Air co-founders Walter Beech, Clyde Cessna, and Bill Snook and could trace its ancestry back to the Swallow New Swallow biplane. The Travel Air, however, replaced the New Swallow's wooden fuselage structure with a welded steel tube. An interim design, the Winstead Special, was developed by the Winstead brothers from a metal fuselage frame developed at Swallow by Stearman and Walter Beech, but subsequently rejected by Swallow president Jake Moellendick, a decision which triggered the departure of both Stearman and Beech, and the creation of Travel Air. Until the appearance of the all new 12/14/16 series, all subsequent Travel Air biplanes would be derived from the Model A. The Travel Air biplanes were conventional single-bay biplanes with staggered wings braced by N-struts. The fuselage was fabric-covered welded chromium-molybdenum alloy steel tubes, faired with wooden battens and they had two open cockpits in tandem, with the forward cockpit carrying two passengers side-by-side. In common with the Fokker D.VII that they resembled, the rudder and ailerons of the first Travel Air biplanes had an overhanging \\"horns\\" to counterbalance the aerodynamic loads on the controls, helping to reduce control forces and making for a more responsive aircraft. These were the distinctive Travel Air \\"elephant ear\\" ailerons which lead to the airplane's popular nicknames of Old Elephant Ears and Wichita Fokker. Some subsequent models were offered without the counterbalance, providing a cleaner, more conventional appearance with less drag. Pitch forces could be trimmed out with an inflight-adjustable horizontal stabilizer. Different, interchangeable wings were offered, including a shorter and thinner wing known as the \\"Speedwing\\" which improved speed. A considerable number of engines were installed, including nearly every mass produced engine in the range available at the time, and a number of more obscure prototype engines, as can be seen in the list of designation prefixes. Travel Air entered the specially-modified Model 4000-T in the Guggenheim Safe Aircraft Competition of 1930, but it was disqualified, as were all production aircraft entered during the qualification trials. The Travel Air biplanes were noted for their good flying qualities which may have helped Travel Air outsell all rivals by 1929. =Steam- powered= In 1933, George and William Besler replaced the usual gasoline powered piston engine in a Travel Air 2000 with an oil-fired, reversible V-twin compounding steam engine, which would become the first airplane to successfully fly using a steam engine.Fitzgerald, 1933, pp.9-11 Operational history In addition to a wide range of normal aircraft applications, the Travel Air biplanes saw extensive use in early motion pictures, where they often stood in for the increasingly scarce Fokker D.VII. Aside from surplus military aircraft such as the Curtiss JN-4 Jenny, during the late 1920s and very early 1930s, Travel Air biplanes were, along with their chief competitor, WACO, were the most widely used civilian biplanes in America. Travel Air biplanes were popular as executive transports, and many were purchased by wealthy-sportsmen adventurers who entered them in the competitions and air races that were frequently held during that era.ref name=wichita_4/> Like many aircraft of the period, they also operated as air taxis and provided air charter services, carrying passengers and light air cargo, and some would find their way north where they worked as bushplanes. As the supply of war-surplus aircraft declined and they became available on the used aircraft market, many were also used for barnstorming, which included exhibition and stunt flying, and selling rides. Commercial operators found the Travel Air biplanes to be versatile, owing to their useful payload, rugged construction and (for the times) speed and efficiency. Towards the end of their career elsewhere, from the late-1930s through the early 1960s, they were increasingly used for the harsh work of bush flying and cropdusting, and Travel Air biplanes were among the most commonly used cropdusters, perhaps second only to surplus Stearman Kaydet biplanes. Most remaining Travel Air biplanes have been restored, and are in museums, while a small number continue to be used for personal recreation or selling rides and flying at airshows.\\"What's New,\\" page, Travel Air Restorers Association website, retrieved January 28, 2017. A Travel Air normally based in the San Diego area is the oldest regularly flying aircraft tracked by FlightRadar24, an aviation tracking website. As the 2000/3000/4000 series was nearing the end of its development cycle, a pair of new designs, the Travel Air 12 and 14 were developed to replace it - the 12 as a slightly smaller two-seat trainer, and the larger 14 as a direct replacement, even to continuing some of the marketing names. Both would fly while Travel Air retained its identity, but would be incorporated into the Curtiss-Wright line with the same numbers. =Movie Industry= Travel Air biplanes were widely used in 1920s/1930s war movies, particularly to represent the airplanes they were patterned after: Germany's Fokker D-VII fighter, the top fighter of World War I. In the motion picture industry, they were known as \\"Wichita Fokkers.\\" In fact, Hollywood's demand for Travel Air biplanes was so intense that Travel Air's California salesman, Fred Hoyt, coaxed Travel Air co-founder and principal airplane designer, Lloyd Stearman, to come to Venice, California in 1926 to exploit the movie industry demand for his aircraft by starting the short-lived independent Stearman Aircraft Company (re-opened back in Wichita in 1927).Harris, 2017 Some of the many movies using Travel Air biplanes (2000 and 4000, in particular) included: * Wings (1927) won the first-ever Academy Award for Best Picture for its technical accuracy * Flying Fool (1929) early leading roles for William Boyd, later famous as \\"Hopalong Cassidy\\") * Hell's Angels (1930) extravagant war epic by Howard Hughes * The Dawn Patrol (1930) * Heartbreak (1931) * Ace Of Aces (1933) featured five Travel Air Model Bs, and numerous other aircraft. * Hell in the Heavens (1933) * Flying Devils (1933) * Murder in the Clouds (1934) Variants Date from AerofilesEckland, Aerofiles.com Curtiss OX-5-powered Travel Air 2000 at the Historic Aircraft Restoration Museum, Dauster Field, Creve Coeur, MissouriTravel Air 3000Travel Air 4000 at Fantasy of Flight.Travel Air E-4000 =Early Letter Designations= Initially Travel Air assigned letters to each type, with a suffix denoting the engine. :;Model A:1925 Prototype, with WW1 style straight axle.

Redesignated as 3000. :;Model BW:1926 Model B with a Wright J-4 9-cylinder radial engine. Redesignated CW-4000 =Numerical designation sequences= Variants were distinguished with prefixes and suffixes in a particular order, and denoting different fittings. The prefix S, preceding all other prefixes meant it was a Seaplane and was fitted with floats. Next it was wings. B was the Standard wing, not to be confused with the original basic elephant ear wing, and D indicated the aircraft was fitted with a Speedwing. The engine code followed this, and due to the long service period when considerable experimentation occurred, a wide variety of engines were installed in production airplane as follows: :*A - Axelson B engine 7-cylinder radial engine :*B - Wright J-5 Whirlwind 9-cylinder radial engine :*C - Curtiss Challenger 6-cylinder radial, or Curtiss C-6 inline engine :*D - Aeromarine B 6-cylinder inline engine :*E - Wright J-6-5 Whirlwind 5-cylinder radial engine :*J4 - Wright J-4 Whirlwind 9-cylinder radial engine :*K - Kinner K-5 5-cylinder radial engine :*W - Warner Scarab 7-cylinder radial engine :*L - Lycoming R-680 9-cylinder radial engine :*V - Velie ML-9 9-cylinder radial engine :*W - Warner Scarab S-50 radial 7-cylinder engine :*9 - Wright J-6-9 Whirlwind 9-cylinder radial engine Following the engine code in a very small number of cases, M, indicated that it was a single seater configured as a Mailplane, and then the model number. The same system was also used with the later numerical desigation sequence. The sole example of the mailplane seems to have been the BM-4000, a Wright J-5 powered mailplane, of which 7 were built. Not all possible variations were built. Suffixes were also added that were specific to modifications made and often referred to conversions or post-production versions. 1000 series Designations :;1000:Formerly Model A with Curtiss OX-5 water-cooled V-8 engine :;2000:Formerly Model B with Curtiss OX-5 engine :::C-2000 - Curtiss C-6 6-cylinder inline engine :::S-2000 - Curtiss OXX-6 water-cooled V-8 engine powered Seaplane :::SC-2000 - Curtiss C-6 powered Seaplane :::2000-T - Milwaukee Tank V470 or V502 air-cooled V-8 engine :;3000:Formerly Model BH with Hispano-Suiza 8A or Wright model E water-cooled V-8 engine :::D-3000 straight wing for competition 1928 :;4000: Wright J-5 radial engine :::4000-T - Wright J-6 Whirlwind radial engine, converted C-4000 for 1930 Safe Airplane competition, Curtiss-built wings :::4000-CAM - Fairchild-Caminez 447 X engine, also designated 8000 and later Curtiss-Wright CW-8 :::4000-SH - Ryan-Siemens Sh 14 radial engine, also designated 9000 and later Curtiss-Wright CW-9 :;8000:Also designated 4000-CAM, Fairchild-Caminez 447 X engine, became Curtiss-Wright CW-8 :;9000:Also designated 4000-SH, Ryan-Siemens Sh 14 engine, became later Curtiss-Wright CW-9 Late Numerical sequence :;4 :originally 4000 series :::4-B - Wright J-6 :::4-D - Wright J-5, E-4000. :::4-P/PT - ACE LA-1 (later became Jacobs LA-1) :::4-S - 4000 with experimental Powell engine :::4-U - Comet 7-D or 7RA 7-cylinder air-cooled radial :::W-4-B - Ted Wells Special Single seat competition aircraft modified from D-4000 :::Z-4-D - 4-D crop duster with Wright J-6 Whirlwind :;11 :Modified D-2000 with Wright J-6 Whirlwind 9-cylinder radial engine and a narrower fuselage for competition :::B-11D: Wright J-6 Whirlwind, modified 4-D for competition in the National Air Races =Curtiss-Wright designations= :;CW-8 :: Curtiss-Wright designation for Travel Air 8000 :;CW-9 :: Curtiss- Wright designation for Travel Air 9000 :;CW-11 :: Curtiss-Wright designation for Travel Air 11 Operators ; :Peruvian Air Force - operated at least one Travel Air E-4000 at the start of the Leticia Incident in 1932.

He was a popular author and radio commentator, best known for his vocal skepticism of the alleged Amityville Horror hauntings. Kaplan lived in Suffolk County, New York and worked for the New York City Board of Education. His overview of the Amityville Horror became the basis for the film Amityville 3-D that chronicles his attempt to prove the story was a hoax. Overview of the Amityville Horror dispute The picturesque home known as the Amityville Horror was made famous in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo Jr. shot and killed his parents and four younger siblings there. On November 21, 1975, DeFeo was sentenced to serve six sentences of 25 years to life. George and Kathy Lutz moved into the house on December 18, 1975. They remained in the house for one month before fleeing, citing hauntings, demons, and other unexplained disturbances. Jay Anson’s 1977 book The Amityville Horror chronicles the paranormal events leading up to their departure from the Lutzes' perspective. The book became a runaway bestseller, and was made into a popular 1979 movie starring James Brolin, Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger. The 1977 book was re- adapted and re-imagined in a 2005 film starring Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078767/?ref_=nv_sr_2https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384806/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Kaplan's The Amityville Horror Conspiracy counters Anson's work, and argues that Lutz deliberately defrauded the public. According to Kaplan, on February 16, 1976, shortly after the Lutzes abandoned the house, Kaplan received a phone call from George Lutz. At the time, Kaplan was the executive director of the Parapsychology Institute of America, based on Long Island and a frequent guest on the WBAB radio program Spectrum with Joel Martin\\". Lutz requested that Kaplan and his associates at the Parapsychology Institute investigate the home. As Kaplan recalled in his account of the incident, The Amityville Horror Conspiracy, this initial conversation immediately aroused his suspicions as to the validity of George Lutz’s claim that the house was haunted. Kaplan claims Lutz asked about a fee for the group's services and Kaplan told him that they did not charge for the investigation but that \\"if the story is a hoax...the public will know.\\" Shortly after, Lutz called and canceled the investigation. George and Kathleen Lutz claimed that Kaplan's credentials did not check out and that his claiming of himself as a vampirologist made them leery of any involvement with the case. Stephen Kaplan also claimed to hold a PhD that he did not actually have. This isn't the first time they were questioned, either. Ed and Lorraine Warren had defended themselves with this when questioned about the Amityville Horror Conspiracy. Much of the claims and debates between the Kaplans and the Lutz family can be viewed in a documentary titled Amityville: Horror or Hoax distributed by the History Channel. Both sides can be viewed and heard as stated by the actual people who were involved.

Judgment In the hearing of the Court of Appeal, Bernard Weatherill QC for Armitage submitted that the \\"irreducible core\\" duties of a trustee include the following. :(1) a duty to inquire into the extent and nature the property and the trusts (see Hallows v Lloyd (1888) 39 Ch D 686, 691; Nestlé v National Westminster Bank Plc [1993] 1 WLR 1260, 1265e, 1266h, 1275e-g and Wyman v Paterson [1900] AC 271); :(2) a duty to obey directions in the settlement unless the deviation is sanctioned by the court (see Harrison v Randall (1851) 9 Hare 397, 407 and Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan [1995] 2 AC 378, 390a-b); :(3) a duty to account for his stewardship of the assets under his control; :(4) a duty to carry on the business of the trust with the degree of prudence to be expected of a hypothetically reasonably prudent man of business (see Speight v Gaunt (1883) 9 App Cas 1, 19 and In re Whiteley, Whiteley v Learoyd (1886) 33 ChD 347, 355).

It is best known for the three-block section in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood which is home to some of the city's popular live-music venues including Cafe Negril, Blue Nile, Snug Harbor, the Spotted Cat, and the Maison in addition to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, record and book shops, and other local businesses. Frenchmen Street tiles Decatur, in Faubourg Marigny Location Frenchmen Street runs from the intersection with Esplanade Avenue just inland from the Mississippi, back to the Gentilly neighborhood.  History  The oldest and best-known section of Frenchmen Street is in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood, just downriver from the Vieux Carré or French Quarter. This area was once the plantation of Bernard de Marigny, a wealthy Creole and political leader of old New Orleans. He exemplified the Creoles of his day, with his joie de vivre -- a keen enjoyment of living. In 1806, he had his property subdivided and developed as a neighborhood. Many of the houses in this area are over 100 years old; some are much older. Frenchmen Street got its name from \\"six French men who were executed after leading an uprising after Louisiana was ceded to Spain.\\" The Frenchmen Street entertainment district began developing in the 1980s. As Bourbon Street became more tourist-focused, Frenchmen emerged as a spot for locals to enjoy live local music, as it was more geared toward authentic New Orleans musical and gastronomical tastes. Residing on some of the highest ground in the city, Frenchmen Street survived Katrina relatively unscathed. Following the catastrophe, the street was officially designated a city arts and entertainment district; its popularity increased when it was patronized by people who came to New Orleans to help rebuild, and by visitors who sought authentic local music. After the Saints' Super Bowl win in 2010, the street received national news media coverage for hosting one of the largest celebrations in the city's history. Frenchmen Street was also featured on the HBO series Tremé. Frenchmen Street entertainment district Ole Man River Band, Frenchmen Street Architecture Wandering down Frenchmen Street, a passerby will notice the New Orleans architecture that makes the city stand apart from other American metropolitan areas. Frenchmen Street is home to many Creole cottages—a New Orleans design stemming back to the period between 1790-1850. Creole cottages are single- story, set at ground level, have a steeply-pitched roof, symmetrical four- opening façade, and are set close to the front property line. The cottages are usually made of stucco or wood. In the “French Quarter Manual,” architect Benjamin H. Latrobe described the cottages: “These one-storied houses are very simple in their plan. The two front rooms open into the street with French glass doors. Those on one side are the dining & drawing rooms, the others, chambers. The front rooms, when inhabited by Americans, are the family rooms, & the back rooms the chambers.”Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Impressions Respecting New Orleans, Diary & Sketches, 1818-1820. Frenchmen Street also has a number of examples of another New Orleans-style home, the Creole townhouse. This style dates from 1788, following the Great New Orleans Fire. The Creole townhouse is a two- to four-story structure set at or near ground level, with a symmetrical arrangement of arched openings on the façade, set on the property line, an iron balcony at the second and sometimes third levels, and a steeply-pitched, side-gabled roof, often with multiple dormers. It usually has a stucco or brick exterior.

Tissue distribution and secretion  The PGLYRP1 gene is highly expressed in bone marrow, circulating Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMLs), and in the corneal epithelium. The PGLYRP1 protein is primarily found in the granules of PMLs.  Structure  As with most PGRPs, PGLYRP1 has one carboxy-terminal type 2 amidase domain (also known as a PGRP domain) and consists of three alpha helices, five beta strands and coils, and has three pairs of conserved cysteins which form three disulphide bonds. PGLYRP1 can form homodimers for its antimicrobial activity, and can complex with HSP70 for its cytotoxic activity.  Function  The PGLYRP1 protein plays an important role in the innate immune response. It is bactericidal against gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and L. monocytogenes and generally has proinflammatory effects, inducing TNF-a and IFN-g in many tissues. PGLYRP-1 is also known to form a cytotoxic complex with HSP-70, suggesting it may also have a role in anti-cancer defense. As a pathogen recognition protein with antimicrobial properties, PGLYRP-1 is suspected to play an important role in maintaining the gut microbial flora.  Mechanism of action  As an antimicrobial, the binding of PGLYRP1 to its target does not permeabilize the bacterial cell wall like defensins and other antimicrobial peptides. Instead, PGLYRP1 binding activates a bacterial stress response that causes the bacterium to shut down transcription and translation, and induces oxidative stress. As a cytotoxic agent, the PGLYRP1-HSP70 complex  Possible pathological role  In humans, single nuclear polymorphisms of the PGLYRP1 gene have been associated with the development of ulcerative colitis. In mice, the lack of PGLYRP1 is associated with increased susceptibility to infectious disease, but also decreased susceptibility to autoimmune disease. The lack of PGLYRP1 was found to have increased susceptibility to corneal infections, reduced corneal wound healing, and increased scarification of the cornea when infected by P. aeruginosa. But PGLYRP1-deficient mice also had decreased severity of atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis. and may play a role in the development of asthma.

It is an example of a nanomedicine. The agent represents a nanoparticle conjugate that consists of a drug delivery molecule, namely a cyclodextrin-based polymer (CDP) and an anti-cancer compound (camptothecin). It was developed by Mark E. Davis, professor of Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology, and associates at Insert Therapeutics, Inc., now Calando Pharmaceuticals, Inc., hence the original name \\"IT-101\\". Its novel delivery mode allows the agent, and thus the toxic anti-cancer component, to be preferentially accumulated in cancer tissue. In turn, toxic side effect are expected to be reduced. The technology was licensed by Calando and Caltech to Cerulean Pharma Inc., in June, 2009. Rationale Camptothecin (CPT), an alkaloid extract with poor water solubility from plants such as camptotheca acuminata, exhibits anti-cancer activity possibly due, at least in part, by the inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I resulting in cell death. In CRLX101, CPT is linked covalently through a glycine link to the linear copolymer CDP, which in turn consists of alternating subunits of beta- cyclodextrin and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The CRLX101 nanoparticle is water- soluble. After intravenous injection, active CPT is slowly released as the linkage is hydrolysed. The size of the nanoparticle (20-50 nm in diameter) facilitates its extravasation in the more leaky vessels of tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect and as a result, the anticancer drug is enhanced and retained in the tumor tissue. Clinical trials The Phase 1/2a clinical trial was conducted at the City of Hope National Medical Center, the Translational Genomics Research Institute and San Juan Oncology Associates. Alternate drug name CRLX101 was originally named \\"IT-101\\" and was changed to CRLX101 after licensing to Cerulean Pharma Inc. CRLX101 is the official name in clinical trials.

On this present day, Withymoor Village is a local housing estate that consists of approximately 2000 houses but Withymoor was not always a housing estate. In 1971 the site of Withymoor was an opencast colliery. The collieries were called the Plants Hollow and Gayfield Collieries which are now names of streets on the estate. Also while the collieries were on Withymoor there was also another business called William King's Brick Works which was a famous producer of yellow bricks from the local clay which was used in both Amblecote Church and Quarry Bank Church. Most of Withymoor Village was built by Bovis Homes. The first bit of the development was built by Page and Johnson until their takeover by Bovis Homes, who built the remainder of the village. Later Mc Lean Homes built Beechwood Park estate between 1987 and 1989 and then later Seven Dwellings View in the mid-1990s. There was also very little developments built by Cox Homes on Turners Lane around 1985 and Kendrick Homes on the entrance of Norbury Drive and on Gayfield Avenue around the mid-1980s. The village has approximately 2000 homes and is surrounded by a newer development, classed as Amblecote and has always historically been classed as Withymoor Village or Lakeside. In the late 1970s a primary school was built in the village and was named Withymoor Primary School. Around the same time, a doctors surgery and Spar (formerly Dillons and now is One Stop) shop and chemist opened. The local GP was called Dr Rigler, who was a well-known character. In 1985, a J Sainsbury's supermarket opened in the centre of the village along with a Sainsbury's Freezer Centre (later a Chinese takeaway called Jasmine House which is now located on the Caledonian estate) and a newsagent called Preedys which was later changed to a Choices Video Outlet in 2006. The Chinese takeaway and the Choices Video Outlet was later closed due to Sainsbury's expansion plans. In 2007, a new doctor's surgery was built in the centre of the village, opposite Sainsbury's in a better location for transport and parking, which had been a major issue at the old surgery location. The estate also includes a medium-sized lake (hence a newer adjoining estate is known as lakeside) that is supplied by a deep underground river. This ensures that no matter how severe a drought there is, or how much rainfall there is, the lake maintains the same level - within a few inches. The streets in Withymoor now include Thornton Drive, Ravensitch Walk, Plants Hollow, Gayfield Avenue and Warner Drive, somewhere previously named after local curiosities. Gayfield and Plants Hollow are both former coal mines, Ravensitch is named after Wright's Farm off Woods Lane which is nearby and other streets on site are named after English places such as Barsham Drive, Briston Close, Aldeford Drive, Sedgeford Close. Other streets were also named after trees such as Palm Croft, Conifer Close and Fir Croft. Now Withymoor Village is a modern, vibrant community.

It was built in what was then the eastern limits of the city of Madrid. Today, what little remains of its buildings and gardens forms the Retiro Park. History  Philip IV used to stay occasionally in some rooms annexed to the monastery of San Jerónimo el Real (close to the current location of the Prado Museum, which received the name of the Royal Quarters. The reason for these frequent visits could be that the so-called Planet King particularly enjoyed walking in the attached farm, property of the Count-Duke of Olivares, his royal favourite and minister. Olivares, with the intention of pleasing the monarch, planned in 1629 and started in 1630 the construction of a series of offices and pavilions as an extension of the Royal Quarters, which ended up forming the Buen Retiro Palace. The building of the palace was not something planned from the start, but occurred over a period of seven years (until 1640 during which further additions were built successively). Once finished, the palace consisted of more than 20 buildings and two large open squares used for court entertainments and various other acts. The palace complex was surrounded by a large expanse of gardens and ponds, giving it a playful character. The king only used to spend a few days per year, usually in the summer, in his second home, but a large campaign was still carried out to provide the palace with an artistic ornamental level that would match that of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, his main residence. The lack of antique paintings in the market led to the commission of a series of paintings from Rome and Naples, which required the management of ambassadors and others of Philip IV's workers. Several of these pictures remain in the Prado Museum; some highlights are the landscapes of Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin and Gaspard Dughet, Biblical and mythological scenes by Massimo Stanzione and several paintings of ancient Rome by Giovanni Lanfranco, among other artists. For the Salón de Reinos (royal reception room; until recently the Army Museum) a commemorative series of Spanish military triumphs was commissioned, including Diego Velázquez' famous painting The Surrender of Breda. Other paintings of the series are due to Francisco Zurbarán, Antonio de Pereda, Juan Bautista Maíno and Vicente Carducho. The palace remained a royal residence until the late 18th century. After the fire of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in December 1734, the Buen Retiro Palace became the main seat of the royal court until the construction of the new Royal Palace of Madrid, which was finished in 1764. Due to its hasty design and construction, the building of the palace was low-quality, including the materials used, and this was the cause of its end. During the Peninsular War, in 1808 French troops stationed in Madrid used the palace and its annexes as barracks. Powder kegs were stored in the gardens and a bunker was built for them, causing irreparable damage to the area. Furthermore, the buildings were seriously damaged, so much so that when Isabella II tried to begin its restoration, it was decided that nothing could be done but to demolish it almost completely. Today The main remaining trace of the Palace complex is the gardens of Retiro Park, although these have no resemblance to the original design of the gardens, and encompass only half the original extent. Two other buildings remain, much altered from their original exteriors, both now destined to become part of the Prado Museum complex: *The Salón de Reinos (originally the royal reception room), which for decades housed the Museo del Ejército (Army Museum) until it moved to the Alcázar de Toledo in 2010–12. *The Salón de Baile (originally the ballroom), now known as the Casón del Buen Retiro, once housing the 19th-century Prado collections, now hosts the Study Center of the Prado Museum. The ceiling of the main room is decorated by a magnificent fresco by the Italian artist Luca Giordano, painted around 1696–1697 for King Charles II of Spain and depicting The Apotheosis of the Spanish Monarchy.

Structure  This gene encodes a mitochondrial matrix protein that is the subunit of a barrel-shaped homo-oligomeric protein complex, the Lon protease. Lon protease is a member of ATP-dependent proteases (AAA+ proteases). Mature and catalytically viable human lon protease complex contains a hexameric ring while other formations of complexes have been observed such as the heptameric ring in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A single subunit of lon protease contains three domains, N-domain for protein substrate recognition, AAA + module for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and P-domain for protein proteolysis. A similar protease expressed in E.coli. regulates gene expression by targeting specific regulatory proteins for degradation. Lon protease binds a specific sequence in the light and heavy chain promoters of the mitochondrial genome which are involved in regulation of DNA replication and transcription.  Function  Lon protease (LONP1) is a conserved serine peptidase identified from bacteria to eukaryotic cells. In mitochondrial matrix, a majority of damaged proteins is removed via proteolysis led by Lon protease, which is an essential mechanism for mitochondrial protein quality control. For Lon protease-dependent degradation, protein substrates are first recognized and then unfolded if necessary in an ATP-dependent manner. The substrates are subsequently transferred through the pore of complex and into the proteolytic chamber of complex for degradation. ATP binding to the AAA module of the Lon complex results in a change in Lon conformation into a proteolytically active state. In general, Lon protease interacts with peptide regions(sequences) that are located within the hydrophobic core of substrates and rarely on the surface. These regions can be presented to Lon protease when proteins are damaged and lost their conformation integrity. In addition to misfolded proteins, several regulatory proteins can be processed by Lon protease by removing a degradable tag before they fully gain their biological functions. LONP1 is also a DNA-binding protein that participates in mtDNA maintenance and gene expression regulation. LONP1 degrades mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) when substrate is modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, regulating mtDNA copy number and metabolism to maintain the TFAM/mtDNA ratio necessary to control replication and transcription.  Clinical significance  Given the crucial role of LON protease in maintaining the control of mitochondrial function, its dynamics in expression under stress conditions has been found associating with human diseases and aging. For example, LONP1 expression levels are increased in different tumors and tumor cell lines. Downregulation of LONP1 in some tumor cells causes apoptosis and cell death, indicating a possible addiction of tumor cells to LONP1 function, as occurs with other intracellular proteases associated with cancer.

Neurexins are a family of proteins that function in the vertebrate nervous system as cell adhesion molecules and receptors. They are encoded by several unlinked genes of which two, NRXN1 and NRXN3, are among the largest known human genes. Three of the genes (NRXN1-3) utilize two alternate promoters and include numerous alternatively spliced exons to generate thousands of distinct mRNA transcripts and protein isoforms. The majority of transcripts are produced from the upstream promoter and encode alpha-neurexin isoforms; a much smaller number of transcripts are produced from the downstream promoter and encode beta-neurexin isoforms. The alpha-neurexins contain epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) sequences and laminin G domains, and have been shown to interact with neurexophilins. The beta-neurexins lack EGF-like sequences and contain fewer laminin G domains than alpha-neurexins. NRXN3 is thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity, and polymorphisms in NRXN3 have been linked to genetic predisposition towards a number of conditions such as alcohol or drug addiction, or obesity.

It is a grade I listed building. =Manor Hall= Manor Hall comprises a number of annexes, each of which is less than a one minute's walk from the main building. The main hall was erected between 1927 and 1932 as a women's hall of residence in the grounds of its present annex Manor House, from which the Hall takes its name. The main building houses around 150 students, with music room, library, common room, bar, and computer room, all of which are accessible to all of the hall’s residents. The hall owes its existence to the generosity of the Wills family, and was designed by the architect Sir George Oatley, who also designed the Wills Memorial Building, and Wills Hall, both of which belong to the university. This annexe came to the university in 1919, again through the generosity of the Wills family, although it has its roots in the early 18th century. Over the years it has gone through many changes. In the 19th century it was successively the home of two notable scientists, Dr William Budd, F.R.S., who discovered the origins of typhoid, and Professor John Beddoes, F.R.S., a social anthropologist who wrote The Races of Man. Manor House was extensively refurbished by the University in the summers of 1997 and 1998, and officially reopened in April 1999. Sinclair House Richmond house is one of the oldest houses in Clifton, being built between 1701 and 1703. This building has an extensive history; it used to be a boarding school for boys, as well as being the home of the Revd Mr Smith and his large family of maiden daughters, one of whom became one of the first ladies on the city council in Bristol (1920), and one of the first female J.P.s. The building is an English Heritage Grade II listed building. 2, 3 and 4 Tottenham Place are houses which were built in the 1830s. The houses were named after a local resident, Ponsonby Tottenham, a relative of the then Marquess of Ely. They came into the University's possession in the 1940s and 1950s. Sinclair House is the most modern addition to Manor Hall’s annexes, built partly on the site of Holland Cottage, destroyed during the extensive German air raids of November 1940. The house was opened in 1978 and named after the Rt. Hon. The Lady Sinclair of Cleeve. Stoke Bishop halls=Durdham Hall= Durdham Hall is the newest of the halls of residence located in the Stoke Bishop site of the University of Bristol. It houses 220 undergraduate students. The hall is designed in the traditional 'Oxbridge' style in that it is built around a central quadrangle. Durdham Hall is split into four blocks (A-D) with each block being further divided into flats of five to seven people. Each flat has a large communal lounge/kitchen and all bedrooms are single en suite. The hall boasts a modern bar, which is the largest of all the bars in the Stoke Bishop halls, known as the Badger Bar, in homage to the badger sett that once occupied the site (the badgers have since been moved to a man-made sett adjacent to the hall). There is also a computer room, laundrette and music room with a keyboard. =Wills Hall= Wills Hall was officially opened by Sir Winston Churchill, who was then the Chancellor of the University, in December 1929. It was built on a site around a nineteenth-century house called Downside which had been constructed in the style known as Strawberry Hill Gothic and which is now the Warden’s house. The Hall was designed by Sir George Oatley who was also responsible for many other fine buildings in the University and the City. The cost of the building was met by Sir George Wills, in memory of his brother Henry Herbert Wills who originally presented the site to the University – both of whom were sons of Henry Overton Wills, the first Chancellor of the University. The original Downside House was extended to form the east side of the Quadrangle (now known as Old Quad houses A to M). The panelled first floor dining room with common rooms beneath (now including the JCR Bar) was built at the same time. The adornments of this building include the grotesque figures. In 1930 a Chapel was added, the gift of Dame Monica Wills, the childless widow of Henry Herbert Wills. The grounds also include tennis and basketball courts, as well as a croquet lawn. To these original buildings new accommodation was added in 1961 when an \\"L\\" shaped block known as XYZ was built. This was designed to form one part of a New Quad which was completed when UVW was opened in 1990. As well as providing over a hundred further rooms, all with en suite facilities, a Conference centre was built at the same time, which includes a room capable of seating up to 200 people. =University Hall= University Hall was constructed in 1971 and was the first self-catering Hall of Residence built on the Stoke Bishop site and accommodates around 300 students. The majority of students are accommodated in the six original buildings that comprise 12 flats each except for one block which contains 6 flats. These blocks providing five standard, single study-bedrooms with shared facilities. In 1992 an additional cottage-style building was added to the site. This building comprises eight flats and the accommodation is arranged into six en-suite single study-bedrooms with a shared kitchen/diner. The facilities include a large social area, bar, TV room, computer room, a study, music practice and entertainment room, terrace area and launderette. The Hall is a five-minute walk from the main University sports ground and also shares sports facilities such as squash, tennis and croquet courts on the Stoke Bishop site. The Hall is within a five-minute walk of the Downs. Clifton and Durdham Downs make up more than of grassland stretching from the very cliffs of the Avon Gorge to the edges of the Victorian-built suburbs. =Hiatt Baker Hall= The Holmes and part of the University of Bristol Botanic Garden. Hiatt Baker Hall contains both catered hall, and a self-catered new build section, completed in 2014. Together Hiatt Baker 1 and 2 house over 700 undergraduate students (the largest number of any University of Bristol Hall). The older buildings were designed by Sir Percy Thomas and Son in the 1960s. Hiatt Baker is named after the eminent biologist Hiatt Cowles Baker. H.C. Baker came from a 19th-century rags-to-riches story. His father, William M. Baker, started out bankrupt and destitute, moving to Bristol to find his fortune. He eventually become owner of Baker, Baker & Co., a department store of sorts, within the vicinity of the old castle grounds. It was through the Baker family that the link between the University of Bristol and the Holmes, now the site of the University of Bristol Botanic Garden, was forged; W.M. Baker rented the Holmes when the family's fortunes improved. The site then stayed within the tenancy of the Baker family, until acquired by the University in 1943. Hiatt Cowles Baker sat on the committee that obtained a royal charter for the University of Bristol, and later became Pro-Chancellor between 1929 and 1934. The Warden is Dr Nicholas Howden and the Deputy Wardens are Miles Taylor and Steve Bourke. Also available on site within the main block is \\"Source\\" cafe. =Churchill Hall= Churchill Hall in 2007 Churchill Hall is one of the halls of residence located in the Stoke Bishop site of the University of Bristol. It houses around 350 undergraduate students. Churchill Hall is split into blocks, or 'houses' as they are more formally known (A – R & The Holmes). Blocks A-K were built in the early 50s, in two phases, around a large split level quadrangle. The main block (K) houses a library/reading room, bar, table tennis room, piano room, dining hall, computer room, laundrette, the porters lodge, and the largest Junior Common Room in terms of floorspace of the Stoke Bishop Halls. Blocks M-R are the 'new' blocks. These feature significantly smaller rooms than those around old quad, yet share three bathrooms between every 8 rooms, and a small kitchenettes with microwaves, fridges and a sink. As part of the 'new block' redevelopment, a new student building, the 'hexagon', was added. This is a small building at the back of the main block which houses a Queen Anne snooker table. The 'old' blocks are joined together in various formations. AB and IJ form two opposing self-contained large 'houses'. These blocks have the largest rooms apart from The Holmes. They have washbasins. Bathrooms are between 6 people per floor. CDE and FGH form longer 'blocks' with rooms the same size as AB/IJ. They all contain small kitchenettes, much like the M, P, Q and R blocks. They also contain washrooms on the top floors. The Holmes is a large Victorian mansion house of historical interest. It sits within the University botanical gardens opposite the hall, and is another block in Churchill sometimes used for some temporary shared rooms (although not all). The rooms vary in size but tend to be considerably larger, by up to about 4 or 5 times, than even old block rooms. It formerly belonged to Wills Hall. The hall used to contain two other Victorian residences, Waltham and Claverton Cottages, Claverton having since become the Warden's Residence and Waltham now part of the Botanic Gardens. =Badock Hall= Badock Hall is a catered and self-catered hall of residence. It offers accommodation for 443 students, comprising single study bedrooms housed in ten separate units, each supervised by a senior resident. Units 7, 8, 9 and 10 were refurbished in the summer of 2017 and units 8 and 9 became self-catered. The Hall was opened in 1964 and is named after the late Sir Stanley Hugh Badock, a former Pro- Chancellor, Treasurer and Chairman of Council of the University. Badock Hall celebrated its 50th Anniversary in December 2014 when the Chancellor of the University, Baroness Hale of Richmond unveiled a plaque and dedicated a new student activity centre, the Jubilee Building. Student Houses There are also a number of smaller residences that together make up the University of Bristol's Student Houses collection of residences. These include: =The Hawthorns= The Hawthorns A former hotel, the residence has space for just over 100 students, and is situated within the university campus. The student rooms are on the upper floors, with the ground floor offering conference facilities, a refectory, and offices. There is a big variation in room size, with half having en-suite facilities, and 4 rooms being doubles. Located adjacent to a busy bus stop used by the Wessex 16 university bus, the Hawthorns is situated such that the university sports centre and most departments are a 1-minute walk. =Hillside/Woodside= Hillside/Woodside consists of two houses interlinked, and located near Leigh Woods. It has room for 29 students, with 4 double rooms. The residence is located close to Ashton Court, home of the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta, and Clifton Suspension Bridge. =Northwell House= Located just off the Gloucester Road, Northwell House was built in 1989. It is made up of two buildings, and is split up into 22 flats, each of which can hold 4–8 students. It has the capacity for 123 students, with 30 double rooms. =115 Queens Road= Purpose built in the 1960s, and refurbished in the summer of 2008, 115 Queen's Road is directly opposite the student's union, and so has quick access to the student bar and university swimming pool. It has 41 single rooms, with 9 rooms on each floor. Two of the 5 floors are single sex, with the other three mixed. =Winkworth House= Winkworth House was built to look like a terrace of houses. It is 5 mins walk from Bristol centre, 2 mins from Park Street and 10 mins from the University Precinct. Around 120 residents arranged in mostly flats of 7 (with some smaller). Partner properties The University has a Partnership with Unite Students to provide several residences in the City Centre. In these properties the student experience, including pastoral care and social events, is managed by the University of Bristol as in all other residences, and the building management is run by Unite staff. =Unite House= Unite House is a self-catered residence situated near the Hippodrome. Unite House has a range of non-ensuite and ensuite rooms in 6 and 7 bed flats as well as studios. There is an onsite laundry, bike storage, common room, study room and courtyard. =Culver House= Culver House is a self-catered residence situated on Park Street. Culver House shares many of the facilities at Unite House and the two residences together form the University's City Centre Living residences. =Riverside collection of residences= There are three residences, close to each other on Bristol Harbour. Favell House, Waverley House and The Rackhay each have a communal reception area with sofas and a television where students gather. =Nelson House= Nelson House is located on Nelson Street in Bristol, home of the street art project, See No Evil. Nelson House is approximately fifteen minutes walk from the University campus.

Frank Sinatra had many close relationships throughout his life. He was married four times and had at least six other notable relationships in between. He had three verified children, as well as more than one of questionable relationship. Marriages=Nancy Barbato= Frank Sinatra and Nancy Barbato at Ciro's, 1949 Frank Sinatra met Nancy Rose Barbato (March 25, 1917 – July 13, 2018) when he was nineteen, and they were married on February 4, 1939, in Jersey City, New Jersey, Barbato's home town.The Rough Guide to Frank Sinatra, Chris Ingham, pg 9 Their wedding was held at Our Lady of Sorrows Church at 93 Clerk Street, after which the newlyweds resided in an apartment house at 137 Bergen Avenue. Their first child, their elder daughter Nancy Sinatra, was born on June 8, 1940, and their son, Francis Wayne Sinatra, known as Frank Sinatra Jr., was born on January 10, 1944. Both children were born at the Margaret Hague Hospital in Jersey City.\\"Frank Sinatra's Jersey City Connection\\", CityofJerseyCity.org. Accessed June 30, 2008. Following their move to Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, Sinatra errantly strayed from his marriage into extra-marital affairs, the first known with Marilyn Maxwell. These affairs also became public knowledge and caused great embarrassment to Nancy Barbato Sinatra, who considered calling off their marriage then and had an abortion when she became pregnant in 1946.Ingham, pg 10, as related in Tina Sinatra's memoir A third child, Christina Sinatra, known as \\"Tina\\", was born on June 20, 1948. Nancy Barbato Sinatra and Frank Sinatra announced their separation on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1950, with Frank's additional extra-marital affair with Ava Gardner compounding his transgressions and becoming public knowledge once again. After originally just seeking a legal separation, Frank and Nancy Sinatra decided some months later to file for divorce, and this divorce became legally final on October 29, 1951. Frank Sinatra's affair and relationship with Gardner had become more and more serious, and she later became his second wife. What was perhaps less widely known was the fact of Sinatra's continuing visits; his long, confiding late-night phone calls; and the convivial family dinners on birthdays, holidays and many other occasions. \\"Throughout the many years after they split, my grandfather came to visit whenever his crazy life would allow it,\\" Mrs. Sinatra's granddaughter A. J. Lambert wrote in a 2015 remembrance in Vanity Fair. \\"I can remember times when she would be on the phone with her ex- husband, and the next thing I knew some eggplant was coming out of the freezer to thaw so that she could make him some sandwiches when he showed up.\\" She remained profoundly private, uttering barely a word in public about her life with Sinatra, though their mutual feelings were clear, her granddaughter recalled, to those who knew them best. \\"I know he never stopped loving her,\\" Ms. Lambert wrote. \\"And I know she never stopped loving him.\\" Nancy Barbato Sinatra died in 2018 at the age of 101, she was never remarried and having outlived not only her ex-husband, but also her son Frank Jr. as well, who died in 2016. =Ava Gardner= Ava Gardner, Sinatra's wife from 1951 to 1957 Kitty Kelley claims that Sinatra had first seen photographs of Ava Gardner in a magazine and had sworn that he would marry her. Ruth Rosenthal, a friend of Gardner's, stated that Gardner initially detested him upon meeting him at MGM, finding him to be \\"conceited, arrogant and overpowering\\". Their similarities, however, from vices like smoking, drinking hard liquor and cursing, to their volatile tempers and love of violent sports, soon became apparent. Sinatra separated from Nancy on Valentine's Day 1950, after he confessed to his passionate affair with Gardner, and she subsequently locked him out of the house and hired a lawyer. Although Nancy initially refused to divorce him, Sinatra was eventually granted a divorce in Nevada in October 1951, and subsequently obtained a marriage license in Pennsylvania, marrying Gardner in a small ceremony on November 7, 1951. Following a turbulent marriage, with many well-publicized fights and altercations and an abortion in November 1952, the couple formally announced their separation October 29, 1953 through MGM. Gardner filed for divorce in June 1954, at a time when she was dating matador Luis Miguel Dominguín, but the divorce was not settled until July 1957. Sinatra blamed Peter Lawford for the split, who had dated Gardner before, and it took six years for Sinatra to forgive him. He was inconsolable in the fall of 1953 after the split, and according to Kelley, on November 18, Van Heusen found him in the elevator of his 57th Street apartment with his wrists slashed. Sinatra took responsibility for Gardner's business affairs long after the split, and was still dealing with her finances in 1976. When she fell into ill health in later years, Sinatra paid $50,000 towards her medical bills. Gardner's power in Hollywood helped Sinatra get cast in From Here to Eternity (1953) and his subsequent Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor helped revitalize Sinatra's film career.Ingham, pg41 =Mia Farrow= Sinatra married actress Mia Farrow on July 19, 1966, when she was 21 and he was 50. At the time, Sinatra was enjoying a wave of renewed popularity as the song \\"Strangers in the Night\\" returned him to the top of the Billboard charts only seventeen days later. They met on the set of Sinatra's film, Von Ryan's Express.Ingham, p. 80 She agreed to appear in his 1968 film, The Detective, but when she reneged as her filming schedule for Rosemary's Baby overran, Sinatra served her divorce papers in front of the cast and crew.Ingham, p. 81 They were divorced in Mexico in August 1968. In an interview for the November 2013 issue of Vanity Fair, Farrow said that she and Sinatra \\"never really split up\\" and answered \\"possibly\\" when asked if her son Ronan might be Sinatra's.\\"Exclusive: Mia Farrow and Eight of Her Children Speak Out on Their Lives, Frank Sinatra, and the Scandals They've Endured\\" . Vanity Fair. October 2, 2013. =Barbara Marx= On July 11, 1976, Sinatra married Barbara Blakeley Marx (1927-2017) (formerly married to Zeppo Marx, the straight man in the Marx brothers' actNash, Eric P. \\"Books in Brief: Nonfiction\\", The New York Times, February 18, 2001. Accessed January 7, 2008. \\"Sinatra's last wife, Barbara Marx, who had been married to Zeppo, the unfunny Marx brother, is depicted as the wicked stepmother, isolating the aging star from friends and family, persuading him to change his will and failing to notify the children in his last hours.\\"), who converted to Catholicism to marry him. She remained his wife until his death, although her relations with Sinatra's children were consistently portrayed as stormy, something Nancy Sinatra confirmed when she publicly claimed that Barbara had not bothered to call Frank's children even when the end was near, although they were close by, and the children missed the opportunity to be at their father's bedside when he died. Relationships Sinatra had numerous extra-marital affairs, the first of which was with blonde starlet Alora Gooding from October 1940 while in Hollywood, his \\"first big love away from home\\" according to Nick Sevano. Next followed Rita Maritt, a 16-year-old Long Island debutante, the daughter of an oil baron, and Mary Lou Watts, a wealthy socialite. Gossip magazines published details of affairs with the likes of Lana Turner and Marilyn Maxwell. =Lana Turner= Summers and Swan claimed that Turner had gushed of a \\"very serious affair\\" between the two, and that they had only faked splitting up their relationship to oblige to MGM's concerns. Turner later denied the claims in her 1992 autobiography, saying that \\"the closest things to dates Frank and I enjoyed were a few box lunches at MGM\\". =Judy Garland= The Frank Sinatra Show on CBS Radio Sinatra and Judy Garland remained good friends until her death in 1969, but on only two occasions were the two legendary singers romantically involved. The first was in 1949, when Garland was recovering from a nervous breakdown and the two went on a romantic rendezvous in the Hamptons (Garland was still married to director Vincente Minnelli). The second was during one of Garland's many separations from her third husband Sid Luft in 1955. Sinatra had just come off his messy separation from Ava Gardner and was spotted in Garland's company until Luft found out. =Lauren Bacall= Sinatra was very close to Lauren Bacall. According to Kelley, her husband Humphrey Bogart believed that Sinatra was in love with Bacall and failed to attend the Sands on Bacall's 32nd birthday out of jealousy, though the two men were on good terms. Sinatra and Bacall were frequently seen together in public throughout 1957, and on March 11, 1958, they reportedly became engaged, though Sinatra denied intending to marry her. =Juliet Prowse= Sinatra was also engaged to India- born South African actress and dancer Juliet Prowse for a short while from fall 1961 to early 1962, before Sinatra broke the engagement late that year because Prowse refused to give up her career. The two first met on the set of the 1960 film Can-Can. =Marilyn Monroe = Sinatra met Marilyn Monroe in 1954 (while he was still married to Ava Gardner, although some sources say that Sinatra and Monroe first met several years earlier) and was a friend of Monroe's second husband Joe DiMaggio, and after DiMaggio and Monroe divorced, he joined his friend DiMaggio and the writer James Bacon on a raid set up by DiMaggio himself in pursuit of his ex-wife (Monroe) and her lover Hal Schafer, and instead of raiding their apartment, they raided the apartment of another woman, whose name was Florence Kotz. In summer of 1961, Sinatra saw Monroe again and began an affair with her, and Monroe talked about marrying Sinatra, but Sinatra broke off the affair in fall of 1961 (around the same time he saw Juliet Prowse). =Angie Dickinson= Sinatra was romantically involved with Angie Dickinson off and on for ten years from around 1954 to 1964. \\"We had an incredible 'like' for each other\\" and \\"a very comfortable relationship\\", stated Dickinson in 1999, adding that if they'd had \\"a burning love affair\\" then the romance might not have lasted as long. The two remained friends until Sinatra's 1998 death. Children Sinatra had three children with his first wife, Nancy Barbato: Nancy Sinatra (born June 8, 1940), Frank Sinatra Jr. (born January 10, 1944 and died March 16, 2016), and Christina \\"Tina\\" Sinatra (born June 20, 1948). Although Sinatra did not remain faithful to his wife, he was by many accounts a devoted father. On December 8, 1963, Frank Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped. Sinatra paid the kidnappers' $240,000 ransom demand (even offering $1,000,000 though the kidnappers bizarrely turned down this offer), and his son was released unharmed on December 10. Because the kidnappers demanded that Sinatra call them only from pay phones, Sinatra carried a roll of dimes with him throughout the ordeal, and this became a lifetime habit. The kidnappers were subsequently apprehended and convicted. A movie called Stealing Sinatra was made about the incident. The radio program This American Life interviewed one of the kidnappers, Barry Keenan, in the 2002 episode \\"Plan B\\". Julie Sinatra (born Julie Ann Maria Lyma on February 10, 1943) claims to be Sinatra's daughter through an unacknowledged affair that he had with a showgirl, Dorothy Bunocelli, in the 1940s. She legally changed her last name to Sinatra in 2000.http://www.dougiethompson.com/frank-sinatra.htm Interview with Julie Sinatra Awarded $100,000 by the Sinatra estate in 2002, elements of her story concerning her mother's trip to Cuba with Sinatra have been disputed. Actress Eva Bartok claimed that her daughter Deana's biological father was actually Frank Sinatra, with whom she had a brief affair in 1956. In an interview for the November 2013 issue of Vanity Fair, Mia Farrow said that she and Sinatra \\"never really split up\\" and answered \\"possibly\\" when asked if her son Ronan Farrow might be Sinatra's. Personality Sinatra in 1957 In his spare time, Sinatra enjoyed listening to classical music, and would attend concerts when he could. He also liked opera, particularly Luciano Pavarotti, and told himself, \\"I'm just a wop baritone. This guy can really sing\\". In return, music critic Henry Pleasants said that he had rarely interviewed an opera singer who did not have a collection of Sinatra's recordings. Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that Sinatra had \\"great inner strength\\", and that his energy and drive was \\"enormous\\". A workaholic, he reportedly only slept for four hours a night on average. Rojek considers him to have been an \\"overtly sexual performer, caressing the microphone and standing in a suggestive manner\\". Impeccable with his dress and cleanliness, while with the Tommy Dorsey band he developed the nickname \\"Lady Macbeth\\", because of frequent showering and switching his outfits. He enjoyed golf, and would often play with golf champion Ken Venturi at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived. Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that \\"I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation\\". Avoiding solitude and unglamorous surroundings at all costs, he struggled with the conflicting need \\"to get away from it all, but not too far away.\\" Anthony Quinn once stated that he had a \\"cruel streak in his personality\\", but that he still loved him as he was \\"what all men are and not one man in a million ever is\\". Sinatra's mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists and photographers. He received negative press for fights with Lee Mortimer in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser in Houston in 1950, and Judy Garland's publicist Jim Byron in 1954, whom he reportedly referred to as a \\"fucking parasite\\". Yet Sinatra was known for his generosity, particularly after his comeback. When Lee J. Cobb nearly died from a heart attack in June 1955, Sinatra flooded him with \\"books, flowers, delicacies\\", paid his hospital bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his finest acting was yet to come. In another instance, after a heated argument with manager Bobby Burns, rather than apologize, Sinatra bought him a brand new Cadillac. In a 1963 interview with Playboy magazine, Sinatra stated that his belief in God was similar to Albert Schweitzer, Bertrand Russell and Albert Einstein in that had a \\"respect for life – in any form\\", but did not believe in \\"a personal God to whom I look for comfort or for a natural on the next roll of the dice\\". According to Kelley, he was critical of the church on numerous occasions, and had thought it hypocritical in Hoboken that Italians had to attend a different church from the Irish and Germans. Though turned off by organized religion at times, however, Sinatra had a deep faith that became public when he turned to the Catholic Church for healing after his mother died in a plane crash late in his career. He died as a practicing Catholic and had a Catholic burial. Cal Neva Lodge In 1960, Sinatra bought a share in the Cal Neva Lodge & Casino, straddling the border between Nevada and California on the shores of Lake Tahoe. Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted the likes of the other Rat Pack members, Red Skelton, Marilyn Monroe, Victor Borge, Joe E. Lewis, Lucille Ball, Lena Horne, Juliet Prowse, the McGuire Sisters and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% share in the hotel. Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the Nevada Gaming Control Board in 1963 after mobster Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises. Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission and mobster control of casinos, and trouble with the Mafia, Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands. Alleged organized-crime links Mugshot of mobster Lucky Luciano in 1936 Sinatra became the stereotype of the \\"tough working-class Italian American\\", something which he embraced. He commented that he would \\"probably have ended in a life of crime\\" if it had not been for his interest in music. According to one writer, Eddie Fisher once remarked that Sinatra \\"wanted to be a hood\\" and had once told him that \\"I'd rather be a don of the Mafia than president of the United States\\". However, Peter Lawford had said that Sinatra only referred to them as the \\"boys\\" or \\"the Outfit\\", rather than the \\"Mafia\\". In Sinatra's early days, mafia boss Willie Moretti helped him for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing him from his contract with Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra was present at the Mafia Havana Conference in 1946, and one newspaper published the headline \\"Shame, Sinatra\\" regarding his connection with Lucky Luciano. Kelley claims that Phyllis McGuire referred to Sam Giancana and Sinatra as the \\"best of friends\\", saying that they would often play golf together in Nevada and visit each other. She also quotes Jo-Carrol Silvers in saying that both Sinatra and her husband Phil Silvers \\"adored Bugsy Siegel so much\\", and would boast to friends about him and how many people he had killed. She also claimed that Silvers had told her that \\"like Bugsy, Frank had a Mafia Redneck mentality\\", with their shared love of high-living and grandiose plans in Las Vegas. Kelley claims that Sinatra and mobster Joseph Fischetti had been good friends from 1938 onward, and acted like \\"Sicilian brothers\\". She also states that Sinatra and Hank Sanicola were financial partners in the gossip magazine Hollywood Night Life with Mickey Cohen, a West Coast mobster; she claims that Sinatra funded $15,000 into the magazine to \\"get back at Hollywood\\". Mugshot of Bugsy Siegel in 1928 The FBI kept records amounting to 2,403 pages on Sinatra, becoming a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, his ardent New Deal politics, and his friendship with John F. Kennedy. They kept him under surveillance for almost five decades beginning in the 1940s. The documents include accounts of Sinatra as the target of death threats and extortion schemes. The FBI documented that Sinatra was losing esteem with the Mafia as he grew closer to President Kennedy, whose brother Bobby was leading a crackdown on organized crime. They wiretapped Giancana's conversations, and found that Giancana no longer trusted Sinatra after he had been spotted with Kennedy. Their purported friendship finally came to an end in 1963 following the Nevada Gaming Commission's investigation into the casinos. According to Kelley, Giancana blamed Sinatra for the ordeal. However, it was acknowledged that Sinatra and Kennedy's friendship started becoming strained after Kennedy took office, in part because the Kennedy Administration, which included Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General, was very anti-Mafia. It was also acknowledged that their friendship also came to an end in 1962 after Sinatra's recent meeting with mobster Sam Giancana convinced Kennedy to cancel a visit to Sinatra's home while he visited Palm Springs home and instead stay at the home of Bing Crosby, who was more willing to distance himself from the Mafia in public, despite also having mob ties.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/sinatra-snow-storms-smashed-up- helipad-story-behind-john-f- kennedys/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSinatra%20smashed%20up%20everything%20in,months%20of%20the%20inauguration%20gala. The FBI's secret dossier on Sinatra was released in 1998 in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. Sinatra frequently denied personal and professional links with organized crime figures such as Bugsy Siegel, Carlo Gambino, Sam Giancana, Lucky Luciano, and Joseph Fischetti, despite the many connections and anecdotes reported. He vehemently declared that \\"any report that I fraternised with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie\\". In January 1967, he stood before a Las Vegas grand jury investigating mobster influence in the casinos and denied any financial exploits with Giancana.

It is used as a biomarker to detect damage to the kidneys, and that may be used to help diagnose certain kidney disorders. It is found at high levels in the urine when there are kidney problems.  Function  This gene encodes the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, a zinc metallopeptidase which hydrolyzes amino acids from the N-terminus of its substrate. The protein has been localized to both the cytoplasm and to cellular membranes. This enzyme degrades enkephalins in the brain, and studies in mouse suggest that it is involved in proteolytic events regulating the cell cycle. It has been identified as a novel modifier of TAU-induced neurodegeneration with neuroprotective effects via direct proteolysis of TAU protein. The loss of NPEPPS function exacerbates neurodegeneration. Structure=Gene= The NPEPPS gene is located at chromosome 17q21, consisting of 25 exons and spanning 40 kb. =Protein= NPEPPS is a ubiquitous, 100 kDa, Zn2+ metallopeptidase highly expressed in the brain. Two isozymes have been found and they are expressed differently in the nervous system. Glu 309 is one of the active site glutamates, and its mutation could convert the enzyme into an inactive binding protein.  Function  NPEPPS has been proposed to function in a variety of processes, including metabolism of neuropeptidase, regulation of the cell cycle, and hydrolysis of proteasomal products to amino acids. NPEPPS is a major protease to digest SOD1, similar to its role in TAU-induced neurodegeneration. NPEPPS is also reported to play a role in creating and destroying MHC class Ⅰ-presented peptides and in limiting MHC class Ⅰ Ag presentation in dendritic cells. Clinical significance NPEPPS is induced in neurons expressing mutant huntingtin and is critical in preventing the accumulation of polyglutamine in normal cells. It has been reported as the major peptidase digesting polyglutamine sequences in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s disease. It has been shown that elevation of NPEPPS activity in vivo could effectively block accumulation of hyperphosphorylated TAU protein and thus slow down the disease progression, suggesting increasing NPEPPS activity may be a feasible therapeutic approach to eliminate accumulation of toxic substrates, which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the BAG1-related protein family. BAG1 is an anti-apoptotic protein that functions through interactions with a variety of cell apoptosis and growth related proteins including BCL-2, Raf-protein kinase, steroid hormone receptors, growth factor receptors and members of the heat shock protein 70 kDa family. This protein contains a BAG domain near the C-terminus, which could bind and inhibit the chaperone activity of Hsc70/Hsp70. This protein was found to be associated with the death domain of tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNF-R1) and death receptor-3 (DR3), and thereby negatively regulates downstream cell death signaling. The regulatory role of this protein in cell death was demonstrated in epithelial cells which undergo apoptosis while integrin mediated matrix contacts are lost.

It has grown to become the largest rock music and camping festival in New York. The festival was held at Hunter Mountain ski resort for fourteen years, usually in early June. In February 2019, organizers for the Festival announced that the festival was moving to the location of the original Woodstock festival, the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. History Mountain Jam was originally conceived to celebrate the 25th anniversary of WDST/Radio Woodstock. More than 3,300 people attended the initial one-day event in 2005, reviews of which were overwhelmingly positive.http://blogs.hudsonvalley.com/good-stuff/2014/06/04/tenth-annual- mountain-jam-begins/ The founder, Gary Chetkof, along with Warren Haynes, and members of Radio Woodstock, decided to make the event annual.http://ultimateclassicrock.com/warren-haynes-interview-2013/ Over time, the festival has grown to include a diverse lineup of smaller artists, as well as large acts including Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, Robert Plant, The Black Keys, The Lumineers, Michael Franti and Spearhead, Widespread Panic, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir,The Allman Brothers Band, Levon Helm, The Alabama Shakes, Steve Miller Band, Wilco, The Avett Brothers, Pretty Lights. Gov't Mule, the band Haynes co-founded, performed at every Mountain Jam until 2016. Venue Mountain Jam's three stages allow for continuous music each day. There is a Main Stage, a 2nd Stage that showcases emerging artists, and an acoustic stage that is part of smaller Greek-style amphitheater. One of the best amenities at Bethel is that every camping spot allows for a car-side parking spot, which makes camping much easier for campers. At Hunter Mountain, The East Stage was the largest, overlooking the main terrain of the resort. Adjacent to the East Stage was the West Stage, near the resort's chair lift; and Inside the Base Lodge a third stage is set up for late night acts and musicians who require indoor amenities. Amenities for event goers include a tent camping area in the Hunter One section of the resort and RV camping farther up the mountain. Various hotels also serve the town year-round, and the Kaatskill Mountain Club hotel and Liftside Condominiums are both within walking distance of the festival. Some years have seen non-stop rain for almost the entire duration of the festival,http://liveforlivemusic.com/show-reviews/mountain-jam-ix-review- there-is-no-such-thing-as-bad-weather-only-bad-clothes/ while other events have had sunny and temperate weather.

It serves as a strategic highway through the central part of the state. Though an even- numbered U.S. Highway, which are typically signed east–west, it is signed north–south in South Carolina. In some other states along its route, it is signed east–west. The South Carolina segment is signed such that U.S. 52 north corresponds to the general westward direction of the highway, and vice versa. Route description US 52 begins at the intersection of Meeting and Line Streets, in Charleston. Going northwest along Meeting Street, it connects with I-26/US 17, followed by Morrison Drive (US 52 Spur hidden); US 52 signage begin to appear north of Morrison Drive. In North Charleston, it is concurrent with US 78 for , splitting near Goose Creek. From Moncks Corner, US 52 is briefly concurrent with US 17 Alt as it enters the Francis Marion National Forest and crosses the Dennis C. Bishop Bridge over the Tail Race Canal of the Cooper River just below Lake Moultrie. The route traverses the Francis Marion National Forest as it oontinues northward to St. Stephen. From there is proceeds to Kingstree and Lake City, before another short concurrency with US 301 from Effingham to Florence. Through downtown Florence, it goes northwest and bypasses Darlington and joining another concurrency with US 401\\\\. At Society Hill, it merges briefly with US 15 before continuing north again solo to Cheraw, where it overlaps briefly with US 1 and SC 9\\\\. US 52 crosses the North Carolina state line, after traveling through South Carolina, continuing on towards Wadesboro. US 52 is a major highway between Charleston and Florence, all of which is four-lane or more with some sections signed . North of Darlington, it becomes mostly a two-lane rural highway through the remainder of its route. Though the majority of its routing and signage is north-south, some sections will also be signed east-west at various parts of the state. =Dedicated and memorial names= US 52 in South Carolina feature a few dedicated or memorialized stretches of freeway. * Blue Star Memorial Highway - Official honorary name of US 52 in Berkeley County. Markers are located in Moncks Corner, Pineville, and St. Stephen. * L. Lawson Rhodes Highway - Is a dedicated section of US 52 located in Chesterfield County. Dedicated in August, 2013, it is in honor of Patrolman L. Lawson Rhodes, who served as a trooper with the South Carolina Highway Patrol, who died on duty in 1938. History US 52 was established in 1935 as a renumbering of US 601 from the North Carolina state line to Florence and US 17 from Florence to Charleston. In 1939, US 52 was rerouted into a concurrency with US 78 in North Charleston, leaving a section of Meeting Street. Also in the same year, Cheraw to the North Carolina state line was the last section to be paved; while the first section of US 52 was widen to four-lane from Charleston to Durant Avenue, in North Charleston. In 1940, US 52 was rerouted onto new alignment west of Lake City. In 1948, US 52 was taken off King Street and placed on Meeting Street to Lee Street, in Charleston. Around 1952-1969, US 52 was split during that period in Florence, with northbound along Irby Street and southbound along Coit Avenue; before and after it was solely on Irby Street. Also around 1952, US 52 was bypassed west of Kingstree on new primary routing; the old route through town remained part of SC 261 while Academy Street, Kelly Street and Third Avenue were downgraded to secondary roads (all three SC-45-8). In 1971, US 52 was moved onto new alignment south of Moncks Corner, leaving behind Old Highway 52 (S-8-791).

He soon moved on to Winsford United, who he played for until Bolton Wanderers gave him his first Football League chance when they signed him in April 1984. Came became a regular for Wanderers over the next four years, winning promotion from Division Four in 1987–88. But a broken leg early in the 1988–89 season after a tackle by Chester City's striker Ian Benjamin ruled him out for more than a year thus ending interest in him by Arsenal, Ipswich Town and Everton. After this Came struggled to re- establish himself in the Bolton side and in December 1992 he ironically moved across the north-west to Chester. Although Came was unable to save Chester from relegation to Division Three in his first season with the club, he helped them win promotion straight back the following season. The campaign memorably saw him deputise in goal for almost the entire 90 minutes away at Scarborough when regular goalkeeper Billy Stewart suffered an injury in the warm-up. Came kept a clean sheet as Chester won 1–0 and he struck up a solid central defensive pairing with Colin Greenall as City sealed the runners-up spot.

RICS has two known isoforms, RICS that are expressed primarily at neurite growth cones, and at the post synaptic membranes, and PX-RICS which is more widely expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and endosomes. The only known domain of the RICS is the RhoGAP domain, whilst PX- RICS has an additional Phox homology and SH3 domain.  Function  RICS (a.k.a. GRIT/Arhgap32) is a neuron-associated GTPase-activating protein that may regulate dendritic spine morphology and strength by modulating Rho GTPase activity.  Isoforms = RICS = Experiments have shown that knocking down RICS, or just knocking out its GAP or C-terminal TrkA binding site, results in abnormally extended neurites, and blocks NGF regulated outgrowth. The GAP activity of RICS is known to be regulated by two phosphorylation sites, one controlled by CaMKII, and the other by RPTPa. When CaMKII is activated by Ca2+ entry through NMDA receptors and inactivates RICS through phosphorylation, which in turn increases the active GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1. This would thereby induce, for example, remodeling of dendritic spines. Because it has been shown in some experiments that Cdc42 does not affect spine morphology, whilst others have shown that Rac1 does (via the PAK1, LIMK, CFL1 pathway), the most likely pathway is via Rac1. That RACS also binds to β-catenin and N-cadherins, in vivo within the PSD (which it binds to through PSD-95, and weak binding to the NR2 subunits) suggests that there may be another pathway for it modifying spine structure as well. The RPTPa controlled phosphorylation site controls the specificity of the GAP activity, through a mechanism thought to involve movement of the c-terminal region of RICS. In the phosphorylated state, RICS can affect Rac, Rho and Cdc42, but after dephosphorylation by RPTPa it can only affect Rac. A further phosphorylation site, regulated by FYN controls the binding of RPTPa to RICS. = PX-RICS = PX-RICS is the dominant isoform expressed during nervous system development. It is known to have much lower GAP activity than RICS. Although it is more generally expressed than RICS, it is still known to inhibit neuronal elongation. Furthering the idea that it is a synaptically relevant isoform is that it is known to bind NR2B and PSD95 in vivo. PX-RICS is known to be involved in transport of certain synaptic proteins which lack ER export signals, from the endoplasmic reticulum, to the Golgi apparatus. This has been shown for the β-catenin and N-cadherin, the later of which lacks the ER export signal, and the former which binds the later within the ER as a necessary but not sufficient part of its export process. PX-RICS was found to be a necessary component for the export of this complex to the Golgi and then onwards to the cellular membrane. PX-RICS is thought to do this by first localizing to the ER membrane---this it does by binding to GABARAP which binds ER, and through its Phox homology domain, which has a high binding affinity for Pi4P, the predominant phosphoinositide in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. PX-RICS is then thought to bind a heterodimer of the 14-3-3 proteins encoded by YWHAZ and YWHAQ genes. The site were this binding occurs is a RSKSDP site in PX-RICS c-terminal, which is phosphorylated by CAMKII to encourage the binding. It has also now been shown that membrane transport of FGFR4, a N-Cadherin binding protein, is affected by PX-RICS knockdown.

Background  It is not known when Wang Fangqing was born, but it is known that his family was from Tang Dynasty's capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (雍州, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). He came from a line of officials who had served during Jin Dynasty (265-420) and the subsequent Southern Dynasties Liu Song, Southern Qi, and Liang Dynasty, until his great- grandfather Wang Bao () surrendered to Northern Zhou when Northern Zhou forces captured the then-Liang capital Jiangling in 554. Wang Bao and his descendants thereafter served as officials of Northern Zhou and its successors Sui Dynasty and Tang. Wang Fangqing's father Wang Hongzhi () successively served as advisor to Li Yuanchang () the Prince of Han and Li Yuanjing () the Prince of Jing, sons of Tang's founder Emperor Gaozu. Wang Fangqing himself started his official service at age 15, when he served on the military staff of Li Zhen the Prince of Yue, a son of Emperor Taizong (Emperor Gaozu's son and successor). He studied the Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han under Li Zhen's secretary Ren Xigu (), and later, when Ren became a staff member of the crown prince,As the timing of Ren's movement was not further elaborated in historical records, it is not clear which crown prince was involved. Wang followed him and continued to study under him. During Emperor Taizong's successor Emperor Gaozong's Yongchun era (682-683), Wang was promoted to be the deputy minister of husbandry (太僕少卿, Taipu Shaoqing), and on one occasion, when Emperor Gaozong was considering creating his grandson Li Chongzhao the unprecedented title of deputy crown prince (皇太孫, Huang Taisun), he consulted Wang, who opined that the action was unprecedented and yet Emperor Gaozong could, if he so wanted, create a new tradition. After Emperor Gaozong's death later in 683, his powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian) became empress dowager and regent successively over their sons Emperor Zhongzong (whom she deposed in 684) and Emperor Ruizong. During her regency, Wang became the commandant at Guang Prefecture (廣州, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong). Guang Prefecture was at that point becoming increasingly important as a port of international trade, and Wang's predecessor Lu Yuanrui () was assassinated in 684 by Malay merchants after he had improperly seized their merchandise. After Wang succeeded Lu, he was said to be honest and clean, never taking bribes. Moreover, within his territory, there had long been tribal leaders who had received special treatment and who were corrupt, who in turn kept their corruption going by bribing the officials. Wang ordered the officials to stop associating with the tribal leaders and arrested the most corrupt of the tribal leaders. The public sentiment at the time believed that since the start of Tang, there had not been anyone who had governed Guang Prefecture better than Wang, and Empress Dowager Wu issued an edict honoring his achievements.  During Wu Zetian's reign  In 695, Wu Zetian, who by that point had taken the throne from Emperor Ruizong as \\"emperor,\\" establishing a new Zhou Dynasty and interrupting Tang, recalled Wang Fangqing to serve as the secretary general of the then-capital prefecture Luo Prefecture (洛州, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan). She soon gave him the honorific title of Yinqing Guanglu Daifu () and created him the Baron of Shiquan. In 696, she made him the secretary general at Bing Prefecture (并州, roughly modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and created him the Baron of Langye—but even before he departed for Bing Prefecture, made him instead Luantai Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (鸞臺, Luantai). She also gave him the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. His office was soon changed to be Fengge Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau (鳳閣, Fengge), and he remained chancellor de facto with the Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi designation. In 697, after Wu Youyi () the Prince of Jian'an, the grandson of Wu Zetian's uncle Wu Shirang (), had returned victoriously from a campaign against Khitan forces, tradition called for the playing of a military band as Wu Youyi returned to the capital Luoyang. The chancellor Wang Jishan, as the month that Wu Youyi was returning was the same month when Emperor Gaozong died, requested that the band be only present but not playing. Wang Fangqing, citing precedents from Jin Dynasty, argued that the band should only not play if Wu Youyi were returning on the same day of Emperor Gaozong's death, advocated that the band still play, and Wu Zetian agreed. Around the same time, there was an occasion when Wu Zetian was visiting Yuquan Temple () at Mount Wan'an (萬安山, near Luoyang). The path up the mountain was steep, and she considered going up the mountain in a litter. Wang Fangqing advocated against it, arguing that it was too dangerous for the sovereign to take such a journey, and she agreed. Later that year, she upgraded his title to Viscount of Shiquan. Also around the same time, there was a discussion as to whether the ceremony of having the emperor personally declare the start of each month should be abolished as not being referred to in the Confucian classics. Wang Fangqing advocated that the ceremonies be kept in place, and Wu Zetian agreed. Wang kept a large collection of books at his mansion, and on one occasion, Wu Zetian visited his mansion to request to see some of his ancestors' calligraphy. Wang stated that his family had previously already submitted the calligraphy of Wang Xizhi (of another line of his clan) to Emperor Taizong, but that he was willing to submit the calligraphy of his 11th generation ancestor Wang Dao as well as 27 other ancestors' calligraphy. Wu Zetian displayed the calligraphy to the officials and had an official of the legislative bureau, Cui Rong (), collect them into a collection, and then awarded the collection back to Wang, considered a great honor at the time. In 698, the chancellor Di Renjie advocated recalling Li Zhe the Prince of Luling (the former Emperor Zhongzong) from exile—a suggestion that Wang Jishan and Wang Fangqing concurred in, and was also advocated by Wu Zetian's close advisor Ji Xu and her lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong. Wu Zetian agreed and recalled Li Zhe from exile, and soon created him crown prince. Later that year, Wang Fangqing, on account of failing health, requested a less important position, and Wu Zetian made him the director of the imperial library (麟臺監, Lintai Jian), no longer chancellor. Once Li Zhe (whose name was then changed to Li Xian) was made crown prince, she also made Wang Fangqing a member of his staff. In 699, she created him the Duke of Shiquan and ordered that his salary be the same as if he were still a chancellor, and also ordered him to teach Li Xian in his studies. He died in 702 and was buried with honor. It was said, however, that as his sons did not attend to his great book collections, the collections were gradually lost after his death.

He was the father of artists Alberto and Diego Giacometti, and architect Bruno Giacometti.  Biography  He was the fourth in a family of eight children. His father, Alberto, was a baker who also ran a café. The painter, Augusto Giacometti, was his cousin. He received his primary education in Chur. It was there he developed an interest in art from observing the sculptures at the Bianchi marble works. From 1886 to 1887, he studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Munich. He had wanted to attend the Academy of Fine Arts, but was insufficiently prepared. He also took lessons at two private schools and copied Old Masters at the Alte Pinakothek. Ultimately, he decided that Munich was not right for him, so he and his friend, Cuno Amiet, went to Paris where they studied with William Adolphe Bouguereau and Joseph Nicolas Robert-Fleury at the Académie Julian until 1891, when financial difficulties forced him to return home. In a short time, he began to feel isolated there and, in the summer of 1893, went to Rome, but found little inspiration. After a brief stay in Torre del Greco, broke and ill, he once again returned to Switzerland. The following year, he met and befriended the painter Giovanni Segantini who, despite being only ten years older, became an invaluable mentor; introducing him to the beauty of mountainous landscapes and the Divisionist style. In 1898, he achieved his first major success at the Kunsthaus Zürich in a joint exhibition with his friend, Amiet, and Ferdinand Hodler.Hans Goltz In 1899, Segantini died suddenly, of peritonitis, aged only forty-one. Giacometti was deeply saddened but, in 1900, met and married Annetta Stampa (1871–1964), the daughter of a country school teacher. They had four children; their three famous sons and a daughter, Ottilia (1904–1937), who died in childbirth. In 1904, they moved to her home town of Borgonovo, a mountain village in Bergell. They spent their summers in Maloja where his friend, Segantini, had lived. He was kept busy there with numerous commissions for paintings and book illustrations. In 1908, he received an invitation from Die Brücke, an artists' group, to exhibit in Dresden. He participated in a showing by the Berlin Secession in 1911 and had his first solo exhibition at the Kunsthaus Zürich the following year. His first retrospective came in 1920. He served two terms on the , from 1918 to 1921 and from 1931 to 1932. Over the course of his career, he moved from Divisionism to Post-Impressionism, then on to Expressionism; with some works in the Symbolist and Art Nouveau styles along the way.

The databases can be disk resident and/or memory resident. RDM Server implements multi-user locking, hot database backup, and a fully ACID-compliant transaction logging system with automatic crash recovery. It is currently supported on many 32- and 64-bit enterprise and embedded operating systems. The database library can optionally be run in-process with the application, eliminating client/server remote procedure calls.  History  RDM Server was first released in 1993 as an NLM for the NetWare platform under the name RDS (Raima Database Server). It was derived from its predecessor Raima Database Manager, and subsequently renamed Velocis. The database is currently known by the name RDM Server, and is currently offered as version 8.4.  Product features = Architecture = RDM Server is a client/server database engine with an optional configuration to execute the engine in-process with the application. When in a client/server configuration, clients perform remote procedure calls (RPC) to a server on the same computer or a computer that is visible across a network. Data is converted from the native server host's format to the native client host's format when in heterogeneous environments. Since its first release in 1993, RDM Server has allowed user-defined code to be loaded dynamically into the server process as a DLL or shared library. This technology was termed extension modules and was also used as the mechanism for advanced functional modules such as Raima's SQL. = Core Database Engine = The RDM Server core engine is a derivative of Raima Database Manager, which had been released 9 years earlier. As a derivative product, the native API is a low-level C/C++ API.  C API  The native C API is an extensive library functions for all database operations. Timestamps, concurrency control, transaction control, database configuration, data navigation, and data changes are supported.  Instance Level Locking  Record instances and set instances may be locked for reading or writing. A set lock controls the ability to navigate or update the connections between owner and member records in a set instance.  Transaction Logging  The product implements a fully ACID-compliant transaction logging system with automatic recovery capability. This facility is also used for asynchronous replication.  Indexes  RDM Server supports regular B-tree based indexes. An index can contain a single or multiple segments. In addition, it supports optional indexes where the application controls the index population.  Data Storage  Databases can be disk resident, memory resident or a hybrid. In the first case, all access to disk resident structures (both data or data index information), happens through an in-memory data cache maintained by the database server sub-system. Alternatively, the application can define database structures to reside in memory. An application can also define a database with mixed disk-based or memory-resident data structures. The data definition language of the engine supports mixing different storage types for any data structure.  Data Types  RDM Server supports the following native data types: signed and unsigned 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-bit integers, UTF-8 and Unicode characters, floating point (32 and 64 bit), BLOBs (binary large objects), BCD (Binary Coded Decimal), date, time and timestamp. In addition it has native support for structs and multi-dimensional arrays based on the above list of base types.  Data Models  The product offers two data models. The network data model manages relationships between data objects through list of pointers called sets. The network model is defined to allow very flexible relationships between objects. A hierarchical structure has parent-child relationships; the network model allows for the same structure except there is no limitation on the number of parents a child has. The relational data model manages relationships between data objects through value matching, and usually primary key/foreign keys. RDM Server allows for mixing both the network model and relational model in the same database definition giving the application developer additional flexibility. = Standard Extensions = Extension modules that are automatically available in RDM Server include:  SQL  Raima's SQL is an extension that implements ANSI SQL based on the 1989 and 1992 standards. It supports the following SQL data types: char, varchar, long varchar, smallint, integer, bigint, wchar (Unicode), wvarchar, long wvarchar, float, double, real, decimal/numeric, date, time, timestamp, rowid, binary, varbianary, long varbinary, and c_data (read access to native array and struct data types). The SQL API is implemented as a SAG CLI interface giving access to the supported SQL92 standard. RDM Server has full support for ODBC v3.51, JDBC v3 and v4 through a Java type 4 implementation, ADO.Net and even PHP.  Administrative Functions  Administrative functions that allow programmatic control over users, databases, and devices, as well as administrative procedures such as backup, defragmentation and consistency checks. = Replication = Active and passive replication is also available, maintaining an identical copy of a master database for application failover. The subsystem implements an asynchronous single master multi-slave replication engine based on its supporting client–server transports (including TCP/IP). = Hot Online Backup = Administrative functions allow RDM Server to be placed into a hot backup mode so that database files can be safely copied to another permanent media. The functions can enumerate the files to be backed up and allow individual files to be \\"released\\" by the backup utility, permitting them to be written to again by the server. = Supported Platforms = The product is available both as object code and as source code, and currently supports the following target platforms: AIX, FreeBSD, HPUX, Linux (Red Hat Enterprise, and Ubuntu), MAC OS, QNX Neutrino, Solaris and Windows.  Examples of Applications  RDM Server is today used in a wide range of applications for business critical data transactions, flight control systems, medical equipment, network management systems and more.

Function  Sh2d3c is a gene on human chromosome 9 that encodes an SH2 domain containing protein known as NSP3. The mouse homologue is found on chromosome 2. The NSP (Novel SH2-containing Protein) family of proteins contains three members, NSP1, NSP2, and NSP3 (this protein), all of which have a similar architecture, with an N-terminal SH2 domain, a proline serine rich region, which contains consensus sequences for MAP kinase substrates, and a conserved C-terminus, which binds to the Cas family of adapter proteins, and also shows homology to GEF domains. NSP3 was originally identified by three independent groups of researchers. The mouse homologue of NSP3 has been shown to have two distinct isoforms, generated by alternative splicing, that are expressed in different tissues. The shorter isoform, known as Chat (Cas/Hef1 associated signal transducer) is expressed in brain, lung, heart, kidney, muscle, liver, and intestine, while the larger isoform, known as Chat-H (the \\"H\\" is for Hematopoietic), is expressed in spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. The two isoforms differ only in their N-terminus, which has been shown by one group to be important for membrane localization. Through its interaction with Hef1, Chat-H, has been shown to be an important regulator of lymphocyte adhesion, acting upstream of Rap1 in the integrin activation pathway.

In 1907, he moved to Valencia, where he began to collaborate in humor magazines and offered the first exposition of his work in 1912 in the Círculo de Bellas Artes. He subsequently founded the magazine Gutiérrez, precursor to La Codorniz. He served as the editor of the children's magazines Macaco and Macaquete. Macaco, the name of both the title character and the magazine that featured it, was started in 1928. However, it folded and the Macaco comic strip was transferred to Macaquete.Comic creator: K-Hito (Ricardo Garcia Lopez) In the process of the transfer, Macaco was featured in a continuity strip rather than in a gag strip. He also contributed to Gracia y Justicia, a periodical critical of Azaña, President of the Second Spanish Republic. He also contributed to Le Journal, Pinocho, ABC, Blanco y Negro, El Debate, Ya, Informaciones, Ahora. He became famous through his caricatures in the newspaper known as El Debate. With Joaquín Xaudaró and Antonio Got, he founded the Sociedad Española de Dibujos Animados (SEDA) in 1932.The Animated Cartoon Factory - History of Animation Timeline Most of the films produced by SEDA have been lost, although there exist some copies of the film \\"Falsa noticia de fútbol\\". During the Spanish Civil War, he lived in Valencia, and worked there as a professor of calligraphy at the Academia Comercial Morales. He worked under his real name; using his pseudonym was dangerous, as he had published under it a number of articles lampooning the milicianos, or anti-fascist militias. In 1940, he founded the weekly magazine Dígame, serving as its editor. Collaborating with him at Dígame and Gutiérrez were Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Edgar Neville, Miguel Mihura, José López Rubio and (Antonio Lara de Gavilán). He also collaborated with Gabriel Miró. K-Hito also worked as a bullfighting critic (as a boy he had wanted to be a bullfighter), and his work appeared in bullfighting chronicles (crónicas taurinas). He is credited with reconciling two bitter enemies, the bullfighters Manolete and Carlos Arruza, who at K-Hito’s instigation, hugged one another in the cartoonist’s natal town of Villanueva del Arzobispo.

It was from 1893 to the 1910s the principal residence of writer Hamlin Garland (1860–1940).Homestead: The Hamlin Garland Collection Garland was a prominent and well-regarded writer of regional fiction. Designated a National Historic Landmark, it is now a museum managed by the local historical society. History Hamlin Garland was born in West Salem in a log cabin in September 1860 on a farm his father bought a year earlier.Newlin, Keith. Hamlin Garland: A Life. University of Nebraska Press, 2008: 12. When he was older, he moved away from Wisconsin and lived elsewhere, particularly in Massachusetts, Iowa, and Illinois. Even so, Garland fondly remembered the place of his birth. As he later recalled: \\"My Wisconsin birthplace has always been a source of deep satisfaction to me. That a lovely valley should form the first picture in my childhood memories is a priceless endowment... It will always remain a charming and mysterious place to me.\\"D'Ambrosio, Brian. A Wee Bit of Wisconsin. Jabberwocky Press, 2010: 26. 9780557373758 Garland returned to West Salem in 1893 and, using royalties from his successful collection of short stories Main-Travelled Roads (1891), he purchased this home.Brown, Alan. Ghosts Along the Mississippi River. University Press of Mississippi, 2011: 203. The house, which stood on four acres, had been built in the same year of Garland's birth by a mason and carpenter named William Hull. Hull sold the home to Rublee Hayes five years later and, by the time Garland bought it from Hayes, the property also included a two-story barn, cow pasture, pig-pen, and gardens of both fruits and flowers.Newlin, Keith. Hamlin Garland: A Life. University of Nebraska Press, 2008: 175. The home was in poor condition and Garland spent much of October 1893 repairing and renovating; he eventually installed indoor plumbing, making it the first home in the area with that innovation. He originally named it Mapleshade because of the three large maples on the property. Garland brought his parents with him to the home; his mother was impressed with the area right away but his father did not immediately approve. Even so, Garland noted: \\"This is my choice. Right here we take root. This shall be the Garland Homestead.\\"Newlin, Keith. Hamlin Garland: A Life. University of Nebraska Press, 2008: 175–176. The house was damaged by fire in 1912 but was quickly repaired. It was an October morning and Garland was awakened by the screams of his wife, Zulime. After attempting to stop the flames with a garden hose, he ran into his study and saved his manuscripts by throwing them from the second-floor window of his study to a neighbor below.Newlin, Keith. Hamlin Garland: A Life. University of Nebraska Press, 2008: 300. The Garlands lived in this house less frequently after about 1916, when they also had a residence in New York City, and sold it in 1939. Garland died at age 79, at his home in Hollywood, California on March 4, 1940. He had asked his ashes to be spread on the hillsides of his West Salem home. Instead, local officials asked to have him buried in the town's Nehonoc Cemetery.Holden, Greg. The Booklover's Guide to the Midwest: A Literary Tour. Cincinnati, OH: Clerisy Press, 2010: 274. Modern history The homestead in 1971 The home was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1971. and The street it is on was renamed in honor of the author. Today, the property is managed by the West Salem Historical Society and is open to the public as a museum. In 1960, a historical marker was placed in town in honor of Garland noting his interest in the region. There are some reports that the home is haunted, possibly by Garland himself due to his unhappiness that his wishes for burial were not followed.Brown, Alan. Ghosts Along the Mississippi River.

History Established in 1935 when US 220 was extended south from Virginia; it replaced: US 311/NC 77 from the state line to Madison, US 411/NC 704 from Madison to Greensboro, US 411/NC 70 from Greensboro to Candor, US 411/NC 170 from Candor to Norman, and US 15/NC 75 from Norman to Rockingham. By 1939, US 220 was realigned west of Seagrove, leaving Old US Highway 220 and an extension of NC 705. By 1963, US 220 bypassed Madison and Mayodan, the old route through the towns became US 220 Business. Between 1964-1966, Stoneville was bypassed to its west. Between 1967-1968, US 220 was realigned west, onto new freeway, of Asheboro, leaving US 220 Business. In 1970, US 220 was rerouted in Greensboro, from Randleman Road it overlapped with Interstate 85 then onto O. Henry Boulevard (in concurrency with US 29) going north till Wendover Avenue, then west to Battleground Avenue; the original alignment through downtown Greensboro became unnumbered. In the 1970s, US 220 was continuously moved onto new freeway, bypassing Randleman and Level Cross. Also, at some point during the decade, US 220 was extended south to its current terminus with US 1, leaving behind Ellerbe Road in Rockingham. In 1980, US 220 was moved onto new freeway between Steeds and Emery, its old alignment became US 220 Alternate. Between 1981-1983, US 220 moved onto new freeway from Level Cross to Interstate 85, leaving an unnumbered Randleman Road. In 1995, US 220 was moved onto new freeway between Interstate 85 to Interstate 40. In May 1997, US 220 was moved onto new freeway between Ether and NC 134; it not only extended US 220 Alternate over the old alignment, but also became the first section of both Interstate 73 and Interstate 74.

In Asheboro, it went along Fayetteville Street, then continued north on Randleman Road and on Old Randleman Road into Greensboro. Through Greensboro, US 411 was routed along Randleman Road, O'Connor Street, Elm Street, and Battleground Road; in 1934, it was rerouted north of Elm Street to Wendover Avenue, Winstead Place, Northwood Street, and Battleground Road.

Since February 2018, authors writing on the Rhynie chert have begun using the more correct form. See and other papers in the same issue of that journal.) was the sporophyte generation of a diplohaplontic, pre-vascular, axial, free-sporing land plant of the Lower Devonian (Pragian stage, around ). It had anatomical features intermediate between those of the bryophytes and vascular plants or tracheophytes. A. major was first described by Kidston and Lang in 1920 as the new species Rhynia major. The species is known only from the Rhynie chert in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where it grew in the vicinity of a silica-rich hot spring, together with a number of associated vascular plants such as a smaller species Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii which may be interpreted as a representative of the ancestors of modern vascular plants and Asteroxylon mackei, which was an ancestor of modern clubmosses (Lycopsida). Description Aglaophyton major The stems of Aglaophyton were round in cross-section, smooth, unornamented, and up to about 6mm in diameter. Kidston and Lang interpreted the plant as growing upright, to about 50 cm in height, but Edwards has re-interpreted it as having prostrate habit, with shorter aerial axes of about 15 cm height. The axes branched dichotomously, the aerial axes branching at a comparatively wide angle of up to 90°, and were terminated with elliptical, thick-walled sporangia, which when mature, opened by spiral slits, so that the sporangia appear to be spiral in form. Sporangia contained many identical spores (isospores) bearing trilete marks. The spores may therefore be interpreted as meiospores, the product of meiotic divisions, and thus the plants described by Edwards and by Kidston and Lang were diploid, sporophytes. The plant was originally interpreted as a tracheophyte, because the stem has a simple central vascular cylinder or protostele, but more recent interpretations in the light of additional data indicated that Rhynia major had water-conducting tissue lacking the secondary thickening bars seen in the xylem of Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii, more like the water-conducting system (hydrome) of moss sporophytes. Edwards reinterpreted the species as non-vascular plant and renamed it Aglaophyton major. Aglaophyton is among the first plants known to have had a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which formed arbuscules in a well-defined zone in the cortex of its stems. Aglaophyton lacked roots, and like other rootless land plants of the Silurian and early Devonian may have relied on mycorrhizal fungi for acquisition of water and nutrients from the soil. The male gametophyte of the species has been formally described,Remy, W & Remy, R (1980) Lyonophyton rhyniensis n.gen. et nov. spec., ein Gametophyt aus dem Chert von Rhynie (Unterdevon, Schottland). Argumenta Palaeobotanica, 6, 37-72 which was assigned to a new form taxon Lyonophyton rhyniensis, but is now properly referred to as an Aglaophyton gametophyte. The Rhynie chert bears many examples of male and female gametophytes, which are loosely similar in their construction to the sporophyte phase, down to bearing rhizoids. Taxonomy Aglaophyton major was first described as Rhynia major by Kidston and Lang in 1920. In 1986 D.S. Edwards re-examined fossil specimens and reported that they did not contain true vascular tissue, but rather conducting tissue more similar to that of bryophytes. As the diagnosis of Rhynia was that it was a vascular plant, he created a new genus, Aglaophyton, for this species. (The other species of Rhynia, R. gwynne-vaughanii, was not affected.) As Rhynia major the species had been placed in the rhyniophytes, but no alternative higher level classification was proposed for the new genus. =Phylogeny= In 2004, Crane et al. published a cladogram for the polysporangiophytes which places Aglaophyton as a sister of the vascular plants (tracheophytes), with the Horneophytopsida being sister to both. The basis of the cladogram is that Aglaophyton has more developed conducting tissue than the Horneophytopsida, but does not have true vascular tissue.

Grass surfers take the trucks off an old skateboard and find a mildly steep hill made up of dry grass, sand, moss, dirt or other surface that could be used to gain speed and control. Risks Because this is done downhill on dry grass, dirt, etc. there is a significant lack of control. A potential risk is of hitting a buried rock. This could cause the board to come to a sudden deceleration, causing the surfer to fall off the board, possibly resulting in injury. Parts Most boards are just skateboard decks that are modified by taking the trucks and hardware off and in some cases covering the bottom in duct tape or polyurethane. In other cases, actual surf boards have been used with varying results on steeper smooth surfaces such as sand. The pointed uncurved tip of these boards usually results in a leaping stop when the tip embeds itself at the base of the incline, and progression down the incline requires frequent shimmying. Methods The most popular method in grass surfing is to find an old skateboard deck and remove the trucks and other hardware. Next find a mildly steep hill of dry grass, gravel, dirt, sand, etc. While standing on the skateboard deck in a crouched position at the top of the hill, push yourself and gain speed, gradually assuming a more natural standing position. Modifications Some people cover the bottom of the boards in a sealant (usually polyurethane), while some may add furniture wax to the bottom of the board (such as the brand Pledge, or something similar).

The agency uses its $7 billion annual budget (FY 2007) to expand access to quality health care for all Americans through an array of grants to state and local governments, community-based health care providers, and health professions training programs. These HRSA-supported grantees provide direct health care services to 20 million people each year. Duke led HRSA's implementation of President Bush's Health Center Initiative, which has created or expanded 1,100 service delivery sites since 2001 and boosted the number of patients served annually at health centers from about 10 million in 2001 to 15 million in 2006. HRSA-supported health centers deliver high-quality preventive and primary care to patients regardless of their ability to pay at 4,000 sites across the United States. HRSA recently implemented another Presidential initiative meant to extend health center services to an estimated 300,000 residents in some of America's poorest counties. Eighty grants worth more than $40 million were awarded in August 2007 to bring the benefits of health centers to low-income counties that do not currently have access to health center care. Duke also led federal efforts to boost organ donation. Since 2003, the HRSA-sponsored Organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative has brought together donation professionals and hospital leaders to share ways to raise donation rates in their facilities to 75 percent of eligible organ donors. Since then, the number of hospitals achieving the 75 percent goal has increased from 55 to 301, and a record 29,000 transplant operations took place in 2006, up from 19,000 in 1995. At HRSA, Duke also administered: *the $2.1 billion Ryan White program, which give more than 500,000 low-income people living with HIV/AIDS the medication and care they need to get better or stay well; *maternal and child health block grants that states use to fight infant illness and mortality by supporting health care for pregnant women and their babies; *a range of programs that train health care workers and place them in areas where they are in short supply; and *cost-saving networks of care among rural health care providers. Inside HRSA, Duke worked hard to make the agency more cohesive. She created a single agency-wide process for handling grant applications and awards and she streamlined the way HRSA communicates with the public and Congress. Additionally, Duke created the HRSA Scholars Program in 2001 to attract talented new employees to support the agency's mission of expanding access to quality health care for all Americans. Its cornerstone is a year-long training and development curriculum that rotates scholars among four program and administrative areas. Duke created the program after viewing staffing forecasts showing that many of HRSA's most experienced employees soon would be eligible for retirement. Another Scholar class entered HRSA in September 2007; the 250 graduates of the Scholar program now on staff at the agency represent more than a tenth of the agency's total workforce.  Professional background  Before coming to HRSA, Duke served as deputy assistant secretary for administration in another HHS operating division, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) . In that post, she was in charge of grants policy, financial management, internal and state systems, human resources and administrative functions. Duke also has more than 12 years of experience as both acting assistant secretary and principal deputy in HHS' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget (OASMB) – currently called the Office of Resources and Technology, which includes HHS' chief financial officer, management control officer and chief information officer. She oversaw major organizational changes carried out within the framework of the Department's Continuous Improvement Program, reinvention efforts to streamline HHS personnel, and an initiative focusing on regional restructuring. In the mid-1990s, she led the Department in implementing the Congressional mandate to separate the Social Security Administration from HHS –an effort that saw no personnel grievances filed. In 2006, Duke received a Presidential Rank Award of Distinguished Executive, the most prestigious award offered by a U.S. President to Federal senior executives and professionals. She was one of only six 2006 award recipients from the Department of Health and Human Services. Duke entered Federal service at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), where she rose to the rank of deputy assistant director and director of policy and systems in OPM's Office of Training and Development from 1984-86. From 1978-84, she was director of the Government Affairs Institute in OPM's Office of Executive and Management Development. The institute trains Federal executives in such responsibilities as testifying before Congress, developing budgets and managing large bureaucracies. Before joining the government, Duke was a professor of political science and spent two years as a research writer for Congressional Quarterly, a Washington, D.C.-based publication that covers Capitol Hill and Federal agencies.  Education  Duke earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Douglass College of Rutgers University, a master's degree in political science and African studies from Northwestern University, and a doctorate in political science from George Washington University. She stays connected to academia by teaching political science and American government courses at Washington-area universities and by mentoring graduate students.

All quadruple jumps have 4 revolutions, except for the quadruple Axel, which has 4 1/2 revolutions, although no figure skater to date has landed the quadruple Axel in competition. The quadruple toe loop and quadruple Salchow are the two most commonly performed. Quadruple jumps have become increasingly common among World and Olympic level men's single skaters, to the point that not having one in a program has come to be seen as a severe handicap. The first person to land a ratified quadruple jump in competition was Canadian Kurt Browning in 1988. In 2002, Miki Ando became the first woman to do so, and she remains one of only five women to have landed a ratified quadruple jump in international competition. History of first jumps In singles competition for men: *On March 25, 1988, at the World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Kurt Browning, a Canadian, landed the first ratified quadruple jump (a quad toe loop) in competition. *On March 7, 1998, at the Junior Grand Prix Final in Lausanne, Switzerland, Timothy Goebel landed the first ratified quadruple Salchow and, in particular, a quad Salchow in combination. *On September 16, 2011, in the short program at the Colorado Springs Invitational, Brandon Mroz landed the first ratified quad Lutz in a sanctioned competition. On November 12, he landed a ratified quad Lutz at the NHK Trophy, becoming the first skater to land successfully a quad Lutz in international competition. *On April 22, 2016, in the short program at the Team Challenge Cup in Spokane, United States, Shoma Uno landed the first ratified quadruple flip in competition. *On September 30, 2016, in the short program at the Autumn Classic International in Montreal, Canada, Yuzuru Hanyu landed the first ratified quadruple loop (also known as the \\"Rittberger\\" in Europe) in competition. *No quadruple Axel has yet been ratified. *No quadruple combinations (quadruple jumps followed by quadruple loop or toe loop) or sequences (quadruple jumps followed by any quadruple jumps except for quadruple loop or toe loop) have yet been ratified. In singles competition for women: *On December 14, 2002, in the free skate at the Junior Grand Prix Final in The Hague, Netherlands, Miki Ando landed the first ratified quadruple Salchow in competition. *On March 10, 2018, in the long program at the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, Alexandra Trusova landed the first ratified quadruple toe loop in competition. She is also the second woman to land a ratified quadruple Salchow, making her the first woman to complete two quads in one program, and two different types of quads in one program. *On September 7, 2018, in the long program at the Junior Grand Prix in Kaunas, Lithuania, Alexandra Trusova became the first woman to land a quad jump in combination, landing the quad toe loop that was followed by a triple toe loop. *On October 12, 2018, in the long program at the Junior Grand Prix in Yerevan, Armenia, Alexandra Trusova landed the first ratified quadruple Lutz in competition. *On October 19, 2019, in the long program at the Grand Prix in Las Vegas, United States, Anna Shcherbakova became the first lady to land a quadruple Lutz in combination with triple toeloop. *On October 26, 2019, in the long program at the Grand Prix in Kelowna, Canada, Alexandra Trusova became the first lady to complete three quads in one program. *On December 7, 2019, in the long program at the Grand Prix Final in Torino, Italy, Alexandra Trusova landed the first ratified quadruple Flip in competition.

Execution  A jump harness is often employed in training quads. Max Aaron stated that the smallest error may make the difference in the success of a quad attempt: \\"The minute your left arm is behind you, or your three-turn is too fast, if your hips don't turn in time, if your foot isn't in the right place, anything will throw you off.\\" Ross Miner stated that the quality of the ice sometimes plays a role but more on the quad salchow than the toe loop. Practicing quads increases the risk of injury as well as wear and tear on a skater's body.

Johnson then left to form Halfcocked (then known as Half Cocked) with guitarist Tommy O'Neil, bassist/backing vocalist Jhen Kobran and lead vocalist Sarah Reitkopp, later adding guitarist Johnny Rock Heatley who guested on debut album Sell Out (Halfcocked album) and joined as a full member with second album Occupation: Rock Star.

It is a small family-run independent firm. The company is based at the old Crosville bus depot opposite Machynlleth railway station. It was established in 2001. History Plaxton Pointer 2 bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Machynlleth in September 2014 Enviro200 Dart and Optare Solo at the company's depot in September 2014 Lloyds Coaches was formed in 2001 by former Crosville Motor Services and Arriva Buses Wales employee Wyn Lloyd.A life on the buses with Lloyds Coaches of Machynlleth Daily Post 26 June 2013 The company began operations from a site in Machynlleth, and acquired the former Crosville Motor Services garage in 2002. The garage was briefly shared with Arriva Buses Wales before the larger company moved away from the site. A Powys County Council contracted route between Machynlleth and Dinas Mawddwy was awarded to the company, and private hire work was also operated. Six further routes were acquired in May 2004. The company expanded gradually over the following few years. Coaching operations were increased with the purchase of new vehicles and the introduction of rail replacement work, first for Central Trains and later Arriva Trains Wales. Route 34, one of the six routes won in 2004, was improved with the introduction of a clockface timetable between Machynlleth and Aberllefenni, and is now run on a largely commercial basis. In 2009 the company employed and introduced its first general manager who in turn devised and implemented a strategic development plan that would see rapid and aggressive expansion in the area. In June 2010 an hourly route X28 between Machynlleth and Aberystwyth was launched with the intention of competing against Arriva Buses Wales, however the latter company withdrew its similar but shorter route 28 days before the commencement of the X28 service. In December 2010 the company's strategic plan gained pace with the introduction of a new two-hourly service numbered X29, linking Tywyn to Machynlleth and beyond to Aberystwyh through advertised bus connections with bus route X28. The company gained further pace with their expansion process and soon acquired the majority of services in the Dolgellau area as well as the 28 service previously operated by Arriva Buses Wales along the coast between Dolgellau and Tywyn. On 5 September 2011 the X28 and the X29 services were rebranded as the Coastliner services operating under the brand name of the Cambrian Coastliner Coast to Coast network which would market the travel opportunities now in place.Cambrian Coastliner Coast to Coast Lloyds Coaches From April 2012 a new strategic bus network was unveiled by the company as a part of its continued strategic expansion in the area through the introduction of a new X27 service between Dolgellau and Machynlleth which would operate every two hours linking into the X28 Coastliner service and other services at Machynlleth. Service 522 was also renumbered X26 with services 34 and 34A re-timed for better connections at Machynlleth with other strategic services. Overall the new network introduced provided new travel opportunities across all services supported by a new commercial network day ticket introduced by the company including other ticketing incentives such as weekly tickets, and workers weekly tickets. In an opportunity at developing multi modal transport opportunities for the area the company approached Arriva Trains Wales which operated the Cambrian Raliway service. Through a collaborative approach both companies would jointly market the bus and rail services offered between Machynlleth and Aberystwyth as well as an agreement to fully accept each other's day return travel tickets on both bus and rail services. On 24 September 2012 the company began operating on the T2 TrawsCymru service in conjunction with the Welsh Government as a replacement to the X32 service previously operated by Arriva Buses Wales. Their partner operator in this was Express Motors of Pen-y-groes and Blaenau Ffestiniog. The company's general manager left the company in 2014 to pursue other career opportunities, leaving behind a legacy of high standards, improved bus services and integrated transport opportunities. The company's general manager and company itself were both recognised for their achievements at Wales and UK level bus industry awards for innovation, and high standards of services provided through their dedication and hard work to their passengers by working closely with key stakeholders. In 2016, after the closure of GHA Coaches, Lloyds Coaches also began operating the T3 TrawsCymru service to Wrexham. When Express Motors failed, at the beginning of 2018, Lloyds continued to run T2 between Bangor and Aberystwyth, and diverted the route slightly to take in previous parts of a route served by the Express Service 1 which had been discontinued (notably through Garndolbenmaen and Dolydd. Lloyds also increased the frequency to strengthen the Porthmadog–Caernarfon service on which they had become the only operator (apart from a few night-time contract services by Arriva).Gwynedd Council website: bus timetables See also *List of bus operators of the United Kingdom ReferencesExternal links * Company website Category:Bus operators in Wales Category:Companies based in Powys ","title":"Lloyds Coaches"},{"id":"15029397","text":"Gmina Głuchołazy is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in Nysa County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland, on the Czech border.

The Drosophila homolog is SAK, the C elegans homolog is zyg-1, and the Xenopus homolog is Plx4.  Function  PLK4 encodes a member of the polo family of serine/threonine protein kinases. The protein localizes to centrioles—complex microtubule-based structures found in centrosomes—and regulates centriole duplication during the cell cycle. Overexpression of PLK4 results in centrosome amplification, and knockdown of PLK4 results in loss of centrosomes.  Structure  PLK4 contains an N-terminal kinase domain (residues 12-284) and a C-terminal localization domain (residues 596-898). Other polo-like kinase members contain 2 C-terminal polo box domains (PBD). PLK4 contains these 2 domains in addition to a third PBD, which facilitates oligomerization, targeting, and promotes trans-autophosphorylation, limiting centriole duplication to once per cell cycle.  As a cancer drug target  Inhibitors of the enzymatic activity PLK4 have potential in the treatment of cancer. The PLK4 inhibitor R1530 down regulates the expression of mitotic checkpoint kinase BubR1 that in turn leads to polyploidy rendering cancer cells unstable and more sensitive to cancer chemotherapy. Furthermore, normal cells are resistant to the polyploidy inducing effects of R1530. Another PLK4 inhibitor, CFI-400945 has demonstrated efficacy in animal models of breast and ovarian cancer. Another PLK4 inhibitor, centrinone, has been reported to deplete centrioles in human and other vertebrate cell types, which resulted in a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1. Inhibition of PLK4 using a chemical genetic strategy has validated this p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1. PLK4 was also identified as a potential therapeutic target for malignant rhabdoid tumors, medulloblastomas and possibly, other embryonal tumors of the brain.  Interactions and substrates  Documented PLK4 substrates include STIL, GCP6, Hand1, Ect2, FBXW5, and itself (via autophosphorylation). Autophosphorylation of PLK4 results in ubiquitination and subsequent destruction by the proteasome. PLK4 has been shown to interact with Stratifin.

It has also been used to refer to the constant switching and ousting of political leaders from offices such as the Prime Minister of Australia and Japan. In some cases, the roles are performed in sequence, but in certain circumstances they may be performed at the same time. Political analysts claim that an unhealthy relationship can develop between the private sector and government, based on the granting of reciprocated privileges to the detriment of the nation, and can lead to regulatory capture. Overview The metaphor of a revolving door has been used to describe people switching jobs, from working as lawmakers, to being lobbyists, and vice versa. Governments hire industry professionals for their private sector experience, their influence within corporations that the government is attempting to regulate or do business with, and in order to gain political support (donations and endorsements) from private firms. Industry, in turn, hires people out of government positions to gain personal access to government officials, seek favorable legislation/regulation and government contracts in exchange for high-paying employment offers, and get inside information on what is going on in government. The lobbying industry is especially affected by the revolving door concept, as the main asset for a lobbyist is contacts with and influence on government officials. This industrial climate is attractive for ex-government officials. It can also mean substantial monetary rewards for the lobbying firms and government projects and contracts in the hundreds of millions for those they represent.Timothy J.

The practice was increasingly viewed as corrupt and a drag on unfastening the ties between private sector and state which prevent economic and political reforms. In April 2007, a law to phase out amakudari prohibits ministries from attempting to place bureaucrats in industry with implementation in 2009. However, the law also removed a two-year ban that prevented retiring officials from taking jobs with companies with which they had official dealings during the five years before retirement. Definition The term's literal meaning, \\"descent from heaven,\\" refers to the descent of the Shinto gods from heaven to earth; the modern usage employs it as a metaphor, where \\"heaven\\" refers to the upper echelons of the civil service, the civil servants are the deities, and the earth is the private-sector corporations In amakudari, senior civil servants retire to join organizations linked with or under the jurisdiction of their ministries or agencies when they reach mandatory retirement age, usually between 50 and 60 in the public service. The former officials may collude with their former colleagues to help their new employers secure government contracts, avoid regulatory inspections and generally secure preferential treatment from the bureaucracy.Jiji Press, \\"'Amakudari' landed 646 as pension fund execs\\", Japan Times, 7 March 2012, p. 1. Amakudari may also be a reward for preferential treatment provided by officials to their new employers during their term in the civil service. Some government organisations are said to be expressly maintained for the purpose of hiring retiring bureaucrats and paying them high salaries at taxpayers' expense.Amakudari crackdown called toothless, poll ploy, Japan Times, 14 April 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007 In the strictest meaning of amakudari, bureaucrats retire into private companies. In other forms bureaucrats move into government corporations (yokosuberi or 'sideslip'), are granted successive public and private sector appointments (wataridori or 'migratory bird') or may become politicians, including becoming members of parliament (seikai tenshin).Richard A. Colignon and Chikako Usui (2003) Amakudari: The Hidden Fabric of Japan's Economy, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, . Political scientists have identified amakudari as a central feature of Japan's political and economic structure. The practice is thought to bind private and public sector in a tight embrace and prevent political and economic change.The Enigma of Japanese Power, Karel van Wolferen, 1989, History Amakudari is widespread in many branches of the Japanese government but is currently subject to government efforts to regulate the practice. Pressure to reduce amakudari retirement to corporations may be leading to an increase in bureaucrats retiring to other public sector organisations instead. Amakudari was a minor issue before World War II since government officials could be outplaced to a large number of industrial organization that were nationalized. However, reforms during the Occupation of Japan eliminated most of these nationalized organizations resulting in a need to outplace individuals to the private sector. Such outplacement is inevitable in a personnel system where traditional Confucian values prevent one who entered the organization at the same time as another to become his subordinate A 1990 study suggested that amakudari retirements to large companies by bureaucrats from prominent ministries, such as the Ministry of Finance, had peaked in 1985 but that the practice was on the increase by bureaucrats from other types of government organisations such as the National Tax Agency. As a result, the percentage of former bureaucrats on the boards of private-sector listed companies had remained stable at 2%. A series of scandals in the mid-1990s focused the media spotlight on amakudari. In the 1994 general contracting (zenekon) scandal, corruption was uncovered among bureaucrats associated with building contractors, leading to the jailing of high-ranking politician Shin Kanemaru for tax evasion. In the mortgage scandal of 1996, Japanese housing lenders went on a lending spree and racked up bad debts worth 6 trillion yen ($65.7 billion) sparking a financial crisis. The industry was supposed to be regulated by the Ministry of Finance, but the presence of its former officials in top jobs at the lenders is thought to have deflected oversight.Mayumi Otsuma, Ken Ellis, Todd Zaun, Andrew Morse, and Norie Kuboyama \\"Japan's Housing Lenders' Crisis\\", Japan Policy Research Institute, JPRI Critique Vol. III No. 2: February 1996. Accessed 7 April 2007. It wasn't until the next decade that Japanese prime ministers responded with policies to limit amakudari, although it is unclear whether these policies are having any effect. In July 2002, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi ordered that strict amakudari be ended, because of its association with corruption between business and politics.\\"Japanese Government to Review 'Amakudari' Practice\\", People's Daily, July 23, 2002. Accessed 7 April 2007. Koizumi's successor, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe enacted new rules as part of a policy pledge to completely eradicate amakudari in 2007, but his reforms were criticised as toothless (see below) and a campaign ploy for Upper House elections in July 2007.Editorial:Constitutional revision, Asahi Shimbun, 26 July 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007 While policy has focused on limiting amakudari to private companies, the number of bureaucrats retiring to jobs at other government organisations (yokosuberi or \\"sideslip\\") has surged reaching 27,882 appointments in 2006 up 5,789 on the previous year. These organisations, numbering 4,576, received 98 percent of the expenses for state projects without being subject to the bidding processes faced by private companies.l5,789 more 'amakudari' positions filled, Asahi Shimbun, 31 March 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007 Over 50 years ending in 2010, 68 high-level government bureaucrats have taken jobs with electricity suppliers after retirement from their government positions. In 2011, 13 retired government bureaucrats were employed in senior positions in Japanese electric utilities.Kyodo News, \\"Utilities got 68 ex-bureaucrats via 'amakudari'\\", Japan Times, 4 May 2011, p. 2. Legal status Amakudari is subject to rules which were revised in April 2007 in response to corruption scandals. Under the new rules, ministries are instructed to slowly stop helping bureaucrats land new jobs over three years starting in 2009. Instead, a job center to be set up by the end of 2008 would take on the role, and government agencies and ministries will be prohibited from brokering new jobs for retirees. However, the law removed a two-year ban that prevented retiring officials from taking jobs with companies with which they had official dealings during the five years before retirement, which may increase amakudari. It also left considerable loopholes, including not placing restrictions on watari in which retired bureaucrats move from one organization to another. Bureaucrats could retire to a job at another government agency, and then switch jobs to a private company later.Editorial: Civil service reform, Asahi Shimbun, 24 July 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007 Critics say that the government could better prevent Amakudari by raising the retirement age for bureaucrats above 50. In October 2006, 339 public entities were violating the guidelines concerning amakudari, a figure 38 times higher than the number for the previous year.339 entities violate 'amakudari' rules, Asahi Shimbun, 17 July 2007, retrieved 26 July 2007 This declined to 166 by July 2007. Impact As well as scandals, the effects of amakudari have been documented by a sizable body of research. Some studies find that amakudari promotes more risky business activities. A 2001 study found that banks with amakudari employees were found to behave less prudently the more retired civil servants they employed (measured by the capital-asset ratio, an indicator of the prudential behaviour of banks).Effect of Amakudari on Bank Performance in the Post-Bubble Period, Kenji Suzuki, Scandinavian Working Papers in Economics, No 136, 1 November 2001, retrieved 27 July 2007 Many studies find that companies with amakudari employees are subjected to less oversight by public agencies. Around 70 percent of public contracts awarded to organisations that employed hired retired bureaucrats through amakudari were given without a bidding process in 2005. The contracts were worth a total 233 billion yen. By contrast 18 percent of private companies that didn't have ex-bureaucrats on the payroll got contracts without bidding.Firms with amakudari ties win government projects with no bids, Asahi Shimbun, 25 June 2007, retrieved 27 July 2007 =New Zealand= There is no major legislation against revolving door practices in New Zealand, but some ad hoc provisions exist in relation to certain industries. For example, a scandal in which MP Taito Phillip Field was jailed for corruption in relation to improper use of his government position to benefit from helping people with immigration applications was influential in the creation of a restraint of trade clause in the Immigration Advisers Licensing Act 2007. The Act prohibits Ministers of Immigration, Associate Ministers of Immigration and immigration officials from becoming a licensed immigration adviser for one year after leaving government employment. =United Kingdom= The movement of senior civil servants and government ministers into business roles is overseen by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOBA), but it is not a statutory body and has only advisory powers. The Channel Four Dispatches programme 'Cabs for Hire', broadcast in early 2010, which showed several sitting members of Parliament and former ministers offering their influence and contacts in an effort to get lobbying jobs, has generated renewed concern about this issue. A Transparency International UK report on the subject, published in May 2011, called for ACOBA to be replaced by a statutory body with greater powers to regulate the post-public employment of former ministers and crown servants.'Cabs for Hire?

This gene is found on chromosome 22 in humans. The encoded protein plays a key role in phospholipid biosynthesis. Choline kinase (CK) and ethanolamine kinase (EK) catalyzes the first step in phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis. Read- through transcripts are expressed from this locus that include exons from the downstream CPT1B locus. Structure The CHKB gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 22 at position 13.3 and it spans 4,041 base pairs. The CHKB gene produces a 7 kDa protein composed of 60 amino acids. The structure of the protein has been found to be a homodimer, and forms a heterodimer with the CHKA protein. It has also been found to contain multiple highly conserved domains, such as a Brenner phosphotransferase consensus sequence essential in catalytic function. Function The CHKB gene encodes for a key protein in phospholipid biosynthesis. The choline kinase (CK) and ethanolamine kinase (EK) proteins, which are coded by the CHKB gene, catalyze the phosphorylation of choline/ethanolamine in vitro to phosphocholine/phosphoethanolamine. The catalysis is controlled by ATP in the presence of magnesium and ADP, and commits choline to the enzymatic pathway for biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine. This is the first step in the biosynthesis of phosphocholine/phosphoethanolamine in all animal cells, and is done by the Kennedy pathway. The highly purified choline kinases from mammalian sources and their recombinant gene products have been shown to have ethanolamine kinase activity as well, indicating that both activities reside on the same protein. However, it has been shown that the protein has higher activity with ethanolamine and may not significantly contribute to in vivo phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The choline kinase-like protein encoded by CHKB belongs to the choline/ethanolamine kinase family; however, its exact function is not known. At least two transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene, and one of the transcripts is bicistronic. Clinical significance Mutations in CHKB have been found to result in mitochondrial deficiencies and associated disorders. Knockdown of the gene has been known to result in decreased choline kinase and phosphatidylcholine activity. This impairment in activity may lead to a modified composition of the phospholipid composition in the mitochondrial membrane resulting in major disorders in the function and structure of the mitochondria. Major disorders include as Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDCMC), and Narcolepsy. =Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDCMC)= CHKB mutations have been majorly associated with Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDCMC). Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDCMC) is an autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy characterized by muscle biopsy results displaying an enlarged mitochondria which are common in the periphery of the fibers but scarce around the center. Common clinical manifestations of MDCMC include: *early-onset hypotonia *muscle wasting *mildly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels *severe intellectual disability without brain structural abnormalities *Gower's sign *mental retardation *fatal cardiomyopathy Symptoms such as neurogenic atrophy, enlarged mitochondria in the periphery of the fibers, and complex I deficiency were shown in a Spanish patient with a homozygous mutation of c.810T>A. Another patient with a homozygous mutation (p.E292X) in the CHKB gene exhibited rhythmic jerkings of arms, which were characterized as muscle spasms. Finally, a patient with a homozygous c.810T>A showed signs of Gower's sign, hypotonia, and proximal muscle weakness. =Narcolepsy= Narcolepsy is a neurological disabling sleep disorder, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, symptoms of abnormal rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Cataplexy is a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions, which is the most valuable clinical feature used to diagnose narcolepsy.

Plot summary Twelve-year-old Joshua Cope is contacted by a corporation called Gippart International one day late at night. Joshua and his friend, Bhasvar (Baz) Patel go to Gippart and meet Max Herbert, a talent scout. Josh is sent into a dreamworld to sell products. But dreams also come with nightmares... Umaya, the collective dream of everyone at that point in time, is caught between dreams and reality. Josh, Baz and a fellow associate Teresa cannot get out of the dream-world, where time is running backwards due to a Gippart employee attempting to break into real time rather than dream-time. Along his adventure, Josh meets his dead twin sister Jericho, who has been attempting to get in contact with him for 350 years. But with Jericho comes Lucide, a guardian who makes sure that no one crosses the borders of life and death. The members of this troop find themselves with powers that they cannot explain. Baz, the first to find his powers, can control dream time by listening to the rhythm and matching it, causing it to slow, stop, or even rewind. Teresa changes Umaya with words, influencing people and surroundings to her will, she is the group storyteller. Josh is a thief and can change the very nature of things just by looking at them. However, they are trapped in umaya, the dream- world. The four children must find Tembe at the end of time and fulfill Siparti's last promise to Temberi. They learn about each of Siparti's six kids and put together the clues that each of them hold. After a harrowing ordeal, Josh, Jericho, Baz, Teresa, and Mervin Spratt manage to find their way to the edge of time itself, where the Tembe people live in a crumbling Fortress. The Tembe, descended from Temberi, have been trapped at the edge of time for over 1000 years. Luckily, the Tembe are friendly people, and show the associates how their Fortress is slowly being ripped away into the hurricane whom they have named Satura.

Biggs lives and works in New York City. Biggs' work focuses on individuals in extreme landscapes or situations and often navigates territory between art and science. She has captured such events as kayaks performing a synchronized ballet in Arctic waters and sulfur miners inside an active volcano. Recent projects have explored the creation and loss of memory from personal, physical, and scientific perspectives. Biggs’ work has taken her into areas of conflict in the Horn of Africa and to Mars (as a member of crew 181 at the Mars Desert Research Station). She has collaborated with neuroscientists, Arctic explorers, aerospace engineers, astrophysicists, miners, Yemeni refugees, and a robot. Her earlier video work dealt with issues of psychosis and psychotropic drugs. Biggs was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts in 2018. Recent work In addition to videos, her recent work includes multi-discipline performances, often including multiple large-scale videos, live musicians, artificial intelligence, paraplegics and athletes. Her newest work incorporates footage shot by Biggs at refugee camps in Djibouti, in Ethiopian badlands, and at Mars simulations in Utah and the Himalayas. She has recently trained in space medicine, equestrian vaulting and arctic kayaking. On 30 July 2020, Biggs created an experimental live online performance at Fridman Gallery in New York City. While Biggs directed, remotely, singer and dancer Mary Esther Carter performed, accompanied by an Artificial intelligence entity named A.I. Anne, which was created by composer and music technologist Richard Savery. Also in July 2020, the Boca Raton Museum of Art presented a new installation by Biggs, \\"Solitary Acts.\\" In June 2019, Biggs presented ''Overview Effect, an exhibition of new video work, at the Cristin Tierney Gallery in New York City. As part of this exhibition, Biggs' premiered \\"\\"How the Light Gets In,\\" a multi-media performance, at the Theater at the New Museum. In December, 2018, Biggs had solo exhibitions and film screenings at the Museo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre and the Museum of Science and the Cosmos in the Canary Islands. In May 2018, Biggs was included in \\"Shots Across the Plane,\\" at the at Zurab Tsereteli Museum of Modern Art in Tbilisi, Georgia. In 2017, the Neuberger Museum of Art (Purchase, New York) presented \\"A Step on the Sun.\\" In addition, Biggs' work has recently been presented in shows at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (June, 2018) , the 17º Festival Internacional de la Imagen (group exhibition as part of art + tech festival) in Manizales Colombia, \\"Art & Coal\\" (Kunst & Kohle), a group exhibition spanning 17 museums in the Ruhr Valley), at the Skulpturenmuseum Glaskasten Marl in Marl, Germany, \\"For a gentle song would not shake us if we had never heard a loud one\\" at the Fotografisk Center, Copenhagen, Denmark. and \\"Videos for a Stadium\\" at the University of Kentucky Art Museum (screening at the Commonwealth Stadium at University of Kentucky) Lexington, KY. Biggs was selected to be on Crew 181 of the Mars Desert Research Station, and has incorporated elements of space exploration in her latest work. Exhibitions and screenings Biggs has recently been presented in solo shows and screenings at Cristin Tierney Gallery in New York City, Connersmith Gallery in Washington, DC, Barbara Polla's Analix Forever Gallery in Geneva, Smack Mellon in Brooklyn NY, and Galerie Anita Beckers in Frankfurt Germany. In June 2017, at David Lynch's Club Silencio in Paris, Biggs presented a premier of her performance piece, \\"Far From Home,\\" which incorporated a live musical performance by Rhys Chatham and a reading by Frank Smith with video of her recent work in a Yemeni refugee camp in Djibouti and at the Mars Desert Research Station. In 2015, the Blaffer Art Museum in Houston, Texas, presented Biggs' Echo of the Unknown, a multidimensional exhibition combining video, sound, and objects that explore the role of memory in the construction of identity. Drawing from her personal memories of the effects of Alzheimer’s on family members, heroic stories of public figures coping with the disease, and research conducted with neurologists and geoscientists, Biggs raises fundamental questions about how we become–and how we lose our sense of–who we are. In conjunction with Echo of the Unknown, Blaffer collaborated with more than a dozen UH colleges and Houston institutions on the Blaffer Art Museum Innovation Series, an ambitious slate of lectures, gallery talks and panel discussions, enhancing the exhibition’s role as a catalyst for cross- disciplinary learning. In 2014 Biggs was exhibited in the First International Biennial of Contemporary Art of Cartegena de Indias. The Tampa Museum of Art presented a survey of Biggs' work in 2011. Biggs' video work has also been shown in solo exhibitions at Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal, Glaskasten Marl Sculpture Museum (Marl, Germany), the Mint Museum (Charlotte NC), the Gibbes Museum of Art (Charlotte, NC), the McNay Museum (San Antonio, Texas), the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art (Ithaca, NY), Videonale 13 (Bonn, Germany) and the Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts. In 2012, Biggs' Arctic Trilogy was screened as part of the Environmental Film Festival at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Washington, DC), Biggs travelled to the far Arctic in 2009-2010, where she captured images of individuals' interaction with extremes environments above and below the ice.

Acyl-CoA thioesterases, such as ACOT2, are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze Coenzyme A (CoA) esters, such as acyl-CoAs, bile CoAs, and CoA esters of prostaglandins, to the corresponding free acid and CoA. ACOT2 shows high acyl-CoA thioesterase activity on medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs, with an optimal pH of 8.5. It is most active on myristoyl-CoA but also shows high activity on palmitoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, and arachidoyl-CoA. Function The protein encoded by the ACOT2 gene is part of a family of Acyl-CoA thioesterases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of various Coenzyme A esters of various molecules to the free acid plus CoA. These enzymes have also been referred to in the literature as acyl-CoA hydrolases, acyl-CoA thioester hydrolases, and palmitoyl-CoA hydrolases. The reaction carried out by these enzymes is as follows: CoA ester + H2O → free acid + coenzyme A These enzymes use the same substrates as long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, but have a unique purpose in that they generate the free acid and CoA, as opposed to long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, which ligate fatty acids to CoA, to produce the CoA ester. The role of the ACOT- family of enzymes is not well understood; however, it has been suggested that they play a crucial role in regulating the intracellular levels of CoA esters, Coenzyme A, and free fatty acids. Recent studies have shown that Acyl-CoA esters have many more functions than simply an energy source. These functions include allosteric regulation of enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase, hexokinase IV, and the citrate condensing enzyme. Long-chain acyl-CoAs also regulate opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and activation of Calcium ATPases, thereby regulating insulin secretion. A number of other cellular events are also mediated via acyl-CoAs, for example signal transduction through protein kinase C, inhibition of retinoic acid-induced apoptosis, and involvement in budding and fusion of the endomembrane system. Acyl-CoAs also mediate protein targeting to various membranes and regulation of G Protein α subunits, because they are substrates for protein acylation. In the mitochondria, acyl-CoA esters are involved in the acylation of mitochondrial NAD+ dependent dehydrogenases; because these enzymes are responsible for amino acid catabolism, this acylation renders the whole process inactive. This mechanism may provide metabolic crosstalk and act to regulate the NADH/NAD+ ratio in order to maintain optimal mitochondrial beta oxidation of fatty acids. The role of CoA esters in lipid metabolism and numerous other intracellular processes are well defined, and thus it is hypothesized that ACOT- enzymes play a role in modulating the processes these metabolites are involved in.

Nader was not formally nominated by the national party or the Green Party USA organization, which was, at the time, the largest national Green group; instead he was nominated independently by various state Green parties. In some states, he appeared on the ballot as an independent. Background Although Nader was not formally nominated by the national Green Party, a significant number of the party's members and supporters backed his presidential bid. Several of them actively campaigned for him. Nader qualified for ballot status in 22 states, garnering 685,297 votes or 0.71% of the popular vote (fourth place overall), although the effort did make significant organizational gains for the party. He refused to raise or spend more than $5,000 on his campaign, presumably to avoid meeting the threshold for Federal Elections Commission reporting requirements; the unofficial Draft Nader committee could (and did) spend more than that, but the committee was legally prevented from coordinating in any way with Nader himself. Criticism Nader received some criticism from gay rights supporters for calling gay rights \\"gonad politics\\" and stating that he was not interested in dealing with such matters. However, more recently, Nader has come out in support of same-sex marriage. Running mates Instead of Nader having one running mate on all ballots on which he appeared, the women's caucus of the Green Party decided that a slate of women would run who would act as a cabinet of advisers for his campaign.Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens By Greta Gaard, page 241.

However most political election websites dispute this and have LaDuke as his running mate in most of the states he ran in. Ballot access Denied a place on the ballot in all 50 states, Nader ultimately attained ballot status in 22 states. Events A long term Green catch-phrase came out of the 1996 nominating convention. During Nader's acceptance speech the crowd started to chant \\"Go Ralph Go!\\" to which Nader, appearing uncomfortable, gestured for silence and said \\"the intonation should be 'Go we Go'.\\" The crowd obliged and the phrase \\"gowego\\" became a part of Green history.Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens By Greta Gaard, page 241 References Category:1996 United States presidential campaigns Presidential campaign, 1996 Nader, Ralph Category:1996 United States presidential election ","title":"Ralph Nader 1996 presidential campaign"},{"id":"15029727","text":"Multiplay (UK) Ltd is a UK-based company which was incorporated in May 1997. Originally founded as a gaming events company, known for the Insomnia Gaming festival, now specialises in dedicated game servers, working directly with game studios and publishers. The company is owned by Unity Technologies. History Multiplay started as a LAN event organiser in 1999 hosting their first event \\"Insomnia\\" in conjunction with Wireplay. The event underwent a name change to i-series for their second event \\"i2\\" due to splitting with Wireplay. Events 2-4 were all hosted in Swindon Town before moving to a new venue, the Newbury Racecourse Conference Center for \\"i5\\" in the year 2000. The event later moved to Stoneleigh Park in 2008 for \\"i34\\" citing continued growth needing a larger venue. As a result of the recession of 2008 Multiplay were then forced to move back to Newbury Racecourse citing decreased revenue from sponsorships. After 3 years at Newbury the event outgrew the venue again and moved to Telford International Centre in 2011, and it was here that the name of the event was changed back to the original \\"Insomnia\\" name. On 2 December 2013 Multiplay announced the Insomnia event would move to the Ricoh Arena for i51 onwards citing continued growth. The event moved again for i56 onwards, this time to the Birmingham NEC, the UK's largest exhibition centre. Multiplay was sold to GAME in 2015. It was further sold to Unity Technologies in 2017. Events=Insomnia Gaming Festival= Insomnia Gaming Festival is a large- scale gaming event with a professional Main Stage, an Expo Hall and a large- scale LAN (Local Area Network) event which is the largest LAN in the UK. Originally this was a PC gaming only event, but in recent years has incorporated console gamers. The series of events, referred to as the ‘iSeries’ are sequentially numbered and run three times a year, typically with one around Easter, with the others usually hosted in August and November. The original events were hosted at Newbury Racecourse in the United Kingdom from i5 to i33 when the venue was relocated to Stoneleigh Park for i34. From i38 to i42 the event returned to Newbury. The home of i43 to i50 events was The Telford International Centre and from i51 to i55 it took place at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. i56 - present day is being held at the NEC in Birmingham due to its growth and popularity. These events have evolved with professional competitive tournaments and large exhibition halls. Popular segments of the festival include main stage shows by special guests, often YouTube personalities, as well as evening entertainment such as the \\"World Famous Insomnia Pub Quiz\\". Sometimes referred to as \\"The Glastonbury of Gaming\\", Insomnia continues to be the biggest festival of its kind in the UK. The first Insomnia: Insomnia99 was a 300-player event. At that point, it was, and remains, the largest LAN party held in the United Kingdom. It was announced during i55 that the festival would relocate to the NEC in Birmingham in time for i56 in December 2015. =Minecon 2012= Multiplay were approached by Sandbox/Survival game creators Mojang to produce their fan festival Minecon, celebrating the online world of Minecraft. The convention was held in Disneyland Paris in November 2012 and attracted over 7,000 visitors. =World Cyber Games= Multiplay UK have also hosted the United Kingdom's national qualifiers for the World Cyber Games at their I-Series events for a number of years, working on behalf of Samsung Electronics UK for the 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 games. For the 2009 games Multiplay have been confirmed as the strategic partner by global organiser International Cyber Marketing. The 2009 UK National Final was held at M Festival, Multiplay's own video gaming festival in August 2009 at Stoneleigh Park. =IPL 4 UK Qualifiers= Multiplay UK's i44 event in Telford hosted the IGN Pro League 4 UK Qualifiers (IPL 4 UK) resulting in the biggest eSports event the UK has ever hosted. Over 2,500,000 viewers watched the proceedings with TotalBiscuit and Apollo commentating on top Starcraft 2 professional players like White Ra, Stephano and Grubby. $20,000 prize pool was given out to the top 8 players, with the French player Stephano taking gold. =ESET UK Masters= Multiplay also hosted the finals for the ESET UK Masters in 2012/2013 which plays host to the biggest prize pool for a Starcraft 2 tournament sponsored by a UK organization at an esports event (£10,000 per event). This is set to take part for all 3 iSeries events in 2013 making it one of the most ambitious eSports projects hosted within the UK.

Retention of resident soluble proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is achieved in both yeast and animal cells by their continual retrieval from the cis-Golgi, or a pre-Golgi compartment. Sorting of these proteins is dependent on a C-terminal tetrapeptide signal, lys-asp-glu- leu (KDEL) in animal cells and his-asp-glu-leu (HDEL) in S. cerevisiae. This process is mediated by a receptor that recognizes, and binds the tetrapeptide- containing protein, and returns it to the ER. In yeast, the sorting receptor encoded by a single gene, ERD2, is a seven-transmembrane protein. Unlike yeast, several human homologs of the ERD2 gene, constituting the KDEL receptor gene family, have been described. KDELR2 was the second member of the family to be identified, and it encodes a protein which is 83% identical to the KDELR1 gene product.

The 2000 presidential campaign of Ralph Nader, political activist, author, lecturer and attorney, began on February 21, 2000. He cited \\"a crisis of democracy\\" as motivation to run. He ran in the 2000 United States presidential election as the nominee of the Green Party. He was also nominated by the Vermont Progressive Party and the United Citizens Party of South Carolina. The campaign marked Nader's second presidential bid as the Green nominee, and his third overall, having run as a write-in campaign in 1992 and a passive campaign on the Green ballot line in 1996. Nader's vice presidential running mate was Winona LaDuke, an environmental activist and member of the Ojibwe tribe of Minnesota. Nader appeared on the ballot in 43 states and DC, up from 22 in 1996. He won 2,882,955 votes, or 2.74 percent of the popular vote. His campaign did not attain the 5 percent required to qualify the Green Party for federally distributed public funding in the next election. The percentage did, however, enable the Green Party to achieve ballot status in many new states, such as Delaware and Maryland.Levine, Harry G. (May 2004).

Nomination process On July 9, the Vermont Progressive Party nominated Nader, giving him ballot access in the state. On August 12, the United Citizens Party of South Carolina chose Ralph Nader as its presidential nominee, giving him a ballot line in the state.

In four states, Georgia, Indiana, Idaho, and Wyoming, Nader's name did not appear on the state ballot but he was eligible to receive official write-in votes that were counted. In 3 states, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Dakota, Nader neither appeared on the state ballot nor was he eligible to receive write-in votes. Campaign issues Nader campaigned against the pervasiveness of corporate power and spoke on the need for campaign finance reform. His campaign also addressed problems with the two party system, voter fraud, environmental justice, universal healthcare, affordable housing, free education including college, workers' rights and increasing the minimum wage to a living wage. He also focused on the three-strikes rule, exoneration for prisoners for drug related non-violent crimes, legalization of commercial hemp and a shift in tax policies to place the burden more heavily on corporations than on the middle and lower classes. He opposed pollution credits and giveaways of publicly owned assets. Nader and many of his supporters believed that the Democratic Party had drifted too far to the right. Throughout the campaign, Nader noted he had no worries about taking votes from Al Gore. He stated, \\"Isn't that what candidates try to do to one another—take votes?\\"Ralph Nader.Crashing the Party: Taking on the Corporate Government in an Age of Surrender. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2002. Nader insisted that any failure to defeat Bush would be Gore's responsibility: \\"Al Gore thinks we're supposed to be helping him get elected. I've got news for Al Gore: If he can't beat the bumbling Texas governor with that terrible record, he ought to go back to Tennessee.\\"Ave Umhoefer and Dennis Chaptman. \\"Nader: 'Forked-Tongued' Gore Must Fend For Himself.\\" Milwaukee Journal, November 2, 2000. Campaign developments Nader's supporters protest his exclusion from the debates. The campaign staged a series of large political Super Rallies that each drew over 10,000 paying attendees, such as 12,000 in Boston.Boston Globe (Oct. 2, 2000) republished on CommomDreams.org. Nader 'Super Rally' Draws 12,000 To Boston's FleetCenter In October 2000, at the largest Super Rally of his campaign, in New York City's Madison Square Garden, 15,000 people paid $20 each to attend the rally at which Nader said that Al Gore and George W. Bush were \\"Tweedledee and Tweedledum -they look and act the same, so it doesn't matter which you get.\\" He denounced Gore and Bush as \\"the bad and the worse,\\" whose policies primarily reflect the influence of corporate campaign contributions. He further charged that corporate influence has blurred any meaningful distinctions between the Democratic and Republican Parties. The campaign secured prominent union help. The California Nurses Association and the United Electrical Workers endorsed his candidacy and campaigned for him. Because Nader had been denied access to the ballot in some states, the Nader 2000 campaign launched an effort to challenge the inclusion criteria for the presidential debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. _Independent Candidates' Battle Against the Exclusionary Practices of the Commission on Presidential Debates_ by Eric B. Hull The \\"spoiler\\" controversy In the 2000 presidential election in Florida, George W. Bush defeated Al Gore by 537 votes. Nader received 97,421 votes in Florida (and Pat Buchanan and Harry Browne received 17,484 and 16,415 respectively), which led to claims that Nader was responsible for Gore's defeat. Critics rarely mention Buchanan (who should be considered due to the butterfly ballot) or Browne. Nader, both in his book Crashing the Party and on his website, states: \\"In the year 2000, exit polls reported that 25% of my voters would have voted for Bush, 38% would have voted for Gore and the rest would not have voted at all\\" (which would net a 13%, 12,665 votes, advantage for Gore over Bush). Similarly, in New Hampshire, Bush won a plurality by garnering 273,559 votes, 48.07%, to Gore's 266,348 votes, 46.80%. The 22,198 votes for Nader (3.90%) was triple the margin of victory for Bush (the combined 4,372 votes for Buchanan and Browne fall below the margin of difference). If Gore had received all of Nader's NH votes, he would have won with 15,000 to spare, but if Nader's figures of 38% for Gore and 25% for Bush held true, Gore would not have carried NH. When asked about claims of being a spoiler, Nader typically points to the controversial Supreme Court ruling that halted a Florida recount, Gore's loss in his home state of Tennessee, and the \\"quarter million Democrats who voted for Bush in Florida.\\" =Prior to the election= As pre- election polls showed the race to be close, a group of activists who had formerly worked for Nader calling themselves \\"Nader's Raiders for Gore\\" urged their former mentor to end his campaign. They wrote an open letter to Nader dated October 21, 2000, which stated in part, \\"It is now clear that you might well give the White House to Bush. As a result, you would set back significantly the social progress to which you have devoted your entire, astonishing career.\\" Mainstream media noticed the publishing of the petition. When Nader, in a letter to environmentalists, attacked Gore for \\"his role as broker of environmental voters for corporate cash,\\" and \\"the prototype for the bankable, Green corporate politician,\\" and what he called a string of broken promises to the environmental movement, Sierra Club president Carl Pope sent an open letter to Nader, dated October 27, 2000, defending Al Gore's environmental record and calling Nader's strategy \\"irresponsible.\\" He wrote: > You have also broken your word to your followers who signed the petitions > that got you on the ballot in many states. You pledged you would not > campaign as a spoiler and would avoid the swing states. Your recent campaign > rhetoric and campaign schedule make it clear that you have broken this > pledge... Please accept that I, and the overwhelming majority of the > environmental movement in this country, genuinely believe that your strategy > is flawed, dangerous and reckless. Pope also protested Nader's suggestion that a \\"bumbling Texas governor would galvanize the environmental community as never before,\\" and his statement that \\"The Sierra Club doubled its membership under James G. Watt.\\"\\"Nader Sees a Bright Side to Bush Victory.\\" The New York Times, November 1, p. 29. Wrote Pope in a letter to the New York Times dated November 1, 2000: > Our membership did rise, but Mr. Nader ignores the harmful consequences of > the Reagan-Watt tenure. Logging in national forests doubled. Acid rain fell > unchecked. Cities were choked with smog. Oil drilling, mining and grazing > increased on public lands. A Bush administration promises more drilling and > logging, and less oversight of polluters. It would be little solace if our > membership grew while our health suffered and our natural resources were > plundered.Pope, Carl (November 1, 2000) \\"Nader's Green Logic (Letter to the > Editor).\\", The New York Times On October 26, 2000, Eric Alterman wrote for The Nation: \\"Nader has been campaigning aggressively in Florida, Minnesota, Michigan, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. If Gore loses even a few of those states, then Hello, President Bush. And if Bush does win, then Goodbye to so much of what Nader and his followers profess to cherish.\\" In addition, the Republican Leadership Council ran pro-Nader ads in a few states in an effort to split the liberal vote. =After the election= Harry G. Levine, in his essay Ralph Nader as Mad Bomber states that Tarek Milleron, Ralph Nader's nephew and advisor, when asked why Nader would not agree to avoid swing states where his chances of getting votes were less, answered, \\"Because we want to punish the Democrats, we want to hurt them, wound them.\\" Moreover, syndicated columnist Marianne Means said of Nader's 2000 candidacy, > His candidacy was based on the self-serving argument that it would make no > difference whether Gore or George W. Bush were elected. This was insane. > Nobody, for instance, can imagine Gore picking as the nation's chief law > enforcement officer a man of [John] Ashcroft's anti-civil rights, antitrust, > anti-abortion and anti-gay record. Or picking Bush's first choice to head > the Labor Department, Linda Chavez, who opposes the minimum wage and > affirmative action. Jonathan Chait of the American Prospect said this of Nader's 2000 campaign: > So it particularly damning that Nader fails to clear even this low threshold > [Honesty]. His public appearances during the campaign, far from brutally > honest, were larded with dissembling, prevarication and demagoguery, empty > catchphrases and scripted one-liners. Perhaps you think this was an > unavoidable response to the constraints of campaign sound-bite journalism. > But when given more than 300 pages to explain his case in depth, Nader > merely repeats his tired aphorisms. In contrast, an analysis conducted by Harvard Professor B.C. Burden in 2005 showed Nader while did \\"play a pivotal role in determining who would become president following the 2000 election\\", but that: > Contrary to Democrats’ complaints, Nader was not intentionally trying to > throw the election. A spoiler strategy would have caused him to focus > disproportionately on the most competitive states and markets with the hopes > of being a key player in the outcome. There is no evidence that his > appearances responded to closeness. He did, apparently, pursue voter > support, however, in a quest to receive 5% of the popular vote. However, Chait notes that Nader did indeed focus on swing states disproportionately during the waning days of the campaign, and by doing so jeopardized his own chances of achieving the 5% of the vote he was aiming for. > There was the debate within the Nader campaign over where to travel in the > waning days of the campaign. Some Nader advisers urged him to spend his time > in uncontested states such as New York and California. These states – where > liberals and leftists could entertain the thought of voting Nader without > fear of aiding Bush – offered the richest harvest of potential votes. But... > Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own > campaign – insisted on spending the final days of the campaign on a > whirlwind tour of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In > other words, he chose to go where the votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his > own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain > federal funds in 2004. Defenders of Nader, including Dan Perkins, argued that the margin in Florida was small enough that Democrats could blame any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including Workers World Party candidate Monica Moorehead, who received 1,500 votes. Furthermore, in an article published by Salon.com on Tuesday, November 28, 2000, progressive activist Jim Hightower mentioned that in Florida, a state Gore lost by only 537 votes, 24,000 Democrats voted for Nader, while another 308,000 Democrats voted for Bush. According to Hightower, 191,000 self-described Liberals in Florida voted for Bush, while fewer than 34,000 voted for Nader. An analysis and study by Neal Allen and Brian J. Brox titled \\"The Roots of Third Party Voting\\" stated that although Nader did affect the outcome of the election by changing the outcome in Florida: > On the whole, however, our analysis of voters who support third party and > independent presidential candidates suggests that these voters, in keeping > with the history of third party candidacies as vehicles for protest against > the two-party system, would have voted for other independent or third party > candidates, or would not have voted, if Nader had not been an available > alternative to Gore or Bush. Also, a study in 2002 by the Progressive Review found no correlation in pre- election polling numbers for Nader when compared to those for Gore. According to the study, most of the changes in pre-election polling reflect movement between Bush and Gore rather than Gore and Nader, and they conclude from this that Nader was not responsible for Gore's loss. However, the study also targets Bill Clinton as \\"the individual who did the most harm to Gore (aside from himself)\\", statement challenged by analysts and the press.

PTPRT is also known as PTPrho, PTPρ and human accelerated region 9. The human accelerated regions are 49 regions of the human genome that are conserved among vertebrates, but in humans show significant distinction from other vertebrates. This region may, therefore, have played a key role in differentiating humans from apes. supplement Function The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. PTPrho has been proposed to function during development of the nervous system and as a tumor suppressor in cancer. Structure This PTP possesses an extracellular region, a single transmembrane region, and two tandem intracellular catalytic domains, and thus represents a receptor-type PTP (RPTP). The extracellular region contains a meprin-A5 antigen-PTPmu (MAM) domain, one Ig-like domain and four fibronectin type III-like repeats. PTPrho is a member of the type R2B subfamily of RPTPs, which also includes the RPTPs PTPmu (PTPRM), PTPkappa (PTPRK), and PCP-2 (PTPRU). Comparison of R2B cDNA sequences identified that PTPmu is most closely related to PTPrho. PTPrho is alternatively spliced. Alternative splicing of exons 14, 16, and 22a have been described for PTPrho (PTPRT). Two alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene, which encode distinct proteins, have been reported. The first isoform encodes the larger version of the protein. The second variant lacks a region of the extracellular domain between the fourth FNIII domain and the transmembrane domain and in the juxtamembrane domain. Homophilic binding PTPrho protein mediates homophilic cell-cell adhesion, meaning that when it interacts with a like molecule on an adjacent cell it induces the cells to bind or adhere to one another. PTPrho does not bind to other subfamily members to mediate cell- cell aggregation, similar to other type R2B subfamily members. The MAM domain, Ig domain and all four fibronectin III domain of PTPrho are necessary for cell-cell aggregation. PTPrho is the most frequently mutated RPTP in colon, lung, skin and stomach cancers. Many of the mutations observed in cancer occur in the extracellular domain of PTPrho, suggesting that defective cell-cell aggregation may contribute to the tumorigenicity of these mutations. When PTPrho proteins are engineered with the different point mutations observed in cancer and then are expressed in non-adherent Sf9 cells, these cells do not mediate comparable levels of cell-cell aggregation to wild-type PTPrho, demonstrating that the mutations observed in cancer are loss of function mutations. Tyrosine phosphatase activity The first catalytic domain of Type R2B RPTPs is considered the active phosphatase domain, whereas the second phosphatase domain is thought to be inactive. Mutations in the second phosphatase domain of PTPrho, however, result in a reduction of phosphatase activity of PTPrho. Deletion of the second tyrosine phosphatase domain in colorectal cancer cells also reduces PTPrho catalytic activity, again demonstrating that the second phosphatase domain of PTPrho does regulate catalytic activity, either directly or indirectly. Catalytic activity of PTPrho may also be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the wedge domain of the first tyrosine phosphatase domain on tyrosine 912 by Fyn tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Y912 results in increased multimerization of PTPrho, likely in cis, with other PTPrho molecules. Based on crystal structure analysis and modeling, the phosphorylated wedge domain is hypothesized to insert into the catalytic domain of a neighboring PTPrho molecule, thus inactivating it. This mechanism has also been proposed to regulate the catalytic activity of RPTPalpha. The crystal structures of PTPmu and LAR suggest a different mechanism for the regulation of their catalytic activity, as these RPTPs are in an open and active conformation when dimerized. Regulation of gene expression Evaluation of the 5’untranslated regions of PTPrho (PTPRT) cDNA indicate a number of transcription factor binding site consensus sequences, including those for AP-2, c-Myb, NF-1, sox-5, and Sp-1, Oct-1, CdxA, C/EBP, En-1, GATA-1, GATA-2, GKLF, HoxA3, Ik-2, Msx-1, Pax-4 and SRY. (RE1-silencing transcription factor) (REST) is a transcription repressor that binds to REST DNA recognition element (RE-1) in 5’UTRs. A screen of single nucleotide polymorphic genetic changes within the REST binding regions of DNA sequences revealed a polymorphism in the RE-1 of PTPrho (PTPRT). This SNP would result in less REST repressor activity, which could lead to increased expression of PTPrho (PTPRT) in cells that harbored this SNP. Expression and function in cancer PTPrho is the most frequently mutated RPTP in colon, lung, skin and stomach cancers. Evaluation of the cytoplasmic mutations observed in PTPrho in cancer demonstrate that they all reduce catalytic activity, even the mutations located in the second catalytic domain. The frequency of mutations in the cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase domain of PTPrho in cancer has been disputed. The PTPrho (PTPRT) promoter was observed to be hypermethylated in colorectal cancer compared to controls, suggesting another mechanism whereby PTPrho function may be reduced in cancer, in this instance by epigenetic silencing. PTPrho is also upregulated in estrogen receptor alpha positive breast tumor samples versus estrogen receptor alpha negative tumor samples. The authors evaluated 560 selected genes by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) in estrogen receptor alpha positive tissue and compared it to estrogen receptor alpha negative tissue, and found that PTPrho(PTPRT) was upregulated in the estrogen receptor alpha tissue, suggesting a non-tumor suppressor role for PTPrho. Expression and function in the developing nervous system PTPrho (PTPRT) mRNA is expressed in the developing nervous system. Its expression is first observed in stage 25 in Xenopus embryos in the developing optic vesicles and in nascent motor and interneurons of the spinal cord. At stage 35/36, PTPrho (PTPRT) expression is found in the outer nuclear, or photoreceptor, layer, and in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the neural retina. The level of PTPrho (PTPRT) transcript decreases in the photoreceptors and increases in the INL, and by stage 41, is restricted to the INL only. PTPrho (PTPRT) transcripts have also been observed in the developing cortex and olfactory bulbs. PTPrho (PTPRT) is expressed in a very specific subset of neurons in the postnatal cerebellar cortex, the granule cell layer. Specifically, PTPrho (PTPRT) was expressed in postmigratory granule cells of lobules 1 to 6 of the cerebellum. In adults, PTPrho protein is exclusively expressed in the central nervous system and localizes to synapses between neurons. Over-expression of wild-type and catalytically inactive mutant forms of PTPrho result in an increase in the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in cultured neurons in vitro. Knock-down of PTPrho expression decreases the number of synapses in cultured neurons. PTPrho interacts in cis with the extracellular domains of neuroligins and neurexins at synapses. PTPrho is phosphorylated on tyrosine 912 in the wedge region of its first catalytic domain by Fyn tyrosine kinase. Phosphorylation at this site attenuates synapse formation in cultured neurons. When PTPrho is phosphorylated by Fyn, PTPrho appears to form homophilic multimerizations, likely in cis, which appear to decrease PTPrho association with neuroligins and neurexins. The reduction of cis interactions with neuroligins and neurexons is hypothesized to ultimately lead to the reduction in synapse formation. PTPrho activity has also been demonstrated to be required for the development of neuronal dendrites. It was found to regulate dendritic arborization by dephosphorylating tyrosine 177 of Breakpoint cluster region protein (BCR). Substrates PTPrho associates with members of the cadherin and catenin family of cell adhesion molecules as demonstrated by GST-fusion protein pull-down assays using brain homogenate. Using this technique, the authors identified that PTPrho interacts with alpha-actinin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, gamma-catenin/plakoglobin, p120 catenin, desmoglein, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and VE-cadherin. Purified wild-type PTPrho GST fusion protein was able to dephosphorylate E-cadherin and p120catenin co-immunoprecipitated from a pancreatic beta cell line, MIN6-m9. This suggests that these proteins are PTPrho substrates. PTPrho also dephosphorylates BCR protein. The ability of PTPrho to dephosphorylate BCR was shown to have functional consequences for the normal development of neuronal dendritic arborization. PTPrho dephosphorylates STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, on tyrosine 705, a residue that is critical for the activation of STAT3. Dephosphorylation by PTPrho in colorectal cancer cells results in a reduction in the total level of transcription of the STAT3 target genes, Bcl-XL and SOCS3. Likewise, expression of wild-type PTPrho decreases the ability of STAT3 to translocate to the nucleus, where it needs to localize to function as a transcription factor. PTPrho also dephosphorylates paxillin on tyrosine 88. Higher levels of tyrosine 88 phosphorylation of paxillin are observed in colon cancers. When colon cancer cells are engineered to express a mutant form of paxillin that is incapable of being tyrosine phosphorylated, the paxillin Y88F mutant, these cells exhibit reduced tumorigenicity. This suggests that PTPrho may function as a tumor suppressor protein by regulating paxillin phosphorylation.

The genus is widely distributed in the tropics. Description Orchids in the genus Crepidium are evergreen, sympodial, mostly terrestrial plants with fleshy stems lying on the ground although a few species are epiphytes. There are two to many relatively large, pleated leaves with their petioles wrapped around the stem, the leaves sometimes lasting for up to three years. Small or tiny, non-resupinate flowers are borne along the end of the flowering stem. The flowers are green, yellow, red, brown or purple and have spreading sepals and petals. The dorsal sepal is usually longer than the lateral sepals and the petals usually shorter and narrower than the sepals. The labellum is erect, flat and usually undivided with two ear-like lobes near its base. The column is short and has two relatively large wings. No nectar is produced and there are two pairs of waxy, yellow pollinia. Taxonomy and naming The genus Crepidium was first raised and formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume and the description was published in his book Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indië. The name Crepidium is derived from the Latin word crepida meaning \\"boot\\", \\"sandal\\", \\"shoe\\" or \\"base\\", possibly referring to the shape of the labellum. Some authors previously included species in this genus in Malaxis but Crepidium have stems lying above ground, broad leaves and an undivided labellum with ear-like lobes. =Species= (See List of species) Distribution and habitat Species of Crepidium are found in tropical countries including China, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast asia, northern Australia, New Guinea, and various islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The greatest diversity is in New Guinea where about ninety species occur. Seventeen species, five of which are endemic occur in China. In Australia there are five endemic species in tropical Queensland and the Northern Territory. Many species grow on the floor of rainforest but some are epiphytes on mossy tree trunks.

There are between three and six relatively large, thin, pleated leaves with their petioles wrapped around the stem. Small, non- resupinate flowers are borne along the end of the flowering stem. The flowers are green, brown, yellow, pink, or purple and have narrow sepals and petals. The sepals are oblong to egg-shaped and spread widely and the petals are usually narrower than the sepals. The labellum is relatively short with three lobes, the middle lobe tongue-like and the side lobes shorter and broad. Taxonomy and naming The genus Dienia was first formally described in 1824 by John Lindley and the description was published in The Botanical Register. The name Dienia is derived from the Ancient Greek word dienos meaning \\"two years\\", referring to the stems which last for two years.

It grows in bogs in temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere.  Taxonomy  It was originally named Ophrys paludosa by Carl Linnaeus. The name paludosa refers to the boggy ground where it grows. In 1891, Otto Kuntze moved it to a new genus of its own called Hammarbya, named after Hammarby, Linnaeus’s summer residence.Harrap, Anne & Simon Harrap (2009) Orchids of Britain & Ireland: A Field and Site Guide, 2nd ed., A & C Black, London. . Alternatively it is placed in the genus Malaxis.Flora of North America, v 26 p 628, Malaxis paludosa  Description  It is a small, inconspicuous orchid which can reach 15 cm in height but usually grows to between 4 and 8 cm. The stem is yellow-green, has three to five corners and grows from a small pseudobulb. There are two, three or sometimes four basal leaves. These are oval to oblong, fleshy and pale green or yellow-green. The edges and tips curve inwards. There are one to three small, scale-like leaves higher up the stem. The flowers grow in a spike-like raceme that is 1.5–6 cm long and bears up to 25 flowers. They are small and greenish, about 2 mm wide and 4 mm tall. They have three sepals and three petals, one of which is modified to form a lip. There is one dorsal sepal pointing downwards and two lateral sepals pointing up. The two normal petals are small, narrow and strap-shaped and curve back around the sepals. The short, triangular lip is dark green with paler stripes and points upwards and forwards. The flowers have a sweet, cucumber-like scent. In the majority of orchids, the flowers are resupinate, twisting 180° during development so that the lip points downwards. In Hammarbya paludosa, the flowers twist a further 180° so that the lip once more points upwards. Charles Darwin noted this feature in his 1862 book Fertilisation of Orchids.Beatty, John (2008) Chance Variation and Evolutionary Contingency: Darwin, Simpson, The Simpsons and Gould. In: Ruse, Michael (2008) The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Biology, Oxford University Press.  Distribution and habitat  Hammarbya paludosa has a wide range around the Northern Hemisphere. In Europe it occurs north to 69° in Scandinavia and south to the Italian Alps, Balkans and Romania. It occurs locally across southern Siberia east to Sakhalin and Japan. In North America, it is found from Alaska east to Ontario and south to Minnesota. (Codes) In the British Isles it is found widely but very locally with the largest numbers in north-west Scotland. It has disappeared from much of England but is more frequent in the New Forest. It grows in bogs near streams and ditches or where there is a slow flow of water over the surface. It prefers acidic conditions but sometimes grows in more alkaline habitats. It most often grows in areas with a good cover of Sphagnum moss but will also grow on bare ground or amongst sedges and grasses. It flowers between June and September in the British Isles.  Reproduction and growth  The flowers are pollinated by small flies. The plant reproduces with seeds or by means of bulbils, small buds which drop off and develop into new plants. The orchid has no true roots and is dependent on fungi in its rhizome to obtain nutrients. The bulbils do not carry fungi from the mother plant and must be infected by the fungi of the right species in the soil in order to develop into a new plant. The rhizome grows vertically in the soil and each year a new pseudobulb develops at the top.  Status and conservation  Hammarbya paludosa is declining across Europe because of habitat loss. It is classed as Nationally Scarce in Britain where it has disappeared from 61% of its former range. It is considered to be Endangered in Wales as several colonies have been lost recently.Dines, Trevor (2008) A Vascular Plant Red Data List for Wales , Plantlife, Salisbury. It has been lost from 66% of its range in Ireland and is a protected species in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is generally rare in North America where it was not discovered until 1905.Correll, Donovan Stewart (1978) Native Orchids of North America north of Mexico, Stanford University Press, Stanford. In Minnesota it is considered to be endangered.Smith, Welby R. (1993) Orchids of Minnesota, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis. Many bogs and wet heaths have been reclaimed for agriculture. At some sites lack of grazing has led to a reduction in the open habitat that it needs while at other sites the habitat has been degraded by overgrazing. Many remaining colonies are small.

ZASP belongs to the Enigma subfamily of proteins and stabilizes the sarcomere (the basic units of muscles) during contraction, through interactions with actin in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Mutations in the ZASP gene has been associated with several muscular diseases.  Structure  ZASP is a PDZ domain- containing protein. PDZ motifs are modular protein-protein interaction domains consisting of 80-120 amino acid residues. PDZ domain-containing proteins interact with each other in cytoskeletal assembly or with other proteins involved in targeting and clustering of membrane proteins. ZASP interacts with alpha-actinin-2 through its N-terminal PDZ domain and with protein kinase C via its C-terminal LIM domains. The LIM domain is a cysteine-rich motif defined by 50-60 amino acids containing two zinc-binding modules. This protein also interacts with all three members of the myozenin family. Human ZASP can exist in cardiac and skeletal cells as six distinct isoforms, based on alternative splicing of 16 exons. There are 2 ZASP short forms (Uniprot ID: O75112-6, 31.0 kDa, 283 amino acids; and Uniprot ID: O75112-5, 35.6 kDa, 330 amino acids); and 4 ZASP long forms (Uniprot ID: O75112-4, 42.8 kDa, 398 amino acids; Uniprot ID: O75112-3, 50.6 kDa, 470 amino acids; Uniprot ID: O75112-2, 66.6 kDa, 617 amino acids; and Uniprot ID: O75112, 77.1 kDa, 727 amino acids). All ZASP isoforms have an N-terminal PDZ domain; internal, conserved sequences known as ZASP-like motifs (ZMs); and the four long isoforms have three C-terminal LIM domains.  Function  ZASP functions to maintain structural integrity of sarcomeres during contraction, and has been shown to be involved in protein kinase A signaling. ZASP has also been shown to co-activate α5β1 integrins along with the protein TLN1.  Clinical significance  Mutations in ZASP have been associated with myofibrillar myopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, noncompaction cardiomyopathy, and muscular dystrophy. Interactions The PDZ domain of ZASP binds the C-terminus of alpha actinin-2 and ZMs bind the rod domain of alpha actinin-2. The LIM domains have been shown to interact with protein kinase C. The cardiac-specific region of ZASP encoded by exon 4 includes a ZP motif and binds a regulatory subunit of protein kinase A.

The Dassaretae, or Dexaroi ( or Δεξάροι), were an ancient Greek tribe of Epirus living from Mount Amyron (Mount Tomorr) to Lake Lychnitis (Lake Ohrid) on the border with Illyria.; . They were the northernmost tribe that belonged to the Chaonian group, one of the three major tribes in Epirus.. In Roman antiquity their territory was considered as part of Upper Macedonia. Classification and organisation Dassaretae initially recorded as Dexari were the northernmost subtribe ( ethnos) of the Chaonians, based on the testimony of the ancient Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus, which is accepted by the modern scholars G.F. Edson, Wilkes, Sakellariou, Hammond, T. Winnifrith and the Oxford Classical Dictionary. \\"The Chaones... were a group of Greek-speaking tribes, and the Dexari or as they were called later the Dassaretae, were the most northerly member of the group...\\" \\"...Hekataios stated that the Dexaroi of the Chaonian group were next to the Encheleis and the implication is that the Encheleis were not Chaonians is borne by the later labelling of them as Illyrians. Thus the Dexaroi, living on Mt. Amyron (the beautiful Mt Tomorr) and extending up to the southern end of Lake Lychnitis were the northernmost tribe of the Chaonian group...\\"; The Dessaretae were initially recorded as Dexaroi (Δεξάροι) by Hecataeus of Miletus in the 6th century BC. He describes them as the most northern tribe of the Chaonians, as a Greek-speaking people residing next to the Illyrian tribe of the Encheleae.. The term Dexaroi is an variant form of Dessaroi (Δεσσάροι) since the x (ξ) is the phonetic equivalent of ss (σσ) in ancient Greek literature. The stem Dassa/Dessa- is also found in the name Dassaretae. The name Dexari retains more archaic features compared to Dassaretae in Greek spelling. The clearest sources provided by ancient authors for the variant Dassaretae date to the period of Roman conquest. It appears that the chief magistrate of the Dassaretae bore the title \\"Strategos\\", a title typically given to the chief magistrates of northern Greek tribes during Roman antiquity.Chatzopoulos, 1996, p. 82: \\"strategos was the title given to the chief magistrate of the other minor northern Greek ethne liberated \\"by the Romans at the same time as the Orestans, and in particular of the Magnetes and the Perrhaiboi (cf. Busolt II 1492-95); it seems that the chief magistrate of the Dassaretans was also a strategos...\\" As for their administrative structure an inscription of the Dassaretae epigrammatically lists the main organs of their state Δασσαρητίων άρχοντες, βουλή και δήμος (The archons, the boule and the demos of the Dassaretae).Chatzopoulos, 1996, p. 104: \\"a Council in both cases complete the main organs of the state, which, in an inscription from Dassaretis, the transitional area between Upper Macedonia, Epeiros and Illyria, are epigrammatically enumerated as Δασσαρητίων άρχοντες, βουλή και δήμος\\" The name Dassaretae is connected to (Dios oros-oreitai Mountain of Zeus) with a certain degree of barbarization. History The Dassaretae were probably neighboring to the north various Illyrian tribes when the later started raiding the Chaonian lands possibly in c. 900 B.C. They were initially part of the wider tribal state of the Chaonians during the 6th century BC. The burials of Tumulis II in Kuci zi in the Korce-Maliq plain that time belonged to Desaretae leaders. At a later period they formed their own independent association. It is likely that before the reign of Philip II of Macedon, Illyrian tribes had occupied Dassaretis since no more information about Dexari is recorded and the siege of Pelium (335 B.C) was described as a campaign of Alexander in Illyria.Hammond, N. G. L. \\"The Kingdoms in Illyria circa 400-167 B.C.\\" The Annual of the British School at Athens, vol. 61, 1966, pp. 239–253. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/30103175. Accessed 15 May 2020. Page 247: \\"It is likely that Illyrian tribes occupied Dassaretis before the time of Philip II, because the Dexari disappeared and Alexander's campaign at Pelium was described as a campaign in Illyria\\" During the reign of Philip II (359–336 BC) the Macedonians managed to terminate the Dardanian rule in the land of the Dassaretae. As such the Dassaretae became not only independent again but Philip also managed to create a Macedonian buffer zone on their northern border with the Dardanians. The destruction of Pelium in 335 BC by Dardanian Cleitus came probably due to the fact that the local Dassaratean inhabitants were not friendly towards the Dardanian raiders. Macedonian control was re- established in Dassaretis that year and remained as such during the era of Macedonian domination. In 319-317 B.C an Epirote army under Polyperchon and Olympias marched against the local settlement of Euia during their struggle against Cassander of Macedon.Winthrop Lindsay-Adams, Cassander and the Greek City-States (319-317B.C.), Balkan Studies, p. 210-211 Antipatrea (modern Berat) was founded by the regent of Macedon, Antipater. During the reign of Pyrrhus of Epirus (306–302, 297–272 BC) Dassaretis came possibly into Epirote control. In 217 BC Illyrian Scerdilaidas advanced against Philip V of Macedonia through the region of Pelagonia and the Dassaretian territory capturing Antipatreia, Chrysondyon, and Gertus. He penetrated further with raids into the nearby Macedonian areas like Orestis. However, before the end of autumn of the same year, Philip V recaptured the three Dassaretian cities and expelled the Illyrian raiders from Dassaretis. Military interventions as well as relations with Macedon from 217 B.C to 199 B.C kept the area under Dassaretean control and the borders of the Dassaretae controlled area reached their greatest extent.Norton, 2007, p. 58\\"In 199 BC it would appear that all of this territory was under Dassaretian control due to their relationship with Macedonia; Macedonia's military interventions in this area since 217 BC kept the Dassaretian borders at their greatest extent... Macedonian military takeover of the Dassaretii in 217 BC.\\" In 199 B.C. a Roman expedition under Servius Sulpicius Galba was harassing the Dassaretae population and pillaging their stored grain and harvest.Norton, 2007, p. 92 Geography The area inhabited by the Dassaretae was called Dassaretis. This area remained the same in terms of geography from the period of Hecateus (6th century B.C.) to the Roman conquest. In terms of Roman-era geography recent research accepts that Dassaretis was part of Upper Macedonia.Chatzinikolaou Kalliopi, Locating Sanctuaries in Upper Macedonia According to Archaeological Data. . , p. 195 They inhabited a region that stretched from mount Amyron (Tomorr) up to the southern coast of lake Lychnitis (Lake Ohrid), and they also lived around Korçë and around modern Berat (Antipatreia) and Dassaretis stretching from modern Skrapar to the southwest shores of Ohrid.Hammond, N. G. L. \\"The Kingdoms in Illyria circa 400-167 B.C.\\" The Annual of the British School at Athens, vol. 61, 1966, pp. 239–253. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/30103175. Accessed 15 May 2020. Page 240: figure 1. According to Ptolemy, the city of Lychnidos (modern Ohrid), on the northern part of lake Ohrid, was also a Dassaretae town for a time though it appears that Dassaretae control was not permanent there. However the territory around this city is recorded as at least a marginal territory of Dassaretis. Their cities were Pellion, Antipatrea, Chrysondyon, Gertus (or Gerous), Creonion, Kellion, Euia and Megara.Chatzopoulos, 1996, p. 95, 100 The main river in the area was the Eordaikos (modern Devoll). The Encheles neighboured with the Dassaretae in the area directly south of Ohrid.Hammond, N. G. L. \\"The Kingdoms in Illyria circa 400-167 B.C.\\" The Annual of the British School at Athens, vol. 61, 1966, pp. 239–253. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/30103175. Accessed 15 May 2020.

Strabo's outline of their territories has been generally accepted\\" =Strategic value= Dassaretis, being economically poor, could not be the centre for a strong polity, but at the same time it was strategically valuable. Any military operations in what is now central Albania would hinge on hilly Dassaretis, because the coastal plains were swampy. It was also important for Macedonia, because the Tsangon pass allowed access between the plain of Florina and Lake Ohrid. Local states at their height of power tended to control the area, as did Bardylis' Illyrian kingdom, Pyrrhus' Molossian kingdom, and Philip II's Macedon.Hammond, N. G.

In Greek mythology Illyrius, according to Appian of Alexandria, had a daughter called Dassaro, from whom sprang the Illyrian tribe of Dassaretae (or Dasaretii).Appian. History of Rome, \\"The Illyrian Wars\\", §2. This genealogy is probably associated with a tribe that lived further north from the Chaonian Dassaretae of the Korce-Maliq region and bore a similar name with the later. In general various accounts about the Dassaretae by ancient authors were supposedly based on prehistorical events and mythical allusions. Tribes of similar names According to N. G. L. Hammond an Illyrian tribe of the same or similar name laid further north between the Dardani and the Ardiaei and next to the Dalmatian coast, which is often confused with that of the Dassaretae of the (Greek) Chaonian group.Hammond, 1989, p. 11-25: \\"...Illyrian Dassaretii on the Dalmatian coast and Dassaretae between Macedonia and Epirus\\". Moreover, Livy keeps a clear distinction between those tribes.Hammond, 1966, p. 253 It has been also argued that a similar spelling is shared in the names of two Illyrian tribes (Dassaretae/-ii and Dassarensis). A possible Illyrian link of the Dassaretae faces many allegedly impenetrable issues in terms of epigraphic and archaeological evidence. Roman era historians Strabo, Livy and Polybius make a clear distinction between the Dexari/Dassaretae and the Illyrians.Hammond, 1989, p. 11-25: \\"It follows from Strabo's statement that the other tribes south of the line and extending down to the Ambraciote Gulf were Epirotic. Of these the most northerly near the coast were the 'Abantes' or 'Amantes' or 'Amantoi', since all these forms occur, and the farthest inland the Dassaretae, known to Hecataeus as the 'Dexaroi, a tribe of the Chaonians, next to the Encheleae' (FGrH i F Io3; and for the Encheleae see Strabo 326).40 The distinction between Illyrians and Dassaretii is seen also in Livy 42. 36. 9 (following Polybius), 'ad occupanda Dassaretiorum et Illyriorum castella'.\\"Kos, 2005, p. 227: \\"Also considered different from the Illyrians were the Dassaretes in Livy\\" See also *Epirus (ancient state) References=CitationsSources=    * * Category:Ancient Greeks Category:Ancient tribes in Epirus Category:Ancient tribes in Albania Category:Dassaretia Category:Greek tribes ","title":"Dassaretae"},{"id":"15030061","text":"Gmina Dobrodzień, German Gemeinde Guttentag is an urban-rural gmina (administrative district) in Olesno County, Opole Voivodeship, in south- western Poland.

Galactosyltransferase I catalyzes the synthesis of the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage in proteoglycans. Proteoglycans in turn are structural components of the extracellular matrix that is found between cells in connective tissues.  Function  Galactosyltransferase I is one of seven β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) enzymes. These enzymes are type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer galactose in a β-1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: β4GalT1 and β4GalT2, β4GalT3 and β4GalT4, β4GalT5 and β4GalT6, and β4GalT7. The enzyme encoded by this gene attaches the first galactose in the common carbohydrate-protein (GlcA-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,4-Xyl-beta1-O-Ser) linkage found in proteoglycans. Manganese is required as a cofactor. This enzyme differs from the other six beta4GalTs because it lacks the conserved β4GalT1-β4GalT6 Cys residues and it is located in cis-Golgi instead of trans-Golgi. Clinical significance Mutations in the B4GALT7 gene that result in a defective galactosyltransferase I enzyme with reduced or absent activity are associated with Spondylodysplastic, formerly progeroid type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The reduced activity of B4GALT7 is associated with a reduced substitution of the proteoglycans decorin and biglycan with glycosaminoglycan carbohydrate chains, and with alterations in heparan sulfate biosynthesis, resulting in delayed wound repair, altered migration, adhesion and contractility of patient fibroblasts. Since mutations in B4GALT7 impair a glycosylation pathway, the resulting subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may be considered a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), according to the new CDG nomenclature. Mutations in B4GALT7 cause Larsen syndrome.

It belongs to the corticotropin-releasing hormone family.  Function  This gene is a member of the sauvagine/corticotropin-releasing factor/urotensin I family. It is structurally related to the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) gene and the encoded product is an endogenous ligand for CRF type 2 receptors. In the brain it may be responsible for the effects of stress on appetite. It is also expressed by beta cells in the pancreas and is co-released with insulin to promote somatostatin release from neighboring delta cells, which provides negative feedback on insulin secretion. In spite of the gene family name similarity, the product of this gene has no sequence similarity to Urotensin-II. = As an anorexinogen = UCN3 could inhibit food intake in animals through the central nervous feeding system.

Orchids in this genus have fleshy, upright stems and small to medium-sized resupinate flowers with narrow sepals and petals. They are native to a region extending from India east to China and Japan, south to Indonesia, New Guinea and Queensland. Description Orchids in the genus Aphyllorchis are leafless, terrestrial, mycotrophic herbs. A few to many flowers are borne on an erect, usually fleshy, unbranched flowering stem. The flowers are resupinate, more or less cup-shaped with the sepals and petals free from each other and similar in length but with the dorsal sepal curving forwards. The labellum is larger than the sepals and petals, boat-shaped and divided into two main sections, an upper \\"epichile\\" and lower \\"hypochile\\". The epichile is attached to the base of the column and the hypochile often with two lobes and turned downwards. Taxonomy and naming The genus Aphyllorchis was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume and the description was published in his book Tabellen en Platen voor de Javaansche Orchideeen.

The AK2 protein is found in the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion.  Function  Adenylate kinases are involved in regulating the adenine nucleotide composition within a cell by catalyzing the reversible transfer of phosphate groups among adenine nucleotides. Three isozymes of adenylate kinase, namely 1, 2, and 3, have been identified in vertebrates; this gene encodes isozyme 2. Expression of these isozymes is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. Isozyme 2 is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and may play a role in apoptosis. Two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene. = AK2 deficiency = Adenylate Kinase 2 (AK2) deficiency in humans causes hematopoietic defects associated with sensorineural deafness. Recticular dysgenesis is an autosomal recessive form of human combined immunodeficiency. It is also characterized by an impaired lymphoid maturation and early differentiation arrest in the myeloid lineage. AK2 deficiency results in absent or a large decrease in the expression of proteins. AK2 is specifically expressed in the stria vascularis of the inner ear which indicates why individuals with an AK2 deficiency will have sensorineural deafness.

Rhynia gwynne- vaughanii was the sporophyte generation of a vascular, axial, free-sporing diplohaplontic embryophytic land plant of the Lower Devonian that had anatomical features more advanced than those of the bryophytes. Rhynia gwynne- vaughanii was a member of a sister group to all other eutracheophytes, including modern vascular plants. Description Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii was first described as a new species by Robert Kidston and William H. Lang in 1917. The species is known only from the Rhynie chert in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where it grew in the vicinity of a silica-rich hot spring. Rhynia was a vascular plant, and grew in association with other vascular plants such as Asteroxylon mackei, a probable ancestor of modern clubmosses (Lycopsida), and with pre-vascular plants such as Aglaophyton major, which is interpreted as basal to true vascular plants. A transverse section of a stem of Rhynia gwynne-vaughanii, Lower Devonian, Rhynie chert Rhynia is thought to have had deciduous lateral branches, which it used to disperse laterally over the substrate and stands of the plant may therefore have been clonal populations. Evidence of the gametophyte generation of Rhynia has been described in the form of crowded tufts of diminutive stems only a few mm in height, with the form genus name Remyophyton delicatum.H. Kerp, N.H. Trewin and H. Hass (2004) New gametophytes from the Early Devonian Rhynie chert. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Earth Sciences, 94, 411–428 Like those of Aglaophyton major, Horneophyton lignieri and Nothia aphylla the gametophytes of Rhynia were dioicous, bearing male and female gametangia (antheridia and archegonia) on different axes. A significant finding is that the axes were vascular, unlike almost all of the gametophytes of modern pteridophytes except for that of Psilotum. Taxonomy Two species of Rhynia were initially described by R. Kidston and W. H. Lang from the Rhynie chert bed: R. gwynne- vaughnii in 1917, and R. major in 1920. R. gwynne-vaughanii was named by Kidston and Lang in honour of their former colleague, the botanist Helen Gwynne-Vaughan. A study of the vascular tissue of the two by David S. Edwards in 1986 lead to the conclusion that the cell structure of R. major lacked secondary thickening bars seen in the xylem of R. gwynne-vaughanii, and was more like the water-conducting system (hydrome) of moss sporophytes. His conclusion was that R. gwynne-vaughanii belongs in the vascular plants, while R. major belongs among the bryophytes. Accordingly, he transferred it to a new genus as Aglaophyton, leaving R. gwynne-vaughnii as the only species of Rhynia. Rhynia is the type genus for the rhyniophytes, established as the subdivision Rhyniophytina by Banks,, cited in but since treated at various ranks. Phylogeny In 2004, Crane et al. published a cladogram for the polysporangiophytes, in which Rynia and the other Rhyniaceae are placed as basal vascular plants (tracheophyes).
