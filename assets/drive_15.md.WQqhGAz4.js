Pomeranian cuisine generally refers to dishes typical of the area that once formed the historic Province of Pomerania in northeast Germany and which included Stettin (now Szczecin) and Further Pomerania. It is characterised by ingredients produced by Pomeranian farms, such as swede (Wruken) and sugar beet, by poultry rearing, which has produced the famous Pomeranian goose, by the wealth of fish in the Baltic Sea, rivers and inland lakes of the Pomeranian Lake District, and the abundance of quarry in Pomeranian forests. Pomeranian cuisine is hearty. Several foodstuffs have a particularly important role to play here in the region: potatoes, known as Tüften, prepared in various ways and whose significance is evinced by the existence of a West Pomeranian Potato Museum (Vorpommersches Kartoffelmuseum), Grünkohl and sweet and sour dishes produced, for example, by baking fruit. Pomeranian farmers were self-sufficient: crops were stored until the following harvest, meat products were preserved in the smoke store of the home, or in the smokeries of larger villages such as Schlawin. Fruit, vegetables, lard and Gänseflomen were preserved by bottling in jars. Syrup was made from the sugar beet itself.

It is native to the southeastern, east-central, and south-central parts of the United States, where it occurs from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. This perennial grass forms tufts of branching stems reaching 120 to 150 centimeters in maximum height. The inflorescence is made up of pairs of feathery racemes, each of which contains pairs of spikelets. Each pair is made up of one fertile spikelet and one sterile. The fertile spikelet has an awn up to 2.5 centimeters long. The spikelets are coated in very long, silvery hairs. In the Great Plains, the grass blooms in August through October. In the Carolinas blooming occurs in September and October and in Louisiana the grass blooms in the fall. One variety of this species, the Florida endemic var. cabanisii, has been treated as a separate species, A. cabanisii. This grass grows in pine and oak forests and on prairie. It is dominant in the pine savanna around the Texas-Louisiana border. It grows in disturbed habitat types such as grazed pastures, ditches, and abandoned crop fields. Old fields in the southern United States are often colonized with the grass and its relative, broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus). In the ecological succession of abandoned fields in the region, the bluestem grasses grow after various annual and perennial weeds but before pines move in to shade them out. Cattle graze on the grass. Northern bobwhite are known to nest in bunches of it.

It was released on CD, LP and digitally by Hip-O Records and UMe. History Starr had considered calling the album Motel California, then Another #9, and finally Wings, before settling on Ringo 2012. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, and mixed in England, produced by Starr and Bruce Sugar. The title is a reference to Starr's most successful solo album, Ringo, which was released in 1973. At less than 29 minutes in length, it was his shortest album to date. Ringo 2012 includes new recordings of two songs that Starr had issued on previous albums: \\"Step Lightly\\", from Ringo, and \\"Wings\\", from 1977's Ringo the 4th. His cover of Buddy Holly's \\"Think It Over\\" was released on the Listen to Me: Buddy Holly tribute album before its appearance on Ringo 2012. The new version of \\"Wings\\" was released as a single a few weeks in advance of the album. The inclusion of the track \\"In Liverpool\\" meant that Ringo 2012 was Starr's third consecutive album to include a song about Liverpool, his hometown. Asked why this was, he told Alan Light of Newsweek: \\"I came to the conclusion a while ago that I do not want to write an autobiography, because all anybody wants is those eight years from 1962 to 1970, and I would have ten volumes before we got there. So I thought I'll do it in song, and do vignettes of certain aspects of my life.\\" Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). The cover photograph and as well as other photographs within the album's artwork were taken by rock photographer Rob Shanahan, who had worked closely with Starr for seven years.

Biography  His relationship with his immediate predecessor, Itti-Marduk-balāṭu, is uncertain. Two brief identical inscriptions written in his name on Lorestān bronze daggers give a grandiose titulary, “king of the world, king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad,” which would be slavishly imitated by his successors. Also, a kudurru has been tentatively dated to this period. A fragmentary epicThe Chronicle of Aššur-reš-iši, VAT 10281, translation at Livius. describes the conflict between the Assyrian king, Aššur-reš-iši, and Ninurta- nādin-šumi, when the disputed upper Diyala border region and the city of Arbela were contested between them, and suggests the Babylonians withdrew (“fled”) the city on the approach of Assyrian forces. CM 14. Although the text is too fragmentary to provide a firm interpretation, it is probably significant that his forces (emūqīšu) penetrated so far north into the Assyrian heartland. He may be the author of a rather condescending letter to Aššur-reš-iši, preserved in two pieces, in which he chastises the Assyrian king for failing to keep an appointment in the border town of Zaqqa, “If only you had waited one day for me in the city of Zaqqa!.” He threatens to reinstate on the Assyrian throne the king’s predecessor to his predecessor, Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur, who had supposedly been welcomed in exile in Babylon following his overthrow by Mutakkil-Nusku, according to a later chronicle. The text features three characters: the servant Qunnutu, his master Ashur-shumu- lishir, possibly another pretender to the Assyrian throne, and Ḫarbi-šipak, the Habirū, who may be an envoy of the Babylonian king, but with no other ancient reference to these individuals their roles are uncertain. He was primarily remembered in antiquity as the father of his successor, the celebrated king Nabû-kudurrῑ-uṣur I. His descendants continued to reign through three more generations until the seventh king of the dynasty, Marduk- šāpik-zēri.

As the type specimen was damaged, the protoconch cannot be described. Probably the first two whorls of the teleoconch were lost. The rest of the type specimen measures 2.3 mm. The remaining three whorls of the teleoconch are well rounded, slightly constricted at the suture and moderately shouldered at the summit. They are marked by four pitted spiral grooves, three of which divide the posterior two-thirds between the sutures into three almost equal areas, while the fourth is at the periphery. The space between the peripheral grooves and the one posterior to it, is equal to one-third the space between the sutures. These grooves as well as those on the base are crossed by many slender axial riblets which break them up into pits. The raised spaces between the grooves are marked by slender lines of growth and many extremely fine spiral striations. The sutures are well impressed. The base of the body whorl is well rounded. It is marked by seven pitted, well incised lines and microscopic spiral striations. The aperture is broadly ovate. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The columella is slender, curved, decidedly revolute. It is provided with a strong oblique fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered with a thin callus.

One year later, in 2011, Rolex introduced the model 116681 which was made from steel and everose gold. At Baselworld 2013, the watch was available for the first time in 904L steel, the model 116680, fitted with a Cerachrom bezel insert in blue ceramic. Originally, the Yacht-Master II used Rolex's 4160 movement but with the introduction of the model 116680 in 2013, the movement was updated to the 4161 movement specifically designed for the Yacht-Master II. All Yacht-Master II watches have a case size of 44mmg  4161 Movement  The Rolex 4161 movement is a chronograph movement with the complication of a programmable timer that counts down ten minutes. The countdown mechanism was primarily designed for regattas where the Starting sequence can last up to ten minutes. The movement took 35,000 hours (nearly four years) to create and is made up from 360 parts. The movement also has a 72-hour power reserve for when the watch is inactive. The countdown mechanism is constructed using a column wheel that extends through the main plate and a vertical clutch. The mechanism makes it possible for the wearer to program in advance of the official countdown time and then start the timer once the countdown has begun, and the mechanism can be programmed to count down 0 to 10 minutes. The countdown feature can be locked and unlocked by twisting the bezel through 90 degrees. The Yacht-Master II was one of the first watches in the world to have a bezel that worked in conjunction with the movement. If the wearer has started the countdown either too early or too late, then the countdown can be synchronized. By pressing the start/stop button, located at the 2 o'clock position, and then pressing the reset button, located at the 4 o'clock position, the minute countdown hand repositions itself to the nearest minute while the seconds countdown hand returns to 0.  Design  All Yacht- Master II models, regardless of metal variants, have a case diameter of 44mm. The bezel has a blue Cerachrom insert apart from on the model 116689 which is exclusively platinum. All Yacht-Masters have a screwdown, Triplock crown and a sapphire crystal designed to be scratch-resistant. The bracelet on all models is an Oyster design with three-element links. The centre link is either polished or gold depending on the model. The clasp has a 5mm extension link built in.

History Symmetry of columns and captals First mentioned in a document dated 893, the layout is that of a Romanesque basilica, with little decoration, giving the facade a sober classicism. The present building, however, contains the structures of an older church, whose date of construction is still a matter of controversy, and whose features are surprisingly close to those of Roman architecture: This church is a rare and good preserved example of medieval classicism, an evidence of survival in Italy, during the Dark Ages, of Roman architectural tradition. The small building can be compared only with monuments as the Baptistry in Florence or the Basilica of San Salvatore in Spoleto.  Description  The gable of the West portal The building is entirely dressed in perfectly smooth white limestone slabs according to a layout of alternating high and low bands, in a system which is evocative of the opus quadratum pseudoisodomum of the buildings of antiquity. The apertures framing sculpted details — within this rigorously geometric design — are also directly derived from the Ancient Roman architecture. This interpenetration of a static, geometric system can also be seen in the arches within the church, where the white and coloured stone is arranged symmetrically throughout, as is found in sixth and seventh century buildings such as the Mausoleum of Theodoric in Ravenna and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem (or in peristyle of Diocletian's Palace in Split, ca. 300 AD). As is also to be seen in the early Christian basilicas in Rome, the interior of the church is divided into functional areas and crossed by a liturgical route which is clearly indicated, down to the smallest detail, by variations in the colour of the marble and by the different types of capital in pairs which match across the nave. There are further reminders in the taste for varietas which (in the same strictly symmetrical context) informs all the sculpted ornamentation, whose careful variations have parallels in the Basilica of San Salvatore in Spoleto and in the capitals of the Temple of Saturn in Rome, rebuilt in the fourth century A.D. A capital example of medieval classicism Finally, the character of the sculpture is unusual. On the one hand, the vegetal elements -geometric, flat and with finely incised details — are set out according to a predominantly paratactic/symmetrical system (such elements are typical of sculpture of later antiquity), while on the other, the designs which are repeatedly copied (including unusual Corinthian variations and rare motifs of the Augustan Age) are typical of the first and second centuries A.D. While the most recent parts of the building correspond to twelfth century architecture (in particular the work of Biduino and his school), the unusual features of the older Sant’Alessandro make it an isolated example in local medieval architecture.

After the synchronization of university extension programs (Volkshochschulen) and their municipal or private sponsors, the German Labor Front (DAF) made its influence felt in two ways. Within its National Socialist Strength Through Joy organization, it founded the German Public Instruction Agency (Deutsche Volksbildungswerk; DVW) in 1935. Moreover, after 1933 it used the Office for Vocational Education and Business Management to influence commercial education. The German Institute for National Socialist Technical Vocational Training (Dinta) gave rise to the German Vocational Education Agency (Deutsches Berufserziehungswerk), which organized \\"practice groups\\" (Übungsgemeinschaften) that by 1938 had 2 million participants; its workplace programs involved another 1.3 million. These operations should be distinguished from the \\"community schooling\\" (Gemeinschaftsschulung) of employers, foremen, and workers through courses in the German Labor Front's Reich schools. Above all, adult education had functions not provided by the mass organizations of National Socialism, with their \\"ideological orientation and selection\\" and their military training. The adult education offerings had more to do with the economic predicament and the demand for continuing education and ideological orientation than with political schooling. During the war, new areas of activity arose through the combining of work with vocational or general-educational correspondence courses, as well as through continuing education for persons with war-related disabilities. In 1943, the DVW established a night school (Abendoberschule) in Munich. It supported social and cultural courses given by so-called guardians of public instruction (Volksbildungswarte) in the workplaces. The 300 offices for public instruction also attempted to mobilize the rural population for culture. Their program of instruction was largely based on a model curriculum created in 1939 by Reich and Gau work groups for adult education. Instead of consolidation of adult education taking place through Reich legislation, a goal aimed at in 1933, the DVW gained dominance through the financial resources made available from DAF dues; in 1943 it was upgraded to a leadership office (Führungsamt) in the DAF. Adult education should not be underestimated as an integrating element, even if its educational offerings primarily served the collective increase of power.

He is a member of the Editorial Board for Cell.https://www.cell.com/cell/editorial-board Education Downward was educated at Eton College and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences from Clare College, Cambridge. His PhD was supervised by Michael Waterfield at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund where he investigated Epidermal growth factor receptor, establishing in 1984 the close similarity between this cellular growth regulatory protein and the avian retroviral oncogene, v-erbB. This work led to the identification of the closely related cellular oncogene ErbB2/HER2, which is over-expressed in a major subset of breast cancers and is the target of the important targeted therapy, trastuzumab. From 1986 to 1989, he was a postdoctoral researcher with Robert Weinberg, at the Whitehead Institute for biomedical research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Research Downward's research investigates cancer biology. His work on the Ras GTPase has made seminal contributions to our understanding of how cellular signal transduction pathways are subverted in oncogenic transformation. His work provided the first demonstration that Guanosine triphosphate-loading on Ras, which is commonly mutationally activated in human tumours, is normally regulated in response to extracellular factors; he went on to characterise growth factor receptor complexes mediating Ras nucleotide exchange, and to demonstrate that GTP-bound Ras binds to and activates the RAF kinase, which controls the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Julian was first to demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is also a Ras effector, important in regulation of apoptosis. He showed that transformation by Ras requires interaction with multiple effectors, which contribute differentially to cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. His work has established that both cell matrix and cell–cell interaction activate the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway, and thereby prevent programmed cell death, and that it is activation of this pathway by oncogenic Ras that allows anchorage- independent growth of transformed cells. Most recently he has focused on identifying unique weaknesses of cancer cells expressing the activated Ras oncogene using a combination of large-scale functional genomics and pre- clinical models of lung cancer.

The county was divided between him and his nephew, Count Philipp I \\"the Younger\\". Philipp the Elder's part of the county was later called Hanau-Lichtenberg; Philipp the Younger's part is known as Hanau-Münzenberg.  Life   The time before the division of the county  Philipp I was born on 8 November 1417 at Windecken Castle, as the son of Lord Reinhard II of Hanau, who was later raised to Count of Hanau, and his wife Katharina of Nassau-Beilstein. Two days later, he was baptized there. He godparents were Johann Trier, Komtur of the Teutonic Order in Frankfurt and Gertrude of Kronberg, the daughter of Frank X of Kronberg (1381–1423) and Gertrude of Hatzfeld (1381–1409), who was at the time married to her second husband Philipp of Frankenstein. Originally, a career in the clergy had been planned for Philipp, as he was a younger son. For unknown reasons, this did not happen; instead he engaged in a military career. In 1448, he fought with the Duke of Cleves against the Archbishop of Cologne. His father died in 1451, and was succeeded by his eldest brother, Count Reinhard III.  Division of the county  = Context of the division = Gravestone of Johann of Hanau-Lichtenberg in the City Church in Babenhausen Count Johann of Hanau-Lichtenberg Count Dieter of Hanau- Lichtenberg Count Reinhard III died in 1452, after reigning only a year. He was succeeded by his son Philipp \\"the Younger\\". At the time, Philipp the Younger was only four years old. This situation presented the Hanau family with a dilemma: * They could obey the primogeniture rule, which had been observed in Hanau since 1375. This would mean hoping that Philipp the younger would live to an adult age, marry and have children, who would continue the dynasty. This would have the advantage that all of the family's possessions would remain in a single hand. It would entail the risk that the dynasty might die out, if Philipp the Younger were to die without a male heir. * Alternatively, the family could ignore the primogeniture decision and allow the next agnate, Philipp the Elder, to marry. This would have the advantage of significantly increasing the probability that the dynasty continued to exist, but the disadvantage that the county would have to be divided. This model also called for urgent action, as Philipp the Elder was almost 40 years old, which was considered quite an advanced age in the 15th century. = Debating the division = The debate over the division of the county is relatively well documented. Two parties took shape in the country and its ruling family. Since Philipp the Younger was still a minor and his interests were represented by a guardian committee, initially consisting of his maternal grandfather, Count Palatine Otto I of Mosbach, his paternal grandmother Katharina of Nassau- Beilstein and his uncle Philipp the Elder. This committee acted as guardians and regents until the county was divided in 1458. Thereafter, Philipp the Elder acted as the sole guardian, until Philipp the Younger came of age in 1467. Otto I was opposed to the division. He supported the interests of his daughter Margaret, the widow of Reinhard III and the mother of Philipp the Younger. He sought to position his grandson as the sole heir of the whole county. The elderly Countess Dowager, Katharina of Nassau-Beilstein, was indifferent as to whether the line was continued via her grandson, Philipp the Younger, or via her second, son Philipp the Elder. She held that the danger of the House of Hanau dying out could be reduced by allowing Philipp the Elder to marry, since he had already proven his ability to procreate.Philipp the Elder had at least one illegitimate son, Johann of Hanau-Lichtenberg. The supporters of Philipp the Elder organized a letter-writing campaign. Relatives of the Count and the most important organizations among their subjects -- in particular the four cities in the county, Hanau, Windecken, Babenhausen and Steinau, and the associations of the Burgmannen of Babenhausen Castle and the imperial castle of Gelnhausen -- as well as the vassals of the Counts of Hanau, all wrote to Otto I and requested that Philipp the Elder be allowed to marry. These letters are archived in the Hessian State Archive at Marburg. = Partition treaty of 1458 = When his daughter Margaret died in 1457, Count Palatine Otto I no longer had a reason to oppose the division. This tipped the balance in favour of dividing the country. A treaty to that effect was sealed in January 1458. Philipp the Elder received the part of the county south of the river Main, that is the district of Babenhausen and the Hanau share of Umstadt. So, the downside of a partition was mitigated by giving Philipp the Elder much less than half the county. Even so, Philipp the Elder was happy that he was finally allowed to marry, and did so later that year. In both parts, the primogeniture statute would continue to apply. In retrospect, the decision turned out well, even if Philipp the Younger did not die childless, as had been feared. Philipp the Elder and his descendants managed to extend their county considerably through their marriages. When the last male-line descendant of Philipp the Younger died in 1642, the country was re- united under Friedrich Casimir, a descendant of Philipp the Elder. = Naming the parts = To distinguish between the two parts of the county, the part ruled by Philipp the Elder was called Hanau-Lichtenberg after he inherited Lichtenberg in 1480.Strictly speaking, one should call his territory Hanau- Babenhausen before 1480, but this is rarely done The other part was officially named Hanau-Münzenberg in 1496. In the literature, the names Hanau-Lichterberg and Hanau-Münzenberg are used to distinguish the parts before these dates, even though, strictly speaking, that is an anachronism.  Reign  In 1458, Philipp the Elder took over the regency for his nephew, Philipp the Younger. This meant that the county was still effectively united, until Philipp the Younger came of age in 1467. Philipp the Elder then moved to Babenhausen, where he added to the existing castle as a residence for himself and his family. The east wing was built in 1460. In this period he co-operated politically with Landgrave Heinrich III of Hesse, Elector Palatine Friedrich I, the counts of Henneberg and Elector Rupert of Cologne, a relative of the Elector Palatine. In 1468, he decreed that the primogeniture rules would be followed in his part of the county, meaning that all but one of his sons would have to choose an ecclesiastical career. Militarily, he fought on the side of Emperor Friedrich in a conflict between the Holy Roman Empire and France over Burgundy and in a military campaign against the Turks. In 1480, the last Lord of Lichtenberg, Jakob of Lichtenberg, died childless. Philipp the Elder inherited one half of Lichtenberg, on behalf of his children, because his wife, Anna of Lichtenberg, who had been a niece of Jakob, had already died. The other half was inherited by Anna's sister, Elisabeth, who was married to Count Simon Wecker of Zweibrücken-Bitsch. By this inheritance, Philipp gained a substantial amount of territory, much of it in the Alsace, making the previously rather small Hanau-Lichtenberg almost as large as Hanau-Münzenberg. The Zimmern Chronicle comments in the inheritance: We can infer how much power and prestige the Barons of Lichterberg in the Alsace must have had, from the power and prestige their heirs, the houses of Bitsch and Hanau, have in our days.Zimmern Chronicle, vol. 1, p. 467  Death  Epitaphs of Philipp the Elder of Hanau-Lichtenberg, his wife Anna of Lichtenberg, and sons Johann and Dieter in the City Church in Babenhausen Grave stone of Philipp the Elder in the City Church in Babenhausen Philipp the Elder died on 10 May 1480, just one day after the partition agreement over the inheritance with Count Simon Wecker of Zweibrücken-Bitsch had been signed. He was buried in the St. Nikolaus Church in Babenhausen. The red sandstone Epitaphs for him and his wife and two of his sons, who died in childhood, have been preserved.Sebastian Scholz  Marriage and issue  Philipp the Elder married on 6 September 1458 in Hanau with Anna of Lichtenberg, (25 October 1442 - 24 January 1474), heiress of the Lordship of Lichtenberg.

Biography  Colonel Michel Lafourcade was born in Bélus, the son of Maurice Lafourcade, postmaster, and Marie Galharret, housewife. He was married to Jacqueline Chardac, social worker, with whom he had two children, Jérôme and Aurélie. Educated at the high school Pierre Loti of Rochefort, then graduated from the school of meteorology of Saint-Cyr-l'École. He began his career with the National Weather, in Beauvais from 1964 to 1966, then in French Guiana in Cayenne from 1966 to 1967. In 1967, after having passed the examination ad hoc,Ministère de l’Intérieur, Arrêté ministériel portant établissement d’une liste d’aptitude aux fonctions d’inspecteur départemental des services d’incendie et de secours, 3 mars 1967. he was appointed inspector of the French Guiana fire and emergency headquarters, with the rank of major. He is then, at age 26, the youngest regional director of France.Ministère de l’Intérieur, Arrêté ministériel de nomination en Guyane, 5 avril 1967.

The special takes place at the Beacon Theatre in Manhattan, New York. In contrast to his previous specials, which had been produced for broadcast and sale on physical media, Live at the Beacon Theater is sold directly from the comedian's website for the cost of $5.00 USD and can be downloaded in 720p HD or streamed in browser. Also in contrast to his previous special, Hilarious, which was released for sale more than a year and a half after it was recorded, Live at the Beacon captures a performance from just a month before its release (November 10, 2011). It later aired on the FX television channel. It later was made available in a Humble Bundle. As stated in the end credits, the film was dedicated to comedian Patrice O'Neal, who died two weeks prior to its release. C.K. considered O'Neal one of his favorite comedians. The film won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Special and received three other nominations. C.K. re-released the DVD, video and audio album for download and streaming on his website in April 2020. Production Louis's production/distribution company for Live at the Beacon Theater is Pig Newton. The company name is a reference to an argument Louis had with his youngest daughter over the proper term for Fig Newtons. Reception Reviews have largely been positive, with most describing the special as of comparably high quality to C.K.'s previous work. Much of the media attention, however, has focused on his decision to forgo not only physical media, but third-party digital distribution channels like Hulu and Netflix, as well as his decision to forgo DRM on the video file. Instead, C.K. included a letter emphasizing the direct relationship between the artist and consumer in the hopes that this would more effectively deter piracy. Although it is difficult to objectively draw conclusions about the model's viability and impact, the comedian himself considered the experiment a success. According to a statement issued three days after the film's release, he claimed to have covered the $250,000 costs of the film and website within 12 hours of its release, and that he had grossed $550,000 as of the time of the statement's writing. Although the film was made available by pirates shortly after release, C.K. believes that the rate of piracy was low due to the low cost of the product, convenient delivery, and the lack of a middle man profiting from its sales. In an interview with Bill Simmons two days later, he said that his gross had increased to $800,000. On December 21, 2011, C.K. appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon where he provided an extensive recounting of the special: C.K. said that 220,000 people had bought the show, providing a gross of $1.1 million. With the proceeds, C.K. said that he reimbursed his company $250,000 for production costs, gave $250,000 in bonuses to those who work for him, donated $280,000 to a mix of charities, and joked he would use the remaining $220,000 to buy himself a new penis (\\"I'm keeping the old one...I'm gonna have an old one and a new one, right there. It's gonna be nice.\\"). The success of the special prompted other comedians, including Jim Gaffigan, Bill Burr and Aziz Ansari, to release their own specials with a similar business model.

It is most similar to Jasus frontalis from the nearby Juan Fernández Islands, but is more closely related to species from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Distribution Jasus caveorum is known from a single seamount in the Foundation Seamounts chain, around , approximately south-east of Pitcairn Island, and west of the Juan Fernández Islands, Chile. The seamount has two peaks at a depth of , separated by a col at a depth of . J. caveorum is the only species in the genus whose range is not associated with any land that rises above sea level. J. caveorum was discovered in 1995 by the New Zealand fishing vessel FV David Baker, owned by Southern Seafoods. Commercial lobster traps were laid at various depths, down to ; specimens of J. caveorum were recovered from depths down to , but mostly less than . Ecology and conservation The ecology of Jasus caveorum is poorly known. Its diet is assumed to be made up chiefly of invertebrates. Most adult individuals are infested with a small stalked barnacle of unknown identity; the same barnacle infests crabs of the genus Chaceon in the same locality. Since it occurs in international waters, there are no restrictions on fishing J. caveorum. It is occasionally caught by fishermen from New Zealand, and may have been fished more intensively in the 1960s. The state of the stock is unknown, and the species is listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List. Description The specimens of Jasus caveorum examined for the species description varied in carapace length from . Morphologically, J. caveorum is most similar to J. frontalis, which lives around the Juan Fernández and Desventuradas Islands. It is, however, more closely related to J. tristani and J. paulensis from Tristan da Cunha and the islands of the southern Indian Ocean, respectively. The two species differ in that J. frontalis has sculpturing on the second to sixth abdominal tergae, which is missing in J. caveorum, and in the presence of a row of setae and small spines on the second pereiopod of J. caveorum, but not on that of J. frontalis. Taxonomy Jasus caveorum was described in 1995 by W. R. Webber of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, and J. D. Booth of the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. The specific epithet ' commemorates Joe Cave, Helen Cave and Ernie Cave; it is also a play on the word \\"cave\\", since the species occurs in a hidden area, with no above- ground presence.

The text of the bill is available for public comment at keepthewebopen.com . Wyden first introduced OPEN in the Senate (S. 2029) on December 17, 2011, with co- sponsors Jerry Moran of Kansas and Maria Cantwell of Washington. Issa and 25 co-sponsors introduced OPEN in the House (H.R. 3782) on January 18, 2012. The Senate bill has been referred to the Finance Committee, and the House bill has been referred to the Judiciary Committee.Grant Gross, \\"Issa introduces SOPA alternative in the House\\" (January 19, 2012). IDG News Service.\\"H.R. 3782.\\" GovTrack.\\"S. 2029: Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act.\\" GovTrack. On January 14, 2012, in response to two White House petitions, White House technology officials Victoria Espinel, Aneesh Chopra, and Howard Schmidt stated: \\"Any effort to combat online piracy must guard against the risk of online censorship of lawful activity and must not inhibit innovation by our dynamic businesses large and small...We must avoid creating new cybersecurity risks or disrupting the underlying architecture of the Internet.\\" Comparison with SOPA and PIPA/PROTECT IP Act The OPEN Act was proposed as an alternative to the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), which was approved by the United States Senate Judiciary Committee in May 2011, and the closely related Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which was introduced by House Judiciary Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) in November. After an initial description on December 2 as an outline of possible approaches written by a bipartisan group of eleven lawmakers, a draft text was made public on December 8, 2011, in advance of a House Judiciary markup of the SOPA Act the following week. The OPEN Act seeks to stop transfers of money to foreign websites whose primary purpose is piracy or counterfeiting, whereas SOPA and PIPA also seek to require Internet providers and search engines to redirect users away from viewing the sites. The PROTECT IP Act proposed to do this by blocking domain name resolution, whereas SOPA imposes a broader requirement for network providers to \\"prevent access by its subscribers located within the United States\\" including blocking by IP address and possibly deep packet inspection. OPEN places enforcement responsibility on the United States International Trade Commission (ITC), which currently adjudicates patent-related disputes, rather than the United States Justice Department. The ITC would be given power to collect fees from complainants and to hire additional personnel for investigations. Proponents of the OPEN Act describe it on the KeepTheWebOpen website as a way to protect the rights of artists like SOPA and PROTECT IP, but differing from its rivals by not introducing new internet police powers or undermining calls for open internet in closed societies, and by protecting legitimate internet businesses, social media, legitimate websites and internet innovation. They say that their proposal, but not its rivals, ensures that intellectual property cases will be resolved by intellectual property experts, and will target the actual criminals running foreign rogue websites. They criticize SOPA, but not PROTECT IP, for failing to apply due process to judging websites. Reception The OPEN draft is backed by Web companies such as Google and Facebook, whereas SOPA and PIPA are backed by the movie and music industries. The Consumer Electronics Association commended the sponsors of the bill, calling it \\"a quick, effective way to shut down pirate sites without damaging legitimate companies or enriching trial lawyers\\". The bill was also praised by the Computer and Communications Industry Association. Google copyright counsel Fred von Lohmann said for his company, \\"We think following the money, the money that supports foreign rogue sites, is a sensible place to start. It was quite successful in offshore gambling...We've been very clear with members of the committee that we support that\\". The OPEN draft was strongly opposed by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The MPAA's vice president of global policy and external affairs, Michael O'Leary, wrote in the MPAA's blog that the bill \\"allows companies profiting from online piracy to advocate for foreign rogue websites against rightful American copyright holders. It even allows notification to some of these companies if they want to help advocate for rogue websites\\". The MPAA rejects any law that fails to block Americans' access to The Pirate Bay, a BitTorrent tracker which survived prosecution in its home country of Sweden and steadfastly refuses to remove information about infringing downloads from its search index. Darrell Issa maintains that the OPEN act could be effective against the site by targeting even overseas ad networks placing ads on the site, though it is possible that the site could survive without advertisements. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote that the legislation \\"addresses many of the most glaring flaws in both SOPA and PIPA\\" but stated that it is continuing to review and analyze the draft. Public Knowledge deemed the bill a \\"marked improvement\\" that would avoid the \\"vigilante justice\\" of its rivals. Center for Democracy and Technology senior policy counsel Eric Sohn said that the bill's definitions \\"appear to carefully target true bad actors—the ones who are willfully fostering widespread infringement--while excluding general purpose platforms and social networking services\\", whose financial focus would \\"starve those bad actors of their financial lifeblood, rather than pursuing the futile and costly approach of messing with the Internet's addressing system\\". Copyright Alliance executive director Sandra Aistars called the OPEN Act \\"impractical for individual artists and creators\\", who would be required to argue in Washington before the trade commission rather than in their home jurisdictions, during a period of up to 18 months. The process would be much faster, however, for sites that fail to reply and participate in the ITC process, according to Issa, who note that the ITC has a \\"rocket docket\\" in which cases are heard more quickly than any federal court. Writing in the Huffington Post, Aistars argued that the bill placed more obstacles for individual artists than for corporate litigants seeking patent remedies before the ITC, saying that fees proposed for complainants in the action were \\"unprecedented\\" and incompatible with \\"justice for all\\", while third parties profiting from the infringement could argue for the decision to be overturned by the Administration without paying any fee. She further stated that the hearing officers assigned to hear cases by the bill were not required to have intellectual property expertise, and that the evidentiary requirement for a site owner to \\"willfully\\" commit infringement would be a mental state impossible to prove for rogue operators refusing to consent to U.S. jurisdiction. Professor Eric Goldman of the Santa Clara University School of Law reviewed the bill in detail for Ars Technica, finding it \\"flawed, but more salvageable\\" than \\"SOPA's disgustingly blatant rent-seeking\\" and praising the bill's due process features and a focus on foreign trade policy. However, Goldman also warned that the burden on U.S.-based payment service providers and ad networks could drive business to foreign competitors and permit domestic and foreign legal action simultaneous with the ITC administrative proceeding, or other abuses. Forbes ran a column denouncing the bill as \\"politically untenable\\" and \\"not a viable alternative because it is a transparent attempt to return a several year effort back to square one, while also entangling it with thorny and debilitating congressional jurisdictional turf battles and even thornier and glacial trade policy politics.\\" Nonetheless, in support of OPEN, The New York Times, in an editorial, notes \\"[OPEN] gives copyright holders powerful new tools to protect themselves. And it goes a long way toward addressing the concerns of Internet companies, protecting legitimate expression on the Web from overzealous content owners\\". Public comment using Madison The call for public comment on the draft was described by CNET as \\"the Wiki-fication of part of the legislative process\\".

Education Leslie Dutton was born in England. He received a B.Sc. (Honors) in Chemistry at the University of Wales in 1963, and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the University of Wales in 1967. Research In 1968, Leslie Dutton joined the University of Pennsylvania, where he now leads the Dutton lab at the Perelman School of Medicine. He is also Principal Investigator at the Photosynthetic Antenna Research Center. Dr. Dutton attempts to understand elementary processes of oxidation-reduction and related biological events. Natural enzymes called oxidoreductases are involved in biological functions including gene regulation, signalling, long range electron transfer, energy conversion (in photosynthesis and respiration), atom transport, drug detoxification, and enzyme catalysis. Using physical, chemical and computational methods, the Dutton lab studies oxidoreductases and redox proteins to discover mechanisms of electron transfer over large distances through proteins and understand quantum mechanical electron tunneling theory. Understanding electron tunnelling gives scientists a foundation for investigation of biological redox reactions and their relationship to chemical events such as proton exchange, protein conformation, and energy conversion. Through their understanding of such processes, Dutton and his lab have been able to manipulate electron transfer in structured highly simplified settings, and create man-made versions of proteins. Such maquettes, simple versions of their highly complex biological counterparts, enable researchers to model the minimal requirements for function. Futuristic applications could include creation of clean energy sources and prevention of genetic and age-related diseases.

(C) At the initiation of blood flow (approximately 10 somite) the vasculature begins to be remodelled into a more efficient network. (D - F) Progressive stages of vascular remodelling, culminating in the stereotypical circulatory system seen in (F).Walls, J.R., Coultas L., et al. (2008) Three- dimensional analysis of vascular development in the mouse embryo. PLoS ONE 3(8): e2853. Vascular remodelling is a process which begins usually at day 22, and continues to around the tenth week of human embryogenesis, when, on day 22, an immature heart begins contracting, pushing fluid through the early vasculature. This first passage of fluid initiates a signal cascade and cell movement based on physical cues including shear stress and circumferential stress, which is necessary for the remodelling of the vascular network, arterial-venous identity, angiogenesis, and the regulation of genes through mechanotransduction. This embryonic process is necessary for the future stability of the mature vascular network.Jones, E.A.V., et al. (December, 2006). What Determines Blood Vessel Structure? Genetic Prespecification vs. Hemodynamics. Physiology 21: 388 – 395. Vasculogenesis is the initial establishment of the components of the blood vessel network, or vascular tree. This is dictated by genetic factors and has no inherent function other than to lay down the preliminary outline of the circulatory system. Once fluid flow begins, biomechanical and hemodynamic inputs are applied to the system set up by vasculogenesis, and the active remodelling process can begin. Physical cues such as pressure, velocity, flow patterns, and shear stress are known to act on the vascular network in a number of ways, including branching morphogenesis, enlargement of vessels in high-flow areas, angiogenesis, and the development of vein valves. The mechanotransduction of these physical cues to endothelial and smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall can also trigger the promotion or repression of certain genes which are responsible for vasodilation, cell alignment, and other shear stress-mitigating factors. This relationship between genetics and environment is not clearly understood, but researchers are attempting to clarify it by combining reliable genetic techniques, such as genetically-ablated model organisms and tissues, with new technologies developed to measure and track flow patterns, velocity profiles, and pressure fluctuations in vivo. Both in vivo study and modelling are necessary tools to understand this complex process. Vascular remodelling is pertinent to wound healing and proper integration of tissue grafting and organ donations. Promoting an active remodelling process in some cases could help patients recover faster and retain functional use of donated tissues. However, outside of wound healing, chronic vascular remodelling in the adult is often symptomatic of cardiovascular disease. Thus, increased understanding of this biomedical phenomenon could aid in the development of therapeutics or preventative measures to combat diseases such as atherosclerosis.  Historical view  Over 100 years ago, Thoma observed that increases in local blood flow cause widening of the vessel diameter and he even went so far as to postulate that blood flow might be responsible for the growth and development of blood vessels Thoma, R. (1893). Untersuchungen ü ber die Histogenese und Histo- mechanik des 1186 Gefä ßsystems. Stuttgart, Germany: Ferdinand Enke . Subsequently, Chapman in 1918 discovered that removing a chick embryo's heart disrupted the remodelling process, but the initial vessel patterns laid down by vasculogenesis remained undisturbed. Next, in 1926 Murray proposed that vessel diameter was proportional to the amount of shear stress at the vessel wall; that is, that vessels actively adapted to flow patterns based on physical cues from the environment, such as shear stress. The chemical basis of morphogenesis,\\" written in 1952 by mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing advocated for various biological models based on molecular diffusion of nutrients.Fleury, V. (2000). Branching morphogenesis in a reaction-diffusion model. Physical Review E 61: 4156 – 4160. However, a diffusive model of vascular development would seem to fall short of the complexity of capillary beds and the interwoven network of arteries and veins.Nguyen, T-H., et al. (June, 2006). Dynamics of branching morphogenesis: The effect of blood and tissue flow. Physical Review E 73. In 2000, Fleury proposed that instead of diffusive molecules bearing responsibility for the branching morphogenesis of the vascular tree, a long-range morphogen may be implicated. In this model, a traveling pressure wave would act upon the vasculature via shear stress to rearrange branches into the lowest-energy configuration by widening vessels carrying increased blood flow and rearranging networks upon the initiation of fluid flow.Koller, A. and Kaley, G. (1996). Shear stress dependent regulation of vascular resistance in health and disease: Role of endothelium. Endothelium 4: 247 – 272. It is known that mechanical forces can have a dramatic impact on the morphology and complexity of the vascular tree. However, these forces have comparably little impact on the diffusion of nutrients, and it therefore seems unlikely that acquisition of nutrients and oxygen plays a significant role in embryonic vascular remodelling. It is now widely accepted that vascular remodelling in the embryo is a process distinct from vasculogenesis; however these two processes are inextricably linked. Vasculogenesis occurs prior to vascular remodelling, but is a necessary step in the development of the blood vessel network and has implications on the identification of vessels as either arterial or venous. Once contraction of the heart begins, vascular remodelling progresses via the interplay of forces resulting from biomechanical cues and fluid dynamics, which are translated by mechanotransduction to changes at cellular and genetic levels.  Vasculogenesis  Human embryo at approximately 30 days, showing development of various structures including the yolk sac. From Gray's anatomy. Vasculogenesis is the formation of early vasculature, which is laid down by genetic factors.Jones, E.A.V. (April, 2010). Mechanotransduction and blood fluid dynamics in developing blood vessels. Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering 88: 136 – 143. Structures called blood islands form in the mesoderm layer of the yolk sac by cellular differentiation of hemangioblasts into endothelial and red blood cells. Next, the capillary plexus forms as endothelial cells migrate outward from blood islands and form a random network of continuous strands. These strands then undergo a process called lumenization, the spontaneous rearrangement of endothelial cells from a solid cord into a hollow tube.Forgacs, G. and Newman, S.A. (2005). Biological Physics of the Developing Embryo. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. Inside the embryo, the dorsal aorta forms and eventually connect the heart to the capillary plexus of the yolk sac. This forms a closed-loop system of rigid endothelial tubing. Even this early in the process of vasculogenesis, before the onset of blood flow, sections of the tube system may express ephrins or neuropilins, genetic markers of arterial or venous identities, respectively. These identities are still somewhat flexible, but the initial characterization is important to the embryonic remodelling process. Angiogenesis also contributes to the complexity of the initial network; spouting endothelial buds form by an extrusion-like process which is prompted by the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These endothelial buds grow away from the parent vessel to form smaller, daughter vessels reaching into new territory. Intussusception, the phenomenon of a single tube splitting to form two branching tubes, also contributes to angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is generally responsible for colonizing individual organ systems with blood vessels, whereas vasculogenesis lays down the initial pipelines of the network.Taber, L.A. (June, 2001). Biomechanics of Cardiovascular Development. Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering 3: 1 – 25. Angiogenesis is also known to occur during vascular remodelling.  Arterial-venous identity  cardiac vein develops in close proximity to the arterial network, and in early embryos, sections may switch identities from arterial to venous vessels. The classification of angioblasts into arterial- or venous-identified cells is essential to form the proper branching morphology. Arterial segments of the early vasculature express ephrinB2 and DLL4 whereas venous segments express neuropilin-2 and EPHB4; this is believed to assist in guidance of flow from arterial-venous sections of the loop. However, mechanical cues provided by the heart's first contractions are still necessary for complete remodelling. The first event of biomechanical-driven hierarchal remodelling occurs just after the onset of heart beat, when the vitelline artery forms by the fusion of several smaller capillaries. Subsequently, side branches may disconnect from the main artery and reattach to the venous network, effectively changing their identity.le Noble, F. et al. (October, 2003). Flow regulates arterial-venous differentiation in the chick embryo yolk sac. Development 131: 361 – 375. This is thought to be due to the high luminal pressure in the arterial lines, which prevents reattachment of the branches back onto arterial vessels. This also prevents the formation of shunts between the two components of the network. Moyon et al. showed that arterial endothelial cells could become venous and vice versa. Moyon, D. et al. (September, 2001). Plasticity of endothelial cells during arterial-venous differentiation in the avian embryo. Development 128: 3359 – 3370. They grafted sections of quail endothelial tubing which had previously expressed arterial markers onto chick veins (or vice versa), showcasing the plasticity of the system. Reversing flow patterns in arteries and/or veins can also have the same effect, although it is unclear whether this is due to differences in physical or chemical properties of venous vs. arterial flow (i.e. pressure profile and oxygen tension). Another example of the fluidity of arterial-venous identity is that of the intersomitic vessel. At early stages, this vessel is connected to the aorta, making it part of the arterial network. However, sprouts from the cardiac vein may fuse with the intersomitic vessel, which slowly disconnects from the aorta and becomes a vein. This process is not fully understood, but may occur out of a need to balance mechanical forces such as pressure and perfusion. Arterial- venous identity in the early stages of embryonic vascular remodelling is flexible, with arterial segments often being recycled to venous lines and the physical structure and genetic markers of segments being actively remodelled along with the network itself. This indicates that the system as a whole exhibits a degree of plasticity which allows it to be shaped by transitory flow patterns and hemodynamic signals, however genetic factors do play a role in the initial specification of vessel identity.  Biomechanics  Once the heart begins to beat, mechanical forces start acting upon the early vascular system, which rapidly expands and reorganizes to serve tissue metabolism. In embryos devoid of blood flow, endothelial cells retain an undifferentiated morphology similar to angioblasts (compared to flattened epithelial cells found in mature vasculature). Once the heart begins beating, the morphology and behaviour of endothelial cells change.Wakimoto et al. (2000). Targeted disruption of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger gene leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and defects in heart beat. Journal of Biological Chemistry 275: 36991 – 36998. By changing the heart rate, the heart can also control perfusion or pressure acting upon the system in order to trigger sprouting of new vessels. In turn, new vessel sprouting is balanced by the expansion of other embryo tissues, which compress blood vessels as they grow. The equilibrium of these forces plays a major role in vascular remodelling, but although the angiogenic mechanisms required to trigger the sprouting of new vessels have been studied, little is known about the remodelling processes required to curb the growth of unnecessary branches. Examples of biomechanical forces acting on connective tissue. From Gray's Anatomy. As blood perfuses the system, it exerts shear and pressure forces on the vessel walls. At the same time, tissue growth outside the cardiovascular system pushes back on the outside of the vessel walls. These forces must be balanced to obtain an efficient energy state for low-cost delivery of nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the embryo body. When growth of the yolk sac (external tissue) is constrained, the balance between vascular forces and tissue forces is shifted and some vascular branches may be disconnected or diminished during the remodelling process because they are unable to forge new paths through the compressed tissue. In general, the stiffness and resistance of these tissues dictates the degree to which they can be deformed and the way in which biomechanical forces can affect them. The development of the vascular network is self-organized at each point in the tissue due to the balance between compressive forces of tissue expansion and circumferential stretch of the vessel walls. Over time, this means that migrating lines become straight rather than curving; this is akin to imagining two moving boundaries pushing on each other. Straight vessels are usually parallel to isopressure lines because the boundaries have acted to equilibriate pressure gradients. In addition, vessel direction tends to follow the direction of the normal to the steepest stress gradient. Additionally, biomechanic forces inside embryonic vessels have important remodelling effects. Pressure fluctuations lead to stress and strain fluctuations, which can \\"train\\" the vessels to bear loads later in the organism's development. The fusion of several small vessels can also generate large vessels in areas of the vascular tree where blood pressure and flow rate are larger. Murray's law is a relation between the radius of parent vessels to the radius of branches which holds true for the circulatory system. This outlines the balance between the lowest resistance to flow presented by vessel size (because large-diameter vessels exhibit a low pressure drop) and the maintenance of the blood itself as a living tissue which cannot diffuse ad infinitum. Therefore, complex branching is required to supply blood to organ systems, as diffusion alone cannot be responsible for this. Biomechanics act on the vascular network connections as well. Luminal pressure has been shown to direct the recycling of vessel segments to high-pressure areas, and govern the disconnection of vessel segments from arterial lines and reattachment to venous lines in order to shape the network. This type of vessel breakage may even be indirectly responsible for the development of some organ systems and the evolution of larger organisms, as without detachment and migration, large masses of tissue in the embryo would remain disconnected from the blood supply. Once vessels break away from the parent artery, they may also undergo angiogenesis to infest tissues distal to the rest of the network.  Fluid dynamics  Representation of laminar flow between two walls. The pressure gradient at the fluid boundary layer (green) is transmitted to the walls by shear stress. Fluid dynamics also plays an important role in vascular remodelling. The shear stress applied to vessel walls is proportional to the viscosity and flow patterns of the fluid. Disturbed flow patterns can promote the formation of valves and increasing pressure can affect the radial growth of vessels. The primitive heart within the first few days of contraction is best described as a peristaltic pump, however after three days the flow becomes pulsatile. Pulsatile flow plays an important role in vascular remodelling, as flow patterns can affect the mechanotransduction of stress to endothelial cells.Buschmann, I. et al. (April, 2010). Pulsatile shear and Gja5 modulate arterial identity and remodelling events during flow-driven arteriogenesis. Development 137: 2187–2196. Dimensionless relations such as the Reynolds number and Womersley number can be used to describe flow in early vasculature. The low Reynolds number present in all early vessels means that flow can be considered creeping and laminar. A low Womersley number means that viscous effects dominate flow structure and that boundary layers can be considered to be non-existent. This allows the fluid dynamic computations to rest upon certain assumptions which simplify the mathematics. During the first stages of embryonic vascular remodelling, high-velocity flow is not present solely in large-diameter vessels, but this corrects itself due to the effects of vascular remodelling over the first two days of blood flow.Jones, E.A.V. et al. (2004). Measuring hemodynamic changes during mammalian development. American Journal of Physiology. Heart and Circulatory Physiology 287: H1561 – H1569. It is known that embryonic vessels respond to increases in pressure by increasing the diameter of the vessel. Due to the absence of smooth muscle cells and the glycocalyx, which provide elastic support in adult vessels, blood vessels in the developing embryo are much more resistant to flow. This means that increases in flow or pressure can only be answered by rapid, semi- permanent expansion of the vessel diameter, rather than by more gradual stretch and expansion experienced in adult blood vessels. Rearranging the Laplace and Poiseuille relations suggests that radial growth occurs as a result of circumferential stretch and circumferential growth occurs as a result of shear stress. Shear stress is proportional to the speed inside the vessel as well as the pressure drop between two fixed points on the vessel wall. The precise mechanism of vessel remodelling is believed to be high stress on the inner wall of the vessel which can induce growth, which heads toward uniform compressive and tensile stress on both sides of the vessel wall. Generally, it has been found that circumferential residual stress is compressive and tensile, indicating that inner layers of the endothelial tube grow more than outer layers.Chuong, C.J. and Fung, Y.C. (1986). On residual stress in arteries. Journal of Biomechanics 108: 189 – 192.  Mechanotransduction and genetic regulation  A feedback model of genetic regulation. In this case the input is a physical force and the feedback can be positive or negative depending on the value of B. The mechanism by which different types of flow patterns and other physical cues have different effects on vascular remodelling in the embryo is called mechanotransduction. Turbulent flow, which is commonplace in the developing vasculature, plays a role in the formation of cardiac valves which prevent backflows associated with turbulence.Hove, J.R. et al. (2003). Intracardiac fluid forces are an essential epigenetic factor for embryonic cardiogenesis. Nature 421: 172 – 177. It has also been shown that heterogeneous flow patterns in large vessels can create asymmetry, perhaps by preferentially activating genes such as PITX2 on one side of the vessel, or perhaps by inducing circumferential stretch on one side, promoting regression on the other side.Yashiro, K. et al. (2007). Haemodynamics determined by a genetic programme govern asymmetric development of the aortic arch. Nature 450: 285 – 288. Laminar flow also has genetic effects, such as reducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, aligning cells in direction of flow, and regulating many cell signalling factors. Mechanotransduction may act either by positive or negative feedback loops, which may activate or repress certain genes to respond to the physical stress or strain placed on the vessel. The cell \\"reads\\" flow patterns through integrin sensing, receptors which provide a mechanical link between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton. This mechanism dictates how a cell will respond to flow patterns and can mediate cell adhesion, which is especially relevant to the sprouting of new vessels. Through the process of mechanotransduction, shear stress can regulate the expression of many different genes. The following examples have been studied in the context of vascular remodelling by biomechanics: *Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), promotes unidirectional flow at the onset of heart beats and is upregulated by shear stressLucitti, J.L. et al. (July, 2007). Vascular remodelling of the mouse yolk sac requires hemodynamic force. Development 134, 3317 – 3326. *Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), and Kruppel-like factor 2 (Klf-2) are induced by shear stress and may have up-regulating effects on genes which deal with endothelial response to turbulent flow *Shear stress induces phosphorylation of VEGF receptors, which are responsible for vascular development, especially the sprouting of new vessels *Hypoxia can trigger the expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) or VEGF in order to pioneer the growth of new sprouts into oxygen-deprived areas of the embryo *PDGF-β, VEGFR-2, and connexion43 are upregulated by abnormal flow patterns *Shear stress upregulates NF-κB, which induces matrix metalloproteinases to trigger the enlargement of blood vesselsCastier, Y. et al. (March, 2009). Role of NF-κB in flow-induced vascular remodelling. Antioxidants & Redox Signalling 11: 1641–1649. Different flow patterns and their duration can elicit very different responses based on the shear-stress-regulated genes. Both genetic regulation and physical forces are responsible for the process of embryonic vascular remodelling, yet these factors are rarely studied in tandem.,  In vivo study  The main difficulty in the in vivo study of embryonic vascular remodelling has been to separate the effects of physical cues from the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and other signalling factors which may have an effect on vascular remodelling. Previous work has involved control of blood viscosity in early cardiovascular flow, such as preventing the entry of red blood cells into blood plasma, thereby lowering viscosity and associated shear stresses. Starch can also be injected into the blood stream in order to increase viscosity and shear stress. Studies have shown that vascular remodelling in the embryo proceeds without the presence of erythrocytes, which are responsible for oxygen delivery. Therefore, vascular remodelling does not depend on the presence of oxygen and in fact occurs before perfused tissues require oxygen delivery. However, it is still unknown whether or not other nutrients or genetic factors may have promotional effects on vascular remodelling. Measurement of parabolic velocity profiles in live embryo vessels indicate that vessel walls are exposed to levels of laminar and shear stress which can have a bioactive effect. Shear stress on embryonic mouse and chicken vasculature ranges between 1 – 5 dyn/cm2. This can be measured by either cutting sections of blood vessels and observing the angle of the opening, which bends to relieve residual stress, or by measuring the hematocrit present in blood vessels and calculating the apparent viscosity of the fluid. Due to the difficulties involved with imaging live embryo development and accurately measuring small values of viscosity, pressure, velocity, and flow direction, increased importance has been placed on developing an accurate model of this process. This way, an effective method for studying these effects in vitro may be found.  Modelling  A number of models have been proposed to describe fluid effects on the vascular remodelling in the embryo. One point which is often missed in these analogies is the fact that the process occurs within a living system; dead end can break off and reattach elsewhere, branches close and open at junctions or form valves, and vessels are extremely deformable, able to quickly adapt to new conditions and form new pathways. Theoretically, the formation of the vascular tree can be thought of in terms of percolation theory. The network of tubes arises randomly and will eventually establish a path between two separate and unconnected points. Once some critical number of sprouting tubes have migrated into a previously unoccupied area, a path called a fractal can be established between these two points. Fractals are biologically useful constructions, as they rely on an infinite increase in surface area, which in biological terms translates to a vast increase in transport efficiency of nutrients and wastes. The fractal path is flexible; if one connection is broken, another forms to re-establish the path. This is a useful illustration of how the vascular tree forms, although it cannot be used as a model. The diffusion-limited aggregation model has given simulated results which are closest in comparison to vascular trees in vivo. This model suggests that vascular growth occurs along a gradient of shear stress at the vessel wall, which results in the growth of vessel radii.Fleury, V. and Schwartz, L. (1999). Diffusion limited aggregation from shear stress as a simple model of vasculogenesis. Fractals 7: 33 – 39. Diffusion-limited aggregation proposes that an aggregate grows by the fusion of random walkers, which themselves walk along a pressure gradient. Random walk is simply a probability-based version of the diffusion equation. Thus, in applying this model to the vascular tree, small, resistant vessels must be replaced with large, conducting vessels in order to balance the pressure across the entire system. This model yields a structure which is more random at the tips than in the major lines, which is related to the fact that Laplacian formulations are stable when speed is negative with respect to pressure gradient. In major lines, this is always so, but in small sprouts the speed fluctuates around 0, leading to unstable, random behaviour. Another large component of the remodelling process is the disconnection of branched vessels, which then migrate to distal areas in order to supply blood homogeneously. Branching morphogenesis has been found to follow the dielectric breakdown model, in that only the vessels with sufficient flow will enlarge, while others will close off. At locations inside the vessel where two tube split off from one, one arm of the split is likely to close, detach, and migrate towards the venous line, where it will re-attach. The result of the closure of a branch is that flow increases and becomes less turbulent in the main line, while blood also begins to flow towards areas which are lacking. Which branch will close depends on the flow rate, direction, and branching angle; in general, a branching angle of 75° or more will necessitate the closing of the smaller branch. Thus, several important parameters of vascular remodelling can be described using the combined models of diffusion-limited aggregation and dielectric breakdown: the probability that a branch will close off (plasticity of vessel splitting), that a vessel will reconnect to the venous line (plasticity of sprout regrowth), shrinkage resistance of sprouting tips (a balance between external compression and internal shear stress), and the ratio of external tissue growth to internal vessel expansion. However, this model does not take into effect the diffusion of oxygen or signalling factors which may play a role in embryonic vascular remodelling. These models consistently reproduce most aspects of the vasculature seen in vivo in several different specialized cases.  Application to study of disease progression  Neuropilin 2 expression in (A) blood vessels, (B) carcinoma tissue, (C and D) breast carcinoma tissue with co-localized staining for neuropilin 2 and CXCR4, a chemokine receptor. Neuropilin 2 is a known marker for venous blood vessels, indicating the vascularization of the tumour.Yasuoka et al. (2009). Neuropilin-2 expression in breast cancer: correlation with lymph node metastasis, poor prognosis, and regulation of CXCR4 expression. BMC Cancer 2009 9:220. Vascular remodelling in non-embryonic tissues is considered to be symptomatic of disease progression. Cardiovascular disease remains one of the most common causes of death globallyMendis, S. et al. (2011). Global Atlas on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Control. World Health Organization: Geneva. and is often associated with the blockage or stenosis of blood vessels, which can have dramatic biomechanical effects. In acute and chronic remodelling, the increase in shear stress due to the decreased diameter of a blocked vessel can cause vasodilation, thereby restoring typical shear stress levels.Castier, Y. et al. (August, 2005). p47phox-dependent NADPH oxidase regulates flow-induced vascular remodelling. Circulation Research 97: 533 – 540. However, dilation also leads to increased blood flow through the vessel, which can result in hyperaemia, affect physiological regulatory actions downstream of the afflicted vessel, and place increased pressure on atherosclerotic plaques which may lead to rupture. Blockage of blood vessels is currently treated by surgically inserting stents to force vessel diameters open and restore normal blood flow. By understanding the implication of increased shear stress on homeostatic regulators, alternative, less-invasive methods may be developed to treat vessel blockage. The growth of tumours often results in reactivation of blood vessel growth and vascular remodelling in order to perfuse the new tissue with blood and sustain its proliferation. Tumour growth has been shown to be self-organizing and to behave more similarly to embryonic tissues than to adult tissues.Dormann, S. and Deutsch, A. (2002). Modelling of self-organized avascular tumour growth with a hybrid cellular automaton. In Silico Biology 2: 393 – 406. As well, vessel growth and flow dynamics in tumours are thought to recapitulate the vessel growth in developing embryos. In this sense, embryonic vascular remodelling can be considered a model of the same pathways which are activated in tumour growth, and increased understanding of these pathways can lead to novel therapeutics which may inhibit tumour formation. Conversely, angiogenesis and vascular remodelling is an important aspect of wound healing and the long-term stability of tissue grafts. When blood flow is disrupted, angiogenesis provides sprouting vessels which migrate into deprived tissues and restore perfusion. Thus, the study of vascular remodelling may also provide important insight into the development of new techniques to improve wound healing and benefit the integration of tissues from transplants by lowering the incidence of rejection.

He is known for his work on the role of robustness and innovation in biological evolution. Wagner is professor and chairman at the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Zürich.  Biography  Wagner studied biology at the University of Vienna. He received his Ph.D. at Yale University, Department of Biology in 1995. He also holds a M. Phil. from Yale. From 1995 to 1996 he was a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study Berlin, Germany. From 1998 to 2002 he was Assistant Professor at the University of New Mexico, Department of Biology and from 2002 to 2012 Associate Professor (with tenure) at the University of New Mexico, Department of Biology. He was appointed Professor at the University of Zürich, Institute of Biochemistry in 2006. In 2011, he joined the Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies at the University of Zürich. Since 2016, he is chairman of this department. Since 1999, he is also External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico, USA.Andreas Wagner CV  Scientific contribution  Wagner's work revolves around the robustness of biological systems, and about their ability to innovate, that is, to create novel organisms and traits that help them survive and reproduce. Robustness is the ability of a biological system to withstand perturbations, such as DNA mutations and environmental change. Early in his career Wagner developed a widely used mathematical model for gene regulatory circuits,Wagner A (1994) Evolution of gene networks by gene duplications: a mathematical model and its implications on genome organization. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91 4387-4391. (Wagner's gene network model) and used this model to demonstrate that natural selection can increase the robustness of such circuits to DNA mutations.Wagner A (1996) Does evolutionary plasticity evolve? Evolution 50:1008-1023. Experimental work in Wagner's Zürich laboratory showed that proteins can evolve robustness to perturbations.Bratulic S, Gerber F, & Wagner A (2015) Mistranslation drives the evolution of robustness in TEM-1 beta-lactamase. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. 112:12758-12763. One source of robustness to mutations are redundant duplicate genes. Natural selection can maintain their redundancy and the ensuing robustness.Wagner A (1999) Redundant gene functions and natural selection. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 12:1-16.Wagner A (2000) The role of pleiotropy, population size fluctuations, and fitness effects of mutations in the evolution of redundant gene functions. Genetics 154:1389-1401. However, more important than redundancy, Wagner has argued, is the “distributed robustness” of complex biological systems, which arises from the cooperation of multiple different parts, such as proteins in a regulatory network.Wagner A (2005) Distributed robustness versus redundancy as causes of mutational robustness. Bioessays 27:176-188. Wagner showed that robustness can accelerate innovation in biological evolution, because it helps organisms tolerate otherwise deleterious mutations that can help create new and useful traits.Wagner A (2008) Robustness and evolvability: a paradox resolved. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B-Biological Sciences 275:91-100. In this way, robust transcription factor binding sites, for example, can facilitate the evolution of new gene expression.Payne JL & Wagner A (2014) The robustness and evolvability of transcription factor binding sites. Science 343:875-877. An additional consequence of robustness is that evolving populations of organisms can accumulate cryptic genetic variation, inconsequential variation that may provide benefits in some environments. Wagner's laboratory showed experimentally that such cryptic variation can indeed accelerate the evolution of an RNA enzyme to react with a new substrate molecule.Hayden EJ, Ferrada E, & Wagner A (2011) Cryptic genetic variation promotes rapid evolutionary adaptation in an RNA enzyme. Nature 474:92-95. Wagner has argued that robustness can also help resolve the long- standing neutralism-selectionism controversy, which revolves around the question whether frequent neutral mutations – a consequence of robustness – are important for Darwinian evolution.Wagner A (2008) Neutralism and selectionism: A network-based reconciliation. Nature Reviews Genetics 9:965-974. The reason is that neutral mutations are important stepping stones to later evolutionary adaptations and innovations. Robust systems can also bring forth useful traits – potential exaptations – that arise as mere by- products of other, adaptive traits, which can help explain the great abundance of exaptations in life's evolution.Barve A & Wagner A (2013) A latent capacity for evolutionary innovation through exaptation in metabolic systems. Nature 500:203-206. In 2011 Wagner proposed a theory of innovation in which “innovability” – the ability of living systems to create innovations – is a consequence of their robustness, which in turn results from their exposure to ever-changing environments.Wagner A (2011) The molecular origins of evolutionary innovations. Trends in Genetics 27:397-410. One central element of the theory are large networks of genotypes with the same phenotypes, which populations of organisms can explore through DNA mutations, and which facilitate the origin of innovations. Wagner's work has also contributed to long-standing philosophical problems in biology, such as the role of causality and randomness in biological evolution,Wagner A (2012) The role of randomness in Darwinian Evolution. Philosophy of Science 79:95-119.Wagner A (1999) Causality in complex systems. Biology and Philosophy 14(1):83-101. and to our understanding of the relationship between innovation in human technological and biological evolution, such as the importance of technology standards for innovation.Wagner A, Ortman S, & Maxfield R (2016) From the primordial soup to self-driving cars: Standards and their role in natural and technological innovation.

Development of genre The 1877 novel Black Beauty, although about a horse and not a pony, is seen as a forerunner of pony book fiction. Pony books themselves began to appear in the late 1920s. In 1928 British lifestyle magazine Country Life published Golden Gorse's The Young Rider which went to a second edition in 1931, and a third in 1935. In the preface to the third edition, the author wrote: \\"Since then the outlook on children and their ponies has changed very much for the better.\\" She also noted an increase in equestrian pastimes: \\"Five children seem to be learning to ride today for one who was learning seven years ago.\\" Critical commentary The pony book genre is \\"frequently deemed idealistic,\\" \\"cater[ing] for those typical fantasies of perfect friendship with an idealized companion.\\" A critic noted in 1996 that the genre had \\"been relegated firmly to the sidelines\\". A 2009 article posed whether readers of pony-series fiction could do more than simply get another book in the series, much as a young collector of My Little Pony toys would be compelled to add to their collection.

Giuseppe Pelle aspired to replace his ailing father Antonio Gambazza Pelle as capo crimine and keep the title in San Luca at the risk of triggering a conflict between clans. However, Vincenzo Pesce felt that the nomination of Pelle would distort the equilibrium in the 'Ndrangheta and threatened to form a separate organization taking some 30 locali – local 'Ndrangheta organisations – with him. As a result, Oppedisano became the capo crimine instead of Pelle.

He is a former head coach for the Houston Cougars football team. Levine now owns and operates a Chick-fil-A restaurant in the Houston suburb of Missouri City, Texas. A walk-on wide receiver for the Minnesota Golden Gophers under Jim Wacker, Levine became a three-year starter and was twice named to the Academic All-Big Ten team. After his graduation from Minnesota, Levine played arena football for the Minnesota Fighting Pike and started his own sports marketing company (Levine Marketing Group) in 1996. Before coming to Houston, the St. Paul native coached at Texas State, Auburn, Louisiana Tech, Louisville and the NFL's Carolina Panthers. Early and personal life Levine was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to Marvin and Harriet Levine.UH coach takes pride in family, footballLevine joins Jewish exodus of Houston sports scene His father, Marvin Levine, worked as a certified public accountant and played big-band trumpet.Meet Tony Levine: The Most Popular Football Coach in Houston – Tablet MagazineLevine travels lengthy path to UH's top job - The Daily Cougar His mother, Harriet, was a high school guidance counselor. His brother, Jeffrey Levine, is a band and orchestra director at Jefferson High School in Bloomington, Minnesota and is also one of the most accomplished trumpet players on the Minnesota music scene. Levine and his wife Erin have four children (Ben, Asher, Willa, and Eli). High school and college Attending Highland Park High School in Saint Paul, Levine finished ranked in the top 10% of his graduating class and was a multi-sport athlete, playing tennis, soccer, basketball, track, baseball and football. Levine was also a member of the marching band and jazz band, where he excelled at saxophone. He was named a high school All-American saxophone performer in both his junior and senior years. As a high school junior, he joined the football team for the first time and played free safety. His senior year, Levine moved to wide receiver and was chosen for the Minnesota All-State team. He graduated from HPHS in 1991, and had considered studying music at University of Rochester, Indiana University, University of North Texas and University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire, however he ultimately did not pursue a degree in music. In football, Levine was recruited by several Division II and Division III schools, but did not receive any scholarship offers. However, he received a call from a Minnesota graduate assistant coach, Dave Spiegler, to invite him to walk-on as a receiver, which he accepted. Levine paid for his first two years at Minnesota independently. During the second game of the 1993 season against Indiana State, Levine started for injured teammate Omar Douglas. In that game, he caught seven passes for 121 yards and a touchdown. Head coach Jim Wacker then offered Levine a scholarship, and eventually made Levine a starter for the team in the 1994 and 1995 seasons. In his three years playing for the team, he was a two-time Academic All-Big Ten Team member. Levine earned two masters degrees, one in physical education from Texas State in 1999 and one as an educational specialist in adult education from Auburn in 2003.PURDUESPORTS.COM - Tony Levine Bio - Purdue University Official Athletic Site Professional playing career After finishing his career at Minnesota, Levine joined the Minnesota Fighting Pike of the Arena Football League. However, his professional career only lasted the 1996 season, as the team folded thereafter. In his season with the Fighting Pike, Levine caught 8 passes for 83 yards and 1 touchdown. Coaching career Early coaching career In 1996 Levine began his career as a coach, when he returned to his high school alma mater, Highland Park High School. He served as head coach of the freshmen team before he departed for Texas for a position at Texas State. During his time there, Levine rented an apartment at Pennington Funeral Home in Downtown San Marcos. His monthly salary was $976, and he did not own an automobile. Levine walked approximately one mile to campus each day. He simultaneously attended classes as a student, and earned his first master's degree in physical education from the university in 1999. His next career move was to move to Auburn. Similar to his time spent at Texas State, Levine attended classes at the university, and eventually earned a degree at Auburn as an Educational specialist in adult education in 2003. He later held coaching positions at Louisiana Tech, Louisville and the NFL's Carolina Panthers. Houston Tony Levine was hired by Houston head coach Kevin Sumlin to be the special teams coordinator in 2008. During his time in this position, Houston achieved great success, and finished the 2011 season undefeated in regular season play. He was named interim head football coach of the Cougars immediately after Sumlin left his team for Texas A&M; however, on December 21 — eleven days before the Cougars were due to play in the 2012 TicketCity Bowl — Houston dropped the \\"interim\\" from Levine's title and formally named him as the school's 12th head coach. The Cougars then defeated No. 22 Penn State in the TicketCity Bowl.Berman, Mark. Kevin Sumlin is Leaving the University of Houston. KRIV, 2011-12-10.Khan, Sam Jr. Sumlin leaves post as UH head coach.

Levine was relieved after three seasons at Houston on December 8, 2014, with an overall record of 21–17, and three bowl appearances. On what seemed to be a promising year, the Cougars lost their inaugural game in TDECU Stadium to UTSA 27-7--a disappointment compounded by the loss in the opening game to Texas State 30-13 two years prior.\\"Houston coach Tony Levine fired after Cougars' 7-5 campaign\\" Western Kentucky Levine returned to coaching after sitting out the 2015 season, joining Jeff Brohm's staff at Western Kentucky as co- offensive coordinator, special teams coordinator and tight ends coach. WKU finished the 2016 season with an 11-3 record and ranked No. 23 in the nation as Conference USA Champions. WKU finished the season 1st nationally in scoring offense (45.5 points per game), 5th in total offense (523 yards per game) and 5th in passing offense (336 yards per game). Levine was named the National Special Teams Coach of the Year by Phil Steele Magazine at the conclusion of the 2016 season as well. Purdue After Brohm was hired as the new head coach at Purdue after the 2016 season, he brought Levine along to fill the same roles he had at Western Kentucky, with the official announcement made on December 31. Levine announced his resignation after one season in January 2018, saying it was \\"the right time\\" to leave. After coaching During Levine's hiatus from coaching in the 2015 season, he thought about a career change; as ESPN journalist Adam Rittenberg noted in a 2018 story, Levine wished \\"to still impact others while spending more time with his wife and four young children. And, ideally, not leave Houston.\\" As part of this process, he called Eric Johnson, who had left the Iowa staff in 2014 to open a Culver's restaurant in the Nashville area, at Johnson's new restaurant, asking for advice. While he went back to coaching at that time, Levine eventually applied to become a Chick-fil-A franchisee, despite having had no restaurant experience. The company's franchisee selection process is notoriously selective—the company receives more than 50,000 annual franchise inquiries, but opens roughly 100 new locations each year. Nonetheless, the skills he practiced as a coach in leadership, recruiting, and player development transferred well to the company's selection process, and he was approved to open a new location five minutes' drive from his home. While preparing to open his new restaurant, he went through about 700 job candidates before hiring 110 of them—which, by coincidence, is about the same size as a typical playing roster in Division I FBS. In Rittenberg's story, Levine said about his staff, > They're from age 15 to 65 and from every type of background, culture, race, > religion. It reminded me of sitting in homes again when I was coaching. It's > similar, the evaluation of team members and putting them in the right > position. Who's more up for the fast pace, won't get rattled when there's > cars wrapped around a restaurant, can handle the stress and intensity of the > drive-through? The new restaurant opened on May 17, 2018, with festivities lasting a week. Before the opening, Levine held a free lunch and dinner as what he called \\"a live simulation scrimmage\\" for his staff, and the festivities also included a dinner for Levine's former Houston players and assistants. In the Rittenberg story, he made a telling point about the difference between his past life in coaching and his current career, saying, \\"Yesterday, my cell phone did not ring one time. If you've been coaching at the college level, you're normally not able to say that, if ever.\\" Head coaching record Notes References External links * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Jewish American football people Category:American restaurateurs Category:Auburn Tigers football coaches Category:Auburn University alumni Category:Carolina Panthers coaches Category:Houston Cougars football coaches Category:Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football coaches Category:Louisville Cardinals football coaches Category:Minnesota Fighting Pike players Category:Minnesota Golden Gophers football players Category:Purdue Boilermakers football coaches Category:Texas State Bobcats football coaches Category:Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football coaches Category:Texas State University alumni Category:High school football coaches in Minnesota ","title":"Tony Levine"},{"id":"34016039","text":"Reed landscape near Balm Balmer See Golf Club: 9th green with its water obstacle The Balmer See is the southeastern embayment of the Achterwasser on the island of Usedom off Germany's Baltic coast. The northwestern tongue of land, Cosim, together with the two small islets of Böhmke and Werder are designated as a nature reserve and bird sanctuary. To the south is the only golf course on the island - with 27 holes and 120 hectares in area. To the east are the two small villages of Balm (ca. 150 inhabitants) and Neppermin (350 inhabitants); the bay between Neppermin and the Schwedenschanze to the north is called Nepperminer See.  History  Balm was first mentioned in 1236 under the Slavic name of Bialdab. At that time it belonged, together with five other parished on Usedom (Ückeritz, Mellenthin, Loddin, Suckow and Krienke), to the estate of the bishops of Cammin. In a deed dated 15 March 1270 they exchanged these parishes, at the request of Duke Barnim I of Pomerania-Stettin, for Damerow in East Pomerania (near Naugard), that had belonged to the Premonstratensian abbey of Grobe near Usedom. That apart, the history of the region is linked to that of Pomerania and Prussia. The area remained untouched by the historical tourism that had established itself in the Baltic Sea resorts in the 19th century. This was also true for the period from the Weimar Republic to the end of East Germany. Not until after 1990 did the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern take steps to develop the infrastructure of the region. In 1998 the golf course was built together with surrounding hotel and apartment complex. It is intended to form part of an environmentally friendly tourist industry that is in harmony with the natural resources of the landscape.  Nature conservation  Even in the days of East Germany, in 1967, the two small islets of Böhmke and Werder, an area of 118 hectares, were designated as a bird reserve. Around 1980 the numbers of black-headed gulls got out of hand: there were 14,000 of them, their droppings encouraged the rampant growth of stinging nettles and rarer, more sensitive species of bird had no chance. Only when numbers were brought under control and a small herd of Gotland sheep were introduced did the nature of the vegetation change; the numbers of black-headed gulls fell to about 8,000, common terns and black- tailed godwit returned. In addition, gadwall, tufted duck, pochard and mallard breed on the islands. In 1996 the Cosim Peninsula Nature Reserve (85 ha) was established; in GDR times it had been used as pasture and peat bog. Footpaths through salt marshes, reed beds and alder woods cross the area today. With a little luck, the rarer species of bird may be seen on the reedy shores, that breed on both islands. These include the white stork and grey heron. In winter white-tailed eagles may also be seen, west of the nature reserve footpath to the old manor house of Dewichow (small holiday village) and the transition to the lake of Krienker See.

In 1628 Edward Alford was elected Member of Parliament for Steyning. Sources differ as to whether this is Alford or his father, who was also elected for Colchester but was unseated on petition. Alford was knighted by King Charles in 1632. His father died in the same year and the family estates of Hamsey and Offington passed to Alford's elder brother John Alford. Alford also had an interest in Somerset, being lord of the manor of Stanton Drew and his name is recorded at the Taunton Sessions in 1635 in a case of poaching on his manor. In April 1640, Alford was elected Member of Parliament for Tewkesbury in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Tewkesbury and also elected MP for Arundel in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. There was a double return at Tewkesbury but by the time it was resolved Alford had chosen to sit for Arundel.W R Williams Parliamentary History of the County of Gloucester Note: WIlliams confuses Alford with his father Alford was on the King's side in the Civil War, and was disabled from sitting in parliament in 1644.

Its one of the tallest buildings in Faizabad and is a notable example of non-mughal Muslim architecture. Sadly, this monument is a victim of neglect and is crumbling. History The Mausoleum of Bahu Begum created by Nawab Suja-ud-Daula in the memory of his loving wife is famous for the creative architectural brilliance with which it was designed and constructed. Shuja-ud-daula's wife was the well known as Bahu Begum, who married the Nawab in 1743 and continued to reside in Faizabad, her residence being the Moti-Mahal. Close by at Jawaharbagh lies her Maqbara, where she was buried after her death in 1816. It is considered to be one of the finest buildings of its kind in Avadh, which was built at the cost of three lakh rupees by her chief advisor Darab Ali Khan. A fine view of the city is obtainable from top of the begum's tomb. Bahu Begum was a woman of great distinction and rank, bearing dignity. Most of the Muslim buildings of Faizabad are attributed to her. From the date of Bahu Begum's death in 1815 till the annexation of Avadh, the city of Faizabad gradually fell into decay. The glory of Faizabad finally eclipsed with the shifting of capital from Faizabad to Lucknow by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. Excerpts from the website www.columbia.edu ::\\"Bahu Begum\\" (H.H. Nawab 'Umat uz-Zohra Begum Sahiba) was the widow of the third Nawab of Avadh or Oudh, Shuja-ud-Daula (H.H. Shuja ud- Daula, Nawab Mirza Jalal ud-din Haidar Khan Bahadur, Nawab Wazir of Oudh, r. 1754-75). Her maqbara, \\"the finest building of the kind in Oudh\\" (Carnegy, Woodburn & Noble 1870: 26) was not completed before 1858. This date is important since Umrao Jan expressively mentions that her father worked there as \\"jamadar\\". In \\"A Historical Sketch of Tahsil Fyzabad, Zillah Fyzabad, including Parganas Haveli Oudh and Pachhimrath, with the old Capitals Ajudhia and Fyzabad, Pargana Mangalsi and Pargana Amsin\\" (Lucknow 1870), the account on this monument is as follows: \\"The Bahu Begam's Mausoleum. It was arranged by treaty between the British Government, the Bahu Begam, and the Nawáb of Oudh, that 3 lacs of sicca Rs. of her riches, were to be set apart for the erection by her confidential servant Daráb Alí Khán, of her tomb, and that the revenue of the villages to the aggregate amount of sicca Rs. 10,000 per annum, were to be assigned for its support. The Begam died on the 27th of January 1816. Daráb Alí laid the foundations and built the plinth, when he also died, on the 10th of August 1818. Panáh Alí, vakíl, and Mirzá Haider, the son of an adopted daughter, then carried on the work through a series of years when, with the completion of the brick work, the grant of 3 lacs came to an end, and the beautiful edifice remained unfinished till after the mutiny of 1857.\\" (ibid.: 26).'' Monuments in Faizabad The Nawabs graced Faizabad with several buildings, notable among them are the Gulab Bari, the Moti Mahal and the Bahu Begum ka Maqbara. Gulab Bari is a building standing in a garden surrounded by a wall, approachable through two large gateways. The tomb, built in 1816 from white marble, was an attempt to recreate the grandeur of the Taj Mahal at a cost of Rs 3 lakhs. The marble used almost 200 years ago still shines its brightest and provides the Mausoleum of Bahu Begum an aura of immortality. Rising up to 42 meters the tomb also affords views of the Faizabad town and its surroundings. This royal monument in memory of a dignified woman has been maintained well and even today the care taken by the Archaeological department is evident. In this tomb (Gulab bari) had been hidden the treasure of jewellery belonging to Begum Khurshid Mahal, the mother of Nawab Asaf-ud-daulah. The value of this jewellery treasure was Rs. 80 lakhs (eight million), which was a phenomenal, unimaginable fortune in the 1850s. This invaluable treasure was looted and despoiled by Colonel Hunt, a British army officer. Gallery Image:Gulab Bari.jpgGulab Bari, the tomb of Shuja- ud-Daula, husband of Bahu Begum.

They trace their ancestry to two barons found in the 1086 Domesday Book and probably derive from the Brioton and Essay region, near Sées in Normandy. The name Corbet derives from the Anglo-Norman word corb, meaning \\"crow\\", matching the modern French corbeau. Variants of the name include: Corbet, Corbett, Corbitt, Corbit, Corbetts, Corbete, Corben and possibly the variant of Corbin. It has cognates in other languages: the Spanish name Cuervo, for example, which generally means a raven or rook. The underlying derivation is from the Latin word corvus, crow. Generally it is thought to be a jocular reference to a person who was thought to resemble a crow: in hair colour, tone of voice or shape of nose. However, the Scandinavians believed that a raven on the battlefield was a beneficial omen and ensured victory. Furthermore in Italy there are two families called Corvo (or Corbo) and Corvino (or Corbino), in English they mean Crow and Little Crow respectively. These families descend from the Roman gens Valeria, the first descendants of Valeri Massimi while the second descendants from Valeri Poplicola. The surname is really due to an event described by Tito Livius in book 7, chapter 26 of \\"Ab Urbe Condita\\". A battle is described where the Roman military tribune Marcus Valerius was helped by a crow during a duel and for this he took the nickname Corvus. In fact it could be a family that has Roman origins, which is why it is found throughout Europe with the same translated surnames and shields of similar or equal blazons: the Romans, in order to colonize the conquered territories, had the custom of installing some members of the 14 families founders of Rome, like the gens Valeria. History Feudal barons of Caus and their descendants In the Domesday Book of 1086, Roger Corbet and his brother Robert were listed as some of the most important tenants-in-chief of the king and the powerful Marcher Lord Roger, Earl of ShrewsburySanders, I. J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p. 29. Roger is generally believed to have been the first feudal baron of Caus in Shropshire, which was a barony within the marcher lordship of Roger de Montgomerie (died 1094). He was succeeded after 1121 by his son Robert Corbet (d. pre-1155). He was succeeded by Roger Corbet, who himself was succeeded by Robert (died 1222), who left a son Thomas who died in 1274. There followed his son and heir Peter Corbet (died 1300) who left a son Peter Corbet (died 1322), who died childless. The barony then passed to his half-brother John. Although the family soon died out in the senior line, when the barony was lost, cadet branches spread out and thrived. =Corbets of Moreton Corbet= From the eclipse of the senior line at Caus, the most important Shropshire branch of the Corbets was that of Moreton Toret, later called Moreton Corbet, where they had a castle. Members of this branch regularly represented Shropshire, and sometimes other constituencies, in the House of Commons of England over several centuries. They were the among the most powerful and richest of landed gentry families in the county, especially in the 16th century, when there was no resident aristocracy. Together with its offshoots at Stoke upon Tern and Stanwardine, the Moreton Corbet family played a major part in the county's passage through the English Reformation and the English Civil War. Some of the Corbet politicians are featured in the family tree below. The Corbets long retained part of their former vast estates in Shropshire. The Return of Owners of Land, 1873 showed that, of the 13 landowners who owned more than 8,000 acres in the county, two were Corbets: Sir V. R. Corbet owned 9,489 acres and I. D. Corbet owned 8,118 acres.

Moses Corbet (1728–1814) – Lieutenant Governor of Jersey. Most of the Corbets had already moved to or later moved to Guernsey where the family flourished until c. 1956 upon the death of William Corbet, son of Jean Thomas Corbet. By the 20th century the Corbets were the largest land owners in the Vale Parish once known as the Clos du Valle. The Corbets under Jean Thomas Corbet Esq. (1836–1926) owned and operated two granite quarries which they exported stone to England. Louise Corbet, daughter of Jean Thomas married John Bichard and thus together the families created the first glasshouse growing operation in Guernsey; the vast estate was called \\"Les Landes\\". The Corbets entertained King George V and Queen Mary on their visit to the vineries in 1921. The Corbets' Fruit Export Company thrived and they were suppliers to Buckingham Palace. In the 1930s the Corbet family donated land that would become the Corbet Field, an important athletic area. Christian Cardell Corbet, a Canadian artist, is the third great grandson of Jean Thomas Corbet. Notable descendants and relatives of Jean Thomas Corbet include; – Denys Corbet, (1826–1909) – Poet and painter.

(cousin) – Christian Cardell Corbet, FA, FRSA., (born 1976) – Portrait Sculptor and Painter, Sculptor in Residence – Royal Canadian Navy and Benefactor; Regimental Sculptor – The Royal Canadian Regiment.http://www.aroyalportrait.com/ Scottish branch The first Corbet in Scotland came from Shropshire, and settled in Teviotdale under Earl David (later King David I of Scotland) in the first quarter of the 12th century. He is said to have obtained the manor of Fogo which he held as a vassal under the Earls of Dunbar. Robert fitz Corbet appeared in Scotland in about 1116 as one of the retinue of Earl David, who later became King David I. The author, Augusta Corbet, who wrote The Family of Corbet – Its Life and Times, says that Robert was the son of Roger Corbet and grandson of Corbet le Normand. It is said he belonged to the family which held Drayton in Northamptonshire. Robert Corbet was a witness in the instrument or Inquisition made by David, Prince of Cumberland, into the lands belonging to the old Church of Glasgow, and is also a witness in other deeds of David when he was King of Scotland (1124–53). In 1745 the Corbets supported the British Government. When Bonnie Prince Charlie landed in Scotland. Robert Corbet, then provost of Dumfries, rode out with his men to meet him and warned the Prince to stand aside as Dumfries would have nothing to do with him. He then returned to Dumfries and locked the gates against the Prince. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Corbets were busy in Scotland in a variety of occupations, including shipmasters, tanners, tailors, schoolmasters, weavers, etc. In 1784, James Corbett was a weaver in Larkhall and in Hamilton, other Corbetts were prospering in the late 18th century. Janefield, part of the Tollcross estate and now a cemetery, was occupied and farmed by a James Corbett in 1751. The Glasgow line of the present-day Corbetts (which includes the present day Lord Rowallan)(see Burke's peerage) descends from Dr Lorimer Corbett (born 1782) who was a well- regarded Glasgow surgeon, himself from a line of medical men. Today's generation of the direct descendants of Dr Lorimer Corbett of Glasgow can trace their lineage to him and his three sons, Robert Telfer, Andrew and Thomas. In 1859 his eldest son, Dr Robert Telfer Corbett, competed for the Regius Chair of Surgery at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Although unsuccessful, he had the honour of losing out to Sir Joseph Lister, 'the father of modern antisepsis'. In 1864, Robert Telfer Corbett emigrated to New Zealand with his wife and eight children, where many of his descendants now live. Robert Telfer's eldest son was called Lorimer and Lorimer's eldest son was called Robert Lorimer. This eldest son, the grandson of Robert Telfer Corbett and his uncle (named Leech) is associated with the early colonial history of Malaysia. Colonel Robert Lorimer Corbett, CBE, and his brothers Maxwell and Frank were at the forefront of the early tin-mining operations in Ipoh, Malaysia during the early 1900s, owning rubber and coconut plantations there. Robert also had a distinguished military career during the First World War. After the war he settled in England with his family. His children were the last of this line to bear the name Corbett who could trace their direct lineage back through three generations of elder sons, to Dr. Lorimer Corbett of Glasgow. Many of these descendants now reside in the south of England and Canada. The present Lord Rowallan, John Corbett (b. 1947) who traces his lineage back through Thomas Corbett (b. 1822) the third son of Dr. Lorimer Corbett, resides in Ayrshire, Scotland. (Source: Genealogical research on this has been verified through family records, BMD indexes and original research by M. Learmount daughter of Noreen Corbett and granddaughter of Colonel R.L. Corbett CBE). Castles and seats *Acton Reynald Hall is a 19th-century country manor house and park created by the Corbet Family in the 17th century at Acton Reynald, Shropshire, England, and an example of one of the many Corbet Lordships in Shropshire. *Acton Burnell Castle ruins about eight miles Southeast of Shrewsbury, near to the Acton Burnell Church and Hall, claim attention, from the many interesting and historical facts connected with it; it is recorded a Parliament was held here in the year 1283 by Edward I, on which occasion the Lords sat at Shrewsbury, and the Commons in the banqueting hall of the castle here, the gable ends of which still remain; here it was that the statute known by the name of the Acton Burnell Statute or \\"Statuta de Mercatoribus (Statutes of Merchants)\\" was passed. Long before Edward I, William The Conqueror took the Saxon Godric's manor from him and gave it to the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, who in turn conferred it on Roger Fitz-Corbet. It is supposed that Roger, the Domesday tenant of Actune, was ancestor of those Burnels, from whom afterwards the manor took its distinctive title of Acton Burnell. *Alberbury Castle was built by Fulke Fitz Warine in the 13th century and held under the Barons of Caus, was added protection for Shrewsbury Castle against the threat of the Welsh. In addition, Shropshire was also given a Norman sheriff called Warin who held a number of manors around Oswestry. *Caus Castle (also known as, or recorded in historical documents as Cause; Caurs; Chaus; Caws; Caurse; Alretone; Auretone; Averetonee), often described as a fortress of uncommon strength and extent, is about 2 miles southwest of Westbury, Shropshire, England and is located along the Welsh Marches. Caux Castle was built by Roger Corbet (1066–1134) a domesday founder for his family, and is named for his homeland in Pays de Caux, Normandy, France, and was the seat of their Marcher Lordships granted under Roger de Montgomery (Roger de Montgomery), Earl of Shrewsbury (Shropshire) and King William the Conqueror. *Hopton Castle is in the village of the same name and is located between Knighton, Powys, Wales and Craven Arms (Newton), Shropshire, England. Hopton Castle passed by marriage to the Moreton Corbet family in the 15th century. *High Ercall Hall & High Ercall Church (pronounced High Arcal) in the borough of Telford & Wrekin, were owned by the Corbets by marriage to the Newport's. *Longnor Hall A 17th-century manor house built by the Corbets in the Shropshire village of Longnor. The hall displays the Corbet crow arms on its gable end. *Moreton Corbet Castle in Shropshire, England was acquired by the Corbets in 1235, when Sir Richard Corbet of Wettlesborough b. 1191, who married Joan Thoreton b. 1200 the daughter or Bartholomew Thoreton of Moreton Thoret. Sometime around 1560 Sir Andrew Corbet rebuilt the castle and built a new east range with a great hall, to this was added an ornate south range designed in a L-shape by Sir Andrew's son, Robert Corbet. It is this latter addition that stands as one of the landmarks in English architectural history. *Rowallan Castle was the seat for later chiefs of the Corbets which was originally the seat of the chiefs of Clan Muir. *Sibdon Castle in Sibdon Carwood, near Newton, Shropshire, England. The fortified manor at Sibdon Carwood, the predecessor to the 17th-century Sibdon Castle country house, is given the name \\"Shepeton Corbet\\" by a number of historical documents, including that of John Leland (c. 1535–43), who also gives the suffix to Hopton Corbet Castle and Moreton Corbet Castle. This is an indication that the Corbet family owned these fortified manors around the time, of which Moreton Corbet's castle both remains in their ownership and retains the suffix to this day. *Sundorne Castle is home of the Corbet-Pigott family *Wattlesborough Castle was a fortified manor held by the Barons of Caus, which later passed from the Corbets to the John de Mowthe Family. *Siston, Gloucestershire, which branch died out in the late 14th century. The arms of Corbet of Siston continued to be quartered by the Denys family of Siston, which inherited the Corbet estates by marriage, although no children resulted.

Certification was expected by 2012 and by autumn 2011 three flight pre-production examples had been completed and flown. As of 2015 the certification process is stalled and Technoavia has declared that it is no longer involved in the project. Design and development The Rysachok programme development began in 2006. It was designed as a twin engine conversion trainer but is now seen more generally as an Antonov An-2 replacement in medical, survey, parachuting, navigator and air engineer training and other light transport roles. The Rysachok is a conventionally laid out low wing, twin engine monoplane. Outboard of the engines the wings have constant chord and blunt wing tips; inboard, the chord increases toward the fuselage via sweep on the trailing edge. The starboard aileron carries a trim tab and the wing has two-section flaps. The tailplane, mounted at the top of the fuselage, has constant chord. The fin is straight edged and swept. All the tail surfaces have trim tabs and are horn balanced. The Rysachok has a flat sided fuselage with, on each side, a cockpit crew door and four square windows. On the port side the rearmost window is in a wide, sliding freight door behind the wing. Nineteen can be carried in an all-passenger configuration; the navigation/engineer training layout allows for up to nine students and instructors with appropriate repeat instrumentation. The Rysachok can carry six stretcher cases and a medical attendant in its medical evacuation form. Current pre-production aircraft are powered by 580 kW (778 hp) Walter M601F turboprop engines, later production models will have 596 kW (800 hp) General Electric H80 turboprops a development of the M601. The Rysachok has a tricycle undercarriage with inward retracting single mainwheels and a forward retracting twin nosewheel. The Rysachok first flew on 3 December 2010. By mid-2011, five pre-production airframes had been completed. Two were for static testing, two are at the TsAGI flight research institute and a fifth is undergoing flight trials for certification, expected in 2012. Reports on orders differ: Jane's 2011/12 notes a 2008 order for thirty from a \\"government transport agency\\" but Flightglobal's more recent account claims \\"no firm orders\\" in mid-2011.

It is the third part of the Soldier (or Latro) series of books, with two preceding novels, Soldier of the Mist (1986) and Soldier of Arete (1989). Soldier of Sidon continues the adventures of the Soldier series's protagonist, Latro, in Egypt at the time of the Achaemenid Empire.  Plot  This book continues with the conceit of the earlier two books of having the tale arising from the translation of scrolls discovered in the present day, allegedly written in Latro's own hand. Latro suffered a head wound as a mercenary in the army of the Persian King Xerxes at the Battle of Plataea. As Tony Keen in his reviewhttp://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2007/11/soldier_of_sido.shtml states: Latro cannot recall events of more than a day, but on the other hand, he can see gods and demigods. In this book, the gods and demigods encountered by Latro and his companions, in their journey up the Nile in a search for a cure to his affliction, are Egyptian and African, rather than the Greek ones of the two earlier books.

Alexander (born 20 December 1939)Alexander, Bruce. \\"Curriculum Vitae \\" , Retrieved on 12 May 2013. is a psychologist and professor emeritus from Vancouver, BC, Canada. He has taught and conducted research on the psychology of addiction at Simon Fraser University since 1970.http://www.psyc.sfu.ca/people/index.php?topic=finf&id;=74 He retired from active teaching in 2005. Alexander and SFU colleagues conducted a series of experiments into drug addiction known as the Rat Park experiments. He has written two books: Peaceful Measures: Canada's Way Out of the War on Drugs (1990)Alexander, B.K. (1990) Peaceful Measures: Canada's Way Out of the War on Drugs. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. and The Globalization of Addiction: A Study in Poverty of the Spirit (2008).Alexander, B.K. (2008). The Globalization of Addiction: A study in poverty of the spirit. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.  Rat park  The \\"rat park\\" experiments were published in the journal Psychopharmacology in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Alexander and his colleagues found that the rats in their study that were housed in isolation consumed more morphine than the rats in the rat park colony. One of those studies found that both caged and \\"park\\" rats showed a decreased preference for morphine, suggesting a genetic difference. Other studies have supported the conclusions, finding that environmental enrichment induces neurological changes that would serve to decrease the chances of opiate addiction Alexander's work laid the groundwork for a body of work in rodents on the social influences on addiction.  Writings and views  Alexander then explored the broader implications of Rat Park experiments for human beings. The main conclusions of his experimental and historical research since 1985 can be summarized as follows: # Drug addiction is only a small corner of the addiction problem. Most serious addictions do not involve either drugs or alcohol # Addiction is more a social problem than an individual problem. When socially integrated societies are fragmented by internal or external forces, addiction of all sorts increases dramatically, becoming almost universal in extremely fragmented societies. # Addiction arises in fragmented societies because people use it as a way of adapting to extreme social dislocation. As a form of adaptation, addiction is neither a disease that can be cured nor a moral error that can be corrected by punishment and education. In 2014 Alexander published the book A History of Psychology in Western Civilization.Alexander, Bruce. A History of Psychology in Western Civilization. Cambridge University Press (2014).  1995 WHO cocaine research project  One line of research in which Alexander played a key role was actively suppressed by the World Health Assembly. Early in the 1990s the World Health Organization (WHO) organized the largest study on cocaine use ever undertaken. Profiles of cocaine use were gathered from 21 cities located in 19 countries all over the world. Alexander was selected as the principal investigator for the Vancouver site. The WHO announced publication of the results of the global study in a press release in 1995.Goldacre, B. (2009, 13 June). \\"The cocaine study that got up the nose of the US.\\" Guardian. Retrieved 1 March 2011 from https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/13/bad- science-cocaine-study However, an American representative in the World Health Assembly effectively banned the publication, apparently because the study seemed to contradict the dominant myth of addictive drugs, as applied to cocaine. Part of the study's findings were \\"that occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems.\\" In the sixth meeting of the B committee the US representative threatened that \\"If WHO activities relating to drugs failed to reinforce proven drug control approaches, funds for the relevant programs should be curtailed\\". This led to the WHO decision to postpone publication. The study has not been published officially but was leaked in 2009 and is available at WikiLeaks.

Summary The game features digitized representations of boxers, including Foreman himself. This game is similar to the classic arcade game Punch-Out!! and consists of three different modes (exhibition, career, and tournament). Players can choose between three rounds (as in amateur boxing) and 12 rounds (as in professional boxing). Acclaim's proprietary graphics technology was used to create photorealistic digital representations of the boxers.Foreman For Real at allgame Two camera views are available. Career mode has the player start out as the bottom of the world rankings and winning fights makes him move up the ladder until he has to face off against George Foreman for the world heavyweight championship belt. This makes the game similar to the career modes found in most modern sports games. All of the fighters can earn money and are ranked based on their offense and defense. Passwords allow careers to be resumed from certain spots in the game. A coach gives advice on the strengths and weaknesses of each opponent. Punches and jabs are available with several variations. In addition, an AI-controlled judge helps to determine the score of each and every round. Reception Greasy Gus of GamePro remarked that while the Super NES version has faster gameplay and better character graphics than the Genesis version, it is still mediocre in absolute terms, with unengaging gameplay and a crowd which shows no reaction to developments in the fight. He summarized \\"A school bus full of Don Kings couldn't generate any excitement for this fight.\\" The same magazine's Tommy Glide reviewed the Genesis version. He likewise commented on the \\"stiff gameplay\\", and severely criticized the audio: \\"The average music severely drowns out the sound effects in each fight. You won't hear the ref count on knockdowns, the punch effects sound like bad kung fu noises from '70s films, the crowd's silent, and the round bell sounds like someone tapping a children's toy piano.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation slammed the Genesis version as well, commenting that the gameplay ultimately comes down to blindly mashing buttons.

(Ed.) (2005). \\"Classification and nomenclator of gastropod families\\". Malacologia 47(1-2). . 397 pp. Bouchet, Kantor et al. elevated in 2011 the subfamily Raphitominae (which at that point had been placed in the family Conidae) to the rank of family. This was based on a cladistical analysis of shell morphology, radular characteristics, anatomical characters, and a dataset of molecular sequences of three gene fragments. The family was found to be monophyletic.Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011) A new operational classification of the Conoidea. Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Description The Raphitomidae is the largest, most diverse and most variable taxon in the Conoidea, with the greatest number of species and the largest ecological range (from the tropics to the pole) and largest vertical range (intertidal to hadal depths). The shells of species in the Raphitomidae are very variable in shape (buccinoid to ovate, elongate-fusiform, or high- cylindrical) and size (2 to 140mm in height). Similarly, shell sculpture is extremely variable, from nearly smooth to well developed spiral and axial elements and subsutural ramps. Common morphology includes apertural armature rarely well developed, inner lip usually smooth, no operculum, radular tooth hypodermic in character with marginal teeth of variable morphology (including variable length). The muscular bulb of the venom gland is always single- layered. The close relationship of Raphitomidae with cone snails (which are already under intensive study for the pharmaceutical applications of their toxins), makes them an interesting candidate for the discovery of new toxins.Fedosov, Alexander E., and Nicolas Puillandre. \\"Phylogeny and taxonomy of the Kermia–Pseudodaphnella (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Raphitomidae) genus complex: a remarkable radiation via diversification of larval development.\\" Systematics and Biodiversity 10.4 (2012): 447-477 Another characteristic is the multispiral protoconch, which shows spiral striae on protoconch I and diagonally cancellated (\\"raphitomine\\") sculpture on protoconch II.Kantor, Yuri I., and John D.

This is usually based on similarities in shell morphology to species having a \\"raphitomine\\" protoconch. This determination should also ideally be founded on other attributes, such as the type of radula or foregut anatomy or their lack of an operculum.Høisæter, Tore. \\"A taxonomic review of the Norwegian species of Raphitoma (Gastropoda: Conoidea: Raphitomidae).\\" (2016).

He is the current cornerbacks coach for the Minnesota Golden Gophers and the former head football coach at Kent State University, a position he held for five seasons. Haynes previously served as an assistant coach at the high school, collegiate and professional levels for 20 years, including stints as defensive coordinator at Ohio State University and the University of Arkansas. Prior to his coaching career, he was a four-year letterman as a defensive back at Kent State between 1987 and 1991. Early life and education Born in Columbus, Ohio, Haynes graduated from St. Francis DeSales High School and lettered in football, basketball, and track while in high school. Graduating in 1987, Haynes enrolled at Kent State University that year and walked on to the Kent State Golden Flashes football team as a defensive back and led the team in interceptions in his freshman season, in which Kent State finished 7–4 (5–3 and second place in the MAC).https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/kent-state/1987.html Missing the 1989 season with a knee injury, Haynes earned letters for the 1988, 1990, and 1991 seasons and ended his collegiate career with 440 career tackles and second-team All-MAC honors in his junior and senior seasons. Haynes completed his bachelor's degree in criminal justice at Kent State in 1992. Coaching career In 1993, Haynes returned to St. Francis DeSales High School as secondary coach. The next year, he began graduate studies in counseling at Bowling Green State University and served as a graduate assistant on the Bowling Green Falcons football team for the 1994 season. From 1995 to 1996, Haynes was defensive backs and special teams coach at Division II Ferris State. He moved up to the Division I-AA level at Northern Iowa in 1997 again as a defensive backs coach. In 1999, Haynes returned to Kent State to join Dean Pees's staff as defensive backs coach; Haynes coached the safeties and moved up to assistant head coach the following season. Haynes got his first NFL job in 2001 as defensive quality control coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars under Tom Coughlin before returning to the college level in 2002 as defensive backs coach at Louisville under John L. Smith. When Smith became head coach at Michigan State in 2003, Haynes moved there and again served as defensive backs coach. From 2005 to 2011, Haynes was defensive backs coach at Ohio State under Jim Tressel (2005 to 2010) and Luke Fickell (2011); Haynes also was co-defensive coordinator in 2011. During this period, Ohio State finished in the year-end top ten of the AP Poll every season from 2005 and 2010 and were runners-up in the BCS National Championship Game after the 2006 and 2007 seasons.https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/ohio-state/ On December 18, 2012, Kent State hired Haynes as its 21st head football coach. Haynes was fired after the 2017 season, finishing his tenure with a record of 14–45 overall, 9–30 in conference play. Shortly following his tenure with Kent State, Haynes was hired as defensive backs coach at Michigan State. In February 2020, he was hired as cornerbacks coach at the Minnesota.

For these reasons the Breitling is a perfect natural harbour. On the Baltic side the Breitling is bordered by the Rostock quarter of Hohe Düne. On its southern shore is Rostock Harbour, on the northern shore the port of the German Navy. This is where their corvette squadron and the 7th Fast Patrol Boat squadron is based. In front of Hohe Düne, separated only by the Pinnengraben ditch, lies the uninhabited island of Pagenwerder which has been artificially enlarged by dredging.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Hertford and Ware, the archdeaconry of Hertford, and the diocese of St Albans. It is the civic church of the town and of the county. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is the largest church in Hertfordshire, other than St Albans Cathedral, and can seat up to 1,000 people. History The parish dates back to before the 10th century, and a church was present on the site at the time of the Domesday Survey. This church was replaced during the 15th century by a church with a cruciform plan and a west tower. The parish of All Saints was merged with that of St John in the 17th century. On 22 December 1891 the church was destroyed by fire. A competition was held to design a new church, which was won by the Lancaster firm of architects, Paley, Austin and Paley. The foundation stone was laid on 25 March 1893 and the new church was consecrated by the Bishop of St Albans on 20 February 1895. The insurance for the old church paid only £2.800 (), toward the cost, and a further £12,500 () was raised by public subscription. In 1904–05 the church was completed at the west end and by adding the tower. This was done by the Lancaster practice, now known as Austin and Paley, and cost £10,366 (). In 1934 the Memorial Chapel was completed to the memory of those who died in the First World War. New glass doors were added at the west end of the church in 2003. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in red Runcorn sandstone, with lead and tiled roofs. Its architectural style is Gothic Revival (Perpendicular). The plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a northwest porch, a north transept, a chancel with a north vestry, a south chapel, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages, with a half-octagonal stair turret on the north side, and buttresses at the angles. It has a west door above which is a five-light window. In the middle stage are two-light windows and clock faces on all sides. The top stage contains two-light louvred bell openings, one on the north side, and two on the others. The parapet is castellated and traceried, with gargoyles at the corners, and crocketed pinnacles rising from the corners and the centre of each side. The summit of the stair turret is also castellated, and is surmounted by a spirelet. The aisles are divided into bays by buttresses, each bay containing a three-light window. The clerestory has two two-light flat-headed windows in each bay. At the northwest corner of the church is a two-storey hexagonal porch, with angle buttresses, and two-light windows. On each side of the church, at the junction of the nave and chancel, are octagonal turrets with castellated parapets and low domes. In the north transept is a five-light window, and the vestry has two- and three-light windows. The south chapel has three bays, two-light windows on the south side, and a four-light window on the east side. The east window of the chancel has seven lights. On the side walls of the chancel are panels carved with texts; on the north side the text is from Psalm 103, and on the south side it is from the Te Deum. Interior The tower is supported by large octagonal piers. The six-bay arcades are carried on octagonal columns. At the entrance to the south chapel is an oak screen inserted in 1961. Two steps lead up from the nave to the chancel. The alabaster reredos, presented to the church in 1914, contains a carved panel depicting the Last Supper and four saints. In the south wall of the chancel is a small piscina and a twin sedilia. The half- octagonal sandstone pulpit is attached to the pier between the nave and the chancel. The font is of polished fossil limestone, and consists of a carved octagonal bowl carried on a column. The stained glass in the east window, dated 1900, is by Kempe. The stained glass in the east window of the Memorial Chapel was designed by J .N. C. Bewsey, and depicts four martyrs. The glass on the north side of the church is by Shrigley and Hunt. The memorials include fragments of brasses surviving from the earlier church dating from the 15th century. The chapel contains a marble memorial to the 1st Battalion of the Hertfordshire Regiment, designed in 1921 by Reginald Blomfield. The three- manual organ dates from 1899 to 1900, and was made by Henry Willis & Sons. Additions were made to it by the same firm in 1910. It was rebuilt in 1971 by Cedric Arnold, Williamson & Hyatt following fire damage. It was rebuilt again with some additions in 2001 by the Village Workshop. There is a ring of ten bells, all cast in 1907 by Mears and Stainbank at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Organ The organ was installed in 1898 by Henry Willis. The casework was installed, along with a new pedal stop, in 1913. The organ was hand-blown until 1923 when an electric blower was installed. The original specification, including 'prepared for' stops such as the Pedal Ophicleide (added 1971) and Great Clarion (added 2001) can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register at N14556. In 1971 the firm of Arnold, Williamson & Hyatt of Thaxted, overhauled the organ. A total of sixteen new stops were added, mostly in line with proposals Willis made, completing the choruses of Great and Swell, adding mutations to the Choir and enhancing the Pedal. The 1971 specification is stored at N13066 Between November 2000 and April 2001 the Village Workshop restored the organ. The work was in three parts: the complete overhaul of all the leatherwork (most dated from 1899); enhancements to the action and piston control systems; the addition of new stops: a Fanfare Trumpet, Great Clarion (as Willis intended) and 32' Reed (installed in October 2001). All the new pipe-work was specially made to match the Willis originals. External features In the churchyard are a number of memorials, all of which have been designated as Grade II listed buildings. They consists of a chest tomb in white Portland stone dated 1774, a chest tomb in stuccoed brick dating from the 18th century, two stone gravestones from the 18th century, a headstone in carved Portland stone dated 1711, and a group of six headstones dating from the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

The reading of “zer” in his name by Poebel is almost as uncertain, as the character may be MU which would correspond to šuma or similar. His Assyrian contemporary was Aššur-nasir-apli I. Biography He ruled twelve years according to the King List A. At present, there are no inscriptions that have been identified as contemporaneous with his reign and it is only his appearance on the king lists which identify him. There has been some speculation by Hallo, Younger, and others that the Prophecy A textProphecy A, tablet VAT 10179, KAR 421. refers to the kings of this dynasty with King III corresponding to Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, and King IV to Marduk-šāpik-zēri due to the coincidences of their length of reigns. For subsequent kings, the “prophecies” offer poor correlation with their reigns and known events. In this scheme, Marduk-zer-X is represented by King VI, whose text is very broken up but the rivers are said to have filled with silt. This reconstruction depends on the identification of Adad-apla-iddina as an usuper, a position undermined by the discovery of the Walker Chronicle.

These groups, identified in terms of their relationship to structure, are united by kinship, community, religion or other affinities. The functional purposes of this economy of affection involves survival, social maintenance, and development. The kind of personal relationships and dependencies which form the basis for a subsistence economy in East Africa have been superseded by commercial or government services in the developed world. But in such sub-Saharan African villages, as studied by Hyden, their economies have not yet been 'captured' by capitalism and their peasantry remains unproletarianised. The key issue here for Hyden is that the \\"social values\\" of the market are still underdeveloped. The East African peasantry still is able to 'choose' to operate at least partially in the traditional morality-based economy and the true market system. This then explains why a rational response to market incentives might strengthen his position in the economy of affection.Hyden, G.

Now going into its 8th edition, the next edition will take place August 2020 ANIMAZE presents animated film of all genres from around the world which may have limited theatrical releases. The festival's premier edition was held on November 18–20, 2011 and was built around core events which all subsequent editions will contain: * An international film festival and industry conference including masterclasses * Augmented and virtual reality content and symposium and 360° Dome * An international student short film contest International film contest Animaze's first objective is to bring animation professionals from around the world together, to showcase animated content from around the world in the hub of animation industry. Animaze awards a various prize to the winning films as determined by a panel of judges and a \\"Audience Favorite\\" as determined by the viewers. Saturday morning cartoon charity show In an effort to give back to the community, Animaze Festival dedicates one of its shows for a charity screening that pays tribute to an important era in North American animation, the Saturday Morning Cartoon. Each year, Animaze selects a year and a specific television network and highlights the best shows from that line-up with all the proceeds going towards the charity of their choice. Student shorts contest To help get local talent involved in the festival, Animaze holds a Student Shorts contest for animation schools in and around the Montreal area. This event pits school vs. school in an old fashion battle-royal. Each school must submit a collection of shorts from its student body and the schools are judged by their cumulative submission. The judges for this event are representatives from each of the schools in which they rate all the shorts entered except those from their own institution. The school who's combined shorts acquire the highest grade wins the top prize which is an Oscar type trophy and bragging rights for the year as the \\"Best Animation School\\" in town. The contest also recognizes and honors the 3 individual shorts that scored the highest overall mark. The individual winners receive an award certificate and prizes to help them in the progression of their studies. The grand prize awarded is held in high regards by the film schools as they are not being judged or awarded a prize from the Animaze Festival but rather from amongst their peers and it is the other schools that declare the winning animation program. Master class Animaze Festival invites a guest director to address important issues within the animation industry. The lecture is preceded by a feature which the guest speaker was involved with. Classic film tribute To honor animated films of yesteryear, Animaze plays tribute to ground-breaking film which is celebrating an anniversary by screening it again for its fans on the big screen. If possible, the film will be shown in it original 35mm and people involved in the film's creation will be invited to the event.

History Experiment was a horse-powered ferry boat. It was a 12-ton, three-masted boat drawing a few feet of water, about long by beam.) in 1807 to 1810, depending on the source. p. 31 Mr. Varnum Wilkinson, now living (1859), built \\"The Experiment,\\" he thinks in 1809 or 1810. It was propelled by a \\"goose-foot paddle,\\" a large mechanical screw propeller in the water instead of a paddle wheel at water surface. The new technology devised by Grieve and Wilkinson was powered by eight horses on a treadmill. The technology to propel the boat upstream was originally invented by David Grieve and granted a patent 24 February 1801 in the category of \\"Boats to ascend rivers\\". The complete recorded patent was lost in the 1836 U.S. Patent Office fire. The idea of propelling vessels by a mechanical screw in the water is now referred to as Ericsson's propeller. Maiden voyage It is reported that Experiment made one unsuccessful voyage, as it ran aground on the return trip. The mechanism and associated parts were put together by Ephraim Southworth; little thought was put into the construction and it was poorly built.Field, pp. 511–512 The maiden voyage was in June 1809 with a group of gentlemen from the Grand Lodge of the State.Rhode Island Society, p. 30 The first attempt of the \\"Screw Boat\\" began at Jackson's Wharf on Eddy's Point near Providence, Rhode Island, with a destination of Pawtuxet Village. The eight horses for the \\"horse power\\" were owned by Marvin Morris; they were connected to a poorly designed contraption to make the boat move. It obtained a top speed of four knots with the help of a tide going in her direction and the wind on her back. It managed to get to Pawtuxet Village, where there was much celebration over its success. The return trip, however, resulted in humiliation when a gust of wind drove Experiment onto mud flats, causing its demise.Hazard, p. 294 Financial failure The Experiment venture had sold shares of stock from a prospectus to raise money to build it. There was so much confidence in the venture that tickets were engraved by William Hamlin for its anticipated voyages to New- Port and Providence. Ultimately, the horse boat and all the associated items were seized by the Sheriff at the behest of Grieve's creditors and sold for lack of payments on the loans, since it was not a successful venture. Wilkinson later said that \\"after the frolic\\" it was \\"hauled up\\" and allowed to go to waste and ruin. Nevertheless, the ship was carefully studied by Daniel French, who did the drawings for Robert Fulton's North River Steamboat (known as Clermont), and may have benefited that enterprise. Experiment is important as a precursor of public transportation on rivers, and it was the forerunner of a number of horse-powered boats, chiefly ferries used for more than a half- century along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Most commonly, those were paddle wheel boats, not screw-type propellers. Inclined treadmills were often used.

The three highways cross over some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) and then leave the city limits. They intersect US 23/SR 19 (Alma Highway). Here, SR 135 meets its southern terminus, and US 221 Truck and SR 135 Truck turn left onto US 23/SR 19 onto Larry Contos Boulevard. The four highways travel to the north-northeast. Just before passing a Walmart Supercenter, they re-enter Hazlehurst. They cross over some railroad tracks of NS Railway and then intersect US 341/SR 27 (Golden Isles Parkway). Here, all six highways travel to the northwest. At Plum Street, the concurrency intersects the northbound lanes of US 221/SR 135 (since those highways travel through the city on one-way streets). At this intersection, US 221 Truck and SR 135 Truck meet their northern terminus.

R., Pastore, R. D., Yaghoubian, R., Kane, I., Gallo, G., Buck, F. S. & Buxbaum, J. N. (1997). Variant-sequence transthyretin (isoleucine 122) in late-onset cardiac amyloidosis that occurs in black Americans. The New England Journal of Medicine 336, 466-73. TTR amyloid fibrils infiltrate the myocardium, leading to diastolic dysfunction from restrictive cardiomyopathy, and eventual heart failure. Both mutant and wild-type transthyretin comprise the aggregates because the TTR blood protein is a tetramer composed of mutant and wild-type TTR subunits in heterozygotes. Several mutations in TTR are associated with FAC, including V122I, V20I, P24S, A45T, Gly47Val, Glu51Gly, I68L, Gln92Lys, and L111M. One common mutation (V122I), which is a substitution of isoleucine for valine at position 122, occurs with high frequency in African-Americans, with a prevalence of approximately 3.5%. FAC is clinically similar to senile systemic amyloidosis,Westermark, P., Sletten, K., Johansson, B. & Cornwell, G. G., 3rd. (1990). Fibril in Senile Systemic Amyloidosis is derived from normal transthyretin. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 87, 2843-5. in which cardiomyopathy results from the aggregation of wild-type transthyretin exclusively.Ng, B., Connors, L. H., Davidoff, R., Skinner, M. & Falk, R. H. (2005). Senile systemic amyloidosis presenting with heart failure: a comparison with light chain-associated amyloidosis. Arch Intern Med 165, 1425-9.Westermark, P., Bergstrom, J., Solomon, A., Murphy, C. & Sletten, K. (2003). Transthyretin-derived senile systemic amyloidosis: clinicopathologic and structural considerations. Amyloid 10 Suppl 1, 48-54. Presentation The onset of FAC caused by aggregation of the V122I mutation and wild-type TTR, and senile systemic amyloidosis caused by the exclusive aggregation of wild-type TTR, typically occur after age 60. Greater than 40% of these patients present with carpal tunnel syndrome before developing ATTR-CM. Cardiac involvement is often identified with the presence of conduction system disease (sinus node or atrioventricular node dysfunction) and/or congestive heart failure, including shortness of breath, peripheral edema, syncope, exertional dyspnea, generalized fatigue, or heart block.Falk, R. H. & Elkayam, U. (2010). Cardiomyopathy: the importance of recognizing the uncommon diagnosis. Prog Cardiovasc Dis 52, 262-3.Snyder, M. E., Haidar, G. R., Spencer, B. & Maurer, M. S. (2011). Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis diagnosed by analyzing a prostatic tissue sample: a case report. J Am Geriatr Soc 59, 1745-7. Unfortunately, echocardiographic findings are indistinguishable from those seen in AL amyloidosis, and include thickened ventricular walls (concentric hypertrophy, both right and left) with a normal- to-small left ventricular cavity, increased myocardial echogenicity, normal or mildly reduced ejection fraction (often with evidence of diastolic dysfunction and severe impairment of contraction along the longitudinal axis), and bi- atrial dilation with impaired atrial contraction. Unlike the situation in AL amyloidosis, the ECG voltage is often normal, although low voltage may be seen (despite increased wall thickness on echocardiography). Marked axis deviation, bundle branch block, and AV block are common, as is atrial fibrillation. Diagnosis Management Although not based on a human clinical trial, the only currently accepted disease-modifying therapeutic strategy available for familial amyloid cardiomyopathy is a combined liver and heart transplant. Treatments aimed at symptom relief are available, and include diuretics, pacemakers, and arrhythmia management. Thus, Senile systemic amyloidosis and familial amyloid polyneuropathy are often treatable diseases that are misdiagnosed.Falk, R. H. (2011).

He is known as the sculptor of the 10-meter-tall Peace Statue in Nagasaki Peace Park. He is most often referred to as \\"Seibo\\". Biography He was born in what was then Minamiarima, Nagasaki, (now Minamishimabara) on 16 December 1884 and entered Kyoto City University of Arts to study sculpture in 1903. He graduated from there in 1907 and immediately enrolled in the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, from which he received a second sculpture degree in 1912. He began sculpting full-time after his discharge from military service in 1915 and, by 1921, he was a professor at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts. He was inducted into the Japan Art Academy in 1925. Kitamura submitted some of his work into an unknown event of the \\"Mixed Sculpturing\\" category of the art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics, but did not win a medal. He is known as the sculptor of the 10-meter-tall Peace Statue in Nagasaki Peace Park. The statue and the park are near the hypocentre where the atomic bomb exploded on 9 August 1945. The design for the statue was selected in an open contest, and unveiled to the public on 1 April 1955 when the park opened. The statue points to the sky, warning from where the bomb and death would fall, his left hand is stretched out in a gesture of peace, and his eyes are closed in prayer for the souls of those who died. One leg is folded in a position of meditation, but his left foot is on the ground, as he is prepared to stand and assist the people. The statue and park are a memorial to the people of Nagasaki who died in the atomic bomb explosion. Kitamura has received numerous other local and national awards for his work throughout his lifetime. He died on 4 March 1987 in Tokyo at the age of 102. Many of his works can be viewed at Shimabara Castle, where the yagura is a museum dedicated to his life and work.

IPA allows employers to evaluate and maintain potential candidates for hiring, promotion, and development by using a series of job analysis instruments such as position analysis questionnaires (PAQ), occupational analysis inventory (OAI), and functional job analysis (FJA). These instruments allow the assessor to develop valid measures of intelligence, personality tests, and a range of other factors as means to determine selection and promotion decisions. Personality and cognitive ability are good predictors of performance. Emotional Intelligence helps individuals navigate through challenging organizational and interpersonal encounters. Since individual differences have a long history in explaining human behavior and the different ways in which individuals respond to similar events and circumstances, these factors allow the organization to determine if an applicant has the competence to effectively and successfully do the work that the job requires. These assessments are administered throughout organizations in different forms, but they share one common goal in the selection process, and that is the right candidate for the job. Overview In the past, the use of Individual psychological assessment has increased and improved within human resources to evaluate and maintain potential candidates for employment in various levels of position in the workforce. The use of this type of assessment has become defined and set criteria have been developed to test job applicants. By collecting the needed information utilizing the tools listed below, the individual can be assessed as being right for the job at hand. Individual factors Personality Personality is an individual's relatively stable characteristic patterns of thought, emotion, behavior and the psychological mechanisms that support and drive those patterns. The vast majority of investigations of the personality correlates of performance have used the Big Five taxonomy as the basis of their selection of predictors. The Big Five model (or Five Factor Model) holds that personality comprises five dimensions: Openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Of the five dimensions, conscientiousness appears to have the strongest relation to overall job performance across a wide variety of jobs. Leadership style Leadership style is the behaviors of leaders, focusing on what leaders do and how they act. The relates to how leaders delegate and communicate with their subordinates. Their leadership style may be one or a combination of a(n); authoritarian leadership, democratic leadership, charismatic leadership and laissez-faire leadership. Cognitive ability Cognitive ability measures should predict performance outcomes in most, if not all, jobs and situations. Emotional Intelligence Emotional intelligence (EI) is the subset of social intelligence that involves the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions. This form of intelligence allows someone to carry out accurate reasoning about emotions and gives them the ability to use emotions and emotional knowledge to enhance thought. Assessing an individual's EI enhances the prediction and understanding of the outcomes of organization members, such as their job performance and their effectiveness as leaders within an organization. =Branches= There are four dimensions of emotional intelligence: # The Perceiving and Expressing Branch - concerns how accurately and how fast individuals can express emotions and identify, detect, and decipher aspects of emotional experiences and emotional displays # The Using Emotion Branch - concerns how well individuals capitalize on the systematic effects of emotions on cognitive activities such as creativity and risking # The Understanding Branch - concerns how accurately individuals reason about various aspects of emotions, such as when they attach labels to emotions and identify connections between events and emotional reactions # The Regulating Emotions Branch - concerns how well individuals can increase, maintain, or decrease the magnitude or duration of their or others’ emotions Process Information is collected, from an assessor or group of assessors, in person or via other assessment methods. Simulation of exercises related to the job being tested could also be used which takes place in a replicated work setting as the one used on the job. Once all the information is gathered, the assessor(s) presents the information in a special format to the client or organization, grants the participant recommendations based on the assessment and provides feedback to the participant and the organization. Validity The validity of IPA depends on variables such as the standardization of the tests and personality factors, however important variables is the accuracy of the assessor's judgement. More research is required regarding the assessor's judgment to help improve the effectiveness of the assessments. The way that scientists have conceptualized validity has changed over the past several decades, as documented in the several versions of the APA Standards (AERA et al. 1999) and SIOP (2003) Principles. The most recent versions of both these documents treat validity as a unitary concept that is supported by a variety of evidence. However, The APA Standards and SIOP Principles has documented validity to be the unitary concept that is supported by a variety of evidence (see issue 4 of the 2009 volume and issue 3 of the 2010 volume of Industrial and Organizational Psychology: Perspectives on Science and Practice, respectively). Assessing individuals The final aspect of Industrial & Organizational Assessment is assessing individuals. The analysis includes a broad variety of assessment procedures. Many detailed tools help narrow down the method and result of assessment, including psychological testing, biographical information, interviews, work sampling, surveys, onboarding and computer-based assessment. Areas of assessment The four main areas of I/O Psychology highlight—Jobs, Work, Performance, and People. Looking at each category gives insight into how Industrial & Organizational Assessment truly works, and what is necessary to complete each step of the process. These four categories can be further broken down. Job analysis A Job Analysis is the process through which one gains an understanding of the activities, goals, and requirements demanded by a work assignment. Job analysis constitutes the preceding step of every application of psychology to human resource management including, but not limited to, the development of personnel selection, training, performance evaluation, job design, deployment, and compensation systems. Types of Job analysis =The Position Analysis Questionnaire= The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) developed by McCormick, Jeanneret, and Mecham (1972) is a structured job analysis instrument to measure job characteristics and relate them to human characteristics. It consists of 195 job elements that represent human behavior involved in work activities”.A.P.A. Home page (login required). Retrieved September 11, 2015. The items that fall into five categories:Assessment and Selection. OMP.GOV. Retrieved September 11, 2015. # Information input (where and how the worker gets information) # Mental processes (reasoning and other processes that workers use) # Work output (physical activities and tools used on the job) # Relationships with other persons # Job context (the physical and social contexts of work) PAQ researchers have aggregated PAQ data for hundreds of jobs; that database are maintained by Purdue University. Many research exists on the PAQ; it has yielded reasonably good reliability estimates and has been linked to several assessment tools”. Job seekers and employers answer questions on form outlining skills, abilities and knowledge needed to perform the job. Responses are calculated and a composite job requirement statement is produced. In a study of the comparative of 4 job analysis methods, PAQ method is structured to allow for easy quantification. The study also indicated it was closest and compatible to receive important information about an applicant The format of this method include in both data collection and computer analysis and can yield results much faster than the other methods. It has been shown to be extremely reliable, results usually replicate on a second administration. Because PAQ is worker oriented, it does not qualify if work is actually getting done on the job. Task differences on the job is not picked up because PAQ primarily focus on behaviors. =Occupational Analysis Inventory= The Occupational Analysis Inventory (OAI) contains 617 \\"work elements.\\" It was designed to yield more specific job information than other multi-job questionnaires such as the PAQ while still capturing work requirements for virtually all occupations. The major categories of items are five-fold: # Information Received # Mental Activities # Work Behavior # Work Goals # Work Context OAI respondents rate each job element on one of four rating scales: part-of-job, extent, applicability, or a special scale designed for the element. The OAI has been used to gather information on 1,400 jobs selected to represent five major occupational categories. Reliabilities obtained with the OAI have been moderate, somewhat lower than those achieved with the PAQ”. =Functional job analysis= Job analysis as a management technique was developed around 1900. It became one of the tools by which managers understood and directed organizationPAQ Services Job Analysis. Retrieved September, 2015. the website’s findings state, “Beginning in the 1940s, functional job analysis (FJA) was used by U.S. Employment Service job analysts to classify jobs for the DOT (Fine & Wiley, 1971). The most recent version of FJA uses seven scales to describe what workers do in jobs: # Things # Data # People # Worker Instructions # Reasoning # Math # Language Each scale has several levels that are anchored with specific behavioral statements and illustrative tasks. Like other job analysis instruments, FJA is a methodology for collecting job information. While it was used for many years as a part of the DOT, the Department of Labor is replacing the DOT with O*NET and will not be using FJA in O*NET. There is no current database of jobs (other than the DOT) containing FJA data for jobs in the national economy”. Goal of Individual Assessment Methods Organizations aim to reach their goals, for the goal of individual assessment the most important attribute is to collect as much information from individuals aiming to work in a common company. They are collectivities rather than individuals because achieving the goals requires the efforts (work) of a number of people (workers). The point at which the work and the worker come together is called a job. The company and the Industrial and organization psychologist need to obtain a lot of information. Some of the information they need to find out is: * What does or should the person do? * What knowledge, skill, and abilities does it take to perform this job? * What is the result of the person performing the job? * How does this job fit in with other jobs in the organization? * What is the job’s contribution toward the organization’s goals?

Some typical scenarios this would apply to include, or example, a surveyor doing social research conducts an interview with a participant, or a researcher for a clinical trial asks for a blood sample from a participant to see if there is a relationship between something which can be measured in blood and a person's health. In both cases, the ideal outcome is that any participant can join the study and neither the researcher nor the study design nor the publication of the study results would ever identify any participant in the study. People decide to participate in research for any number of different reasons, such as a personal interest, a desire to promote research which benefits their community, or for other reasons. Various guidelines for human subject research protect study participants who choose to participate in research, and the international consensus is that the rights of people who participate in studies are best protected when the study participant can trust that researchers will not connect the identities of study participants with their input into the study. Many study participants have experienced problems when their privacy was not upheld after participating in research. Sometimes privacy is not kept because of insufficient study protection, but also sometimes it is because of unanticipated problems with the study design which inadvertently compromise privacy. The privacy of research participants is typically protected by the research organizer, but the institutional review board is a designated overseer which monitors the organizer to provide protection to study participants. Information privacy Researchers publish data that they get from participants. To preserve participants' privacy, the data goes through a process to de-identify it. The goal of such a process would be to remove protected health information which could be used to connect a study participant to their contribution to a research project so that the participants will not suffer from data re-identification. Privacy attacks A privacy attack is the exploitation of an opportunity for someone to identify a study participant based on public research data. The way that this might work is that researchers collect data, including confidential identifying data, from study participants. This produces an identified dataset. Before the data is sent for research processing, it is \\"de- identified\\", which means that personally identifying data is removed from the dataset. Ideally, this means that the dataset alone could not be used to identify a participant. In some cases, the researchers simply misjudge the information in a de-identified dataset and actually it is identifying, or perhaps the advent of new technology makes the data identifying. In other cases, the published de-identified data can be cross-referenced with other data sets, and by finding matches between an identified dataset and the de- identified data set, participants in the de-identified set may be revealed. This is particularly the case with medical research data because traditional data anonymization techniques designed for numerical data are not as effective for the nonnumerical data contained in medical data, such as rare diagnoses and personalized treatments. Thus, in cases like medical research data that contain unique nonnumerical data, only removing identifying numerical features, such as age and social security number, may not be enough to mitigate privacy attacks. Risk mitigation The ideal situation from the research perspective is the free sharing of data. Since privacy for research participants is a priority, though, various proposals for protecting participants have been made for different purposes. Replacing the real data with synthetic data allows the researchers to show data which gives a conclusion equivalent to the one drawn by the researchers, but the data may have problems such as being unfit for repurposing for other research. Other strategies include \\"noise addition\\" by making random value changes or \\"data swapping\\" by exchanging values across entries. Still another approach is to separate the identifiable variables in the data from the rest, aggregate the identifiable variables and reattach them with the rest of the data. This principle has been used successfully in creating maps of diabetes in Australia http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1753-6405.12262/full and the United Kingdom using confidential General Practice clinic data. Biobank privacy A biobank is a place where human biological specimens are kept for research, and often where genomics data is paired with phenotype data and personally- identifying data. For many reasons, biobank research has created new controversies, perspectives, and challenges for satisfying the rights of student participants and the needs of the researchers to access resources for their work. One problem is that if even a small percentage of genetic information is available, that information can be used to uniquely identify the individual from which it came. Studies have shown that a determination of whether an individual participated in a study can be made even from reporting of aggregate data. Negative consequences When research participants have their identities revealed they may face various problems. Concerns include facing genetic discrimination from an insurance company or employer. Respondents in the United States have expressed a desire to have their research data to be restricted from access by law enforcement agencies and would want to prevent a connection between study participation and legal consequences of the same. Another fear study participants have is about the research revealing private personal practices which a person may not want to discuss, such as a medical history which includes a sexually transmitted disease, substance abuse, psychiatric treatment, or an elective abortion. In the case of genomic studies on families, genetic screening may reveal that paternity is different from what had been supposed. For no particular reason, some people may find that if their private information becomes disclosed because of research participation, they may feel invaded and find the entire system distasteful. An Australian study investigating the violence, bullying, and harassment towards LGBTIQ people revealed that some of the participants, who were all members of the LGBTIQ community, had been subjected to levels of violence that would constitute a crime. However, the participants were reluctant to report their victimization to the police. This meant that the researchers were placed in a position where they could report a crime to the police. However, ethical practices meant that they were obliged to respect the privacy and wishes of the participants and so they could not do so.

Myrdal used the term to describe: ::... all the various types of social indiscipline which manifest themselves by deficiencies in legislation and, in particular, law observance and enforcement, a widespread disobedience by public officials and, often, their collusion with powerful persons and groups ... whose conduct they should regulate. Within the concept of the soft states belongs also corruption (Myrdal, (1970), p 208). For Myrdal a major causal factor was colonial powers' destruction of many of the traditional centers of local power and influence and failure to create viable alternatives. Coupled with this was the development of an attitude of disobedience to any authority which was central to the nationalist politics resistance. This attitude persisted after independence. Such soft states are seen as unlikely to capable of imposing the right development policies and would be unwilling to act against corruption at all levels.Myrdal, G., (1968), Asian Drama.

London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Soft state paradigm According to the soft state paradigm, there are two types of statehood: empirical and juridical, or soft. The state in its empirical sense is defined and determined by its demonstrable capacity in such matters as competitive pressures of the classical states-system (for example, was the respect and recognition accorded by other governments) and the development of armed forces, courts and magistrates, and police forces. This type of state, originating in competitive Europe, was built by under strong pressures for disintegration, both domestic and international. This empirical state is also found in North America, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. The juridical state is the novel-moral- legal foundation of the collaborative states-system that has emerged in many parts of the ex-colonial world, particularly tropical Africa; it lacks the essentials of statehood, sovereignty is guaranteed by the world community of states as embodied in the United Nations.

The Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen (\\"Market Church of Our Dear Lady\\") is a church in the centre of the city of Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It was built between 1529 and 1554 and is the most recent of the city's medieval churches. In German, its official name is shortened to Liebfrauenkirche but it is also referred to as Marienkirche (St. Mary's Church) and the Marktkirche (Market Church). The church replaced two former churches in the market area, their towers were integrated into the new building. The Market Church is considered one of the most important buildings of the late Gothic period in central Germany. Its four towers, together with the Red Tower, are the landmark of the city, hence its nickname \\"Stadt der fünf Türme\\" (City of the Five Towers). Justus Jonas introduced the Reformation into Halle, and his friend Martin Luther preached in the church. George Frideric Handel was baptized here and received his first organ lessons. Johann Sebastian Bach inspected the new organ, and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach was an organist. The beginnings of both pietism and Enlightenment were connected to the church. Little damaged in World War II, the church is today a historic protected monument. History The Market Church was built between 1529 and 1554 at the location of two predecessors, St. Gertrude and St. Mary. The Church of St. Gertrude to the west dated from 11th century and was the church of the salt makers in the center of Halle on the Hallmarkt, the salt market. The St. Mary's Church to the east dated from the 12th century and had been the parish church of the merchants and tradesmen of this mining town on the Marktplatz, the market square. Albert of Brandenburg in his study (1526), by Lucas Cranach the Elder Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Archbishop of Magdeburg and Elector of Mainz, needed a prestigious church that met his expectations at a central location in his Residenz town. Albrecht, who feared for his peace of mind in the heaven, had collected more than 8,100 relics and 42 holy skeletons which needed to be stored. These precious treasures known as \\"Hallesches Heilthum\\" and indirectly related to the sale of indulgences had triggered the Reformation a few years before. Notably on 31 October 1517 Martin Luther posted his famous 95 Theses, in which he condemned the trade with indulgences and sent a copy to his cardinal Albrecht, who in turn sent it to Pope Leo X. Then the cardinal and the Roman Catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of the Reformation by holding far grander masses and services in a new church dedicated solely to Saint Mary. On Whit Monday, 17 May 1529, representatives of the clergy, the city council and church pastors gathered on the market square and decided, after extensive consultation, to demolish the existing parish churches, only keeping their towers, and connect the two (blue) western towers to those on the eastern side by means of a new nave. It was also decided to close the two cemeteries surrounding the churches. A new burial site was chosen – the Martinsberg, a hill outside the town – and the Stadtgottesacker cemetery was laid out. This cemetery with 94 arches, designed by Nickel Hoffman, is a masterpiece of the Renaissance.  Construction history  From 1529 to 1530 the old nave of St. Gertrude was demolished. What remained were the Blue Towers dating from around 1400, with their spires, which had been added in 1507 and 1513. On the east side the Watchmen's Towers (Hausmanntürme) of St. Mary's, with Late Romanesque bases and Renaissance upper stories, dating from 1551 to 1554, were linked by a bridge for the watchmen, who in case of fire and danger alerted the inhabitants by the ringing of the bells. Today, the watchman's room (Hausmannsstube) can be viewed on certain occasions. Martin Luther, portrait by Lucas Cranach the Elder, 1529 Justus Jonas in the Cranach family register, 1543 The new church built between the two pairs of towers is the last great hall church of the Upper Saxon Gothic style and is one of the outstanding architectural works of its days in Central Germany. It was designed by the town's master builder (Ratsbaumeister), Caspar Krafft. After his death in 1540 his successor, Nickel Hoffmann, took over the construction of the western end of the hall and the matroneum. The church was built in two phases, the first from 1530 to 1539 and, after a short interruption, the second from 1542 to 1554.  Subsequent history  The Market Church, which had been built to defend against the spread of Reformation sympathies, was the very spot where Justus Jonas officially introduced the Reformation into Halle with his Good Friday address in 1541. The service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air, because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave. Jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people the church was overfilled. Cardinal Albert left the town for good, after the estates (Stände) in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt mountain at the bank of Jacob Fugger. Halle became Protestant and in 1542 Jonas was appointed as priest to St. Mary's and in 1544 bishop over the city. In 1545 and 1546 Luther preached three times in the church, staying with his friend Jonas during Christmas. In 1546 Luther died and his body lay in repose in Halle during his funeral procession from Eisleben to Wittenberg. In the same year Jonas was banished by Maurice, Elector of Saxony and left the city. In 1625, during the Thirty Years War, the (converted) Wallenstein invaded the city; the inhabitants paid him almost a million Gulden a year for not housing his soldiers. When Samuel Scheidt lost his job because of Wallenstein, he was appointed in 1628 as musical director over three churches in Halle, including the Market Church. Handel and the Bach family The small organ The main organ On 24 February 1685, Handel was baptized in the Market Church. The small organ above the altar, built between 1663 and 1664, a replacement for an earlier model and not replaced since, is one of the oldest in Central Germany; the young Handel received his first organ lessons from Friedrich Zachau, who was in service since 1684. In 1713 Johann Sebastian Bach was offered a post when he advised the authorities during a renovation by Christoph Cuntzius of the main organ in the west gallery. Bach turned the job down to stay in Weimar. Johann Kuhnau, Christian Friedrich Rolle and Bach played when it was inaugurated in 1716. The successor of Zachow, Gottfried Kirchhoff, a pupil of Pachelbel, had composed two cantatas for the occasion. Musicologists debate whether Bach's earliest extant Christmas cantata Christen, ätzet diesen Tag, BWV 63, with two choruses and two duets, but no arias or chorale, on text probably written by the Halle theologian J.M. Heineccius was premiered here in 1713 or in 1715, or if it was performed for the bicentennial of the Reformation in 1717. From 1746 to 1764 his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach worked as an organist in the Market Church. In 1749 the Hallensian Bach, as he is sometimes referred to, had a dispute with his Kantor, Johann Gottfried Mittag, \\"who had misappropriated money due to Bach\\". In 1753 he made his first documented attempt to find another post, and thereafter made several others. W.F. Bach had at least two pupils, Friedrich Wilhelm Rust and Johann Samuel Petri. In June 1764, Friedemann left the job in Halle without any employment secured elsewhere. In 1768 he re-applied for his old job in Halle, without success. In or around 1770 he moved to Braunschweig and applied as a church organist. Pietism vs Early Enlightenment Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten, minister In 1728 the 22-year-old Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten, a Hallensian Pietist and bibliophile, was appointed as minister of the church. In 1734 he became professor in theology and in 1748 rector of the Halle University. At the end of his life he translated encyclopedic articles or biographies from English into German, for example Samlung von merkwürdigen Lebensbeschreibungen grösten Theils aus der Britannischen Biographie (Collection of remarkable descriptions of lives mostly from Britain biography), published in 1757. At the end of the 17th century two important movements started in Halle which influenced many people during the 18th century: pietism and radical Enlightenment. These two movements can not be seen separately and influenced each other, but it came to a debate on grace or virtue between theologians and philosophers of the Friedrich's Universität, which was located next to the Market Church in the former Weigh house. On 12 July 1723 Christian Wolff, a professor in philosophy and mathematics, held a lecture for students and the magistrates at the end of his term as a rector. His subject was practical Chinese philosophy, and he compared, based on a book by the Belgian missionary François Noël (1651–1729), Moses, Christ and Mohammed with Confucius. According to Voltaire professor August Hermann Francke had been teaching in an empty classroom but Wolff attracted with his lectures around 1,000 students from all over. In the following up Wolff was accused by Francke of fatalism and atheism. In November he had to leave the city within 48 hours; his successors were Joachim Lange, a pietist, and his son. According to Jonathan I. Israel \\"the conflict became one of the most significant cultural confrontations of the eighteenth century and perhaps the most important of the Enlightenment in Central Europe and the Baltic countries before the French Revolution.\\" What happened in Halle should not be seen as an isolated case, but as trendy and fashionable. Around 1720 Chinese porcelain was loaded in enormous quantities to Europe. In the Albrechtsburg the Meissen porcelain manufactory had been started up to copy it and Chinoiserie was popular among artists and buyers. In 1726 Wolff published his Discours, in which he again mentioned the importance of listening to music put on pregnant Chinese women, and had reworded some on Moses. In 1736 a research was started to evaluate the case and in 1740 (or 1743) Wolff was reappointed by the philosopher-king Frederick the Great. It is possible the eminent professor, in between a member of the Royal Society and the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, introduced Wilhelm Friedemann Bach to the Prussian court. In 1840 and 1841 the layout of the altar area was changed based on plans by Wilhelm August Stapel and Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The historical artist, Julius Hübner painted a new altarpiece of the Sermon on the Mount with the text Schaut die Lilien (\\"Consider the lilies\\" or \\"Look at the lilies\\"). After World War II tectonic fault, called the Halle Marketplace fault. Eastside from the market The Market Church has not undergone any permanent changes to its external and internal appearance during its history. During the air raid on the centre of Halle shortly before the end of the war on 31 March 1945 it was, however, badly damaged. One bomb penetrated between the northern Watchmen's Tower and the nave (Langschiff) and tore one of the two pillars of the northern colonnade away, whereby part of the vaulted ceiling collapsed. That damaged the bronze font by Meister Ludolf. As a result of the artillery bombardment on 16 April 1945 the tracery window on the west front behind the organ was shattered, and the church roof and spires of the Watchmen's Towers damaged. The restoration work lasted from January 1946 to the beginning of 1948. Major repairs had to begin in 1967, when the entire interior and furnishings were badly damaged by a burst district heating pipe, which was part of the church heating system. The subsequent repair in the years from 1968 to 1983 was one of the biggest monument maintenance and restoration projects of the East German period. The work was conducted under the direction of the Institute for the Preservation of Historic Monuments. (Institut für Denkmalpflege). It was decided to restore, as far as possible, its appearance in the 16th century. For example, even the original polyptych was returned to its old spot and Hübner's altarpiece was brought out of the sacristy and displayed behind it. Marian Library The Market Church itself houses a library, the Marian Library (Marienbibliothek), which is considered to be one of the oldest and largest church libraries in Germany, founded in 1552 by Sebastian Boetius, senior pastor of the church. Until the establishment of the Friedrich's Universität in 1694, by August Hermann Francke with the aid of Christian Thomasius and Philipp Jakob Spener – the lectures were not held in Latin, but in German – it was the only public (or non-private) academic library in the city. Students were encouraged to visit this library.  Museum  In memory of the Reformation and Martin Luther, a small Luther Museum was established in the basement of the Blue Towers in May 2006. Amongst the objects on display are the death mask made of him on 19 February 1546 and impressions of his hands.

The Lockman Hole is an area of the sky in which minimal amounts of neutral hydrogen gas are observed. Clouds of neutral hydrogen glow faintly with infrared light and obscure distant views at extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray wavelengths. They interfere with observations at those wavelengths in nearly all other directions since they are common in our galaxy. So the Lockman Hole serves as a relatively clear window on distant objects, which makes it an attractive area of the sky for observational astronomy surveys. It is located near the pointer stars of the Big Dipper in the constellation Ursa Major and is about 15 square degrees in size. It is named after its discoverer, astronomer Jay Lockman. Location The Lockman Hole is located at about RA 10h 45m, Dec. +58° and is defined by a region of low neutral hydrogen gas and dust column density. Column density is a commonly used measure in astronomy for the quantity of a given chemical element or molecule in a certain direction. In this region, the typical column density of neutral hydrogen is NH = 0.6 x 1020 cm−2. This column density is moderately lower than typical values near the galactic poles, where NH \\\\sim 1020 cm−2, and H I column densities of NH > 1021 cm−2 are common at low galactic latitudes and towards H I clouds. The region around B1950.0 RA Dec has a minimum NH of 4.5 x 1019 cm−2. There is a diffuse cloud covering half of the field. The Lockman Hole East is a subregion of the Lockman Hole centered at J2000.0 RA Dec . The Lockman Hole North-west (LHNW) is a region that appears about as wide as the moon centered at J2000.0 RA Dec ., with a column density of NH = 5.72 x 1019 cm−2. Hydrogen gas absorption and emission Clouds of neutral hydrogen are ubiquitous in the Milky Way galaxy, and effectively absorb photons that are energetic enough to ionize hydrogen, which requires an energy of 13.6 electron volts (in the extreme ultraviolet range). Even the relatively small amounts of hydrogen in the Lockman Hole absorb most radiation at and just above energies of 13.6 electron volts, but even so it transmits extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray radiation from extragalactic objects to a greater degree than other areas of the sky. Neutral hydrogen is also associated with diffuse emission at infrared wavelengths that can confuse observations of faint infrared sources. Observations The relatively clear field of view offered by the Lockman Hole has allowed its use to view extremely distant regions of the universe. Observations by the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) instrument aboard the Herschel Space Telescope of the Lockman Hole have imaged thousands of extremely distant galaxies that appear as they did 10–12 billion years ago. This field of view also contains hundreds of astronomical X-ray sources, some of them supermassive black holes. The Chandra X-ray Observatory and ROSAT have been used to study X-ray sources from the Lockman Hole. Some 75 X-ray sources are observed with the PSPC of ROSAT. Detailed X-ray spectral analysis has been performed on 123 X-ray sources in the Lockman Hole using XMM-Newton. The diffuse X-ray background (XRB) has also been studied in the area. Active galactic nuclei have also been studied in the area, for example MBC2005.

This place has a good collection of roses of various varieties set by the sides of water fountains. Gulab Bari is the maqbara (Mausoleum) of Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula, the third Nawab of Oudh (now faizabad) in the campus. This monument has declared to be of National Importance under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958 as updated by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. Further under Sub-section 20 (a) and 20 (b) of Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Monuments and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act, 2010. Gulab Bari is surrounded by an enclosure wall, built of Lakhauri bricks lime plastered and decorated with plaster mouldings. The enclosure contains the tomb of Shuja-ud-daula along with mosque Imambara, Shahi Hammam, Baradari and a well approached through triple-arched gateways. The tomb of Shuja-ud-daula (1753–1775) was constructed by himself during his lifetime which is approached through an imposing gateway. The central chamber contains the cenotaph which houses the graves of Nawab Shuja- ud-daula and his mother. The tomb proper stands in the centre of a Charbagh Garden accompanied by fountains and shallow water channels. The square double- storeyed structure of the mausoleum has an arched verandah on each side, while its upper storey has a three arched façade adorned by minarets on the corners. The dome of the central chamber is crowned by inverted lotus and metal finial. Gulab Bari is not only a spot that needs to be visited; it is a place of worship and various cultural events. The locals treat it as a holy place. It is said that the monument is connected to a boali in Lucknow and used to be hiding place for the successors of the Nawab Shuja-ud-daula. The fragrance of roses in the Gulab Udyaan brought relief to the busy mind of the nawab and allowed him to work and take decisions. It might have served as soldier's cabin and a house for the servants (not the main monument but the structures around). Today Gulab Bari is though in a poor condition, it still is very important for the locals (mostly of the Muslim Community). It remained very important, remains important and will remain important only if its tourism is boosted and the people become a little more conscious about its importance. History Shuja-ud-Daula the Nawab of Awadh, with Four Sons, General Barker and other military officers The Nawabs graced Faizabad with several beautiful buildings, notable among them are the Gulab Bari, Moti Mahal and the tomb of Bahu Begum. Gulab Bari is a beautiful building of fine architecture, standing in a garden surrounded by a wall, approachable through two large gateways. Shuja-ud-Daula's wife was the well known Bahu Begum, who married the Nawab in 1743 and continued to reside in Faizabad, her residence being the Moti-Mahal. Close by at Jawaharbagh lies her Maqbara, where she was buried after her death in 1816. It is considered to be one of the finest buildings of its kind in Avadh, which was built at the cost of three lakh rupees by her chief advisor Darab Ali Khan. A fine view of the city is obtainable from top of the begum's tomb. Bahu Begum was a woman of great distinction and rank, bearing dignity. Most of the Muslim buildings of Faizabad are attributed to her. From the date of Bahu Begum's death in 1815 till the annexation of Avadh, the city of Faizabad gradually fell into decay. The glory of Faizabad finally eclipsed with the shifting of capital from Faizabad to Lucknow by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. Shuja-ud-daula, the Nawab of Awadh, made Faizabad the capital of Awadh. During his reign Faizabad attained prosperity, which it never saw again. He constructed very huge & magnificent buildings in the city. Unique features of these buildings are their assimilative architectural designs. This magnificent building is the mausoleum of Nawab Shuja-ud-daula which is surrounded by a well laid out rose garden. The entire complex is enclosed by a boundary wall with two large gates to gain access. The tomb of Shuja-ud-daula (1753–1775) was constructed by himself during his lifetime which is approached through an imposing gateway. The central chamber contains the cenotaph which houses the graves of Nawab Shuja-ud-daula and his mother. The tomb proper stands in the centre of a Charbagh Garden accompanied by fountains and shallow water channels. The square double-storeyed structure of the mausoleum has an arched verandah on each side, while its upper storey has a three arched façade adorned by minarets on the corners.

Their style blends influences from hardcore punk, heavy metal and post-rock. They signed to Deathwish Inc. in 2010, and released their debut album Early Frost in 2013. History Heiress was founded in Seattle, Washington in 2006 by guitarist Wes Reed. Reed originally planned being the only member of Heiress with different people contributing vocals. However, Reed recruited Adam Paysse, the co-founder of Rome Plow Records, who both found a drummer and a bassist, and recorded a demo with producer Ben Verellen (Harkonen, Helms Alee). In December 2008, John Pettibone, formerly of many Seattle-area bands including Himsa and Undertow, took over Paysse's place as lead vocalist. Pettibone's previous band Himsa disbanded because the members were tired of touring. With this lineup, Heiress recorded a five-song self-titled EP that was self-released by the band in 2009. In 2010, Heiress signed to Deathwish Inc., an independent hardcore punk record label that was co-founded by Jacob Bannon of Converge. The group's first release through the label was a split 7\\" with Narrows. Guitarist Josh Freer joined the band and performed on this release temporarily replacing Jeremy McAllister. In mid-2011, Jack Endino (Nirvana, Mudhoney, Murder City Devils) produced and engineered 17 new Heiress tracks at Soundhouse Studios. Endino also remixed two previously recorded Heiress songs. Deathwish released two of the songs from these sessions, \\"Naysayer\\" and \\"Just Throats,\\" as a 7\\" vinyl single in 2012. The single featured artwork by Demian Johnston, who previously played with Pettibone in Undertow and Nineironspitfire, and was positively received by Alternative Press. Ten of the remaining tracks from this session became Heiress' full- length debut album titled Early Frost. In October 2011, Early Frost was expected to be released in 2012. However, Deathwish did not end up releasing the album until 2013 due to pressing plant delays. Heiress released its second studio album Of Great Sorrow on February 10, 2015 through The Mylene Sheath — pushed back four months from its originally projected November 18, 2014 release date. The album was recorded by Tad Doyle of the Seattle-based band Tad and mastered by Chris Hanzsek (Soundgarden, Melvins) with artwork by Demian Johnston. Before the release of Of Great Sorrow, Heiress had already begun working on its third studio album with Matt Bayles (Botch, Isis, Mastodon) for a tentative 2015 release. The band released its third studio album Made Wrong on March 18, 2016 through The Mylene Sheath.

Life After stealing money collected for the children's Christmas party in 1889, Ahlwardt was fired from his job as a primary school principal. He blamed his financial difficulties on Jewish money-lenders and wrote a book claiming the German government was in the pay of the Jewish banker, Gerson von Bleichröder. He was jailed for four months when it came to light that the documents he used to support the claim had been written by Ahlwardt himself. In 1892, Ahlwardt accused arms manufacturer Ludwig Loewe & Co. of being in a Jewish-French conspiracy to sell defective rifles to the German army in order to weaken the country militarily and was sentenced to five months' imprisonment for this unfounded defamation but was not jailed because by this time he had been elected to the Reichstag. He had run in a by-election for a very rural Brandenberg district seat. World agriculture prices were depressed at the time and he had told this farming community that their troubles were due to the Jews. In the Reichstag he described Jews as \\"predators\\" and \\"cholera bacilli\\" that should be exterminated. The popularity of Ahlwardt and another antisemite Reichstag deputy, Otto Böckel, in conservative rural electorates prompted the German Conservative Party to add an antisemitic plank to their 1892 Tivoli Congress platform. Ahlwardt's violent rhetoric alienated even other antisemitic politicians. In 1895, Ahlwardt was expelled from the German Social Reform Party and, with Otto Böckel, founded the Antisemitic People's Party (Antisemitische Volkspartei). He lost his seat in the 1903 Reichstag election and withdrew from politics. He visited the United States and on returning to Germany began campaigning against Freemasonry. He was imprisoned again in 1909, this time for blackmail, and in 1914 Ahlwardt died in a traffic accident in Leipzig at the age of 67. During his visit to the United States, he went to New York and made a speech against Jews. A popular story told by the New York Times in 1940 has it that when he asked for police protection, the police that were assigned to guard him were all Jews. This is not supported by news articles of the time and in fact the names of officers printed during his 1895 visit are Anglo or Irish names not generally used by Jews such as Cartright and O'Brien. However, Theodore Roosevelt, who was the Police Commissioner at the time, confirms in his autobiography that he deliberately assigned Jewish police to protect Ahlwardt, in order to ridicule him.Theodore Roosevelt: an Autobiography Chapter VI.

It is set in a period of roughly 24 hours from the 6 May 2010—the date of the British general election and the Flash Crash. It follows the interactions of a group of employees at Hoffmann Investment Technologies, a fictional hedge fund operating in Geneva. Plot The story begins as Physicist Dr. Alexander Hoffmann, an American expat living in Switzerland, and the founder of his eponymous hedge fund, receives a first edition copy of The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Hoffmann is mystified that the book's subject relates to his theory on fear, and even more that there is no indication of who sent it. That night, Hoffmann is attacked in his home by an unknown assailant. The police inspector, Leclerc is skeptical about the validity of Hoffmann's story. The next morning he proceeds to his company, where his charismatic English CEO, Hugo Quarry, is pitching for a renewed investment from the firm's potential and existing clients. They seek to utilise Hoffmann's genius with algorithms into a system, called VIXAL-4, which can provide sufficient data on the markets to generate successful hedges, despite protests from the company's Chief Risk Officer Ganapathi Rajamani. Hoffmann's English wife Gabrielle is approached by Leclerc at her art gallery. Leclerc informs her that when Hoffmann was at CERN, he suffered a nervous breakdown. Later Gabrielle confronts Hoffmann, who brushes it of as being nothing important. Suddenly it is announced that all of Gabrielle's artwork has sold to an anonymous collector. Gabrielle suspects that Hoffmann is behind it and storms off. Hoffmann and Quarry succeed in bring in the massive investments. When asked to give a speech, Hoffmann suddenly flees the restaurant. Hoffmann eventually tracks down the assailant to a hotel room where Karp the assailant, attacks him. In the struggle Karp's neck breaks. Hoffmann falsifies the crime scene to make it look like a suicide. Forensics inform Leclerc, and he deduces that Hoffmann killed him. Over the course of the business day the situation becomes unstable, with VIXAL assuming a level of risk considered unsustainable by the human staff. Meanwhile, Quarry fires Rajamani for insubordination. Hoffmann discovers that a hacker has stolen his medical records. Upon returning to his company, Hoffmann finds out that someone posing as him ordered his head of security to place surveillance cameras all over the company and his home. During the confrontation Quarry discovers that the deed to the building they rent is in Hoffmann's name. It is also revealed that a warehouse deep in an industrial sector is also owned by Hoffmann. Hoffmann vows to shut down VIXAL once and for all, as well as to leave the future of the company in the hands of Quarry. Rajamani confronts the two and threatens to report the company's illegal activities, and leaves. Hoffmann chases after him only for him to plunge down an elevator shaft. Hoffmann deduces that VIXAL's AI has become hostile. He rushes to destroy warehouse, which contains unauthorized hardware. Leclerc arrives with his arrest squad only to find Rajamani's corpse, further implicating Hoffmann as a murderer. Hoffmann buys 100 liters of gasoline, with the plan of killing himself and taking VIXAL with him. As the Flash Crash occurs, Hoffmann razes the warehouse. Hoffmann is talked out of suicide by Gabrielle and Quarry. Hoffmann is badly injured and hospitalized. Quarry is told that VIXAL is still trading even with its hardware destroyed. Also VIXAL made a huge profit from the crash. Quarry also decides to allow the AI to take control of the company. Then VIXAL proclaims itself \\"alive\\".

Looking east from where a signal bridge at the east end of Greendell Siding will be located, the edge of the borrow pit is visible to the right. Andover Station will be built at the far end of the Fill, where the right-of-way begins to curve to the right, about 3 miles away. The Pequest Fill is a large railroad embankment on the Lackawanna Cut-Off in northwestern New Jersey, touted at its 1911 completion as the largest railroad fill in the world. Thought to have been the brainchild of Lackawanna Railroad president William Truesdale, the Pequest Fill was one of several remarkable features of the Lackawanna Cut-Off, a project that aimed to reduce the length, grades, and curvature of the railroad's main line over the hilly terrain between Port Morris, New Jersey, and the Delaware Water Gap. During planning, Truesdale rejected 13 prospective routes that skirted the Pequest Valley in favor of a bold, costly, yet operationally superior route across it. In order to maintain a more or less level grade across the valley, a fill of enormous proportions would be required to connect Andover and Green Township.The Lackawanna Railroad in Northwest New Jersey, Larry Lowenthal and William T. Greenberg, Jr., Tri-State Railway Historical Society, Inc., 1987. Planning for the route continued through 1906; the final survey map for the line was completed on September 1, allowing the railroad to proceed with eminent domain and hire contractors. The 28.5-mile (46-km) Cut-Off project was divided among seven contractors. Whether by design or happenstance, the responsibility for building the Pequest Fill was divided roughly in half between David W. Flickwir to the east and Walter H. Gahagan to the west. The most familiar view of the Pequest Fill to those who travel northwest New Jersey would be where US Route 206 passes under it in Andover, New Jersey. Looking north, the new Andover Station on the Cut-Off will be about a half-mile to the right (east). Construction on the Cut-Off began August 1, 1908. The foundation for the three-mile (4.8 km) Pequest Fill was constructed of 6.625 million cubic yards of fill material, far more than could be provided by classic cut-and-fill techniques. (These require a relatively even balance between the amount of dirt and rock material that is removed from an area of the right-of-way to provide a cut through a hill and the needs of a nearby fill.) So the railroad bought 760 acres of farmland and dug it out to a depth of about 20 feet (6 m). Construction wrapped up in autumn 1911. The Pequest Fill crosses four roadways (US Route 206 and three county roads), two railroad rights-of-way (the Sussex Branch and the Lehigh & Hudson River Railway), and one river (the Pequest River). There are no overhead bridges or grade crossings. The east end of Greendell Siding continued onto the Pequest Fill for a short distance; otherwise, the railroad was two tracks wide on the fill. The Cut-Off saw rail service between 1911 (when the Lackawanna Cut-Off opened) to 1979 (when Conrail discontinued rail service). In between, the Lackawanna Railroad operated trains over the Pequest Fill for 49 years; the Erie Lackawanna Railroad for 16 years; and Conrail for three years. After discontinuing service, Conrail sought abandonment of the line and eventually removed the tracks in 1984. In 1985, the Cut-Off was sold to a land developer who proposed to use the entire Pequest Fill for the now- defunct Westway Project in New York City. That never occurred; by 2001, the entire Cut-Off had been acquired by the State of New Jersey. By 2011, NJ Transit had received approval to begin construction on relaying track between Port Morris Junction and Andover. As of 2019, this project continues and is slated to open for rail service no earlier than 2021. However, there is no funding and no projected completion date for service west of Andover, over the Pequest Fill.

(2008). Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives. pp. 111, 119–126. St. Martin's Press first coined the term in 2009, when they held a special call for \\"...fiction similar to YA that can be published and marketed as adult—a sort of an 'older YA' or 'new adult'\\". New adult fiction tends to focus on issues such as leaving home, developing sexuality, and negotiating education and career choices. The genre has gained popularity rapidly over the last few years, particularly through books by self-published bestselling authors like Jennifer L. Armentrout, Cora Carmack, Colleen Hoover, Anna Todd and Jamie McGuire. The genre was originally faced with criticism, as some viewed it as a marketing scheme, while others claimed the readership was not there to publish the material. In contrast, others claimed that the term was necessary; a publicist for HarperCollins described it as \\"a convenient label because it allows parents and bookstores and interested readers to know what is inside\\". Examples of books in the new adult genre include Sarah J. Maas' A Court of Thorns and Roses and Throne of Glass, Jennifer L. Armentrout's Wait For You, Jamie McGuire's Beautiful Disaster, Colleen Hoover's Slammed, Cora Carmack's Losing It, Kendall Ryan's The Impact of You and Casey McQuiston's Red, White & Royal Blue. Marketing This category is intended to be marketed to post-adolescents and young-adults ages 18 to 30. This age group is considered to be the lucrative \\"cross-over\\" category of young-adult titles that appeal to both the young-adult market and to an adult audience. Publishers of young-adult fiction now favor this category as it encompasses a far broader audience. The chief features that distinguish the new-adult fiction category from young adult fiction are the perspective of the young protagonist and the scope of the protagonist's life experience. Perspective is gained as childhood innocence fades and life experience is gained, which brings insight. It is this insight which is lacking in traditional young-adult fiction. The other main differences are characters' ages and the settings. YA does not usually include main characters over age 18 or in college, but these characters are featured in new adult books. New adult can best be described as the age category after young adult. Themes and issues New adult literature touches upon many themes and issues to reach the readership that falls in between the categories of young adult and adult fiction. Many themes covered in young adult fiction such as identity, sexuality, depression, suicide, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, familial struggles, bullyingyoung adult fiction are also covered in new adult fiction, but the various issues that are dealt with in the category hold it separate. Some common examples of issues include first jobs, starting college, wedding engagements and marriage, starting new families, friendships post-high school, military enlistment, financial independence, living away from home for the first time, empowerment, loss of innocence, and fear of failure. This category focuses heavily on life after an individual has become of legal age, and how one deals with the new beginnings of adulthood. Commonly, these themes and issues have been seen taking place post-high school in popular new adult fiction titles, but there are exceptions. Genre Like the fiction categories of young adult and adult, new adult fiction can combine with all genres and subgenres. Science fiction, urban fiction, horror, paranormal, dystopia, etc. are some examples. Controversies Publishing industry Many agents and large publishing houses have yet to recognize the category due to various issues. Some view the category as a marketing scheme, while others claim the readership is not there to publish the material. Therefore, authors have turned to self-publishing as a means to get their books out into the market. The success of these authors has led to many independent publishing houses and agents opening up to the category. Publishers are now publishing these books with many of the bestsellers having deals with large publishers. Sex In 2012, new adult fiction saw a rise in the romance subgenre of contemporary when self-published titles such as Slammed by Colleen Hoover, Easy by Tamarra Webber, and Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire got picked up by major publishing houses. Some believe this jump in response to the category came from the release of the popular erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, which featured a heroine in college. Since new adult fiction tackles issues such as sex and sexuality and many of the categories' successful titles deal with those same issues the category itself and the single issue of sex have been stated as synonymous, and even been called over-sexualized versions of young adult fiction. Both readers and authors of the category combat the claim by stating that the category deals with the exploration of a character's life, and that sex is not ubiquitous in new adult titles. 2009 to present Following the end of the St. Martin's Press contest, the new adult category has become increasingly popular through self-publishing. Major New York publishers are taking self- published authors of these titles and acquiring them for mass market sales. Some authors include: *Cora Carmack for Losing It *Kathy Clark released a new- adult genre novel in her Scandals series titled Due Dates in November, 2013 *Sylvia Day for Reflected in You * Colleen Hoover for Slammed and Point of Retreat * Jamie McGuire for Beautiful Disaster * Tammara Webber for Easy Authors Some noteworthy authors of the category include: * Jennifer L.

Rasheed, starring Prajith and Sajitha Madathil in the lead roles.The New Indian Express. 'No Malayalam films at IFF Kerala!' Adimadhyantham won a special mention award at the 59th National Film Awards. The film is yet to get a theatrical release, but received generally positive reviews in its premiere show. It was the only Malayalam film selected to compete in the 16th International Film Festival of Kerala, but was later ousted on technical grounds, and after a huge scandal, was included for a non-competition screening.Deccan Chronicle. 'It would be known for frustration, not festivity' Plot Adimadhyantham tells the story of a deaf Vedan boy from northern Kerala named Ekalavyan, who has to follow and perform some traditional tribal rituals to carry forward his family tradition in Theyyam and traditional beliefs. The boy is speech-and hearing-impaired, and his fears about death and loneliness form the main thread of its story. The boy experiences days and nights differently and has nightmares about death.  The IFFK controversy  The Adimadhyantham-IFFK controversy started off from the fact that the film was initially co-edited by an IFFK official Beena Paul Venugopal. Later the editing work was handed over to another person, for obscure reasons, and the film did not credit Beena Paul Venugopal as a co-editor either. What originated as a credit claim, later led to the expulsion of Adimadhyantham from the list of films in the competition section of the International Film Festival of Kerala, of which Beena Paul Venugopal is a managing official. This amounted to an unexpectedly huge scandal because Adimadhyantham was the only Malayalam film selected to the competition section of the 16th IFFK. The expulsion was through the direct intervention of Priyadarshan, chairman of the Chalachithra Academy, and the rejection was defended publicly by K. B. Ganesh Kumar, Minister for Cultural Affairs.The Deccan Chronicle. 'No end to Adimadhyantham controversy.' This raised a controversy and K. B. Ganesh Kumar, the Minister for Cultural Affairs, claimed that the film was rejected because, only a rough-cut version was submitted. He produced a DVD in the press conference to prove his argument, while the selection committee maintained that a finished film was, in fact, submitted to the committee and that they had seen the complete film before selecting it. This flared up the controversy and the matter was pulled to the High Court of Kerala. The court rejected the plea on technical grounds (lack of English subtitles during submission of the film, a rule never strictly followed in the preceding years). An appeal moved to the Division Bench was also rejected on the same grounds leaving an IFFK without a Malayalam film to compete.Times of India. 'HC rejects Aadimadhyantham plea again.' Later, upon flaring up of the scandal, K. B. Ganesh Kumar conceded to include the film in the non-competing category, limited to just two screenings.The Hindu. 'Sherry says no to film screening.' The left oriented cultural organization Purogamana Kala Sahitya Sangham took the issue up and waged a protest at one of the IFFK venues. The issue came up in the open forum discussion on the second day of the festival, and the delegates engaged in heated arguments with Priyadarshan. In the end, Priyadarshan apologised for the problems.The New Indian Express. 'An ugly turn to first open forum.'Madhyamam. ആദിമധ്യാന്തം: പ്രിയദര്‍ശന്‍ മാപ്പ് പറഞ്ഞു.

It was Lorde's first collection to be released by a major publisher. Lorde's poetry in Coal explored themes related to the several layers of her identity as a \\"Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet.\\"  Summary  Coal consists of five sections. While Audre Lorde presents poems that express each part of her identity, race undoubtedly plays a significant role in Coal. A major theme within the volume is Lorde's angry reaction towards racism. For Lorde, expressing anger was not destructive. Instead, Lorde transforms \\"rage at racism into triumphant self-assertion.\\" She specifically dedicates the book \\"To the People of Sun, That We May All Better Understand.\\" In addition, another significant part of the volume explores her existence as a lesbian, friend, and a former lover, specifically in the fourth section that consists of one long poem titled \\"Martha\\" that outlines the recovery of Lorde's former lover after a car accident.  Origin of the title  The volume's namesake comes from a poem in the first section titled \\"Coal\\". It is written in free- verse and first-person. The idea of an identity consisting of several layers is exemplified in this poem. One's true identity is often hidden behind several muddled layers. Lorde alludes toward this concept by her recurrent use of the dual imagery of a piece of coal and a diamond. As the speaker of the poem, Lorde begins by equating herself with a piece of coal.  Section I  The array of topics and nuances that are explored in Lorde's poems pertain to her own multifaceted-ness, signifying her status as \\"a self-styled \\"black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet.\\" The poem \\"Rites of Passage\\" shows as having a preoccupation with the male principle and with power. In it, she laments \\"their fathers are dying / whose deaths will not free them.\\" This poem, as well as \\"Father Son and Holy Ghost,\\" \\"Rooming Houses Are Old Women,\\" and \\"The Woman Thing\\" show \\"attempts to unify [women] in this patriarchal society.\\" Poems such as \\"Coal\\" and \\"Generation\\" showcase Lorde's position \\"as a visionary of a better world.\\" The poem \\"Coal\\" is both autobiographical and allegorical in effect, as \\"she not only wrote for herself, but for her children and women as well.\\" In the poem, Lorde's personal self-acceptance of her African American identity is meant to coalesce with the self-acceptance and the unification among all African American women, who Lorde hopes can find the \\"place of power within each of [themselves]\\" and \\"celebrate this womanly well of passion and creativity.\\" Coal is a metaphor for Lorde's African American heritage. However it is \\"also associated with Eros and with creativity; she celebrated this source as what she called 'woman's place of power within each of us.'\\" The metamorphosis from coal into diamond represents Lorde's embracing of her identity, creativity and imagination, as \\"I am Black because I come from the earth's inside now take my word for jewel in the open light\\".  Section II  The second part of the collection appears to deal primarily with the theme of childhood. In \\"Now That I Am Forever With Child\\" Lorde uses nature as a descriptive metaphor of her pregnancy, giving it a pure and ethereal effect, as she describes the child as \\"blooming within [her].\\" In the poem Lorde hopes for her daughter to be a free and independent spirit, harkening back to Lorde's characteristic \\"as a visionary of a better world.\\" In \\"What My Child Learns of the Sea\\" an association is further made between her child and the natural world. In \\"Story Books on a Kitchen Table,\\" Lorde impressionistically recounts her own childhood and experiences with her negligent mother who \\"out of her womb of pain… spat me into her ill-fitting harness of despair.\\" In \\"Poem for a Poet,\\" the reader is given a glimpse of Lorde's own methods as a writer, and features a reference to poet Randall Jarrell.  Section III  Part three of the anthology consists of eleven poems. The poems in this section predominantly discuss Lorde's experiences as both a wife and a mother. In the poem \\"A Child Shall Lead\\" Lorde uses sensory imagery to express her concerns about her son and what will become of him in the future. Another poem \\"Paperweight\\" describes her frustrations with her heterosexual marriage. Throughout the poem, Lorde likens paper to something that can console her, because she uses it to write her poetry. The poem takes a dramatic turn in tone in the last stanza stating \\"or fold them [paper] all into a paper fan / with which to cool my husband's dinner.\\"  Section IV  Part four contains a single poem in 5 sections entitled \\"Martha.\\" The poem delves into the emotional torment Lorde experiences when her partner was in the hospital, after experiencing severe brain trauma in a car accident. Although the poem is written entirely in Lorde's own voice, she also inserts some dialogue, including statements that Martha may or may not have said. Throughout the poem, Lorde offers her own views on life and death as she sits by Martha's side for what appears to be more than a couple of months. When Martha's own family comes to see her, she orders them away, wanting nothing to do with them. Both women reject their typical family lives in order to have a relationship with each other. The last line of the poem reads \\"You cannot get closer to death than this Martha / the nearest you've come to living yourself,\\" leaving it unknown whether or not Martha actually dies.  Section V  The fifth and final section of Lorde's volume primarily revolves around loss, mourning and commemoration. Lorde's personal reaction to unrequited love is an overwhelming theme in this section. There is a tone of sadness in all the poems. In \\"The Songless Lark,\\" one of Lorde's shortest poems in the volume, the speaker mourns the departure of a loved one, declaring, \\"Sun shines so brightly on the hill / before you went away.\\" Lorde seems to end the volume in a bleak tone. The second to last poem of the book, \\"Second Spring\\" begins, \\"We have no passions left to love the spring / who have suffered autumn as we did, alone\\" and finishes the poem with \\"while we stood still / racked on the autumn's weeping / binding cold love to us.\\" Lorde's use of seasonal imagery seems to insinuate the passing of time, but there is a lack of growth and development in the poem. The speaker begins declaring that they have no passions left and ends standing in the cold.  Critical responses  Coal received generally positive reviews from critics, especially among her peers and other female poets.

By 10 December, it was showing a white ribbon, a symbol of the protests, by its on-screen logo. The station's owner, Sindeyeva, explained this as being a sign of \\"sincerity\\", rather than \\"propaganda\\", and an attempt to be \\"mediators\\" instead of simply journalists.

However, the channel was the first mass media outlet that he had chosen to follow on Twitter, according to an RIA Novosti report. Eviction On 26 January 2014, Dozhd ran a survey on its website and on its live \\"Dilettantes\\" discussion program asking viewers if Leningrad should have been surrendered to the invading Nazi army in order to save hundreds of thousands of lives (presenters cited Viktor Astafyev and compared it with the 1812 capture of vacant Moscow). Within 30 minutes, Dozhd removed the poll and apologized for incorrect wording. In the following days Dozhd was criticized by politicians, activists, State Duma members and Valentina Matvienko for its online poll on the Leningrad siege of World War II. Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's press secretary, also criticized the channel and said that they violated \\"more than a law\\". Yuri Pripachkin, President of the Cable Television Association of Russia (AKTR), said that he wanted \\"to take functions of censoring\\". In a resolution backed by the St. Petersburg legislature’s deputies, Prosecutor General Yury Chaika was requested to “conduct an investigation into provocative material posted on the website of the Dozhd television channel … and take appropriate measures, including shutting down the channel.” On 29 January, the largest Russian TV providers disconnected the channel.

Coaching career Club career In 1998, Ágúst took over as head coach of the joint Grótta/KR women's team for the rest of the 1997-1998 season after Andrés Gunnlaugsson was fired. After serving as an assistant coach to the Grótta/KR men's team for the 1998-1999 season, he was hired as the head coach of Valur women's team in May 1999. Under his watch the team won the Icelandic Women's Handball Cup but was knocked out in the Final 8 in the national championship playoffs after losing to Fimmleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar. He resigned from hist post after the season to take over as the head coach of the Iceland women's national handball team. He returned to Valur in 2001 after one year with the national team to serve as an assistant coach to both the men's and women's teams. In February 2002, Ágúst was hired as the head coach of the joint Grótta/KR men's team. He resigned at the end of the 2004-2005 season. He returned once again to Valur in April 2005 when he signed a three year contract to coach the women's team. He guided the team to the 2008 national championship finals where it lost to Stjarnan. In 2008, Ágúst signed a three year contract to coach the Grótta men's team. He left the team after the season, after guiding the club to victory in the 1. deild karla and promotion to Úrvalsdeild karla, and signed with Levanger Håndballklubb of the Norwegian Eliteserien. On 2 March 2012, Ágúst was fired from Levanger with three games left of the season and the team in 10th place. Ágúst was hired as the head coach of SønderjyskE Håndbold women's team in February 2013. He resigned in February 2014 after the team had only won 2 of its 18 games. Shortly later he was hired as an interim coach for HK men's team to finish out the season, replacing Samúel Ívar Árnason. After the season he took over the reins of Víkingur men's team. He guided Víkingur to promotion to the Úrvalsdeild karla in his first season at the club. After a difficult 2015-2016 season, where the team was relegated back to 1. deild karla, Ágúst resigned from his post. In May 2016, Ágúst was hired as the head coach of KR men's team. He guided KR to promotion to the Úrvalsdeild but the team folded after the season as the board of Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur believed that it did not have the adequate facilities to field a team in the top-tier league. In May 2017, Ágúst returned once again to Valur as the head coach of the women's team. On 9 March 2019, he led the team to the Icelandic Women's Handball Cup. On 28 April 2019, he led Valur to the national championship. National team career In March 2000, Ágúst was hired as the head coach of the Iceland women's national handball team. He left the team at the conclusion of his contract in 2001. Ágúst was formerly the head coach for the Iceland women's national handball team, and led the team at the 2011 World Women's Handball Championship in Brazil. He started training the Icelandic women national team in 2000–01 at only 25 years old. In August 2018, Ágúst was hired as the head coach of the Faroe Islands women's national handball team.

The first is that humans have a primary motivation to self expand. The second principle is that individuals often achieve self-expansion through close relationships which allow the inclusion of the other in the self. Self-expansion motivation One of the underlying themes of self-expansion is that individuals have a very basic motive to self-expand. Self-expansion is the desire to enhance an individual's potential efficacy. Motivational models often refer to self- efficacy as one's belief that they are competent and can achieve specific goals. However, within the self-expansion model, potential efficacy is used instead, as it only refers to obtaining resources that will make goal attainment possible. Achievement of this goal is a secondary concern. According to the self-expansion model, people increase potential efficacy by creating close relationships, which in turn, increases material and social resources, perspectives, and identities. Some examples of resources include the following: social support, possessions, information, and friendship networks. Perspectives are the way people appreciate the world and ascribe causal explanations for people's behaviors. Identities refer to a person's memories and characteristics. Self-expansion is not consciously motivated. A person does not explicitly attempt to be part of a close relationship for the sole intention of increasing physical and psychological resources. However, the motivation to self-expand still does influence attraction to others for a potential close relationship. Aron and Aron suggest that our attraction is broken down into two components based on Rotter's value-expectancy approach. Desirability is the perceived total amount of self-expansion possible from a potential close relationship. The second factor, probability, refers to the likelihood that the close relationship with the individual can actually be formed. It can also be conceptualized as the likelihood that self-expansion will occur. Consequently, individuals will seek a partner that has high social status and a greater number of resources. However, to maximize self-expansion, consideration is also given to how likely this person will be loyal and desires to be in the close relationship. Including the other in the self The second principle of the self-expansion model is that people use close relationships to self expand by including the other in the self. The self is often described as the content or the knowledge of who we are. According to Aron and Aron, when entering a close relationship a person should perceive that the self and other should begin to overlap by including aspects of the other in the self. More specifically, when the other makes his or her resources available, this leads to the belief that these resources are now included in the self. These new resources lead to greater inclusion of the other in the self by also incorporating the other's perspectives and identities in the self. Aron, Aron, Tudor and Nelson conducted several classic studies that scientifically demonstrated that we include the other in the self. In one experiment, participants were more likely to distribute money equally between the self and the close other in comparison to distributing the money between oneself and a stranger. The sharing of resources was suggestive of including the self in the other. In a second experiment, participants were more likely to remember more nouns for a stranger than a close other (one's mother). This supported the IOS phenomenon, as participants were more likely to take the perspective of the close other thus not being able to remember descriptive nouns of that person. In a final experiment participants were required to make yes/no decisions on whether certain traits belonged to themselves. Decisions on traits that were different between a participant and a close other had longer reaction times than decisions on traits that were different between a participant and a stranger. It was suggested that the increased confusion between the self and the close other was directly related to integrating the other in the self. The degree of closeness in the relationship affects the self and other reaction studies. As two individuals become closer, there is greater confusion and therefore a longer reaction time. As a result, as closeness of a relationship increases, there will be a greater inclusion of the other in the self. Measuring inclusion of the other in the self Adapted inclusion of other in the self scale. The Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale (IOS Scale) is one of the most frequently used tools to assess this phenomenon. The scale consists of seven Venn diagram-like pairs of circles that vary on the level of overlap between the self and the other. Respondents are asked to select the pair of circles that best represents their current close relationship. Several studies have showed that this measurement tool is effective in getting accurate depictions of the amount of closeness and the inclusion of the other in the self. IOS has also been assessed with the Continuous IOS, a Java-based applet suitable for online surveys that measures IOS on a continuous scale from 0-100 Participants are instructed to use their mouse to move one of the circles (typically labeled \\"self\\") towards the other (typically labeled \\"other\\") until the degree of overlap best describes the relationship in question. The IOS Scale has also been adapted to measure inclusion in other contexts, for example community connectedness via the Inclusion of Community in the Self Scale. The adaptability of IOS is broad as demonstrated by recent versions substituting target with \\"X.\\" Inclusion of the ingroup in the self The idea of including the other in the self has been extended to include an entire ingroup in the self. An ingroup is an interdependent set of individuals with which a person identifies. The individual believes he or she is a member of this group. In fact, several academic groups have found similar findings in the me/not me reaction time paradigm at a group level. Participants showed a slower reaction time for traits that were incongruent between the self and ingroup. This was in comparison to quicker reaction times for traits that were congruent between the self and ingroup. The slow reaction times were consistent with the inclusion of the ingroup in the self claim as it suggested that the individual had included group characteristics in the self. As a result, there was difficulty recalling if a trait belong to the self or ingroup. Several researchers have examined the role of ingroup identification (i.e. a person's prolonged psychological connection to an ingroup) and self- expansion. In fact, Trop and Wright refined the meaning of ingroup identification and believed it was analogous to the inclusion of the ingroup in the self. The authors found that the degree of connectedness to the ingroup will affect confusion of self-descriptors. People who highly identified with an ingroup showed slower reaction times for self-descriptors that did not relate to the ingroup (this is consistent with previous findings). However, low ingroup identification lead to no differences in reaction times between whether or not the self-descriptors were also descriptive of the ingroup. This demonstrated that the level of identification with an ingroup can be conceptualized as the degree to which we will include the ingroup in the self. The central motivation for including the ingroup in the self parallels the self-expansion model at the interpersonal level. The self-expansion model suggests that we are strongly motivated to expand ourselves by including the other in the self. This occurs when an individual incorporates the other's perspectives, identities and resources. Likewise, it has been proposed that including an ingroup in the self, or ingroup identification, is partly influenced by the self-expansion motive. Inclusion of the ingroup's perspectives and resources can increase one's confidence in completing a variety of goals. Thus, a group's attractiveness is often based on the potential for self-expansion. A group with higher social status and a greater amount of potential resources is more likely to be included in the self. Measurement of inclusion of the ingroup in the self Tropp and Wright created an instrument to measure the extent that an individual includes the ingroup in the self. The Inclusion of the Ingroup in the Self Scale (ISS Scale) was based on the Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale. Similar to the original scale, seven pairs of circles vary on the degree of overlap between the self and the particular ingroup. The scale has been well validated and the degree of inclusion of the ingroup in the self is said to capture the sense of ingroup identification. Self-expansion, including the outgroup in the self, and intergroup relations An abundance of research focuses on the negative interactions between different groups (e.g. negative attitudes, intolerance, discrimination). However, there is sparse evidence to explain the positive aspects of intergroup relations such as reduction of prejudice. The contact hypothesis(by Gordon Allport) is one area of psychology that focuses on positive aspects of intergroup relations. The hypothesis suggests that when there is cooperation, equal status, common goals and authority support then contact between members of different groups can result in reduced negative attitudes. In addition, positive emotions between intergroup members was said to be of utmost importance as it would lead to positive attitudes which, in turn, would generalize to the entire outgroup. An outgroup is set of individuals with which the individuals does not identify. It was unclear how this attitude generalization actually happened. Recently, the process of including the outgroup in the self was used as an explanatory mechanism for this generalization. Including the outgroup in the self is based on the similar self-expansion notion of including the other or ingroup in the self. As a person becomes a friend with an outgroup member, the aspects of the outgroup is included in the self when that group is made salient. Essentially, representation of the outgroup and its identity is shared with our representation of the self. Including the outgroup in the self can vary; a person may actually become a member of an outgroup. However, in certain circumstances this is virtually impossible and we simply psychologically identify with the group even though we are aware that we are not part of it. Upon inclusion of the outgroup in the self, we now give that group several benefits. These benefits include taking pride in the group, sharing resources, and positive biases in causal explanations of the group. These benefits all increase the likelihood for reduced outgroup prejudice, hence its use as a mechanism for the contact hypothesis. It is important to note that the focus of the inclusion of the outgroup in the self is initially at the interpersonal level (i.e. between individuals). The interaction needs to have interpersonal closeness for inclusion of the self in the other to occur. Consequently, a decategorized approach to contact should be used where the focus is on personal identities instead of group identities. By focusing on personalization, there is a greater chance for the development of closeness. Eventually, group membership needs to become available so that an individual can now include the outgroup in the self as well. However, it is believed that group membership will become more central in a natural manner as the close relationship develops. Empirical evidence seems to support the inclusion of the outgroup in the self hypothesis. In one study white women were paired off with either another white woman (ingroup member) or a Latina woman (outgroup member). The pairs of women met over an extended period of time completing different activities together, which led to a measurable close friendship. Women with an intergroup friendship were more likely to have positive intergroup attitudes, less likely to endorse anti-minority policies and less likely to demonstrate intergroup anxiety. The study suggests that the intergroup close relationship led to improved attitudes towards the entire outgroup as suggested by the inclusion of the outgroup in the self mechanism. Another study also found that the level of inclusion of the outgroup in the self would affect the amount of decreased prejudicial attitudes. Further, simply including a friend in the self who has a close relationship with an outgroup member can decrease outgroup prejudiced attitudes. Knowing that a friend includes an outgroup member in the self allows for the individual to include that entire outgroup in the self. In turn, this also leads to positive attitudes about the outgroup. Self-expansion motive It may be the case that individuals want to make friends with outgroup members (instead of oppress and mistreat the outgroup) because of the self-expansion motive. Based on Aron and Aron's original work, people want to expand the self and an optimal way of doing so is to make close friendships that give the opportunity for increased perspectives, identities and resources. People who are most similar to ourselves provide a diminished capacity for self-expansion. As a result, an individual may turn to outgroup members for friendship because they are different from one's self-concept. These differences allow for a greater likelihood to increase resources, identities and perspectives, which is consistent with the self-expansion motive. A recent study has shown that, consistent with this idea, priming high self-expansion motivation enhances outgroup self-expansion and the quality and outcomes of outgroup interactions (e.g. greater self-efficacy, reported closeness, and self-growth). Barriers to self-expansion at the intergroup level Self-expansion motives can explain why people may appreciate intergroup contact, however, it can also provide explanations for why we avoid this intergroup contact. People may be cautious of self-expansion due to a sense of self-loss. As we self-expand in one area we may put ourselves at risk of losing aspects of the self in another area. Consequently, people may be fearful of creating a close relationship with an outgroup member as this may trigger animosity from original ingroup members. Often individuals must attempt to balance the potential benefits of including the outgroup in the self with the potential loss of ingroup friends and the associated resources. If the self-loss outweighs the self-expansion, it is possible for a decrease in perceived self-efficacy. The second barrier to self-expansion is the risk that an overabundance of self-expansion might occur in too short a period. The accumulation of new resources and perspectives in our self-concept leads to a need for self-integration (i.e. combining different resources, identities and perspectives into single overarching self-concept). An excessive amount of self-expansion without proper self-integration can be quite stressful (e.g. moving to a new city, or starting a new job). It has been suggested that when a person is socially stable, self-expansion via an outgroup member is most likely to be successful. Consequently, the likelihood for cross-group contact and the inclusion of the outgroup in the self is dependent on the degree of self-expansion in other domains. Expansion = motivation and believing. Self-expansion beyond relationships More recently, self-expansion research has begun to shift away from investigating self-expansion in a social context (e.g. romantic relationships) and instead has focused on self-expansion processes and outcomes of self-expansion at the individual level. Research has also focused on self-expansion in domains such as the workplace. Results of these research studies has shown that self-expansion can (and does) occur at the individual level (e.g. through hobbies and spiritual experiences) and in workplace settings. Similar to findings from social self-expansion literature, individual self-expansion also has positive effects and includes the same processes (e.g. motivation, self-efficacy). Self-expansion has also been presented theoretically within a framework of self-concept change. That is, self-concept change can be thought of as occurring along two independent dimensions: valence (positive vs. negative content) and direction of change (increase vs. decrease in content) and self-expansion represents one of the four possible processes of self-concept change (increasing positive content).

Seabed protection Installation of turbine piles at Amrumbank West through the erosion protection layers. The seabed surface at the construction site mainly consists of sand. It was initially reinforced by a 2.4-m-thick layer of large stones. However, this hindered installation of the turbine piles, which should be driven through the protection layer deep into the seabed. Therefore, stones were replaced by two layers of geotextile containers, i.e., sandbags made of a special damage-resistant nonwoven geotextile. Empty bags had a size of 1.45 × 2.38 m and could accommodate 1 m3 of sand; they were filled on the Rømø island up to 80 vol% and weighed 1400 kg each. The seabed protection withstood the St. Jude storm in October 2013 and Cyclone Xaver in December 2013.

The song has received a fair amount of controversy due to its religious themes and crudeness. Production The song was inspired by both Pope Benedict's 2010 visit to the UK, and the abuse controversy that resurfaced that year. Tim Minchin released it to the Internet with a cartoon of multi-ethnic cardinals and the pope dancing the can-can without any underwear. The song contains over 80 instances of the words \\"fuck\\", \\"motherfucker\\" and derivatives of these. Tim Minchin said \\"I really don't like upsetting people...and I never do it myself unless it is an incredibly carefully thought-out polemic like the Phil Daoust song or the pope song which have carefully constructed points to them.\\" and \\"It's a thing of great beauty because it's a challenge, a desecration of something people hold sacred. I want to make people realise that being angry about being mean about the Pope is completely inappropriate in the context of talking about child abuse.\\" He also explained: Synopsis Tim Minchin explains in this song that removing religion debate from the discussion entirely, anyone protecting other \\"kiddy fuckers\\" is a \\"motherfucker\\", and that this has made him so angry he has been reduced to swearing, which he acknowledges is still not as offensive as a person claiming \\"moral authority\\" when allowing such acts. The purpose of the song being written in a crude and juvenile way is to demonstrate that \\"the actions of the Vatican, who made it a matter of public policy to protect and shelter child rapist priests while covering their actions is revolting, orders or magnitude more revolting than any repeated expletive should be\\". JT Eberhard from Patheos lists these crimes by the pope as follows: * \\"A guy who fails to act against a known pedophile priest\\" * \\"A guy who allows a priest who molested boys to resume pastoral duties after therapy\\" * \\"A guy who halts a secret church trial for a pedophile priest molesting boys after that priest begs him\\" Controversy \\"Protect The Pope\\" released a statement regarding this issue: In early 2012, Patheos.com reported that \\"Tim Minchin performed The Pope Song at the National Mall, which has about a million people upset, because his song contained...a \\"few\\" expletives and said some bad things about the pope\\". The site argues that opposition to the song is because \\"people don't get it\\". The site does acknowledge the argument that \\"Freedom of speech is awesome, but perhaps some venues are more appropriate than others [for] saying \\"fuck\\" an absurdly frequent number of times in a song played publicly\\". Patheos explained one of the fears people have against the anti-religious, curse-word heavy material that Minchin performed: \\"Maybe bad words are like invisible lightning bolts of evil, radiating through the child's body and causing irreparable damage and turning them into atheists who will burn in hell\\". Ooblick.com said those whose mental processes are blocked by the swearing, \\"rendering them incapable of hearing what the song actually had to say\\", are \\"delicate flowers on their fainting couches\\", and therefore provided a censored version for their benefit. It further explained \\"curse words are bad because they make some people feel momentarily uncomfortable. Child rape is bad because it causes physical harm and psychological trauma, often for a lifetime...if you're not angry enough at the church to swear, then what's wrong with you?\\". An investigation was lodged about Tim Minchin vs The Sydney Symphony Orchestra after a complaint said \\"'The Pope Song' was 'distasteful and offensive'; and, that the song's introduction by Tim Minchin was 'inflammatory'\\". The ABC explained \\"the purpose...was to illustrate that the behaviour being criticised, namely pedophilia, is more offensive that the language being used to criticise it\\", and that \\"the coarse language formed a legitimate part of the song and was not gratuitous.\\" It was concluded that \\"The ACMA therefore finds that the ABC did not breach clauses 7.1 of the Code\\" and \\"The ACMA finds that the ABC did not breach clauses 7.7 of the Code\\". The Independent reported \\"on his American tour [in 2011] he found himself piano-less in Dallas when the hire company cancelled his contract, calling him a \\"God-hater\\" and a \\"demon\\"\\". Critical reception JT Eberhard from Patheos.com wrote \\"The message of the song is clear from the lyrics, and is brilliantly written, in my opinion.\\" PZ Myers from scienceblogs.com described the song as \\"utterly delightful\\", and explained \\"it's catchy. You might end up singing it around the house\\". Den of Geek described the song as \\"gloriously obscene\\". The Sydney Morning Herald deemed the song \\"gloriously offensive\\".

Life and politics The year of his birth is unknown, but Callimedon was probably born during the first quarter of the 4th century BCE since he is named as a contemporary of Demosthenes by Athenaeus. He has been identified with a man called \\"Callimedon of Collytus, son of Callicrates,\\" on a late fourth-century Attic inscription recording the lease of a mine.Inscriptiones Graecae II2 1587; cf. . Nothing further is known of this Callicrates, but Callimedon's family appears to have been an influential and aristocratic one from Collytus,. an Athenian neighbourhood south of the Acropolis. Callimedon's grandfather Agyrrhius had been a prominent (and pro- democratic) politician in the early fourth-century and was appointed strategos in 389.Xenophon, Hellenica 4.8.31, . As a member of an elite family, Callimedon had access to the upper rungs of the Athenian social ladder and he appears to have been regarded as something of a local celebrity and raconteur. He was a member of the dining club known as \\"the Sixty\\" which met in the Heracleion at DiomeiaA demos at the southeast of the city-wall; cf. Heracleia. and whose collective wit was so famous that Philip II of Macedon was said to have paid the group a talent to send him a collection of their jokes.Ath. 14.614d: \\"They were gathered at the Temple of Heracles in Diomeia, sixty in number, and in the city they were referred to in phrases like \\"The Sixty said this,\\" and, \\"I've just come from the Sixty\\". Among them were Callimedon the Crayfish and Deinias, as well as Mnasigeiton and Menaechmus, as Telephanes says in his On the Town. Their reputation for amusement was so great that, upon hearing of it, Philip of Macedon sent them a talant so that they might write down their jokes and send them to him.\\" () Dinarchus reports that Demosthenes attempted to prosecute Callimedon in 324 BCE for conspiring with Athenian exiles in Megara to replace the democracy with an oligarchy under Macedonian control.Dinarchus, In Demosthenem 94.

In 710, he was installed as king (Sogdian: ikhshid) of Samarkand after the populace overthrew his predecessor, Tarkhun, due to his pro-Muslim stance. The Umayyad governor, Qutayba ibn Muslim, campaigned against Samarkand but in the end confirmed Gurak as its ruler. Gurak was a cautious and intelligent ruler, and managed, through shifting alliance between the Muslims and the Turgesh, to remain on his throne. Some time after the Muslim pyrrhic victory Battle of the Defile in 731, he managed to recover his capital, Samarkand, and achieve a quasi- independence which he maintained until his death in 737 or 738.

They are most commonly found on deep sea (benthic) fish, but can also be seen on non-benthic fish. Some fish that this feature is found on include: milkfish, herring-like isospondyls, jacks, mullets, and mackerel. The overall anatomy of the eyelids plays an important role in understanding their possible purpose. Purpose Though the true purpose of these bodily structures is not known, it is generally accepted that the eyelids play some role in affecting the vision of the fish or otherwise serving to protect the fish. There are four proposed theories. The first is that the eyelids may act as a lens, increasing the fish's ability to focus on specific objects and interpreting its surroundings better. The second is providing the fish the capability of seeing polarized light. The third theory is that it may block out ultraviolet light, and finally, the fourth theory is the eyelids serve as a physical barrier against foreign objects in the waters. Scientists are still unsure of the biological implications for the second theory. The first theory is more practical because of the presence of this feature on deep sea fish. This ability to see better is crucial for their survival as visibility is severely reduced in the deeper parts of the ocean. The opposite however can be said for the non-benthic fish because there is more light near the surface of the ocean, so there would not necessarily be a need for a stronger sense of sight. Anatomy Most adipose eyelids are separated into anterior and posterior parts, commonly referred to as layers. These layers also vary in number, anywhere from three to five, depending on the fish. The layers are arranged in a parallel fashion, relative to the dorsal fin to the fish's belly. This arrangement makes for eyelids that are optically positive, meaning that a certain amount and type of light will be able to enter the eye. The eyelids also are able to filter out certain wavelengths of light and have different refractive indices for light. The skin of the eyelid is the thinnest over the eyeballs and begins to thicken as it moves on to the cheek and face of the fish. Epithelial tissue and connective tissue formed from several fibers of collagen are the main components of these layers. In some fish, there are three layers, with the middle layer being made of connective tissue, which helps to bind the other two epithelial layers together. Filter Specifics One special detail about adipose eyelids is their ability to filter out specific wavelengths of light. For example, different fish have a different concentration of epithelial tissue in their eyelids. However, there is a range that most of the eyelids will filter. Most adipose eyelids can filter out light that has a wavelength shorter than 305 nanometers. Another fact is that these eyelids can also reflect light and this level of reflection corresponds to polarization of the light and the angle at which it is shone. To test for these ranges, different fish eyelids were exposed to light generated from photometers and polarizing microscopes.

The species is known from the early to middle Miocene sediments exposed in Western Oregon, Washington state, USA and Northern Graham Island, Haida Gwaii, Canada. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Parviflora. History and classification The eleven leaf specimens used to describe Acer browni were recovered from five different sites. The largest group of specimens was recovered from the early Miocene, Aquitanian, Collawash site exposed near the Collawash River in Clackamas County Oregon. Two additional paratype leaves were recovered from outcrops of the Latah Formation at the Vera site near Veradale, Washington. Another Washington site, on Bunker Creek west of Centralia, Washington produced one paratype leaf of middle Miocene age. The last paratype leaf is from the species' northernmost location, having been recovered from an outcrop of the late early Miocene Skonun Formation on the northern side of Graham Island in the Haida Gwaii of British Columbia. In addition to the leaf specimens a series of paratype specimens were described for the associated samaras recovered at the Collawash site and United States Geological Survey site USGS 8904 near the Little Butte Creek in Jackson County, Oregon. The type specimens for Acer browni are placed into three different repositories. The holotype leaf and thirteen of the paratypes are currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections housed at the University of California Museum of Paleontology, in Berkeley, California. Three other paratype leaves and one paratype samara are housed in the National Museum of Natural History, part of the Smithsonian while the last paratype leaf is part of the University of British Columbia collections in Vancouver, British Columbia. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. browni in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name browni is in recognition of paleobotanist Roland Wilbur Brown for his many contributions to Tertiary paleobotany. Description Leaves of Acer browni are simple in structure, with perfectly actinodromus vein structure and are generally oblate to widely elliptical in shape. The leaves are five-lobed with the basal two lobes small while the upper lateral lobes are about two-thirds as long as the median lobe and all lobes being triangular in outline. The leaves have five primary veins and range between long by wide in overall dimensions. A. browni has small teeth while the lobes have a distinct and complex bracing of veins formed by the joining of two external secondary veins. The combination of morphological features is not found in any modern species besides A. nipponicum and as such A. browni is placed into the section Parviflora. The samaras of A. browni have a notably inflated nutlet and acutely diverging veins which rarely anastomise. The overall shape of the nutlet is circular to elliptic with the average length of the samara up to and a wing width of . The paired samaras of the species have a 25° to 30° attachment angle and the distal region of the nutlet and wing forming distinct u-shaped shallow sulcus. While similar in morphology to A. nipponicum, the two related species can be separated by the sulcus which is developed in A. browni but not seen in the samaras of A. nipponicum.

It was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in 1937. Mrs. Sheridan (Elizabeth Ann Linley) was a talented musician who enjoyed professional success in Bath and London before marrying Richard Brinsley Sheridan in 1773 and abandoning her career. She was 31-33 when she sat for Gainsborough, dying from tuberculosis seven years later at the age of thirty-eight. The portrait was painted between 1785 and 1787, and, was exhibited at Gainsborough's studio at Schomberg House, Pall Mall in 1786. Background Elizabeth Ann Sheridan (née Linley) was born in the autumn of 1754 but the exact date varies with sources giving 4, 5 or 7 September, at either Abbey Green or 5 Pierrepont Street, Bath. Her father was Thomas Linley, an English musician and composer, and her mother was Mary Johnson (1729–1820) who was also a talented musician. Elizabeth was the couple's eldest daughter – there was an older brother but he died in early childhood– several of whom inherited their parents musical abilities. It is likely she began singing at concerts when she was only nine years old and made her formal stage début alongside her brother, also named Thomas, in 1767 at Covent Garden, London. At the end of 1770, she was betrothed to an elderly but wealthy suitor, Walter Long, but the engagement was broken off shortly before the wedding took place. Long paid her compensation of £3,000 in 1771 and she also received £1,000 worth of clothing and jewellery. She moved to France in 1772 accompanied by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and an invalid marriage may have taken place in March 1772 but there are no official records to verify it. The couple were officially married on 13 April 1773 after their return to Britain, the period when Elizabeth was described by Frances Burney as \\"infinitely superior to all other English singers.\\" According to later newspaper reports their courtship was \\"one of the classic romances of the west country\\" and she was \\"the most beautiful singer in England\\". After they were officially married Sheridan would not allow her to appear on stage in a professional capacity as he felt it reflected badly on his status as a gentleman. Thomas Gainsborough had been a friend of the family since 1759 and he painted several portraits of the Linley family. Elizabeth was also the model for the Joshua Reynolds painting St Cecilia, which was successfully exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1775, and described by Reynolds as \\"the best picture I ever painted.\\" The Sheridans had a tempestuous marriage as they were an ill-matched couple with Sheridan preferring city life in contrast to Elizabeth's love of the countryside. Elizabeth begged her husband to \\"Take me out of the whirl of the world, place me in the quiet and simple scenes of life I was born for.\\" Sheridan had several affairs, as did Elizabeth, and they spent a great deal of time apart. By the time she was 36, in 1790, Elizabeth was showing signs of ill-health but had to maintain the appearance of an involvement with London society. While visiting Devonshire House Elizabeth met Lord Edward FitzGerald and they became lovers. She conceived a child by him, a baby girl who was born on 30 March 1792. The trauma of childbirth exacerbated Elizabeth's illness and she died of tuberculosis on 28 June 1792. Description The oil on canvas painting measures . The depiction of full-figure portraits in nature was a speciality of 18th-century English artists, especially Gainsborough who delighted in painting landscapes; Elizabeth with her love for the English countryside was the ideal model for him. The composition is diagonal and is in the grand manner genre. The NGA describes the work as \\"freely painted\\" and impressionistic in style. The sitter's garb and \\"the windblown landscape ... reflect the strong romantic component in Gainsborough's artistic temperament ... Her chin and mouth are firm, definite, and sculptural, and her heavily drawn eyebrows give her a steady, composed, and dignified expression. There is a hint of romantic melancholy in her eyes, with their slightly indirect gaze ... The painting is executed in liquid paint, blended wet into wet, applied in many layers in order to create a rich and sumptuous effect, with thin washes in free-flowing brushstrokes for the details.\\" Although using an outside setting, it is not a conversation piece; it has a certain psychological depth brought about with the attention given to the details of dress and texture as testaments to worldly elegance and wealth. The model's hair is treated in the same manner as the leaves and branches of the trees in the background and some of the sunset's pink glaze is reflected in the colour of her gown. The lonely tree behind her matches her isolated figure and adds to the impression of the remoteness of the abandoned feminine figure in the deserted landscape; possibly longing for something she cannot achieve in her life. A shimmering transparent effect is given to the hand-held scarf by the use of long brush strokes and thin oil colour. The portrait captures the model's charming personality and fresh beauty; her face is the only part of the painting that is calm and solid. The paint is applied with soft and nervous, flying brush strokes. The artist is treating the surface of the woman's gown with long zigzagging brushes of thin oil paint all the way down to her feet, to achieve the vibrant effect, versus the calm of her face. The painting came into the possession of Harriet, Lady Robert Spencer (previously wife of Edward Bouverie) of Delapre Abbey, who were friends of the Sheridan's as a result, of Sheridan's money problems. In her diary on 12 March 1872, following the sale of the portrait by Harriet's grandson General Everard Bouverie to Alfred de Rothschild. Mrs. Caulfield, wife of the second son of the first Earl of Charlesmont wrote:- ::\\"I have heard today of the sale of the beautiful portrait of Mrs. Sheridan by Gainsborough, which I have gased at so often over the library fireplace at Delapré , and that it bought £3,000. Baron Rothschild being the purchaser. I think it well to note that that I heard from the father of the late General B., known as Squire Bouverie, the manner in which the picture came into the family. Sheridan was at the time in great money difficulties, and living next door to Lady Robert Spencer, Squire Bouverie's mother, when a seizure was made by the Sheriff. Sheridan's servant knew the value his master set on this picture of his beautiful wife, and he managed to detach it hurriedly from the frame (a very large one and to get it over the wall into Lady Robert Spencer's garden. Poor Sheridan was glad to save the picture from his creditors, and leave it in his fiend's hands, from whom he got advances of money until he should redeem it. That redemption never occurred, and so it became Bouverie property, and has now realised £3,000.\\"Northampton Chronicle and Echo - Monday 08 June 1903, page 2 The painting was subsequently owned by various members of the famous Rothschild banking family up until 1936, when it was sold to the Duveen Brothers, Inc., in London. The A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, Pittsburgh bought the artwork on 26 April 1937 and it was then donated to the National Gallery of Art.

Founded in 1985, it has been owned by Hood River Distillers since 2014. It is most well known for its eau de vie produced from Bartlett pears, though today it also makes a variety of other fruit brandies, aged spirits, and liqueurs.  History  Clear Creek Distillery was founded in 1985 by Stephen McCarthy. The McCarthy family had owned orchards in Oregon since the turn of the century, although Stephen had been running the family's alternative business of manufacturing parts for hunting guns. This endeavor required travel to Europe, where he encountered the Alsace tradition of producing pear eau de vie. He decided to begin making eau de vie from the Bartlett pears grown widely in Oregon after concluding they were similar to the Williams pears that were often used for eau de vie production in Europe. He produced the first batches of the spirit in 1985. The production of European-style fruit brandies is relatively unusual in the United States, and the Clear Creek Distillery is one of the best known American eau de vie distilleries. The beverage is still a niche product not consumed by most U.S. drinkers. The company was sold to Hood River Distillers in 2014.  Products  The distillery's \\"pear in a bottle\\" eau de vie Based on the traditional eau de vie de Poire Williams, Clear Creek Distillery's pear eau de vie is its most popular product, and it also sells a limited edition version with a pear grown inside the bottle. It also makes other traditional varieties of fruit brandy such as an aged apple brandy made from Golden Delicious apples, grappa from Oregon wine grapes, framboise, Mirabelle plum eau de vie, kirschwasser, and slivovitz. More unusually, Clear Creek produces an eau de vie that includes some of the spring buds of the Douglas fir tree. Clear Creek also makes a variety of fruit-based liqueurs and McCarthy's Single Malt whiskey.

Biography  He was the son of the Technical Director at Norddeutscher Lloyd. After graduating from the local Gymnasium, he attended the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1889 to 1893. Among his teachers there were Eugen Dücker and Peter Janssen. In 1894, he was persuaded by Otto Modersohn to set up a studio at the Artists' Colony in Worpswede, where he became fascinated with painting the desolate moorlands. In 1897, he married one of his students, Hermine Rohte, who had sought him out as a teacher after seeing an exhibition of his works at the Munich Glaspalast. She would also achieve some fame as a painter. Their son, Fritz Theodor Overbeck, was a noted botanist. Around 1900, he became one of the many artists who were selected in a series of contests to design trading cards for the chocolate-maker Ludwig Stollwerck.Goldoni, Maria: \\"Eine Stollwerck-Serie von Heinrich Vogeler und Franz Eichert\\" in Tagungsband Esslingen 2002, Arbeitskreis Bild, Druck & Papier. In 1905, after Hermine was diagnosed with tuberculosis, he and his family moved to Vegesack, where he specialized in painting the beaches and sand dunes. He later became a member of the Deutscher Künstlerbund. In 1909 he died, suddenly, from a stroke. He was buried at the Waller Friedhof in Bremen. Hermine survived her illness and devoted much of her time to promoting his work. In 1990, his granddaughter Gertrud established the \\"Fritz and Hermine Overbeck Foundation\\", to preserve and publicize his work.

Four years later, he moved to the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe, where he studied under Hermann Baisch. In July 1889, he made his first visit to Worpswede with Fritz Mackensen.

In 1895, they presented their first group exhibition at the Kunsthalle Bremen. They were largely panned by the critics, but went on to a major breakthrough at the Munich Glaspalast. In 1897, the Art Colony was officially established and Modersohn married Helene Schröder (1868-1900), the daughter of a Bremen merchant.

His third wife was , daughter of the painter Heinrich Breling. She was primarily a singer, but painted as well. They had two sons, Ulrich (1913-1943) and , who also became a painter. In 1911, when the Kunsthalle Bremen purchased Van Gogh's Field with Poppies, Modersohn was the only Worpswede artist to support the museum, concluding that nationalistic sentiments should play no role in the world of art. In the 1920s and early 30s, he and Louise made extensive study trips throughout Germany and, in 1933, he acquired an old farmhouse on the Gailenberg in Bad Hindelang for use as a studio. Three years later, he became blind in his right eye, due to a detached retina. This forced him to remain in his studio rather than paint outdoors. He was awarded the Goethe Medal for Art & Science in 1940. A year before his death, he was persuaded to speak on the subject of visual arts at the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.

The flight was on a non-scheduled international passenger service from Manchester to Barcelona. British tour operator Clarksons Holidays had contracted the aircraft to carry a group of holidaymakers who had booked an all-inclusive package holiday with it. The crash resulted in the aircraft's destruction and the deaths of all 112 on board. It was the deadliest aviation accident in 1970, and remains the highest death toll of any accident or incident involving the De Havilland Comet anywhere in the world. The crash was Dan-Air's first fatal accident killing fare-paying passengers. News of the first major accident in the company's eighteenth year of existence\\"Barcelona Comet crash\\", Flight International, 9 July 1970, p. 39 came just two days after British tour operator Global Holidays had awarded it a four-year, £2.5 million contract for all Global charter flights from Birmingham, starting in April 1971.Airliner World (The Last of Dan-Air's Comets – Dan-Air and the Comet), Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, November 2010, p. 71The Spirit of Dan-Air, Simons, G.M., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1993, p. 58 The aircraft The aircraft, operated by Dan Air Services Ltd, was a de Havilland DH 106 Comet series 4 (registration: G-APDN, construction/manufacturer's serial number: 6415) that had its first flight in 1959. Dan-Air acquired the aircraft from British Overseas Airways Corporation – its original operator – in 1969. At the time of the accident it had flown 25,786 hours. Accident Flight 1903, which had departed Manchester at 16:08 local time, encountered air traffic control (ATC) delays in the Paris area, resulting in a change of route. Radio contact between the pilot flying the aircraft and Barcelona Area Control Centre (ACC) was established at 17:53 local time, following which ACC gave the flightdeck crew clearance to descend from to . Six minutes later, the flight was handed over to Barcelona ATC (approach control), and acknowledged that Runway 25 was in use at Barcelona Airport. Approach control cleared the crew to overfly the Sabadell non-directional beacon (NDB) to the north of Barcelona VOR and descend further to . This involved turning left to a heading of approximately 140 degrees to intercept the extended centreline of runway 25 at . While carrying out the left turn as instructed, the crew reported in error that they had passed the Sabadell NDB. In fact they were still 28 nautical miles north of Sabadell at the time, over the Serralada del Montseny, a mountain range in which the highest peaks rise to over . As, according to ATC, another aircraft overflew Sabadell at the same time, Barcelona ATC mistook that second aircraft's radar echo for that of the Dan-Air Comet and so the air traffic controller handling the Dan-Air flight did not notice the navigational error by the Comet's crew. However, there is no proof that another aircraft overflew the Sabadell beacon at that time. The testament of the air traffic controller remains implausible. Due to lack of evidence to the contrary, the controller cleared the Dan-Air crew to continue their descent to . At approximately 18:05 local time, the aircraft crashed into a group of beech trees on the north-east slopes of the Les Agudes peak at an altitude of about . At the time of the accident, Les Agudes was under half cloud cover at with good visibility below. The explosion following the impact completely destroyed the aircraft and instantly killed everyone on board. The crash site was located from Sabadell on a bearing of 45 degrees, where the mountains reach a height of . After an extensive all-night search over a wide area, rescue teams reached the crash site the following day. The Spanish authorities insisted on an immediate burial of the dead bodies due to public health reasons. Cause The investigation identified a combination of erroneous information, in relation to en-route reporting points and the existence of a radar echo from another aircraft that overflew the Sabadell NDB at the same time as the Dan-Air crew mistakenly reported passing it, as the accident's probable cause. This combination resulted in an involuntary error on the part of both ATC and aircraft that could not be corrected by the time the air traffic controller realised that his instructions to the aircraft's crew were given in response to a mutual misunderstanding, which resulted from a navigational error on the crew's part that had gone unnoticed.

Approximately 4,400 videotaped interviews are deposited with the Yale University Library and housed in Sterling Memorial Library. The archive pioneered the usage of video testimonies to record eyewitness accounts of major historical events. It has served as the primary inspiration for video testimony projects documenting other state-sanctioned crimes against humanity and their aftermaths. History The antecedents for the establishment of the archive was a meeting between Laurel Vlock, a television journalist at WTNH News 8 of Connecticut, and Dori Laub, a child Holocaust survivor and New Haven psychiatrist. In May 1979, the two arranged for a professional video crew to film the Holocaust testimonies of four survivors. Recognizing the extraordinary impact of these stories, Vlock and Laub were determined to do more. They partnered with William Rosenberg, the president of the local chapter of the Farband, a labor Zionist organization, which had many Holocaust survivors among its members. On 28 June 1979, the Holocaust Survivors Film Project (HFSP) was formally launched. Geoffrey Hartman, a professor of English and comparative literature at Yale, was also one of the key founding members. His wife, Renée, was one of the first four survivors taped. Shortly thereafter, Vlock received a commitment from WNEW-TV of New York City to air a documentary based on the testimonies. The resulting work, Forever Yesterday, won a regional New York Emmy Award in 1980 for \\"Outstanding Discussion/Interview Program.\\" By 1981, Laub and Vlock had collected 183 testimonies under the auspices of HFSP and formally deposited them at Yale University. In 1987, Mr. Rosenberg, representing the HSFP, transferred the original 183 testimonies from a deposit at Yale to a permanent donation. That year, the collection was also renamed the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, in recognition of a generous endowment gift provided by Alan A. Fortunoff. In the 1990s, the Fortunoff Archive achieved greater international recognition. In 1990, composer Steve Reich's piece, Different Trains, which incorporated soundbites from the Fortunoff testimonies, won a Grammy Award for best contemporary classical composition. Lawrence Langer's acclaimed 1991 book, Holocaust Testimonies: The Ruins of Memory, was based on the author's eight years of viewing and studying the archive's testimonies. It was named one of the ten best books of the year by The New York Times Book Review and also received the National Book Critics Circle Award under the \\"Criticism\\" category. The 1995 centennial issue of The New York Times Book Review listed Holocaust Testimonies as one of the hundred most important books of the century. The Fortunoff testimonies also served as a basis for Witness: Voices from the Holocaust, a critically acclaimed documentary that was nationally broadcast by PBS on Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day) in May 2000. In February 2011, Yale University Library began digitizing the Fortunoff Archive's more than 4,400 testimonies, scheduled to be completed in 2014. The professional format on which the testimonies were originally recorded is obsolete because the analog decks are no longer manufactured. Digitization is essential for preservation. Impact The Fortunoff Archive pioneered the usage of video testimonies to record eyewitness accounts of major historical events. Prior to the existence of the Archive, researchers relied on audio and written testimonies. The Archive has served as the primary inspiration for video testimony projects documenting the Cambodian genocide, ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia and other crimes against humanity.

While English lexically differentiates theological sin from legal crime, the Chinese language uses one word zui 罪 meaning \\"crime; guilt; misconduct; sin; fault; blame.\\" Terminology Chinese has two common words meaning \\"sin\\": zui () and guo (). The German sociologist Wolfram Eberhard wrote Guilt and Sin in Traditional China, which said zui has three basic meanings \\"crime, punishment of a crime, and sin\\", and guo means \\"a criminal act which has been unintentionally committed, as well as a sin which has been committed without any intention\\" . Zui can mean \\"crime; criminal act; punishment; guilt; fault; blame; wrongdoing; misconduct; sin; suffering; hardship\\". Some zui compounds, such as youzui 有罪 (with \\"have; there is\\") \\"guilty (of an offense); sinful\\", are ambiguous between \\"crime\\" and \\"sin\\"; while others are unequivocal, such as fanzui 犯罪 (with \\"crime; criminal\\") \\"commit a crime; criminal act\\" or yuanzui 原罪 (with \\"origin; source\\") \\"original sin\\". The Chinese character 罪 for zui combines wang 罒 or 网 \\"net\\" over fei 非 \\"wrong\\", ideographically depicting, \\"A 网 net used to capture the criminal who has done 非 wrong\\" (Bishop 2011). Zui was used to translate Chinese Buddhist terminology, for instance, zuizhang 罪障 (with \\"obstruction\\") \\"sin\\" and zuiye 罪業 (with \\"action\\") \\"sinful karma\\". Zui 罪 \\"crime; guilt; punishment\\" had an archaic variant Chinese character zui 辠, written with zi 自 \\"nose\\" and xin 辛 \\"painful\\" — emphasizing the \\"punishment\\" aspect of zui. For instance, under traditional Chinese law, the excruciating Five Punishments included yi 劓 \\"cutting off the nose\\". The (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary defined the original meanings of these homophonous zui characters as罪 \\"fish trap\\" and 辠 \\"crime; punishment\\", and noted Qin dynasty (221 BCE-206 BCE) imperial naming taboo made 辠 obsolete. The first Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang 秦始皇 forbid using zui 辠 \\"crime\\", which graphically resembled huang 皇 \\"emperor\\" in his name, and replaced it with zui 罪 (Schuessler 2007:637). In Modern Standard Chinese character usage, zui 罪 is common and zui 辠 is rare. Guo nominally means \\"fault; mistake; error; excess\\" and verbally \\"pass by; go past; surpass; cross; exceed\\". The specialized sense of \\"sin\\" is usually limited to Daoist usage, except for the Chinese \\"synonym compound\\" zuiguo(r) 罪過(兒) \\"fault; wicked act; sin; offense\\", which is a humble expression for \\"guilty conscience; this is really more than I deserve.\\" Words meaning \\"sin; violation of religious law\\" are not a linguistic universal. For instance, the anthropologist Verrier Elwin, who studied the Gondi language, said, \\"There are no words in Gondi for sin or virtue: a man may be ruined, here and hereafter, for a breach of a taboo, but the notion of retribution for sinners is an alien importation\\" . The Gondi language word pap \\"sin\\" is a loanword from the Marathi language. Fürer-Haimendorf explains that, > … throughout the Christian era men and women of the western world believed > in the existence of a universal phenomenon which they called sin. The > tongues they spoke provided terms (peccatum, péché, sin, Sünde etc.) which > referred to this phenomenon and it was not until the age of discovery that > Christian missionaries encountered languages which did not contain any > comparable terms. The existence of such languages leads us inevitably to the > conclusion that the concept and with it the sense of sin cannot be common to > all branches of humanity. This raises the question whether some societies > lack the very idea that certain modes of conduct are not only undesirable in > the eyes of other men but that they also bring the actor into conflict with > supernatural powers believed to play the role of guardians of morality—in > other words whether there exist ethnic groups devoid of any concept of 'sin' > in the conventional sense. (1974:540) Historical origins The word zui 辠 or 罪 \\"crime; guilt\\" occurred in Chinese classics and bronze inscriptions from the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE). Eberhard concluded that \\"sin\\" was unknown prior to the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). > If we apply our definition of \\"sin\\" – a violation of a divine code – Chinese > folk religion before the Han period (206 B.C.) seems not to have had the > concept of sin, although it recognized a great number of supernatural > beings. People who offended the deities, spirits, or other supernatural > beings by not honoring them or by failing to sacrifice in the right way or > at the right time might make them angry. The deities then could or would > punish such people. An event of this kind was more or less like any offense > against a human superior, with the only difference that deities were > believed to be superior to humans; they formed, if this expression be > permitted, a social class above the upper class in human society. This class > of supernatural beings was structured: some deities had more, others less, > power, but the structure was more like a class structure than like a > bureaucratic one although one god was vaguely recognized as the highest of > all. The Chinese historian Yu Ying-shih disagreed with Eberhard's conclusion that early Chinese religions disregarded \\"sin\\" because > … our knowledge of folk religion in ancient China is still too limited to > warrant such a general statement. In his Analects Confucius once quoted a > saying that was apparently common among the people as follows: \\"He who sins > against heaven has none to whom he can pray.\\" The word \\"sin\\" (tsui) here > seems close enough to mean a violation of a divine code. However, none of the English Analects translations renders zui as \\"sin\\". This context (3/13) quotes Confucius explaining a rhymed adage about sacrificing to either the Kitchen God or ancestral spirits. *\\"He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray\\" (James Legge) *\\"He who has put himself in the wrong with Heaven has no means of expiation left\\" (Arthur Waley) *\\"If you incur blame with Heaven, you have nowhere to turn for forgiveness\\" (Burton Watson) *\\"If you offend Heaven, there is no one you can pray to\\" (A. Charles Muller) Bodde also disagreed with Eberhard. > I see no reason why the idea of sin must derive solely from belief in a > divine law court—an obvious projection of the terrestrial law courts of > bureaucratic China. On the contrary, the idea of sin could equally well > spring from the fear of violating supernatural sanctions, even though not > thought of as codified and bureaucratically administered. If one accepts > this supposition, it then become evident that the concept of sin was already > known in pre-Buddhist China, though in a form less widespread and perhaps > less acutely felt than that disseminated by Buddhism and religious Taoism. Chinese Buddhism The history of Chinese Buddhism began circa the 1st or 2nd century CE when Silk Road Buddhist missionaries (originally perceived as foreign Huang-Lao Daoists) arrived in China. Defining \\"folk Buddhism\\" as \\"a simplified form which even the uneducated could understand\\", Wolfram said, > It seems that folk Buddhism almost immediately brought to China the concept > of sin and of punishment of sin. Texts, which are attributed to the late > second century A.D., already enumerated the punishments meted out to the > souls of sinners in different \\"hells.\\" A sin committed during a lifetime was > not immediately punished, but the sinner received punishment after death. > This was an attempt to answer the eternal question why some people who had > committed many crimes or immoral acts had a good life until their death, > escaping punishment by human justice. Pre-Buddhist ethics had no answer to > this problem other than to refer to fate (ming) as an unclear, inscrutable > power. Ming 命 \\"life; fate; destiny; command\\" was personified in the Siming 司命 (lit. \\"Controller of Fate\\"), who arbitrated human destiny. When Buddhist missionaries, such as An Shigao (d. 168 CE), began translating sūtras into Chinese, they used zui 罪 \\"crime; guilt\\" for Sanskrit pāpa or pāpá पाप \\"evil, misfortune, bad luck, trouble, mischief, harm; sin, vice, crime, guilt.\\" Pāpa arises from intentions and actions that are akuśala \\"evil; inauspicious; unwholesome\\", which is translated as Chinese e 惡 \\"evil\\" or bushan 不善 \\"not good; unholy; bad; evil\\". Damien Keown (2003:211) explains, \\"Essentially, pāpa is that which leads one away from nirvāṇa, and is closer to the concept of error than an offence against divine authority or a condition innate in human nature such as original sin.\\" Buddhist monks and nuns practice pāpa-deśanā \\"confession of sins/infringements (of the Patimokkha code)\\", which Chinese transliterates as chanhui 懺悔 \\"repent; confess\\". The alternate term xiangbihui 向彼悔 \\"repent sins to others\\" (from pratideśanīya) emphasizes publicly confessing to the monastic sangha \\"community\\". Buddhist confession is not considered an appeal for divine absolution, but an aid to spiritual progress and clearing karmic obstacles. In the 5th century, Chinese Buddhists used wei 穢 \\"dirty; vile; abominable; ugly\\" to denote \\"sin\\", and correspondingly, \\"the Buddhist 'paradise,' the place in which there is no sin\\" is called jingtu 淨土 \\"clean land; pure land\\" . The Buddhist notion of \\"sin\\", translated as Chinese zui, was explained in terms of karma and reincarnation. Thus, Eberhard explains, > The folk-Buddhistic concept of sin did not refer to an action against a > single deity or to the provocation of divine anger, but it meant a violation > of a moral code which was somehow set, and was applicable to and valid for > the world of the gods as well as the world of man. Even if human justice had > dealt with the criminal according to the law of the society, his offense > still remained to be punished. Folk Buddhism eliminated the caprices or > arbitrary reactions of deities, and instituted a religious system that we > might call constitutional monarchism, that is, the belief in a law that is > absolutely binding even for the judge and is administered in an impersonal > manner by an appointed heavenly judge. further described the \\"divine ministries and divine red tape\\" of modern Chinese folk religion as \\"a system of bureaucratic constitutional monarchy\\". Buddhism opposes pāpa \\"sin; demerit\\" with punya \\"merit; meritorious action\\", referring to karmic merit gained from actions like giving alms, reciting sutras, and performing puja devotions. The Chinese translation of punya is gong 功 \\" achievement; result; skill; meritorious service\\", compounded in gong- guo 功過 \\"achievements and errors; merits and sins\\". The ethnologist Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf described the importance of karmic \\"merit\\" in Chinese spiritual thought, > … as Buddhism spread into China from the first century A.D. onwards the idea > of sin and the punishment of sins gained wide currency. Indeed the > systematisation of such punishments in numerous minutely described hells > reflects the Chinese genius for classification. These supernatural > punishments for violations of an impersonal moral code were independent of > the mechanism of human justice. There was a strong emphasis on the feeling > of guilt. Even if sinful actions remained undetected by society, the sinner > knew that they were recorded by supernatural powers, and that punishment > would inevitably follow after death. But like Tibetan Buddhists the Chinese > believed that sins could be outweighed by meritorious actions. Hence > feelings of guilt stimulated the giving of alms and support for monks and > religious institutions. (1974: 551) The Buddhist scholar Alfred Bloom refuted the common Western belief that Chinese and Japanese religions have no sense of \\"sin\\" or \\"guilt\\". > Sin and guilt are generally viewed from a Christian perspective in which sin > is rebellion against the will of God, and consequent guilt is the feeling of > rejection by the divine. Such sin and guilt is, of course, not experienced > in the Buddhist context. However, it may be possible to employ the terms, or > similar terms such as \\"depravity\\" or \\"defiled\\" to depict man's involvement > in the passions and bondage to the world which prevents him from attaining > the high Buddhist ideals revealed in Sakyamuni and his early disciples. Such > people realize that they fall short of the potentialities of the human > nature symbolized in Buddha. Their guilt is derived not from a feeling of > rejection by deity, but by a self-rejection as they become aware of the gulf > which separates them from the ideals of the Buddha. (1967:144-145) Some Buddhist Schools, such as Pure Land, teach that we are currently in the degenerate and immoral Mappō \\"Latter Day of the Dharma\\", and can find salvation from sin through faith in Amitābha. Daoism Early Daoist religious movements – Yellow Turban, Celestial Master, and Highest Clarity schools – believed that guo 過 \\"excess; sin\\" causes sickness and confession cures it. The recorded history of Daoist \\"sin\\" began in the 2nd-century CE, contemporaneous with the Buddhist introduction of zui 罪 \\"guilt; sin\\". The role of \\"sin\\" in Daoism is frequently misconstrued. For instance, one introductory text (Cooper et al. 2010:14) claims, \\"Taoism has no doctrine of sin. Ethics should be incidental to spiritual values, and indeed, there is no ideograph in Chinese which conveys the Western conception of sin and a sense of guilt.\\" As mentioned above, zui 罪 means both \\"sin\\" and \\"guilt.\\" Yellow Turban The Yellow Turban Rebellion (184-205 CE) against the Han dynasty was led by Zhang Jue, who founded Taiping Dao \\"The Way of Great Peace\\", based on the Taiping Jing \\"Scripture of Great Peace.\\" According to Stephen Bokenkamp, > The Yellow Turbans converted people to their cause through healing > practices, including old methods such as incantation and doses of water > infused with the ashes of talismans, and a new one – confession of sins. > This latter practice is significant. The Scripture of Great Peace relates > confession to the idea that political and cosmic diseases are caused by > humans and must be cured on the individual level. Sin, in this text, is the > failure to act in accord with one's social role, thereby blocking the > circulation of the Dao's energies. (1997:33) This scripture teaches that sins result in natural disasters, epidemics, social discontent, and war. \\"Evil has accumulated for innumerable generations through the inheritance of sins\\" (tr. Kaltenmark 1979:24), and heaven has sent the Celestial Master to save humanity. The Scripture of Great Peace gives examples of the six worst sins (1979:33-34), such as accumulating Dao \\"the way\\" or De \\"inner power\\" without teaching them to others, and accumulating riches without aiding the poor. The Taiping Jing introduced the Daoist dogma of chengfu 承負 \\"inherited burden\\", roughly comparable with Christian ancestral sin. Toshiaki Yamada (2008:265) explains that chengfu \\"refers to the liability for sins and transgressions that individuals and societies inherit from their predecessors. As fault and blame are passed from one generation to another, calamities and misfortune increase.\\" Later generations can make amends for the sins of their ancestors, through reflective siguo 思過 \\"considering sin\\", confessional shouguo 首過 \\"admitting sin\\"), and corrective zize 自責 \\"blaming oneself\\". Daoist chengfu fundamentally differs from Buddhist karma. > In Buddhism, the good and evil performed by an individual in past lives is > reflected in what form his or her present life takes, and good and evil > behavior in the present life determines future rebirth. Chengfu, by > contrast, not only considers the past and future lives of the individual, > but also that individuals inherit the results of the good and evil of the > behavior of their ancestors, and that these results accumulate not only at > the individual level, but also at the social level. In this sense, > \\"inherited burden\\" is based on the unit of the family and, as its extension, > of society. (Yamada 2008:266) Celestial Master The Tianshi Dao Way of the Celestial Masters, founded by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE, taught that the gods maintained celestial registers of good and evil deeds, and regarded sickness as divine punishment for sins. The Celestial Masters adapted Yellow Turban beliefs about sin, summarized by the French sinologist Isabelle Robinet. > Law and morality were one. The gods, some of whom were of popular origin, > like the gods of the earth and the hearth, watched for and recorded misdeeds > such as drunkenness, debauchery, and theft. These had to be expiated by > confession, often public, and by penances that consisted of community > service, such as road repair, or a retreat (into \\"purity chambers\\") to > encourage the sinner to reflect. Sickness was seen as a punishment for sin > and treated by religious methods like confession or the use of holy water. > (1997:58-59) In cases where Daoist religious practices did not cure sickness, (Bokenkamp 1997:299) \\"the failure was said to be caused by their not keeping faith with the Dao\\". The tutan zhai 塗炭齋 \\"mud and ashes retreat\\" was a Celestial Master ritual meant to rescue the participants and their ancestors from sufferings in diyu 地獄 \\"earth prison; hell; naraka; purgatory\\" (Bokenkamp 1997:162, Robinet 1997:60). A Taoist priest would daub his face with mud and ashes (a synecdoche for flood and fire and metaphor for suffering) in penitence, lie on the (preferably frozen) ground, with hands tied behind his back (like a criminal), and confess past sins. Highest Clarity The Shangqing \\"Highest Clarity\\" School also believed in both individual and ancestral sins. Jeaneane Fowler (2005:143) stated, \\"The unbreakable bond with ancestors was emphasized in the belief that the sins of the ancestors of several generations past still affected the individual of today. However, reciprocally, the relative sin or merit of a living individual could also affect that of past ancestors. And if that living individual were to achieve salvation, then so would the ancestors.\\" In Highest Clarity tradition (Bokenkamp 1997:299), annual confession of sins was required on the autumnal equinox because that is the day when the spirits of one's body reported sins and transgressions to the Sage Lord. Sacred Jewel The Lingbao \\"Sacred Jewel\\" School of Daoism, which originated in the early 5th century, adapted Buddhist many precepts such as sin and reincarnation. The Sanyuan pin 三元品 \\"Precepts of the Three Primes\\" text lists 22 sins for \\"those who pursue the highest Dao\\": *The sin to disregard the scriptures and precepts, harbor doubts or be in two minds about the teaching. *The sin to despise the sagely writings or criticize the sacred scriptures. *The sin to make light of the teachers or break the solemn oath. *The sin to slander the elders or disregard the heavenly rules. *The sin to steal the texts of the scriptures or practice without the proper teacher. *The sin to study on your own, without a teacher, or transmit the teachings without proper authorization. ... It further lists 145 sins for \\"students of the Dao and lay followers\\": *The sin to pick a fight with a good fellow. *The sin to speak evil or hypocrisy. *The sin to criticize your teachers, elders, or anyone else. *The sin to intoxicate yourself with wine and spirits. *The sin to kill living beings or give rise to evil thoughts. *The sin to harbor greed and passion, pride and sloth. ... (tr. Kohn 1993:100-101) Beginning around the Song dynasty (960–1279), the idea of gongguo ge 功過格 \\"ledgers of merit and demerit\\" became widespread, with sins divinely calculated as demerit points (Yamada 2008:266). Kristofer Schipper (1993:222) noted that although modern Daoists believe the sin of losing qi \\"vital energy\\" can lead to illness and accidents, sin \\"is not considered to be irreducible (there is no \\"original sin\\"). Neither it is something that is solely and simply moral, but is rather related to the equilibrium of the body.\\" Chinese Christianity The concept of \\"sin; offense against god\\" is a long-standing hamartiological problem for Christianity in China. Uhalley and Wu (2001:71-72) described it as a \\"notorious crux in Christian-Confucian dialogue\\"; \\"The central issues here are the doctrines of sin as an offense against God, original sin, and redemption, which are, for Christians, revealed doctrines. But all are absent from, rather than contrary to, Confucian values.\\" Early Jesuit missionaries generally translated Latin peccatum \\"sin\\" with the Buddhist term zui 罪 \\"guilt; sin\\" rather than the Daoist guo 過 \\"exceed; sin\\". Some semantically related Chinese words are chan 懺 \\"repent; regret; confess (sins)\\", hui 悔 \\"regret, repent; show remorse\\", chanhui 懺悔 \\"confess; repent\\", shezui 赦罪 \\" pardon (a criminal); forgive (a sinner)\\", zuiquian 罪愆 \\"offense; sin of omission\\", buke raoshu de zui 不可饶恕的罪 \\"mortal sin\\", and ke yuanliang de zui 可原谅的罪 \\"venial sin\\". Some Christian missionaries in China apologetically blamed their lack of converts upon Chinese misunderstandings of \\"sin\\". John claimed, \\"Sin, however, in the Scriptural sense, is not recognized by their system. The contrast of good and evil, according to their view, resolves itself into a difference in degree.\\" James Legge (1881:294) said neither Confucianism nor Daoism knew anything about the propitiation of sin, and, \\"The knowledge of God in Confucianism, which has become a heritage of the Chinese people, is very precious; but the restriction of the worship of Him to the sovereign has prevented the growth and wide development among them of a sense of sin.\\" Dyer Ball (1927:535-536) described the \\"vague\\" Chinese idea of sin, and \\"the task of tasks is to bring home to the native mind the sense of what sin is. In the 1980s-1990s, after the end of the Cultural Revolution, a number of Chinese Cultural Christians have advocated for the doctrine of original sin as having warrant in mainland China due to the sociopolitical unrest that it has recently experienced . Sociological aspects Cultural anthropology traditionally distinguished two modalities of social control: a shame society based on inculcating feelings of shame and the threat of ostracism, and a guilt society based on feelings of guilt and the threat of punishment. Western scholars generally classify the Chinese and Japanese societies as shame based, emphasizing the psychological fear of losing face. Eberhard explained that in traditional Chinese culture, > Sin was defined as actions, behavior, and thoughts that violated rules set > up by supernatural powers. Sin is the equivalent of legal guilt, which is a > violation of rules set up by earthly powers and the emotion which results > from such a violation of legal rules. We might say that persons who have > such a concept of \\"sin,\\" and the emotions accompanying a sinful act or > thought, seem to have internalized social norms to a perhaps even higher > degree than persons who have only a feeling for legal guilt, because Chinese > supernatural rules are based upon social norms. They are not in > contradiction to these social norms and laws but strengthen and tighten > them. criticized this position: \\"Eberhard's separation of shame from guilt and sin seems to be too absolute and arbitrary. Surely in traditional China, as in other societies, all three feelings frequently entered into cases of wrongdoing, even though their proportions might vary according to the background of the particular wrongdoer.\\" Based on experiments in cross- cultural psychiatry (see ), modern scholars doubt the thesis of a Chinese \\"shame culture.\\" See also *Bahá'í views on sin *Buddhist views on sin *Islamic views on sin *Jewish views on sin References *Ball, J.

The seeking out of such favorable environments, most notably the courts of England and Wales, has been dubbed libel tourism. Purpose British MPs have criticized the libel laws as being \\"Soviet-style\\" tools with which the rich and powerful hide their secrets. The filmmakers have expressed their concern about the threat that such laws pose to the freedoms of speech and of the press around the world, and intend to use the film as a means by which the dangers of such practices can be brought to public attention. Film content Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz's operations The film focuses on the libel suit brought forth in English courts by Saudi Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz against writer and terrorism and political corruption expert Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld. Bin Mahfouz claimed that the allegations that Dr. Ehrenfeld made against him in her book Funding Evil were libelous, as he had never \\"knowingly funded terrorism\\". While Dr. Ehrenfeld never makes any assertions about the degree of bin Mahfouz's cognizance of the alleged funding, she does say that bin Mahfouz founded and/or operates a number of bogus front organizations that operate under the guise of charities, but whose actual objectives are frequently the funding and support of terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Examples of such organizations are the Muwafaq (\\"Blessed Relief\\") Foundation, the International Islamic Relief Organization (HRO), and the National Commercial Bank (NCB). These claims have been bolstered by some degree by the U.S. Treasury Department, who in October 2001, froze the assets of Yasin al-Qadi, another Saudi who had been hired to run the Muwafaq Foundation \\"charity\\", who they listed as a supporter of terrorism. Causes of libel tourism's prevalence The film asserts that \\"because English courts aren't bound by a written constitution that protects freedom of expression\\" (in contrast to the courts of the United States) England has become a haven for those seeking to suppress information via libel lawsuits. This is given as the reason why bin Mahfouz filed his lawsuit in the U.K., rather than in the U.S., where the book was initially published. Ehrenfeld ignored the English courts in an effort to avoid a costly legal battle. Regardless of the evidence supporter Dr. Ehrenfeld's allegations, she claims that as soon as bin Mahfouz's lawyers presented their case to Lord Justice Eady, and he was told that the foreword of Dr. Ehrenfeld's book was written by former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency R. James Woolsey, he was eager to award judgment in bin Mahfouz's favor, along with an injunction. Ehrenfeld was ordered to pay fines and expenses of £114,386.52, publish an apology, and physically destroy all copies of her book remaining in England. Outcome of litigations Ehrenfeld filed an appeal in American federal court, which ultimately led to the SPEECH Act, which protects Americans from the rulings of foreign libel judgments, unless they comply with the U.S. First Amendment, marking a major victory in the protection of the free press. Critical reception Reviewers have lauded the concise poignance of the film, calling it a \\"chilling 8-minutes\\" that adeptly explain the importance of the protection of the freedom of media, and have praised the filmmakers for covering an important topic that is conspicuously overlooked by other media outlets.

Alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) are based on the transport of alkaline anions, usually hydroxide , between the electrodes. Original AFCs used aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) as an electrolyte. The AAEMFCs use instead a polymer membrane that transports hydroxide anions. Alkaline Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell  Mechanism  In an AAEMFC, the fuel, hydrogen or methanol, is supplied at the anode and oxygen through air, and water are supplied at cathode. Fuel is oxidized at anode and oxygen is reduced at cathode. At cathode, oxygen reduction produces hydroxides ions (OH−) that migrate through the electrolyte towards the anode. At anode, hydroxide ions react with the fuel to produce water and electrons. Electrons go through the circuit producing current. Electrochemical reactions when hydrogen is the fuel At Anode: H2 \\\\+ 2OH− → 2H2O + 2e− At cathode: O2 \\\\+ 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH− Electrochemical reactions when methanol is the fuel At anode: CH3OH + 6OH− → CO2 \\\\+ 5H2O + 6e- At cathode: 3/2O2 \\\\+ 3H2O + 6e− → 6OH−  Comparison with traditional alkaline fuel cell  The alkaline fuel cell used by NASA in 1960s for Apollo and Space Shuttle program generated electricity at nearly 70% efficiency using aqueous solution of KOH as an electrolyte. In that situation, CO2 coming in through oxidant air stream and generated as by product from oxidation of methanol, if methanol is the fuel, reacts with electrolyte KOH forming CO32−/HCO3−. Unfortunately as a consequence, K2CO3 or KHCO3− precipitate on the electrodes. However, this effect has found to be mitigated by the removal of cationic counterions from the electrode, and carbonate formation has been found to be entirely reversible by several industrial and academic groups, most notably Varcoe. Low-cost CO2 systems have been developed using air as the oxidant source. In alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cell, aqueous KOH is replaced with a solid polymer electrolyte membrane, that can conduct hydroxide ions. This could overcome the problems of electrolyte leakage and carbonate precipitation, though still taking advantage of benefits of operating a fuel cell in an alkaline environment. In AAEMFCs, CO2 reacts with water forming H2CO3, which further dissociate to HCO3− and CO32−. The equilibrium concentration of CO32−/HCO3− is less than 0.07% and there is no precipitation on the electrodes in the absence of cations (K+, Na+). The absence of cations is, however, difficult to achieve, as most membranes are conditioned to functional hydroxide or bicarbonate forms out of their initial, chemically stable halogen form, and may significantly impact fuel cell performance by both competitively adsorbing to active sites and exerting Helmholtz-layer effects. In comparison, against alkaline fuel cell, alkali anion exchange membrane fuel cells also protect the electrode from solid carbonate precipitation, which can cause fuel (oxygen/hydrogen) transport problem during start-up.Anion Exchange Membrane and Ionomer for Alkaline Membrane Fuel Cells The large majority of membranes/ionomer that have been developed are fully hydrocarbon, allowing for much easier catalyst recycling and lower fuel crossover. Methanol has an advantage of easier storage and transportation and has higher volumetric energy density compared to hydrogen. Also, methanol crossover from anode to cathode is reduced in AAEMFCs compared to PEMFCs, due to the opposite direction of ion transport in the membrane, from cathode to anode. In addition, use of higher alcohols such as ethanol and propanol is possible in AAEMFCs, since anode potential in AAEMFCs is sufficient to oxidize C-C bonds present in alcohols.  Challenges  The biggest challenge in developing AAEMFCs is the anion exchange membrane (AEM). A typical AEM is composed of a polymer backbone with tethered cationic ion-exchange groups to facilitate the movement of free OH− ions. This is the inverse of Nafion used for PEMFCs, where an anion is covalently attached to the polymer and protons hop from one site to another. The challenge is to fabricate AEM with high OH− ion conductivity and mechanical stability without chemical deterioration at elevated pH and temperatures. The main mechanisms of degradation are Hofmann elimination when β-hydrogens are present and direct nucleophilic attack by OH− ion at the cationic site. One approach towards improving the chemical stability towards Hofmann elimination is to remove all β-hydrogens at the cationic site. All these degradation reactions limit the polymer backbone chemistries and the cations that can be incorporated for developing AEM. Another challenge is achieving OH− ion conductivity comparable to H+ conductivity observed in PEMFCs. Since the diffusion coefficient of OH− ions is half that of H+ (in bulk water), a higher concentration of OH− ions is needed to achieve similar results, which in turn needs higher ion exchange capacity of the polymer. However, high ion exchange capacity leads to excessive swelling of polymer on hydration and concomitant loss of mechanical properties. Management of water in AEMFCs has also been shown to be a challenge. Recent research has shown that careful balancing of the humidity of the feed gases significantly improves fuel cell performance.

It is located in Karaka, New Zealand, south of Auckland and since 2005 has been used as a site for Spookers; and since 2013 a site for Asylum Paintball and Laser Combat; three New Zealand attractions. Spookers is believed to be Australasia's only haunted attraction scream park , and \\"the number 1 Haunted Attraction in the Southern Hemisphere\\". According to stuff.co.nz, Kingseat Hospital is considered one of the most haunted locations in New Zealand.  Origin and name  The psychiatric hospital was built in Karaka from 1929. The construction began when twenty patients from a nearby mental institution came to the site along with twelve wheelbarrows and ten shovels. Dr. Henry Bennett was originally the former owner of Kingseat hospital in the 1950s. Kingseat Hospital was named after a hospital in Aberdeenshire, Scotland following Dr. Gray (the Director-General of the Mental Health Division of the Health Department at the time) returning from an overseas trip, who felt it appropriate to have a sister hospital with the same name in New Zealand. Flower gardens, shrubs and trees were grown in the grounds of Kingseat Hospital such as surplus plants from the Ellerslie Racecourse and Norfolk Island pines originally seeds from Sir George Grey's garden on Kawau Island.  Operation history  A view of the hospital. Kingseat Hospital was in operation from 1932. In 1939, the Public Works Department and Fletcher Construction Company, Ltd. agreed on the construction of a two-storey nurses home at Kingseat Hospital, with the government to provide the steel for the building. The hospital grew throughout the mid-late 1930s and 1940s to such an extent that by the beginning of 1947, there were over eight hundred patients. During the 1950s, Dr. Henry Bennett (the man whom the mental health wing at Waikato Hospital is named after) was a senior medical officer of health at Kingseat Hospital. From 1964, nursing staff at Kingseat were given name tags to wear on their uniforms. In 1968, certain nurses at Kingseat Hospital went on strike, which forced the administration to invite unemployed people and volunteers to assist within the hospital grounds with domestic chores. In 1973, a therapeutic pool was opened by the then- Mayoress of Auckland, Mrs. Barbara Goodman, four years before the main swimming pool was added to the hospital in 1977. The site celebrated its 50th anniversary jubilee in 1982. During the 1970s and 1980s, there were many places attached to psychiatric hospitals in New Zealand where alcoholics were treated for their drinking addictions and Villas 4 and 11 at Kingseat Hospital served this purpose. In later years, the hospital accepted voluntary patients.Problems led to psychosis, suicide bid In 1996, South Auckland Health sold Kingseat Hospital after government decisions to replace ongoing hospitalisation of mentally ill patients with community care and rehabilitation units. This led to the eventual closure of Kingseat Hospital in July 1999, when the final patients were re-located off the complex to a mental health unit in Otara.  Post-hospital use  After the closure of Kingseat Hospital in 1999, the grounds were initially considered as a potential site for a new prison, able to accommodate for six hundred inmates. In 2000, legal action was taken against the Tainui tribe for financial issues involving the former hospital. By 2004, more than two-hundred people had come forward to file complaints against the national government for claims of mistreatment and abuse of patients at New Zealand's psychiatric institutions (including Kingseat Hospital) during the 1960s and 1970s. In 2005, a television episode of Ghost Hunt featured the site of the former hospital. , the most common apparition reportedly seen at Kingseat Hospital was the \\"Grey Nurse\\", believed to be a former staff member, in and around the former nurses' home. In 2009, the owning company of the former hospital claimed it would proceed with plans to disconnect the water supply of residents within the local region, leaving many to either pay large fees for a different supply or to install new water tanks. By that year, the Freaky Forest of Fear, and CornEvil had been offered as on-site attractions. In 2011, ideas were proposed to grow the area in the Kingseat suburb tenfold for the area's equine industry. This involved propositions of rezoning to residential a majority of the land around Kingseat Hospital although certain buildings, structures and plant life on the former hospital site were protected due to historic and cultural value. In 2013, a property developer revealed a plan to transform the site of the hospital into a countryside living estate with four hundred and fifty homes. The plan sparked debate over which buildings and their park-like surroundings should stay as a reminder of its past, with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust requesting better protection of heritage values of buildings and plants. But some residents insisted that the complex represented a sad past and shouldn’t be highlighted as heritage. That same year, Haunted Auckland conducted a paranormal investigation at the site.Kingseat Nurses Hostel / Spookers Retrieved January 2014 In the following two years, Haunted Auckland conducted a further ten research visits within various buildings at Kingseat; including the notorious Maximum Security Wing.

Spookers hold annual O'Scares Awards at the old Kingseat Hospital. In 2007, Spookers received three Stevenson Franklin Country Business Awards nominations. In 2010, New Zealand filmmaker Dale Stewart shot his horror film Compound at the former hospital property after receiving permission from Spookers, the current owners. Spookers were finalists of the year's Tourism Industry Awards.

Three different Mexican factions were known to have launched raids into Texas at the time but most of the evidence suggests that either Seditionists or Carrancistas were responsible for the incursion. Four American soldiers were killed during the battle, along with at least six of the raiders, and the resulting American punitive expedition further strained the already hostile relationship between the Mexican and United States governments.Stout, pg. 82–84 Background The Mexican Revolution created widespread unrest in the border areas of the United States and Mexico. By early 1915, a group of Mexican rebels, calling themselves Seditionists, drafted the Plan of San Diego with the intention of bringing the American border states under the control of President Venustiano Carranza. They then began attacking military outposts, small towns, and ranches in South Texas. The Seditionists were originally led by Luis de la Rosa but, in June 1916, he was arrested by Carrancista authorities, while traveling to Monterey, and put under house arrest. According to Joseph Allan Stout, author of Border conflict: Villistas, Carrancistas, and the Punitive Expedition, De la Rosa's arrest, combined with the previous capture of other Seditionist leaders, effectively ended the campaign by early 1916. However, Stout says that the superintendent of the Mexican National Railway, Esteban Fierros, was suspected of organizing raids during the summer of 1916, in accordance with the plan, and even \\"scheduled an invasion of the United States\\" to take place on June 10. Sure enough, that same day American soldiers pursued a band of raiders to Matamoros and just five days later San Ygnacio was attacked. The rebels of Pancho Villa were also active in raiding along the Texas border but the territory they controlled at the time was mostly in Chihuahua, far to the northwest of San Ygnacio. Also, the raid occurred while General John J. Pershing was dispersing Villa's forces as part of the Mexican Expedition. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Villistas were responsible. Finally, there was the Mexican Army, also known as the Constitutionalistas or Carrancistas, which had already shown hostility towards the United States on several occasions and threatened to kill American soldiers. On April 12, 1916, the Carrancistas backed up their threats and attacked the 13th Cavalry at Parral and after the San Ygnacio Raid, on June 21, they attacked the 10th Cavalry in the Battle of Carrizal.Stout, pg. 67–76Beede, pg. 218 Raid San Ygnacio was just another small South Texas border town, situated about thirty miles south of Laredo and 180 miles west of Brownsville, on the banks of the Rio Grande. In 1908 there were only 198 residents but the town had several general stores, a post office, and a drugstore, as well as houses and other associated buildings. Because of the unrest in that area, Troop I and Troop M, 14th Cavalry, were stationed at a camp just outside San Ygncio. Altogether the American force numbered about 150 men, The raid began at about 2:00 am, on June 15, when over 100 Mexicans attacked the cavalry camp. A New York Times article, dated June 16, says that an American sentry heard noises from some underbrush near the camp and when a patrol was sent to investigate the sound it was fired upon. Hastily the Americans assembled in a series of trenches and repulsed the attack. Official United States Army records state that three enlisted men were killed and about six more were wounded, one of them fatally. The Mexicans lost in between six and eight men killed, according to differing accounts, and several captured. American reports said they recovered the bodies of six Mexicans and that several others may have been wounded before they escaped back to Mexico. One of the Mexicans killed at San Ygnacio was identified by the United States Army as Lieutenant Colonel Villareal, of the Constitutional Army. The Americans first assumed that Villareal was either a Seditionist or a Villista but a captured raider said that he was \\"not a member of any plan [of San Diego] nor a Villista, but a Carrancista [Constitutionalist] soldier who was just obeying orders.\\" This may not have been true though, according to Stout, because General Alfredo Ricaut, of the Constitutional Army, was campaigning against raiders during the time of the attack.United States War Department, pg. 188http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/mexBorder/New_York_Division_NG_Record_Mexican_Border.pdf Aftermath Major Alonzo Gray was in command of the American forces during the battle and immediately after it he was authorized to command a punitive expedition to pursue the raiders. Major Gray crossed the border into Tamaulipas, on June 16, but he was unsuccessful in finding the Mexicans' trail. Meanwhile, about thirty raiders fired on some men of the 26th Infantry near San Benito, Texas. General James Parker responded by sending Colonel Robert Bullard and 400 soldiers into Mexico on the same day. Bullard's men engaged the raiders in a \\"stiff skirmish\\" near the border but it ended \\"apparently without casualties.\\" The Americans could not pursue any further because General Ricaut, under orders from Carranza, assembled 1,000 soldiers in Matamoros and threatened to attack them unless they returned to the United States. Ricault also vowed to catch the raiders himself, armed the civilian population of Matamoros and \\"ripped up\\" the railroad tracks leading across the Rio Grande. Ricaut's men would eventually capture forty of the raiders and later that day, after the bloodless skirmish, they attacked Major Edward Anderson, 3rd Cavalry, and his squadron of men as they were heading back to Texas. During the firefight that followed, two of the Mexicans were killed without loss on the Americans' side.Smith, pg. 433The Independent, Volume 86, pg. 504–505 Both the San Ignacio and San Benito raids, along with General Pershing expedition in Chihuahua, created a situation in the United States and Mexico that seemed to be a \\"repetition of that process that brought Europe into war in 1914.\\" Just two days after the raids, on June 18, President Woodrow Wilson announced that he was sending the remaining National Guard regiments to the border, not including the Arizona, New Mexico and Texas regiments which had already been in position since May. Within two weeks, American reinforcements began to arrive and by the end of the year over 150,000 militiamen were in position. Wilson also sent sixteen additional warships to patrol the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico's Pacific coast. Carranza followed suit by concentrating his forces along the border and issuing a \\"general call to the civilians of Mexico to arm themselves\\" in preparation for an American invasion. According to the New outlook, Volume 113; \\"there were spectacles in the cities of the United States not since 1898\\" during the Spanish–American War. In addition, thousands of Americans living in Mexico began fleeing north, or to the safety of the United States Navy. War would never come though, other than a raid near Fort Hancock, Texas on June 31, incursions into American territory ceased by July, which helped resolve some of the tension between the two nations. It wasn't until late 1917 that a new series of attacks would begin. But, like the engagement near Fort Hancock, they all occurred in West Texas, far away from where the Seditionists were active. Another factor that prevented an escalation of the conflict was that neither Wilson or Carranza wanted war. Wilson was focused on events in Europe and Carranza said he was \\"absolutely certain that the American people do not want war with Mexico ... but there are nevertheless strong American interests and strong Mexican interests determine to procure a conflict between the counties. ... the Mexican government firmly desires to maintain peace with the American Government, but in order to [reach this goal] it is [imperative] that the American Government explain frankly its true intention towards Mexico.\\" Alleging that Wilson was interested in more than just stopping the raids. Wilson responded to Carranza by voicing his concerns, saying; \\"for three years the Mexican Republic has been torn with Civil strife; the lives of Americans and other aliens have been sacrificed; vast properties developed by American capital and enterprise have been destroyed or rendered nonproductive; bandits [raiders] have been permitted to roam through the territory contiguous to the United States and to seize, without punishment or effective attempt at punishment, the property of Americans.\\" References  Category:History of Texas Category:History of Mexico Category:20th-century military history of the United States Category:Conflicts in 1916 Category:1916 in Texas Category:1916 in Mexico Category:Battles of the Mexican Revolution involving the United States Category:American frontier Category:Military raids Category:June 1915 events ","title":"Raid on San Ygnacio"},{"id":"34019512","text":"The Netherland Inn and Complex is a historic house museum in Kingsport, Tennessee, United States. Built in 1802 to serve as a boat yard for salt distribution, the property was eventually sold, and in 1818 it became the Netherland Inn, serving travelers en route from Middle Tennessee to Western Kentucky. The inn and boatyard is the only place on the National Register of Historic Places that served as a stage stop and a boatyard. History The building was built in 1802, and then expanded in 1808, by William King. King built it with the goal of creating a boatyard to ship the salt he produced. The building was sold in 1818 to Richard Netherland, who built Netherland as it exists today: a 3-story building with an inn and a tavern on Great Old Stage Road, the main route between Western Kentucky and Middle Tennessee. Notable people such as Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, and James Polk visited the inn. Prominent state legislator John Netherland, a son of Richard, grew up at the inn.Marie Day and W. Calvin Dickenson, \\"The Netherland Inn,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 60 (1980), pp. 75-76. The inn stayed in the Netherland family until 1906, when it was acquired by H.C. and Nettie Cloud, who used it as a boarding house and their own home. In 1968, it was bought by the Netherland Inn Association, who preserved the building as a historic house museum. The inn and boatyard was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 23, 1969, and is the only site that has served as both a boatyard and a stagestop. Today The inn is an example of American frontier settlement, using documentation from the journals of Richard Netherland and related resources, to develop its museum experience. The first floor is a tavern, the second family quarters, and the third floor is guest rooms, all depicted as they would have been in during the early 19th century. The majority of the original contents of the inn were destroyed during the American Civil War, however, selected pieces in the museum's collection are original.

The short was released on February 1, 1935, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary The film opens to Buddy's movie theater, to which hundreds of eager moviegoers flock for tonight's triple feature. Our Hero distributes tickets, but excuses himself for a moment to answer the telephone; as he speaks, a small child ingests the entire roll of tickets, leaving Buddy to use the child as a disburser unit. One patron orders a single ticket, only to walk past the ticket booth to reveal that she is, in fact, harboring an older gentleman under her coat! All of a sudden, Buddy is out of tickets. He closes the window, leaving the toddler alone on the edge; the child begins to cry, but Buddy solves this by handing him a lollipop. Buddy picks up several reels of film to take up to the projection room. Having happily surmounted several flights of stairs, he encounters difficulty in opening the door of the room. The force of his final, successful tug sends him sliding down the banister on the same path that he took upward. The film is tumbling as well. Luckily, Buddy reaches the floor first, and the reels pile up neatly into his waiting hands as he continues his slide on the ground level. Buddy, movie in hand, crashes into a water fountain, and the reels fly out of his hand and behind him, piling up neatly once again. Undaunted, he picks them up. Within the auditorium, one patron, sitting on the aisle, is continually annoyed by other patrons wishing to pass him and sit in the same row. Frustrated enough, he rips his mounted seat out of the ground and moves into the aisle. Before the main feature (a picture starring Cookie & titled \\"The Chinchilla\\"), we see a newsreel. In Italy, Prime Minister \\"Mausoleum\\" (Benito Mussolini) has lowered the mandatory age for military service, and so several toddlers in uniform stride past him for review. In \\"Yodel\\", Switzerland, the Swiss navy launches the nation's newest battle cruiser, which sinks into the sea not a moment after her first embarkation. The Swiss officials present show a pleasant apathy for the situation! Back in the projection room, Buddy mends a broken film reel by hammering a staple into it. He places the reel in the projector and starts the film, this time an advertisement for \\"Attractions Coming\\". There is an obvious flaw with the positioning of the projector, which Buddy adjusts so that the screen displays \\"Coming Attractions,\\" as it should. Apparently, this coming motion picture is \\"The Smash Hit of the Century (three years in the remaking)\\". \\"It's Gigantic!\\" announces the painted wings of an approaching plane. \\"It's Stupendous!\\" \\"It's Colossal!\\" And then, \\"Super-Colossal!\\" \\"In fact,\\" says a plane that falls, unceremoniously, to the earth, \\"it's almost mediocre.\\" \\"Don't fail to see James Bagknee (James Cagney) in \\"Here Comes the Gravy.\\" The advertisements and local snipes continue, and finally, we come to \\"The Chinchilla\\", the Film within a film. Cookie sits at a piano, playing \\"How High Can a Little Bird Fly?\\" when an ape-like beast comes through her window; the ape becomes trapped in the piano, Cookie flees, but as the beast comes to the window to continue the chase, we see that she is trapped, by her shirt, on a tree branch. She screams for help! Buddy is eager to save her. By a pulley device, he is able to switch the projection screen to a clothesline, on which hangs a pair of long underwear. The ape, fantastically transported, jumps to its entrapment. Buddy then takes an open film reel and hurls it from the room, into the movie theater itself. The reel catches onto a chandelier. Buddy then swings onto the screen, kicking the ape in the process, and disappears for a moment. He re- emerges with a wooden plank, with which he smacks the beast into the distance. When Buddy manually returns the movie screen to its place, his sweetheart still magically dangles from the same branch. Taking a step ladder, Buddy goes to rescue her, but falls forward onto the screen, collapsing it in the process. Buddy pops out from under the folds of the cloth, a bit dazed (and conspicuously without Cookie!) The film reels and snipes Some of the clips retain clips from various Buddy shorts. The title of the newsreel is \\"Passé News\\", an obvious parody of \\"Pathé News.\\" The rooster, the company's mascot appears to yell a reused scream from \\"Buddy of the Apes\\" instead of clucks.

In April 1885, Vincent wrote his brother about his first masterpiece, The Potato Eaters. He was currently working on the painting, which was to become one of his first complex compositions with multiple figures, and illustrated the letter with a sketch of the work, writing \\"See, this is what the composition has now become. I’ve painted it on a fairly large canvas, and as the sketch is now, I believe there’s life in it.\\" The Letters of Vincent van Gogh refers to a collection of 903 surviving letters written (820) or received (83) by Vincent van Gogh.\\"Overview of all the letters\\". Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam. Retrieved November 4, 2015. More than 650 of these were from Vincent to his brother Theo.\\"Van Gogh as letter-writer\\". Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam. Retrieved October 19, 2015. The collection also includes letters van Gogh wrote to his sister Wil and other relatives, as well as between artists such as Paul Gauguin, Anthon van Rappard and Émile Bernard.Pomerans (1997), xiii Vincent's sister-in-law and wife to his brother Theo, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, spent many years after her husband's death in 1891 compiling the letters, which were first published in 1914. Arnold Pomerans, editor of a 1966 selection of the letters, wrote that Theo \\"was the kind of man who saved even the smallest scrap of paper\\", and it is to this trait that the public owes the 663 letters from Vincent. By contrast Vincent infrequently kept letters sent him and just 84 have survived, of which 39 were from Theo. Nevertheless, it is to these letters between the brothers that is owed much of what is known today about Vincent van Gogh. The only period where the public is relatively uninformed is the Parisian period when they shared an apartment and had no need to correspond. The letters effectively play much the same role in shedding light on the art of the period as those between the de Goncourt brothers do for literature.Pomerans (1997), xv–xvii Background and publication history Theo van Gogh's wife, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, devoted many years to compiling the letters about which she wrote: \\"When as Theo's young wife I entered in 1889, our flat in the Cité Pigalle in Paris, I found at the bottom of a small desk a drawer full of letters from Vincent\\". Within two years both brothers were dead: Vincent as the result of a gunshot wound, and Theo from illness. Joanna began the task of completing the collection, which was published in full in January 1914. That first edition consisted of three volumes, and was followed in 1952–1954 by a four-volume edition that included additional letters. Jan Hulsker suggested, in 1987, that the letters be organized in date order, and undertaking that began in 1994 when the Van Gogh Letter Project was initiated by the Van Gogh Museum. The project consists of a complete annotated collection of letters written by and to Vincent. Exhibition and early publication In the last days of December 1901, running through January 1902, Bruno Cassirer and his cousin Paul Cassirer organized the first van Gogh exhibition in Berlin, Germany. Paul Cassirer first established a market for van Gogh, and then, with the assistance of Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, controlled market prices. In 1906 Bruno Cassirer published a small volume of selected letters of Vincent's to Theo van Gogh, translated into German.The date 1908 proposed in The posthumous fate of Vincent van Gogh 1890–1970, by John Rewald, (first published in Museumjournaal, August–September 1970), John Rewald Studies in Post- Impressionism, p. 248, published by Abrams 1986, The letters Of the 844 surviving letters that van Gogh wrote, 663 were written to Theo, 9 to Theo and Jo. Of the letters Vincent received from Theo, only 39 survive.\\"Van Gogh as Writer\\" Retrieved December 16. The first letter was written when Vincent was 19 and begins, \\"My dear Theo\\". At that time Vincent was not yet developed as a letter writer – he was factual, but not introspective. When he moved to London, and later to Paris, he began to add more personal information.\\"The Earliest Letters\\" Beginning in 1888 and ending a year later, van Gogh wrote 22 letters to Émile Bernard in which the tone is different from those to Theo. In these letters, van Gogh wrote more about his techniques, his use of color, and his theories.Lubow, Arthur. \\"Letters from Vincent\\". Smithsonian. Volume 38, Issue 10. (2008). The letters as literature Van Gogh was an avid reader, and his letters reflect his literary pursuits as well as a uniquely authentic literary style. His writing style in the letters reflects the literature he read and valued: Balzac, historians such as Michelet, and naturalists such as Zola, Voltaire and Flaubert.Pomerans (1997), xx Additionally he read novels written by George Eliot, Charlotte Brontë, and Charles Dickens, as well as John Keats's poetry, reading mostly at night when the light was too poor for painting. Gauguin told him \\"that he read too much\\". Van Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker wrote of van Gogh's letters, \\"Vincent was able to express himself splendidly, and it is this remarkable writing talent that has secured the letters their lasting place in world literature\\". Poet W. H. Auden wrote about the letters, \\"there is scarcely one letter by van Gogh which I ... do not find fascinating\\". Pomerans believes the letters to be on the level of \\"world literature\\" based on style and the ability to express himself. In the letters Vincent reflects different facets of his personality and he adopts a tone specific to his circumstances. At the time he went through a stage of religious fanaticism, his letters fully reflect his thoughts; at the time he was involved with Sien Hoornik his letters reflect his feelings. The letters as chronicle of an artist's life Van Gogh's letters paint a chronicle of an artist's life, with the notable omission of the period when he lived in Paris and therefore had no need to correspond with his brother. The letters can be read as an autobiography of an artist; time spent in Brabant, Paris and London, The Hague, Drenthe, Nuenen, Antwerp, Arles, Saint-Remy and Auvers chronicle his corporal travels as well as his artistic growth.Pomerans (1997), xxiii Sometimes Vincent wrote Theo every day—beyond the need to acknowledge financial support, describing England and the Netherlands. He included in the letters sketches of common people, such as miners and farmers, for he believed the poor would inherit the earth. Van Gogh's spiritual and theological thought and convictions are revealed in his letters throughout his life.

Letter 902, written on July 23 1890, is the last found letter written by van Gogh who passed away on July 29 1890 in Auvers-sur-Oise.  Commentaries from critics and friends  For much of his adult life he was lonely and pushed to learn as much as he could about the world around and about his craft. Margaret Drabble describes the letters from Drenthe as \\"heart-breaking\\", as he struggled to come to terms with the \\"darkness of his hereditary subject matter\\", the bleak poverty and meanness of Dutch peasant life. This struggle culminated with his painting The Potato Eaters. His friend and mentor Van Rappard disliked the painting. Undeterred, van Gogh moved south, via Antwerp and Paris. His letters from Arles describe his utopian dream of establishing a community of artists who lived together, worked together, and helped each other. In this project he was joined by Paul Gauguin in late 1888.  Autograph of letter 716  Letter 716: Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Emile Bernard. Arles, Thursday, 1 or Friday, 2 November 1888 Letter 716 is a letter sent jointly by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Émile Bernard around 1 November 1888 shortly after Gauguin had joined van Gogh in Arles. Late that summer, van Gogh had completed his second group of Sunflower paintings, among his most iconic paintings, two of which decorated Gauguin's room, as well as his famous painting The Yellow House depicting the house they shared. The letter is unique in being a joint letter from the two, and can be read in both the original French and an English translation at the website of the Van Gogh Museum's edition of the letters. In it they discuss, among other matters, their plans to form an artists' commune, possibly abroad. In reality their relationship was always fraught, and by the end of the year they had parted for good, van Gogh himself hospitalised following a breakdown in which he had mutilated one of his ears. The autograph fetched €445,000 at a sale in Paris 12–13 December 2012.  In popular media  The delivery of Vincent's final letter to Theo after Vincent's death and the circumstances surrounding his death was the subject of the 2017 film Loving Vincent, which was animated by oil paintings made with van Gogh's techniques.

He was educated at the Kaitokudō academy founded by members of the mercantile class of Osaka, but was ostracised shortly after the age of 15. Tominaga belonged to a Japanese rationalist school of thought and advocated a Japanese variation of atheism, mukishinron (no gods or demons). He was also a merchant in Osaka. Only a few of his works survive; his Setsuhei (\\"Discussions on Error\\") has been lost and may have been the reason for his separation from the Kaitokudō, and around nine other works' titles are known.Kato 1967, pg183 The surviving works are his Okina no Fumi (\\"The Writings of an Old Man\\"),\\"The Writings of an Old Man\\", translator Kato Shuichi, 1967 Shutsujō Kōgo (\\"Words after Enlightenment\\"; on textual criticism of Buddhist sutras), and three other works on ancient musical scales, ancient measurements, and poetry. He took a deep critical stance against normative systems of thought, partially based on the Kaitokudō's emphasis on objectivity, but was clearly heterodox in eschewing the dominant philosophies of the institution. He was critical of Buddhism, Confucianism and Shintoism.Tetsuo Najita, Visions of Virtue, ChicagoL UOC Press, pp102-106. Whereas each of these traditions drew on history as a source of authority, Tominaga saw appeals to history as a pseudo-justification for innovations that try to outdo other sects vying for power. For example, he cited the various Confucian Masters who saw human nature as partially good, neither good nor bad, all good, and inherently bad; analysing later interpreters who tried to incorporate and reconcile all Masters. He criticised Shintoism as obscurantist, especially in its habit of secret instruction. As he always said, \\"hiding is the beginning of lying and stealing\\".Hajime Nakamura, Ways of Thinking of Eastern People: India, China, Tibet, Japan In his study of Buddhist scriptures, he asserted that Hinayana school of scriptures preceded Mahayana scriptures but also asserted that the vast majority of Hinayana scriptures are also composed much later than the life of Gautama Buddha, the position which was later supported by modern scriptural studies. His work represents an early and indigenous example of Buddhist studies and reflects awareness of Manichaeism and its possible relationship with Buddhism. While Michael Pye has argued that Tominaga represents a non-European example of religious studies, this view has been challenged by Jason Josephson, who argues that Tominaga does not treat non-Buddhist traditions as systematic religions.

He was a member of the Order of St. Vladimir and of the Legion of Honour. Early life and education Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius was born in Mühlhausen (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) on 17 July 1769. His father was a merchant and actuary and his mother the daughter and sister of surgeons. It was his mother's brother who introduced the young Tilesius to the natural sciences and drawing. In 1790 Tilesius began studies of natural sciences and medicine at the University of Leipzig, and at the same time took drawing lessons from Adam Friedrich Oeser at the art academy in the Pleissenburg. He completed his master's degree of arts in 1795, graduated as a doctor of philosophy in 1797, and in 1801 as a doctor of medicine. In 1795-96 he traveled with the earl and scientist Johann Centurius Hoffmannsegg by ship to Portugal. On this trip he studied marine animals, as well as the teaching and practice of medicine in Portugal. The results were published in several papers. Appointment in Moscow and role in Russian circumnavigation Tilesius's 1813 illustration, A warrior of Nuku Hiva with a spear and a hand fan (the expedition spent 12 days on Nuku Hiva) In 1803 he was appointed professor at Moscow University. He participated as a ship's doctor, marine biologist and expedition artist on the frigate Nadezhda in the first Russian circumnavigation of the globe during 1803-1806 under Adam Johann von Krusenstern. The Nadezhda departed from Kronstadt on the Baltic Sea, with Tlesius joining the expedition at Copenhagen; included among his baggage were a violin and viola, which he played on the voyage. The Nadezhda sailed past the Canary Islands and Brazil, around Cape Horn and across the Pacific Ocean to Japan, stopping at the Marquesas and Hawaiian islands, and also at Kamchatka. After visiting Japan, the Nadezhda set off towards Alaska, then sailed past China to the Indian Ocean, around Africa and back to the Baltic. Tilesius made numerous sketches and watercolors during the trip, particularly after the official artist departed in Japan. Honors Tilesius received on his return included being made a knight in the Order of St. Vladimir, corresponding membership of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, and a lifetime pension of 300 rubles per year. His illustrated report on the expedition appeared in 1814. However, he did not win public recognition like his contemporary, Alexander von Humboldt. Later life Tilesius's etching of the Adams mammoth skeleton now on display in the Museum of Zoology, Saint Petersburg. On 12 May 1807 he married Olympia von Sitzky, 20 years his junior, daughter of a Polish nobleman. A son Adolf was born the following year, but they were separated in 1809. One of his projects while in Russia was to reconstruct the skeleton of the Adams mammoth, a woolly mammoth whose nearly intact frozen carcass was excavated from the Siberian permafrost in 1806. This represented one of the earliest attempts to reconstruct the skeleton of an extinct animal. (Tilesius made one notable error in this effort, exchanging the tusks so that they diverged instead of converged.) In 1814, Tilesius returned from Russia to his hometown of Mühlhausen and put his son in the care of his grandmother. He continued to lecture and publish on zoological, medical and ethnographic subjects, and attained membership in a number of scientific societies across Europe and in the United States, but did not obtain another academic position. He spent most of the rest of his life in Mühlhausen and Leipzig, and died in Mühlhausen (by then part of Prussia) in 1857.

The right-wing conservative victory reversed the results which came during the previous 2011 French senate election, which was the first time since the foundation of the Fifth Republic in 1958 that the upper house of the French government had been won by a majority of left-wing candidates. Following the victory of the UMP, Gérard Larcher was nominated and subsequently elected to the position of president of the senate, taking the place of Jean-Pierre Bel who had served in the position following the Socialist Party’s senate victory in 2011. The Far-right National Front party also claimed its first two seats in the senate election, which their leader Marine Le Pen described as \\"a historic victory\\".  Background   Political Context  Elections for the National Assembly were held on the 10th and 17th of June 2012. The Socialist Party combined with its allies to win 331 out of a potential 577 seats. These seats were composed of the Socialist Party winning 280 seats, the Greens winning 17, the Radical Party of the Left winning 12, and the Miscellaneous Left winning 22 seats. Results from the other parties saw the UMP win 194 seats, the Miscellaneous Right win 15, the New-Centre win 12, the Left-Front win 10, the Radical Party win 9, and other Independents win 6. France held municipal elections on 23 March 2014, in which the results saw the Socialist Party lose control of 155 towns. Overall, the Socialist Party won 40% of the votes, which was only slightly above the record high abstention rate of 36%. Following the results of the municipal election, French President François Hollande announced that he would be changing the Prime Minister in his administration. The French Prime Minister at the time, Jean-Marc Ayrault, promptly resigned publicly on the 31st of March 2014, and was subsequently replaced by Manuel Valls on the 1st of April 2014. On 23 August 2014, one month prior to the French senate election, the French economy minister Arnaud Montebourg criticised President Hollande, citing that France \\"shouldn't be aligning itself with the obsessions of the German right\\". The education minister Benoit Hamon also voiced his criticism of Hollande's government. These criticisms arose during a time of low growth for France, during which unemployment was 11%, and economic growth was 0.5%. In response, President Hollande tasked Valls with forming a new government more in line with the government's administration. Valls pledged that the new administration would focus on deficit cuts, and pro-business tax reforms. These movements created a divide in the Socialist party, as an increasing number of ministers under Hollande's government agreed with Montebourg’s views. Numerous centre-right politicians also called for Montebourg to step down from his position as economy minister.  Candidates  The 2014 French senate election saw 1,733 candidates run for 178 available seats in the senate. This was the highest number of recorded candidates to date, compared to 1,374 candidates in 2011, and 754 candidates in 2008, showing an increase of roughly 25% from 2011-14. 118 candidates were running for their second consecutive term in the senate. Women made up 42% of candidates, which was slightly lower than the record of 43% set in the 2004 senate election. The youngest and oldest candidates were 24 and 88 years old respectively, with the average age being 55 years old. The French senate has 348 total seats, which had risen from 343 in 2011 to reflect an increase in the total national population.  Election Process  French Senatorial terms are six years in length, with roughly half of the total 348 positions being renewed every three years. Senators are elected for the country's 101 electoral areas, or departments, in which the number of available seats in each department loosely corresponds to the size of the area. Senators are chosen through elected officials, this including regional and city councillors, mayors, and members of the French National Assembly. Members of the general public do not vote for senate candidates. The elected officials for the 2014 senate election total at 87,092, with municipal council delegates making up approximately 95.5% of all votes. General councillors and regional advisers make up 2.7% and 1.2% of delegates respectively, with the remaining 0.6% being senators and deputies.  Influential Factors  François Hollande, the French President at the time of the 2014 senate election Hollande and his socialist government faced heavy criticism as France struggled economically from 2013-14, leading to a period of zero economic growth, high unemployment, an increasing budget deficit, and higher taxes for the French people. Hollande's former partner, Valerie Trierweiler, also described him as power hungry and disdainful towards the poor. This all contributed to a poor public perception of Hollande, leading to him being the most unpopular president in modern French history with a record low approval rating of 13% in 2014. These factors then led to forecasts of a humiliating Socialist Party defeat in the senate.  Results  The Conservative UMP and its allies in the Centrist Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) claimed 188 seats in the senate election, exceeding the number needed for an absolute majority by 13 seats. The UMP also made net gains of 14 seats, ending with a total of 144, in contrast to the Socialist Party who lost 17 seats, to finish with a grand total of 111. Centre and far left Socialist Allies also lost 9 seats while keeping 30 total, and the Greens were able to retain all 10 of their seats in the senate. Following the results 77% of seats in the senate were taken by men, and 23% were occupied by women. The Far-right National Front (FN) party was able to claim two seats in the senate for the first time, as senators Stéphane Ravier and David Rachline were elected in the Bouches-du-Rhône region and Var respectively. Senator David Rachline at 26 years old is the youngest French senator ever elected to date. These victories by the FN enabled the political breakthrough of their leader, Marine Le Pen, as she attempted to redefine the public image of the FN, following the departure of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, from the party in 2011. The National Front was able to capitalise on recent success it found in local elections, including topping the European parliament vote in May 2014. Ravier also commented on the FN party’s victory, stating that, \\"There is only one door left for us to push and it is that of the Élysée [presidential palace]\\". The election of senators Teura Iriti and Vincent Dubois, who were elected in French Polynesia, were annulled by the French constitutional court, after it was found that supporters of the presiding Tahoeraa Huiraatira Party had marched to polling stations, consequently placing excessive pressure on the electoral college. A new election was then scheduled on the 3rd of May 2015, in which Nuihua Laurey and Lana Tetuanui were instead elected to the French senate.  Senate Presidency  Gérard Larcher, who successfully won the position of Senate President in 2014, Jean-Pierre Bel resided as president of the senate following the Socialist Party's victory in the senate in 2011. He decided not to stand for re-election in 2014 and consequently stood down from his position as president, along with 57 other senators who did not run again for seats they already held in the senate. Bel did not run again for his seat in Ariége. Prior to the election, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Gérard Larcher, and Philippe Marini were all touted as potential successors for the position of the senate president, all of them from the UMP. Following the 2014 election and the new right-wing majority, Gérard Larcher became the new president of the senate, a position which he had previously occupied from 2008-2011, when the UMP had controlled the senate. Larcher received 145 votes, which was slightly above Didier Guillaume of the Socialist Party, who received 112 votes. Phillippe Marini received only 1 vote during the presidency election process.  Gérard Larcher  Gérard Larcher first ran for the position of president of the senate in 2008, in which he was nominated against former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. Larcher won, receiving 173 votes. Jean- Pierre Bel received 134 votes, and other UMP candidates René Garrec and Jean- Pierre Raffarin received 19 and 2 votes respectively. In the 2011 senate election, the Socialist party and their allies won 177 seats, compared to 171 won by the right and centre-right. The loss of the senate to the left preceded Larcher’s eventual removal from the position of Presidency.  Jean-Pierre Bel  Jean-Pierre Bel was successfully voted in as Senate President on 2 October 2011 following the French senate election in 2011. Bel was elected in with 179 votes, just ahead of Gérard Larcher who received 134 votes, and centrist senator Valérie Létard who received 29 votes. Bel also ran for president of the senate in 2008. He received 134 votes but was defeated by Larcher's 173 votes.  Jean-Pierre Raffarin  Jean-Pierre Raffarin served as the vice president of the senate from 2011 to 2014. He was first elected to a position in the senate in 1995 in the region of Vienne, and was appointed to the position of Prime Minister in 2002 by the president at the time, Jacques Chirac. He attempted to become president of the senate in 2008 but was unsuccessful, as he was unable to secure the backing of the UMP, which Gérard Larcher instead received. Despite rumours of a potential run for senate president in 2014, he did not end up putting himself forward for the position.  Ramifications in French Politics  The right-wing victory by the UMP in the senate helped former president Nicolas Sarkozy in his attempts to return to head the UMP, as it provided momentum through which he was able to build his position within the party. The result also exacerbated the public’s negative sentiment towards the Socialist Party, as opinion polls following the senate election projected Marine Le Pen beating François Hollande in the 2017 presidential election. Additionally, the Socialist defeat in the senate further impeded progress of Hollande's economic plans for the nation, despite the Socialist Party still controlling the National Assembly at the time. By March 2016 the senate composition had varied slightly. The senate was made up of 144 seats from The Republicans (the UMP renamed themselves to The Republicans in 2015), 109 from the Socialist Party, 42 from the UDI, 19 from the Communist Republic and Citizen Group, 17 from the Democratic and Social European Rally, 11 from the Ecologist Group, and 6 others. The Republicans were projected to consolidate their majority in the 2017 senate election. The centrist Republic on the Move! party were consequently forced to attempt to ally themselves with centrists and moderate republicans, as the results of the 2014 senate election meant they were unable to rely on a left-wing senate majority in order to pass their pro-business reforms.

The mineral can be found in phosphatic shales and was first discovered in the Big Fish River area in Yukon Territory, Canada. Satterlyite is part of the phosphate mineral group. Satterlyite is a transparent, light brown to light yellow mineral with a density of 3.68 g/cm3. The structure of satterlyite is made up of two pairs of face shared, distorted (Fe,Mg)O6 octahedra, linked together by sharing edges to form double chains along the [001] plain. The first satterlyite mineral was discovered in the Big Fish River area in Yukon Territory, westernmost of Canada; by a geologist at Ontario Department of Mines in Canada, Jack Satterly, and the mineral was also named after him (Kolitsch, 2002). Composition Satterlyite has a formula of (Fe2+,Mg,Fe3+)2(PO4)(OH). Studies using the optical absorption spectra show that satterlyite has similar features to different iron bearing minerals with Fe(III) and Fe(II) impurities. EPR studies were also made on the mineral first by turning the satterlyite mineral fine powder then putting it into an EPR quartz tube for measurements. The results from the EPR show a strong line on g=2.0 and another line on g=8.0, thus also showing a presence of ferrous and ferric ions in satterlyite. Structure Satterlyite is hydroxyl bearing iron phosphate with a space group P31m. The structure of satterlyite is made up of two pairs of face shared, distorted (Fe,Mg)O6 octahedra, the two faces are linked together by sharing edges to form double chains along the [001] plain. The double chains share ligands with six other double chains to make a 3D network holding three PO4 tetrahedra, linked by the corners to the (Fe,Mg)O6 octahedra (Kolitsch, 2002). The two (Fe,Mg)O6 Octahedra have different occupancies; the Fe to Mg ratio of the M sites are 0.838(2):0.162(2) for the M(1) site and 0.706(2):0.294(2) for the M(2) site (Kolitsch, 2002). The structure contains three H atoms; two are share ligands with two (Fe,Mg)O6 octahedra and the third strongly disordered H atom is bonded to O of the PO4 tetrahedron (Kolitsch, 2002). Holtedahlite, a mineral that was found in Tingelstadtjern quarry in Norway, with the formula (Mg12PO4)5(PO3OH,CO3)(OH,O)6 is isostructural with satterlyite (Raade, 1979). Infrared absorption powder spectra show that satterlyite is different from natural haltedahlite in that there is no carbonate for phosphate substitution (Kolitsch, 2002). Satterlyite is also structurally related to phosphoellenbergerite, a mineral that was discovered in Modum, Norway; near San Giocomo Vallone Di Gilba, in Western Alps of Italy (Palache, 1951); the minerals formula is Mg14(PO4)5(PO3OH)2(OH)6 (Kolitsch, 2002). EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) and optical absorption studies have investigated the iron phosphate mineral satterlyite and gormanite. Results of the optical studies show that both minerals have ferrous and ferric ions (Chandrasekhar, 2003). These studies also show that the site symmetry of Fe(III) in satterlyite is tetragonally distorted. However, the Fe(II) ions is tetragonally distorted octahedral (Chandrasekhar, 2003). The complex structure of satterlyite is made up of two pairs of face shared, distorted (Fe,Mg)O6 octahedra, linked together by sharing edges to form double chains along [001]. Physical properties Satterlyite has a light brown to light yellow color with a light yellow streak and a hardness of 4.5 to 5. It has no trigonal (ditrigonal pyramidal) crystal symmetry with a space group P3*1m and no cleavage (Mandarino, 1978). The parameters of the mineral are a=11.35 Å and c=5.04 Å and the ratio of a to c is 1:0.444 and a cell volume 562.28 Å3 (Mindat, 2011). The mineral is found as one of three habits; aggregated (when the mineral is made up of many individual crystals or clusters), nodular (grows as a circle around the center) or radial (the crystal radiates outwards from the center of a common point on the mineral) (Mineralogy Database, 2011). Geologic occurrence Jack Satterly, a geologist at Ontario Department of Mines in Canada, discovered satterlyite in nodules in shale in the Big Fish River (Mandarino, 1978). These nodules were about 10 cm in diameter, some would consist of satterlyite only and others would show satterlyite with quartz, pyrite, wolfeite or maricite. The Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names approved the name of the mineral (Mandarino, 1978). The type specimen is now preserved at the Royal Ontario Museum (Mandarino, 1978).

It is the only species in its genus. It is found in fresh water at pelagic depths in a tropical climate. The average length of an unsexed male is about 6.1 cm (2.4 in). It has an elongated body with large eyes. It is a timid species compared to other similar species such as the various pencilfish. They live near the surface of water and are known to hide whenever possible, usually under floating objects. This species only eats what can be found at the surface, as well. D. hoffmannorum will not seek food that sinks to the bottom.

Vancouver fireman jumping into life net (1910) A life net, also known as a Browder Life Safety Net or jumping sheet, is a type of rescue equipment formerly used by firefighters. When used in the proper conditions, it allowed people on upper floors of burning buildings an opportunity to jump to safety, usually to ground level. Invented in 1887, the device was used with varying degrees of success during several notable fires in the 20th century. Due to advances in firefighting technology, it became obsolete by the 1980s. Owing to their former prevalence, life nets often feature in popular culture as a running gag, especially in cartoons where they often appear in use during scenes where a fire is taking place. Inventor The device was invented by Thomas F. Browder, born in Greene County, Ohio, in 1847. During the American Civil War, Browder enlisted in the Company C, 60th Ohio Infantry of the Union Army at the age of 17, and was wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House on May 9, 1864. He was shot through the hip, sent home the following month, and later discharged from the service. He became a school teacher, and later moved to Greenfield, Ohio, where he invented and patented the life net in 1887. Browder later opened a laundry business. He obtained additional patents for improvements to the life net in 1900, and later also patents in Europe. Design Browder's device was similar to a modern recreational trampoline, which was developed later in 1936. Among its advantages were that the life net was always taut when open, never slackened, and had a setup time of only two to three seconds. It used hinges to fold for storage and an automatic locking mechanism when unfolded. Its opaque cover helped reduce panic and increase the confidence of people who had to jump into it. The device helped save many lives. Some models had a red bullseye in the center. Limitations Firefighters believed that the practical height limit for successful use of life nets was about six stories, although in a 1930 Chicago fire, three people survived jumps from an eighth story into a life net. One suffered a skull fracture, and the other two had minor injuries. Successful rescues Life-net used in Ringtheater fire in Vienna December 8, 1851 On August 19, 1902, the New York City Fire Department conducted its first real- life rescue with the Browder life net. During rescue operations at a tenement fire that killed five people, a baby was dropped from a fourth-floor fire escape into a life net, and survived uninjured. On November 10, 1904, three people were saved when they jumped into a life net during a fire in New York City. Three other people died on the top floor of the building. In Anchorage, Alaska, in 1957, a woman dropped her three-year-old daughter into a life net, and the girl was uninjured; the mother suffered a broken back after jumping into the net. Failures and problems Life nets often failed to save people, and sometimes firefighters themselves were injured or killed by falling bodies. According to researcher and writer Cecil Adams, \\"Leapers sometimes struck something on the way down, landed on a fireman, or missed entirely.\\" In November 1910, a fire swept through a factory in Newark, New Jersey, killing 25 people. Among them were four girls who held onto each other when they jumped into a life net. They tore the net apart and were killed. In the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25, 1911, girls jumped into life nets from the ninth floor with their arms intertwined and the impact ripped the canvas and tore the springs from the frame, resulting in their deaths. In all, 146 garment workers were killed in that fire. During the Hotel Polen fire in Amsterdam on May 9, 1977, firefighters could not successfully deploy a life net in a narrow, congested alley. When a life net was deployed in a more open area, some hotel guests threw their luggage into the net, and were then injured when they jumped. Others were injured when they hit the rim of the net. In all, 33 people died in that fire. Phase out Telescopic hydraulic platform in Roskilde, Denmark (2007) In 1958, a fire department official in Eugene, Oregon expressed reservations, saying that the term \\"life net\\" was misleading, and that they should be used only as a last resort. As late as 1961, though, the Chicago Fire Department still emphasized the life net in its training programs. However, the modern aerial apparatus (a type of aerial work platform) often known as a ladder truck has made the life net obsolete, as this ladder equipment makes it possible for firefighters to carry out rescues more safely, at greater heights and with smaller crews. Another piece of equipment, which started to phase out the life net (especially in European countries, such as Austria and Germany) are inflatable jumping cushions, which absorb the energy of a person due to the air inside the cushion being forced out by the impact. Adams has concluded that the life net was no longer mentioned after 1983, and writes that they are not discussed in current training manuals for firefighters. Many examples of life nets are on display in firefighting historical museums. References External links *My.FirefighterNation.com: Fire Department Safety Nets...

The 26 kilometre line is currently closed, although there is a campaign to reopen it. Geography  The line runs in the west through the flat, mostly agricultural landscape known as geest. In the east it reaches Holstein Switzerland, which is dominated by lakes and terminal moraines. History  Closed bridge over the Dosenbek in Neumünster, looking towards the city (2010) The Neumünster–Ascheberg–Eutin–Neustadt line was opened on 31 May 1866. The line was operated by the Altona-Kiel Railway Company (, AKE), which was nationalised in 1884. In railway timetables, the line was soon shown in three sections. From Ascheberg (Holst) to Eutin it was considered part of the Kiel–Lübeck railway. The easternmost section from Eutin to Neustadt was now managed as a separate line (the Eutin–Neustadt railway). From 1912 to 1961 the line was crossed on a bridge by the Kiel-Segeberg Light Railway (Kleinbahn Kiel–Segeberg) in Wankendorf. The lines were not connected. The line was operated almost continuously with both passenger and freight traffic. The longest passenger services operated from the 1950s to the 1970s as a single daily pair of services between Büsum and Eutin and later between Heide and Neustadt. Both routes crossed almost the full width of Schleswig-Holstein. In the 1970s, these fast passenger trains were operated mostly with class 515 accumulator railcars. They stopped between Neumünster and Ascheberg (Holst) only in Wankendorf and recorded a travel time of 20 minutes on this section, while the local trains took about 28 minutes. These trains mostly ran as railcars, but some were locomotive-hauled. Some passenger trains were bound for places off the main route. On 29 September 1985 passenger rail transport were abandoned between Neumünster and Ascheberg (Holst). Thus, to this time (2010), the line was the second last in Schleswig-Holstein to be closed for passengers (in 1988, passenger services on the Wilster-Brunsbüttel branch line of the Marsh Railway were closed). Freight traffic was abandoned on 1 November 1995. However, the route has not been closed, but was protected until 2007 under a Schleswig-Holstein-wide agreement. However, in 1996, a railway bridge near Ascheberg (Holst) station was demolished and the connecting points were altered. The connection from the tracks towards Neumünster have been partly built over. In October 2006, the barriers at the Christianstraße crossing in Neumünster have been dismantled and on both sides of the road a fence has been built over the tracks. The bridge over the Dosenbek river in the Brachenfelder Gehölz is blocked by a railing. Also the bridge close to Ascheberg (Holst) station has been demolished. Draisine rides operate between Bokhorst and Wankendorf. Bus line 360 of the Verkehrsbetriebe Kreis Plön runs from Plön to Neumünster, connecting the towns formerly served by the line.

It is situated on a hill above the town of Coburg, in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria. Geography Location Veste Coburg dominates the town of Coburg on Bavaria's border with Thuringia. It is located at an altitude of 464 meters above NHN, or 167 meters above the town. Its size (around 135 meters by 260 meters) present one of the mediums fortresses in Germany. History Early history and Middle Ages The hill on which Veste Coburg stands was inhabited from the Neolithic to the early Middle Ages according to the results of excavations. The first documentary mention of Coburg occurs in 1056, in a gift by Richeza of Lotharingia. Richeza gave her properties to Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, to allow the creation of Saalfeld Abbey in 1071. In 1075, a chapel dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul is mentioned on the fortified Coberg. This document also refers to a Vogt named Gerhart, implying that the local possessions of the Saalfeld Benedictines were administered from the hill. A document signed by Pope Honorius II in 1206 refers to a mons coburg, a hill settlement. In the 13th century, the hill overlooked the town of Trufalistat (Coburg's predecessor) and the important trade route from Nuremberg via Erfurt to Leipzig. A document dated from 1225 uses the term sloss (palace) for the first time. At the time, the town was controlled by the Dukes of Merania (or Meran). They were followed in 1248 by the Counts of Henneberg who ruled Coburg until 1353, save for a period from 1292-1312, when the House of Ascania (Askanien) was in charge. In 1353, Coburg fell to Friedrich, Markgraf von Meißen of the House of Wettin. His successor, Friedrich der Streitbare was awarded the status of Elector of Saxony in 1423. Thus, Coburg – despite being in Franconia – was now referred to as \\"Saxony\\", like other properties of the House of Wettin. As a result of the Hussite Wars the fortifications of the Veste were expanded in 1430. Early modern times through Thirty Years' War In 1485, in the Partition of Leipzig, Veste Coburg fell to the Ernestine branch of the family. A year later, Elector Friedrich der Weise and Johann der Beständige took over the rule of Coburg. Johann used the fortress as a residence from 1499. In 1506/07, Lucas Cranach the Elder lived and worked in the Fortress. From April to October 1530, during the Diet of Augsburg, Martin Luther sought protection at the Fortress, as he was under an Imperial ban at the time. Whilst he stayed at the fortress, Luther continued with his work translating the Bible into German. In 1547, Johann Ernst moved the residence of the ducal family to a more convenient and fashionable location, Ehrenburg Palace in the town center of Coburg. The Veste now only served as a fortification. In the further splitting of the Ernestine line, Coburg became the seat of the Herzogtum von Sachsen-Coburg, the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg. The first duke was Johann Casimir (1564-1633), who modernized the fortifications. In 1632, the fortress was unsuccessfully besieged by Imperial and Bavarian forces commanded by Albrecht von Wallenstein for seven days during the Thirty Years' War. Its defense was commanded by . On 17 March 1635, after a renewed siege of five months' duration, the Veste was handed over to the Imperials under Guillaume de Lamboy. 17th through 19th centuries The fortress as it looked in the late 19th century or early 20th century From 1638 to 1672, Coburg and the fortress were part of the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg. In 1672, they passed to the Dukes of Saxe-Gotha and in 1735 it was joined to the Duchy of Saxe-Saalfeld. Following the introduction of Primogeniture by Duke Franz Josias (1697-1764), Coburg went by way of Ernst Friedrich (1724-1800) to Franz (1750-1806), noted art collector, and to Duke Ernst III (1784-1844), who remodeled the castle. In 1826, the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was created and Ernst now styled himself \\"Ernst I\\". Military use of the fortress had ceased by 1700 and outer fortifications had been demolished in 1803-38. From 1838-60, Ernst had the run-down fortress converted into a Gothic revival residence. In 1860, use of the Zeughaus as a prison (since 1782) was discontinued. Through a successful policy of political marriages, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha established links with several of the major European dynasties, including that of the United Kingdom. 20th century The dynasty ended with the reign of Herzog Carl Eduard (1884-1954), also known as Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a grandson of Queen Victoria, who until 1919 also was the 2nd Duke of Albany in the United Kingdom. Under his rule, many changes made to the Veste Coburg in the 19th century were reversed under architect Bodo Ebhardt, with the aim of restoring a more authentic medieval look. Along with the other ruling princes of Germany, Carl Eduard was deposed in the revolution of 1918-1919. After Carl Eduard abdicated in late 1918, the fortress came into possession of the state of Bavaria, but the former duke was allowed to live there until his death. The works of art collected by the family were gifted to the Coburger Landesstiftung, a foundation, which today runs the museum (see below). In 1945, the fortress was seriously damaged by artillery fire in the final days of World War II. After 1946, renovation works were undertaken by the new owner, the Bavarian Administration of State-owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes. Today Redwood (sequoiadendron giganteum) near the portal Veste Coburg is open to the public and today houses museums, including a collection of art objects and paintings that belonged to the ducal family of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a large collection of arms and armor, significant examples of early modern coaches and sleighs, and important collections of prints, drawings and coins.

This can be done gradually, which can create many problems with transitional incompatibilities, or overnight, which requires much planning.  By region   Europe  The European network has traditionally been formed of many independent national railway networks with buffer and chain used near universally to allow the interchange of rolling stock. The European Union Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) for high-speed passenger rolling stock mandate the use of Scharfenberg Type 10-compatible couplings. The Type 10 includes \\"horns\\" to aid coupling on curves and include a function to provide standardised automatic air-brake connections; the coupling horn is often visible poking out at the front of the nose of high-speed trains. For European freight, the TSIs mandate buffer and chain couplings at specified heights. The European system links to the former Soviet Russian-gauge network, where SA3 automatic couplers are used. Some research has been undertaken to choose an automatic freight coupler compatible with the Soviet one, but owing to widescale replacement cost, no action has been taken to implement the conversion, except for some trial installations. In many heavy-haul applications, such as for coal and iron ore, either US AAR-type couplers or Soviet SA-3 couplers are used. Conversion is made harder to justify because the existing buffer and chain coupling is almost universal. Meanwhile, drawgear of new rolling stock is being built at a height suitable for conversion. The proposed European C-AKv freight coupler is compatible with the SA3 coupler but adds integrated air and electrical connections. This standard would need to be revised to allow for the unforeseen development of electronically controlled pneumatic brakes. In Germany all freight wagon have been built with a UIC automatic coupler option since 1976. This mounting option can be used to deploy the C-Akv coupler when a conversion is implemented. A further advantage in such a scenario is, that the C-Akv coupler can also function like the hook and air connectors for a hook-and-chain coupler, ad long as the vehicle with the C-Akv coupler still has buffers.  Soviet Union and successor states  Russian Empire and later Soviet Union used buffer and chain couplings, albeit with possibly wider centres for the buffers, until conversion to automatic SA3 couplers. The SA3 coupler was invented in 1932. Some wagons were equipped with SA-3 couplers in the 1930s (they could be coupled with chain coupling), but all cars received automatic couplers in 1957.Intermat/Willison coupler:ru:Автосцепка СА-3 (in Russian)  United States  Once Congress passed the Safety Appliance Act in 1893, mandating conversion from the link and pin coupler to the Janney coupler, railroads in the United States had only a few years to implement the change. The railroads in North America, except for mass transit, form one unitary system, and uniformity of couplers is important for smooth interchange of rolling stock.  Latin America  Railways in Central and South America are fragmented by gauge, geography, and financial and technical heritage. While some systems have adopted the American Janney coupler, others retain the British buffer and hook (buffer and chain) coupler (see above).  Japan  Japan converted its British-derived buffer and chain couplings to the American Janney coupling over a period of a few daysHonshū, 17 July 1925 and Kyūshū, 20 July 1925. in the early 1920s,Except Hokkaido, using Janney coupler from the early 20th century. after considerable preparation. Today, most (if not all) EMUs including high-speed Shinkansen trains, and some DMUs use the Shibata type coupling system, while locomotive-hauled trains use the Janney coupling and Tightlock coupling system.  Australia  Australia, with its breaks of gauge, has always had different couplers on different systems, and has generally adopted gradual conversion. Conversion to the Janney coupling is now virtually complete. Commonwealth Railways started with Janney couplings on its Trans-Australian line, and some railways, like the former Victorian Railways and the Queensland Railways, used dual couplers. Older couplers remain on Heritage railways.  Middle East  While the Middle East is mostly standard gauge, three different couplings appear to be in use (not counting Scharfenberg couplings on EMU trains). These are buffer-and-chain, American, and Russian types.  Africa  South of the Sahara, Janney (AAR) and chopper couplings (not necessarily of compatible types) appear to account for most couplings. The preferred and proposed UAR standard is the American Janney (AAR) coupling.Ghana See also * Railway coupling by country Notes References Category:Couplers ","title":"Railway coupling conversion"},{"id":"34020348","text":"The 2011 Zumpango earthquake occurred at with a moment magnitude of 6.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). Its epicenter was located in the city Zumpango, Guerrero, roughly equidistant between the metropolitan areas of Mexico City and Acapulco. The quake was felt in Guerrero, Michoacán, Mexico State, Mexico City and Puebla. Multiple deaths and injuries resulted from the earthquake, although the effects were minimized because the hypocenter was relatively deep at 65 kilometers. The resulting damage was minimal, but during the panic people evacuated buildings in Mexico City. Impact In Mexico City, a little more than 100 miles from the epicenter, high rise buildings swayed for more than one minute as a result of the seism. Damage was reported as light though a secondary toll highway between Acapulco and Mexico City was blocked in several places due to landslides. The shaking was also responsible for knocking out power to around 82,000 people, and disrupting cell phone service in the capital. In Acapulco, 87 miles from the epicenter, no injuries or damage were reported. It was reported by Mexico City's mayor, Marcelo Ebrard, that normal operations were continuing at Mexico City International Airport. USGS shakemap for the event Casualties Several injuries and one death was reported after rocks were dislodged from a hill and tumbled onto the Autopista del Sol (Highway of the Sun) and into a truck. The other deaths were reported as one person killed during the collapse of a house's roof in Iguala, and another was listed in Ixcateopan de Cuauhtémoc with unknown circumstances. Aftermath An early report from the United States Geological Survey had the magnitude at 6.7 but it was later lowered to 6.5. According to the Secretariat of the Interior there were four aftershocks within the first 45 minutes of the main shock. Also stated was that since this was a moderate event a large number of aftershocks were not expected. Seven of the aftershocks were close to the epicenter and two more were in the state of Chiapas. Although the event occurred in the coastal state of Guerrero, no tsunami warning was given for the earthquake. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration stated that based on the location, magnitude, and historical tsunami records, no advisory or warning would be necessary for the west coast of the United States, British Columbia, or Alaska.

H. Hay Block is an historic commercial building at Free and Cross Streets in downtown Portland, Maine. Built in 1848 and enlarged in 1919 to a design by John Calvin Stevens, it is one of the city's finer surviving Greek Revival commercial buildings. The block was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in March 1977. Description and history The Byron Greenough Block occupies a triangular parcel of land between Federal and Free Streets in downtown Portland. To its east is a pedestrian area that once carried Middle Street, running southeast from Federal to Free. The building is a four-story masonry structure, built out of brick with granite trim. Its principal facade faces the pedestrian area, and is five bays wide, while a single bay marks the triangular point, while the more utilitarian southern facade, facing Free Street, is ten bays wide. The main facade has modern storefronts on the ground floor, with a framing of granite pilasters and lintels. Windows on the upper floors have granite sills and lintels, and there are a series of brick stringcourses (part of the original building cornice) between the third and fourth floors. The current cornice has brick dentil relief and a projecting wooden overhang. The block was built in 1848 by Byron Greenough, who made his wealth in hatting and clothier, and ran his business here until 1856. The building notably escaped Portland's 1866 fire, and is consequently one of its few surviving Greek Revival commercial buildings. For many years its retail space on the ground floor housed the H.H. Hay drugstore. The architecture firm Stevens and Stevens designed and added the fourth floor.

Albiker studied with Auguste Rodin in Paris. From 1919 to 1945 he was a professor at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. His monumental statues, like those of Georg Kolbe, reflected National Socialist heroic realism. Albiker created the relay racers for Berlin's Reich Sports Field and various war monuments, including those in Karlsruhe, Freiburg im Breisgau, and Greiz. Minerva, 1931 (see below as well) Entry of the Church of Christ in Mannhein Biography Albiker was a college student at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe; after college he was a friend of, among others, the expressionist painter Karl Hofer. During the years 1899 and 1900 he attended the Académie Julian in Paris and the studio of Antoine Bourdelle. In Paris he met his admired sculptor Auguste Rodin, who became his teacher with time. Later Karl Albiker lived for a time in Munich (1900–1903), and then took a study trip to Rome (1903–1905). In 1905 he moved into a home studio in Ettlingen. The award of the Villa Romana prize in 1910 allowed him to stay in Florence, where he met the philosopher Leopold Ziegler, who dedicated to Albiker his work on art entitled Florentinische Introduktion (1911). In 1919 the artist Albiker was a professor at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and was hired by the local art school. He was one of the important teachers of these schools, and in 1927 he founded both the Secession of Baden and the New Munich Secession. The National Socialist government, attracted by their involvement in architectural projects, used sculptors such as Karl Albiker, Richard Scheibe and Joseph Wackerle, who had already made names for themselves in the 1920s, during the creation of large sculptures for the public and for administrative buildings, including the reconstruction project of the Berlin Forum on Sport, the Reichssportfeld. Albiker was commissioned to design the sculptural program collectively, under the supervision of the architect Werner March, who was in charge of the overall design. Albiker in the 1930s formed part of the jury of \\"German art\\". During the bombing of the Second World War, his house and studio were destroyed. In 1947 he returned to his home region of Baden, and established the Karl Albiker Foundation, through which, his own works and those of his private art collection, including more than 80 works by Karl Hofer, were passed into the possession of the Museum of the City of Ettlingen. Karl Albiker died in 1961 at the age of 82 years in Ettlingen. His son, Carl Albiker (1905–1996), was an art historian and photographer.  Works  In addition to his sculptures for public spaces, Karl Albiker made models for the manufacture of majolica pieces from Karlsruhe (Meissen porcelain). He also designed medals, medallions and lithographs. His works are included in the Gallery of the City of Ettlingen, Ettlingen Castle, and the Municipal Museum of Zwickau, among others. Among his most outstanding works are the following: *The Lament (Die Klage) also known as The Mourner (Die Trauernde) (bronze, height: 137 cm), Hagen, Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum *1925: Pallas Athena – Pallas Athene, monument to those killed in the First World War, at the University of Karlsruhe, Technical SchoolYou can see an image of the sculpture of Pallas Athena at uni-karlsruhe.de :For the same university he made the figure of Fridericiana File:Universitaet Karlsruhe Ehrenhof 1.jpgAthena File:Universitaet Karlsruhe Fridericiana.jpgFridericiana *1926: Christ Figure – Christusfigur, sandstone, above the main entrance of the Church of the Redeemer (Dresden) File:Heilandkirche dresden, main entrance.jpg File:Heilandkirche dresden.jpg *1926: Fallen Soldier – Gefallener Soldat, plastic, monumental sculpture, Greiz, Greiz Park, Rotunda File:Denkmal in der Rotunde Greiz.JPG File:Rotunde Greizer Park.JPG * 1929/31: Hygiene – Hygieia, Dresden, German Hygiene Museum, restored in 1992 by the Dresden sculptor Wilhelm Landgraf (badly damaged by the bombing of Dresden in 1945, the remains were cast in 1952).You can see images of the sculpture at : * 1931: Minerva, Heidelberg, Heidelberg University File:Dem lebendigen Geist (cropped).jpg File:Dem lebendigen Geist.jpg * 1935/37: The Discus Throwers – Die Diskuswerfer, Berlin, Olympic Park, the former Reich Sports Field File:Discus Werfer - geo.hlipp.de - 1753.jpg * 1935/37: The Relay Runners – Die Staffelläufer, Berlin, Olympic Park, the former Reich Sports Field File:Staffettenlaufer (2) - geo.hlipp.de - 1755.jpg File:Staffettenlaufer (3) - geo.hlipp.de - 1794.jpg File:Staffettenlaufer - geo.hlipp.de - 1754.jpg * 1938: The Genius of Flight – Fliegender Genius, frieze, Dresden, on the old building Luftgaukommando IVFor more about the building Luftgaukommando see Luftgaukommando (Dresden) on the German wikipedia File:Dresden-LGK4-Hof.jpg File:Dresden-LGK5-Fries.jpg Awards *1910: Villa Romana prize *1925: Doctor's Honorable Cause (University of Karlsruhe) *1953: Hans Thoma PrizeSee Hans-Thoma-Preis on the German wikipedia *1957: Grand Cross 1st Class (Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany) Exhibitions * 1923: Badische Bildhauer (sculptor of Baden), Mannheim * 1929: Deutscher Werkbund exhibition at Breslau * 7 April–17 May 1937: Deutsche Baukunst und Deutsche Plastik (German Architecture and Sculpture).

He was one of the original founders of the Byrdcliffe Colony in Woodstock, NY, part of what is now referred to as the Woodstock Art Colony. Bolton Brown, Sketch of Mount King, 1896. Before Woodstock: Stanford and the Sierras Brown was born and raised in Dresden, in upstate New York. His sister was the scientific illustrator Anna B. Nash. After receiving his Masters in Painting from Syracuse University, he moved to California in 1891 to create the Art Department at Stanford University. Brown headed the department for almost ten years, but was dismissed in a dispute over his use of nude models in the classroom. Although his own art was heavily influenced by the Tonalist aesthetic, his methods of teaching, which contrasted sharply with the traditional approached at the nearby School of Design in San Francisco, stressed the Impressionist credo of a rapid execution of “natural subjects” in the wilderness. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/10aa/10aa557.htm ). Students often visited his studio-home for discussions on various environmental and political causes. In 1898 Brown designed the studio rooms in Stanford’s new Art Building, which included such “radical” innovations as “one continuous belt of glass” eight feet high and muted terra cotta and gray tones on the walls.The Daily Palo Alto (Stanford University’s student newspaper): 23 September 1898, p.1; 5 October 1898, p.5. The walls were covered with reproductions and original works “by the avant-garde artists of Paris.” One of his more successful students, the painter Jennie V. Cannon, published reviews of his exhibitions and several short biographies which described a quiet, serious and, compassionate teacher with steadfast principles.Berkeley Daily Gazette (Berkeley, CA): 26 February 1921, p.6; 12 March 1921, p.6; 26 March 1921, p.6; 26 July 1924, p.6. Brown was an accomplished mountain climber and benefited from Stanford’s proximity to the Sierra Nevada range, mostly famously explored by John Muir (1838–1914), founder of the Sierra Club, of which Brown was a charter member.Murphy, John. \\"Athletic Aesthetics: Art, Craft and Bolton Brown,\\" Art in Print Vol. 7 No. 2 (July–August 2017). Brown was the first to record climbing a group of peaks in the Sierras with, in two instances, his intrepid wife Lucy; his most challenging first ascent was of Mount Clarence King (also known as Mount King) in August 1896. According to the Climber’s Guide to the High Sierra, Brown’s ascent of Mount King was the first time advanced aid-climbing techniques were used in North America. Nearby Mount Bolton Brown (13,538 ft) is named after him; Brown also named several peaks in the area of Mount King. Bolton Brown, Moonlight Bathers, 1915. Lithograph. Byrdcliffe Brown’s skills as an artist and outdoorsman brought him to the attention of Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead (1854–1929), an aristocratic utopian who developed the concept, and supplied the capital, for the Byrdcliffe Colony. Byrdcliffe was an artists’ colony based on ideals and models provided by John Ruskin (1819–1900) and the English Arts and Crafts movement. Whitehead dispatched Brown on an expedition through the Catskills, scouting locations for three weeks. Brown convinced Whitehead that Woodstock, NY, in the heart of the Catskill Mountains, was where Byrdcliffe should be, although Whitehead had planned on a location further south.Bolton Brown, “Early Days at Woodstock,” published posthumously in 1937, reprinted in Bolton Coit Brown: A Retrospective, exh. cat. (New Paltz: Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art, SUNY, 2003), p. 73 Along with fellow artistic spirit Hervey White, also hired by Whitehead, Brown developed and managed the grounds of Byrdcliffe from 1902–1903, constructing footpaths, plumbing systems and bungalows. But Brown and White were both, ultimately, unable to sustain working relationships with Whitehead. White left of his own accord; Brown, meanwhile, was fired. Although the initial disputes were over budgets and deadlines, Brown later cited his distrust of the \\"medieval\\" intentions Whitehead harbored for the colony. Painter-printmaker Bolton Brown went on to create experimental landscape paintings, migrating between Woodstock and New York City and working within the style that came to be known as Tonalism. He exhibited one painting at the legendary 1913 Armory Show in New York but, despite skill and dedication, never succeeded as a painter. In 1915, an exhibition of the work of Albert Sterner in New York inspired him to turn to lithography, a print-making technique that would ultimately occupy his time and intellect to an almost obsessive degree. After a year of study in England under Francis Ernest Jackson, working devotedly with a press in his rented flat (to the point of grinding his own limestones when necessary), he returned to New York in 1916 and established his own press at 146 East 19th Street. There he earned his greatest fame, printing lithographs for John Sloan, Rockwell Kent, Arthur B. Davies, George William Eggers and well-known Woodstock artist George Bellows, whose premature death in 1925 was both a professional and emotional blow to Brown. In addition to printing these others' work, Brown created over 400 lithographs of his own, with a focus on nature and female nudes; lithographs such as Moonlight Bathers (1915), Cloudy Dawn, (1916) and Sifting Shadows (1916) represent Brown's ability to translate Tonalism from painting into a print medium. Each was printed with great care, signed, and charged for at dearer than average rates, as Bolton cultivated the status of master printer. He promoted the medium indefatigably, along the lines for artists laid out by Ruskin, praising the physical vigor it required and the exquisite control of tone and shading it allowed, but insisting, in the Arts and Crafts tradition, on printers working directly on the limestone during composition. Death Brown died in 1936 in Woodstock, alone and impoverished but by no means unaccomplished. Thinking and working ceaselessly until the end, he left behind an enormous output of lithographs and writings, including books and articles on painting and lithography and 12 volumes of journals documenting his experiments in print-making.John Taylor Arms Papers, Bryn Mawr College Library Special Collections. He is buried in the Woodstock Artists' Cemetery, on a simple birch pallet covered with pine branches under a boulder of his selection.

Design The Arup S-2 featured a straight leading edge wing with a trailing edge that tapered to the rear of the aircraft giving it a guitar pick shape when viewed from above. An M6 airfoil was chosen over its predecessor's sharp edged, modified Clark-Y airfoil. The large trailing edge control surfaces were mixed for pitch and roll control, but were assisted by small, movable, semi-circular wingtips that could provide additional roll control. Conventional landing gear was used, faired with wheel pants. The access to the cockpit was from a belly mounted hatch. Visibility was enhanced with celluloid panels on the aircraft's belly. Operational history The prototype S-2 was test flown by Glen Doolittle. The STOL aircraft could fly at up to 35 degrees angle of attack without stalling. The aircraft was demonstrated across the country at events like the Indianapolis 500 and the 1933 National Air Races. Later it was demonstrated to the Army, NACA and CAA in Washington. D.C. Raoul Hoffman left Arup after the development of the S-2 to create his own design, the Hoffman Flying Wing. Engineer Charles H. Zimmerman viewed the S-2 trials in Washington and later applied the principles to the Vought XF5U program. The S-2 was sold without an engine to a stuntman, F.F. Bowser Frakes, who performed air crashes at fairs. A Szekely radial engine removed from an American Eaglet was installed on the S-2, but did not perform well. A propeller was acquired from Milt Hatfield, who sourced the landing gear for the first S-1. Hatfield demonstrated how to fly the aircraft and it was eventually crashed in a show.

History  Selection boxes were common around the late 19th and early 20th century Britain. Chocolatiers, Rowntree's and Cadbury pioneered the early selection boxes which were saved for by way of a Christmas club over many months, to be collected around Christmas time. Choice and variation of contents were the consumer's choice, and often the value of the selection box would exceed a week's wages. In more modern times the selection box as we know it has become a staple Christmas gift of chocolate. Each chocolate company produces these at Christmas time and they are often filling the spaces near supermarket checkouts. In the 1960s and 1970s the selection box took on a more commercialized approach with games printed on the reverse of the boxes such as snakes and ladders, adding to the desirability of each brand's selection box offering. Children expectantly received a selection box each year and regarded them as a main Christmas gift. More recently the commercial arms of the chocolate companies insist on filling their festive selection boxes with predefined chocolate bar selections, and many a child will receive in excess of six selection boxes each Christmas.  Production  Chocolate selection boxes are sometimes packaged by hand and sometimes by robot. Hand picking is expensive, but early automated systems lacked flexibility; the layout or contents of a box could not be changed without making alterations to the machinery. Modern, computer-controlled robot systems can be easily reprogrammed as required. The foil wrapping of many selection box chocolates is a problem for the conventional metal detectors used in food factories to ensure that no loose machinery parts have accidentally found their way into the product. British chocolatier Thorntons overcame this issue by using an X-ray system.\\"Thorntons\\", Quality Today, p. cxix, 2001 .

History In 1970 John Rewind was teaching guitar at Roger Calkins Music on Market Street in San Francisco, California. One of his students, Lee Humphries, kept telling John about the talents of his buddy Joe Crane, with whom he was in the Coast Guard. Joe played bass with Johnny & Edgar Winter in high school back in Conroe, Texas, and had been produced by the infamous Huey Meaux. Between Lee's description, and confirmation from Al Amis, who also worked at Roger Calkins and had heard Joe sing, John went to the Alameda, California, Coast Guard Officer's Club to see Joe perform, and the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils were born. Another one of John's guitar students, \\"Funky Jack\\" Leahy, who lived up the street from John in the Haight-Ashbury district, had just closed his poster business Funky Features, and was getting into recording and was building a studio. When Jack heard Joe and John, he took the lead and started recording the band and making connections for the band to get a recording contract with a major label. After a few personnel changes, Glenn Walter, who had played drums in a band called The Zoo and released a single in St. Louis, Missouri, with John during the 1960s, joined the band, along with Richard Greene (aka Dexter C. Plates) on bass. Richard had played in groups around the Washington, D.C. area, most notably with Roberta Flack. Modeled after the names of bands in the 1950s, Joe Crane and his Hoodoo Rhythm Devils signed with Capitol Records under the direction of Michael Sunday and Jack Leahy, made their first record Rack Jobber's Rule in 1971. The name was too big of a mouthful, so it was shortened to the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils. Roger Allen Clark, fresh from the Steve Miller Band, was added on drums with the second album, The Barbecue of DeVille on Blue Thumb Records in 1972. The Hoodoos toured extensively that year playing with Savoy Brown, The Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan, Chuck Berry, John Lee Hooker, Graham Central Station, Tower of Power, Mott the Hoople, Bloodrock, and The Tubes. Roger Clark left to become a studio session drummer working for Rick Hall in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Keith Knudsen, formerly of Lee Michaels' band and later the Doobie Brothers, then joined for a short stint on drums from late 1972 to mid 1973 before Jerome Kimsey joined the band for the recording of their third album, What the Kids Want, for Blue Thumb Records in 1973. The Hoodoos continued to tour the United States and Joe began having some of his songs covered by Johnny Winter, The Chambers Brothers, Rodger Collins, and Patti LaBelle. In 1973 Richard Greene left to become a sought- after recording engineer at Russian Hill Recording in San Francisco, and was the famous \\"Fall Into The Gap\\" voice. Roger Stanton replaced Richard on bass. 1973 and 1974 saw non-stop touring and took the band from Canada to Texas, California to Florida tearing up many a dancehall and 'burning down' many a nightclub. The band went their separate ways in 1974, only to reform a year later with a new lineup and recorded the famous \\"Lost Album\\" that was never released until 2012. Jack Leahy and Bob Simmons of KSAN-FM in San Francisco formed World Records, and recorded, produced, and released the album Safe In Their Homes in 1976. Fantasy Records in Berkeley, California, re-released Safe in Their Homes. The Hoodoo Rhythm Devils was revived and strong playing concerts and clubs. (See Wolfgang's Vault for live concerts from Winterland in San Francisco). In 1978, Crane and Walters, recorded their second Fantasy Records album All Kidding Aside, which was produced by Clayton Ivey and Terry Woodford. It included guest musicians the Muscle Shoals Horns, Roger Allen Clark, Tom Roady, and many other well-known Muscle Shoals session kings. The band continued on until Joe Crane died from leukemia in 1980. After the band's demise, several compilations were released by Rear Window Music. In 2013, the Hoodoo Rhythm Devils released a live recording recorded at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead, New York on November 28, 1972 that had been broadcast live on WLIR-FM. In 2014 they released One Night Only, a CD which featured some jams with Johnny Winter and a live recording of the Texas Day Special with the Pointer Sisters that had been broadcast live on KSAN-FM from San Francisco in 1973. 2016 brought The Best Of The Hoodoo Rhythm Devils Volume II CD that featured a variety of unreleased tunes, demos, and a reunion tune with surviving members and their children. The album also features Tower of Power, The Pointer Sisters, Norton Buffalo, Greg Douglass, John McFee, and the Two Tons of Fun - Martha Wash and the late Izora Armstead. Glenn Walters has carried on as fixture vocalist and drummer in the San Francisco area, well known in the advertising business with his Taco Bell, Blue Diamond Almonds, Selix Tuxedos, etc., spots, and gigs regularly with the Glenn Walters Quartet and with Sidepocket, a cover band that performs for weddings and other social events. Richard Greene is a member of The Bobs, the Grammy-winning a capella group. John Rewind continues as a producer, guitarist, and songwriter for Rear Window Music, producing recordings with Georgia Whiting, Davey Pattison, Bobby Black, and many others. Roger Allen Clark currently tours with Travis Wammack in the Muscle Shoals and Nashville area.

He was the first civic architect in the city and was responsible for many buildings across West Texas in the last 20 years of the 19th century. Life Oscar Ruffini's shack, moved to Fort Concho in the mid-20th century. Oscar Ruffini was born on 10 April 1858 to an Italian, Ernest Ruffini, and a German, Adelaide Reihme, who migrated to the United States of America shortly after their marriage in 1848. Oscar and his siblings, Frederick, Alvin, Clara, and Camilla, were raised in Cleveland, Ohio. Documentation on Oscar's life before his arrival in San Angelo, Texas is spotty, but at 14 he and Frederick were apprenticed to a Cleveland-based architect. Oscar went independent four years later, while Frederick remained under the architect's tutelage.Prestiano 1984, p. 4 From 1875 to 1877, Oscar worked for an architect in Cincinnati named George W. Rapp. From 1878 to 1880, he may have been residing and studying in Paris, though it is not known where exactly he studied.Prestiano 1984, pp. 4–5 Ruffini was back in the United States definitively by 1880, as he was at that time working in Evansville, Indiana. He then worked in St. Louis, Missouri from 1882 to 1883 in an unknown capacity. In early 1883, Frederick called Oscar to work for his practice in Austin.Prestiano 1984, pp. 5–6 Architectural style and legacy Ruffini's style leaned in a Neoclassical direction. Surviving sketchbooks in the possession of the Fort Concho Museum contain studies and sketches of Classical statuary and architectural details. Rather than Impressionism or avant-garde, in vogue in Paris during the 1870s, when Ruffini was alleged to have been studying there, Ruffini was influenced strongly by the Second Empire style of Napoleon III. A number of Ruffini's works featured metal construction, which he most likely learned while working in St. Louis. Metal construction became more and more popular in the United States in the 1850s and mid-1880s. It was used in great effect in the central warehouses in St. Louis during the 1870s.Prestiano 1984, p. 6 A number of Ruffini's works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

Turek (July 31, 1947 – ) is the Director of the Center for Sleep & Circadian Biology and the Charles E. & Emma H. Morrison Professor of Biology in the Department of Neurobiology, both at Northwestern University. Turek received his Ph.D from Stanford University. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1991. Background Turek graduated from Stanford University, in Stanford, California, in 1973, receiving a PhD in Biological Sciences; he then completed a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Texas, where he studied in the Department of Zoology from 1973 to 1975. He started working as an Assistant Professor at Northwestern University in 1975, where he still works to this day, serving as the Director of the Center for Sleep & Circadian Biology and as the Charles & Emma Morrison Professor of Biology in the Department of Neurobiology. Research Presently, Turek's research interests revolve around the genetic, molecular, and neural basis for sleep and circadian rhythms. He focuses most of his attention on the role of sleep and circadian clock systems for energy balance, obesity, premature birth, gastrointestinal function, and depression specifically. The Turek laboratory investigates cellular events involved in the entrainment, generation, and expression of circadian rhythms arising from a biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus; the genetics of the circadian clock system; the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying the sleep-wake cycle; the effects of advanced age on the expression of behavioral and endocrine rhythms and on the expression of circadian clock genes; the links between sleep, circadian rhythms, and energy metabolism; the role of melatonin in sleep and circadian rhythms; and other topics regarding sleep and circadian rhythms. Turek's lab spends much of their time working on rodents, but they have also established working relationships with academic researchers. Studies in humans are aimed at shifting the human clock in an attempt to alleviate mental and physical problems that are associated with disorders in circadian time-keeping. Their sleep, circadian, and metabolic studies are focused on how disruption in these functions can lead to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Center for Sleep & Circadian Biology Since 1995, Turek has served as the Director of Northwestern University's Center for Sleep & Circadian Biology (CSCB). The CSCB is a University Research Center, within the Department of Neurobiology, that integrates research on sleep and circadian rhythms into a unified program. Organizations Since 1981 Turek has been a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He also currently serves in roles for the Sleep Research Society: he has been chair of their Government Relations Committee since 2009, and is a member of the SRS National Institute of Health Liaison Group and the SRS Congressional Liaison Group. He also served on the boards of the National Institute of Health National Center on Sleep Disorders Research and the National Sleep Foundation. Turek was also the founder of Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR), where he also served as President from 1987-1992. He is still a member of the SRBR. He is a deputy editor of the journal SLEEP, was editor in chief of the Journal of Biological Rhythms from 1995 to 2000, and was the Section Editor for “Genetics of Sleep” and “Chronobiology” for the 2010 edition of Principles and Practices of Sleep Medicine.

Shri Paramhans Dayal Maharaj Ji is also known as the \\"First Spiritual Master\\" of the [Shri Paramhans Advait Mat]. He initiated the \\"Second Master\\", Shri Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj in the early 1900s. He was born on the day of Rama Navami and was therefore named as \\"Ram Yaad \\". His father was a famous scholar Pandit Tulsi Pathak. His mother died a few months after his birth and he was brought up by his father's disciple Lala Narhari Prasad. Shri Narhari Prasad arranged for his education. Shri Ramyaad gained good knowledge of Sanskrit, Hindi, and Arabic. At the age of five, his father Shri Tulsiram Ji died. Shri Ramyaad attended satsangs which used to happen at his house and which created a great impact on his mind. Paramhans Swamiji gave Diksha to him and taught him about Brahma Vidya. When he was 11 years old, Narhari Prasad died and after some years wife of Narhari Prasad also died. He was the only rightful successor of the both families but at the age of 16, he left his home and went to the forests of Bihar for meditation. He was in Jaipur in 1883, where he met the 90 years old Swami Anandpuri Ji, who taught him the Kriya of Pranayama and Yoga. He reportedly wrote in Urdu on a paper: \\"Accept Paramhans Ram Yaad\\". He named him as his spiritual successor to his seat but Shri Paramhans Dayal Ji renounced the seat too. In his view, fame for a fakir was a fall from grace. Shri Paramahans Dyal Ji travelled from place to place and carried the message of Sahaj Yoga, Bhakti and service unto humanity to one and all. Shri Paramhans Dayal Ji stayed at Jaipur for a considerable time and started the work of spiritual preachings and of uplifting the people there. The number of followers there was quite large. Being a wandering monk. He covered Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, etc. to teach 'Sahajyoga' and 'Bhakti' to the people there. The ashrams (temples) founded by Shri Paramahans Dyal Ji were called Krishana Dwaras. The ashrams in India with the name Sant Mat-a-nuyayi Ashram, Gadwaghat, Varanasi, Brahma Vidyalay and Ashram, Chotka Rajpur, Buxar, Adwait-Swarup Ashram, Paramhans Satyarthi Dham, Rajyog Mandir,Shanti Mohalla,Delhi and Shri Anandpur Satsang Ashram are also related to him. Shri Paramahans Dayal Ji attained Nirvana in July, 1919 after transferring succession of the seat to Swami Swarupanand ji. He had promised to his devotee Seth Amirchand, that he would sacrifice his body and take Samadhi at his place. A Sacred Samadhi Shrine was built at that place in Teri, KP, Pakistan. After that till 1997, devotees consistently visited the shrine of Paramhans Dayal Ji Maharaj uninterrupted. Meanwhile due to high value of the land a dominant neighbor to the Samadhi land, Mufti Iftikharuddin encroached the Shrine land taking it within his boundary as well as stopping the devotees from visiting the shrine. A famous figure Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, Patron of Pakistan Hindu Council and Member of National Assembly from Tharpakar filed a petition in Supreme Court of Pakistan for restoring and allowing the smooth visit of devotees to shrine and an order to remove the encroachment boundary from the pious land. Meanwhile Aurangzeb Khan, Editor, Dawn Pakistan wrote an article upon Paramhans Dayal Ji Maharaj and the pity condition of Samadhi shrine Titled ' Footprints: A Saint Without a Shrine'. To the petition a remarkable result came with the order of Supreme Court of Pakistan's three judge bench headed by Chief Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja ordering the Pakistan's Provincial Government to restore the sanctity of the shrine. At the same time he also ordered to rebuild a temple upon the samadhi. Kamil Khan, a renowned architect on Historical Structures, was hired by the Government administration on the order of Supreme Court to rebuild the Samadhi Temple. Taking about 2 years a grand Samadhi Temple was built and inaugurated on the occasion of Ram Navami of 2017. The temple is located at historical village Teri, District Karak of Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa province in Pakistan.

The journal contains essays, case studies, in-depth perspectives, book reviews, and exhibition reviews. The first issue (Winter 1975 - 1976) appeared shortly after the ACA was established in 1975. Volume numbering discontinued with v. 1, no. 2 (Summer 1976) and went to issue numbers only, i.e. no. 3 (Winter 1976-1977). Content Topics covered have included: the history of archives; individual archivists and archival trends; the analysis of record-keeping practices over time and space; various media and their evolution and characteristics; theoretical problems; practical solutions; new fields of history (and related disciplines), and new kinds of documentation being explored by users; legal and ethical concerns; new technological developments; the relationship of archivists to other information management professionals; and so on. Awards for writers There are three awards given for articles published in Archivaria: * The W. Kaye Lamb Award was established in 1983 and is awarded annually to honor the author of an Archivaria article that most advances archival thinking in Canada. It is the senior award of the journal for the best article overall. * The Hugh A. Taylor Award was created in 2006 and is awarded annually to the author of an Archivaria article that presents \\"new ideas or refreshing syntheses in the most imaginative way, especially by exploring the implications of concepts or trends from other disciplines for archival thinking and activity, and by extending the boundaries of archival theory in new directions.\\" * The Gordon Dodds Prize, established in 2011, recognizes superior research and writing on an archival topic by a student enrolled in a master’s level archival studies program at a Canadian university. Accessibility Indexes to articles appeared in issue number 12 covering number 1 (1976) to 10 (1980) and issue number 22 covering numbers 11 (1980) to 20 (1985). The publication of occasional articles, exhibition reviews and so on in French began from the very first issue of Archivaria in 1976 under general editor Peter Bower. In an effort to provide greater access to articles in English for Francophone speakers, Archivaria began publishing abstracts of each article in French beginning with the Autumn 1993 issue, under general editor Jay Atherton. Issue number 59, in 2005, focused on Quebec's perspective on archival science and featured a number of articles translated from the original French into English. In 2005-2006, ACA and Simon Fraser University Library digitized all past issues of Archivaria for free viewing by the public, using Open Journal Systems software. Archivaria continued after 2006 as an electronic publication in addition to print, however the eight most recent issues of the online version are viewable only by subscribers and ACA members. The journal’s predecessor, The Canadian Archivist, which was published from 1963 to 1974, has also been put online. Indexing In 2010, Archivaria was rated A* by the Australian Research Council Research Excellence exercise.

Simon Philip Van Patten (1852–1918), known by his middle name of \\"Philip,\\" was an American socialist political activist prominent during the latter half of the 1870s and the first half of the 1880s. Van Patten is best remembered for being named the first Corresponding Secretary of the Workingmen's Party of the United States in 1876 and for heading it and its successor organization, the Socialist Labor Party of America, for the next six years. In 1883 Van Patten mysteriously disappeared, with his friends reporting him as a potential suicide to law enforcement authorities. He later turned up as a government employee, however, having abandoned radical politics in favor of stable employment. Biography Early years Simon Philip Van Patten was born February 22, 1852 in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., in the United States,Jerry W. Wilson, \\"Simon Philip Van Patten,\\" Rootsweb at Ancestry.com/ the son of ethnic Dutch heritage.\\"A Socialist Editor Missing: Fears that Philip Van Patten Has Committed Suicide,\\" New York Times, April 23, 1883. One early socialist historian characterized Van Patten as \\"an American of good family, with an excellent education.\\"Morris Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1903; pg. 239. According to U.S. Census data, his father was born in New York state and his mother in Pennsylvania. His father was a renowned naturalist who was a Dutch-speaking confidant of President Martin Van Buren. Philip Van Patten spent much of his childhood in Costa Rica.F.I. Hindmarsh & J. W.Wilson, Descendants of Claas Frederickse Van Petten and his Wife Aeffie Arentse Bradt 84 & 87 (~1996). At the age of 21, Philip Van Patten rented a room without a bath or kitchen on the West Side of Chicago,Chicago City Directory 1873. and worked as an architectural draftsman downtown.Chicago City Directory 1873. In 1874 Van Patten's office was downtown on Randolph Street. Chicago City Directory 1874. He arrived as the boom of building construction necessitated by the great Chicago fire had gone bust due to a national financial crisis.Alfred T. Andreas, Vol. III History of Chicago 64 (1886). From 1875 through 1876, Van Patten supplemented his income by rendering buildings or drawing maps as an insurance surveyor.Chicago City Directory 1875; The Formation of the Workingmen's Party of the U.S.: Proceedings of the Union Congress Held at Philadelphia, July 19–22, 1876 (P. Foner, ed., 1976) Political career According to the recollection of pioneer Chicago Socialist George A. Schilling, Philip Van Patten seems to have become involved in the radical politics in about 1875, joining John McAuliffe and John Eckford as among the first group of English-speaking Socialists in that city.George A. Schilling, \\"History of the Labor Movement in Chicago,\\" in Lucy Parsons (ed.), Life of Albert R. Parsons, with Brief History of the Labor Movement in America. Chicago: Lucy E. Parsons, 1889; pg. xv. Other leading English-speaking Chicago socialists in this period, who had organized themselves as part of the Social Democratic Party of North America (SDP), included Schilling himself, Thomas J. Morgan, John Paulson, and Albert R. Parsons. Of this group, Van Patten does not seem to have been a gifted orator, for Schilling recalls that \\"at this time A.R. Parsons and John McAuliffe were the only ones capable of expounding in public the principles of the party in the English language.\\" The official organ of this group was a weekly newspaper published in New York City called The Socialist. In July 1876 the SDP joined with trade union-oriented groups loyal to the First International at a Unity Congress to establish the Workingmen's Party of the United States. The name of The Socialist was changed to The Labor Standard and retained as the official English language voice of the organization,The German-language organs were the Vorbote from Chicago and the Sozial-Demokrat from New York. See: Selig Pearlman, \\"Upheaval and Reorganization,\\" in John R. Commons, et al., History of Labour in the United States: Volume 2. New York: Macmillan, 1918; pg. 271. with a new editor named to take charge of the publication. Chicago was named as the seat of the Executive Committee of this new organization and it was this Chicago committee that named Philip Van Patten as the Corresponding Secretary of the new organization.Selig Pearlman, \\"Upheaval and Reorganization,\\" in John R. Commons, et al., History of Labour in the United States. New York: Macmillan, 1918; pg. 271. Chosen to be the Party's leader at the age of 24, Van Patten continued to lead the party until 1883. Van Patten attributed his own rise to Party leadership to \\"the difficulty in getting anyone who could write correct English,\\" due to the fact that the party consisted largely of German immigrants.Letter from Van Patten to G. Schilling (Jan. 12, 1882), Schilling Papers, Illinois State Historical Library, quoted in Howard Quint, The Forging of American Socialism 19 (1953). The railway strike of 1877 A great railroad strike erupted in the Eastern United States in 1877, spreading West to the working class center of Chicago, where it was conducted directly by the National Executive Committee of the NEC.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States,\\" pg. 224. Chief among the leaders of this Chicago organization were National Secretary Philip Van Patten, head of the Chicago City Committee, George A. Schilling, and English-language newspaper editor Albert R. Parsons. The cause of this strike was a severe economic depression which had begun as the Panic of 1873 and which continued uninterrupted through 1877. One of the hardest-hit sectors of the American economy was the railroad industry, which had been the object a speculative bubble of massive investment between 1867 and 1877.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 220. As one historian has observed, thousands of miles of costly railroads had been constructed in this period \\"on the mere expectation of the future development of the country, and without reference to the actual requirements of traffic.\\" The so-called \\"Long Depression\\" of 1873 had seen a particularly severe contraction in the railroad sector, with wages of railroad workers slashed by an average of approximately 25 percent by 1877. In June 1877 another cut of 10 percent was announced by several major rail lines and strikes erupted in response. On July 21 the Workingmen's Party held two giant mass meetings in support of the strikers — an outdoor meeting conducted in German and an indoor session at Stack's Hall in English.Aaron Brenner, Benjamin Day, and Immanuel Ness, The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History. Armonk NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2009; pp. 187-188. At these sessions the Workingmen's Party called for the nationalization of the railroads and for the establishment of an 8-hour day throughout America. A huge torchlight march took place the next night, attended by an estimated 15,000 Chicagoans. This rally marked the eve of the escalation of the strike, as on July 23 striking workers on the Michigan Central Railroad marched to the shops of the B & O and the Illinois Central to call out those workers to join the strike for higher wages. Machine shops, factories, and mills were swept up in the strike wave. Employers and law enforcement authorities launched an offensive of their own, bringing about the firing of Workingmen's Party leader Albert Parsons from his job as a printer, and breaking up a WP meeting attended by 5,000 striking workers, family members and sympathizers through the copious use of nightsticks. Philip Van Patten was severely beaten during the strike, narrowly escaping serious or fatal injury.Harmut Keil, \\"The German Immigrant Working Class of Chicago, 1875-90: Workers, Labor Leaders, and the Labor Movement,\\" in Dirk Hoerder (ed.), American Labor and Immigration History, 1877-1920s: Recent European Research. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1983; pg. 161. Van Patten was arrested as a strike leader, taken to police headquarters, and threatened with hanging — as had been Parsons earlier in the day. Violence was indeed escalated on July 24, when police fired upon strikers at the railroad yards, killing 3 and wounding at least 8 others; they used their clubs again later in the day to break up a Workingmen's Party rally. Violence continued for the rest of the week, with a final death toll recorded of at least 18 workers in the successful crushing of the Chicago strike. Chicago in the 1870s Cover of the pamphlet of stenographic proceedings of the 1877 \\"National Congress\\" which re-elected Philip Van Patten Secretary of the SLP. The headquarters city of the Socialist Labor Party moved several times in its early years and Philip Van Patten followed it. The 1st National Congress of the organization, held in Newark, New Jersey in December 1877, moved the NEC and party headquarters to Cincinnati, Ohio,Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 225. at the time the site of a large and active \\"Section\\" of the party.Philip Van Patten, \\"Report of the NEC to the 2nd National Convention of the Socialist Labor Party of America: Allegheny City, Pennsylvania — Dec. 26, 1879.\\" Corvallis, Oregon: 1000 Flowers Publishing Co., 2011; pg. 2. Van Patten dutifully relocated there in mid- February 1878.\\"The Socialistic Labor Party,\\" Cincinnati Enquirer, vol. 36, no. 42 (Feb. 11, 1878), pg. 8. By the time the NEC had established itself in that city in March 1878 factionalism and discouragement had largely disrupted the local organization, however, a situation exacerbated by the failure of the party's Cincinnati-based daily, the Ohio Volkszeitung, in September of that year. Even before the next convention of the SLP at the end of 1879, Secretary Van Patten and party headquarters had moved to Detroit, Michigan, with a new NEC elected by that thriving Section. Controversy was soon to erupt, however, pitting the electoral politics-oriented Van Patten and the Detroit NEC against the radical activities of Section Chicago, who were sliding towards direct action and decentralization that were part of a growing anarchist ideology. One unintended consequence resulting from the smashing of the 1877 Chicago railway strike with armed force was a radicalization of the labor movement in that city.Frederic Heath, Socialism in America (aka Social Democracy Red Book). Terre Haute, IN: Debs Publishing Co., 1900; pg. 34. As early as 1875 there had been established in Chicago a workers' militia known as the Lehr und Wehr Verein (Education and Defense Society) — a paramilitary organization which declared itself armed and ready to defend the working class against manifestations of state violence against striking workers and their political activities. These units of armed workmen drilled in public with rifles in hand, marching under the red flag, amidst public pronouncements that workers' militia groups would henceforth come to the aid of striking workers against the state militia in the event of a strike.Heath, Social Democracy Red Book, pp. 34-35. By May and June 1878, the popular press was filled with sensational stories positing an armed insurrection to seize the state by these groups.Van Patten, \\"Report of the NEC to the 2nd National Convention of the Socialist Labor Party of America,\\" pp. 11-12. Van Patten and the Detroit NEC of the SLP which he headed were outspoken opponents of the Lehr und Wehr Verein, instead advocating the use of electoral methods to win control of the state by the workers movement.Heath, Social Democracy Red Book, pg. 35. In response to the June 1878 press frenzy, Van Patten published a document \\"denying the false reports that our Sections were arming, and informing the public that our party, as a party, would not be responsible for any violations of law by its members,\\" as he put it.Van Patten, \\"Report of the NEC to the 2nd National Convention of the Socialist Labor Party of America,\\" pg. 12. This position placed Van Patten in opposition to the Chicago organization, including the staffs of the daily Chicagoer Arbeiter Zeitung and the weekly Vorbote, which ridiculed the NEC mercilessly. The NEC responded with a public statement made to the press disavowing allegations that the Socialist Labor Party was arming and advising all party members to disassociate themselves from armed militia groups. Section Chicago was specifically requested to exclude the Lehr und Weir Verein from a scheduled public demonstration which was in the offing. Van Patten recalled: > This declaration was received by the Chicago section with the most bitter > contempt. The advice was disregarded and the armed organization welcomed to > the procession. The editor of the Arbeiter Zeitung and Vorbote (Paul > Grottkau), not satisfied with this, attempted to create a permanent breach > in our party by printing thousands of extra papers filled with abuse of our > Committee, ignoring all explanations showing the good intentions which had > actuated us, so as to maintain the honor of the Party we repudiated the > Vorbote as our organ until such time as its tone should be corrected.Van > Patten, \\"Report of the NEC to the 2nd National Convention of the Socialist > Labor Party of America, pg. 13. Called upon to decide the question, the 2nd National Convention of the SLP, held in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania at the end of 1879 narrowly approved after heated debate a resolution of censure of the actions of Van Patten and the NEC for intervening in the local affairs of Section Chicago.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pp. 234-235. This was not held against Van Patten personally, however, and he was returned as National Secretary by the convention, which was ultimately controlled by the moderate rather than the radical wing of the party.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 235. Decline of the SLP During this interval, Van Patten fulfilled a dual Secretarial role, not just heading the SLP but also serving as Secretary of the governing General Executive Board of the Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor, an early trade union federation largely composed of ethnic Irish and English members.Bruce C. Nelson, Beyond the Martyrs: A Social History of Chicago's Anarchists, 1870-1900. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1988; pg. 45. In this organization Van Patten was a voice which advocated closer relations between the Knights and the existing radical, ethnic German-dominated local unions of the Chicago Central Labor Union (CLU), from which anti-Socialist unionists and the Knights had seceded in 1880. Close relations and joint parades, picnics, and demonstrations of the CLU and the Knights after 1881 were largely a product of Van Patten's efforts in this regard. Van Patten and his electorally-oriented comrades sought to field a socialist candidate in the Presidential election of 1880, or to at least support an alternative to the so-called \\"old party\\" candidates that was not inimical to the Socialist Labor Party's goals. To this end, Van Patten and several other members of the SLP traveled to the national convention of the Greenback Party, which ultimately nominated James B. Weaver for the Presidency, in an attempt to \\"socialize\\" that party's platform.Howard H. Quint, The Forging of American Socialism: Origins of the American Movement: The Impact of Socialism on American Thought and Action, 1886-1901. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1953; pg. 18. Despite their failure to materially influence the program of the Greenbackers, Van Patten and his associates requested that SLP members support the Greenback Party ticket in the fall campaign — an attitude which further deepened the division between the NEC and the radical trade unionists of Section Chicago. Fighting over the direction of the SLP and the radical workers' movement would remain a matter of bitter debate over the next several years, with the ideas of direct action and armed insurrection steadily gaining momentum throughout the first half of the 1880s.One important landmark in this process was the arrival of militant anarchist Johann Most in the United States in 1882. Membership in the Socialist Labor Party plummeted during this battle. Although the total size of the organization was not stated at the 1879 Convention of the SLP, a subsequent report submitted by New York City activist P.J. McGuire to the 1881 Convention of the Second International claimed a membership of just 2,500 for the American organization — a total disputed by Adolph Strasser, who estimated the count at just 1,500.Hillquit, History of Socialism in the United States, pg. 228. The departure of the left wing of the SLP to the Anarchist movement left the party apparatus, such as it was, in the hands of the electorally- oriented moderates. The December 1881 3rd National Convention of the organization, held in New York City, was attended by a mere 17 delegates, mostly from New York City itself.Quint, The Forging of American Socialism, pg. 18. The convention made New York the headquarters city for the organization and returned Philip Van Patten as National Secretary.Quint, The Forging of American Socialism, pp. 18-19. Van Patten remarked to a correspondent at the time that his re-election related to the party's \\"difficulty in getting anyone who could write correct English\\" and was made possible by the absence at the convention of what he called the \\"thick-headed, dyspeptic element.\\"Phillip Van Patten to George Schilling, Jan. 12, 1882. Original in Schilling Papers, Illinois State Historical Library. Quoted in Quint, The Forging of American Socialism, pg. 19. In 1883, Van Patten was named as a prospective editor of a new labor newspaper that had been launched in New York City called Voice of the People. Van Patten was charged with attempting to raise funding to take the publication from weekly to daily status. He was unable to achieve this, however. Together with the seeming disintegration of the SLP as an electoral force, this general situation was said to have left Van Patten \\"despondent and dejected.\\" In the middle of April 1883, Van Patten crated up all his books and papers and shipped them away to an unknown destination from his lodgings in Manhattan. Government career On April 22, 1883, friends of Van Patten called New York City police authorities to report him missing. Van Patten had suddenly disappeared, leaving behind a letter announcing his plan to commit suicide. This letter was later revealed as a part of a plan to divert attention from Van Patten's decision to abandon the socialist movement in favor of government employment, however. Morris Hillquit, a pioneer historian of the American radicalism, considered Van Patten's loss after a decade of complete dedication to the cause a \\"hard blow to the organized socialist movement of this country,\\" writing; > He was a man of much enthusiasm and devotion, but by no means a strong and > popular leader. It was not so much the loss of his personality as the moral > effect of his retreat that reflected a deep discouragement on the socialist > movement. Later life, death, and legacy Sometime in the 1890s Philip Van Patten reemerged as a prominent architect in Hot Springs, Arkansas.Carlotta R. Anderson, All-American Anarchist: Joseph A. Labadie and the Labor Movement. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1998; pg. 99. Van Patten died on September 20, 1918 in Hot Springs.75 Only the Little Rock Sentinel-Record newspaper noted his passing, with a one paragraph obituary eulogizing Philip Van Patten as \\"one of the leading architects of the city,\\" an \\"early settler\\" of Hot Springs and an active member of the Knights of Pythias.Brad Rockwell, Secret Public Lives of Philip Van Patten.

A version of the third man argument is also given. Authenticity Alexander of Aphrodisias does attribute his quotations which form the extant text of On Ideas to Aristotle. The content also matches with what Aristotle says of the Platonist arguments in his Metaphysics.

The congregation was a member of the Federation of the Sisters of St. Joseph which disbanded in 2013. The Sisters of St Joseph Whanganui received the Decree of Fusion with the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart on 22 February 2013.\\"Federation\\", Sisters of St Joseph of Nazareth website (Retrieved 9 June 2016) History The Sisters arrived in Whanganui in 1880. They arrived as members of the order of Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart which had been founded in Penola, South Australia in 1866 by Mary MacKillop and Father Julian Tenison Woods. Early on in her project of founding these Australia-wide Josephite sisters, Mary MacKillop had met opposition from several bishops, who refused to allow them the freedom from direct diocesan control that the Catholic Church had recommended for the new institute. The problem dragged on until 1888 before their independence from diocesan control was firmly established. It was during this period of confusion that Josephites came to the Wellington Diocese (which at that time included Whanganui) through the intervention of an Irish Marist priest, Father Charles Kirk, who had ministered in Sydney and there learned of this home-grown congregation that was tackling the problem of the education of Catholic children, especially in outback Australia. Father Kirk had spent about three years as an assistant at St Patrick's Marist church in central Sydney before moving on to be appointed Rector at Whanganui in 1875. Aware of the high reputation of the Sisters of St Joseph in Australia, he set about getting them for his school. They came to him from the Bathurst Diocese where Bishop Matthew Quinn had formed the Josephite sisters there into a diocesan group under his direction, and it was as a diocesan group that they were welcomed in Whanganui on 25 April 1880. The Bishop of Wellington, Francis Redwood recognised them as a diocesan congregation for his diocese. To distinguish them from the Josephites who came directly from Mary MacKillop and who had since arrived elsewhere in the Diocese (at Temuka in the South Island), Bishop Redwood asked the Whanganui sisters to change their name to Sisters of St Joseph of Nazareth and that they wear a black veil instead of a brown one. In fact, they soon changed their whole habit from brown to black, and became popularly known as the Black Josephites. Eventually a new convent and large secondary boarding and day school for girls was built on St John’s Hill, Wanganui. It carried on the name of the original school which had been built in the centre of Whanganui when the sisters arrived, Sacred Heart Convent. The Sisters opened seven schools between 1880 and 1900 and many more in the twentieth century from Taranaki to Hawke's Bay, and south to Otaki. In 1883 some of the Whanganui Sisters went to Hiruharama with Suzanne Aubert to help establish the Catholic mission there.

He is one of the official spokespersons of the BJP. Patra was a former Medical officer at Hindu Rao Hospital. He was appointed as an independent director of the board of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) in 2017. Early life and education Patra was born to Rabindra Nath Patra on 13 December 1974 in Bokaro Steel City, then part of Dhanbad district of the state of Bihar, which is now a part of Bokaro_District of Jharkhand. His father worked in the Bokaro Steel Plant. He did his primary and intermediate schooling in Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Bokaro. He did his MBBS from VSS Medical College and Hospital, Burla, Sambalpur, Odisha in 1997 and his Master of Surgery (MS) in General Surgery from SCB Medical College, Cuttack, Utkal University in 2002. He qualified the UPSC Combined Medical Services Examination in 2003 and joined Rao Hospital (located in Malka Ganj, Delhi) as a Medical Officer. Political career In 2012, Patra unsuccessfully fought a municipal election as the BJP's candidate from Delhi's Kashmiri Gate and at the same time resigned from his job to pursue politics full-time. Much before the election, in the year 2010, he was appointed as the spokesperson for Delhi unit of BJP. In the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, Patra campaigned for the BJP and gained visibility on national television. When the BJP came to power, Patra became its national spokesperson. In 2017, Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) appointed him as a non-official director of ONGC. Patra contested the Puri Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 Indian general election, and lost to sitting Biju Janata Dal (BJD) member Pinaki Misra by 11,700 votes. Controversies In February 2016, Patra showed a manipulated version of the famous Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima photograph. Patra held up that image during a TV debate and claimed that the image showed Indian Army soldiers on India's border whereas the actual image depicted an island in the Pacific Ocean and referred to events in 1945 during the Second World War. During another television debate, Patra had shown video which purportedly showed Kanhaiya Kumar shouting secessionist slogans in Jawaharlal Nehru University. In September 2017, Patra was appointed as an independent/Non-Official Director (NOD) of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) Board for a renewable term of three years. Him being an active member and official spokesperson of the ruling party (BJP) was viewed as a violation of the companies act and subsequently challenged in the Delhi High Court by Energy Watchdog (NGO). The petition also alleged the entire selection process to be \\"flawed\\". In November 2017, The Delhi High Court dismissed the PIL on grounds of it being \\"Unsubstantiated\\" and \\"Without Merit\\". The court also stated that questioning Patra's independence to discharge his official duties as an independent director merely on his association with the ruling party (BJP) would be \\"Highly Inappropriate\\". Later, the Supreme Court asked the NGO who filed the PIL to \\"Serve a copy to the Union of India\\". The SC Bench posted the matter for a later date and mentioned \\"After hearing preliminary arguments, we can issue formal notice.\\" In February 2020, Patra tweeted a fake video of ex-INC MLA Naseem Khan chanting 'Pakistan Zindabad.'

Biography He was born August 22, 1792, in the town of Renhe near Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, into an eminent family of scholars and officials. He moved to the capital Beijing with his parents when he was six, about 1100 kilometers to the northwest of his hometown. As a child, he was required to read all the classics in literature, poetry and philosophy. Gong was a grandson of the famous philologist Duan Yucai, who put a lot of hope in Gong and began educating him in the Han period old text classics. Later on Gong studied the new text tradition under Liu Fenglu, as well as Tiantai Buddhism under Jiang Tiejun. But, when he grew up, Gong became more interested in social and government affairs. In 1821 when he was 29, Gong passed the imperial civil examinations at the provincial level and obtained the title of Juren, or Recommended Man. He succeeded to a series of metropolitan posts in the Qing administration. His lifelong desire to serve the nation was frustrated by repeated failure to gain the Jinshi degree, or Presented Scholar. When he finally did pass that in 1829, his low ranking on the list disqualified him from the Hanlin Academy. The highest office he ever held was a chief official on the Board of Rites and Ceremonies in 1837. Gong was interested in studies of the Gongyang Zhuan, using its theory of the historical cycle (chaos - ascending peace - universal peace) to criticize the current social practices in the Qing empire. Concern over the Qing failure to deal with internal problems and Western pressures led Gong in 1830 to join other progressives in founding a literary club to agitate for reform. Unlike most of his political companions, Gong stressed that the greatest danger to Qing society was not Western pressure but the loss of the spiritual basis of society. He also pointed out that apart from domestic troubles, the country was facing external threats from the Russian Czar in the north and the Japanese aggression in the east. In his style and behavior, Gong Zizhen was reminiscent of the early Qing \\"essentrics\\", breaking the ritual norms, gambling, and being disrespectful to elders. In his stance against opium, Gong became a confidant of Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu. When he learned the Qing government had sent his colleague Lin to the south to suppress the opium trade, Gong was very excited and advised Lin to beef up military defenses on the southern and southeastern coasts to fend off a possible invasion of British warships. However, seeing that he could do little to change the government as a minor official, Gong resigned in disillusionment in 1839 when he was only 47. He began to be sunk in confusion, depression and agony following his frustration at court. He tried to relieve himself from the miserable life by resorting to Buddhism. However, he failed to become a Buddhist, because his passion for the nation and his concern about the general public prevented him from cutting off the external connection with the secular world. On the way home to Hangzhou, Gong wrote 315 poems in the traditional form of \\"qiyan jueju\\" or seven-character, four-line \\"cut-shorts.\\" In these poems, the writer recorded what he had seen along the journey, expressed his deep concern about the country on the eve of the conflict that would become known as the First Opium War and put forward his ideas for reform. Gong believed all the problems that had been plaguing the government and society were caused by a disheartening dearth of talents. He said the imperial court was staffed by unqualified officials, and even \\"dumb\\" thieves and \\"incapable\\" bandits were roaming the streets around the country. He also predicted the country would inevitably fall into chaos one day due to this lack of talent. Gong fell ill when he arrived at Danyang, Jiangsu province, about 200 kilometers to the north of his hometown, and died there soon after on September 26, 1841. The poems Gong wrote on the journey were later compiled into a book, Ji Hai Miscellaneous Poems, which is still quite popular among Chinese people today. His first poems date from the age of 15, and during his life he composed a total of 27 volumes of poetry, in addition to more than 300 articles and nearly 800 songs. His works include Annotations on Chinese, A Textual Research on The Three Rituals, A Critical Review of 'History of the Han and Latter Han Dynasties', and Verification on the Names and the Objects in 'Songs of Chu'. Gong's New Text Confucianism influenced thinking of later reform-minded Chinese intellectuals, especially Kang Youwei and Kang's student Liang Qichao.

She sank off the English coast in 1939 after striking a mine. Her sinking has been described as Japan's only World War II casualty outside East Asia before the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. History The ship was named for the Terukuni jinja, a Shinto shrine located in Kagoshima.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1935). The Nomenclature of the N.Y.K. Fleet, p. 50. The Terukuni Maru and her sister ship Yasukuni Maru were built for NYK’s fortnightly scheduled high-speed European service, coming into operation from the autumn of 1930.NYK Line – Nippon Yusen Kaisha.

Both ships were specially designed for tropical conditions, with state-of-the-art air conditioning and fresh air circulation systems, as their routing was south from Japan, through the Indian Ocean, Suez Canal and Mediterranean Sea.Arthur de Carle Sowerby, John Calvin Ferguson, China Society of Arts and Science The China journal, Volume 13. Page 136 Both ships were initially designed for use with geared turbine engines for projected cruising speed of 18 knots. However, under increasing pressure from the Japanese government to use only equipment and technologies available domestically, the design was changed to use standard Mitsubishi-Sulzer marine diesel engines, which reduced cruising speed to 15 knots. The 11,931-ton steel-hulled vessel had a length of , and a beam of , with a single funnel, two masts, and double screws. Terukuni Maru provided accommodation for 121 first-class passengers and 68 second class passengers. There was also room for up to 60 third-class passengers. The ship and passengers were served by a crew of 177.Kawata, T.Glimpses of East Asia (1936) Nihon Yūsen Kabushiki Kaisha, p. 20 Final voyage On September 24, 1939, at 5 PM, Terukuni Maru departed Yokohama on her 25th voyage to Europe. En route, she made her usual scheduled ports of call: Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, Moji, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, and Colombo. After transiting the Suez Canal, she called at Beirut, Naples and Marseilles (where she stayed for four days), followed by Casablanca. At 9 AM on November 19, she transited the Dover Straits, turning north to the mouth of the River Thames and her final destination of London. She took aboard a pilot off the South Downs, and underwent contraband inspection while Royal Navy minesweepers checked her route into London for mines. After receiving clearance to proceed, at 35 minutes after midnight on the morning of November 21, an explosion occurred between her second and third holds, after she struck a German magnetic mine at off Harwich on the Essex coast. She sank in less than 45 minutes,World War: Black Moons. Time Magazine (1939-12-04). Retrieved on 2011-12-12. but there were no fatalities as all 28 passengers and 177 crew members were able to escape in lifeboats. As Japan was officially neutral at the time, the sinking of the Terukuni Maru led to a diplomatic incident between Japan and both the United Kingdom and Germany. Both countries officially denied responsibility for the mine. However, it is almost certain to have been a German mine because the type of mine used is one that had been developed by the Germans and because the United Kingdom would not have placed mines in its own shipping lanes. Although Japan was increasingly allied towards Germany, the Japanese government protested the loss with the Nazi German government, but the ship owner was not compensated for the loss. The wrecked ship lay partly submerged on its side at depth, visible to wartime shipping.Lund & Ludlam. (1979) Out Sweeps! The Story of the Minesweepers in World War II. New English Library p.17 The wreckage was examined for salvage potential, but salvage work was not undertaken. In 1946 the ship was demolished with explosives as part of a British effort to remove war debris from coastal waters. The remains of the Terukuni Maru have been recorded.

Specification The elastic net method overcomes the limitations of the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method which uses a penalty function based on :\\\\\\\\beta\\\\_1 = \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{j=1}^p \\\\beta_j. Use of this penalty function has several limitations. For example, in the \\"large p, small n\\" case (high-dimensional data with few examples), the LASSO selects at most n variables before it saturates. Also if there is a group of highly correlated variables, then the LASSO tends to select one variable from a group and ignore the others. To overcome these limitations, the elastic net adds a quadratic part to the penalty (\\\\\\\\beta\\\\^2), which when used alone is ridge regression (known also as Tikhonov regularization). The estimates from the elastic net method are defined by : \\\\hat{\\\\beta} \\\\equiv \\\\underset{\\\\beta}{\\\\operatorname{argmin}} (\\\\ y-X \\\\beta \\\\^2 + \\\\lambda_2 \\\\\\\\beta\\\\^2 + \\\\lambda_1 \\\\\\\\beta\\\\_1) . The quadratic penalty term makes the loss function strongly convex, and it therefore has a unique minimum. The elastic net method includes the LASSO and ridge regression: in other words, each of them is a special case where \\\\lambda_1 = \\\\lambda, \\\\lambda_2 = 0 or \\\\lambda_1 = 0, \\\\lambda_2 = \\\\lambda. Meanwhile, the naive version of elastic net method finds an estimator in a two-stage procedure : first for each fixed \\\\lambda_2 it finds the ridge regression coefficients, and then does a LASSO type shrinkage. This kind of estimation incurs a double amount of shrinkage, which leads to increased bias and poor predictions. To improve the prediction performance, the authors rescale the coefficients of the naive version of elastic net by multiplying the estimated coefficients by (1 + \\\\lambda_2). Examples of where the elastic net method has been applied are: * Support vector machine * Metric learning * Portfolio optimization *Cancer prognosis  Reduction to support vector machine  In late 2014, it was proven that the elastic net can be reduced to the linear support vector machine. A similar reduction was previously proven for the LASSO in 2014. The authors showed that for every instance of the elastic net, an artificial binary classification problem can be constructed such that the hyper-plane solution of a linear support vector machine (SVM) is identical to the solution \\\\beta (after re- scaling). The reduction immediately enables the use of highly optimized SVM solvers for elastic net problems. It also enables the use of GPU acceleration, which is often already used for large-scale SVM solvers. The reduction is a simple transformation of the original data and regularization constants : X\\\\in{\\\\mathbb R}^{n\\\\times p},y\\\\in {\\\\mathbb R}^n,\\\\lambda_1\\\\geq 0,\\\\lambda_2\\\\geq 0 into new artificial data instances and a regularization constant that specify a binary classification problem and the SVM regularization constant : X_2\\\\in{\\\\mathbb R}^{2p\\\\times n},y_2\\\\in\\\\\\\\{-1,1\\\\\\\\}^{2p}, C\\\\geq 0. Here, y_2 consists of binary labels {-1,1}. When 2p>n it is typically faster to solve the linear SVM in the primal, whereas otherwise the dual formulation is faster. The authors referred to the transformation as Support Vector Elastic Net (SVEN), and provided the following MATLAB pseudo-code: function β=SVEN(X,y,t,λ2); [n,p]=size(X); X2 = [bsxfun(@minus, X, y./t); bsxfun(@plus, X, y./t)]’; Y2=[ones(p,1);-ones(p,1)]; if 2p>n then w = SVMPrimal(X2, Y2, C = 1/(2*λ2)); α = C * max(1-Y2.*(X2*w),0); else α = SVMDual(X2, Y2, C = 1/(2*λ2)); end if β = t * (α(1:p) - α(p+1:2p)) / sum(α);  Software  * \\"Glmnet: Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear models\\" is a software which is implemented as an R source package and as a MATLAB toolbox. This includes fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with ℓ1 (the lasso), ℓ2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two penalties (the elastic net) using cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. *JMP Pro 11 includes elastic net regularization, using the Generalized Regression personality with Fit Model. * \\"pensim: Simulation of high-dimensional data and parallelized repeated penalized regression\\" implements an alternate, parallelised \\"2D\\" tuning method of the ℓ parameters, a method claimed to result in improved prediction accuracy. * scikit-learn includes linear regression, logistic regression and linear support vector machines with elastic net regularization. * SVEN, a Matlab implementation of Support Vector Elastic Net.

The line was operated by the Altona-Kiel Railway Company (, AKE), which was nationalised in 1884. In railway timetables, the line was soon shown in three sections. From Eutin to Ascheberg it was considered part of the Kiel–Lübeck railway. The westernmost section from Ascheberg to Neumünster was now managed as a separate line (the Neumünster–Ascheberg railway). In the 1970s, a single daily pair of services ran between Heide and Neustadt and six pairs of stopping services operated. The express train stopped between Eutin and Neustadt only in Bujendorf. Its travel time was 19 minutes, while the stopping trains took about 22 minutes. Services were operated mainly by class 515 accumulator railcars and class 798 Uerdingen railbuses, but there were also locomotive-hauled trains. Around 1976 there was a pair of express trains on the Kiel–Puttgarden route, which operated in summer. In 1980. “Trans-Europ- Express-Marchandises” international freight trains operated of the Hamburg- Eidelstedt–Neumünster–Eutin–Neustadt–Puttgarden route. Finally in October 1981, long-distance trains on the Lübeck–Puttgarden railway were diverted via the line. On 22 May 1982, passenger services were closed on the line. Freight traffic was closed on 31 December 1982 (according to other sources on 30 December 1983 or 3 June 1984). The tracks were removed in 1984/85. In the town of Eutin there are still tracks to a tank loading facility at the local army barracks, but they have not been used for years.

It is spoken mostly in the Torre Valley in the Province of Udine in Italy, in the northern part of the historical region known as Venetian Slovenia, and in some villages in western Slovenia. It belongs to the Littoral dialect group. Historically, it included the village of Pers ( or Brieh), the westernmost ethnically Slovene village.Bandelj, Andrej, & Primož Pipan. 2014. Videmsko. Ljubljana: Ljubljansko geografsko društvo, p. 93.Gorišek, Gorazd. 2011. Med slovenskimi rojaki v Italiji. V gorah nad Tersko dolino. Planinski vestnik 116(5) (May): 41–44, p. 44. The dialect was written already in the Cividale manuscript in 1479, but was later not used in written form. Nowadays, because of the lack of language policy and Italianization, the dialect has a very reduced number of speakers and is threatened with extinction. The Italian municipalities of Taipana and Lusevera and the village of Breginj in Slovenia are the only areas where the dialect is still maintained. In 2009, a dictionary of the Torre Valley dialect was published, based on material collected mainly at the end of the 19th century, but also in the 20th century.  Geographical extension  The Torre Valley dialect is spoken in the mountainous area of eastern Friuli, along the upper course of the Torre River to west of the Natisone River, in the historical region known as Venetian Slovenia. It is located south of the Resian and Soča dialect, and west of the Natisone Valley dialect. To the east, it is bordered by Friulian. Most of the dialect’s territory is in Italy, except for the area around Breginj and Livek in Slovenia.Toporišič, Jože. 1992. Enciklopedija slovenskega jezika. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, p. 327. Phonological and morphological characteristics The Torre Valley dialect is quite variegated because its territory covers rugged terrain. It has pitch accent, non-retracted accents (in comparison to Standard Slovene) on final syllables (e.g., wadȁ 'water'), the phonological development of soft l > j and g > ɦ, and preservation of soft n and č. The vocabulary has many Friulian loanwords.

In their second year under head coach Tommy Prothro, the Bruins compiled a 9–1 record (3–1 AAWU), finished in second place in the Athletic Association of Western Universities, and were ranked #5 in the final AP Poll. UCLA's offensive leaders in 1966 were quarterback Gary Beban with 1,245 passing yards, running back Mel Farr with 809 rushing yards, and Harold Busby with 474 receiving yards. Heading into the final game of the 1966 season vs. USC, UCLA was 2–1 in conference games, 8–1 overall and ranked #5 in the country. The Bruins, featuring a \\"dream backfield\\" of All-Americans Gary Beban and Mel Farr, lost only one game, at rainy Washington, 16–3, where Huskies' head coach Jim Owens had devoted his entire season to beating Prothro. UCLA had beaten UW the season before, 28–24, with Prothro's trick play, the Z-streak in which a receiver trots towards the sideline like he's going out of the game and then runs a streak pattern unguarded by the inattentive defender. USC was 4–0 in conference and 7–1 overall, having lost to the unranked Miami Hurricanes. The Bruins and Trojans played a different number of conference games due to uneven scheduling caused by new AAWU members Oregon and Oregon State and schedules made years in advance. It was widely assumed that only losses would be considered and the winner of the 1966 UCLA- USC game would go to the 1967 Rose Bowl. UCLA star quarterback Gary Beban broke his ankle the week before in a win over Stanford, but backup Norman Dow, making his first and only start at quarterback, led UCLA to a 14–7 win.John Hall – BRUINS DO IT AGAIN!

Los Angeles Times, November 21, 1966 That left USC with a 4–1 conference record (7–2 overall) and #5 UCLA with a 3–1 conference record (9–1) overall. Due to their win over USC, it was widely assumed UCLA would get the Rose Bowl berth. However, a vote the next Monday among the AAWU conference athletic directors awarded USC the Rose Bowl berth. It was speculated that the directors believed Beban could not play for UCLA in the Rose Bowl due to the broken ankle, thereby giving the Big Ten Conference representative, Purdue, a better chance to win. As it turned out, Beban could have played. But a bigger reason was that this was to make up for 1964 when Oregon State was voted in ahead of USC. The coach of Oregon State in 1964 was Prothro. Another speculation was the vote was against UCLA out of pure jealousy by the rest of the conference, which voted 7–1 for the clearly inferior team. This vote deprived Prothro of being the first coach to earn three consecutive Rose Bowl berths and UCLA athletic director J. D. Morgan called it a \\"gross injustice\\" and the \\"a dark day in UCLA and AAWU Athletic history.\\" Inflamed UCLA students who had gathered for the Rose Bowl celebration rally, took to the streets of Westwood in protest and actually blocked the 405 Freeway for a short time. Ironically, Morgan was the force behind establishing a tie-breaking method adopted by the conference one year later in which only loss column counted; the first tiebreaker was head-to-head results, followed by overall record. If there was still a tie, the Rose Bowl berth would go to the team that had not played in the Rose Bowl the longest. But it was too late for UCLA. In their final game, USC made the AAWU decision look bad by losing at home in the L.A. Coliseum to Notre Dame, 51–0. They went on to lose the Rose Bowl as well to Purdue, 14–13, finishing the season at 7–4.

And the tilt aftereffect (TAE)Gibson, J. J., & Radner, M. (1937). Adaptation, after-effect and contrast in the perception of tilted lines. I. Quantitative studies. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 453-467. is the phenomenon that the perceived orientation is changed after prolonged inspection of another oriented line or grating (temporal context; see Fig.2). It has been reported that the magnitude and the direction of the perceived orientation shift depends on the relative orientation between test and contextual stimuli (see Fig.3). Psychophysics experiments have shown that relative orientations between 0 deg and about 50 deg produce repulsion effects (the test line or grating tends to rotate away from the contextual stimulus), which is known as the direct form of the tilt effect; but larger relative orientations up to 90 deg produce attraction effects (the test line or grating tends to rotate towards the contextual stimulus), which is known as the indirect form of the tilt effect. It has been observed repeatedly that indirect effects are smaller than direct effects.Morant, R. B., & Harris, J. R. (1965). Two different after-effects of exposure to visual tilts. The American Journal of Psychology, 218-226.O'Toole, B., & Wenderoth, P. (1977). The tilt illusion: repulsion and attraction effects in the oblique meridian. Vision Res., 367-374. The repulsion peak is about 3 degrees usually when the relative orientation between the test and contextual stimuli is around 20 degrees; and the attraction peak is usually maximally 0.5 degrees when the relative orientation is around 70 degrees (see Fig.3). The original experiments showing the TI and TAE These effects were first studied by Gibson in 1937. The subject's vision was restricted so that he could see a black line (the test line) bisecting a white circular field, and he could grasp the edges of a disk to rotate the line about its midpoint. An experimenter would sit behind the disk to set the stimuli and to record the subject's adjusted position of the line. During the tilt aftereffect experiment, the subject was required to look at an oriented line for four minutes, and then to adjust another line to a position which appeared to be vertical. In the simultaneous tilt illusion experiment, a tilted grating was introduced into the circular field of the subject, and the subject was supposed to set the adjustable line to vertical before and after the tilted grating had been superposed on it. Both experiments showed that the position which appeared to follow the subject's perceived vertical was slightly off the objective vertical, and the perceived orientation shifts depended on the relative orientation between the test line and the adapted line or the simultaneously induced line. Tilt effects under various conditions The tilt effects have been tested with various stimulus parameters, such as spatial frequency, color, luminance and contrast differences between the test grating and the contextual grating, and disparity depth or temporal separation between them. Dichoptic presentation, \\"invisible\\" and natural image contextual stimuli have also been studied. It has been shown that both the TAEWare, C., & Mitchell, D. E. (1974). The spatial selectivity of the tilt aftereffect. Vision Res., 735-737. and the TIGeorgeson, M. (1973). Spatial frequency selectivity of a visual tilt illusion. Nature, 43-45. are spatial frequency specific, since both effects (TI and TAE) of the direct form (repulsion) are reduced considerably if the test and the contextual grating differ in spatial frequency. It has been further suggested by Wenderoth and Johnstone (1988)Wenderoth, P., & Johnstone, S. (1988). The different mechanisms of the direct and indirect tilt illusions. Vision Res., 301-312. that separation between the contextual and test stimuli, with either the spatial gap or the spatial frequency difference, reduces the magnitude of the direct but not the indirect tilt illusion. They also showed that reducing the diameter of the contextual stimulus reduces the direct effect but the indirect effects are relatively constant. According to Durant's paper in 2006,Durant, S., & Clifford, C. W. (2006). Dynamics of the influence of segmentation cues on orientation perception. Vision Res., 2934-2940. in the direct form of tilt effects, the largest illusion occurs when the test stimulus and the context surround are presented simultaneously; the spatial gap, the relative contrast and depth cues result in a reduced TI. Experiments also show that both TI and TAE occur for contextual and test stimuli that differ in color and luminance.Lovegrove, W., & Over, R. (1973).

When the test line is presented in one eye and the context in the other (dichoptic presentation), the magnitude of the tilt illusion reducesParadiso, M., Shimojo, S., & Nakayama, K. (1989).

Inter-ocular transfer of the tilt illusion shows that monocular orientation mechanisms are color selective. Vision Res., 2715-2721. And a reversed tilt effect was observed very recently: a direct form (repulsion) of TI under monocular presentation becomes indirect (attraction) for dichoptic stimulation, when the vertical test line inclined by a 20 deg line.Westheimer, G. (2011). Reversed tilt effect for dichoptic stimulation in vertical meridian. Vision Res., 101-104. Another interesting experiment was conducted by Clifford and Harris (2005),Clifford, C. W., & Harris, J. A. (2005). Contextual modulation outside of awareness. Current biology, 574-578. in which the contextual surround was followed immediately by a random noise mask covering the surround but not the center, so the contextual surround would not be consciously perceived. It turned out that an oriented contextual grating can affect the perceived orientation of the test grating even outside of awareness of this context. Furthermore, the illusion maintains when contextual textures have a broad range of orientations (e.g. natural images), even those without a clearly perceivable orientation;Goddard, E., Clifford, C. W., & Solomon, S. G. (2008). Center-surround effects on perceived orientation in complex images. Vision Res., 1374-1382. other oriented features, including illusory contours, an ellipse, a moving dot and a row of dots or lines, also can induce a robust tilt illusion. Mechanisms of the TI and TAE A hypothesis proposed by Blakemore et al. (1971)Blakemore, C., Carpenter, R., & Ceorgeson, M. (1971). Lateral thinking about lateral inhibition. Nature, 418-419. suggested that TAE and TI were both caused by lateral inhibition between cortical orientation detectors. Orientation detectors are evenly in favor of different orientations, but the presence of context could manipulate responses of orientation detectors resulting in detection biases. This hypothesis has been tested and developed. Gibson and Radner (1937) suggested that the TAE occurs because prolonged inspection of a tilted contextual stimulus results in the adaptation to the nearest vertical or horizontal axis of space; therefore, a subsequent vertical test stimulus would tilt away from the vertical or horizontal axis (similar to the idea of color or motion afterimage). However, this adaptation theory predicts a symmetrical TAE with relative orientations between 0 and 45 deg and 45 to 90 deg separation, which is inconsistent with the psychophysical data – the zero crossing occurs closer to 50 or 55 deg rather than 45 deg. Kohler and Wallach (1944)Kohler, W., & Wallach, H. (1944). Figural After-Effects: An Investigation of Visual Processes. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 269-357. suggested a \\"cortical satiation\\" theory to explain aftereffects. Based on this theory, those cortical neurons tuned to orientations between the test and contextual stimuli would normally be excited by either stimulus alone. However, they would be inhibited when both stimuli are presented resulting in a shift apart of the peaks of excitation. By introducing large-angle disinhibition,Wenderoth, P., T., O., & Johnson, M. (1986). The tilt illusion as a function of the relative and absolute lengths of test and inducing lines. Percept. psychophys., 339-345. this theory could also be used to explain indirect tilt effects. Around the 1970s, this theory has been developed into lateral inhibition theory by Blakemore et al.Blakemore, C., Carpenter, R. H., & Georgeson, M. A. (1970). Lateral inhibition between orientation detectors in the human visual system. Nature, 37-39.Carpenter, R., & Blakemore, C. (1973). Interactions between orientations in human vision.

Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat's visual cortex. J. Physiol., 106-154.Hubel, D., & Wiesel, T. (1968). Receptive fields and functional architecture of monkey striate cortex. J. Physiol., 215-243. there are also orientation detectors in the human brain. Any orientation detector in the human visual cortex is excited by a relatively narrow range of orientations (preferred orientations) and is inhibited by a much broader band. The presentation of a single line would be expected to produce a distribution of activity among the population of orientation detectors which is in favor of the stimulated orientation (orientation tuning). The context would generate another distribution in favor of the contextual orientation. By simply adding these two distributions, the peaks of activity in this compound distribution are slightly shifted apart from the individual peaks produced by the single lines. Therefore, when two lines forming an acute angle should appear to be shifted away from each other in orientation (repulsion). Experimentally measured changes in the activity of such orientation detectors in the brain have been shown to correlate closely with the measured change in perceived orientation.Li, W., Thier, P. & Wehrhahn, C. Contextual influence on orientation discrimination of humans and responses of neurons in V1 of alert monkeys. J. Neurophysiol. 83, 941–954 (2000).Shushruth S, Nurminen L, Bijanzadeh M, Ichida JM, Vanni S, Angelucci A (2013) Different orientation tuning of near- and far-surround suppression in macaque primary visual cortex mirrors their tuning in human perception. J Neurosci 33:106–119. Furthermore, mechanistic models of orientation tuning are used to assess the neural basis of experimental findings on tilt effects.Schwartz, O., Hsu, A., & Dayan, P. (2007). Space and time in visual context. Nature, 522-535. Changes on tuning curves would shift population response resulting in tilt biases. Contextual stimuli can possibly change neural firing rates, tuning widths, and preferred orientations, which depends on the relationship between the orientation of the contextual stimuli and the preferred orientation of the neurons. Schwartz et al. (2009)Schwartz, O., Sejnowski, T. J., & Dayan, P. (2009). Perceptual organization in the tilt illusion. Journal of Vision, 1–20. proposed that natural scene statistics could also effect changes on orientation tuning curves with the presence of context. The coordination between the surround and the center across segmentation boundaries is greatly reduced,Schwartz, O., & Simoncelli, E. (2001). Natural signal statistics and sensory gain control. Nature Neurosci., 819-825. and our visual system takes advantage of this natural statistics feature: increased evidence for segmentation information leads the visual system to decouple the coordination between the center and surround.Elder, J.

Spontaneous cortical activity reveals hallmarks of an optimal internal model of the environment. Science, 83-87. In their model, a segmentation probability between the test center and context is introduced to control the amount of contextual modulation. And they showed that this model predicts both the direct and indirect forms in the tilt illusion.

It has also been shown that responses of population neurons (by adding individual responses together) are changed by the context. Fang et al. (2005)Fang, F., Murray, S. O., Kersten, D., & He, S. (2005). Orientation-tuned fMRI adaptation in human visual cortex. J Neurophysiol, 4188-4195. provided fMRI evidence on the tilt aftereffect: after long-term adaptation to an oriented grating, the fMRI response in the human V1, V2, V3/VP, V3A and V4 to a test grating was proportional to the relative orientation between the adapted and test grating. Similarities between the TI and TAE The simultaneous tilt illusion is generated due to spatial context, and the tilt aftereffect is due to temporal context; experimental data however show many similarities between them. Schwartz et al. (2007) reviewed the psychophysical and electrophysiological parallels between the TI and TAE, which are probably revealing functional commonality between spatial and temporal context. It has been shown that when an aftereffect and a simultaneous illusion of opposite biases were paired (first adapting to a clockwise oriented line and then presenting the vertical test line with a counterclockwise inducing line), the two effects summed linearly,Magnussen, S., & Kurtenbach, W. (1980). Linear summation of tilt illusion and tilt aftereffect. Vision Res., 39-42. which also suggests a common mechanism of TAE and TI. It has been suggested that this similarity between the spatial and temporal effect could be explained by the natural scene statistics in which spatial and temporal context always share features, since objects are typically smooth and change slowly. And our visual system adapts these statistics features in order to code information efficiently. However, there is not always a clear temporal analogue to spatial features. For example, spatial features have a key role in linking signals across space to get boundaries inference, while temporal signals may not play the same role.

Regular season This was the year Prothro had geared his recruiting efforts towards as he believed this was his best team and was capable of contending for the national championship. The Bruins, quarterbacked by a sensational Jr. College transfer Dennis Dummit discovered by Prothro, were undefeated until they faced #10 Stanford in Palo Alto. Once again, Prothro was let down by now senior kicker Zenon Andrusyshyn as he missed a short field goal late in the game with the score tied 20–20. Suddenly, two long Jim Plunkett passes had Stanford in field goal range in the final seconds, but UCLA blocked Steve Horowitz's attempt to preserve the tie. Once again, the UCLA-USC game would decide the Pac-8 title and the 1970 Rose Bowl berth. UCLA was ranked 6th with a 5–0–1 record in conference and 8–0–1 overall USC was #5 and was 6–0 in conference and 8–0–1 overall (tied Notre Dame in South Bend, 14–14); UCLA and USC were both unbeaten coming into their rivalry game for the first time since 1952. UCLA scored midway through the fourth quarter to take a 12–7 lead (knowing he need a win and not a tie to advance to the Rose Bowl, Prothro had the Bruins go for two after each touchdown and each attempt failed). USC then drove to the winning touchdown with 1:38 to play to win 14–12. The Trojans were aided by two controversial calls; the first was a dubious pass interference call on UCLA's Danny Graham on a 4th-and-10 incompletion. Secondly, on the winning touchdown pass reception, USC receiver Sam Dickerson appeared to be either out of bounds, out of the back of the end zone, or both. This loss supposedly was harder for Prothro to take than the 1967 loss and the freak officiating calls resembled the debacle at Tennessee in 1965.

In their sixth and final year under head coach Tommy Prothro, the Bruins compiled a 6–5 record (4–3 Pac-8) and finished in a four-way tie for second place in the Pacific-8 Conference. UCLA's offensive leaders in 1970 were quarterback Dennis Dummit with 2,392 passing yards, running back Marv Kendricks with 573 rushing yards, and wide receiver Rick Wilkes with 595 receiving yards. In his final season at UCLA, Prothro's team suffered a rash of key injuries and finished 6–5, yet they were three close games from a 9–2 season and Rose Bowl berth. Before those injuries set in, UCLA took a 3–0 record into Austin to play defending national champ and top ranked Texas. Trailing 13–3 at the half, UCLA rallied and had a 17–13 lead in the final minute. But with 12 seconds left, Texas completed a long pass when their receiver caught the ball between two UCLA defenders, who then collided, allowing the receiver to score. UCLA also blew a 20-point fourth quarter lead against Oregon, when Ducks sophomore quarterback Dan Fouts rallied his team to three touchdowns and a 41–40 win. Finally, there came the showdown with Stanford; the game was expected to be a shootout between UCLA quarterback Dennis Dummit and Heisman winner Jim Plunkett. But the defenses ruled as UCLA took a 7–6 lead into the 4th quarter. Stanford took a 9–7 lead on a field goal, but UCLA was driving to a potential game-winning field goal or touchdown themselves when they completed a pass inside the Stanford 10-yard-line, only to have the receiver get sandwiched by two defenders on the tackle and fumble. This game ultimately decided the Pac-8 championship and 1971 Rose Bowl representative. The season ended on a high note when UCLA beat rival USC, 45–20, in a game that was not that close. This would end up being Prothro's final game at UCLA. Prothro was frustrated by bizarre officiating at critical moments, numerous last minute narrow losses, and losing out of the Rose Bowl by the conference vote in 1966. Prothro also decried the Pac-8 rule that only allowed the conference champion to go to a bowl game; he witnessed many lower ranked inferior teams (often ones he defeated during the season) go to bowl games while his Bruins stayed home. After George Allen was fired by the Los Angeles Rams, Prothro accepted that job.

Some of these accounts are accurate, while some include parts that are accurate and other parts that reflect their biases towards native peoples. One aspect of native life which the European colonists often remarked upon, when they left written records, was their system of agriculture. Agriculture is one of the primary means by which pre-industrial human societies impacted their environments; through plant and animal domestication, disruption of prehistoric soil matrices, and the resulting population increases that some degree of agricultural sophistication makes possible within partially nomadic or fully settled groups of people. Given the topographical and climatological variances found within its borders, Virginia allowed for the development of several unique agricultural systems that worked in concert with traditional hunting and gathering systems. Post-European contact, these modes of subsistence were greatly altered as European technology was introduced to the native Virginians and their grip on their ancestral lands slowly receded towards the mountains. Background History of Virginia The proposed and accepted dates for the beginning of native habitation in Virginia vary widely; traditionally the assumed date was somewhere between 12,000–10,000 B.C. The recent archaeological excavations at Cactus Hill, however, have challenged those dates with hard evidence of far earlier habitation within the state. The Cactus Hill site is located along the Nottoway River in southeast Virginia and is now one of the oldest known sites with evidence of human habitation in the country. Clovis-type tools found at the site have been radiocarbon dated to between 11,500–10,000 B.C., and the remains of hearth fires have been dated to around 15,000 B.C. Work continues at the site, but these findings appear to have set back the generally accepted start of human habitation in Virginia by about 5,000 years. The periods between when native peoples first settled in Virginia (at least 15,000 B.C.) and about 2500 B.C. are called the Paleo and Archaic periods. Tribes in Virginia were hunter-gatherers during these periods and didn't establish permanent settlements. Semi-permanent habitations first appeared during the Sedentary Forager Period (2,500 B.C. – 900 A.D.) and larger settlements had developed by the Middle-to-Late Woodland Period. Tribe distribution The tribes on the coast were part of the Powhatan confederacy. Individual tribes in the region included the Nansemond in the south, the Chickahominy, Pamunkey, and Mattaponi along the central coast, the Potomack on the north shore, and the Accomack on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. In the central and western regions of the state were the Monacan, Mannahoac, Saponi people, Nahyssan, Occaneechi, and Tutelo people. Some Cherokee lived in the southwest, and there was an isolated pocket of Nottoway people and Meherrin tribes in the south between the coast and the Piedmont. Differences in agriculture resulted more from geographical variation than differences in tribal farming practices or customs. Origins of agriculture Agriculture in Virginia is believed to have begun in the same manner that agriculture in most other places developed. Native Virginians made extensive use of wild plants in their subsistence systems, and it's hypothesized that the first attempts made at cultivation in Virginia were the selective nurturing of wild edible plants in ways that encouraged their growth. Eventually, such pseudo-agriculture developed into the purposeful planting, cultivation, and artificial selection of certain species and varieties. The agricultural systems that developed before the introduction of maize and other, more well-known native crops, have been dubbed the Eastern Agricultural Complex. None of the domesticated crops that are usually associated with native Virginians are native to the area. Maize (Indian corn), the predominant native crop in the collective mind of most Americans, came up from Mexico and was incorporated into the native agricultural systems. Squash and beans, the other two crops that make up the famous \\"three sisters\\" agricultural trilogy, migrated up similar routes and eventually became firmly established in native agricultural systems in Virginia around 900 A.D. during the beginning of the Middle Woodland Period. Tidewater Natives in the Chesapeake region and on the Eastern Shore practiced a variety of subsistence methods in order to provide for themselves throughout the year. They gathered wild plants, nuts, and fruit, hunted deers, turkey, and waterfowl, fished along the rivers that feed the Chesapeake, gathered shellfish and mollusks along the coast, and cultivated maize. Some of the best farmland was in the river valleys on the Eastern Shore. By the Late Woodland Period (c. 900–1600 A.D.), however, flooding and rising sea levels made it impossible to farm the lower-lying areas closer to the shore. Once they were pushed onto the less fertile plots of land, native farmers had few choices for improving the lower natural fertility of the new soil. Lacking artificial fertilizers or, prior to European contact, crops that return nitrogen to the soil, natives relied on rotation systems to ensure that they always had at least a few fertile plots available at any one time. Thanks to the lower density populations that Eastern shore natives enjoyed, they were capable of taking plots out of cultivation for several years in order to restore fertility and soil nutrients. Piedmont Thanks to the presence of numerous rivers, the Piedmont offered large amounts of fertile land for native habitation and cultivation. Native settlements tended to be established alongside river- adjacent fields and moved up and down the river every few years in order to allow the soil from the previous fields to be revitalized. The \\"three sisters\\" agricultural concept was commonly implemented across the Piedmont. Aside from providing complete nutrients (when complemented with game and wild plants), the three plants worked cooperatively to preserve soil nutrients. The beans and squash (or gourds) fixed nitrogen in the soil and shaded the ground, preventing the growth of weeds, while the corn gave the beans a stalk to wind around as they grew. It also had the benefit of being a low maintenance form of agriculture; with the gourds holding down weed growth and little to no fertilization needing to be done, the plants could hold their own far more successfully than the labor-intensive European farming systems. Appalachians The soil quality in the Appalachians was (and is) less productive than in other areas state; the hilly geography also makes farming larger areas of land difficult and some regions at higher elevation are drier and harder to grow in than areas lower on the mountains. As a result, agriculture was less pervasive in the mountains than in other regions. Corn was, however, still widely and successfully grown, along with other standard native crops such as variants of squash and domesticated species of formerly wild plants. Effects of European contact on native agriculture The most punishing effect of European arrival and settlement was loss of land. Europeans relied more heavily on farming for their subsistence than the natives did, and were also far more likely to grow surplus crops that could be traded or sold. Thus the new arrivals needed large amounts of fertile land to support their quickly growing populations. Virginia's native population found itself being pushed towards – and eventually over – the mountains as European arrivals snatched up large land grants made by the English governors of the new colony. Agriculture also impacted the relations between the Jamestown settlers and the nearby native populations. It's commonly known that sympathetic natives helped the agriculturally-ill equipped settlers to feed themselves, but the negative effects of those interactions aren't as widely recognized. Virginia suffered several droughts around the time that the Jamestown settlement was established, which limited the abilities of both the natives and the new settlers to provide for themselves. When the natives weren't able to give any more food to their new neighbors (out of concern for the feeding and care of their own people) the Jamestown residents became angered and relations between the two populations degraded significantly. Another impact of European contact was the integration of European crops into native agricultural systems. Primary sources Some of what is known about native agriculture in Virginia comes from archaeological evidence. The majority of the primary sources that mention native agriculture have some degree of Euro-centrism bias, usually with regard to the colonists' belief that native agriculture was \\"uncivilized\\" in some way, or that it didn't exist at all. The primary factor of native agriculture that made it so unappealing to European sensibilities was also the factor that made the native agricultural system so much more successful: the use of interactive crop types that cut down on the labor needed to maintain the fields, as well as enriching the soil and increasing the number of seasons that fields could be used. In some areas, native Virginians also planted their crops in and among the remains of the wooded areas that had been cut down so a field could be cleared. This debris made the fields look somewhat messy, but assisted in adding nutrients back into the soil (through decomposition) and made for an easier and quicker transition back to wild growth once the natives had moved on down the river.

In other words, to understand the world, we move around and explore it—sampling the world through our senses to construct an understanding (perception) of the environment on the basis of that behavior (action). Within the construct of active perception, interpretation of sensory data is inherently inseparable from the behaviors required to capture that data. Action and perception are tightly coupled. This has been developed most comprehensively with respect to vision (active vision) where an agent (animal, robot, human, camera mount) changes position to improve the view of a specific object, or where an agent uses movement to perceive the environment (e.g., a robot avoiding obstacles). By a more formal definition, active perception is: :\\"...a study of Modeling and Control strategies for perception. By modeling we mean models of sensors, processing modules and their interaction. We distinguish local models from global models by their extent of application in space and time. The local models represent procedures and parameters such as optical distortions of the lens, focal lens, spatial resolution, band-pass filter, etc. The global models on the other hand characterize the overall performance and make predictions on how the individual modules interact. The control strategies are formulated as a search of such sequence of steps that would minimize a loss function while one is seeking the most information. Examples are shown as the existence proof of the proposed theory on obtaining range from focus and sterolvergence on 2-0 segmentation of an image and 3-0 shape parametrization\\". The theory of optical flow derives from concepts of active perception, and while optical flow is now typically considered a vector representation of motion captured by a vision sensor (camera), it was originally described in terms of active perception. The behavior of the agent (animal, robot, human) in the world generates a flow of data over the visual sensor (camera, eye), which is sampled by the sensor and interpreted into a percept of the environment by the agent, through some computation. On the basis of this percept the agent selects another behavior that generates more data flow. Thus optical flow is the data flow carried by light from the environment to the vision sensor as a result of movement in the environment. A related but narrower definition of active perception represents perception and action within the brain as the same thing. It states that when a person sees an action, it internally translates into, and is understood within the context of, a possible action. This supports the capability in people and animals of learning what to do based on what they see others doing.(Bargh & Dijksterhuis, 2001, p. 3) Ecological Psychology Active perception is part of the broader field of ecological psychology. Ecological psychology (and theories of ecological perception) was formulated by gestalt psychologists in the 1930s,Koffka, 1936 and refined by Gibson through the 1950s to 1970s.Gibson, 1979, The Ecological Theory of Perception, Haughton and Mifflin, Boston The theory has held strong, although for the approximately 80 years that it has been around, it has always been considered a niche area of psychology.  Applications of active perception  There is a wide range of work on the application of active perception to robotics, including ground vehicles, underwater vehicles, and air vehicles. As one would expect, when optical flow is included in the definition of active perception then the volume of related work significantly increases.

Gans would soon send reports to German Newspapers urging Bessarbian settlers in the Ukraine, Russian Empire and United States (Several Bessarabian German Families settled in Hays, Kansas and Ellis County, Kansas). On August 9th, 1911 Archbishop Célestin-Henri Joussard O.M.I visited the settlement bringing with him German speaking Rev. A Biehler O.M.I. Father Biehler would return in October of the same year with plans to build a small log chapel and rectory the settlement was populated by immigrant settlers of German origin who had previously settled in the Ukraine (Bessarabian Germans). The settlement was officially founded sometime between 1911 and 1914, the consensus today is that the settlement was officially founded in 1912.  Naming  The locality was originally named Westphalia after the Westphalia region in Germany. The locality was renamed St. Louis in October 1911, however the name was yet again changed in 1914 after the desire to build a post-office was put forward, due to the names Westphilia and St. Louis regulated to history, the name was changed to Friedenstal.

Settlers arrived in Muckatah about 1876 when the area was thickly covered by huge trees. These were felled by axe, cut into lengths with a crosscut saw, shaped by broad axe and made into dwellings. The first crops of wheat were grown on areas of up to 10 acres or so with the bags of grain carted to Benalla and later, Numurkah. A bush track was used to travel to Shepparton for mail and supplies. The earliest selections were of 320 acres. A racecourse was in use by 1895 and a golf course on the same site in later years. Some early settlers were Nunan, Noonan, Salmon, Parnell, Gleeson, Lane, Hanrahan, Charles, Jessop, Flynn, Keady, Kennedy, Dunn, Walsh, McIntyre, Fields, Duffy and McCormack. In the early village was a hotel, post office and blacksmith. At Muckatah, an annual St Patrick's Day Race meeting commenced in 1881, and an athletics meet in 1883, the following results were recorded: * Running high jump J. Keating / W.

On that day a prize of 10/- was offered to the winner. Moire Shire Council was formed in 1994 from the amalgamation of the Shire of Cobram, Shire of Nathalia, Shire of Numurkah, and parts of the Shire of Tungamah and Shire of Yarrawonga. Cobram's plan of an amalgamation of the five shires was accepted, but its suggested name for the newly created shire was not. 'Muckatah' was not seen as being sufficiently representative of all the amalgamating shires and so 'Moira' was chosen. Muckatah Football Club In 1888 the Goulburn Valley Football Association (GVFA) was formed and consisted of sides from Cobram, Numurkah, Wunghnu, Yarroweyah, Muckatah and Nathalia, with Muckatah going onto win five GVFA premierships and were runners up eleven times. They also won the two Murray Border Football Association premierships, as well as two Federal District Football Association premierships too! Muckatah joined the Katandra District Football Association in 1930 for one season only and were runners up to the Yabba Football Club. Muckatah was one of the foundation clubs of the Murray Football League (MFL) in 1931, along with the following clubs, Barooga, Cobram, Muckatah, Numurkah, Strathmerton and Tocumwal.

Etymology The word Saikia, ( ) (Ahom language - Ru-Pak) () is a derivative of the Assamese word - Xô, meaning 'one hundred - 100'. It was a military title given to the officials of the Ahom monarchy. Historical Usage The Ahom Kingdom of medieval Assam used the Paik system, a form of corvee labour In this system, a Paik (one soldier) was the tiniest unit of the Ahom military system. A Saikia was the commanding officer of 100 such paiks. The appointment of a Saikia was the responsibility of his Phukan (commander of 6000 paiks) or Rajkhowa (governor of a territory who could command 2000 to 3000 paiks). The paiks had the right to reject a Saikia and request another officer of their choice. Appointments were made irrespective of the paik's religion or ethnicity. Current Usage Over the years, the usage of this title has ceased to be a professional or military title. The surname is now common to Hindus in Assam.

Gundy, a partner in the Toronto real estate firm, Gundy & Gundy, who, in 1915, purchased 35,000 acres of land in the area with the view of selling it to incoming settlers on January 10, 1916. With plenty of land available by homestead grant, there were no buyers for Gundy’s remote scheme, so in 1922 they formed the Tate Creek Cattle Company, better known as the Gundy Ranch. They brought in 1000 head of cattle but lost 900 head the first winter. They then sold all but the land and the buildings. In the stock market crash of 1929, Gundy’s fortune was lost, and any profit from the ranch was retained by the manager of the ranch, whom they were no longer able to pay. About this same time, land north and east of the ranch was opened for homesteading, and in 1932 the Gundy Post Office was established in the home of James Kellar on the B.C. side of the border. In 1936, the Gundy Church was built (also in B.C.), but the Gundy Cemetery on the lot east of the church, was laid out in Alberta. The Gundy Ranch land was eventually acquired by the Canadian Colonization Association, a division of the Department of Immigration and Colonization of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and in 1939 about 500 Sudetens were settled there.

Broadly defined, Ecometrics is a way to evaluate if an activity is contributing to more sustainable systems of production and consumption. Ecometrics is a system of statistical extrapolation and interpolation that uses principles of resource management in economic and environmental studies to analyze trends in consumption. With a comprehensive understanding of ecometrics, and thereby an understanding of the impacts of specific conscious or conventional opportunity costs, agents within economic systems can cause measurable change for the triple bottom line. The term was originally trademarked by Interface Global, a corporation founded by Ray Anderson.Interface Global. \\"Interface Global\\" \\"Definition of EcoMetrics and SocioMetrics\\" , 09.02.2011. The parameters that cause change are often population, technology, transportation, consumption, public conscious, non- renewable or renewable resources, location, labor conditions, transportation and wealth. Ecometrics is used in labeling programs such as the US EPA Fuel Economy and Environment LabelEPA. \\"EPA Fuel Economy and Environment\\" \\"Label for Fuel Economy and Environment\\", 12.23.2011. to determine the environmental and financial advantages of purchasing one car over another. There are many applications of Ecometrics for Environmental Impact CalculatorsCarbonFund, \\"Carbon Footprint Calculator\\" \\"Carbon Footprint Calculator for Individuals and Businesses\\" , 10.10.2011.EERE:Energy Calculator, \\"Calculators for Energy Savings\\"\\"EERE Energy Reduction Practices\\", 10.10.2011.ECO FX:Calculatied Impact \\"ECO FX Impact Calculation Formulas\\", 10.10.2011LCA Calculator \\"Analysis and comparison of the environmental impacts of products and particular design decisions\\", 10.10.2011 infographics, and for political analysis. Because the parameters of ecometrics vary drastically for any activity, the applications of its resulting measurements are sometimes unilateral. Applied ecometrics exposes the complexity of making sustainable decisions, especially given other humanitarian goals such as third world economic development. In this way ecometrics shows any choice within consumption and production systems as wicked problems. An instance of ecometrics is if a restaurant is determining whether to use an electric hand dryer over paper towels, they must determine: #The cost of both #How much energy the electric dryer would consume, and to what degree the energy is renewable. #How long the dryer would last. #If the towels were produced using renewable energy and resources, and to what extent they are able to be recycled without inferring greater cost to the environment(not using further energy or chemicals). #The cost of continuously purchasing paper towels throughout the business's existence. #Maintenance labor to replace the towel dispenser. If this restaurant is located in an area with great solar potential, it is likely that a hand dryer could encourage for more solar infrastructure by being an additional load. If it was incredibly far from a paper recycling center, and the potentially recycled material is likely to be downcycled, there would be further impetus to use a hand dryer. In addition to these considerations, the decider must choose how much they are willing to pay for the environment. In the case that has been built, if the hand dryer is to cost more, they must decide if he is willing to take responsibility by preventing the paper waste that would have been produced by buying the hand dryer and necessary energy. In this case as in many the purchaser enables development and life for other members of all trophic levels within his economic system through his purchasing power. The decisions of consumer agents cause change for the world, and in analyzing the comprehensive impact of individuals and societal practices; ecometrics quantitatively defines sustainable development. As there are diverse environmental and economic parameters, there are numerous unique case studies for ecometric application. The cases that are discussed here are libraries, agricultural food systems, and labeling programs. They model material cycles, energy cycles, and environmental parameter systems respectively. Levels of Magnification play a role in each as scalars in the consumption cycles. Both cycles show the need for more efficient production and consumption cycles for material and energy resources, as well sources for friction in consumer cycles. Labeling programs Transparent labeling programs have been employed to establish coherent truths on the social, environmental or health impacts of products. Several illustrations are GoodGuide, EPA Fuel Economy and Environment, Fair Trade, and LEED. These organizations have sought clarity not just by evaluating the impacts of products, but also by releasing their evaluation process. Beyond producers the certification process is available to the general public including interested consumers. Labeling programs can expose major factors of sustainable or unsustainable consumption cycles. The three main components of consumptions cycles are production, consumption, and disposal. The factors of conventional consumption cycles are challenged by labeling programs that seek to promote sustainable systems. The metrics that make these factors are the parameters that can be used to evaluate the factor's impact. #Production ##Design ##Investment/funding ##Material/Energy Procurement // Modular resourcing ##Creation // Modular Creation ##Assembly ##Transportation ##Stocking #Consumption ##Purchase ##Use ##Deterioration // Planned/Designed Obsolescence ##Upgrade//Repair//Maintenance #Disposal/Recycling ##Allocation//division ##Transportation ##Waste//Recycling//Compost ##Allocation of purified resources into production cycles Parameters that labeling programs seek to expose #Shipment Miles. These include Food miles, and transportation miles that are used consistently in industrial processes. As illustrated the peer-to-peer exchange site, swapexchange, distance is a significant factor in not only the costs of a product, but also its non-renewable (and gradual renewable) energy depletion impact. The concept of shipment Miles shows that globalized trade should be minimized for daily purchases(i.e.: daily food), and reduced as much as possible for infrequent purchases(i.e.: Electronics). In the past, the limited recycling infrastructure and value of transportation energy resources has limited recycling circuits. Because recycling materials required new infrastructure as well as transportation resources, there was limited cycle development. There were also worries that materials would be downcycled. Non- renewable miles will become inherently unsustainable as non-renewable fuel sources diminishes and becomes increasing controversial as an environmentally destructive resource. The need for fuel efficient transportation methods has been recognized by the EPA and implemented through their SmartWay program.EPA Smart Way program \\"EPA\\"”Home page of the SmartWay Program” Program to Increase Traveling Efficiency and Save Money 10.10.2011 #The Unobserved Global Impacts or the Translation of Sustainability. Resources produced in developed countries are often regulated for their environmental impacts. Many industrial countries often do not operate under cohesive regulation, or the regulations that are imposed on producers in consuming countries. This means that producers in external countries may manufacture products under a definition of sustainability that they have defined themselves, and market it to consumer countries with more refined definitions. Under these circumstances energy from non-renewable resources could be used to produce products with minimal hazard regulations, maximizing emissions and hazard production. Fairtrade has sought to improve international standards through their labeling program.Fairtrade \\"Standards for Certification\\" “Certification Standards” 10.10.2011 #Organic production. By excluding pesticides in agricultural processes, producers minimize their impact upon their surrounding ecosystem. Depending upon their location, producers can prevent water from being contaminated and insects from evolving to become more resilient to pesticides. One can compare the impacts of inorganic meat to organic by considering the environmental impacts of pesticides used feeder foods to the reduced efficiency of food conversion(Efficiency of conversion) due to the fact that no antibiotics or growth hormones are used in the production process. The USDA has a National Organic Program for agricultural production that is widely accepted.USDA “National Organics Program” 10.10.2011 #Reinvestment into other socially and environmentally benevolent activities. This is where businesses encourage their employees to volunteer, or donate to humanitarian causes. For instance, Toms of Maine encourages employees volunteer their time and donates money to humanitarian causes.Tom’s of Maine “Community Grant Initiative” 10.10.2011 Tom’s Shoes donates a pair of shoes for every pair that is sold.Tom’s “One for One Program” 10.10.2011 #Certification of the Recycle Content. It is necessary to discern materials that are in a product, especially if they are supposedly recycled or able to be recycled. An instance of this is the recycling of paper material from post- and pre- consumer material, and the ability of certain paper pulps to be recycled. #Ingredients or hazards that are not in the product. Some products have a history of being made with harmful materials or ingredients. Products that are certified as free of these controversial materials are better for consumers and the production ecosystem. Examples of certification are for BPA-Free and EA-Free products.PlastiPure “Plastic Purity Statement” 10.10.2011 Labeling programs highlight sustainable parameters of the consumption cycle in order to promote awareness of practices that benefit the environment, and to encourage conscious consumption. One of the concepts that was established earlier is presented here. By encouraging conscious consumerism, one can not only limit their environmental impact, but also save money. This is the concept where products that are more efficient and durable have less reliance upon complimentary resources, thereby requiring complimentary purchases. For instance, Fuel efficient cars can travel longer with less, and are thus less reliant upon fuel resources. This concept is the basis for the EPA's Fuel Economy and Environment Label.Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Vehicles “Features of Fuel Economy and Environment Label ” Gas-guzzler 11mpg 500px A simple example of an ecometric calculation that can be used to estimate a car's comprehensive cost is: : Total.Cost=Mortgage(real.cost-Rebate/Company funding)+(\\\\int_P^L \\\\\\\\!Current.Fuel.price(cost/gal))*avg.weekly.fuel.cons(gal/week)\\\\ + current.fuel.price(cost))+insurance(cost) Energy flows within agricultural food systems The development of industrial agricultural systems for the food economy is the utilization of energy flows to provide for more economical and widespread production. Although energy flows between trophic levels is an elementary part of life, modern day industrial practices impacts the environment, prompting greater threats to sustainability. In evaluating the efficiency of agricultural systems to support current food consumption and sustain future resources, ecometrics analyzes current use of non-renewable and renewable resources. Energy flows and Efficiency of conversion show that food resources are lost within degree food systems. Next the adverse effects of these components are shown through other process within the production cycle, including the transportation and pesticide impacts of meat and feed production. The impacts of meat consumption are compared to vegetarian consumption. It can be seen that meat production scales the impact of feed production(transportation and pesticide use), and makes additional impacts. Efficiency of conversion within energy flows Energy is used up and lost as heat as it moves through ecosystems, and new energy is continually added to the earth in the form of solar radiation. The earth is an open system in regards to energy, it is constantly accepting it in the form of solar radiation. Nutrients and other materials at large however are continuously circulated within and among ecosystems. The primary organism within any food system is capable of utilizing energy to synthesize organic compounds from inorganic precursors, and of storing biochemical energy in the process. The growth of the plant is primary production, this results in the increase of plant biomass to a system. Primary consumers get their energy from primary producers, and thus are able to assimilate the producer’s stored energy. As a generalized trophic level consumers feed on all forms of organisms, and more specifically there are types of consumers by instinct or choice(herbivores, vegetarians, omnivores). Beyond the initial consumer there may be other consumers who derive their energy from consumers preceding them. Primary production provides for all trophic members as it provides energy to primary consumers that in turn provide energy to secondary consumers and so forth. In this way energy is transferred from one form and source to another. The efficiency for consumers to grow is limited by the use of their feed for a metabolic processes and their efficiency of conversion for digested food. The energy that is used for growth is assimilated into new tissue or reproduction and is the net production stored as a result for this process. On average metabolic processes utilize 90% of the gross energy intake, whereas assimilation utilizes 10%. The amount that is assimilated out of all the total energy intake is also the efficiency of conversion. The collective energy assimilated in one trophic level is the energy available to the succeeding level. There is consecutively less energy available to succeeding trophic levels. Consider a situation where 1000k calories are available to beef through grain feed and that their net production after consuming feed is 100k calories, only 100k calories would be available to the trophic level above, and beyond that 10k calories for the next. Industrial agriculture energy flows Agricultural production and consumption within the economy is the modern human ecosystem. This system has been made feasible as industrial practices and transportation systems have improved, allowing for cost- effective production and distribution across scaled markets. The change of these scales is the expansion of the distance between consumer and producer and the increase in consumer population. Industrial production and distribution of agricultural resources utilizes non-renewable resources and harmful chemicals. As the scales of production and distribution have grown, there has been a corresponding increase in the use of non-renewable and chemical resources. Case study Consider our earlier situation where there is successively 90% less energy available to consecutively larger trophic levels. Say a collective of supermarkets must provide 10M calories (10,000,000 calories) to provide sustenance to a city, and are only providing meat and plant(processed and other preservatives are another case) products. If the collective were to only sell meat and create a demand for beef, they would cause an economic transaction that enables the production of meat wherein 100M calories of feed must be grown to produce 10M calories of meat. :\\\\text{Efficiency of Conversion for ingested food(ECI)} * \\\\text{Food Calories}=\\\\text{Net Production(Calories)} . : 100MCalories(feed) * 10\\\\% (ECI)(meet/feed)=10Mcalories(meat) . Whereas 10% of the calories from feed could fully provide for the city, 100% of it is used to produce meat. This magnification scales ramifications within unsustainable components of the production process. This is the scaled use of pesticides and non-renewable transportation fuels. Considering that 100Mcalories is grown to eventually produce meat: : 10MCalories=\\\\text{corresponds to}=1 pesticide/transportational.impact.vegetarian.city . : 100MCalories=10*pesticide/transporational.impact.vegetarian.city . The non- renewable resource and pollution impact of a city that consumes all meat is at least 10 times greater than that of a vegetarian city. This assumes that the city eats entirely unorganic meat, and that all meat is actually eaten instead of wasted. It must be recognized that food miles are unavoidable in this scenario unless the food is sourced from local producers. In real life there would be some uncertainty on the residual stock that is wasted. We can use the following to amount the carbon impacts of travel miles: : GeneralFormula.truckloads:Nec.intake(Calories)/Max.trans.capacity(Calories/Truckload)=Truckloads.Nec.Intake : GeneralFormula.truckload.Emissions:Truckloads.Nec.Intake(scalar)*distance(miles)*emissions(emissions/miles)=Emissions We can use the following parameters to compare the environmental impacts of the two cities: : 1 truckload =200 kcalories(200,000 calories); there are separate trucks for meat and feed; :that the meat facility is 600 miles from the city and the farm is 300 miles from the city; :each truck type must go back and forth(miles are already X2); #The vegetarian Scenario ##10Mcalories(city.veg.intake)/200kcalories(calories/truckload)=50truckloads ##50truckloads300miles0.654lbs(CO2/Mile) =9,810lbs\\\\text{ CO2 emitted}CarbonFund, \\"Assumptions on Calculations\\" \\"Carbon Footprint Calculator Assumptions\\" , 10.10.2011. #The Carnivorous Scenario ##100Mcalories(meat.fac.intake)/200kcalories(calories/truckload)=500truckloads ##500truckloads*.10(ECI)=50meatruckloads ##((500truckloads300miles)+(50truckloads600miles))0.654lbs(CO2/miles)=180,000 lbs\\\\text{ CO2 emitted} This comparison assumes that truckloads of meat and nutritional feed contain the same amount of calories, and does not take into account the energy cost of refrigeration systems, packaging, or other industrial processes that are involved(fertilization). This does not consider the other energy or emissions that are produced and used in the production of fuel. This does not account for the animal gases that could be produced based on the meat, nor the actual efficiency of the animal's specific Efficiency of conversion. The majority of these factors that are unaccounted for in the estimation increase the amount of energy resources that are needed. The parameters that labeling programs seek to expose about agricultural systems are travel miles, sustainable feed and organic production, and food system localization. These promotional parameters seek to encourage economic activity for reduced emissions through travel, reduced pesticide use, and the need to account for resources in a local manner. Humans within the agricultural ecosystem are the nth degree consumers and have the ability to make dietary decisions. As omnivores humans have the option to be primary or any successive degree consumers. By consuming plants instead of meat, humans can prevent pollution and other environmental impacts. This cause has prompted diets such as environmental vegetarianism. Material cycles reuse communities Thriftcycles and communal renting organizations: continuous consumption Conventional consumption as a process flows as products are constructed from scratch and are disposed of at the end of a chain of events. Products and resources within conscious cycles participate in the stages of a closed loop by serving a purpose multiple times. Resource exchange organizations such as Zolink, Swap.com, Thredup, BookMooch, NeighborGoods, and Reuseit are oriented towards exchange markets without the presence of an profiting body. Whereas some of these movements are non-profit organizations, organizations with private interests have been established such as Zipcar, Dim Dom Toys, and Buffalo Exchange. Although these organizations will allow more community members access to resources that were previously unavailable, collaborative consumption is believed to decrease the actual amount of resources that are consumed(purchased). Beyond the usual demands that are present to individual consumers in the consumer market, collaborative consumer agencies create a demand for products that are: *Durable and reusable, as so to last an extensive time. Products that have designed obsolescence are disregarded. *Widely accepted by the majority as a viable tool or apparel. *Versatile for many purposes without needing complimentary resources. for instance if a Ladder is too voluminous, then the user must rent another form of transportation to move it. A compactible ladder would be more adaptable in this renting scenario. *Low of liabilities. If a toy company has a track record of producing products with poisons, defects, or choking hazards then consumer collectives are taking a risk with purchasing their materials. The need for resources that can be continuously reused creates the need for more safe, sustainable, and consumer multiple-user friendly products. The organizations that are formed to coordinate the collective resource certainly procure the best resources, as a collective they are able to afford the resources as well. Finished consumer products within any market are made from materials that are created in specific conditions that permit a cost-effective creation. While this often reduces the cost as much as possible, it also increase the impact of the product through the globalized translation of sustainability and shipment miles. By collaboratively consuming, communities can not only afford better resources, but also avoid the impacts created by having every financially able community member consume the resource individually. Collaborative consumption is expected to change the market by *Lowering individual consumption. *Increasing access to products to financially unable people. *Reducing the need for production. *Providing for the need of something without embracing ownership. For example, providing for the need of a hole instead of the screwdriver that creates it. *Our interaction with products. Case study: libraries for continuous consumption Ecometrics can evaluate the impacts of tool libraries, where the communal use of libraries allows consumers to use collective resources instead of purchasing resources independently. This scales the impacts of the resource, or in this case the tool while still providing the same value to independent consumers. Whereas the actual value of the product is diluted in a conventional system by way that it is limitedly used for its given cost, the value of a product can be fully exploited by being used multiple times in a conscious system where the impacts of consumption are reduced by the amount of tools within the system. For the following, only generalized formulas will be used. Factors of consumption can be improved through employing rental systems where resources are shared: #Value ##The usage of a product over its entire lifetime ##The value gained from a product's purchase over its cost #Change in Storage Space ##The decrease in space used to store a product within a community ##The ratio of communal storage space to individual storage space #Waste impacts ##The amount of waste created within a community for a given category of product ##The externalized impact of producing a product Thus the factors of consumption can be evaluated for resources within a system of collaborative consumption. It can be observed that continuous consumption cycles extend the usage of a product for a longer lifetime and greater consumer base while reducing the negative environmental impacts of production. 1\\\\. The Value 1.1 The usage ratio of a product for its total owned or purchased lifetime. :Usage(time)/Lifetime(time) 1.2 The amount of value gained from its purchase over the amount of money spent on it. :Value=benefit.value/money 2\\\\. Change in storage space 2.1 The decrease in space used to serve a value, when library systems are employed. :Decrease.space(units.space)=unit.space(unit.space)*(num.users.individual.cons(scalar)-num.max.rent.units.stocked(scalar)) 2.2 The ratio of space that would be used by consumer if they were to purchase the tool themselves over the space that is utilized within a community to provide the same value that the product supplies. :Ratio.of.indv.space/rentspace=unit.space(num.users.individual.consumed/num.max.rent.units.stocked) :num.max.rent.units.stocked=max.users.per.day*max.rent.period*num.stocked/rent.period 3\\\\. Waste and Emissions Impacts 3.1 The decrease in communal waste for a given category of product :Decrease.waste.using.com.lib=waste.unit*(num.users.individual.cons(scalar)-num.max.rent.units.stocked(scalar)) 3.2 The ratio of waste that would be produced by the community of consumers if they were to purchase the tool themselves over what would be produced if collaborative consumption were employed. :Ratio.of.indv.waste.to.coll.rent.waste=(numusers.individual.consump/num.max.rent.units.stocked) 3.4 The externalized impact of not consuming an additional product. Considering that the product is made far away from the consumer, the impact of production is unobserved within a local production area :ext.impact.of.production.unit= emissions.energy.prod.unit+pollution.energy.prod.unit+emissions.material.prod.unit + pollution.material.prod.unit if the impact of externalized production has a global impact: : local.impact.of.prod=ext.impact.of.prod This is assuming that the number of units stocked provides for all the uses within a community, and that:num.max.rent.units.stocked=max.users.per.day*max.rent.period*num.stocked/rent.period. Thus the factors of consumption can be evaluated for resources within a system of collaborative consumption. It can be observed that continuous consumption cycles extend the usage of a product for a longer lifetime and greater consumer base while reducing the negative environmental impacts of production.

Background Before the election the Conservatives had a majority on the council with 21 seats, compared to 9 for the Liberal Democrats, 6 for Labour and 3 independents. Issues at the election included housing, with the Conservatives saying they would make more land available, council tax, where the Liberal Democrats attacked the Conservatives for a 19.9% increase, and waste collection, with Labour objecting to the end of large waste collection, which they said had led to fly tipping. The Liberal Democrats said they were targeting seats in the villages of Baslow and Taddington, while Labour said they were aiming for Darley Dale. However the Conservatives were guaranteed seats after the election, as 13 of their candidates faced no opposition, the highest number of any council in the country.

This election would choose the first full president since the country gained partial international recognition. Background The date was set by the parliament after the 2011 election was annulled by the Supreme Court after Alla Dzhioyeva was disqualified following allegations of electoral violations by Anatoly Bibilov. A deal was reached on 9 December 2011 under which the incumbent Kokoity stepped down at the end of his mandate and was replaced by Prime Minister Vadim Brovtsev as acting president. Though Dzhioyeva was previously barred from running again, she was allowed to register in the re-run of the election. However, Kokoity and his supporters reneged on parts of the deal, calling into question the stability of the compromise. Candidates No candidate participating in the 2011 election registered, including the previous leaders Dzihoyeva and Bibilov. There were four registered candidates: *Leonid Haritonovich Tibilov, candidate in the 2006 election. *David Georgievich Sanakoyev, human rights commissioner. *Dmitriy Nikolayevich Medoyev, ambassador of South Ossetia to Russia and backed by Russia. *Stanislav Yakovlevich Kochiyev, chairman of the Communist Party of South Ossetia and speaker of the Parliament of South Ossetia. Dzhioyeva did not register to run in the election after she was in hospital with allegations of being beaten and held against her will. Campaign Tibilov and Sanakoyev disagreed with former President Eduard Kokoity who said that South Ossetia would eventually be a part of Russia. Sanakoyev said: \\"In November–December [2011], it became very clear that those supported by Kokoity did not win. Everyone saw it.\\" Opinion poll A week before the election, an opinion poll by the IR media centre suggested Medoyev or Tibilov would win. Monitors In addition to Russian observers the election commission said that it would call on the Council of Europe. Results With 40% of the votes counted, Tibilov was in the lead with 42.5% of the votes, Sanakoyev followed with 24.6% of the votes, Medoyev was third with 23.80% of the votes and Kochiyev trailed with 5.62% of votes counted. First round turnout was over 65%, with expatriate voting still to be counted. Without an absolute winner the election was set for a run off. The second round occurred on Easter with 84 voting centres opening at 8:00 for the 35,000 registered voters. The preliminary result with 95.64% of the ballots counted, indicated Tibilov winning with 53.74%, or 15,257, of the votes, with Sanakoyev getting 42.98%, or 12,272, of the votes.

Landmark investigations  Mediapart has played a central role in the investigation and revelation of several major French political scandals, including: *The Bettencourt affair in 2010. *The Sarkozy-Gaddafi case case in 2012. Mediapart made public two official Libyan documents suggesting the existence of a €50 million transfer from the Libyan regime to Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign. *The Cahuzac affair in 2012. Mediapart made public an audio recording from 2000 compromising Jérôme Cahuzac, then France's Minister for the Budget, in a fiscal fraud case. *Former National Front candidate Jean- Claude Veillard's role in the payment of taxes to ISIS middlemen by Lafarge in 2013–2014. *The Benalla Affair. On 31 January 2019, Mediapart released voice recordings attributed to Alexandre Benalla and Vincent Crase which suggested serious offenses committed by the two. On 4 February 2019, the office of Mediapart was subjected to a raid which failed as Mediapart refused it on the ground that the warrant was not authorised by a judge. The raid was in connection with a new investigation concerning a breach of Benalla's and Crase's privacy, prompted by the office of the Prime Minister. Neither of the two have launched action against Mediapart for breach of privacy. Mediapart sees in the raid an attempt by the Government to reveal and intimidate the source of the voice recordings and to stifle journalistic rights to inform the public. Mediapart has never been subject to such a raid before, and received support from other press organisations and the European Federation of Journalists. The incident is reported by the New York Times and the Washington Post. *In July 2019, Mediapart revealed that €63,000 of public money had been spent by François de Rugy on the refurbishment of his official residence (including €19,000 on a dressing room), and published photographs of lobster and champagne dinners allegedly taken between October 2017 and June 2018, implying profligacy at the taxpayers' expense whilst he was President of the National Assembly. On 16 July 2019, Rugy resigned as Ecology Minister.

It culminates in a lagoon before reaching the Pacific Ocean about six miles northwest of Santa Cruz, California. History The creek is shown on the 1836 diseño of Rancho Arroyo de la Laguna which ran from Vicente Creek in the north to Laguna Creek in the south. Diseño del Rancho Arroyo de la Laguna Archaeological excavations at Sand Hill Bluff, just south of Laguna Creek, have produced evidence of ancestral Ohlone people occupation of the area since 5,400 B.C.

The creek arises at on the western flank of Ben Lomond Mountain in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Y Creek flows 1.6 miles to join Laguna Creek at stream mile 1.5. Reggiardo Creek joins Laguna Creek from the left (heading downstream) and is the largest named tributary. Ecology Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) utilize Laguna Creek historically and in the present, despite 100% diversion of the headwaters to the City of Santa Cruz and heavy cattle grazing on the upper reaches. Waterfalls about two miles from the stream mouth apparently are not an impassable barrier for migrating trout. The Laguna Creek lagoon may host approximately 675 steelhead smolts, providing freshwater refugia for them to attain large enough size for survival in the ocean. Although under current conditions, the creek is not good habitat for Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), they have been observed in the creek as recently as 2005. The silted in Reggiardo Creek Diversion and Laguna Creek Diversion are high priorities for the Santa Cruz Habitat Conservation Plan because of their impact on low flows for salmonid fishes, reducing flows by up to 45% in critically dry years. The lagoon, which was diked off and farmed for many years, also provides habitat for endangered Tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi). Levees constraining the creek and its lagoon were removed by State Parks over several years ending in 2010, and were restored using native plants.

According to some estimates, MS Paint Adventures was the longest collection of comics on the Internet, containing over 10,000 pages among its five series thanks to its frequent updates. The comics were written in serials, or \\"adventures\\", in a manner that parodied interactive fiction games. The characters' actions were originally driven by commands suggested by fans in the comics' official forum, but fan suggestions were eventually abandoned due to the size of the fanbase and the author's desire to tell a more coherent story. The comics tend to draw inspiration from video games, imitating and parodying genres such as RPGs and simulation games. They frequently reference other aspects of current internet culture. Despite its name, the site's comics have been created primarily in Adobe Photoshop, not Paint, since the second page of Jailbreak; Hussie decided after the first page that telling a story using Paint was not feasible. Over time, the comics have evolved from simple static images and captions to frequent animations set to original music, (denoted by a [S]) and occasionally to interactive games created in Flash and HTML5. One adventure, Homestuck, has given rise to a large fan community as made evident by the increasing amount of fan art and cosplay at comic book conventions. The rapid rise in the popularity of Homestuck has led to its recognition at the Toronto Comics Art Festival for two years running,\\"Update: New Exhibitors at TCAF, New Books, and some Cancellations!\\", Toronto Comics Art Festival website. Retrieved April 4, 2012. and it brought, on average, over 600,000 unique views to the site daily. An adventure game spinoff of Homestuck titled Hiveswap was released September 14, 2017 and was produced with funds contributed by fans of the comic via Kickstarter. This project raised nearly $2.5 million, exceeding its goal of $700,000 in a little under two days, at that time being the 6th largest Kickstarter drive. A sequel titled Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon was launched October 25, 2019. MS Paint Adventures is one of many webcomics which supports its author financially, formerly through the sale of merchandise on the online store TopatoCo as well through advertising, and the site's own store and record label, What Pumpkin. Music used in the comics is sold through Bandcamp In 2014 a majority of merchandise began a slow migration to We Love Fine. In October 2017, VIZ Media announced acquisition of the publishing rights to Homestuck, and their plans to republish the graphic novel adaptations of Homestuck starting in April 2018. On April 2nd, 2018, the site was updated to automatically redirect to Homestuck.com, although the majority of content on the MS Paint Adventures site is still available on Homestuck.com. Adventures Early adventures Jailbreak, the first adventure written by Andrew Hussie, was conceived as a forum game following an unnamed man as he attempts to escape from a prison cell. The first page of Jailbreak is the only panel of MS Paint Adventures that was actually created using MS Paint; Hussie created the rest of Jailbreak and later webcomics using Photoshop. Jailbreak was only drawn to a vague conclusion, and Hussie considers it unfinished, but wishes to leave it as is. Jailbreak was written entirely as a forum adventure, and the first suggestion anyone posted was taken, however ridiculous, leading to a rambling and haphazard story line. This led to the creation of the MSPA site and the closed format of later adventures. In 2011, a short official ending was added to Jailbreak as a callback during a notably lengthy Homestuck hiatus. The second adventure, Bard Quest, was an experiment in the creation of multiple, branching paths rather than a single linear storyline. In Bard Quest, Hussie provided choice hyperlinks in a choose-your-own-adventure format. It was the first adventure to be hosted on its own website, but was ultimately left unfinished due to the difficulty Hussie faced in maintaining the complex web of branching storylines. Bard Quest was updated from June 12, 2007 to July 6, 2007, after which the site was left on hiatus. Problem Sleuth A parody of interactive fiction games and the film noir genre, Problem Sleuth began by presenting three detectives who are attempting to escape from their respective offices, though the story quickly turned into a pastiche of video games and science fiction. Problem Sleuth ran from March 10, 2008 to April 7, 2009. Unlike its predecessors, it received a proper ending, becoming the first complete adventure. It is the second longest comic on the website so far, after Homestuck itself, with a total of 1,674 pages. Homestuck Homestuck is the longest adventure with over 8,000 pages and over 800,000 words. It ran from April 13, 2009 to October 25, 2016, and followed four teenagers as they play a reality-altering video game that brings about the end of the world. They must work with an alien species from another universe to create their own universe and essentially become the \\"owners\\" of the one created. Its basic premise is inspired by games like The Sims, Spore and EarthBound. As in Problem Sleuth, the adventure is characterised by time travel, mystery, a complex fictional universe, and frequent references to pop culture and previous adventures. Changes from previous stories include an emphasis on contemporary society, such as online gaming and Internet culture, which contrasts with the historical settings of Bard Quest and Problem Sleuth. Additionally, this adventure introduced complex Flash animations and games, many making use of music and assets contributed by other artists. This represented a step-up from previous adventures which exclusively used GIF images for animation. Ten major soundtrack albums have been released under the comic's own record label, What Pumpkin, in addition to fourteen side albums. Homestuck has a large following and fandom. Homestuck has been compared to James Joyce's Ulysses by PBS's Idea Channel, in relation to the webcomic's complexity and how the task of finishing it is an example of effort justification. Homestucks Adventure Game Kickstarter reached approximately $2,485,506 of a pledged $700,000 by the ending of the fund, and had 24,346 backers. The video game was expected to be released some time in early to mid 2015, but was delayed to January 2016 and then again to January 2017 until September 14, 2017 when Hiveswap was released. Hussie also stated that he will make an epilogue for Homestuck with Viz Media's help. Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff is a spin off of Homestuck. It is presented in a different format than the other adventures, formatted more similarly to that of a traditional comic, having multiple panels per page. Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff is the in-universe comic written by the character Dave Strider from Homestuck. It is also a source of a multitude of in-house memes and gags. The Homestuck Epilogues The Homestuck Epilogues is a partially canon continuation of Homestuck that began on April thirteenth 2019, and ended on April twentieth of the same year. This also is formatted differently from the other adventures, as there are no pictures. There are two different plotlines, a \\"more canon\\" one represented by meat, and a \\"less canonical\\" one, represented by candy. Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon is the most recent adventure launched on October 25, 2019. It is continuing the plot of Homestuck and its epilogues. The new webcomic is a collaboration between What Pumpkin and Snake Solution Studios LLP. It has a new writing team lead by Kate Mitchell and Andrew Hussie.

Originally Bessarabian peasants, the first Kogălniceanus accumulated wealth and, as owners of the Scrivulenii (Râpile) estate, climbed into the boyar elite. They were also important as skilled members of the Moldavian bureaucracy, and, through brothers Constantin and Enache, also made contributions to 18th-century Romanian literature. Their work was matched and surpassed three generations later by possibly the most famous member of the family, historian and statesman Mihail Kogălniceanu, one of the founders of modern Romania and of Romanian liberalism. Some of the 20th-century Kogălniceanus were politically significant, supporting either the Conservative or People's Parties. Among the latter category, Mihail's son Vasile Kogălniceanu is chiefly remembered for his activism in support of land reform. A generation later, the Kogălniceanu male line had almost died out, but, through the female descendants, the family had become related to other important political (formerly boyar) clans: the Sturdzas, the Ghicas etc. Origins The Kogălniceanu's ancestral home was in the Moldavian subregion of Bessarabia, more specifically in Lăpușna County, on the shores of the eponymous Cogâlnic River. Ion Mitican, \\"Romantica poveste a 'Casei cu absidă' (I)\\", in Ziarul de Iaşi, November 18, 2010Gorovei, p.6 As noted by author Neagu Djuvara, they were one of the few local families to make use of the suffix -eanu, traditional among the boyar clans of neighboring Wallachia, but virtually replaced by common unsuffixed family names among Moldavian notabilities.Djuvara, p.127-128 During the 19th century, the Kogălniceanus had a seal or crest which showed a flower, a sword and a comital crown.Cândea, p.164 According to Mihail Kogălniceanu, the first attested member of the family, and the first bearer of the name, was Ioan. He is described as a yeoman (răzeş), who had acquired property in Bujor and Călmăţui villages. Probably elevated to minor boyardom, Ioan earned his living as a scribe (diac), and purchased land in Moldavia-proper. This property, located in Fălciu County, was extended by Ioan's son, Vasile. In 1666, he purchased Scrivulenii hamlet, the family's fief (ocină), place of rest, and preferred burial ground during some 200 years.Gorovei, p.6, 7 Vasile Kogălniceanu's sons split the clan into three separate branches: Iachim's descendants fell back into yeomanry, while Sandu's accumulated wealth. Sandu himself was well integrated into the gentry, abandoning his office of scribe and rising to the rank of Captain in Moldavia's standing army. Vasile (d. 1750), who was also a Captain, moved to the Moldavian capital city of Iaşi, after marrying a local, and joined the staff of Moldavian Princes.Gorovei, p.7 His wife's dowry included a manor, opposite from Bârnova Monastery, where the family was residing around 1730. In autumn 1739, following the devastating Russo- Austrian-Turkish War, returning Prince Grigore II Ghica rented the Kogălniceanu home, which served as both his temporary court and the quarters of his administration. When Vasile complained about this burden, Ghica agreed to move out, and granted the Kogălniceanus a solemn writ: \\"forevermore may these houses be protected and defended and may this man and his prodigy inhabit them in peace, neither shaken nor disturbed by anyone.\\" Vasile's interest was always centered on Iaşi, for which reason Scrivulenii remained deserted and was partly occupied by squatters. From Neculai to Ilie Kogălniceanu Ilie Kogălniceanu in traditional boyar costume Vasile had several children, including Neculai, Constantin (ca. 1725–1775) and Enache Kogălniceanu (ca. 1730–1795).Gorovei, p.7-8 Constantin began his administrative career by serving Constantine Mavrocordatos, under whom he was Logothete charged with fiscal matters. Constantin's main achievement is his participation in the abolition of serfdom, carried out by Mavrocordatos in 1749.Gorovei, p.7, 10 Constantin Kogălniceanu's name was also attached to the three letters of protest that Moldavian boyars sent over to Moldavia's suzerain power, the Ottoman Empire, complaining about the issues of administration. Around the year 1753, he set out to reassert his claim over Scrivulenii, pressing Prince Matei Ghica to issue him an unequivocal land grant—Ghica did so, some three years later. The younger Enache was page (copil de casă), and Matei Ghica's rival, Prince Constantin Racoviţă, raised him to the rank of Third Comis (Master of the Horse).Gorovei, p.8 While his brothers acquired their own houses, he remained in possession of the Bârnova home. Enache followed the Prince to his new throne in Wallachia, and then to a new rule over Moldavia, where he presided over the Boyar Divan and the Aprod courts. With brother Constantin, he supervised the reconstruction of Racoviţă's palatial residence at Doamna.Gorovei, p.7, 8 The project was a success, but Racoviţă was deposed by the Ottoman overlord, and took Enache with him to the exiled court of Fener. Constantin, with the reputation of an exquisite administrator, went on to serve Prince Ioan Teodor Callimachi. Raised to the rank of Stolnic (1758), he had to tackle the economic downfall of previous reigns, and managed to replenish the Moldavian treasury by appointing his choice of Ispravnici (tax collectors). Callimachi also used Constantin in the aftermath of Budjak Horde invasions into Bessarabia. Appointed Sardar of Chişinău, he rebuilt the counties of Lăpuşna, Orhei and Soroca. During Mavrocordatos' return on the throne (1769) and the Russo- Turkish War, he was himself Ispravnic over Hârlău, Botoşani and Dorohoi districts. Like Enache, he had literary ambitions, and was noted as a Molière translator. Neculai's bureaucratic career was a discreet one: he was a scribe, a Pitar, an Ispravnic of Fălciu and Roman, and a Vornic at Câmpulung Moldovenesc. He pioneered the prosopography of ancient Moldavia, by financing translations from Old Church Slavonic (1750). From Fener, Enache took to collecting and translating historiographical and juridical records of the Moldavian past. A disputed theory identifies him as the author who continued the Pseudo-Amiras manuscripts to the year 1774, which would make him Moldavia's last classical chronicler. He made a comeback to Moldavia as the Medelnicer of Prince Grigore III Ghica, witnessing Ghica's violent overthrow and decapitation, and writing about the events in two ballads. His final years were spent at Scrivulenii, thereafter known as Râpile, involved in defending the Kogălniceanu property against other claimants. The main Kogălniceanu line was carried on by Constantin's son, Postelnic Ioan (or Ion) Kogălniceanu (1761–1800). An orphan, he was raised by the childless uncle Enache and Enache's wife Frasina, and was noted for acquiring a new family home, in the Muntenimea de Mijloc quarter of Iaşi. Ioan's son, Ilie (1787–1856), was a man with liberal ideas and Westernized tastes, who also played a part in the Moldavian administration apparatus and rose to the rank of Vornic.Gorovei, p.6, 8, 10 Ilie was married to Catinca Stavilla, daughter of a Romanian Bessarabian squire. Mihail Kogălniceanu, Dezrobirea ţiganilor, ştergerea privilegiilor boiereşti, emanciparea ţăranilor (wikisource) Her family was reportedly Genoese, originating in Cetatea Albă but later spread throughout Bessarabia. Also orphaned, Catinca had been adopted into the Sturdza family, and was thus connected to the reigning Prince Mihail Sturdza. Mihail Kogălniceanu and successors Mihail Kogălniceanu's portrait, in old age Mihail Kogălniceanu (1817–1891), the son of Ilie and Catinca, was a leading figure in 19th-century politics, credited as one of the founders of modern Romania and of its modern liberal movement.Gorovei, p.8-10 Educated abroad, with a wide range of intellectual contributions (historiography, education, political journalism, works for the stage etc.), he openly demanded modernization and the unification of all Romanians within and without Moldavia.Gorovei, p.9 In youth, Kogălniceanu was doctrinaire of the 1848 Moldavian Revolution, an abortive rising against the conservative establishment of Prince Sturdza, and became a fugitive; he returned later as aide to the liberal Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, and engineered some of the major reforms of the 1850s, including the abolition of slavery (1855). In 1859, as an activist of the National Party, he helped bring about the Moldo- Wallachian union of 1859, and thereafter served Domnitor Alexander John Cuza as government minister.Gorovei, p.9-10 He was one of the statesmen directly involved in drafting and imposing the land reforms of the 1860s, then, as Prime Minister of Romania, helped proclaim Romanian independence (1877).Gorovei, pp. 9–10, 60 He is also remembered for leading the moderate, liberal conservative, wing of the National Liberal Party, Sorin Radu, \\"Liberalii şi problema reformei electorale în România (1866–1914) (I)\\" , in the 1 December University of Alba Iulia Annales Universitatis Apulensis, Series Historica, Nr. 4–5, 2000–2001, p. 134 which he helped establish in 1875.Paul Cernovodeanu, \\"Punţi între două lumi. Britanici printre români\\", in Magazin Istoric, July 1995, pp. 40–41 Mihail Kogălniceanu was married Ecaterina Jora (1827–1907), widow of Colonel Iorgu Scorţescu, and had at least eight children from her.Guţanu, p.8 The statesman's favoriteGuţanu, pp. 8, 9 was daughter Lucia (or Lucie). She had four children from her marriage to A. Vârnav-Liteanu, and two more from her second husband, Gheorghe Beldiman. Her final marriage, to Romanian dandy and Conservative Party man Leon Bogdan, produced two daughters.Guţanu, p.8-9 During and after this last marriage, she was involved in rallying support for the Conservatives and, later, the People's Party, as one of the few women of that time to openly engage in political battles; she was also a noted philanthropist.Guţanu, p.9 Of her progeny, daughter Lucia Vârnav-Liteanu married administrator Constantin Crupenschi. Nelu Păunescu, \\"Nobilii nu sunt primiţi în audienţe\\", in Evenimentul, September 16, 2011 Through her son Alexandru Crupenschi's marriage with heiress Magdalena Sturdza, the Kogălniceanu descendants were intermarried with the Sturdza clan. Of Lucia Kogălniceanu's other daughters, Ana married an \\"Earl of Rome\\" (Count Russell-Killough), and Manuela a Ghica landowner. A Conservative Party politico and notoriously rich captain of industry, Mihail's nephew Grigore Kogălniceanu (d. 1904) married Adela Cantacuzino-Paşcanu of the Cantacuzino aristocrats. Silvia Craus, \\"Bijuterii mortale\\" , in Ieşeanul, March 7, 2006 She survived him by 16 years, playing the eccentric host to Iaşi's high society, before falling victim to an unsolved burglary-homicide in 1920. Mihail and Ecaterina Kogălniceanu had three sons. The oldest, Constantin, was a historian and diplomat.Gorovei, p.10 The youngest was Vasile Kogălniceanu (1863–1942). He was an expert in agronomy, an advocate of agrarian politics, and a proponent of universal suffrage, who was jailed by the authorities as instigator of the 1907 Peasants' Revolt.Georgeta Filitti, \\"România acum o sută de ani\\", in Magazin Istoric, May 2007, p.68; Gorovei, p.10 Elected to Parliament with People's Party support, he played a major part in the adoption of a new and extended land reform law.Gorovei, p.10, 60 Mihail Kogălniceanu's second son, Ion (1859–1892), was the only one to leave heirs.Gorovei, p.10, 60; Guţanu, p.8 His wife Adela, a Sturdza boyaress, gave him two children: daughter Jeanne and son Mihail. The latter is remembered for setting up, in 1935, a cultural association dedicated to the preservation of his grandfather's cultural achievements (Mihail Kogălniceanu Foundation). Cristina Chiţa, \\"Fundaţia Mihail Kogălniceanu\\" , in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library Biblioteca Bucureştilor, Nr. 6/2004, p.24 The venture involved other members of the family (uncles Vasile and Constantin), with noted support from literary and political figures: Nicolae Iorga, Mihail Sadoveanu, Gheorghe Tătărescu, Nicolae Titulescu, Gheorghe I. Brătianu, Ion Inculeţ etc. Mihail and his first wife Ana Leonida, a member of the aristocratic Yarka family, had a son, Ionel Kogălniceanu. Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, \\"Surprizele familiei Yarka\\", in Ziarul Financiar, March 28, 2008 From his second wife, Irina (Nineta) Duca, Mihail had Ilie Kogălniceanu, who, in 2001, was the only bearer of the Kogălniceanu surname. Both he and his mother were close to famed Romanian composer George Enescu and to Enescu's aristocratic muse , both of whom lived for a while at the Kogălniceanu villa in Iaşi. Carmen Pleşa, \\" 'Prinţesa iubită' şi Enescu\\", in Jurnalul Naţional, June 7, 2004 Having authored an account of Enescu's love affair, Ilie Kogălniceanu is also known for having researched his family's history and collected various documents.Cândea, p.15-16, 163, 164, 174 Notes References * Virgil Cândea, Mărturii româneşti peste hotare: creaţii româneşti şi izvoare despre români în colecţii din străinătate.

This bay (locally: Wiek) runs in a wide arc from Cape Arkona in the north, through the villages of Juliusruh and Glowe either side of the River Schaabe to the start of the chalk cliffs of the Stubnitz near Lohme. The bay is named after the Dutch admiral, Cornelis Tromp, who, in the second half of the 17th century, led numerous sea battles in the service of Denmark and Brandenburg. For example, he was the commander of the Brandenburg fleet, that landed near Neukamp near Putbus on 23 September 1678 – supported by Denmark – in order to drive the Swedes from the island of Rügen for a short period. On 8 August 1715, during the Great Northern War (1700–1721), the Danish fleet threw a Swedish supply flotilla out of the Tromper Wiek sending them back to Bornholm. The Swedish king, Charles XII is supposed to have watched this sea battle from Königsstuhl on Rügen, hence the name (which means \\"King's Chair\\").

Prelude  In October 1677, Mary Stuart, niece and possible successor of Charles II of England, married William III of Orange, concluding the rapprochement between England and the Dutch Republic, who had been at war with each other until 1674. Louis XIV decided to invade the Spanish Netherlands to counter a possible English military intervention against him. The Dutch expected an attack against NamurHistoire de Louvois et de son administration politique et militaire... page 490-.Histoire de Louvois et de son administration politique et militaire... page 492 But Louis XIV directed his troops towards Ghent, taking the city on March 9, and then turned immediately west in the direction of Ypres.  The siege  On March 18, the French, led by Vauban, started digging approach trenches towards the citadel. The city was defended by a Spanish garrison under Dom Francisco de Pardo, who ordered the surroundings of the city flooded.France historique et monumentale… p. 368. But the French had already advanced too much to be stopped by this action. The city was pounded by 22 high caliber guns and 12 mortars. After one week, the works had advanced so far, that Louis XIV ordered an attack in the night of March 24–25. The city was quickly conquered and the defenders capitulated by dawn. Only the citadel held out for one more day, after which the surviving 1600 valid men and 600 wounded also surrendered.Histoire de Louvois et de son administration politique et militaire... p. 493.  Consequences  In April, Vauban started reconstructing and modernising Ypres' fortifications, giving it the form that can still be seen today. Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières became governor of the city. In England, Charles II raised some 20 regiments to be shipped to Ostend, but then hesitated to go to war with France. In the meantime, negotiations started between France and the Dutch Republic, leading to the Treaty of Nijmegen on August 10.

The star field behind the black holes is being heavily distorted and appears to rotate and move, due to extreme gravitational lensing, as space-time itself is distorted and dragged around by the rotating black holes.Credits: SXS (Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes) project A binary black hole (BBH) is a system consisting of two black holes in close orbit around each other. Like black holes themselves, binary black holes are often divided into stellar binary black holes, formed either as remnants of high-mass binary star systems or by dynamic processes and mutual capture, and binary supermassive black holes believed to be a result of galactic mergers. For many years, proving the existence of binary black holes was made difficult because of the nature of black holes themselves, and the limited means of detection available. However, in the event that a pair of black holes were to merge, an immense amount of energy should be given off as gravitational waves, with distinctive waveforms that can be calculated using general relativity. Therefore, during the late 20th and early 21st century, binary black holes became of great interest scientifically as a potential source of such waves, and a means by which gravitational waves could be proven to exist. Binary black hole mergers would be one of the strongest known sources of gravitational waves in the Universe, and thus offer a good chance of directly detecting such waves. As the orbiting black holes give off these waves, the orbit decays, and the orbital period decreases. This stage is called binary black hole inspiral. The black holes will merge once they are close enough. Once merged, the single hole settles down to a stable form, via a stage called ringdown, where any distortion in the shape is dissipated as more gravitational waves. In the final fraction of a second the black holes can reach extremely high velocity, and the gravitational wave amplitude reaches its peak. The existence of stellar-mass binary black holes (and gravitational waves themselves) was finally confirmed when LIGO detected GW150914 (detected September 2015, announced February 2016), a distinctive gravitational wave signature of two merging stellar-mass black holes of around 30 solar masses each, occurring about 1.3 billion light years away. In its final 20 ms of spiraling inward and merging, GW150914 released around 3 solar masses as gravitational energy, peaking at a rate of 3.6 watts — more than the combined power of all light radiated by all the stars in the observable universe put together. Supermassive binary black hole candidates have been found, but not yet categorically proven. Occurrence Supermassive black-hole binaries are believed to form during galaxy mergers. Some likely candidates for binary black holes are galaxies with double cores still far apart. An example double nucleus is NGC 6240. Much closer black-hole binaries are likely in single core galaxies with double emission lines. Examples include SDSS J104807.74+005543.5 and EGSD2 J142033.66 525917.5. Other galactic nuclei have periodic emissions suggesting large objects orbiting a central black hole, for example in OJ287. The quasar PG 1302-102 appears to have a binary black hole with an orbital period of 1900 days. Stellar mass binary black holes have been demonstrated to exist, by the first detection of a black hole merger event GW150914 by LIGO. Final parsec problem When two galaxies collide, the supermassive black holes at their centers are very unlikely to hit head-on, and would in fact most likely shoot past each other on hyperbolic trajectories if some mechanism did not bring them together. The most important mechanism is dynamical friction, which transfers kinetic energy from the black holes to nearby matter. As a black hole passes a star, the gravitational slingshot accelerates the star while decelerating the black hole. This slows the black holes enough that they form a bound, binary, system, and further dynamical friction steals orbital energy from the pair until they are orbiting within a few parsecs of each other. However, this process also ejects matter from the orbital path, and as the orbits shrink, the volume of space the black holes pass through reduces, until there is so little matter remaining that it could not cause merger within the age of the universe. Gravitational waves can cause significant loss of orbital energy, but not until the separation shrinks to a much smaller value, roughly 0.01–0.001 parsec. Nonetheless, supermassive black holes appear to have merged, and what appears to be a pair in this intermediate range has been observed, in PKS 1302-102. The question of how this happens is the \\"final parsec problem\\". A number of solutions to the final parsec problem have been proposed. Most involve mechanisms to bring additional matter, either stars or gas, close enough to the binary pair to extract energy from the binary and cause it to shrink. If enough stars pass close by to the orbiting pair, their gravitational ejection can bring the two black holes together in an astronomically plausible time. One mechanism that is known to work, although infrequently, is a third supermassive black hole from a second galactic collision. With three black holes in close proximity, the orbits are chaotic and allow three additional energy loss mechanisms: # The black holes orbit through a substantially larger volume of the galaxy, interacting with (and losing energy to) a much greater amount of matter, # The orbits can become highly eccentric, allowing energy loss by gravitational radiation at the point of closest approach, and # Two of the black holes can transfer energy to the third, possibly ejecting it. Lifecycle Inspiral The first stage of the life of a binary black hole is the inspiral, a gradually shrinking orbit. The first stages of the inspiral take a very long time, as the gravitation waves emitted are very weak when the black holes are distant from each other. In addition to the orbit shrinking due to the emission of gravitational waves, extra angular momentum may be lost due to interactions with other matter present, such as other stars. As the black holes’ orbit shrinks, the speed increases, and gravitational wave emission increases. When the black holes are close the gravitational waves cause the orbit to shrink rapidly. The last stable orbit or innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is the innermost complete orbit before the transition from inspiral to merger. Merger This is followed by a plunging orbit in which the two black holes meet, followed by the merger. Gravitational wave emission peaks at this time. Ringdown Immediately following the merger, the now single black hole will “ring”. This ringing is damped in the next stage, called the ringdown, by the emission of gravitational waves. The ringdown phase starts when the black hole approach each other within the photon sphere. In this region most of the emitted gravitational waves go towards the event horizon, and the amplitude escaping reduces. Remotely detected gravitational waves have a fast reducing oscillation, as echos of the merger event result from tighter and tighter spirals around the resulting black hole. Observation The first observation of stellar mass binary black holes merging was performed by the LIGO detector. As observed from Earth, a pair of black holes with estimated masses around 36 and 29 times that of the Sun spun into each other and merged to form a 62 solar mass black hole (approximate) on 14 September 2015, at 09:50 UTC. Three solar masses were converted to gravitational radiation in the final fraction of a second, with a peak power 3.6×1056 ergs/second (200 solar masses per second), which is 50 times the total output power of all the stars in the observable universe. The merger took place at 1.3 billion light years from Earth, and therefore 1.3 billion years ago. The observed signal is consistent with the predictions of numerical relativity. Dynamics modelling Some simplified algebraic models can be used for the case where the black holes are far apart, during the inspiral stage, and also to solve for the final ringdown. Post-Newtonian approximations can be used for the inspiral. These approximate the general relativity field equations adding extra terms to equations in Newtonian gravity. Orders used in these calculations may be termed 2PN (second order post Newtonian) 2.5PN or 3PN (third order post Newtonian). Effective-one-body (EOB) solves the dynamics of the binary black hole system by transforming the equations to those of a single object. This is especially useful where mass ratios are large, such as a stellar mass black hole merging with a galactic core black hole, but can also be used for equal mass systems. For the ringdown, black hole perturbation theory can be used. The final Kerr black hole is distorted, and the spectrum of frequencies it produces can be calculated. To solve for the entire evolution, including merger, requires solving the full equations of general relativity. This can be done in numerical relativity simulations. Numerical relativity models space- time and simulates its change over time. In these calculations it is important to have enough fine detail close into the black holes, and yet have enough volume to determine the gravitation radiation that propagates to infinity. In order to make this have few enough points to be tractable to calculation in a reasonable time, special coordinate systems can be used such as Boyer- Lindquist coordinates or fish-eye coordinates. Numerical relativity techniques steadily improved from the initial attempts in the 1960s and 1970s. Long-term simulations of orbiting black holes, however, were not possible until three groups independently developed groundbreaking new methods to model the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of binary black holes in 2005. In the full calculations of an entire merger, several of the above methods can be used together. It is then important to fit the different pieces of the model that were worked out using different algorithms. The Lazarus Project linked the parts on a spacelike hypersurface at the time of the merger. Results from the calculations can include the binding energy. In a stable orbit the binding energy is a local minimum relative to parameter perturbation. At the innermost stable circular orbit the local minimum becomes an inflection point. The gravitational waveform produced is important for observation prediction and confirmation. When inspiralling reaches the strong zone of the gravitational field, the waves scatter within the zone producing what is called the post Newtonian tail (PN tail). In the ringdown phase of a Kerr black hole, frame- dragging produces a gravitation wave with the horizon frequency. In contrast the Schwarzschild black-hole ringdown looks like the scattered wave from the late inspiral, but with no direct wave. The radiation reaction force can be calculated by Padé resummation of gravitational wave flux. A technique to establish the radiation is the Cauchy characteristic extraction technique CCE which gives a close estimate of the flux at infinity, without having to calculate at larger and larger finite distances. The final mass of the resultant black hole depends on the definition of mass in general relativity. The Bondi mass MB is calculated from the Bondi-Sach mass loss formula. \\\\frac{dM_B}{dU} = -f(U). With f(U) the gravitational wave flux at retarded time U. f is a surface integral of the News function at null infinity varied by solid angle. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) energy or ADM mass is the mass as measured at infinite distance and includes all the gravitational radiation emitted. M_{ADM} = M_B(U) + \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^U F(V) dV. Angular momentum is also lost in the gravitational radiation. This is primarily in the z axis of the initial orbit. It is calculated by integrating the product of the multipolar metric waveform with the news function complement over retarded time.Thibault Shape One of the problems to solve is the shape or topology of the event horizon during a black-hole merger. In numerical models, test geodesics are inserted to see if they encounter an event horizon. As two black holes approach each other, a ‘duckbill’ shape protrudes from each of the two event horizons towards the other one. This protrusion extends longer and narrower until it meets the protrusion from the other black hole. At this point in time the event horizon has a very narrow X-shape at the meeting point. The protrusions are drawn out into a thin thread. The meeting point expands to a roughly cylindrical connection called a bridge. Simulations had not produced any event horizons with toroidal topology (ring-shaped). Some researchers suggested that it would be possible if, for example, several black holes in the same nearly-circular orbit coalesce. Black-hole merger recoil An unexpected result can occur with binary black holes that merge, in that the gravitational waves carry momentum and the merging black-hole pair accelerates seemingly violating Newton's third law. The center of gravity can add over 1000 km/s of kick velocity. The greatest kick velocities (approaching 5000 km/s) occur for equal-mass and equal-spin-magnitude black-hole binaries, when the spins directions are optimally oriented to be counter-aligned, parallel to the orbital plane or nearly aligned with the orbital angular momentum. This is enough to escape large galaxies. With more likely orientations a smaller effect takes place, perhaps only a few hundred kilometers per second. This sort of speed will eject merging binary black holes from globular clusters, thus preventing the formation of massive black holes in globular cluster cores. In turn this reduces the chances of subsequent mergers, and thus the chance of detecting gravitational waves. For non spinning black holes a maximum recoil velocity of 175 km/s occurs for masses in the ratio of five to one. When spins are aligned in the orbital plane a recoil of 5000 km/s is possible with two identical black holes. Parameters that may be of interest include the point at which the black holes merge, the mass ratio which produces maximum kick, and how much mass/energy is radiated via gravitational waves. In a head-on collision this fraction is calculated at 0.002 or 0.2%. One of the best candidates of the recoiled supermassive black holes is CXO J101527.2+625911.  Halo drive for space travel  It has been hypothesized that binary black holes could transfer energy and momentum to a spacecraft using a \\"halo drive\\", exploiting the holographic reflection created by a set of null geodesics looping behind and then around one of the black holes before returning to the spacecraft. The reflection passing through these null geodesics would form one end of a laser cavity, with a mirror on the spacecraft forming the other end of the laser cavity. Even a planet-sized spacecraft would thereby accelerate to speeds exceeding the approaching black hole's relative speed. If true, a network of these binary black holes might permit travel across the galaxy.

Early life and education Chowdhury was born in Brahmanbaria of the then Tipperah district of United Bengal where his father was working as a civil servant. His father, Khan Bahadur Abdul Halim Chowdhury, was a district magistrate. He grew up in an atmosphere of liberal ideas and secular thinking. His family hailed from Chatkhile of Noakhali district of Bangladesh and his father was a devout Muslim free from any trace of religious fanaticism. Kabir's many close friends in school belonged to the Hindu community. When he studied English literature at the Dhaka University in the early 1940s he was greatly impressed by the writings of H.G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw and Bertrand Russell, among others. During the second World War he was deeply troubled by the Nazi atrocities carried out in their concentration camps, the mass killing of Jews as a plan of ethnic cleansing and the destruction of all democratic norms. Kabir's faith in democracy, secularism and liberal thoughts grew stronger by the day and he found himself drawn to socialist ideology. Educated at the universities of Dhaka, Minnesota and Southern California, Kabir Chowdhury worked for over half a century in the fields of education, peace and inter-cultural understanding in several national and international organisations like Afro-Asian Writers Union, Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organization, International Theatre Institute, UNESCO National Commission and Bangladesh Chapter of the World's Peace Council. Career Chowdhury has written extensively on world's famous writers and painters. He has also written extensively on peace and conflict resolution through discussion and has tried to promote these values by his work as a teacher and as an administrator. He taught at Dhaka College (Dhaka) and B. M. College, Barisal (as Principal) and few years at University of Dhaka as a Professor of English. He has worked as the Secretary, Ministry of Education, Cultural Affairs & Sports, Government of Bangladesh before his voluntary retirement from government service. He was inducted as National Professor of Bangladesh in 1998. Chowdhury was a member of the Presidium of the Bangladesh World Peace Council and headed the Bangladesh-Soviet Friendship Society for over a decade. He was the president of the Bangladesh Vidyasagar Society and chairman of the Advisory Council of Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee (Committee for Resisting the Killers and Collaborators of 1971). In all the above capacities he has significantly contributed to the dissemination of secular ideas and democratic values. His ideology is materialism. He has written extensively on anti-fundamentalism, religious fanaticism and communalism, and has stressed the need for developing broad human values and for realising the importance of cultural diversity, and the imperatives for developing a pluralistic society. In his long career, Chowdhury spoke at many national and international meetings of writers and social activists on literature, socialism, secularism and democracy. He addressed gatherings in Germany, Russia, USA, Bulgaria, Angola, Japan, Pakistan and India. He had the privilege of meeting Nelson Mandela, Yassir Arafat, Agostinho Neto and Kim Il Sung. In a conference of the World Federation of UN Associations held in Barcelona which he attended as the representative of Bangladesh UN Association (he was its chairman for several years), he worked alongside Nobel Peace winner Lord Philip Noel Baker and the distinguished pacifist Sean Mac Bride. Among famous writers, he worked closely with Pakistan's Faiz Ahmed Faiz, India's Visam Sahni, Palestine's Mahmood Dervish and USA's Edward Albee. Chowdhury played a leading role in many movements in Bangladesh, especially in the anti-communal movement, movement to establish democracy, and significantly in the movement to ensure the trial of those who had committed crimes against humanity and war crimes during the War of Liberation of Bangladesh in 1971.

The game is a downloadable follow-up to its predecessor, Alan Wake, but is not a sequel per se, rather serving as an in-universe spinoff. The game is an Xbox 360 title and was released on 22 February 2012 worldwide. A Microsoft Windows version was released on 22 May 2012 in North America, 29 June 2012 in Europe and 15 November 2012 in Australia. Like its predecessor, the game received mostly positive reviews. Critics praised the change of style and tone from the earlier themes of isolation, light versus darkness, and melancholy, utilizing psychological horror tropes, found in Alan Wake to the madcap, Pulp-influenced themes in Alan Wake's American Nightmare, utilizing black comedy tropes. Gameplay Alan Wake's American Nightmare makes use of the same combat mechanics found in the original Alan Wake: Alan has a flashlight, which must be focused on enemies before firing weapons at them. American Nightmare is more battle-focused, containing more ammunition and a wider variety of weapons, including a machine gun, a nail gun, a crossbow, and combat shotguns, among others. Some weapons are unlocked via cases found throughout the maps, which each require a certain number of acquired manuscript pages to open. Collectible pages were also featured in the original Alan Wake, though they had only served to provide an additional story element. The game also features an arcade mode, where Alan is set against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. New arcade maps are unlocked as they are successfully beaten, while available weapons are determined by the number of pages that have been recovered in story mode. Synopsis Setting and Characters Alan Wake's American Nightmare revolves around the titular Alan Wake, a former bestselling author of crime fiction. During a vacation to the small town of Bright Falls, Washington, Alan encountered a supernatural entity known as the Dark Presence, which forced him to write the manuscript of a horror novel which would give it power by turning the events of the story into reality. This occurred through the power of the Dark Place, a subjective alternate dimension located beneath the volcanic Cauldron Lake near Bright Falls. Alan was ultimately able to defeat the Dark Presence by altering the ending of the manuscript, freeing Bright Falls and destroying the Dark Presence but trapping Alan within the Dark Place. Alan Wake's American Nightmare focuses on Mr. Scratch, a doppelgänger of Alan created by the power of Cauldron Lake. During the events of the game, it is revealed that Mr. Scratch was created when false rumors spread of Alan following his disappearance; the power of the Dark Place turned this misinformation into reality in the form of Mr. Scratch, who thus represents a negative, purely evil version of Alan. Mr. Scratch serves an unknown entity from the Dark Place, and seeks to use its power to plunge the Earth into darkness. Alan seeks to defeat Mr. Scratch in order to protect humanity, particularly his wife, Alice Wake. Like the Dark Presence, Mr. Scratch has the power to possess human beings and turn them into \\"Taken,\\" monstrosities which can only be killed when light is shined on them. The game takes place in Night Springs, a fictional town brought to life by Alan's writings. Within the town, Alan encounters several denizens who aid him in his mission to stop Mr. Scratch, including auto mechanic Emma Sloan, astronomer Dr. Rachel Meadows, and art curator Serena Valdivia. Other characters who make cameos in the game include Alan's friend and agent Barry Wheeler, and the Anderson brothers, heavy metal musicians from Bright Falls who aided Alan during the events of the first game, whom Barry now manages during their comeback tour. Plot The plot of American Nightmare is framed by the narration of an episode of the fictional TV show, Night Springs, which follows the style of The Twilight Zone and appeared on television screens throughout the original Alan Wake. The episode is displayed on a TV screen in the hotel room of Barry Wheeler, Alan's friend and former agent. The narration explains that Alan is attempting to chase down the \\"herald of darkness\\", Mr. Scratch, who is Alan's evil doppelganger created by a dark force. Scratch is determined to take away everything Alan loves, including his wife, Alice. Alan, as the \\"champion of light,\\" has the ability to rewrite reality, and was able to write his escape from Cauldron Lake in Washington. He ends up near the small town of Night Springs, Arizona, and learns that he has been missing from the real world for nearly two years. A nearby oil derrick erupts with hordes of Taken controlled by Mr. Scratch. Seeking light, Alan runs to a nearby motel, where he encounters Emma Sloan, who at first thinks he is Mr. Scratch, since they look identical. She tells Alan that Scratch was at the motel the night before, and provides Alan with a typewritten page, a way to alter reality to destroy the derrick and stop the Taken. Alan follows its instructions and alters the scene by the oil derrick, which causes a meteor to collide with an artificial satellite, sending it hurtling towards the Earth, where it then collides with the oil derrick. While Alan is away performing this task, the dark forces consume Emma. Following clues he found at the motel, along with a set of keys, Alan heads to a nearby observatory. There, Dr. Rachel Meadows, who also met Mr. Scratch previously, is tracking a mysterious signal sent just before the satellite was knocked out of orbit. Rachel tells Alan that Mr. Scratch was very interested in this signal, and Alan surmises that it must contain the key to defeating him. Before they can acquire the complete signal, the observatory's telescope is sabotaged by the Taken. After Alan repairs the damage, a portion of the signal comes through that translates into a page of a story: a new reality that Alan can presumably implement. The page points Alan to a nearby drive-in theater, where he meets Serena Valdivia, who is under the influence of the darkness. After freeing her by restoring power and switching the lights on, Serena tells Alan that Mr. Scratch is trying to prevent the sun from ever rising again. She gives Alan the security code to the projection room where he can change reality. Alan uses the incomplete message to try to set the new reality; however, as the message is only partial, the new reality does not take effect. Mr. Scratch appears, gloating, and sends Alan back in time to a few hours before. Alan realizes that Mr. Scratch intends to keep Alan trapped in the time loop forever, until he is finally killed and Mr. Scratch will be free to take over the world. Waking up again near the motel, Alan repeats many of the same motions. Emma and Rachel still have some deja vu of the previous loop's events, and have helped perform some of Alan's previous tasks for him. Despite his efforts to change events this time around, Emma is nevertheless consumed again by the darkness. Rachel is able to capture a longer portion of the signal this time, but it is still incomplete. When Alan returns to the drive-in theater, he is still unable to complete the new reality and is sent back in time again by Mr. Scratch. Alan repeats his actions for a third time, but this time, he is able to save Emma and gain the complete message from Rachel. He sets the correct series of events in the projection room, which triggers the projector to show a film made by Alice. Mr. Scratch appears again, but discovers that Alan has successfully written the new reality, and he is burned out of existence by the film. On the screen, Alan appears to reunite with Alice along a sun-lit shoreline; however, the narrator challenges whether these events actually occurred, or were merely a figment of Alan's imagination. In a post-credits scene, Barry wakes up suddenly, believing he has heard Alan's voice. Development On 9 May 2011, a sequel game was hinted at when \\"Alan Wake 2\\" was shown on Althea Suarez Gata's curriculum vitae. On the same day, the information was removed from her curriculum vitae. On 10 May 2011, Oskari Häkkinen from Remedy told Joystiq, who had leaked an announcement rumor, that the official announcement of this installment was coming. He stressed that it would not be considered \\"Alan Wake 2\\", but neither would it be mere add-on content. Häkkinen would not get any more specific than that. Spike Video Game Awards 2011 showed a new trailer for the game on 10 December 2011.Alan Wake's American Nightmare World Premiere  Video Game Awards  Free Video Clips  SPIKE It had been speculated that the game would be an Xbox 360 game named \\"Alan Wake's Night Springs\\". The first image for the game was released by GameInformer on 7 November 2011. Just before the Video Game Awards, IGN released a screenshot of the game, along with the official title. Following rumors that the game would be released for Microsoft Windows, Remedy announced in early May 2012 that the game will be available for the platform on 22 May 2012. This followed Remedy's port of the original Alan Wake to the Windows platform a few months earlier. Soundtrack Petri Alanko, the composer from the first game returns to score American Nightmare. Licensed music includes the song \\"Club Foot\\" by the British indie rock band Kasabian, which plays a pivotal role in the game's narrative. Poets of the Fall also compose two new songs; \\"The Happy Song\\" which is featured whenever Mr Scratch appears, and \\"Balance Slays the Demon\\" under the fictional band 'Old Gods of Asgard'. Reception American Nightmare has received a positive reception. IGN scored the game an 8/10, praising its production and action elements, but criticizes the sub-par story, the oddly written dialogue, and lack of suspense. In the first week of release, the game was the top-selling Arcade game on Xbox Live. Sequel Remedy Entertainment has stated that this is not the last Alan Wake game, and that a sequel is in development. In May 2013, Remedy confirmed they were not currently developing a new Alan Wake, instead focusing on a new game for the Xbox One called Quantum Break.

The first known example appears in the tenth century Siddur of Saadia Gaon; The best known include those by two Spanish authors of the Middle Ages; Isaac ben Reuben Albargeloni and Solomon ibn Gabirol and the French author Elijah ben Menahem Ha-Zaken. Etymology The name of the poetical form derives from the first word of its earliest example, . Two attempts to ascribe special meaning to that choice of term have been suggested:unsourced information on Hebrew Wikipedia page, retrieved October 13, 2015 # Chazal sometimes refer to biblical prohibitions as azharot. # The numerological sum of a condensed form of the word (אזהרת, instead of אזהרות) equals the number of commandments. Criticism Abraham ibn Ezra (\\"Yesod Moreh,\\" gate 2, end) compared azharot to counting medicinal herbs enumerated in medical works without knowing anything of their virtues. Maimonides claims in the introduction to Sefer HaMitzvot, his own prose enumeration of the commandments, that he was motivated to compose that work because of errors in the azharot. Deference to Maimonides' criticism led major rabbis (18th-century Rabbi Haim Yosef David Azoulai ; 20th-century Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef) to prefer reading Maimonides' prose list to the poetic azharot. In 1971, Rabbi Yosef Kapach composed azharot based upon Maimonides' list.

She is known for her studies of the flora of the Caucasus. The plant Allium schchianiae is named after her.  Biography  Anna Semenova Schchian was born on 9 July 1905 in Tbilisi to a family of teachers. Her passion for natural history led her to the agricultural faculty of Tbilisi State Polytechnic Institute, later named Tbilisi State University. In 1929 she moved to Armenia, where she took part in reforesting around the resort of Arzni. In 1933 she moved to work in the biological section of the Transcaucasian branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in Tbilisi, which in 1934 became the newly established Botanical Institute, Tbilisi. At this time she engaged in significant scientific research, including floristic and geobotanical expeditions across the Caucasus, working up systematic descriptions of complex genera and families, and defending a dissertation. A great deal of work was done by her on activities of general economic importance to the people of Transcaucasia, this included studying the certification process of winter pastures in a number of districts in the Azerbaijan SSR, conducting a geobotanical survey of the forests of the southern Caucasus, mapping and listing of the plants of region, and conducting research into wild fruiting trees of the forests of eastern Georgia. The results of this work appear in her collection \\"Useful Plants.\\" Of particular importance in Schchian's scientific career was her work in systematics. Her master's thesis, which she defended in 1944, was devoted to the systematics and geography of the Caucasian populations of grape hyacinth (Muscari), a work which remains scientifically current. Data from this research was included in various works, especially the eight volume Flora of Georgia (1941–1952), which Schchian helped to edit. Her doctoral dissertation, which consisted of a systematic investigation of the family Dipsacaeae in the Caucasus, was defended in 1974, and came to be widely cited in floras of the Caucasus region. A. S. Schchian gave lectures in Armenian on systematics and general botany at the Armenian branch of the natural-geographical department of the Pushkin Pedagogical Institute in Tbilisi. From 1975 she lived in Erevan and worked in the fields of systematics and geography at the Botanical Institute of the Armenian branch of the Academy of Sciences. In the fall of 1989 she participated in the publication of the Flora of Armenia by working up several complex genera. Towards the end of her life she helped to plan preparations for a Flora of the Caucasus. She has approximately 50 publications. The plant, Allium schchianae Ogan., is named after her.

Common names include Sand sea star (P. i. pontoporeus).Jones, Georgina. A field guide to the marine animals of the Cape Peninsula. SURG, Cape Town, 2008. Habitat and behaviour Starfishes of genus Astropecten live on mobile seabed (sandy, muddy or gravel seabed) and they remain largely buried under sediment during the day. During the late afternoon and the night starfishes go out to hunt mainly bivalve molluscs, which are their favourite preys. Astropecten irregularis it's a very common species in all kind of mobile seabed from 1 to about 1.000 m deep. This species is active and easy to find during the night, sometimes it is possible to find it in the late afternoon. Description This species live in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean, but the two populations show differences in superomarginal plates. In particular, the specimens of Mediterranean have superomarginal plates devoid of spines (they are considered by some author as the subspecies Astropecten irregularis pentacanthus) while Atlantic populations are provided with one spine for each superomarginal plates (they are considered by some authors as the subspecies Astropecten irregularis irregularis) or more spines (they are considered by some authors as the subspecies Astropecten irregularis serratus and by some others as a variety of Astropecten irregularis irregularis). This starfish has a well-developed and raised superomarginal plates and the specimens in the Mediterranean are totally devoid of spines. The inferomarginal plates are short, thin, fine-spines, highly mobile and white colour. Astropecten irregularis doesn’t keep these spines rigid and parallel to each other as the other species do. The arms make up among them, at their base where they join the disc, a very clean corner. The colour of aboral side is pink homogeneous, often violet in towards the end of the arms and sometimes there are many small darker spots in the central disc. Sometimes it has a bulge on centre of the disc that is highly developed in this species. This bulge protrudes from the sediment where the animal is hidden and it has respiratory functions (called \\"aboral-cone”). Usually it has diameter of about 10–12 cm with a maximum of 19 cm. It's a very common species in all kind of mobile seabed from 1 to about 1,000 m deep. Usually this starfish can be distinguished easily and safely from the others species of Mediterranean for superomarginal plates devoid of spines and from colour. Sometime it is confused with Astropecten aranciacus for the similar colour, but it’s always possible to distinguish the two species by a closer inspection of superomarginal plates and inferomarginal spines or by observations of the colour of the paxillae. Feeding Astropecten irregularis pentacanthus This sea star is a carnivore and feeds on molluscs, which it catches with its arms and then takes to the mouth. The prey is then trapped by the long, moving prickles around the mouth cavity. Synonymised taxa *Asterias aranciaca O.F. Mueller, 1776 (Synonym according to Sladen (1889))Mah, C.; Hansson, H. (2013).

It runs in a north–south direction from LA 8 in Colfax to a junction of local roads near Lake Iatt, north of Colfax. The route connects Colfax, the parish seat, with U.S. Highway 71 (US 71) north of town. Its extension north of US 71 connects to a sparsely populated area on the western shore of Lake Iatt. Route description From the south, LA 158 begins at an intersection with LA 8 in Colfax. LA 8 travels through town on Main Street, connecting to Alexandria via Boyce to the southeast and to Pollock due east. From this intersection, LA 158 proceeds northwest on 8th Street, flanked by the Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) tracks and a row of historic commercial buildings. After , the route leaves Colfax, and the surroundings transition to a rural environment. later, LA 158 curves to the northeast along Sugarhouse Bayou and crosses the KCS tracks. It then curves to the north and crosses a bridge over Bayou Grappe. Shortly afterward, LA 158 intersects US 71 at a point known as The Rock. US 71 heads to Alexandria to the southeast and Shreveport to the northwest. After making a very brief jog onto US 71, LA 158 continues northeast through a thickly forested area. After , the road curves to the east and continues for another to a junction with three local roads just west of Lake Iatt: Claudes Road (north), Rice Patch Road (east), and Viney Ridge Road (south). The route is classified as a rural local road by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). The section south of US 71 has an average daily traffic volume of 2,300. It has a posted speed limit within Colfax of at its southern terminus, increasing to at North Street and to at Foulk Street. North of US 71, the average daily traffic volume drops to 600 vehicles, and the route has a posted speed limit of . LA 158 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. History In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern route of LA 158 south of US 71 was originally part of both State Route 1 and State Route 5. Both were designated in 1921 by an act of the state legislature and were routed along established auto trails: Route 1 followed the Jefferson Highway throughout the state, and Route 5 followed the Pershing Way. At the time, the portion of Routes 1 and 5 running through Colfax served as the main highway connecting Alexandria with Shreveport and Ruston, respectively. In 1926, this became part of the original route of US 71, which followed Route 1 through central Louisiana. When US 71 was moved onto its current alignment bypassing Colfax around 1950, Routes 1 and 5 were moved along with it. The former alignment became State Route C-2116 until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. LA 158 was created in the 1955 renumbering, following the portion of the route between Colfax and US 71 as described above. The section north of US 71 leading to Lake Iatt was added to the state highway system later as an extension of LA 158. Future La DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \\"right-sizing\\" the state highway system, the entire route of LA 158 is proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function.

Most members of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae), to which it belongs, are tropical, but R. australis, like other species of Roscoea, grows in much colder mountainous regions. Description Roscoea australis is a perennial herbaceous plant. Like all members of the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, \\"pseudostems\\" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. Plants are usually tall, occasionally up to , with four to six leaves. The first two or three consist only of whitish sheaths, which may be speckled; the remaining leaves form a rosette and have blades usually long by wide (although lengths and widths outside this range are also found). The sheaths have small 'ears' (auriculate) at the junction of the blade and sheath where there is also a small ligule which extends to about . Flowers appear in May to July in the wild. The stem (peduncle) of the flower spike (inflorescence) is held within the leaves. The few flowers open one at a time and are purple or white. The bracts which subtend the flowers are shorter than the calyx. Each flower has the typical structure for Roscoea (see the diagrams in that article). There is a tube-shaped outer calyx which is spotted and pink-brown in colour, with a bluntly three-lobed apex. Next inwards the three petals (the corolla) form a white tube, protruding considerably from the calyx, terminating in three lobes, a hooded upright central lobe, about long by wide, and two narrower side lobes, about long by about wide, which are whitish at the base. Inside the petals are structures formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes): two lateral staminodes form what appear to be small upright purple petals, which are by , with a non-central vein; two central staminodes are partially fused at the base to form a lip or labellum, long by about wide. The labellum is split into two lobes at the end for about half of its length. The single functional stamen has a white anther, about 5–6 mm (0.2 in) long, with long spurs formed from the connective tissue between the two capsules of the anther. The seeds when they form are dark brown. Taxonomy Roscoea australis was first described scientifically by Elizabeth Jill Cowley, a botanist at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in 1982. The specific epithet australis means \\"southern\\"; the species occurs to the south of all other members of the genus. The type specimen was collected in 1956 by Frank Kingdon-Ward from Nat Ma Taung (Mt Victoria) at and is held at Kew. Evolution and phylogeny The family Zingiberaceae is mainly tropical in occurrence. The unusual mountainous distribution of Roscoea may have evolved relatively recently in response to the uplift taking place in the region in the last 50 million years or so due to the collision of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates. Species of Roscoea divide into two clear groups, a Himalayan clade and a \\"Chinese\\" clade (which includes some species from outside China). The two clades correspond to a geographical separation, their main distributions being divided by the Brahmaputra River as it flows south at the end of the Himalayan mountain chain. It has been suggested that the genus may have originated in this area and then spread westwards along the Himalayas and eastwards into the mountains of China and its southern neighbours. R. australis falls into the Chinese clade as would be expected from its Burmese origin. It is similar to two members of this clade, R. tibetica and R. wardii. It differs from both in possessing a corolla tube which protrudes considerably from the sheathing leaves; in addition, it has a broader upper petal lobe than R. tibetica and smaller flowers than R. wardii. Distribution and habitat Roscoea australis occurs in Chin State, Burma, growing at altitudes of in grassland and on mountain ridges in the Chin Hills, including Nat Ma Taung (Mt Victoria), where the plant collector Frank Kingdon-Ward in his last expedition in 1956 described it as being abundant on the southern face of the ridge of the mountain. It has also been reported to be an epiphyte. It is isolated from other species of the genus by some . Cultivation R. australis has been described as \\"not the easiest to grow\\" when in cultivation at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Only seedlings were being grown at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew when Richard Wilford wrote an account of the cultivation of the genus, saying that Roscoea species generally require a relatively sunny position with moisture-retaining but well-drained soil. As they do not appear above ground until late spring or even early summer, they escape frost damage in regions where subzero temperatures occur. For propagation, see Roscoea § Cultivation.

Then Gemeni and his gang search for the person who murdered his friend and kills him. This incident marks the start of their rivalry. Meanwhile, Gemeni meets Manisha Natwarlal (Namitha) and falls in love with her. To gain her affections, he goes to study in an evening college as her classmate, and eventually, she too falls in love with him. Gemeni and Ladda clash again for a market holdout. Using his brilliant tactics, Gemeni fools and wins against Ladda which drives him crazy. In the meantime, Vijayawada gets a new Police Commissioner in Narendranath Chowdary (Murali). He arrests both Gemeni and Ladda. Understanding their rivalry, Viswanath puts them in a private cell so they can beat each other to death and at the same time can put a finish line to rowdyism. But instead, Gemeni convinces Ladda to plead Narendranath Chowdary to give them a chance to lead a normal life. Gemeni's trick works and they both are given a chance. While Gemeni changes his life, Ladda does not change his life. He keeps on disturbing Gemeni and wants him to help him out in his business. But instead, Gemeni informs about Ladda and his activities to Narendranath Chowdary. So, now Ladda is in jail. Meanwhile, Gemeni tries to reunite with Manisha as he had changed now and eventually she does forgive him. After some months, Chowdary gets transferred as the transport DG of Andhra Pradesh and the new Police Commissioner, Kumaraswamy (Kota Srinivasa Rao) arrives, but to Gemeni's bad luck he is corrupt and releases Ladda from jail. Now, Ladda and the new Commissioner urge Gemeni to help him in his business. But, he still tries to stay away from them. Forcing Gemeni to return to his old business, he would later kill Gemeni's right hand and who's also a best friend to him. Then in the climax, Gemeni tricks the Kumaraswamy to kill Ladda. Then, Kumaraswamy is transferred as transport DGP and Viswanath becomes the new Commissioner of Police. The film ends with Gemeni starting to lead a fresh life with Manisha.

Pegasus, startled, struck a rock with his hoof, creating the spring Hippocrene on Mount Helicon.Adam, Alexander (1816); p. 394. The Pegasides The name pegasides (plural form of the Greek feminine adjective pegasis) literally means \\"originating from or linked with Pegasus\\".Smith, William (1849); p. 165. Hence, in poetry, the waters and streams of Hippocrene and other springs that arose from the hoofprints of Pegasus are called pegasides.Ovid, Tristia 3.7.15: \\"the stream of Pegasus\\" in the English translation; Martial, Epigrams 9.58.6. The Muses are likewise called pegasidesOvid, Heroides 15.27: \\"the daughters of Pegasus\\" in the English translation; Propertius, Poems 3.1.19: \\"Pegasid Muses\\" in the English translation. because the spring Hippocrene was sacred to them. Nymphs in general, if associated with springs and brooks, may be called pegasides:Smith, William (1858); p 534. thus pegasis, the singular form, is applied by the Roman poet Ovid as a by-name or adjective to the nymph Oenone, daughter of the river-god Cebrenus.Ovid, Heroides 5.3: \\"the fountain-nymph Oenone\\" in the English translation; Pegasis Oenone in the Latin text. Pegasis is used by the Greek author Quintus Smyrnaeus as the name of a nymph who had sex with the Trojan prince Emathion and gave birth beside the river Granicus to Atymnius. The latter was eventually killed by Odysseus in the Trojan War.Quintus Smyrnaeus, The Fall of Troy 3.300–302.Parada, Carlos (1997) s.v. \\"Nymphs: Pegasis\\".

It involves parallel thinking to analyse a problem, generate ideas, evaluate ideas, construct and critique a plan of action. The four thinking styles are – outsiders, dreamers, realisers and critics. In the first thinking style the group think as outsiders to gain an analytical, external view of the challenge. They then act as dreamers to brainstorm ideal solutions. They use divergent thinking to conceive creative and radical ideas. In the next mode the group adopt a realiser viewpoint. They act as pragmatic realists and use convergent thinking to review the ideas left by the dreamers. They select the best idea and construct a plan for it. The fourth viewpoint is that of critics. They review the plan made by the realists in order to identify weaknesses, obstacles or risks. They seek to improve the plan. The method is comparable to and an alternative to de Bono's method of the Six Thinking Hats. The difference is, that in the Disney method the sequence is constant, whereas the Six Thinking Hats can be used in any appropriate order.

It was characterized in 1988 by Dr. I. K. Jalili and Dr. N. J. D. Smith, following the examination of 29 members of an inbred, Arab family living within the Gaza Strip. Presentation Affected individuals commonly suffer from photophobia, nystagmus and achromatopsia. Other symptoms affecting vision may include night vision difficulties; optic disc pallor; narrow vessels; macular atrophy with pigment mottling; peripheral deep white dot deposits or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) alterations in the inferonasal retina; decreased foveal and retinal thickness; attenuation of retinal lamination; hyperreflectivity in the choroids (due to RPE and choriocapillaris atrophy); impairment of color vision; and progressive loss of vision with advancing age. In line with ameleogenesis imperfecta, affected members may display teeth yellow-brown in colour, dysplastic, presenting numerous caries; reduced enamel layer prone to posteruptive failure; and abnormality of morphology involving dentine. Genetics The Jalili syndrome is caused by different mutations all with a linkage at the achromatopsia locus 2q11 on the metal transporter gene, CNNM4. Sequence analysis of this gene within Jalili syndrome sufferers has identified homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for several different mutations in the CNNM4 gene.http://omim.org/entry/607805#0001http://omim.org/entry/607805#0002http://omim.org/entry/607805#0003http://omim.org/entry/607805#0007 Management Symptoms  Epidemiology The distribution of Jalili syndrome sufferers is varied. Instances, beyond the Gaza strip patients who characterized the syndrome, include a two generation family from Kosovo who presented in the first few years of life with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy and the hypoplastic/hypomineralized variant of amelogenesis imperfecta, a sister and brother from Kosovo who presented at ages 14 and 7 respectively with dysplastic and discoloured decidual and permanent teeth, and a five generation Lebanese family with two sisters and a male cousin presenting ocular and dental phenotypes akin to the Kosovan siblings. In 2009, new examinations of the original Palestinian and Kosovan families reported by Jalili and Smith in 1988 and Michaelides et al. in 2004, led to the discovery of five additional cases displayed across genetically unconnected families from varying ethnicities, leading to the proposal of the term “Jalili syndrome” by Parry et al.

It was last assigned to the 9th Weather Reconnaissance Group, stationed at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. It was inactivated on 8 June 1963. History The squadron conducted nuclear cloud sampling during atmospheric testing. The idea of atomic cloud sampling developed from atmospheric testing during Operation Sandstone in the spring of 1948. During the operation, an aircraft accidentally flew through an atomic cloud. An analysis of the radiation dosages received by the crewmembers was found to be minor and led to the realization that sampling could be accomplished effectively with manned aircraft. Analyses of samples collected from atomic clouds were considered the most accurate method of determining the efficiency and yield of a nuclear device. Air Force Special Weapons Center (AFSWC) scientists accompanied the squadron on sampling missions in order to assess effects on humans. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) recommended that the USAF establish an organization specifically for gathering cloud samples. In 1953, HQ, USAF approved a test squadron for sampling atomic clouds; the squadron was titled the 4926th Test Squadron (Sampling) and assigned to the 4925th Test Group (Atomic). The new squadron was created within AFSWC's 4925th Test Group (Atomic), as the group, up to that time, had assisted the AEC and AFSWP in nuclear weapons effects tests and had actually developed operational techniques for airborne sampling of the effects. These included in-flight laboratories to gather airborne data on test results, piloted and drone aircraft to sample radioactive clouds, safety aircraft to measure radioactivity in areas surrounding tests, and nuclear-cloud-tracking aircraft to establish fallout patterns. Initially using the F-84G Thunderjet, The B-57B Canberra was first used during Operation Teapot in 1955. By 1956, the B-57B was a staple of the AFSWC sampling program. In addition to the dedicated men of the 4926th TS, many aircraft and crews were pulled from operational squadrons around the Air Force to help formulate procedures to operate successfully in a nuclear environment, if necessary. Flying the B-57, the 4926th Test Squadron (Sampling) participated in many operations, the majority at the Nevada Test Site and the remainder at Eniwetok Atoll. In April 1961, shortly after Air Research and Development Command was redesignated Air Force Systems Command, the squadron was transferred to Air Weather Service and renumbered 1211.See Mueller, p. 292 With the end of atmospheric nuclear testing in 1963, the squadron was discontinued.

The name Yongjia is derived from the city of his birth, which is now called Wenzhou. He is also known by his nickname \\"The Overnight Guest\\" because of his first encounter with his teacher, Huineng. On a visit to Caoxi (漕溪), where Huineng's Nanhua Temple is located, Yongjia was convinced to stay just one night, during which his enlightenment was acknowledged. He supposedly died while meditating in 713. He is best remembered today as the author of the Song of Enlightenment, often known by its Japanese name Shodoka (證道歌). This work remains popular in contemporary Zen practice. Biography Yongjia Xuanjue was born in 665 in present-day Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, China. The city went by the name of Yongjia at the time, and he came to be named for his birthplace later in life. He began studying Buddhism at an early age as a monk in the Tiantai school and was given the dharma name Mingdao (明道), meaning \\"bright path\\". He was friends with Xuanlang (玄朗), who would go on to become the fifth patriarch of Tiantai. He settled at Lung-hsing temple in Wenzhou, where he remained teaching until his death in 713. He was prominent enough that after his death, the Emperor Xuanzong gave him the posthumous name Wuxiang (無象), meaning 'without phenomena'. His two works that survive today are the Song of Enlightenment and the Yongjia Collection. The Overnight Guest The story of Yongjia's brief first encounter with Huineng is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp. The tale tells of one of Huineng's students encountering Yongjia, and through conversation finding that his opinions were very similar to those of the great Zen teachers of the time. When asked who his teacher was, Yongjia replies that he had none, but rather he had attained his understanding from sutras, especially the Vimalakirti Sutra. Huineng's student then explains that one's understanding should be confirmed, to which Yongjia requests that he testify to his enlightenment. The student states that his own personal opinion is meaningless, and he should instead visit Huineng in Caoxi. Arriving at the temple, Yongjia walks around Huineng three times and then stands staring at him. Huineng comments on his lack of formality, to which Yongjia responds, \\"Since the question of incessant rebirth is a momentous one and death may come at any moment, I have no time to waste on ceremony, and wish you to give me a quick answer to this problem\\". Huineng suggests he \\"embody birthlessness\\" in order to overcome impermanence. Yongjia immediately displays understanding of this, but then readies himself to leave. Huineng asks if he is not leaving too quickly. Yongjia then says there is no such thing as 'quickly', for motion does not truly exist. Huineng asks why this should be the case, to which he responds that any distinction about quickness or slowness is an artificial construct. Huineng then exclaims that his interlocutor now truly understands the concept of birthlessness, but Yongjia cleverly asks if a mere concept, another form of artificial distinction, can really have a meaning. Huineng asks, \\"Who makes a distinction about whether there is a meaning or not. Yongjia responds, \\"Distinctions are meaningless!\\", and Huineng cries, \\"Excellent! Excellent! Now, just stay here a single night!\\" This is so that Huineng can officially confirm his enlightenment. And thus, Yongjia is known as \\"The Overnight Guest\\" because he proved his enlightenment to Huineng in one night. Despite this story, in the oldest version of the Platform Sutra found among the Dunhuang manuscripts, which dates to about 850 CE, Yongjia is not mentioned as a student of Huineng.
