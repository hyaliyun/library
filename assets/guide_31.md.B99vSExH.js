It is being produced by the Bavaria Film GmbH for the ZDF public TV network. The cost per episode is estimated at 425,000 Euros.  Concept  The series' main overall focus lies on the contrasting personalities of a rustic Upper Bavarian small town inspector and his frequently replaced city slicker colleague, who has usually been transferred to the town for mostly incomprehensible reasons. Despite all differences, the new colleague is always warmly received and quickly integrated into the team. Each episode usually starts with the discovery of a body. This is communicated to the investigators by the secretary Mrs. Stockl with the words \\"Es gabat a Leich!\\" (Bavarian dialect for \\"There is a dead body\\"). Due to the show's lighthearted nature, it is customary for episodes to feature a comedic side plot, which runs parallel to the central storyline and is usually resolved right after the main plot's conclusion. These side stories are almost always in no way connected to the murder investigation the main story commonly consists of and may feature any kind of potentially humorous scenario, from an unexpected lottery win to more general events like comedic occurrences at the police office or on a farm. This kind of general writing scheme is exceedingly characteristic for early- evening crime shows on German public television.

Production Even though the show is set in Hamburg, it was purely filmed in Munich. The network created the show as a rival to RTL's successful Hinter Gittern - Der Frauenknast. Die Rote Meile never matched the show in ratings, but was a success for the network itself. This led to the network's decision to move the show from Monday to Thursday nights for its second season. The move proved unpopular as the ratings declined. As one of the reasons, next to the move, was said that the death of main character Johnny Roland took the show's heart and the stories became meaningless. The production of the show ended in fall of 2000. About six months later the show was canceled.

The English Queen Victoria owns the domain of the eastern lands of Borneo. The occupying British forces are commanded by Lord James Brooke, oppressive and ruthless governor and father of the beautiful Marianna Guillonk, nicknamed \\"The Pearl of Labuan\\". The brave Sandokan is a young Indian prince who has lost his kingdom and title as result of the British annexation. Along with his friend Yanez De Gomera, Sandokan is now the ruler of the isle of Mompracem, a den of pirates who make constant attacks against British forces. One day Sandokan travels from the island of Malaysia to the lands of Borneo. Lured into a trap, Sandokan is injured in an attack, falls overboard, and is found and treated by the family of Lord Brooke. In fact, the governor does not know Sandokan personally, and mistakes the pirate for an Indian noble. Sandokan plays along with this deception, as Marianna and he have fallen in love with each other. The love between them is not meant to last for long, as Lord Brooke eventually discovers the truth and begins to pursue Sandokan.

It was written by the duo Salim‚ÄìJaved, consisting of Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. Played by Amjad Khan, he is depicted in Sholay as a dacoit with an evil laugh who leads a group in looting and plundering the villages in the region of Ramgarh. He has a sadistic personality and insists on killing whenever required to continue his status and to take revenge on his enemies. The character is considered to be one of the most iconic villains in Indian cinema. He was featured in the 1991 spoof Ramgarh Ke Sholay, with Amjad Khan portraying a parody version of the character.  Etymology  \\"Gabbar\\", the distorted nickname for \\"Gabra\\", comes from the word \\"Gabru\\". The term \\"Gabru\\", also spelled \\"Gabroo\\", means \\"a young, strong and handsome man\\",Gabroo meaning.Gabru meaning in Hindi. or \\"a masculine handsome guy\\", i.e. \\"dude\\" in English.  Development  Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen. Gabbar Singh was also inspired by larger-than-life characters in Pakistani author Ibn-e-Safi's Urdu novels, and by Dilip Kumar's dacoit character Gunga from the 1961 film Gunga Jumna. Sippy wanted to do away with the clich√©d idea of a man becoming a dacoit due to societal issues, as was the case in other films, and focused on Gabbar being an emblem of pure evil. To emphasise the point of Gabbar being a new type of villain, Sippy avoided the typical tropes of dacoits wearing dhotis and pagris and sporting a Tika and worshipping \\"Ma Bhavani\\"; Gabbar would be wearing army fatigues. Danny Denzongpa was the first choice of Gabbar but had to miss out because he was shooting for Dharmatma in Afghanistan. Amjad Khan was almost dropped from the project because Javed Akhtar found his voice too weak for Gabbar Singh's role but was later convinced. For his preparation for the role Amjad read Abhishapth Chambal, a book on Chambal dacoits written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri (actress Jaya Bhaduri's father). Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but Salim-Javed \\"felt he had the audience‚Äôs sympathy through roles he‚Äôd done before; Gabbar had to be completely hateful.\\"  Style of speech  Gabbar's language was a mixture of North Indian Khariboli and Hindi, which was something new for the audiences so the dialogues were an instant hit and are still popular in India. Javed Akhtar says that Gabbar seemed to acquire life and vocabulary of his own as he wrote the film. His sadism lies in his choice of words like \\"Khurach, khurach\\" (scratch) when he talks to Basanti (Hema Malini). His style of speech was inspired by Gunga from Gunga Jumna. In that film, Gunga speaks with a similar dialect, a mix of Khariboli and Awadhi.  In popular culture  Amjad shot to stardom with the movie. His mannerisms and dialogues have become an integral part of Bollywood lexicon. Sholay went on to become a blockbuster, and is the highest-grossing movie in India. Although the movie boasted an ensemble cast of superstars including Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan, he stole the thunder with his unorthodox and eerie dialogue delivery that was perfectly opposite to the total lack of empathy his character was supposed to convey. Even after four decades, people fondly remember his dialogues and mannerisms. He later appeared in advertisements as Gabbar Singh endorsing Britannia Glucose Biscuits (Popularly knowns as \\"Gabbar Ki Asli Pasand\\"), and it was the first incidence of a villain being used to sell a popular product. The role of Gabbar Singh was so deep-rooted in people's mind those days that Amjad Khan was known for the rest of his life by this role alone and wherever he went he had to speak some dialogues from the film to amuse the public because the dialogues are very popular among the audiences of Indian cinema. The BBC have compared the impact of Gabbar Singh on Bollywood to the impact that Darth Vader later had on Hollywood. According to Anupama Chopra, \\"He‚Äôs like Darth Vader in Star Wars, pure evil, utterly terrifying and a cool baddie‚Äù. In 2011, Amitabh Bachchan told a contestant on his Kaun Banega Crorepati TV show that when Amjad Khan visited their home, his son Abhishek Bachchan ran to him and said \\"Papa, Gabbar Singh aaya hai\\" (meaning: Father, Gabbar Singh is here!), and Bachchan had to convince his son that Gabbar was just a character played by Khan. Gabbar Singh has been a subject of parodies and jokes innumerable times in the popular Indian media. Filmfare named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema, In Jai Hind (1994) comedian Senthil says \\"Arre O Sambha\\" while appearing as a dacoit. Clip from 9:30 to 11:30. In 2012 film Gabbar Singh, the character has been referenced by protagonist Venkataratnam Naidu (played by Telugu actor Pawan Kalyan), nicknaming himself after Gabbar Singh's character. Constable Ram Prasad (Ali) is nicknamed 'Samba' after Gabbar Singh's sidekick. In the sequel Sardaar Gabbar Singh (2016 film), Pawan reprises his role, albeit with 'Sardaar' in front of his name, referring to the title given by Gabbar Singh's henchmen. Both Telugu films contain dialogues made famous by Sholay's antagonist, e.g. \\"Joh darr gaya... samjho marr gaya\\" (Whoever is afraid... they are dead). In the 2015 film Gabbar is Back, the protagonist Aditya Singh Rajput (portrayed by Akshay Kumar) resembles Gabbar Singh and he also nicknamed himself after Gabbar's character.

The show originally ran from 2006 to 2010. On April 1, 2016, the English-dubbed version is available on Netflix as School for Little Vampires, but it leaves in 2018. Characters *Oskar von Horrificus: Oskar is often seen as the hero and is one of the students at the school. Count von Horrificus is his uncle. Oskar tries to be a great student, but unfortunately he has a fear of blood and is therefore a vegetarian. He is still able to change into a vampire bat like his friends and often visits the human girl Sunshine because he has a crush on her and she feels the same. However, Sunshine doesn't know he's a vampire, as she is a skeptic. *Gothetta Gothetticus: (originally named Gruftine) Gothetta is the only girl vampire in the school and the most level-headed out of all the kids. She is a skilled botanist. Gothetta gets into trouble herself at times, but isn't as bad as Stoker. She seems to have feelings for Oskar and doesn't particularly like Sunshine. Gothetta is also as smart as Leechy (only not as nerdy) and is often seen as a big sister figure to Klot. She has long curly red hair in a ponytail with the sides of her head shaved (also known as a wolftail). One episode shows her as a human. In the English dub, she speaks with somewhat of a \\"Valley Girl\\" accent. *Stoker Grimtale Cryptcrawler II: Stoker is rather an anti-hero and a troublemaker at the school. He is often getting himself or his friends into trouble and suffers from the most bad luck of anyone else in the series. His name is obviously a reference to Bram Stoker, the author of the popular novel Dracula. Stoker is the most stereotypical-looking vampire of his friends, since he resembles Count Dracula and loves blood. He has a one-sided crush on Gothetta. In the English dub, he speaks with a Cockney accent. *Leechy von Lebanlos: (originally named Tinto) Leechy is a child prodigy who is very intelligent and often makes inventions for his friends.

His name is a pun, since he is an ash pile. Ashley often speaks about his vampire life and that he was the best one in all the land where he comes from. Ashley also often tells everyone things they should know about others, like why Lenny was upset for a while. He is often a source of comic relief. As a vampire, he had red hair and wore dark navy blue clothes. *Sunshine Polidori: A human girl whom Oskar has a crush on. Sunshine is a skeptic and is unaware that Oskar is a vampire.

Even though he is not a skeptic like Sunshine, he is also unaware of the fact that Oskar is a vampire. He has a brother who is a skeptic, but even though Sunshine is also a skeptic, she demands that her grandfather be treated with respect. His brother eventually becomes a believer when Gothetta and Stoker change into bats and scare him. Paulus Polidori is often thought of as a \\"crackpot\\". *Count Alarich von Horrificus: Oskar's uncle who works as the headmaster of the vampire school, He is always striving to make Oskar the best vampire he can be. His appearance resembles Gary Oldman in the 1992 film Dracula. *Professor Oxblood: A vampire teacher and the uncle of Ravena.

Plot introduction The book was published in 1941 and tells the fact-based story of Giorgio, a boy from Sonogno in the Verzasca Valley in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. In historical chronicles, the author had read of a ferry disaster drowning some 30 chimney sweeps boys (Italian Spazzacamini). The boys were sold to the City of Milan for poverty in the middle of the 19th century. The novel was started by Lisa Tetzner, and finished by her husband Kurt Held (actually Kurt Kl√§ber). Kl√§ber later published the novel Die Rote Zora und ihre Bande. Plot Giorgio grew up in the small Ticino mountain village Sonogno. His parents were poor mountain farmers. One day his mother broke her leg, Giorgio was sold as a boy chimney sweep to Milan, as the family had no money to pay for the medical treatment of his mother. A scar-faced man (referred to only as Der Mann mit der Narbe (The man with the Scar)), Antonio Luini, bought him for the sum of twenty Swiss Franks and gathered him and others to bring to Milan.Die Schwarzen Br√ºder by Lisa Tetzner. Carlsen, German Edition, p. 471 During his journey to Milan, Giorgio met Alfredo, who came from a village in the Misox. The boat capsized, drowning many of the boys; only a few made their way to the lakeshore, where they were picked up by Luini and brought to Milan. Giorgio was sold to Mr. Rossi, a chimney sweep in Milan, who was under the influence of his hard-hearted wife. Giorgio was humiliated by her son Anselmo and barely received enough to eat. Nicoletta, Rossi's deathly-sick daughter, helped Giorgio greatly, sharing her food and calming her mother. Giorgio soon met with other chimney sweep boys, and was received in the community of \\"The Black Brothers\\". Together, they withstood the attacks from the local boys called Die W√∂lfe (The Wolves). Malnutrition and hard work weakened Giorgio. While working in a clogged chimney, and breaking loose blocks of soot in the smoke of a fire still burning, he almost died. After falling and becoming unconscious, he was taken care of by a Ticino physician, Dr. Casella, who was attending a festivity at Mr. Rossi's house. Dr. Casella later encouraged Giorgio and his friends to flee Milan and seek help at his estate in Lugano. A few weeks later, Giorgio's friend Alfredo died of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. After his funeral, the two hostile groups of boys agreed to tolerate and to assist each other. When Anselmo accused Giorgio of stealing, the \\"Wolves\\" took Giorgio and his friends to the road that led to Switzerland. Giorgio was hunted by the Milan police, But the boys made their way to the neighboring Swiss border town of Lake Lugano. In Lugano, they met with Dr. Casella, who offered them accommodations in his house. Dr. Casella's influence also led to the arrest of Antonio Luini, after he had been identified by Giorgio. Luini was later sentenced to a long prison term. Nine years later, having become a teacher. Giorgio returned home to Sonogno together with his wife, Alfredo's sister Bianca. There, he reunited with Anita (who herself had married) and his entire family, including his father, mother and Nonna, who were all still alive and doing well. Adaptations =Film= * 2013 : Die schwarzen Br√ºder, a German movie directed by Xavier Koller. =Television= * 1984 : Die schwarzen Br√ºder, a Swiss mini-series filmed by director Diethard Klante. =Animated series= * In Japan in 1995, a 33-part animated series under the World Masterpiece Theater under the title Romeo no aoi sora was (Japanese „É≠„Éü„Ç™ „ÅÆ Èùí„ÅÑ Á©∫, Romio no aoi sora, literally: \\"Romeo's Blue Sky\\") directed by K≈çz≈ç Kusuba. Under the title Die schwarzen Br√ºder this was also broadcast in Germany. For this telling of the story, Giorgio's name was changed to Romeo, it is his father who falls ill rather than his mother, and Romeo enters servitude voluntarily. Alfredo has an expanded role in the tale as a lost heir to nobility; and this (rather than the resolution of Luini) drives the plot in the last half of the series. =Radio play= Heidi and Stefan Knetsch Richwien adapted the material for the radio version.

It took place on December 23, 2011 at the Manhattan Center in New York City. It was the tenth annual event in the Final Battle chronology, with the first taking place in 2002, but only the third to be broadcast live. All three Ring of Honor (ROH) championships were contested at the event. The ROH World Championship was defended in a rubber match between champion Davey Richards and former champion Eddie Edwards; Edwards lost their previous match in June 2011 but won their first encounter in March 2010. The ROH World Tag Team Championship was defended by Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team, consisting of Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas, against the six- time champions The Briscoe Brothers, Jay and Mark. The final championship match saw Jay Lethal defend his ROH World Television Championship against former champion El Generico and Mike Bennett in an elimination match. Also featured on the card was the wrestling return of Kevin Steen, after a year- long absence from the promotion. Four other matches make up the undercard. Production =Background= Final Battle was originally scheduled to take place on December 17, 2011, in the Grand Ballroom of the Manhattan Center in New York City, and tickets went on sale on September 17. The event was later postponed to December 23 and moved to the Hammerstein Ballroom within the Manhattan Center. As with all ROH's pay-per-views since 2009, the broadcast was live and over the internet. =Storylines= Final Battle featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from existing, scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains or heroes, or more ambiguous characters in scripted contests that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match on the pay-per-view. Davey Richards (right) after winning the ROH World Championship from Eddie Edwards; the two competed again for the championship in their third singles match The main event was for the ROH World Championship and saw Davey Richards defend against his American Wolves tag team partner, Eddie Edwards in their third singles match as opponents. In March 2010, the two met in the final of tournament to crown the inaugural ROH World Television Champion. Edwards won the match, leading to them both seeking more of a singles career and Richards began competing for the World Championship. In November, Edwards won the Survival of the Fittest tournament, which gave him the right to challenge World Champion Roderick Strong, which he successfully did at Manhattan Mayhem IV in March 2011. On the back of a nine match winning streak in singles competition, Richards was announced as the challenger for Edwards' title at the Best in the World 2011 iPPV in June. Richards won the match and became ROH World Champion. The following month Edwards saved Richards from a handicap beatdown at the hands of the House of Truth, but at the next event in a tag team match between the American Wolves and Richards' training students Adam Cole and Kyle O'Reilly, Edwards continually stomped on the head of O'Reilly after the match had ended because the timekeeper's bell had not been rung. Edwards went on to defeat both House of Truth members and O'Reilly in singles matches over the next few months and on the 29 October episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling was announced as the challenger for the World Championship. Edwards announced that to give him an edge, he had employed a new trainer ahead of the title opportunity. On the 12 November episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling the American Wolves wrestled the House of Truth (Strong and Michael Elgin), during which Edwards helped the team win with a dragon sleeper despite never having used the move before. This is a signature move of Dan Severn who was later revealed as Edwards' new trainer, despite Richards having previously sought his mentorship. The ROH World Tag Team Championship match saw Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) defend their championship against the Briscoe Brothers, Jay and Mark. At ROH's June pay- per-view, Best in the World 2011, Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team defended their championship in a four-team elimination match, outlasting all three other teams including the Briscoes. At the end of the match however, the Briscoes returned and assaulted the winners with chairs. On the October 1 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team expressed their desire to face the Briscoes for revenge and stated they would put their championship on the line if need be. ROH authority figure Jim Cornette denied them their wish, explaining that he did not want to reward the Briscoes for their recklessness. He did however, give them the chance to earn their contendership in a match against the All-Night Express (Rhett Titus & Kenny King). During the match, Jay Briscoe low-blowed King and pinned him. Cornette overruled the decision, saying that regardless of it being accidental or not, he could not award the team a Tag Team Championship match. He rebooked the match for a fortnight later, which the Briscoes then won. The final title match of the event was for the ROH World Television Championship. On the October 1 episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, El Generico defended the championship against Jay Lethal in a match that lasted the 15 minute time limit without a winner. Authority figure Jim Cornette hastily allowed for the rest of television time to be used if both competitors agreed, which led to Lethal becoming the new champion. He made his first defence on the October 22 episode against \\"The Prodigy\\" Mike Bennett which also went to a 15-minute time limit draw, though Bennett later claimed he had mounted Lethal and attacked him enough that Lethal had been knocked out and thus should have lost the match even though Lethal then reversed the mount to see out the remaining seconds; in the event, Bennett refused to continue past the time limit and began to proclaim himself the true champion. During Lethal's second defence, against Generico, Bennett came to ring side and during the match started posing with the championship belt. While the referee was distracted, trying to keep Bennett under control, Lethal had made a long pin on Generico that went unnoticed just before the time limit again expired. Amidst a brawl between Lethal and Bennett, Generico dived out of the ring on top of them. A week later, ROH announced an elimination three-way dance between the trio to decide the rightful champion. Bennet petitioned to have the match not officiated by referee Todd Sinclair, who he blamed for not awarding him the victory via referee stoppage during his draw with Lethal. Kevin Steen wrestled his first ROH match in a year, since Final Battle 2010, after a long storyline with Steve Corino The most featured non-title contest was a grudge match between Kevin Steen and Steve Corino. Two years previously at Final Battle 2009, Steen attacked his tag team partner of two years ‚Äì El Generico ‚Äì and became a crazed villainous character. Steve Corino, in Japan at the time, released a YouTube video which revealed himself as the reason for Steen's change in character as he believed Steen could achieve more on his own than with Generico's comedic demeanour. Steen and Generico feuded through all of 2010, leading to a Fight Without Honor at Final Battle 2010 by which point even Corino had become concerned with Steen's mental state and actions. In the match, Steen lost to Generico which meant he was forced to leave Ring of Honor. After this, Corino set about trying to atone for his actions by adopting a character similar to a recovering addict. In the middle of 2011 he announced he would be bringing his sponsor to ROH, who was also a former ROH roster member atoning for their actions. Though most fans expected Steen, at Supercard of Honor VI Corino unveiled Jimmy Jacobs, who led The Age of the Fall to various bloody attacks in 2007 and 2008, as his sponsor. At the Best In The World 2011 PPV Corino made another speech about reforming and introduced Kevin Steen from the crowd. Steen pretended to also atone before attacking Jacobs and then ROH's on-screen authority figure Jim Cornette. This began a long campaign of Steen trying to find his way back into ROH, appearing again at Death Before Dishonor IX and attempting to piledrive ROH's owner Carey Silkin, before being scripted to hack into the ROH forum a month later, which led to a new website under the Sinclair Broadcast Group's ownership of ROH. After weeks of fans chanting his name on Ring of Honor Wrestling, Steen eventually threatened legal action against Cornette. On the 3 December episode of Ring of Honor Wrestling, Steen met Cornette and Corino in the ring for a verbal confrontation. Cornette acquiesced to a match at Final Battle because of Steen's legal wrangling with the stipulation that if he can beat Steve Corino, he'll be reinstated as a roster member. Steen, meanwhile, demanded Cornette sit at ringside and watch so that he could gloat after his victory. There were several other matches on the card, including Roderick Strong issuing an invitational challenge to an unnamed opponent. He has vowed to show up the main event, contending he should be competing for the World Championship. Similarly, Tommaso Ciampa of Prince Nana's Embassy faction was scheduled in a match against an unnamed opponent. However, in the December 16 video newswire it was revealed that Ciampa's opponent would be former Embassy member Jimmy Rave. Rave made a speech in the video claiming he was going to use all the knowledge that Prince Nana taught him to end Ciampa's undefeated streak. Reception At the event itself, Jim Cornette stated that Final Battle had drawn the largest gate in ROH's history. The event was attended live in the Hammerstein Ballroom by 1,500 people. The show drew an estimated 2,000 buys on internet pay-per-view, a significant jump from the previous pay- per-view, Death By Dishonor IX. The increase was attributed to ROH returning to television in between the two pay-per-views.

In February, the Mexican revolutionary Lauro Aguirre drafted a plan to overthrow the government of President Porfirio D√≠az. Aguirre's cause appealed to the local Native Americans, such as the Yaqui, who organized an expedition to capture the customs house in the border town of Nogales on August 12. During the battle that followed, several people were killed or wounded and the rebels were ultimately forced to retreat, ending the conflict after one encounter. It is notable for being one of the final episodes of the American Indian Wars, and for having involved simultaneous participation from American militia and Buffalo Soldiers, Mexican infantry, and local police, all of whom participated in an inconclusive pursuit of the hostiles.Johnson, pg. 664-665 Background The conflict stemmed from resistance to dictator Porfirio D√≠az and his \\"anti- agrarian and anti-indigenous Mexican policies\\". It was propagated by the fact that the Mexican Army and the Yaquis had been fighting a largely uninterrupted war against one another for several decades prior to 1896. The war forced many of the natives to flee north into the U.S. state of Arizona, where they settled around Tucson and Phoenix, occasionally recrossing the border to fight the Mexican soldiers. D√≠az was known for censoring his critics in the media, which created unrest among the civilian population of Mexico and in the United States. At the town of Solomonville, in southern Arizona, journalist Lauro Aguirre and Flores Chapa established the anti-D√≠az newspaper El Independiente, and on February 5, 1896, they wrote the Plan Restaurador de Constitucion y Reformista. The plan claimed that D√≠az had violated the Constitution of 1857 in multiple ways and was mistreating native Mexicans, particularly by deporting them to the Yucat√°n. It also proposed free elections and the use of force to overthrow the D√≠az regime. The Yaqui and the Pima were long-time enemies of Mexico, so Aguirre had no trouble in recruiting local natives to support his cause. Uprising In March 1896, the United States government arrested Aguirre and Chapa because the Mexican consul accused them of conspiring to re-enter Mexico and engage in revolutionary actions, but both of the men were acquitted in federal court after the American consul's investigation concluded that they were innocent of any wrongdoing. However, the plan was signed by twenty-three people, including Aguirre, and one other man believed to be Tomas Urrea, the father of the revolutionary Teresa Urrea. Because Tomas Urrea had close relations with many of the people involved in the uprising, Teresa Urrea was suspected of being the mastermind. Sixty to seventy Yaqui, Pima and Mexican revolutionaries, many of them employees of the Southern Pacific Railroad, united in a rebel band calling themselves \\"Teresitas\\" to participate in a raid, with the goal being to \\"capture the arms, ammunition, and money in the Mexican custom-house at Nogales.\\"Garcia, pg. 173-176Ruiz, pg. 97-117URREA, TERESA  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)Garza, pg. 40-41 Nogales, Sonora, and Nogales, Arizona are immediately opposite each other on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, so on August 12, when the Teresitas attacked, the Mexican consulate, Manuel Mascarena, requested aid from the Americans in or around the American Nogales. A militia was hastily assembled on the Arizona side of the border and sent in to help rout the rebels during the battle. On the next day Brigadier General Frank Wheaton dispatched elements of the 24th Infantry. At least three men were killed in the fighting and several others were wounded, but other sources claim that seven Mexicans died while the Teresitas lost about the same amount. When the rebels retreated they were pursued by a posse of Sonoran policemen. The police eventually caught up with the Teresitas later that day and fought another skirmish which left the Mexican commander dead. On the day after that, a large force of Mexican Army troops, under the command of Colonel Emilio Kosterlitzky, joined in the pursuit while two companies of the 24th Infantry conducted their own separate operations. Both of the pursuing parties failed to catch up with the rebels, a portion of whom dispersed to their homes in southern Arizona. After that there was no further conflict, and the successful defense of Nogales was effective in suppressing the uprising. Aftermath Aguirre continued to print and circulate news critical of the D√≠az regime but in 1902 he was forced to leave his home in Mexico out of fear that D√≠az was trying to kidnap him. Aguirre continued writing in the United States and later attempted to take over the city of Ciudad Ju√°rez, but this plot was foiled. On September 11, 1896, Teresa Urrea publicly denied having had anything to do with the uprising, but Porfirio D√≠az held her responsible so he pressured the American government into moving Urrea from El Paso, Texas to Clifton, Arizona, away from the volatile border region.Huachuca Illustrated, vol 1, 1993: Fort Huachuca: The Traditional Home of the Buffalo Soldier See also *Yaqui Wars *Texas Band of Yaqui Indians *Garza Revolution *Battle of Nogales (1913) *Battle of Nogales (1915) *Battle of Ambos Nogales *Crawford Affair *Crabb Massacre References  * Category:History of Mexico Category:History of Arizona Category:19th-century military history of the United States Category:American frontier Category:Wars involving Mexico Category:Wars involving the United States Category:Wars involving the indigenous peoples of North America Category:Battles involving Mexico Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Battles involving the Yaqui Category:1896 in Mexico Category:1896 in Arizona Territory Category:Conflicts in 1896 Category:Arizona folklore Category:Wars fought in Arizona Category:Buffalo Soldiers Category:Yaqui Wars ","title":"Yaqui Uprising"},{"id":"33137131","text":"Tierarzt Dr. Engel is a German television series.

In the early days of the Roman Empire it was in the province of Gallia Belgica, but it later joined the neighbouring lower Rhine River border districts, within the province of Germania Inferior. Its capital was Aduatuca Tungrorum, now Tongeren. Like many other Roman administrative districts, it was named after the tribal grouping that lived there, the Tungri, although that name is not known from the area before it became part of the Roman Rmpire. Also like other such districts, it became the basis for a medieval bishopric, but the bishops of Tongeren moved first to nearby Maastricht and then to Li√®ge. This map shows the old Diocese of Li√®ge (in yellow) which evolved from the Civitas Tungrorum and probably had similar boundaries. The modern Belgian provinces of Li√®ge and Limburg are also shown. The red boundary that separates them is the modern language border between Dutch and French. The orange lines are modern national borders. Location The geographical boundaries of the civitas probably corresponded at least roughly to the area of the large medieval Catholic diocese of Li√®ge, which was reduced in 1559. In modern terms this large diocese contained approximately the Belgian provinces of Limburg, Li√®ge, Namur, and part of Luxembourg; and the Netherlands provinces of Limburg, and North Brabant. It also contained the medieval imperial city of Aachen, now in Germany. Many early medieval dioceses were based upon older Roman provinces. And it is known that this diocese saw itself as the diocese of the Civitas Tungrorum. However, doubts exist about exact borders, in this case due to the fact that the northern part of the civitas was for a long time pagan Frankish, and outside of Roman or Catholic influence. Edith Wightman, considering the question of the locations of the tribes Caesar originally met here, goes as far as saying that this region \\"had the least stable political situation of any within later Belgica, and since the pattern was repeated in the Middle Ages, bishopric boundaries are of no help\\". In modern terms, the region covered all or most of eastern Belgium. The southern part is generally treated as if it had the same boundaries as the later diocese. *East-southeast the territory apparently stretched as far as the Eifel area of modern Germany, near Pr√ºm and Bitburg, which included the territory of the Caeroesi tribe. These were in the civitas of the Ubii, with their capital at Cologne. *South-southeast, the diocese stretched into the northern part of modern Luxembourg, and bordered upon the civitas of the Treverii in Gallia Belgica, which had its capital in Trier. *In the south, it stretched into the Ardennes to approximately the modern border with France. Over this border was the civitas of the Remi, with their Roman capital at Rheims, within Gallia Belgica. *In west, the neighbouring civitas was that of the Nervians or Nervii, which stretched through what is now central Belgium, and had its Roman capital in Bavay in what is now northern France. In medieval times their territory corresponded approximately to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai, which once stretched as far north as Antwerp. *In the west, the civitas and its later diocese stretched towards the Dijle river, and then the Scheldt which it flows into, but might not have reached this limit in all areas. For example, it probably included Namur, and maybe also Leuven (which was in the medieval diocese), but it probably did not include Antwerp (which was not in the medieval diocese). There is less certainty about the borders of the civitas to the north and east, where pagan Franks settled in between the times of Saint Servatius and Lambert of Maastricht, leading to a possible disruption of administrative districts. *To the northwest and north, where the ancient Scheldt ran via the Striene to empty into the Meuse (Dutch Maas), the Menapii had lived during Caesar's time. Their Roman civitas appears to have ended near the Striene-Scheldt, and in their place were possibly new tribes such as the Frisiavones, Marsacii, Sturii, Canninefates and Batavians. The Batavians had their own civitas within Germania Inferior. So it is not clear if the Civitas Tungrorum reached to the North Sea, nor whether it reached to the old Meuse-Maas delta, as the later diocese of Li√®ge did. But it is likely, in any case, that the civitas reached into the modern Netherlands province of North Brabant. *To the northeast it appears that the Tungri's district reached into the northern part of the Netherlands province of Limburg, which is where the districts of the pagus Vellaus and the pagus Catualinus apparently were. It may even have stretched over the Meuse in places. On the other hand, in this direction also lay the Civitas Traianensis, inhabited by the Cugerni, and apparently also the Baetasii, which may have also stretched into this same region of the modern Netherlands. *Directly to the east, proposals differ concerning the border with the province of the Ubii, the Colonia Aggripensis, with its capital in Cologne. It is sometimes suggested that the southern part of Dutch Limburg must also have been in the civitas. But it appears the Sunuci, were in the province of Cologne, and that they lived areas such as Valkenburg, Voeren and Aachen, that were later within the church diocese of Li√®ge. So it has been proposed that the Meuse river was the border, and perhaps even Maastricht was not included. One proposal is that the civitas gained territory in Dutch Limburg already during late Roman times, for example when Germania Inferior was reorganised into Germania Secunda. Geography The territory of the Tungri is divided into three distinct geographical areas. *The north is a large sandy area known today as the Campine (Dutch Kempen). It was not highly fertile, or heavily populated. It contains marshy areas, and the water flows partly to the Scheldt in the west and partly towards the Meuse. In Latin this area came to be known as Toxandria, but in late Roman time it became almost empty of Romanized inhabitants, and was settled by incoming Franks. *A band in the centre of the civitas is hilly, loess ground. This contains the modern regions known as the Hesbaye (Dutch Haspengouw), Hageland, and Condroz. It has historically always been more fertile and more heavily populated. It was here that Roman civilization held out against the invasions of the late empire, and it is therefore here that the frontier was set between Germanic languages and Romance languages, the same as it is today. (Some claim that this pattern was fixed already before Caesar, originally having been a border between Germanic and Celtic languages.) *The south of the civitas is more heavily wooded and hilly and merges into the natural boundary of the Ardennes. Origins: the Tungri Concerning the Tungri, the name appears for the first time only when this area is part of the Roman empire. Some authors believe it represents a name used by new immigrants coming from the eastern side of the Rhine. On the other hand, Tacitus equated them to the same group of tribes who had been known as the Germani and had lived in the area in the time of the Gallic Wars of Julius Caesar, and been described by him in his famous Commentary. Tacitus claimed that \\"Tungri\\" was not their original name:- The Germani tribes which Caesar had earlier named in this region were the Eburones, the Condrusi, the Paemani (or Caemani), the Caeroesi, and the Segni.\\"Gallic War\\" VI.32 The biggest and most important tribe were the Eburones, and it is they who appear to have dominated all or most of modern-day Belgian and Dutch Limburg, with a territory probably covering all or most of the flat Campine (Dutch Kempen) northern part of this region, and stretching into neighbouring regions of the Netherlands, Wallonia and Germany. The other tribes are thought to have lived further south, in what is today Wallonia, or else just over the border in Germany - the Condrusi in the modern Condroz, near the Segni, and the Caeroesi in the Eifel forest region of Germany. The term Germani for these tribes requires explanation in order to avoid confusion. Caesar also referred to other tribes living over the east of the Rhine as Germani, and he called that region Germania, considering it their homeland. He may have been the first to extend the term in this way, which has now influenced many modern languages. So he distinguished the Germani in the Belgic area as \\"Germani cisrhenani\\", and treated the other \\"Germani\\" as the ones living in their real homeland, which some Roman geographers came to refer to as Magna Germania. Whether or not any of the Belgian Germani spoke a Germanic language in the modern sense is uncertain. The names of their leaders and their tribes for the most part appear to have Celtic origins, which is in fact also true of the neighbouring tribes across the Rhine in \\"Germania\\" at that time, such as the Tencteri and Usipetes. On the other hand, place-name analysis seems to show that a Germanic language was being spoken in this region by the 2nd century BCE, and there are also signs of an older substrate language in the Belgic region. (See Nordwestblock.) So Celtic, while influential culturally, may never have been the main language of the area. Apart from the Germani, the Atuatuci also probably lived in what would become the Civitas Tungrorum. Caesar treated them as a distinct people from the Germani although their ancestry was also in the east, because they were descended from remnants of the Cimbri. Because they had a fort on large hill, and their name may even mean \\"fort people\\" it is thought that the Aduatuci lived in hilly Wallonia, possibly near Namur. Ambiorix, one of the two kings of the Eburones, complained to Caesar that he had to pay tribute to the Aduatuci, and that his own son and nephew were kept as captive slaves by them.\\"Gallic War\\" V.27 But once in revolt against the Romans, he rode first to the Aduatuci, and then to the Nervii, searching for allies.\\"Gallic War\\" V.38 The Aduatuci and the Germani (in the narrow sense) participated in an alliance of Belgic tribes against Caesar in 57 BCE. Before that battle, information from the Remi, a tribe allied with Rome, stated that the Germani (the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi, and the Paemani; but not the Segni) had collectively promised, they thought, about 40,000 men. The Aduatuci had promised 19,000.\\"Gallic Wars\\" II.4 In 54 BCE, after the defeat of this alliance in the Battle of the Sabis, the Eburones and the Aduatuci rebelled again in alliance with the Gaulish tribes to their south and west, the Treveri and Nervii. The capital of the Eburones is named by Caesar as Aduatuca. It is possible that this is the same place as modern Tongeren (Latin Aduatuca Tungrorum), except that the term may simply mean \\"fortification\\". One reason for doubt is that Caesar seems to indicate that Aduatuca was near the centre of the Eburone territory, and that the main part of this territory lay between the Meuse (Dutch Maas) and the Rhine, while Tongeren lies entirely to the west of the Maas.\\"Gallic War\\" V.24 After some initial success, the revolt against Caesar failed, and he conquered the area. He states that he tried to annihilate \\"the race and name of the state of the Eburones\\", for their \\"crime\\" which triggered the revolt, of having killed his lieutenants Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta when they had demanded to be quartered amongst the Eburones for winter during a year with bad harvests.\\"Gallic War\\" VI.34 Ambiorix fled into the Ardennes, with some horse.\\"Gallic War\\" VI.33 Many others escaped towards the forests, morasses, and tidal islands of the coast. The other king of the Eburones, Cativolcus, killed himself \\"with the juice of the yew-tree, of which there is a great abundance in Gaul and Germany\\".\\"Gallic War\\" VI.31 The name \\"Eburones\\" (like other similar Celtic-based tribal names around Europe) is based on the Celtic word for the yew tree, and this might also be true of the later Toxandri. Roman empire Under the Romans, for example in the time of Augustus, the Tungri civitas was at first considered to be a part of Gallia Belgica. Later, probably in the time of Diocletian, it split out, away from their Belgian neighbours to the west, the Menapii and Nervii, to join with the territories which lay along the militarized Rhine border and become part of Germania Inferior \\"Lower Germania\\", and still later this was reorganized to become Germania Secunda. Many of the tribal groups which inhabited the west bank of the Rhine were dominated by immigrants from the east bank. To the north of the Tungri, in the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta in the modern Netherlands were the Batavians and Frisiavones and possibly still some of the Menapii who had been there in Caesar's time. To the northeast, in the bend of the Rhine, were the Cugerni, who were probably descended from a division of the Sicambri, and probably the Baetasi also. To the east of the Tungri were the Sunici and on the Rhine the Ubii, whose city was Cologne, the provincial capital. The Tungri, along with many of the tribal states of Germania Inferior, participated in the Revolt of the Batavi. Tongeren was a major town on several notable east-west Roman routes including Amiens-Bavay- Tongeren-Maastricht-Heerlen-Cologne, which was a very important route, and Boulogne-Kortrijk-Tienen-Tongeren, which ran just to the south of the modern main road running Tienen-St Truiden-Borgloon-Tongeren, through the villages of Overhespen, Helshoven, and Bommershoven. The more fertile areas south of these roads were more heavily populated and more fully Romanized. In the sandy north of the Civitas, the so-called Campine (Dutch Kempen) was less fertile, and less populated. Within the civitas Tungrorum, some information survives about sub-districts (pagi), each with apparent tribal names. Most of this information comes from military records, concerning units recruited from such areas. The civitas had at least three alae and four cohorts named after it, of which two cohorts were long stationed in northern England, near Hadrian's wall, where they and other Germanic units were moved after the Batavian revolt. *The first cohort is known from around ten different records, mostly connected to the Scottish border area, especially in Vindolanda. *The second cohort is known from two inscriptions, one in Birrens (Roman Blatobulgium) and one in Castlesteads, both near the Scottish border. The name of one of the Germani tribal groups has survived from Caesar's time until today, the Condrusi, who lived in the Condroz of Wallonia. Another survived into medieval times, the Caerosi who lived in the Eifel forest just over the border in modern Germany. A new name in Roman times is Toxandria the district of the Toxandri, which appears to have been in the large part of the civitas containing the sandy Campine region in the north, but possibly overlapping into the country of the Nervii, because some Toxandri also appear in cohorts of the Nervian civitas to the west. As with the Tungri more generally, whose name also appears for the first time under the Romans, either this was a new Germanic tribe entering the region, or it has alternatively been suggested that it could be a Latin translation of the name Eburones, whose name had been annihilated by Caesar. Both names apparently refer to the yew tree (Latin taxus). The pagus Catualinus apparently existed in or near Heel on the Meuse, which corresponds with Catvalium in the Tabula Peutingeriana map. The name appears to be linguistically Celtic. The pagus Vellaus, is associated with the name of the forest of Veluwe in the Netherlands. Some soldiers from this pagus erected a monument to a goddess named Ricagambeda (apparently a Germanic name), while they were stationed in Birrens in Scotland, as part of the second cohort of the Civitas Tungrorum. Because modern Veluwe is north of the Rhine, and outside the territory of the Tungri, their levy into the military is either a case where a Germanic tribe was recruited from outside the borders, or else it relates to another Veluwe such as the Groote Peel national park between Eindhoven and Venlo. Their name has been compared with the name Vellaus, the name of a god found in some inscriptions. (It has also been proposed that the Baetasi might have lived near Geetbets, on the Brabant- Limburg border, but it seems more likely that they lived in an area closer to the Rhine in modern Germany.) Map of the Roman Empire and Magna Germania in the early 2nd century Already during the Gallic Wars of Caesar, tribes of Germanic people were raiding over the Rhine, and many were eventually settled there. As Tacitus wrote, \\"The Rhine bank itself is occupied by tribes unquestionably German,‚Äîthe Vangiones, the Triboci, and the Nemetes. Nor do even the Ubii, though they have earned the distinction of being a Roman colony, and prefer to be called Agrippinenses, from the name of their founder, blush to own their origin.\\"\\"Germania\\" chapter 28 The tribes he mentions are all tribes mentioned by Caesar also, as having made attempts to cross the Rhine when he was in the area. The Ubii, were in the north, the region of the Eburones, and became the people of the region of Cologne and Bonn during Roman imperial times. The other three tribes had been invaders on the upper Rhine, closer to modern Switzerland. The Roman empire proceeded to form two new cisrhenane provinces named \\"Germania\\" on the Gaulish, western, side of the Rhine. *Germania superior was the more southern of the two provinces of cisrhenane Germania. It had its capital Mainz and included the area of modern Alsace, and the corner of Switzerland, Germany and France. *Germania inferior (\\"lower Germany\\"), ran along the lower Rhine and had its capital on the German frontier in Cologne. It included modern Bonn, Neuss, Xanten, Nijmegen, and the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta. Along the Rhine in Germania Inferior were not only the Ubii, but also other tribes who had crossed the Rhine into the empire - the Cugerni, thought to be a part of the Sugambri, and the Batavians, thought to descend from the Chatti. The origin of others such as the Marsacii, Frisiavones, Baetasii, and Sunuci is less certain, but they are all thought to be Germanic. At some point the Civitas Tungrorum, the district where the supposed original Germani had lived, became part of Germania Inferior. So the two Roman provinces named Germania, both mainly on the west of the Rhine, gave an official form to the concept of germani cisrhenani. The end of the era As the empire grew older, the pressure from Germanic tribes crossing the Rhine became greater, especially in areas closest to the Rhine. The northern part of the Civitas Tungrorum became depopulated, and was then settled by the Salian Franks, who referred to this territory by its old name of Toxandria. The area bordering the Civitas Tungrorum on the east, also along the Rhine, became the territory of the Ripuarian Franks. Eventually, the whole of the area of the old civitas became the central area of occupation of the Salian Franks. It was from here that their Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties proceeded to conquer a large part of Western Europe. As mentioned above, one way in which the old civitas survived was by its medieval Christian diocese, the diocese of Li√®ge, although its seat changed from Tongeren to Maastricht and later to Li√®ge. This diocese was however reduced greatly in the 16th century. Apart from historical records such as those discussed above, the old name of the Tungri now survives only in place names such as Tongeren and Tongerloo.

As of May 2015, it consists of 58 episodes in five seasons and is produced by regional German television channel SWR Fernsehen for the national broadcaster organization ARD (broadcaster). The first episode aired on January 16, 2010. Plot The series revolves around 10-year-old Greta Hansen and her family and friends. The Hansen family moves from the big city of Hamburg to a rural Black Forest village, and while 7 year old Lilie quickly settles in her new surrounding, Greta has a hard time adjusting to her new life at first. Her father Philip and mother Annette also struggle to settle in. Arranging the run down house they've moved into, establishing their new veterinarian practice, dealing with the villagers' skeptical reception - all this is a bit of a challenge for everyone. Gradually though, Greta begins to make new friends and to experience all kinds of smaller and bigger adventures with them. These adventures all have one thing in common: rescuing animals. Greta is a great animal lover and unfailingly keeps supporting their needs and interests, against all odds and obstacles. Jonas, practical and inventive son of mayor and local farmer Grieshaber, becomes her special friend and ally - together with even-tempered Celine who grows into a loyal partner in all of Greta's adventures. Bitchy and plotting Emma is giving Greta and her friends a hard time quite often, but even she has to acknowledge Greta's audacity and boldness from time to time... In the third season, the focus shifts to a new set of characters, as Greta's cousin Nelly Spieker moves into town and makes friends with the Polish kids Pavel and Paulina. At school, she has to contend with the bullies Gustav and Big Ben. In the fourth season, a new character, Jessie, is introduced, and Greta Hansen returns. In the fifth season, the mother Annette goes back to Hamburg to care for her sick mother, putting strain on the household.

During the course of the Expo, Twipsy could be acquired on the EXPO area on forms of merchandise, ranging from a stuffed plush toy, to apparel such as on T-shirts, mugs, watches and other souvenirs, in addition to those with the EXPO logo. Apart from that, stamps showing Twipsy were released, and full- sized versions of Twipsy were running around on the EXPO area and advertising for the EXPO in other countries.  Appearance  Twipsy has a drop-shaped, colourfully striped body and a demilune yellow head with a large turquoise- colored nose. The area around the eyes, the extension at the back of the head and the chin are black. He's wearing a pointed, high-heeled shoe as well as a rounded flat one. He also has a \\"normal\\" thin and an oversized orange arm (which resembles a wing).

Seven months prior to the start of the EXPO 2000, the series premiere was used to get children accustomed to the upcoming World Exposition, however it focused only on character backstory, and had no connection to the Expo. In the first episode, 13-year-old Nick was pulled by accident into Cyberspace. He then meets the colourful and feisty cybermessenger Twipsy, who introduces Nick to the virtual realm; of course Nick gets homesick and together, Twipsy sends him back to the real world, while inadvertently ending up there too. A modified scanner is since being used as a Transporter into the universe of the internet. Through way, many other children, for example Nick's 8-year-old sister Lissie or his friend Albert experience many adventures and get to know the cyberspace realm, and most of the time, for Twipsy to get to know the aspects of the real world, such as weather, or his newfound love (and gluttony) of food. The characters are displayed using computer graphics when they're residing in Cyberspace, and in the \\"real world\\" using conventional comic style. Apart from that, all people are nearly the same size and appearance as Twipsy himself.

It has been speculated to be one of the oldest cakes in the Taizhou region of China.\\"Huangqiao Sesame Seed Cake (ÈªÑÊ°•ÁÉßÈ•º).\\" English.taizhou.gov.cn. Accessed September 2011.  Description  Shapes of the cake include round, elongated, square, oval, bevel-shaped and triangular. In shops, Huangqiao sesame cakes for sale are generally circular and oval, and sweet and salty. Basic ingredients include flour, salt, yeast, caramel, pork suet, onion, sesame, alkali and lard. The liberal use of sesame seeds provides crunchiness and crispness, and gives the cake a golden color. Some cakes include fillings such as leaf lard, sugar, pork flakes, longhidou, sweet osmanthus, crab spawn, jujube paste and shrimp meat, and are considered a premium product. History Sesame cakes have a long history. The earliest record of this kind of sesame cakes is from a book of the Northern Wei dynasty, known as Qi Min Yao Shu, the first book on agriculture in Chinese history, written by the early agronomist Jia Sixie (). The book has a chapter specifically on \\"cake method\\". Also, Travels of Lao Can (), written by Liu E of the Qing dynasty also has a description of it. The origin of the Huangqiao sesame cake is unknown, but there are some stories popular in folklore. It is said that, in the Qing dynasty, a county magistrate of Rugao County passed by the county of Huangqiao and chanced upon its sesame cakes. After returning home, he could never forget the taste of it and had a strong desire for a second taste. However, these two counties were apart, and it was impractical to go to Huangqiao especially for the cakes there. He decided to send his corvee regularly to purchase a large quantity of these cakes. In addition, many personages from the vicinity of Huangqiao had written in praise for the snack. Zhang Lihui (), the main writer of the revolutionary opera Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy, was so taken with Huangqiao sesame cakes since childhood that he ate it in the morning, at noon, and at night. He said that it is far tastier than fish soup and any other food he had eaten. The Huangqiao sesame cake got its major claim to fame from the Battle of Rugao‚ÄìHuangqiao of 1946, from the Chinese Civil War. It was said that the communists owed its victory in that battle to the locals who provided the sesame cakes to the soldiers. This episode has been written into song as the \\"Ode to Huangqiao Sesame Cake\\" () which was sung throughout the country. While initially a simple snack meant for rations, great changes had taken place to it in sixty years so that it is now considered a national snack. Originally it was made of nothing but flour with little oil and sesame that people could not enjoy except special days. In contrast, nowadays Huangqiao sesame cakes take form in new shapes like rectangles and ovals, while the fillings have been enhanced with floss, ham, shrimp, shallot, diced chicken, sausage, etc. The cakes are also smaller, reflecting its transformation from a soldier's ration to the bite-sized snack today.

The episodes had a length of 52 (first season) or 46 minutes (second to fifth season). For subsequent repetitions of the episodes of the first season, the episodes were cut to about 45 minutes. In addition, they were provided with an alternative, shorter end credits sequence, which was also designed in a different font.  Plot  Dr. Markus Specht is a teacher with heart and soul, his private life is often behind the students. In the five seasons Specht is transferred frequently and experiences the quiet town of Celle, a boarding school on an island (Kr√§henwerder), the political situation shortly after the Wende in Potsdam and Berlin, and at the end of the series, the Bavarian countryside, again in a boarding school. The exteriors were mostly shot on the island of Scharfenberg in Berlin-Tegel, which also houses a Gymnasium (school type) with adjacent school farm. A few of the characters accompany him throughout the series, the pension owner Pia Kleinholz, which is later his stepmother, when she marries his father. She always follows the educator from town to town and buys new pensions where Specht lives. In the story, all kinds of school subjects are dealt with, while his students are mostly high school students and 15 to 18 years old. Subjects were truancy, drugs, career pressures on students, divorces, pranks, kidnappings, extortion, evil and good caretakers and much more. Specht itself is under some relationships, loses his beloved but increasingly due to the fact that it's more important than his students are often very demanding women. Specht is in every season and every change of school, first hated by his students, but then builds on a relationship of trust that sets it apart from other teachers.  Particular  The series is, in contrast to the L√ºmmel-Filmen mit Hansi Kraus depicted realistically. School life is not embellished, but not dramatized. This gave the series an extraordinary popularity, and it became a ratings success. However, the materials to the shallow end of the series have been implemented, the rate of one burst and the series was finally discontinued.

But this happens with obstacles. After a night with her gay boyfriend she finds out that she is pregnant by him. The reason why her boss at the tabloid newspaper where she works is not considered the father is that he cannot father children. Meanwhile, Paul meets his first great love, who even moves in with him and Clara. But the great love for Paul is not mutual and he separates from him. Meanwhile Clara is tormented by the thought of how and if she should tell him that she is pregnant by him. When she does tell him and he gradually decides to have the child, Clara loses the child.

ProSieben showed the first two episodes on January 11 and 18, 2007 at 8:15 p.m., but postponed the series' broadcast from January 25 to 10:15 p.m., after the ratings for the second episode had already fallen below the 1 million mark. Even in the new time slot, the production only achieved an average market share of 5.4 percent in the advertising-relevant target group, which is why the station felt compelled to wait until after midnight to broadcast the last two episodes.

The 1970 dystopian novel The Guardians (German title: Die W√§chter) is a piece of work by the English author John Christopher. He portrays the fate of Rob Randalls, a boy living in a two- class society. The novel was awarded the German youth literature prize in 1976. In 1985, Die W√§chter was made into a television series of six episodes with a runtime of 45 minutes per episode. The producing company was the Bavaria Atelier GmbH. The character Rob Randalls was played by Martin Tempest. The television series aired on the German television channel ARD from February until March 1986.  Plot summary  England of the 21st century is divided into two regions. One is the frantic and advanced Konurba, the other is the region in which humans live under pre-WWI conditions. The people of the two regions do not know each other because a fence marks the border of both sides. That is why both sides' population is suspicious of each other. Rob Randall, a boy from Konurba, lives together with father ever since his mother died. After his father died in an accident, the boy is sent to a public boarding school. But because of dominantly brutal customs Rob runs away from the boarding school. He decides flee to the region his mother grew up in. After arriving there Rob meets the son of country aristocrats, Mike Gifford who agrees to hide Rob in a cave. When Mike's mother finds the Rob she decides after initial hesitation to offer Rob to live with the family as an allegedly \\"nephew from Nepal\\". The boy is fast to settle into the life of country aristocrats and attends school together with Mike starting in September. There they get to know Daniel Penfold, an upperclassman who criticises social order. Whilst Mike is starting to develop an interest in Penfold's ideas, Rob confronts these ideas sceptically.  Interpretation  The author depicts a two-class society in this novel. The whole system is based on prejudices both groups of people have against each other. Christopher also shows what happens when something is seen as perfect and thus making people overlook their own mistakes. This denial of reality and prejudices are creating a social order in which people are happy on their own, showing no interest in others. The author wants to make the reader to question seemingly perfect conditions instead of accept them without a second thought.

The serial ran on the TV channel RTL from 29 January 1995, and was always shown weekly on Sunday evenings. There was one season containing 37 episodes. Westerdeich was the second Australian soap opera to be re-formatted for a European audience by RTL. The first was in 1992; the Grundy Organisation soap opera, The Restless Years (1977‚Äì81), was remade as Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten (Good Times, Bad Times), and this series is still running as of December 2019.

The breaches were a major scandal for the club, and resulted in the club being fined almost one million dollars (which was a record fine for an AFL team until Essendon in 2013), and restricted from recruiting players via the AFL Draft, both of which had lasting implications on the club's position. Investigation At the end of the 2002 AFL season, shortly before the 2002 AFL Draft was to take place, the Australian Football League announced that it had found the Carlton Football Club guilty of \\"deliberate, elaborate and sophisticated\\" breaches of the salary cap during 2000 and 2001. The breaches were related to \\"under the table\\" payments made outside the salary cap to four players: Craig Bradley, Stephen Silvagni, Stephen O'Reilly and Fraser Brown. The club had previously been found guilty of minor breaches of the salary cap, as had many other clubs in the league, but this was the largest and most systematic case of salary cap cheating that had been proven in the league's history. The AFL accordingly reacted with strong penalties. The club was fined a total of $930,000 (including $57,576 which had been suspended from previous breaches). The club was also stripped of several early draft picks in the 2002 and 2003 AFL Drafts, specifically: *Draft picks No. 1, 2, 31 and 34 from the 2002 National Draft *All draft picks in the 2003 Preseason Draft *Its first and second round draft picks in the 2003 National DraftIf the Cap fits ‚Äì Blueseum. Published 12 November 2006. Retrieved 21 September 2011. Carlton later earned a priority draft pick for the 2003 Draft, which it was permitted to keep, even though that selection took place prior to the first round of the draft. This was used to recruit Andrew Walker. Although the club was penalised, no individuals within the club were ever formally identified or penalised by the AFL's investigation. The Carlton Football Club stated at the time that the only people at the club who had knowledge of the breaches were president John Elliott, and directors Wes Lofts, Kevin Hall and Barry Stone. The players were never found guilty of any wrongdoing. Aftermath The penalties struck Carlton at a very inopportune time. Historically one of the most successful clubs both on and off the field, decisions made in the late 1990s meant the club was already struggling in both areas in 2002, and the impact of the penalties severely weakened the club's position for the next five or six years. On-field, the club had fallen from playing finals in 2001 to winning its first ever wooden spoon in 2002, after the retirements of many champion players from the 1990s. The loss of draft picks came at the time when the club needed them the most to rebuild its playing list. This resulted in the worst extended period of on-field performances in the history of the club, which as of 2020 is still ongoing. In the six seasons between 2002 and 2007, Carlton finished last three times, and five times in the bottom two. It was not until 2009 that the club had rebuilt its list sufficiently to return to the finals. Off the field, the club had already posted an operating loss of $500,000 in 2002, and its decision to invest in the upgrade of Princes Park was inopportune and ultimately extremely unprofitable, as the AFL increasingly moved games away from the stadium. After the penalties, the club's was not only forced to pay the $930,000 fine, but also (and, ironically) settle the under-the-table contracts it still had with Silvagni and Bradley. By 2005, the club was close to requiring assistance from the AFL's Competitive Balance Fund. To stay afloat, the club took a loan of $1,500,000 from the AFL in 2003 ‚Äì a loan which it was still yet to repay as late as 2009. The four directors implicated in the illegal payments were all removed from the club in the board election at the end of 2002. John Elliott was voted out as president, and the club sought to distance itself from him; the Elliott Stand at Princes Park was renamed the Carlton Heroes Stand. Carlton struggled to maintain off-field stability, with Ian Collins and Graham Smorgon both serving unstable tenures as president over the next few years, before Richard Pratt took over in 2007. It was not until Pratt's presidency that the club returned to a stable off-field position.

While already Die Schwarzwaldklinik was inspired by General Hospital, Rademann that time tried to transform the successful US-series Fantasy Island into a German version. As well as Fantasy Island, Insel der Tr√§ume sets on a tropical island (Kawaii) somewhere in the Pacific. Each episode was about a guest coming from Germany to that isle hosted by the older, always white-dressed \\"professor\\" Gregor Sartorius and his young daughter Sandra. Different from its American model (but according to Die Schwarzwaldklinik as a medical drama), it was openly presented that the island's visitors came there to become healed from a psychological problem. After a number of (therapeutical) talks with Sartorius or his daughter, the guests were brought to a mysterious waterfall, where they recognised during some kind of a vision the (true) reason for their problems. At the end of each episode, every guest left the island with a solution for his/ her problem or at least with a newly gained positive attitude towards life's complications. Although copying its concept of happy-ending drama stories garnished with pictures of beautiful landscapes, Insel der Tr√§ume could not repeat the success of Die Schwarzwaldklinik and was cancelled after the second season.

Formerly an IBM brand, Lenovo acquired the ThinkCentre desktop brand following its purchase of IBM's Personal Computing Division (PCD) in 2005. Following its acquisition of IBM's PCD, Lenovo has released M-series desktops in multiple form factors, ranging from traditional tower, to small form factor, and all- in-ones (AIOs). 2003 In 2003, IBM redesigned and re-launched their ThinkCentre product line. The first desktop released was an M-series desktop ‚Äì the M50. =M50= The first desktop in IBM's redesigned ThinkCentre line was the M50, announced in 2003.

PC World called the M52 desktop, \\"A corporate machine for the security conscious business user looking for stability and reliability\\". The M52 desktop was equipped with a 3 GHz Pentium 4 processors, an 80GB hard disk drive, up to 4GB of RAM, eight USB 2.0 ports, two serial ports, a Gigabit Ethernet connection, VGA output, and a chassis that did not require tools to open ‚àí a toolless chassis. 2006 The ThinkCentre M55, M55p, and M55e were announced by Lenovo in September 2006. =M55= The ThinkCentre M55 received a positive review from PC World, with the reviewer stating that \\"The Lenovo ThinkCentre M55 9BM is a compact and quiet business PC that keeps maintenance simple and makes upgrades easy. Its design and functions are well-suited to an office environment and we think it's a good choice for any business searching for a uniformed PC roll-out.\\" The desktop offered the following specifications: *Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 1.86 GHz *RAM: 1GB of DDR2 *Storage: 80GB Despite the fact that the desktop was capable of handling Windows Vista Business, it was preloaded with Windows XP. While the chassis was similar to previous ThinkCentre desktops, it was made smaller to fit better in office spaces. =M55p= The ThinkCentre M55p desktop offered the following specifications: *Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 *RAM: 1GB PC2-5300 DDR2 *Storage: 160GB 7200rpm SATA *Graphics: Intel GMA 3000 Integrated Graphics (256MB shared video RAM) *Audio: Intel HD Audio *Optical drive: 16x Dual Layer DVD reader/writer *USB ports: ten USB 2.0 ports *Operating System: Windows XP Professional It was described by About.com as being \\"a very solid system for business users\\" and a \\"general purpose PC\\" for consumers.

The price, the 90-day subscription to Symantec client security, and the lack of a DVD writer were listed as the cons of the desktop. 2007 The ThinkCentre M-series desktops released by Lenovo in 2007 were the M57 and M57p. =M57 and M57p= The ThinkCentre M57 and M57p desktops were announced in September 2007 by Lenovo. These were the first desktops from a manufacturer to receive a GREENGUARD certification. In addition, both desktops were EPEAT Gold and Energy Star 4.0 rated. They were also the first ThinkCentre desktops to incorporate recycled material from consumer plastics. The desktops were equipped with up to Intel Core 2 Duo processors, up to 2GB DDR2 RAM, integrated graphics, and up to 160GB hard disk drive. 2008 =M57 Eco and M57p Eco= The ThinkCentre M57 Eco and M57p Eco were announced by Lenovo in March 2008. These were eco-friendly versions of the M57 and M57p, which were released in 2007. The desktops were dubbed \\"eco\\" and had an ultra-small form factor with low power consumption. According to Desktop Review, the M57 used a fraction of the power needed by standard desktops, and a little more than that of an energy-saving notebook. The M57 desktop offered the following specifications: *Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 3 GHz *Graphics: Intel X3100 (integrated) *RAM: up to 4GB PC2-5300 DDR2 SDRAM *Storage: 160GB 7200RPM *Optical Drive: DVD Burner *Operating System: Windows Vista Business (32-bit) *Dimensions (inches): 11.8 x 9.4 x 3.2 *Weight: 7 lbs The M57p eco desktop had the same specifications as the M57 eco. =M58= The M58 and M58p were announced by Lenovo in October 2008.

The cons were listed as being the price and the lack of DVI ports. 2009 The ThinkCentre M-series desktop released by Lenovo in 2009 was the M58e. The Small Form Factor version uses a BTX motherboard. =M58e= Lenovo announced the ThinkCentre M58e desktop in March 2009. The desktop offered the following specifications: *Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 3 GHz *RAM: up to 4GBhttps://support.lenovo.com/bd/en/solutions/pd003645 *Graphics: Intel GMA 4500MHD (integrated) *Storage: 320GB *Operating System: Microsoft Windows Vista Business The desktop was EPEAT Gold rated and met Energy Star requirements. The M58e was also compatible with solar charger packs. PC Mag summarized its review of the desktop by saying \\"The Lenovo ThinkCentre M58e is a middle-of-the-road business PC, both in performance and features, though it does have the added benefits of Intel vPro and IT-friendly features. It's certainly worth a look if you need a PC environment that can grow with your business.\\" 2010 The ThinkCentre M-series desktops released by Lenovo in 2010 were the M70e, M70z, M90, and M90z. =M70e= The M70e desktop was released by Lenovo in 2010 with the following specifications: *Processor: 3 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 *Chipset: Intel G41 *RAM: up to 4GB 1066 MHz DDR3 *Storage: 500GB SATA *Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X4500 *Audio: Integrated HD audio *Operating System: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional (64 bit) =M90= The M90 desktop was released by Lenovo in 2010 with the following specifications: *Processor: 3.33 GHz Intel Core i5 *RAM: up to 4GB DDR3 *Storage: up to 500GB 7200RPM SATA *Optical drive: DVD reader/writer *Graphics: Intel GMA X4500 *Form factor: Small form factor (SFF) *Dimensions (inches): 10.78 x 9.37 x 3.07 The M90 desktop received the \\"PCPro Recommended\\" award upon release, with an overall rating of five of six stars. The desktop was summarized as, \\"Expensive but, thanks to superb design and power, worth the cash for demanding business users\\". =M90z= Also released in 2010, the M90z was an all-in-one (AIO) desktop released by Lenovo. The AIO desktop offered the following specifications: *Processor: 3.2 GHz Intel Core i5-650 *RAM: 4 GB *Storage: 500 GB *Graphics Card: Intel GMA HD *Optical Drive: Dual- Layer DVD reader/writer *Display: 23 inch HD widescreen (maximum resolutions of 1920x1080) *USB ports: 6 USB 2.0 PCMag listed the pros of the desktop as the compact design, HD display, support for two monitors, simple multi-touch interface, good component mix, stand options, and easy servicing. The cons were listed as the dull colors on videos because of the matte screen, the lack of an eSATA port, and the need for an adapter when using external DVI. Computer shopper summarized the capabilities of the M90z with the statement, \\"In our test configuration, the business-oriented M90z is overkill for most office tasks. Configuration options, however, can bring down the price while still delivering a peppy big-screen office PC.\\" 2011 =M71e= The ThinkCentre M71e desktop was described by PCWorld as being \\"a basic PC designed for small and medium-sized businesses\\". The desktop was powered by an Intel Core i5-2500 processor and included 4GB of DDR3 RAM, a 500GB 7200RPM hard disk drive, and AMD Radeon HD 5450 discrete graphics. The desktop was indicated to be good for everyday office tasks and offering suitable responsiveness. Despite the presence of three fans, the desktop was not \\"annoyingly loud\\". The DVD bay was powered by a strong motor; the drive tray would eject and close almost as soon as the button was pressed with very little lag. The desktop was, overall, described as being a simple machine with a decent configuration, without \\"fancy features\\" such as a USB 3.0 port. Some legacy features, such as a PS/2 port were available on the desktop. Also, the assembly of the machine was described as \\"basic\\", with a messy internal appearance. The one year on-site warranty was indicated as being one of the best features on the desktop. Other features on the desktop included four USB 2.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, DVI, Display Port, and analogue audio ports. =M71z= The M71z was described by IT Pro as being \\"a rare business all-in-one with a touchscreen.\\" The default configuration offered a non-touch screen, with multi-touch as an optional upgrade. The touchscreen was described as being precise and responsive, with Lenovo applications using suitably large icons. However, the applications themselves were indicated to have not been optimized for touch control. Further, there were no touch-specific applications commonly found on consumer touchscreen devices. The 1600 x 900 display was indicated to be \\"spacious enough\\" with acceptable color accuracy. However, the brightness level was indicated to be low, at 210.8 cd/m2. The processing and graphical power was acceptable for everyday office tasks, with the all-in-one powered by an Intel Core i3-2100 processor and Intel HD 2000 integrated graphics. The use of graphics- and processing-intensive software was indicated to be a challenge, because of the lack of discrete graphics. Power consumption, heat levels, and noise levels were low. IT Pro commented that \\"the fans never became irritatingly loud. In fact, we had to press our ears up against the computer to even hear them.\\" The build of the all-in-one was described as being good, with strong, matte black plastic. Both keyboard and mouse were called reliable, with the keyboard described as responsive. Detailed specifications of the M71z all-in-one are as follows: *Processor: Intel Pentium G260 (2.6 GHz) *Operating system: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) *Screen: 20-inches (non-touch by default; optional multi-touch upgrade) *RAM: Up to 8GB *Storage: **1TB 7200RPM SATA II **160GB SSD *WiFi: 802.11 a/b/g/n =M75e= The ThinkCentre M75e desktop was praised by SlashGear for its processing power and small form factor. In terms of design, the desktop was similar to other ThinkCentre products from Lenovo, with no unnecessary styling and designs. Components could be accessed by removing two screws on the chassis. The desktop contained an AMD Athlon II X4 640 processor, 4GB of DDR3 RAM, a 500GB hard disk drive, and ATI Radeon HD 3000 discrete graphics. The desktop was indicated by Lenovo to be \\"multi- monitor friendly\\", with the capacity to power two displays even with the basic configuration. An optional half-height graphics card also allowed two additional monitors to be powered, for a total of four independent displays. The primary points of criticism were a direct result of the desktop's small form factor. Although the space for cooling was reduced, the M75e did not exceed stable temperatures. However, noise was a concern. The PC's fan would only run for a short duration at a high speed, making it louder than some desktops and workstations. Detailed specifications of the ThinkCentre M75e desktop are as follows: *Processor: up to AMD Phenom II X4 B9x series *Operating system: Microsoft Windows 7 (Professional /Home Premium/Home Basic) *Chipset: AMD 750G + SB710 *Storage: up to 500GB 7200RPM hard disk drive *RAM: up to 16GB DDR3 *Graphics: **ATI Radeon 3000 (integrated) **NVIDIA Quadro FX380 **NVIDIA GeForce 310 **NVIDIA GeForce 310 =M77= Announced on October 28, 2011, the ThinkCentre M77 could be upgraded to include AMD's FX processors and up to 16GB of RAM. According to Tom Shell, the vice-president and general manager of Lenovo's Commercial Desktop Business Unit, this represented a level of processing power previously found only in premium desktops. The desktop was made available in both tower and small form factors. According to Lenovo, the use of Enhanced Experience 3.0 allowed the desktop to boot in less than 30 seconds. The desktop optionally included AMD Radeon discrete graphics, with support for up to four independent displays. Additional features on the desktop included a hard disk drive of up to 1TB, eight USB 2.0 ports, a 25-in-1 memory card reader, Trusted Platform Module, and hard disk encryption. 2012 =M82= The M82 is available in Tower or SFF. Specifications: *Standard: (Tower) **Processor: 2nd Generation Intel Core i3-2120 (3.3 GHz) **Operating System: Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) **RAM: 4GB DDR3 Memory **Storage: 1x500GB 7200RPM SATA **Graphics: Integrated Graphics *Customized with best options: (Tower) **Processor: Up to 3rd generation Intel Core i7-3770 (3.4 GHz Clock, 3.9 Turbo) **Operating system: Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) **RAM: Up to 8GB DDR3 Memory **Storage: Up to 2x1TB 7200RPM SATA (Tower) **Graphics: Up to AMD Radeon HD 7450 2013 =M92/M92p= The M92p is a desktop computer designed for business use. Like other computers of the M series, it exists in three form factors: tower, small form factor (SFF) and tiny. The M92p uses Intel Core i3, i5 or i7 processors and makes use of DDR3-1600 RAM. Graphics processing is done by an integrated Intel HD Graphics 2000 GPU. The M92p is available with both hard drives and solid-state storage. One difference with the M91p is that the M92p comes with four USB 3.0 ports on the rear of the computer, whilst the M91p only offers USB 2.0 ports. In a review for ZDNet, Charles McLellan wrote, \\"Unless internal expansion is required, we can find little wrong with Lenovo's ThinkCentre M92p as a business-class small-form-factor PC (and there are bigger models in the range if expansion is required).

The page also has photos of the place.  Name origin  Jinjiang - and most of the central Jiangsu region - is situated on the Yangtze River's alluvial plain. The terrain here is generally very flat. A small isolated hill, located some 6 km north of the Yangtze, is the only hill within a large area; for this reason the hill has become a well-known topographic feature in the region, received its name, \\"Lonely Hill\\" (Gushan). Thousands of years ago, before the Yangtze Delta we know today had formed, the Lonely Hill was a small island in the Yangtze estuary, and the only piece of dry land within the boundaries of today's Jingjiang county-level city. It is thought that it was not until 1488 that it became fully surrounded by land. The Buddhist temple on top of the hill (Gushan Si, \\"The Lonely Hill Temple\\") and the adjacent town (Gushan Town) received their names from the hill.  Description  It looks like a sitting lion, with the height of 53 meters and the total area is 5.8 hectares. And it covers an area of 50000 square meters. The Lonely Hill is covered with old trees, flowers and bushes, so it looks all green. It is said that Lonely Hill was developed 1800 years ago.http://www.tznews.cn/Article/pzk/pcm/200706/487.html The Gushan Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery is located on the hills western slope; it occupies 107 mu (about 18 acres). According to a recent count, 1522 persons are buried there, including 1 participant of peasant wars, 336 participants of the war against Japan, 998 participants of the Chinese Civil War, 106 participants of the Korean War, and 81 persons who perished during the socialist construction.ÈùñÊ±üÁÉàÂ£´ÈôµÂõ≠ (Gushan Martyrs' Cemetery)  Customs  Smart people built a temple at the top of the hill so the hill has become a religious land now. Every year on 3 March, there is a temple fair in Lonely Hill, attracting many people to take part in it. It is very small but that‚Äôs its feature so it will not take you a lot of time to climb it and you should not worry that you‚Äôll feel tired. You can take your time to enjoy its beauty.

He was awarded Righteous among the Nations, by the memorial site Yad Vashem. He was raised in Gottschee, a German linguistic enclave in Slovenia, as the son of a German-speaking teacher and a Galizian aristocracy originated mother, whom he later described as a ‚Äúnationality aware Pole‚Äù. In 1919 the family moved to Salzburg, where, after the flight from Gottschee, which was now part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, his father found work in teacher education in Salzburg. After finishing school in 1925 Petsche studied in Vienna. From 1929 on he worked as a teacher, at first in Salzburg, from 1931 to 1933 in Ried im Innkreis and from 1933 on in St. P√∂lten. In 1944 Petsche was an officer of the Wehrmacht in the city of Novi Sad where he was accommodated by the Jewish family Csarneyi. The Jewish attorney Dr. Tibor, his wife Vera and their five-year-old twin daughters also lived in the same house. On 25 March 1944, 4,000 Jews were supposed to be deported to Auschwitz concentration camp. Petsche decided to save the two underage daughters of Dr. Tibor and traveled with the children and a housemaid to Budapest to an aunt of the children. Petsche passed the housemaid as his wife and the children as his own. That very same night Petsche traveled back to Novi Sad to help Dr. Tibor and his family members to get train tickets, so they could leave Novi Sad. The ill grandmother of the Tibors stayed back in Novi Sad. Petsche took her to a hospital and took care for her until she died. Nevertheless, Vera Tibor, her daughters and their aunt were arrested and deported to Auschwitz. The aunt and the children survived and settled down in Israel after the war. After World War II, Petsche worked in Linz as a teaching instructor from 1945 to 1950, then from 1950 on for the school supervisory board, and among other things as inspector for art education for several states. He retired in 1972 and moved back to Ried im Innkreis. Besides his career he kept active as a painter, although he never offered his paintings on the art market. He preferred figurative motives, which, with age, he almost exclusively created in a headstrong collage technique made out of colourful chalk drawings and light prints, that he called Lumigraphie. Museums in Ried and Graz, amongst others, still show his art. By 1983 Petsche, who was by then court counsellor (Hofrat), was awarded Righteous among the Nations by the Israeli memorial site Yad Vashem for the rescue of the Tibor family. As reasons for his actions Petsche stated ‚Äúthe self-evident human command, to help others in need‚Äù. He was also aware of his mother‚Äôs family destiny, who lost several family members in a concentration camp. In 2002 at the 11th Braunauer Zeitgeschichte-Tage his paintings were shown in combination with the theme civil courage and resistance to dictatorships in Kultur im Gugg.

WSUD is a term used in the Middle East and Australia and is similar to low-impact development (LID), a term used in the United States; and Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS), a term used in the United Kingdom. Background Traditional urban and industrial development alters landscapes from permeable vegetated surfaces to a series of impervious interconnected surfaces resulting in large quantities of stormwater runoff, requiring management. Historically Australia, like other industrialised countries including the United States and United Kingdom, has treated stormwater runoff as a liability and nuisance endangering human health and property. This resulted in a strong focus on the design of stormwater management systems that rapidly convey stormwater runoff directly to streams with little or no focus on ecosystem preservation.Roy, AH, Wenger, SJ, Fletcher, TD, Walsh, CJ, Ladson, AR, Shuster, WD, Thurston, HW & Brown, RR 2008, 'Impediments and solutions to sustainable, watershed-scale urban stormwater management: Lessons from Australia and the United States', Environmental Management, vol. 42, pp. 344‚Äì359. This management approach results in what is referred to as urban stream syndrome.Walsh, CJ, Roy, AH, Feminella, JW, Cottingham, PD, Groffman, PM & Morgan, RP 2005, 'The Urban Stream Syndrome : Current knowledge and the search for a cure, Journal by The North American Benthological Society, vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 706‚Äì723. Heavy rainfall flows rapidly into streams carrying pollutants and sediments washed off from impervious surfaces, resulting in streams carrying elevated concentrations of pollutants, nutrients and suspended solids. Increased peak flow also alters channel morphology and stability, further proliferating sedimentation and drastically reducing biotic richness. Increased recognition of urban stream syndrome in the 1960s resulted in some movement towards holistic stormwater management in Australia. Awareness increased greatly during the 1990s with the Federal government and scientists cooperating through the Cooperative Research Centre program.Brown, R & Clarke, J 2007 The transition towards water sensitive urban design: the story of Melbourne, Australia, Report No. 07/01, Facility for Advancing Water Biofiltration, Monash University, Clayton, VIC. Increasingly city planners have recognised the need for an integrated management approach to potable, waste and stormwater management,Donofrio, J, Kuhn, Y, McWalter, K, & Winsor, M. 2009, 'Water Sensitive Urban Design: An emerging model in sustainable design and comprehensive water cycle management', Environmental Practice, vol. 11, no. 3, pp. 179‚Äì189. to enable cities to adapt and become resilient to the pressure which population growth, urban densification and climate change places on ageing and increasingly expensive water infrastructure. Additionally, Australia's arid conditions means it is particularly vulnerable to climate change, which together with its reliance on surface water sources, combined with one of the most severe droughts (from 2000‚Äì2010) since European settlement, highlight the fact that major urban centres face increasing water shortages. This has begun shifting the perception of stormwater runoff from strictly a liability and nuisance to that of having value as a water resource resulting in changing stormwater management practices. Australian states, building on the Federal government's foundational research in the 1990s, began releasing WSUD guidelines with Western Australia first releasing guidelines in 1994. Victoria released guidelines on the best practice environmental management of urban stormwater in 1999 (developed in consultation with New South Wales) and similar documents were released by Queensland through Brisbane City Council in 1999. Cooperation between Federal, State and Territory governments to increase the efficiency of Australia's water use resulted in the National Water Initiative (NWI) signed in June 2004. The NWI is a comprehensive national strategy to improve water management across the country, it encompasses a wide range of water management issues and encourages the adoption of best practice approaches to the management of water in Australia, which include WSUD.Council of Australian Governments, 2009, Intergovernmental agreement on a national water initiative, Council of Australian Governments, Canberra, viewed 18 September 2011, <>. Differences to conventional urban stormwater management WSUD regards urban stormwater runoff as a resource rather than a nuisance or liability. This represents a paradigm shift in the way environmental resources and water infrastructure are dealt with in the planning and design of towns and cities. WSUD principles regard all streams of water as a resource with diverse impacts on biodiversity, water, land, and the community's recreational and aesthetic enjoyment of waterways. Principles * Protecting and enhancing creeks, rivers and wetlands within urban environments; * Protecting and improving the water quality of water draining from urban environments into creeks, rivers and wetlands; * Restoring the urban water balance by maximising the reuse of stormwater, recycled water, and grey water; * Conserving water resources through reuse and system efficiency; * Integrating stormwater treatment into the landscape so that it offers multiple beneficial uses such as water quality treatment, wildlife habitat, recreation and open public space; * Reducing peak flows and runoff from the urban environment simultaneously providing for infiltration and groundwater recharge; * Integrating water into the landscape to enhance urban design as well as social, visual, cultural and ecological values; and * Easy and cost effective implementation of WSUD allowing for widespread application. Objectives * Reducing potable water demand through demand and supply side water management; * Incorporating the use of water efficient appliances and fittings; * Adopting a fit-for-purpose approach to the use of potential alternative sources of water such as rainwater; * Minimising wastewater generation and the treatment of wastewater to a standard suitable for effluent reuse and/or release to receiving waters; * Treating stormwater to meet water quality objectives for reuse and/or discharge by capturing sediments, pollutants, and nutrients through the retention and slow release of stormwater; * Improving waterway health through restoring or preserving the natural hydrological regime of catchments through treatment and reuse technologies; * Improving the aesthetics and the connection with water for urban dwellers; * Promoting a significant degree of water-related self- sufficiency within urban settings by optimizing the use of water sources to minimise potable, storm, and waste water inflows and outflows through the incorporation into urban design of localised water storage; * Counteracting the 'urban heat island effect' through the use of water and vegetation, assisting in replenishing groundwater. Techniques * The use of water- efficient appliances to reduce potable water use; * Greywater reuse as an alternate source of water to conserve potable supplies; * Detention, rather than rapid conveyance, of stormwater; * Reuse, storage and infiltration of stormwater, instead of drainage system augmentation; * Use of vegetation for stormwater filtering purposes; * Water efficient landscaping to reduce potable water consumption; * Protection of water-related environmental, recreational, and cultural values by minimising the ecological footprint of a project associated with providing supply, wastewater, and stormwater services; * Localised wastewater treatment, and reuse systems to reduce potable water consumption, and minimise environmentally harmful wastewater discharges; * Provision of stormwater or other recycled urban waters (in all cases subject to appropriate controls) to provide environmental water requirements for modified watercourses; * Flexible institutional arrangements to cope with increased uncertainty and variability in climate; * A focus on longer term planning; and * A diverse portfolio of water sources, supported by both centralised and decentralised water infrastructure. Common WSUD practices Common WSUD practices used in Australia are discussed below. Usually, a combination of these elements are used to meet urban water cycle management objectives. =Road layout and streetscape= Bioretention systems Bioretention systems involve the treatment of water by vegetation prior to filtration of sediment and other solids through prescribed media. Vegetation provides biological uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus and other soluble or fine particulate contaminants. Bioretention systems offer a smaller footprint than other similar measures (e.g. constructed wetlands) and are commonly used to filter and treat runoff prior to it reaching street drains. Use on larger scales can be complicated and hence other devices may be more appropriate. Biorentention systems comprise bioretention swales (also referred to as grassed swales and drainage channels) and bioretention basins. =Bioretention swales= Bioretention swales, similar to buffer strips and swales, are placed within the base of a swale that is generally located in the median strip of divided roads. They provide both stormwater treatment and are. A bioretention system can be installed in part of a swale, or along the full length of a swale, depending on treatment requirements. The runoff water usually goes through a fine media filter and proceeds downwards where it is collected via a perforated pipe leading to downstream waterways or storages. Vegetation growing in the filter media can prevent erosion and, unlike infiltration systems, bioretention swales are suited for a wide range of soil conditions. =Bioretention basins= Parking lot that drains to a small bioretention basin. Bioretention basins provide similar flow control and water quality treatment functions to bioretention swales but do not have a conveyance function. In addition to the filtration and biological uptake functions of bioretention systems, basins also provide extended detention of stormwater to maximise runoff treatment during small to medium flow events. The term raingarden is also used to describe such systems but usually refers to smaller, individual lot-scale bioretention basins. Bioretention basins have the advantage of being applicable at a range of scales and shapes and therefore have flexibility in their location within developments. Like other bioretention systems, they are often located along streets at regular intervals to treat runoff prior to entry into the drainage system. Alternatively, larger basins can provide treatment for larger areas, such as at the outfalls of a drainage system. A wide range of vegetation can be used within a bioretention basin, allowing them to be well integrated into the surrounding landscape design. Vegetation species that tolerate periodic inundation should be selected. Bioretention basins are however, sensitive to any materials that may clog the filter media. Basins are often used in conjunction with gross pollutant traps (GPTs or litter traps, include widely used trash racks), and coarser sediment basins, which capture litter and other gross solids to reduce the potential for damage to the vegetation or filter media surface. Infiltration trenches and systems Infiltration trenches are shallow excavated structures filled with permeable materials such as gravel or rock to create an underground reservoir.WSUD Engineering Procedures: Stormwater 2008, CSIRO Publishing, Melbourne. They are designed to hold stormwater runoff within a subsurface trench and gradually release it into the surrounding soil and groundwater systems. Although they are generally not designed as a treatment measure but can provide some level of treatment by retaining pollutants and sediments. Runoff volumes and peak discharges from impervious areas are reduced by capturing and infiltrating flows. Due to their primary function of being the discharge of treated stormwater, infiltration systems are generally positioned as the final element in a WSUD system. Infiltration trenches should not be located on steep slopes or unstable areas. A layer of geotextile fabric is often used to line the trench in order to prevent the soil from migrating into the rock or gravel fill. Infiltration systems are dependent on the local soil characteristics and are generally best suited to soils with good infiltrative capacity, such as sandy-loam soils, with deep groundwater. In areas of low permeability soils, such as clay, a perforated pipe may be placed within the gravel. Regular maintenance is crucial to ensure that the system does not clog with sediments and that the desired infiltration rate is maintained. This includes checking and maintaining the pre-treatment by periodic inspections and cleaning of clogged material. Sand Filters Sand filters are a variation of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with weep holes between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming. Porous paving Porous paving (or pervious paving) is an alternative to conventional impermeable pavement and allows infiltration of runoff water to the soil or to a dedicated water storage reservoir below itFletcher, TD, Duncan, HP, Poelsma, P & Lloyd, S 2003, Stormwater flow and quality and the effectiveness of non-proprietary stormwater treatment measures: A review and gap analysis, The Institute for Sustainable Water Resources, Monash University and the CRC for Catchment Hydrology, Victoria. In reasonably flat areas such as car parks, driveways and lightly used roads, it decreases the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff and can improve water quality by removing contaminants through filtering, interception and biological treatment. Porous pavements can have several forms and are either monolithic or modular. Monolithic structures consist of a single continuous porous medium such as porous concrete or porous pavement (asphalt) while modular structures include porous pavers individual paving blocks that are constructed so that there is a gap in between each paver. Commercial products that are available are for example, pavements made from special asphalt or concrete containing minimal materials, concrete grid pavements, and concrete ceramic or plastic modular pavements. Porous pavements are usually laid on a very porous material (sand or gravel), underlain by a layer of geotextile material. Maintenance activities vary depending on the type of porous pavement. Generally, inspections and removal of sediment and debris should be undertaken. Modulate pavers can also be lifted, backwashed and replaced when blockages occurs. Generally porous pavement is not suited for areas with heavy traffic loads.Jayasuriya, LNN, Kadurupokune, N, Othman, M & Jesse, K 2007, 'Contributing to the sustainable use of stormwater: the role of pervious pavements', Water Science and Technology, vol. 56, no. 12, pp. 69‚Äì75. Particulates in stormwater can clog pores in the material. =Public open space= Sedimentation basins Sediment basin installed on a construction site. Sedimentation basins (otherwise known as sediment basins) are used to remove (by settling) coarse to medium-sized sediments and to regulate water flows and are often the first element in a WSUD treatment system. They operate through temporary stormwater retention and reduction of flow velocities to promote settling of sediments out of the water column. They are important as a pretreatment to ensure downstream elements are not overloaded or smothered with coarse sediments. Sedimentation basins can take various forms and can be used as permanent systems integrated into an urban design or temporary measures to control sediment discharge during construction activities. They are often designed as an inlet pond to a bioretention basin or constructed wetland. Sedimentation basins are generally most effective at removing coarser sediments (125 Œºm and larger) and are typically designed to remove 70 to 90% of such sediments. They can be designed to drain during periods without rainfall and then fill during runoff events or to have a permanent pool. In flow events greater than their designed discharge, a secondary spillway directs water to a bypass channel or conveyance system, preventing the resuspension of sediments previously trapped in the basin. Constructed wetlands Constructed wetlands are designed to remove stormwater pollutants associated with fine to colloidal particles and dissolved contaminants. These shallow, extensively vegetated water bodies use enhanced sedimentation, fine filtration and biological uptake to remove these pollutants. They usually comprise three zones: an inlet zone (sedimentation basin) to remove coarse sediments; a macrophyte zone, a heavily vegetated area to remove fine particulates and uptake of soluble pollutants; and a high flow bypass channel to protect the macrophyte zone. The macrophyte zone generally includes a marsh zone as well as an open water zone and has an extended depth of 0.25 to 0.5m with specialist plant species and a retention time of 48 to 72 hours. Constructed Wetlands can also provide a flow control function by rising during rainfall and then slowly releasing the stored flows.Melbourne Water 2010 Constructed wetlands guidelines, Melbourne Water, Melbourne. Constructed wetlands will improve the runoff water quality depending on the wetland processes. The key treatment mechanism of wetlands are physical (trapping suspended solids and adsorbed pollutants), biological and chemical uptake (trapping dissolved pollutants, chemical adsorption of pollutants), and pollutant transformation (more stable sediment fixation, microbial processes, UV disinfection). The design of constructed wetlands requires careful consideration to avoid common problems such as accumulation of litter, oil and scum in sections of the wetland, infestation of weeds, mosquito problems or algal blooms. Constructed wetlands can require a large amount of land area and are unsuitable for steep terrain. High costs of the area and of vegetation establishment can be deterrents to the use of constructed wetlands as a WSUD measure. Guidelines for developers (such as the Urban Stormwater: Best Practice Environmental Management Guidelines in VictoriaVictorian Stormwater Committee 1999, Urban stormwater: best practice environmental management guidelines, CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, VIC, viewed 19 September 2011.) require the design to retain particles of 125Œºm and smaller with very high efficiency and to reduce typical pollutants (such as phosphorus and nitrogen) by at least 45%. In addition to stormwater treatment, the design criteria for constructed wetlands also include enhanced aesthetic and recreational values, and habitat provision. The maintenance of constructed wetlands usually includes the removal of sediments and litter from the inlet zone, as well as weed control and occasional macrophyte harvesting to maintain a vigorous vegetation cover. Swales and buffer strips Two swales for a housing development. The foreground one is under construction while the background one is established. Swales and buffer strips are used to convey stormwater in lieu of pipes and provide a buffer strip between receiving waters (e.g. creek or wetland) and impervious areas of a catchment. Overland flows and mild slopes slowly convey water downstream and promote an even distribution of flow. Buffer areas provide treatment through sedimentation and interaction with vegetation. Swales can be incorporated in urban designs along streets or parklands and add to the aesthetic character of an area. Typical swales are created with longitudinal slopes between 1% and 4% in order to maintain flow capacity without creating high velocities, potential erosion of the bioretention or swale surface and safety hazard. In steeper areas check banks along swales or dense vegetation can help to distribute flows evenly across swales and slow velocities. Milder-sloped swales may have issues with water- logging and stagnant ponding, in which case underdrains can be employed to alleviate problems. If the swale is to be vegetated, vegetation must be capable of withstanding design flows and be of sufficient density to provide good filtration). Ideally, vegetation height should be above treatment flow water levels. If runoff enters directly into a swale, perpendicular to the main flow direction, the edge of the swale acts as a buffer and provides pre- treatment for the water entering the swale. Ponds and lakes Ponds and Lakes are artificial bodies of open water that are usually created by constructing a dam wall with a weir outlet structure. Similar to constructed wetlands, they can be used to treat runoff by providing extended detention and allowing sedimentation, absorption of nutrients and UV disinfection to occur. In addition, they provide an aesthetic quality for recreation, wildlife habitat, and valuable storage of water that can potentially be reused for e.g. irrigation.Mackay City Council 2008 Engineering design guidelines: Constructed lakes, Planning Scheme Policy No. 15.15, Mackay City Council, Mackay, QLD. Often, artificial ponds and lakes also form part of a flood detention system. Aquatic vegetation plays an important role for the water quality in artificial lakes and ponds in respect of maintaining and regulating the oxygen and nutrient levels. Due to a water depth greater than 1.5m, emergent macrophytes are usually restricted to the margins but submergent plants may occur in the open water zone. Fringing vegetation can be useful in reducing bank erosion. Ponds are normally not used as stand-alone WSUD measure but are often combined with sediment basins or constructed wetlands as pretreatments. In many cases however, lakes and ponds have been designed as aesthetic features but suffer from poor health which can be caused by lack of appropriate inflows sustaining lake water levels, poor water quality of inflows and high organic carbon loads, infrequent flushing of the lake (too long residence time), and/or inappropriate mixing (stratification) leading to low levels of dissolved oxygen. Bluegreen algae caused by poor water quality and high nutrient levels can be a major threat to the health of lakes. To ensure the long-term sustainability of lakes and ponds, key issues that should be considered in their design include catchment hydrology and water level, and layout of the pond/lake (oriented to dominant winds to facilitate mixing. Hydraulic structures (inlet and outlet zones) should be designed to ensure adequate pre- treatment and prevent large nutrient ‚Äòspikes' Landscape design, using appropriate plant species and planting density are also necessary. High costs of the planned pond/lake area and of vegetation establishment as well as frequent maintenance requirements can be deterrents to use of ponds and lakes as WSUD measures. The maintenance of pond and lake systems is important to minimise the risk of poor health. The inlet zone usually requires weed, plant, debris and litter removal with occasional replanting. In some cases, an artificial turn over of the lake might be necessary. =Water re-use= Rainwater tanks Rainwater tanks are designed to conserve potable water by harvesting rain and stormwater to partially meet domestic water demands (e.g. during drought periods). In addition, rainwater tanks can reduce stormwater runoff volumes and stormwater pollutants from reaching downstream waterways. They can be used effectively in domestic households as a potential WSUD element.Khastagir, A & Jayasuriya, LNN 2010, 'Impacts of using rainwater tanks on stormwater harvesting and runoff quality', Water Science and Technology, vol. 62, pp. 324‚Äì329. Rain and stormwater from rooftops of buildings can be collected and accessed specifically for purposes such as toilet flushing, laundry, garden watering and car washing. Buffer Tanks allow rain water collected from hard surfaces to seep into the site helps maintain the aquifer and ground water levels. In Australia, there are no quantitative performance targets for rainwater tanks, such as size of tank or targeted reductions in potable water demand, in policies or guidelines. The various guidelines provided by state governments however, do advise that rain water tanks be designed to provide a reliable source of water to supplement mains water supply, and maintain appropriate water quality. The use of rainwater tanks should consider issues such as supply and demand, water quality, stormwater benefits (volume is reduced), cost, available space, maintenance, size, shape and material of the tank. Rainwater tanks must also be installed in accordance with plumbing and drainage standards.Standards Australia 2003. AS/NZS 3500.3: Plumbing and drainage ‚Äì Stormwater drainage, Standards Australia, Sydney. An advised suitable configuration may include a water filter or first flush diversion, a mains water top-up supply (dual supply system), maintenance drain, a pump (pressure system), and an on-site retention provision. Potential water quality issues include atmospheric pollution, bird and possum droppings, insects e.g. mosquitoe larvae, roofing material, paints and detergents. As part of maintenance, an annual flush out (to remove built up sludge and debris) and regular visual inspections should be carried out.Abbott, SE, Douwes, J & Caughley, BP 2006, 'A survey of the microbiological quality of roof-collected rainwater of private dwellings in New Zealand', New Zealand Journal of Environmental Health, vol. 29, pp. 6‚Äì16. Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) (also referred to as Managed Aquifer Recharge) aims to enhance water recharge to underground aquifers through gravity feed or pumping. It can be an alternative to large surface storages with water being pumped up again from below the surface in dry periods. Potential water sources for an ASR system can be stormwater or treated wastewater. The following components can usually be found in an ASR system that harvests stormwater:Environmental Protection Agency (South Australia) 2004, Code of Practice for Aquifer Storage and Recovery, Adelaide, viewed 19 September 2011 <>. # A diversion structure for a stream or drain; # A treatment system for storm water prior to injection as well as for recovered water; # A wetland, detention pond, dam or tank, as a temporary storage measure; # A spill or overflow structure; # A well for the water injection and a well for the recovery of the water, and # Systems (including sampling ports) to monitor water levels and water quality. The possible aquifer types suitable for an ASR system include fractured unconfined rock and confined sand and gravel. Detailed geological investigations are necessary to establish the feasibility of an ASR scheme. The potential low cost of ASR compared to subsurface storage can be attractive. The design process should consider the protection of groundwater quality, and recovered water quality for its intended use. Aquifers and aquitards need also be protected from damaged by depletion or high pressures. Impacts of the harvesting point on downstream areas also require consideration. Careful planning is required regarding aquifer selection, treatment, injection, the recovery process, and maintenance and monitoring. Policy, planning and legislation In Australia, due to the constitutional division of power between the Australian Commonwealth and the States, there is no national legislative requirement for urban water cycle management. The National Water Initiative (NWI), agreed upon by Federal, State and Territory governments in 2004 and 2006, provides a national plan to improve water management across the country. It provides clear intent to ‚ÄúCreate Water Sensitive Australian Cities‚Äù and encourages adoption of WSUD approaches. National guidelines have also been released in accordance with NWI clause 92(ii) to provide guidance on evaluation of WSUD initiatives. At the state level, planning and environmental legislation broadly promotes ecologically sustainable development, but to varying degrees have only limited requirements for WSUD. State planning policies variously provide more specific standards for adoption of WSUD practices in particular circumstances. At the local government level, regional water resource management strategies supported by regional and/or local catchment-scale integrated water cycle management plans and/or stormwater management plans provide the strategic context for WSUD.NMcAuley, A, McManus, R & Knights, D 2009, Water sensitive urban design: implementation framework for Darwin discussion paper, Northern Territory Government, Sydney, viewed 18 September 2011, <>. Local government environment plans may place regulatory requirements on developments to implement WSUD. As regulatory authority over stormwater runoff is shared between Australian states and local government areas, issues of multiple governing jurisdictions have resulted in inconsistent implementation of WSUD policies and practices and fragmented management of larger watersheds. For example, in Melbourne, jurisdictional authority for watersheds of greater than 60 ha rests with the state-level authority, Melbourne Water; while local governments govern smaller watersheds. Consequently, Melbourne Water has been deterred from investing significantly in WSUD works to improve small watersheds, despite them affecting the condition of the larger watersheds into which they drain and waterway health including headwater streams. =State legislation and policy= Victoria In Victoria, elements of WSUD are integrated into many of the overall objectives and strategies of the Victorian planning policy.['Victoria Planning Provisions] cs. 14.02-1, 14.02‚Äì3, 19.03‚Äì2, 19.03‚Äì3 The State Planning Policy Framework of the [Victoria Planning Provisions] which is contained in all planning schemes in Victoria contains some specific clauses requiring adoption of WSUD practices. New residential developments are subject to a permeability standard that at least 20 per cent of sites should not be covered by impervious surfaces. The objective of this is to reduce the impact of increased stormwater run-off on the drainage system and facilitate on-site storm-water infiltration. New residential subdivisions of two or more lots are required to meet integrated water management objectives related to: * drinking water supply;Victoria Planning Provisions c. 56.07-1 * reused and recycled water;Victoria Planning Provisions c. 56.07-2 * waste water management,Victoria Planning Provisions c. 56.07-3 and * urban run-off management.Victoria Planning Provisions c. 56.07-4 Specifically regarding urban run-off management, the Victoria Planning Provisions c. 56.07-4 Clause 25 states that stormwater systems must meet best practice stormwater management objectives. Currently, whilst no longer considered best practice, the state standard is Urban Stormwater: Best Practice Environmental Management Guidelines.Victoria Planning Provisions c. 56.07 The current water quality objectives, which do not protect waterways from the impacts of stormwater are: * 80 per cent retention of typical urban annual suspended solids load; * 45 per cent retention of typical urban annual total phosphorus load; * 45 per cent retention of typical urban annual total nitrogen load; and * 70 per cent reduction of typical urban annual litter load. Urban stormwater management systems must also meet the requirements of the relevant drainage authority. This is usually the local council.State of Victoria, Department of Sustainability and Environment 2006, Using the integrated water management provisions of Clause 56 ‚Äì Residential subdivision, State of Victoria, Department of Sustainability and Environment, Mulgrave, VIC, viewed 19 September 2011, . However, in the Melbourne region, where a catchment greater than 60ha is concerned it is Melbourne Water. Inflows downstream of the subdivision site are also restricted to pre-development levels unless approved by the relevant drainage authority and there are no detrimental downstream impacts. Melbourne Water provides a simplified online software tool, STORM (Stormwater Treatment Objective ‚Äì Relative Measure), to allow users to assess if development proposals meet legislated best practice stormwater quality performance objectives. The STORM tool is limited to assessment of discrete WSUD treatment practices and so does not model where several treatment practices are used in series.Melbourne Water, n.d., About STORM, viewed 19 September 2011, . Of It is also limited to sites where coverage of impervious surfaces is greater than 40%. For larger more complicated developments more sophisticated modelling, such as MUSIC software, is recommended. New South Wales At the state level in New South Wales, the is the primary piece of policy mandating adoption of WSUD. BASIX is an online program that allows users to enter data relating to a residential development, such as location, size, building materials etc.; to receive scores against water and energy use reduction targets. Water targets range from a 0 to 40% reduction in consumption of mains-supplied potable water, depending on location of the residential development.BASIX 2006, BASIX: about the BASIX indices, viewed 19 September 2011, <>. Ninety per cent of new homes are covered by the 40% water target. The BASIX program allows for the modelling of some WSUD elements such as use of rainwater tanks, stormwater tanks and greywater recycling. Local Councils are responsible for the development of Local Environment Plans (LEPs) which can control development and mandate adoption of WSUD practices and targets . Due to a lack of consistent policy and direction at the state-level however, adoption by local councils is mixed with some developing their own WSUD objectives in their local environmental plans (LEP) and others having no such provisions.McManus, R & Morison, P 2007, Barriers and opportunities to WSUD adoption in the Botany Bay catchment, viewed 19 September 2011, . In 2006 the then NSW Department of Environment and Conservation released a guidance document, Managing Urban Stormwater: Harvesting and Reuse. The document presented an overview of stormwater harvesting and provided guidance on planning and design aspects of integrated landscape-scale strategy as well as technical WSUD practice implementation.Department of Environment and Conservation NSW 2006, Managing urban stormwater: Harvesting and reuse, Department of Environment and Conservation NSW 2006, Sydney, viewed 19 September 2011, . The document now however, although still available on the governmental website, does not appear to be widely promoted. The Sydney Metropolitan Catchment Management Authority also provides tools and resources to support local council adoption of WSUD.Sydney Metropolitan Catchment Management Authority 2010, Tools & resources, viewed 19 September 2011, . These include * Potential WSUD provisions for incorporation into Local Government LEPs, with State-level department approval in NSW; * Potential WSUD clauses for incorporation into Local Government reports, tenders, expressions of interest or other materials.; * A WSUD Decision Support Tool to guide councils in comparing and evaluating on-ground WSUD projects, and * Draft guidelines for the use of the more sophisticated MUSIC modelling software in NSW Predictive modelling to assess WSUD performance Simplified modelling programs are provided by some jurisdictions to assess implementation of WSUD practices in compliance with local regulations. STORM is provided by Melbourne Water and BASIX is used in NSW, Australia for residential developments. For large, more complicated developments, more sophisticated modelling software may be necessary.BMT WBM 2010, Draft NSW MUSIC modelling guidelines, Sydney, viewed 17 September 2011, <>. Issues affecting decision-making in WSUD =Impediments to the adoption of WSUD= Major issues affecting the adoption of WSUD include: * Regulatory framework barriers and institutional fragmentation at state and local government levels; * Assessment and costing uncertainties relating to selecting and optimising WSUD practices for quantity and quality control; * Technology and design and complexity integrating into landscape-scale water management systems; and * Marketing and acceptance and related uncertainties. The transition of Melbourne city to WSUD over the last four decades has culminated in a list of best practice qualitiesBrown, R & Clarke, J 2007, The transition towards water sensitive urban design: the story of Melbourne, Australia, Report No. 07/01, Facility for Advancing Water Biofiltration, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, p. 44. and enabling factors,Brown, R & Clarke, J 2007, The transition towards water sensitive urban design: the story of Melbourne, Australia, Report No. 07/01, Facility for Advancing Water Biofiltration, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, p. 47. which have been identified as important in aiding decision making to facilitate transition to WSUD technologies. The implementation of WSUD can be enabled through the effective interplay between the two variables discussed below.Brown, R & Clarke, J 2007, The transition towards water sensitive urban design: the story of Melbourne, Australia, Report No. 07/01, Facility for Advancing Water Biofiltration, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, p.

WSUD projects in Australia WSUD technologies can be implemented in a range of projects, from previously pristine and undeveloped, or Greenfield sites, to developed or polluted Brownfield sites that require alteration or remediation. In Australia, WSUD technologies have been implemented in a broad range of projects, including from small-scale road-side projects, up to large-scale +100 hectare residential development sites. The three key case studies below represent a range of WSUD projects from around Australia. =A raingarden biofilter for small-scale stormwater management= Ku-ring-gai Council‚Äôs Kooloona Crescent Raingarden, NSW The WSUD Roadway Retrofit Bioretention System is a small-scale project implemented by the Ku-ring-gai Council in NSW as part of an overall catchment incentive to reduce stormwater pollution. The Raingarden uses a bioretention system to capture and treat an estimated 75 kg of total suspended solids (TSS) per year of local stormwater runoff from the road, and filters it through a sand filter media before releasing it back into the stormwater system. Permeable pavers are also used in the system within the surrounding pedestrian footpaths, to support the infiltration of runoff into the ground water system.WSUD in Sydney 2010, WSUD roadway retrofits, viewed 19 September 2011, <>. Roadside bioretention systems similar to this project have been implemented throughout Australia. Similar projects are presented on the Sydney Catchment Management Authority's WSUD website: * 2005 Ku-ring-gai Council ‚Äì Minnamurra Avenue Water Sensitive Road Retrofit Project; * 2003 City of Yarra, Victoria ‚Äì Roadway reconstruction with inclusion of bioretention basins to treat stormwater; * 2003-4 City of Kingston, Victoria (Chelsea) ‚Äì Roadway reconstruction with inclusion of bioretention basins to treat stormwater, and * 2004 City of Kingston, Victoria (Mentone) ‚Äì Roadway reconstruction with inclusion of bioretention basins to treat stormwater. =WSUD in residential development projects= Lynbrook Estate, Victoria The Lynbrook Estate development project in Victoria, demonstrates effective implementation of WSUD by the private sector. It is a Greenfield residential development site that has focused its marketing for potential residents on innovative use of stormwater management technologies, following a pilot study by Melbourne Water.Melbourne Water n.d., Lynbrook Estate viewed 20 September 2011, . The project combines conventional drainage systems with WSUD measures at the streetscape and sub-catchment level, with the aim of attenuating and treating stormwater flows to protect receiving waters within the development. Primary treatment of the stormwater is carried out by grass swales and an underground gravel trench system, which collects, infiltrates and conveys road/roof runoff . The main boulevard acts as a bioretention system with an underground gravel filled trench to allow for infiltration and conveyance of stormwater. The catchment runoff then undergoes secondary treatment through a wetland system before discharge into an ornamental lake. This project is significant as the first residential WSUD development of this scale in Australia. Its performance in exceeding the Urban Stormwater Best Practice Management Guidelines for Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus and Total Suspended Solids levels, has won it both the 2000 President's Award in the Urban Development Institute of Australia Awards for Excellence (recognising innovation in urban development), and the 2001 Cooperative Research Centres' Association Technology Transfer Award. Its success as a private-sector implemented WSUD system led to its proponent Urban and Regional Land Corporation (URLC) to look to incorporate WSUD as a standard practice across the State of Victoria. The project has also attracted attention from developers, councils, waterway management agencies and environmental policy- makers throughout the country. =Large-scale remediation for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games= Homebush Bay, NSW For the establishment of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games site, the Brownfield area of Homebush Bay was remediated from an area of landfill, abattoirs and a navy armament depots into a multiuse Olympic site. A Water Reclamation and Management Scheme (WRAMS) was set up in 2000 for large-scale recycling of non-potable water, which included a range of WSUD technologies. These technologies were implemented with a particular focus on addressing the objectives of protecting receiving waters from stormwater and wastewater discharges; minimising potable water demand; and protecting and enhancing habitat for threatened species 2006.Cooperative Research Council for Catchment Hydrology 2000, Water sensitive urban design in the Australian context: Synthesis of a conference held 30‚Äì31 August 2000, Melbourne, Australia Cooperative Research Council for Catchment Hydrology, Melbourne, viewed 19 September 2011,. The focus of WSUD technologies was directed towards the on-site treatment, storage and recycling of stormwater and wastewater. Stormwater runoff is treated using gross pollutant traps, swales and/or wetland systems. This has contributed to a reduction of 90% in nutrient loads in the Haslams Creek wetland remediation area. Wastewater is treated in a water reclamation plant. Almost 100% of sewage is treated and recycled.Sydney Olympic Park Authority 2011, Water & cachments, Sydney Olympic Park Authority, viewed 20 September 2011, . The treated water from both stormwater and wastewater sources is stored and recycled for use throughout the Olympic site in water features, irrigation, toilet flushing and fire fighting capacities. Through the use of WSUD technology, the WRAMS scheme has resulted in the conservation of 850 million litres (ML) of water annually, a potential 50% reduction in annual potable water consumption within the Olympic site, as well as the annual diversion of approximately 550 ML of sewage normally discharged through ocean outfalls. As part of the long-term sustainability focus of the 'Sydney Olympic Park Master Plan 2030', the Sydney Olympic Park Authority (SOPA) has identified key best practice environmental sustainability approaches to include, the connection to recycled water and effective water demand management practices, maintenance and extension of recycled water systems to new streets as required, and maintenance and extension of the existing stormwater system that recycles water, promotes infiltration to sub soil, filters pollutants and sediments, and minimises loads on adjoining waterways.Sydney Olympic Park Authority 2011, Sydney Olympic Park Master Plan 2030, Sydney Olympic Park Authority, viewed 20 September 2011, . The SOPA has used WSUD technology to ensure that the town remains 'nationally and internationally recognised for excellence and innovation in urban design, building design and sustainability, both in the present and for future generations.

The field has a potential for mining of power grade coal, much of which can be extracted through open cast mining. Gare block has been identified for captive mining by private companies. According to the Geological Survey of India total reserves (including proved, indicated and inferred reserves) of non-coking coal in the Mand Raigarh Coalfield is 18,532.93 million tonnes. Out of this 13,868.20 million tonnes is up to depth of 300 metres, 4569.51 million tonnes is at a depth of 300-600 meres and 95.22 million tonnes is at a depth of 600‚Äì1200 m.

The Mand Raigarh Coalfield does not have a rail link (as of 2012). Construction of the long Bhupdeopur-Korichhapar/Baroud- Dharamjaygarh with an extension up to the Champa-Korba branch line is essential for the transportation of around 100 million tonnes of coal planned annually from Mand Raigarh Coalfield.

There was 1 hide of land and land for 4 ploughs. There were 12 serfs, 10 acres of woodland, 2 cattle and 30 sheep. The value of the manor was 3 shillings though it had formerly been worth ¬£1 sterling.Thorn, C. et al., ed. (1979) Cornwall.

It is the remains of a small round enclosure (called a round) of a type that dates back to sometime between the latter part of the Iron Age and post-Roman Britain. The round at Callestock Veor appears to be of a circular hut and is in a reasonable condition compared to other examples of these sites. It was probably the dwelling of a pre- historic farmer and other examples of such sites nearby have dated back to the Bronze Age with the earliest such examples at around 1,700BC. Just to the north of the A30 road and at around south-west of Callestick is a bowl barrow which is a scheduled ancient monument. A bowl barrow is a funerary monument that was built sometime in the Late Neolithic period to the Late Bronze Age (generally to the period 2400-1500 BC). The bowl barrow at Callestick Vean is a low mound, approximately high and with a diameter of around . This bowl barrow is unusual in that it is on relatively low-lying ground; normally bowl barrows are constructed in a more prominent position, such as a hill top. A little further to the west, a further pair of bowl barrows lie close together and are also listed monument. About to the south-east of Callestick is the West Weal Chiverton mine. It was mainly a lead mine producing over 45,000 tons of high grade lead and over one million ounces of silver between 1859 and 1886.

Accessed 4 February 2014 \\"Nessie\\" 'Nessie', campaigned by Arthur Moloney and Roger Nicholls at a World Endurance Championship event at Donington Park in 1981, showing the enclosed belt-drive to the remote-mounted alternator relocated from the end of the crankshaft to the rear of the engine, as on their early Laverda racer Laverda Nessie, from a 'For Sale' classified advertisement in a 1982 copy of Motor Cycle News Mead & Tomkinson then came to fame in the mid-1970s with their specially designed endurance racer, nicknamed 'Nessie', (after the Loch Ness Monster because the bike was not a thing of beauty). The engines were conventional roadster engines, tuned for racing power. First they used a 1,000 cc Laverda Jota triple, and later a 1,000 cc Kawasaki four. Feeling that racing bike design was too conservative, the Tomkinsons gave Nessie a number of innovations: * Whereas motorcycles conventionally have the (light) exhaust pipes below the engine and the (heavy) fuel tank above, Nessie reversed this order to lower the centre of gravity. An inverted triangle in cross-section, the fuel tank was underslung beneath the engine. * Whilst most bikes have telescopic forks, Nessie used an adapted version of Difazio hub-center steering, whereby braking forces were directed to the frame via a pivoted fork (rather than through the steering head). This allowed neutral steering and an absence of brake dive. * The rear suspension was a parallelogram arrangement, to provide stiffness without weight. This device was not entirely successful, possibly because of having so many rose- joint linkages, and the team reverted to a conventional swingarm. * The rear suspension pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the drive sprocket to maintain constant chain tension. This feature meant that (i) a smaller drive chain could be used and (ii) the chain was less stressed and therefore less likely to break. * Nessie had its ignition circuitry in a removable, quickly-detachable 'cassette', so that if it proved faulty, it could be unplugged and replaced with ease. Thirty-five years later, some of these special features have been adopted by mainstream road and racing bikes, such as the ELF,http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/features/122_0801_elf_racing_motorcycle_chassis_design/viewall.htmlhttp://www.themotart- journal.com/2011/10/elf-motorcycle-racing.html but Nessie remains unique in having them all on a single machine.

The desktop included an Intel Core 2 Duo T6600 processor, 4GB of DDR3 memory, a 500GB hard disk drive, Intel GMA X4500 integrated HD graphics. The desktop was described by PCMag as being appropriate for digital entertainment requirements (like movies and audio) but not 3D games. The desktop did not include an optical drive, or a remote for the Media Center and TV features. The IdeaCentre A310 was awarded four of five stars by PCMag. =A310= Released in November 2010, the IdeaCentre A310 desktop represented an update to the A300. The chassis was the same as the A300, with a slim screen and components contained in the base. To compensate for the lack of a built-in optical drive, an external optical drive was included with the desktop. However, the external optical drive did not support reading/writing Blu-ray discs. Also, unlike the A300, a remote was included for the ATSC/HDTV tuner. The IR receiver was not built into the AIO, however, and required a USB dongle to function correctly. 2009 The IdeaCentre A Series desktop released in 2009 was the A600. =A600= The first desktop in Lenovo‚Äôs IdeaCentre A Series was the A600. It was an all-in- one (AIO). Engadget indicated that the launch was expected in late March or early April 2009, since the AIOs were made available for orders on Lenovo‚Äôs Web site on March 25, 2009. However, the actual launch occurred in May 2009. Engadget reported that different reviewers agreed on the fact that the desktop offered good value for its price. Two features indicated to be especially good value were the TV tuner and the remote that could be used as a controller and a VoIP handset. In its review of the A600 desktop, PCMag indicated that the desktop was better than large screen notebooks, offering a 16:9 21.5 inch widescreen, with a maximum resolution of 1920x1080. The chassis thickness varied between 1 inch and 2.4 inches ‚Äì the thickest area was below the screen, which contained the system components.

It is home to a disused china clay mine. Geography The hamlet lies to the west of St Austell in Cornwall, immediately to the south (and adjacent to) Foxhole and a short distance to the north of the village of High Street. It is in the civil parish of St Stephen-in-Brannel. The area consisted primarily of a few disparate farms until around 1900 when flurry of house-building saw Carpalla and neighbouring Foxhole take shape, mainly taking the form of a linear settlement with very few amenities. Industry Carpalla's largest and most dominant feature is a disused china clay mine, around which the hamlet and the neighbouring village of Foxhole developed. Up until the mid-19th century farming had been the main industry in the area, the 1841 United Kingdom census showed that the vast majority of residents were engaged in agricultural work, however by the time the 1851 census was carried out the clay industry had slightly overtaken farming as the biggest employer. The China clay mine and engine house There was also a long history of tin mining in the area, but this had come to an end by the 1850s. Towards the end of the 19th century many of the local smallholdings had merged to form larger farms, with the result that even fewer of the local households were engaged in agricultural work and clay mining had now become the dominant form of employment in the area. The area was one of the first areas of Cownwall to be exploited for its China clay deposits, but all mining activities came to an end in 2008. The mine itself is now flooded but the engine house, unusually with its roof still intact, is still standing. The Harvey & Co. 40-inch pumping engine that it housed dated from 1863, but was only used on this site between 1913 until 1944, having been moved here from St Agnes shortly before the First World War. The Science Museum purchased the engine in 1952, removed it from the site, and put it into storage where as of 2020 it still remains.

Cold Northcott wind farm is operated by a three-man crew of engineers who perform routine maintenance on the wind turbines. The turbines are manufactured by WEG. In early 2016 the current 22, twin-bladed, wind turbines were out of use due to health and safety regulations. After being out of use for nearly six months, from June 2016, 20 turbines returned to use. Two turbines are still currently out of use due to one being struck by lightning. The other turbine, that is out of use, had a faulty gearbox. This then caused the blades to blow off during a storm, this then resulted in the whole wind farm closing for nearly six months due to health and safety regulations. During the six months the crew of engineers carried out maintenance on the current operational turbines.

Ajax is historically one of the most successful clubs in the world; according to the IFFHS, Ajax were the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century. The club is one of the five teams that has earned the right to keep the European Cup and to wear a multiple-winner badge; they won consecutively in 1971‚Äì1973. In 1972, they completed the continental treble by winning the Eredivisie, KNVB Cup, and the European Cup. Ajax's last international trophies were the 1995 Intercontinental Cup and the 1995 Champions League, where they defeated Milan in the final; they lost the 1996 Champions League final on penalties to Juventus.

They previously played at De Meer Stadion and the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium (for international matches).  Amateur era  Ajax v Sparta Rotterdam in 1912 The club was founded in Amsterdam on 18 March 1900 by Floris Stempel, Carel Reeser and Han Dade, the second incarnation after a short-lived previous attempt‚Äîas Football Club Ajax‚Äîin 1894.\\"Ajax ‚Äì 1893‚Äì1900: De pre-historie\\" . AFC Ajax. Retrieved on 2009-06-14 The club was named after the mythological hero Ajax, a Greek who fought in the Trojan War against Troy. In The Iliad, Ajax was said to be the greatest of all the Greeks next to his cousin Achilles, and even fought an inconclusive duel with Troy's champion, Hector. According to most accounts, Ajax died by committing suicide, thus, unlike Achilles, he died unconquered. Ajax succeeded in promotion to the highest level of Dutch football in 1911 under the guidance of Jack Kirwan, their first official coach. The promotion meant that Ajax were forced to alter the club's strip, as Sparta of Rotterdam had the same kit, red-white vertical stripes with black shorts. Ajax adopted a broad vertical red stripe on a white background with white shorts, which remains the club's kit colours to this day. Although their efforts were not unnoticed (G√© Fortgens became a frequent member of the Dutch national team for many years), they were relegated in 1914. While they immediately bounced back, they had to wait until 1917 to regain higher level status again: they did become league champions in both 1915 and 1916, however the 1915 league was declared unofficial (due to World War I), whereas in 1916 they did not make it through the promotion round. Under the guidance of Jack Reynolds (Kirwan's successor as of 1915), the club was promoted to the highest level in 1917 and won the Dutch national cup final, defeating VSV 5‚Äì0. Ajax went on to win their first national championship in 1918. The championship was secured in Tilburg where they faced Willem II without Jan de Natris, arguably the club's first star player, who missed the train to Tilburg and opted to stay in Amsterdam instead, earning him a fine of ten cents. In the following season, he received a six-month ban, though Ajax nonetheless performed well in his absence; not only did they retain the championship title, their 1919 campaign was also an unbeaten run for them, an accomplishment that was only repeated 76 years later by Ajax themselves. 'De Meer' stadium in 1934 Now a regular contender for the Western Regional championship in the Netherlands, Ajax marched through the 1920s with regional titles in 1921, 1927 and 1928, in addition to a few minor cup victories. The 1930s would prove to be more successful, however; with household names as Wim Anderiesen Sr., Dolf van Kol, Piet Strijbosch, Wim Volkers, Jan van Diepenbeek, Bob ten Have, Erwin van Wijngaarden and prolific striker Piet van Reenen, Ajax' period from the late '20s until World War II was so successful that many people dubbed it \\"the golden age\\" (a reference to the 17th century, the heyday of the Dutch Republic). With eight regional titles (1930‚Äì32, 1934‚Äì37 and 1939) and five national championships (1931, 1932, 1934, 1937 and 1939), Ajax was the most successful team of that era in the country. The 1930s were also notable for the final culmination of the rivalry with Feyenoord, another squad that earned many awards in that time, as well as the creation of the stadium 'het Ajax-Stadion' dubbed 'De Meer' (named after the borough of its residence). Until the emergence of the Amsterdam Arena in 1996, this was Ajax' home ground together with the Olympic Stadium for higher-profile games. An Ajax team of 1947 As of the 1940s, perhaps in line with Jack Reynolds' retirement (he had stayed ‚Äì save for a few spells of absence ‚Äì on for the entire time as Ajax' manager since his entry in 1915), Ajax went through a period of rebuilding. Gerrit Fischer and Erwin van Wijngaarden were retained, with Joop Stoffelen, Guus Dr√§ger, G√© van Dijk, Jan Potharst and later Rinus Michels and Cor van der Hart brought in. After a Cup Final victory in 1943, Ajax went on to finish second in the championship league in 1946 (behind HFC Haarlem) followed by a league championship win in 1947. They became regional champions in 1950 again, though they never came near winning the championship. The season was notable for a match against SC Heerenveen, with Heerenveen coming back from 5‚Äì1 down to win 6‚Äì5. In 1941, Ajax performed the opposite: after being 6‚Äì0 behind to VUC in The Hague they managed to pull out a draw in the end (6‚Äì6). Until 1954, the year that professional football was introduced in the Netherlands, Ajax had some minor successes, with the regional title in 1952 and a second place in the regional championship in 1954 (equal in points with fellow Amsterdam club DWS).  Professional football and the road to the top  In 1955, professional football was finally permitted in the Netherlands. Ajax was still far from the international top, as was demonstrated in the European Cup match against Vasas SC, where they were beaten by the Hungarians 4‚Äì0 in the N√©pstadion. Similar European failures followed in 1960, with Ajax being knocked out by the Norwegian amateurs of Fredrikstad FK and in the Cup Winners' Cup in 1961 by √öjpest of Ferenc Bene. Ajax achieved some success on the domestic level, earning the first Eredivisie-championship in 1957 and again in 1960, the 1960 title decided by a playoff after equalling in points with arch-rivals Feyenoord. Ajax cruised to a 5‚Äì1 victory with a hat trick by striker Wim Bleijenberg. Johan Cruyff played at Ajax between 1959‚Äì73 and 1981‚Äì83, winning 3 European Cups; his #14 is the only squad number Ajax has ever retired. Cruyff came back to manage the club from 1985‚Äì88. Bleijenberg was not the top scorer, however. Henk Groot ‚Äì the younger brother of Cees Groot, who had scored 100 goals for Ajax in his five-year stay ‚Äì arrived in 1959 from Stormvogels and scored 38 goals in 1959‚Äì60 and 41 in 1960‚Äì61. He was a vital part of Ajax in the early 1960s, replacing star striker Piet van der Kuil, who had left for PSV in 1960. Alongside the man who would later become Mister Ajax, Sjaak Swart, Co Prins, Ton Pronk, Bennie Muller and a young Piet Keizer, Ajax added the National Cup in 1961 and the Intertoto Cup 1962 to their trophy cabinet. After missing out on the championship after a 5‚Äì2 defeat against PSV in 1963, Ajax entered a period of decline in the national league. Henk Groot left to Feyenoord that summer, and in 1964‚Äì65, they were near relegation. Things improved after former player Rinus Michels replaced Vic Buckingham as the head manager. Ajax managed to secure a midtable spot under Michels; however, Buckingham's second tenure saw the introduction of Johan Cruyff during a 3‚Äì1 loss at GVAV. Michels started a revolution in Amsterdam, beginning with the return of Henk Groot and Co Prins, as well as the signing of goalkeeper Gert Bals. Michels built a side around the vision of \\"Total Football,\\" sacrificing players who he considered not to be good enough or fit the style of play. The most notable example of this was defender Frits Soetekouw ‚Äì replaced by Ajax' new captain Velibor Vasoviƒá ‚Äì whose own goal aided the victory of Dukla Prague in the quarter-final of the European Cup in 1966‚Äì67, after Ajax had knocked out Be≈üikta≈ü and defeated Liverpool 5‚Äì1 at the Mistwedstrijd. Ajax sealed their second consecutive championship in 1967. They were not as dominant as the previous year, but with a seemingly unstoppable attack, they scored no less than 122 goals (still a national record), of which 33 were from Johan Cruyff, who, at just 20 years of age, was already the team's star player. It was also the season for another important milestone‚Äîfor the first time in history, Ajax won the double (after defeating NAC Breda in the cup final). It earned them European Cup qualification, being knocked out by Real Madrid in the subsequent season, with Veloso scoring the winner for Los Merengues in extra time after two 1‚Äì1 draws, results which greatly enhanced the reputation of the club. Ajax won the Dutch title of 1968 overtaking Feyenoord, the league leaders for much of the season, and reached the European Cup final of 1969 in Madrid against Milan. In qualifying for the European Cup Final, Ajax defeated 1. FC N√ºrnberg in the first round. They were almost knocked out by Benfica in the second, losing 1‚Äì3 to them in Amsterdam but winning the second leg in Lisbon, 1‚Äì3. The decisive third match in neutral Paris was won 3‚Äì0 through two goals by Inge Danielsson and one by Cruyff. They repeated this score at home against the next opponent, Czechoslovak club Spartak Trnava, in the next round, but struggled in the second leg, narrowly qualifying on aggregate. In the final, Milan, lauded for their excellent defence and counter-attacks, easily won 4‚Äì1, with Pierino Prati opening the scoring after seven minutes and going on to score a hat-trick, while Velibor Vasoviƒá was the only Ajax player on the scoresheet after scoring from a penalty. Milan's win was capped by a goal by Angelo Sormani.  Gloria Ajax: European dominance and treble  Three of the most notable figures of the Totaalvoetbal school: Johan Neeskens, Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff Following their loss in the European Cup Final, Ajax entered another period of rebuilding. Among the new additions were national top scorer Dick van Dijk and midfielders Gerrie M√ºhren and Nico Rijnders, while a second team player, Ruud Krol, was promoted to the first XI. They replaced Klaas Nuninga, Inge Danielsson, Theo van Duijvenbode (all sold to other clubs) and Henk Groot, who retired from football after an injury while playing against Poland. Ton Pronk and Bennie Muller were no longer as frequently in the first 11 after many years of service. In 1969‚Äì70, Ajax won the Dutch league championship, winning 27 out of 34 games and scoring 100 goals. Feyenoord remained in contention throughout the season, but they had to settle for second place. Both clubs won a trophy, however, with Ajax winning the Eredivisie title while Feyenoord captured the European Cup. Ajax reached the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970 (being knocked out by Arsenal after defeating Hannover 96, Napoli, Ruch Chorz√≥w and Carl Zeiss Jena). 1970‚Äì71 European Cup Final. The year 1971 became the long-awaited year of glory, with Ajax winning trophies at both domestic and European level. For a substantial part of the season, Ajax seemed to be on their way to the European treble (a feat only previously performed by Celtic in 1967). Domestically, Ajax finished second to Feyenoord in the league, winning the KNVB Cup after a replayed final against Sparta Rotterdam. In Europe, Ajax defeated 17 N√´ntori, FC Basel, Celtic and Atl√©tico Madrid en route to the 1971 European Cup Final played at Wembley Stadium on June 2. There, 83,000 spectators witnessed a 2‚Äì0 victory over Panathinaikos, with goals from Dick van Dijk and an Arie Haan shot deflected by defender Kapsis. Captain Velibor Vasoviƒá could finally lift the European Cup after having lost two previous finals in 1966 with FK Partizan and again in 1969. In the following years, Ajax established itself as the foremost club in European football. Romanian coach Stefan Kovacs replaced Michels in 1971, while Rijnders and Vasoviƒá departed in the same year; Van Dijk departed in 1972. Such changes in the side and management did not disrupt the success of the club, however, with Ajax completing the treble of European Cup, Dutch National Championship and the KNVB Cup in 1972 to which was added the Intercontinental Cup. In 1973, Ajax won a third consecutive European Cup and another Dutch championship; however, failure in the KNVB Cup meant Ajax missed out on a second consecutive treble. The departure of Johan Cruyff for Barcelona in 1973 signalled the end of the period of success, effectively ending the reign of the so-called \\"12 Apostles,\\" the typical starting XI of Heinz Stuy, Wim Suurbier, Barry Hulshoff, Horst Blankenburg, Ruud Krol, Arie Haan, Johan Neeskens, Gerrie M√ºhren, Sjaak Swart, Johan Cruyff and Piet Keizer, plus the usual 12th man, usually Ruud Suurendonk until 1972, then Johnny Rep. Whereas clubs like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Internazionale, Arsenal, Juventus and Independiente were beaten by Ajax between 1971 and 1973, failure in the European Cup at the hands of CSKA Sofia in late 1973 signalled the decline of Ajax in European football. Nevertheless, the \\"Total Football\\" that they had propagated became a lasting memory for many football fans, contributing to the Dutch national team reaching the final of the 1974 FIFA World Cup using similar tactics. The decline of Ajax and the loss to the West Germans in the World Cup Final saw the end of the Total Football era. Years later, Ajax manager Tomislav Iviƒá would dub the era Gloria Ajax, illustrating the impact of the team's years at the pinnacle of European football.  First renaissance and 1980s  Van Basten, Cruyff and Rijkaard in 1986. After a period of decline, in 1977, Tomislav Iviƒá coached Ajax to their first domestic championship since 1973. Ajax returned to domestic success winning five league championships after 1977, as well as four cups, though impressive European performances were sparse. Ajax were knocked out by Juventus in the quarter- finals of the European Cup in 1978 and reached a European Cup semi-final in 1980, losing to eventual winners Nottingham Forest. Disappointing European form between 1980 and 1986 saw the club failing to progress past the second round for six-straight years. Johan Cruyff returned to the club in 1981, with the club producing some talented youngsters in the mid-1980s, such as Wim Kieft, John van 't Schip, Marco van Basten, Gerald Vanenburg, Jesper Olsen and Frank Rijkaard. Ajax parade the Cup Winners' Cup in 1987. After leaving the club in 1983 after a conflict with President Harmsen, Cruyff returned once again in 1985 as the team's new manager. His attacking tactics were immediately illustrated in his first active season, where Ajax ended the season with 120 goals in total, of which 37 were from Ajax's new star player, Marco van Basten. Despite this, Ajax finished as runners-up in the league to PSV twice in a row in 1985‚Äì86 and 1986‚Äì87. Despite the lack of domestic league success, however, Cruyff's Ajax won the 1987 Cup Winners' Cup, beating East German club Lokomotive Leipzig. Ajax then reached the Final again in the following season, losing out to KV Mechelen. Cruyff departed prior to the second Cup Winners' Cup Final largely as a result of the declining results on the domestic front. With most of the 1980s' stars such as Van Basten also leaving, Ajax once again declined. They continued to compete for the title with PSV in subsequent years, who became the dominant club in European and Dutch football, matching Ajax's 1972 achievement of a continental treble in 1988. Negative aspects of the period 1988 from 1991 were the fraud-case in 1989 and a year-long ban from European competition in 1990‚Äì91 following an incident whereby a fan threw an iron bar at the Austria Wien goalkeeper during a UEFA Cup tie in the 1989‚Äì90 season. Under new manager Leo Beenhakker, Ajax went on to win the championship race with PSV in 1990, almost also winning the league again in 1991, but narrowly losing-out to PSV.  Van Gaal era: European success and decline  Spitz Kohn and assistant Louis van Gaal in 1988. On departure to Real Madrid in 1991, Beenhakker was replaced by Louis van Gaal, the team's former assistant coach. Like Cruyff, Van Gaal rapidly made his mark by altering Ajax' tactics, and also like Cruyff, his efforts were rewarded in his first season at the helm by winning the 1992 UEFA Cup after a thrilling final against Torino. Although he did not play the Final's second leg, the tournament saw the arrival of Dennis Bergkamp, who contributed six goals during the competition. Despite Bergkamp being the top goalscorer in Dutch football in 1991 and 1992, Ajax once again finished as runners-up to PSV in the league. In 1992‚Äì93, Ajax even had to settle for a third spot for first time since 1984, though they nonetheless won the KNVB Cup. In 1993, Bergkamp and Wim Jonk left to Internazionale, allowing Finn Jari Litmanen to establish himself as the new number 10 for Ajax. Aside from Litmanen, Ajax attracted Finidi George and the return of Frank Rijkaard, providing a base for Van Gaal to build on. Ajax won three consecutive league titles in 1993‚Äì94, 1994‚Äì95 and 1995‚Äì96. The 1994‚Äì95 season saw Ajax win both the UEFA Champions League and the league title after going unbeaten in both tournaments. It was also the final season for Frank Rijkaard, while striker Patrick Kluivert had an excellent start to his first-team career, with the then 18-year-old coming off the bench to score a late winner to beat Milan 1‚Äì0 in the 1995 Champions League Final. Ajax went on to beat Brazilian side Gr√™mio on penalties to win the 1995 Intercontinental Cup, and beat Real Zaragoza 5‚Äì1 on aggregate to win the 1995 UEFA Super Cup. Ajax also reached the 1996 Champions League Final, losing to Juventus on penalties after a 1‚Äì1 draw. The subsequent period, however, saw the departure of manager Louis van Gaal along with an exodus of many key players, several on free transfers following the Bosman ruling‚ÄîClarence Seedorf departed in 1995; Edgar Davids, Michael Reiziger, Finidi George and Nwankwo Kanu in 1996; Patrick Kluivert, Marc Overmars and Winston Bogarde in 1997, along with Louis van Gaal departing for Barcelona and being replaced by Morten Olsen; Ronald de Boer and Frank de Boer played their last matches for Ajax in 1998 before leaving in January 1999; and Edwin van der Sar and Jari Litmanen also left in 1999, together with the retirement of Frank Rijkaard in 1995 and Danny Blind in 1999. Van Gaal's replacement, Morten Olsen, attracted Danish national team captain Michael Laudrup to the club for the 1997‚Äì98 season. Ajax won the league title and Dutch Cup in 1997‚Äì98. Despite this fine success, however, Olsen could not replace the key players who had departed or maintain the success that there had been under Van Gaal. As Olsen began his second season at the club, tensions arose between Dutch players Ronald and Frank de Boer and the Ajax hierarchy over a contract dispute. Results declined on the pitch as the contract row with the De Boers intensified, and Olsen was ultimately sacked late in 1998. In 1999, Ajax finished sixth in the league, their lowest position in over 20 years, although they did win the 1999 Dutch Cup.  Koeman / Blind / Ten Cate / Van Basten / Jol  In the 2002‚Äì03 season, manager Ronald Koeman led Ajax to the Champions League quarter-finals against Milan, losing only to a last minute winner in the second-leg encounter at the San Siro. Koeman's early success, however, was short-lived. In 2005, he resigned after Ajax's defeat to AJ Auxerre in the UEFA Cup during a period of arguments with football director Louis van Gaal. Danny Blind was Koeman's replacement, and the former instantly caused consternation by announcing that the club was to play using a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation, abandoning the Total Football-oriented 4‚Äì3‚Äì3 that had become Ajax' trademark. The season also saw the departure of key players Rafael van der Vaart and Nigel de Jong to Hamburger SV, and Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá to Juventus, while six others (Hatem Trabelsi, Tom√°≈° Gal√°sek, Hans Vonk, Nourdin Boukhari, Steven Pienaar and Maxwell) revealed they would leave the club at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season. Blind was later sacked on 10 May 2006 after 422 days in charge, where he was replaced by Henk ten Cate, who had won the Champions League and La Liga title in 2006 as the assistant to Frank Rijkaard with Barcelona. Ten Cate gave youngsters Jan Vertonghen and Robbert Schilder a shot at making the team selection, whereas Greek forward Angelos Charisteas was sold to rivals Feyenoord. Ajax missed out on a Champions League place in 2006‚Äì07 after their defeat against FC Copenhagen (3‚Äì2 on aggregate). As a result, Ajax played against IK Start from Norway in the first round of the UEFA Cup on 14 and 18 September, and won the match 9‚Äì2 on aggregate (2‚Äì5 away and 4‚Äì0 home). Having then progressed through the group stages, they drew German club Werder Bremen in the round of 32. In the first leg in Germany, Ajax lost 3‚Äì0. On the return leg in Amsterdam, they rallied for two second half goals to win 3‚Äì1, but lost 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. Ajax players in 2010. In the 2006‚Äì07 season Ajax also achieved some successes with ten Cate in charge. They won the Johan Cruyff Shield after a 3‚Äì1 win over rivals PSV and they also defeated AZ 8‚Äì9 on penalties in the Dutch Cup final after a 1‚Äì1 draw after extra time. Ajax was very close to clinch the Eredivisie title after deducting a ten-point deficit from PSV, but lost it on goal difference on the last matchday to PSV (PSV: 75‚Äì25, Ajax 84‚Äì35). In the following 2007‚Äì08 season, Ajax sold two of the biggest talents: Ryan Babel for ‚Ç¨17 million to Liverpool and Wesley Sneijder for ‚Ç¨27 million to Real Madrid. Luis Su√°rez, seen as a replacement for Babel, was signed from FC Groningen. Ajax decided not to buy a replacement for Sneijder because of the difficulty in finding a similar- position type of player to replace him and also because the deal was finished close to the transfer deadline and Ajax would not rush through any signings. The fact that they did not find any replacement for Sneijder, backed with Edgar Davids's broken leg, disrupted the preparation for the qualification games for a Champions League place. Opponent Slavia Prague won both matches; with a 2‚Äì1 scoreline in Prague and 0‚Äì1 victory in Amsterdam. The failure to clinch a position in the Champions League group stage led to great criticism from both the supporters and the media, mainly directed at Henk ten Cate and the board of directors. A 1‚Äì0 victory over PSV for the Johan Cruyff Shield could not make up for the loss of a Champions League spot. Despite quite a good start in the competition with a lot of goals from both Luis Su√°rez and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Ajax lost ground again in Europe after not making it to the group phase of the UEFA Cup; managing a 0‚Äì1 win away against Dinamo Zagreb but lost the tie in Amsterdam after extra time with the score 2‚Äì3 to Dinamo. With these string of European failures, coach Ten Cate was not able to carry the team through to the Champions League group stage for two seasons in a row and no European football at the ArenA for the remainder of the 2007‚Äì08 season. With these disappointing results, Ten Cate lost the confidence of the supporters, who demanded that the Board sack him. A more viable solution came when Chelsea, in the same week, offered Ten Cate the job of assistant manager on a three-year deal. On 9 October, Ten Cate left Ajax, whereupon Adrie Koster was selected to helm the squad. On 29 October 2007, captain Jaap Stam announced his immediate retirement from professional football due to a lack of motivation to continue. Ajax finished the season second and, following the Play-offs, qualified for the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Cup. Following UEFA Euro 2008, former Ajax striker Marco van Basten was appointed as the new manager, succeeding Koster. Johan Cruyff was poised to take up a new position with the club to overhaul the youth program, but after a dispute with Van Basten, he reneged on this commitment. Following Van Basten's appointement, a host of new players were brought into the squad, including Isma√Øl Aissati and Miralem Sulejmani, whose ‚Ç¨16.25 million transfer from Heerenveen broke the Dutch transfer record. Van Basten chose Klaas-Jan Huntelaar as the new club captain following his appointment, but in the January 2009 transfer window, Huntelaar transferred to Real Madrid on a ‚Ç¨27 million deal, a decision for which Ajax were largely criticised in the Dutch papers. The Volkskrant, for instance, referred to Ajax as a mere \\"trading company\\" that reduced its chances for a title by selling its main striker. Ajax finished third in 2008‚Äì09 season, qualifying for the inaugural UEFA Europa League. Marco van Basten resigned after the penultimate game of the season, citing the season's results and his inability to perform better next season as main reasons. For the last game against Twente, the team was under the hands of assistant coach John van 't Schip. Later in the same month, Martin Jol was signed as the new coach. The 2009‚Äì10 season for Ajax started with two wins, but after an away defeat against rivals PSV and a draw against Sparta Rotterdam, they were again trailing the league leaders in the early stages of the competition. From matchday seven until matchday 27, Ajax held the third place in the league, with Twente and PSV above them, which held the top position respectively 10 and 11 games. Starting with matchday 21, Ajax won every single match until the end of the season. Twente however, unlike PSV, would not succumb to the pressure and eventually succeeded in keeping a one-point deficit to win the title. Ajax finished the season with a goal difference of +86 (106‚Äì20), which was more than double that of Twente (+40). Luis Su√°rez finished the season as top goal scorer with 35 goals, a record for a non-Dutch player in the Eredivisie. Despite the disappointment of missing out on the league title, Ajax would finish the season by winning a record 18th KNVB Cup by defeating Feyenoord in the final. (On their way to this cup triumph, Ajax also re-wrote the Dutch record books with a remarkable 14‚Äì1 victory at the ground of amateurs WHC in Round Four.) The Velvet Revolution At the end of 2010, Cruijff ensured that de Boer became the new trainer after Jol stepped down after too much pressure from Cruijff. Cruijff also ensured that old players came to a part of the board. In early 2011, after too much pressure from Cruijff on the rest of the board, a large part of the rest of the board quit because they did not want to implement Cruijff's plans. Cruijff took a seat on the supervisory board. but Cruijff quarreled with the other four Commissioners. The four Commissioners then tried to work out Cruijff by appointing Louis van Gaal as CEO of Ajax. Cruijff and Van Gaal are long known that they did not like each other. But Cruijff was not known about this and because he is one of the five supervisory directors, that is not correct according to the rules. Cruijff together with his allies start a lawsuit against the other four Commissioners. In early 2012, the judge decided that the appointment was not legal. After that Cruijff had complete freedom to appoint the board he wanted and thus carry out his plan. Edwin van der Sar (now CEO of Ajax) and Marc Overmars (now Football affairs director) have their place on the board because Cruijff wanted this in 2012. Success under De Boer Ajax team lining up for a Champions League match against Lyon in 2011 De Boer's debut game was a 2‚Äì0 win over Milan, which rounded off a largely disappointing performance in a group that included heavyweights Real Madrid and Milan; Ajax picked up only seven points in the group stage and was consigned to play in the UEFA Europa League for the remainder of the season, eventually falling to Russian club Spartak Moscow in the round of 16. On the domestic front, Ajax began turning out some much more positive results in February, losing only once from then on until the end of the season. The team faced Twente twice at the end of the campaign, first in the KNVB Cup Final, then in the final match of the 2010‚Äì11 Eredivisie. In the Cup Final, Ajax had the lead twice but succumbed to a 117th minute Marc Janko goal to lose 3‚Äì2 after extra time. One week later, there was a grandstand finish set up for the Eredivisie. Rivals PSV had lost pace and were sitting in third place, while Ajax sat in second place just one point below Twente. Thus, should Ajax win, they would overtake Twente and claim the league title. Ajax took the lead through Siem de Jong and a Denny Landzaat own goal just after half-time made it 2‚Äì0 to Ajax. Theo Janssen pegged one back for Twente, but it was not to be, as De Jong scored his second and Ajax's third with 12 minutes remaining to put the game to bed. Ajax thus leapfrogged Twente and walked out winners of the 2010‚Äì11 Eredivisie. This was Ajax's 30th championship, earning them their third star. The 2011‚Äì12 season began poorly for Ajax and in one stretch, they lost points in seven out of eight consecutive matches, including draws to PSV, Twente, AZ and Feyenoord in the Klassieker. Ajax was marred by injuries towards the end of 2011, most notably to Nicolai Boilesen and transfer Kolbeinn Sig√æ√≥rsson, who each missed five months or more, as well as Gregory van der Wiel, Siem de Jong and transfer Derk Boerrigter, who each missed a month or more. This led to disappointment in the Champions League, as Ajax failed to progress to the knockout stage by virtue of goal difference. The third-place finish in Group D with Lyon and eventual semi-finalists Real Madrid resulted in qualification to the Europa League knockout stages, where Ajax were drawn against Manchester United. United eliminated Ajax on aggregate, but not before Ajax beat the English powerhouse at Old Trafford 1‚Äì2 on a late goal by Toby Alderweireld. In the Eredivisie, Ajax opened the 2012 calendar year with a draw to then leaders AZ and losses in the Klassieker and to Utrecht. This left Ajax in sixth place, ten points behind leaders AZ. Ajax then proceeded to win their final 14 matches of the season for the second time in three years, winning Ajax their 31st championship. publisher = Soccerway  date = 6 May 2012  accessdate = 7 May 2012 On 5 May 2013, Ajax won their 32nd championship after a 5‚Äì0 home win against Willem II. The team became Amsterdam Sportsteam of the Year of 2013. In 2013‚Äì14, Ajax won their 33rd championship, their fourth consecutive league title for the first time in their long history. Back to European elite (2017‚Äìpresent) In May 2016, Frank de Boer announced that after 6 years and four domestic league titles, he would be leaving the club. Later in the month, it was announced that former Feyenoord technical director and player, Peter Bosz, would take over the side. After initially losing 5‚Äì2 on aggregate to Russian side FC Rostov, Ajax would go on to play in the 2017 UEFA Europa League Final, their first European final in 21 years. They would lose the match 2‚Äì0 to Manchester United, whilst fielding with the youngest side ever in a European final, averaging an age of 22 years and 282 days. For the third consecutive season, they finished runner- up in the Eredivisie, this time to Feyenoord. Bosz would leave for Borussia Dortmund following the conclusion of the 2016‚Äì17 season and was replaced by Marcel Keizer, head coach of Jong Ajax and former Ajax player himself. Keizer was only a week into his tenure when tragedy struck the club and the world of football as a whole. On 8 July 2017, academy starlet Abdelhak Nouri collapsed on the pitch during a pre-season friendly against German side Werder Bremen, due to cardiac arrhythmia. Nouri was transported to a local hospital by helicopter where his condition was announced as stable. Less than a week after his collapse, however, it was revealed that Nouri had suffered severe and permanent brain damage. He would lie in a coma for over a year. Nouri would regain consciousness around August 2018, two months after Ajax admitted that the treatment he received was \\"inadequate\\". An external investigation would reveal that had Ajax's medical team used a defibrillator sooner, Nouri's condition could have been much different. As of September 2019, he is still in a hospital bed but recovering nonetheless. Ajax would fail to qualify for both the Champions League and Europa League group stage in the 2017‚Äì18 season, and Marcel Keizer would be sacked before the turn of the year. On 21 December 2017, it was announced that FC Utrecht manager, Erik ten Hag, would replace Keizer with imminent effect. Ajax would go on to finish runner-up in the 2017‚Äì18 Eredivisie for the fourth consecutive year, falling four points shy of PSV for the title. The 2018‚Äì19 season saw one of Ajax's most successful campaigns of the century. After qualifying for the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Champions League off the back of their second-place finish the previous year and three rounds of qualifying against Sturm Graz, Standard Li√®ge and Dynamo Kyiv respectively, Ajax would compete in the Champions League group stage for the first time since 2014. Ajax ended up finishing the 2018‚Äì19 group stage unbeaten, drawing both fixtures against Bayern Munich and once in Lisbon against Benfica, while winning the home leg against the Portuguese side and both fixtures against AEK Athens. They finished as runner-up in the group stage and qualified for the round of 16, where they faced Real Madrid, who had won the previous three Champions League titles, a feat achieved by Ajax in the 1970s but by no other club in the Champions League era. After losing 1‚Äì2 in the first leg, they would go on to shock Real Madrid by beating them 4‚Äì1 in the Santiago Bernab√©u with an aggregate score of 5‚Äì3 in their favour. Ajax would draw Italian giants Juventus in the Champions League quarter-finals. In the first leg at tge Johan Cruyff Arena, Ajax held Juventus to a 1‚Äì1 draw. In Juventus's stadium, however, Ajax would once again go on the road and beat their opponent in their own stadium, this time by a score of 2‚Äì1 and an aggregate of 3‚Äì2. This meant Ajax qualified for a Champions League semi-final for the first time in over 20 years. Ajax traveled to North London to face English side Tottenham Hotspur, in the first leg of the semi-finals. They won the match 1‚Äì0, marking their ninth straight away match in the competition without a loss. In between legs of the Champions League semi-finals, Ajax would beat Willem II 4‚Äì0 to claim the 2018‚Äì19 KNVB Cup, Ajax's first piece of silverware since the 2013‚Äì14 Eredivisie title. Three days following Ajax's KNVB Cup triumph, the second leg of the Champions League semi-finals took place in Amsterdam. The match started off well for the Dutch side, with 19 year old captain Matthijs de Ligt netting an early goal in the 5th minute, followed by a 35th minute Hakim Ziyech goal to double the home side's advantage and leave them leading 3‚Äì0 on aggregate. The second half of the match was a completely different story, however. Lucas Moura would go on to net a second half hat-trick for the London side, including the winner in the 6th minute of added time. The match would end 3‚Äì2, with Tottenham advancing to the final via the away goals rule with an aggregate score of 3‚Äì3. Despite Ajax's Champions League heartbreak, they would have to kick on and play two more Eredivisie fixtures to claim the shield as they were equal on points with rivals PSV. The first of these two matches included a home match against manager Erik ten Hag's former Utrecht side. Ajax would go on to win the game 4‚Äì1. Immediately after the full-time whistle blew, Ajax match-goers and players alike watched PSV on the Johan Cruyff Arena big screen lose away to fourth-placed AZ, thus putting PSV 3 points behind Ajax with one game remaining and 14 goals behind on goal difference. Ajax cemented their title by defeating De Graafschap, again by a score of 4‚Äì1. This would mark Ajax's 34th domestic league championship, a number that Abdelhak Nouri had previously chose to signify wanting to win Ajax's 34th title.

Anderson, Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999. p.336 ,  Life and work  David Jones was born in Penrhiw, near Neuaddlwyd, Cardiganshire. He studied under Thomas Phillips at the Neuaddlwyd Academy and later at Llanfyllin. At 16, he offered himself for service with the London Missionary Society (LMS) and was sent to Gosport for training, with his friend Thomas Bevan. He was ordained at Neuaddlwyd on 20 and 21 August 1817. He married Louisa Darby of Gosport. Directed by the LMS to serve in Madagascar, Jones and Bevan with their families landed at Tamatave from Mauritius in September 1818. There, he was laid low with malaria, from which his wife and child died. Bevan, his wife and child also died. He gave himself to educational and religious work among the Malagasy population, opening a number of schools. He settled at Antananarivo in 1820. By 1828, there were 37 schools, 44 teachers, and 2,309 students. A \\"Malagasy Schooling Society\\" was established and King Radama 1 took great personal interest in it. In consultation with the king, Jones devised an orthographic system for the Malagasy language. In conjunction with David Griffiths, Jones translated the Bible into Malagasy. With the help of David Johns, he also published a spelling book, a catechism and a hymnary. Following the king‚Äôs death, Christianity in Madagascar was banned in 1835, with some Christians being martyred. Jones returned to Mauritius, which he used as a base for evangelisation. Suffering from malaria, he died there in 1841.

History The earliest mention of Degibna is in 1272 when King Edward I granted land of a Cornish acre at Decuman to William de Treville on the condition he purchase and maintain a boat and fishing hook for the King's use on the Loe whenever he should visit the area. The Ancient Borough of Helston; by H. Spencer Toy. Helston: John Lander & Son, 1912 Degibna has a long Christian history and association with Saint Decuman, with a chapel dedicated to the saint existing since at least the 14th century. The earliest mention of such is on 28 May 1397 when the vicar of Wendron was licensed to celebrate on 27 August each year the Feast of St. Decuman in the Chapel of Decuman in his parish. In addition to this there is a Holy Well that flows along a small white quartz path in an old farm building below Degibna Farmhouse into the Loe, which was subject to regular blessing services by Canon Doble during the early 20th century. \\"Degibna and the Loe Valley\\" by Edward Freeman and Bill Scott, 1986 An ancient Lead and Silver mine, Wheal Pool, was located in the area, operating until the 1880s when it was closed. There was a shaft on the eastern slopes of the valley, some 600 yards N.N.E of Degibna Farm, which was 50 fathoms deep. A drainage adit was constructed in 1790 in the cliffs at the southern end of Loe Pool in order to regulate the lake's water levels to prevent the Mine from drowning. Dines, H. G.

On the coast is Dizzard Point (), and the unique, dwarf oak, Dizzard Wood, which is of international importance for its lichen communities. Geography Dizzard is between the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the valley and cove of Crackington Haven to the west and the Millook woods and valley to the east. There are five named farms or (former farms); Dizzard Farm, East Dizzard, Higher Dizzard, Old Dizzard and West Dizzard. Surrounding Dizzard Point are the stunted oaks of the Dizzard Woodland. There are a number of designations for the Dizzard cliffs, including part of the Widemouth to Crackington Geological Conservation Review site, within the Boscastle to Widemouth SSSI, and the Pentire Point to Widemouth, Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and Heritage Coast. =Access= The Atlantic Highway is two miles to the east and a minor road from Wainhouse Corner to Millook passes through the Dizzard. The minor road is also part of National Cycle Route 3. The South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south-west England from Somerset to Dorset and passes above the wood and along the top of the cliff. Wildlife and ecology A stunted woodland grows on a landslip from the top of the cliff () down to sea-level. Exposure to salt-laden winds has resulted in a tight wind-pruned canopy with trees from 1 to 8 metre high. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is the dominant species with pedunculate oak (Q. robur), birch (Betula spp), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and a few wild-service trees (Sorbus torminalis). Many of the trees are swathed in lichens and moss with 131 species of lichen recorded and there are a number of species that are largely confined to a few north Cornwall and Devon sites. One hundred and twenty flowering plants have been found including, bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), heath pearlwort (Sagina subulata), primrose (Primula vulgaris), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), small bristle club rush (Isolepis setacea), wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca), wood garlic (Allium ursinum) and wood vetch (Vicia sylvatica). Damp areas are dominated by bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa) and the ferns broad buckler fern (Dryopteris dilatata) and royal fern (Osmunda regalis) are abundant. The hay-scented buckler-fern (Dryopteris aemula) is of interest. There was a heronry here in the first decades of the 20th-century. =Lichens= There is a rich Lobaria community including tree lungwort (Lobaria pulmonaria) which grow on the oaks. A number of species are confined to north Cornwall and Devon, these include Bombyliospora pachycarpa, Graphina ruziana, Lecidea carollii, Melaspilea ochrothalamia, Pannaria rubiginosa, Parmeliellia atlantica and Parmeliellia plumbea. Other notable lichens include the blue-grey Stricta limbata and the yellow-orange Pseudocyphellaria crocata.

After fundraising effort and receipt of a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, St. Goran were able to preserve their existing Georgian bells in a traditional wooden frame while installing a refurbished set of 8 Victorian bells from the former church of St. Mary the Virgin in Chatham, Kent. Of the pre-2015 ring of bells, two modern castings were removed - leaving four Pennington bells cast in 1772 in situ. The Taylor 5th bell is now the tenor of the augmentation from three to six at Ab Kettleby, Leicestershire. The Gillett & Johnston 2nd is to become the tenor of a ring of ten bells at Vernet les Bains, France. = Renovations to the Interior = Since 2011, the Church has undergone numerous significant changes to the interior in an attempt to make the church more accessible for its parishioners and more effective as a community space. This began in 2011 with replacing the Lady Chapel's pews with chairs and improving the hand rail. A year later, the Norman font (dating from around 1180) was moved from the back of the church to the Lady Chapel in order to make room for more renovation at the back. In 2014, Fundraising efforts began in earnest to create a community space separate from the main body of the church. Building was completed in 2016 and now includes small and large meeting spaces, a kitchen, a gallery area and course facilities for visiting bell ringers. The new space was opened by the Bishop of Truro (then Tim Thornton) on 9 September 2016.

The station was originally launched in September 1993 on UHF 68 as Australia's first community television station and broadcast intermittently until its final closure in 2012. Unlike other community television stations, LINC TV did not broadcast 24 hours, instead broadcasting on set days throughout the week. History In 1989, Marion Conrow, an arts student at the Southern Cross University in Lismore, then a campus of the, University of New England, came up with the idea to create a community television station in Lismore. The new station, LINC TV, received an 8 month licence for test broadcasting in 1992 and was launched in September 1993 on UHF 68. The station was later granted $260,000 by the university and a permanent broadcasting licence in 1994. LINC TV was closed in early 1999 after losing funding from Southern Cross University. The station recommenced broadcasting in October 2000 after constructing a new tower at Tullera in August that year. The station was off-air from late-January 2001 to mid-November 2001 after their new transmitter, installed in early January, went offline from damage. LINC TV was again taken off-air on 18 August 2003 for extensive upgrades and due to the fact that operating the station required a large amount of time and money. The station began test-pattern broadcasts in July 2004 and recommenced regular transmission in September 2004. In March 2006, LINC TV posted a submission to the Australian Parliament's Inquiry into Community Broadcasting inquiring to the possibility of its broadcasts being carried by a regional television network on digital television in an attempt to keep the station on-air. However, LINC TV never renewed the contract for digital broadcasting or find a regional network that would carry their station, and was finally closed in 2012.

It was later translated into English in 2009 and published by Little, Brown and Company. Plot The Moon Forgets tells the story of what happens when the moon falls from the sky, and is adopted by a little boy, while toy moons are produced. The boy and the moon become close friends with each other, but the toy moons are discarded and nothing goes right, because the world misses its moon. The tides, weather, and astronauts are all affected by the loss of the moon. The boy helps the moon to find its way back to its place in the sky, even if it means that they part. Reception Publishers Weekly found \\"A congruent message doesn't fully materialize, but readers should be entranced by Liao's (The Blue Stone ) fanciful, surreal illustrations.\\" Terry Hong of Book Dragon said \\"As usual, Liao's whistful illustrations are perfect.\\" Installation Art The Moon Bus is an installation art in Xinyi District, Taipei, Taiwan which was based on the book.
