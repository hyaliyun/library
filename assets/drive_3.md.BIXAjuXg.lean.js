His research and conservation efforts have focused on the Galapagos land iguanas, which were in danger of extinction. Biography Snell was born in 1953, in La Mesa, California. He received his BS in Zoology at San Diego State University in 1976. After graduating from San Diego State, he worked in the Galapagos Islands with the Peace Corps (1977 to 1979), and for the Charles Darwin Research Station and the Galapagos National Park from 1977-1980. Subsequently, he earned a Ph.D. in Zoology at Colorado State University, where he was mentored by C. R. Tracy (1979‚Äì1983). He was a post-doctoral associate at Texas Christian University working with Gary Ferguson (1984 to 1985). His first academic position was as an assistant professor at Memphis State University (1985 to 1986), after which he moved to the University of New Mexico (UNM). He is currently a full professor at UNM as well as the curator of amphibians and reptiles at the Museum of Southwestern Biology. Snell is also an active member of The Charles Darwin Foundation. In 1975, he married Heidi Klienschmidt, an artist and photographer. She has a Bachelor of Fine Arts and is also an active member of The Charles Darwin Foundation. Research Snell‚Äôs research broadly examines how human activity and exotic species affect native species. Most of his research has been on lizards, especially land iguanas, in the Gal√°pagos Islands, comparing individual variation and differential phenotypic success to identify components of life history, morphology, and behavior susceptible to human activity. He has expanded this research to include archipelago-wide patterns of co-variation among populations and species. Specific projects include researching co-variation of life-history components among Gal√°pagos organisms (primarily reptiles) and their susceptibility to extirpation and examining correlations between spatial patterns of extinction, distribution of organisms, and human activity. Snell has also conducted extensive research on the efficiency of various restoration strategies for Gal√°pagos vertebrates, and how to control, eradicate, and mitigate introduced species of vertebrates. He has also developed effective methods for ecological monitoring and improving responses by management agencies. Snell has helped philanthropic organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund and government agencies including the Gal√°pagos National Park Service and the Instituto Nacional de Gal√°pagos to make informed decisions about conservation in the Gal√°pagos. h;k][okl'm, /kp'[8 Teaching and advising Snell has been a major advisor for many graduate students.

The operation was a success and resulted in the destruction of the post. Twelve Egyptian soldiers were killed and twenty-nine were taken prisoner. There were two Israeli fatalities. Background On October 26, 1955 Egyptian forces raided a small Israeli outpost at Be'erotayim, located in the southern sector of the Nitzana/El-Auja demilitarized zone. One Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier was killed and two were captured.Ze'ev Drory, Israel's reprisal policy, 1953‚Äì1956: the dynamics of military retaliation, Frank Cass (2005) p. 145 Concurrent with this action, sizable Egyptian forces took control of positions in the southern corner of the Demilitarized Zone near El-Sabcha. Elements of this force also penetrated one kilometer into Israeli territorySefer Hatzanchanim, A. Levin-Epstein (1969), p. 115 and occupied positions near a strategic hill, which the Israelis code-named \\"Lilly\\". The battle Moshe Dayan, Israel‚Äôs Chief of Staff, authorized an immediate retaliation for the Egyptian border transgression but in an entirely different sector. The chosen target was an Egyptian military post near Kuntilla, one- hundred miles south of the Demilitarized Zone.Michael Oren, Origins of the Second Arab-Israeli war, Egypt, Israel and the Great Powers, Frank Cass (1992), p. 32 On the night of October 28‚Äì29, 1955 two-hundred paratroopers commanded by Ariel Sharon attacked the Kuntilla post killing twelve Egyptian soldiers and capturing twenty-nine others. The post was leveled. Two Israeli soldiers, Yaakov Mizrahi and Amnon Abukai, were killed. Both were issued posthumous medals (Mizrahi for \\"Valor\\" and Abukai for \\"Courage\\") for their daring conduct during the assault. Aftermath Israeli commanders pose after Operation Egged.

Each Saturday the newspaper prints a poem chosen by a poet, critic, or other literary figure who also contributes an explanation of the poem and of why they consider it good. Each year the poems and commentaries are collected in book-form, published until 2010 by , and since then by S. Fischer Verlag. In 2013 the 36th volume was published bringing the number of poems in the anthology to almost 2,000. Reich-Ranicki's purpose was to promote German poetry by regularly putting it in front of a wider audience, \\"that part of our readership ‚Äì and be it only a minority ‚Äì which is not yet indifferent to the art of poetry\\". He particularly intended to include a characteristic poem from new volumes by contemporary poets, but thought it essential also to recall poetry from the past. The first poem was by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, with commentary by , the second by Cyrus Atabay, with commentary by Marie Luise Kaschnitz. Introducing the anthology, he gave the project the motto \\"Der Dichtung eine Gasse\\" (literally \\"An alleyway to poetry\\"). Only published poems, from whatever era, would be considered, preferably from a volume currently available in bookshops. The commentaries were to be personal essays accessible to the wider public to inspire them to approach the poem. The only other conditions were dictated by the space available in the newspaper: the poem could not be longer than thirty lines, the commentary not longer than sixty lines in manuscript. To date (2013), works from more than 350 poets have been included, Goethe, Heine and Brecht being amongst the most frequent. But the series has also been a forum for contemporary poets. Commentators have included Erich Fried, Peter H√§rtling, Robert Gernhardt, Wolfgang Koeppen, Golo Mann, Ulla Hahn, Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Siegfried Lenz. In 2011 Reich-Ranicki recalled that editorial colleagues were initially sceptical about the undertaking, expecting only three or four poems to appear before the anthology was quietly buried, but the sales figures show that there is a real market for such a publishing venture; many volumes remain in print, some have even been re-issued. The anthology has become a national institution.

This bipartite division of Southwestern Tai is argued for by Edward Robinson in his paper \\"Features of Proto-N√ºa-Khamti\\" (1994). The following features set off the N√ºa- Khamti group from all the other Southwestern Tai languages. #Labialized velar stops have become velar stops. #Tripartite split of the A tone A1-23-4 #Merger of A23 and B4 #The low vowels /…õ/ and /…î/ have merged with /e/ and /o/, respectively. #* îb > m Luo (2001) Luo Yongxian (2001) also recognizes the uniqueness of Dehong Tai (Tai Nuea), but argues for that it should be placed in a separate Northwestern Tai branch with Southwestern Tai as a sister branch.Luo Yongxian. 2001. The Hypothesis of a New Branch for the Tai Languages. University of Melbourne. Luo claims that the Northwestern Tai branch has many Northern Tai and Central Tai features that are not found in Southwestern Tai. His proposed tree for the Tai branch is as follows. *Tai **Northern **Central **Southwestern **Northwestern Pittayaporn (2009) According to Pittayaporn (2009:301), Southwestern Tai (his subgroup Q) is defined by a phonological shift of *kr- ‚Üí * ∞r-.Pittayaporn, Pittayawat. 2009.

Pittayaporn (2014) also suggests that Southwestern Tai began to disperse southward after the 7th century C.E. but before the 11th century C.E. (between 700 and 1000 C.E., during the late Tang dynasty or early Song dynasty), as evidenced by loanwords from Late Middle Chinese.Pittayaporn, Pittayawat. 2014. \\"Layers of Chinese Loanwords in Proto-Southwestern Tai as Evidence for the Dating of the Spread of Southwestern Tai\\".

The Eastern branch consists of the closely related languages Black Tai, White Tai, and Red Tai, while the Western branch is much more internally diverse.

The reconstructed language is called Proto-Thai; cf. Proto-Tai, which is the ancestor of all of the Tai languages.

It is not clear where they belong in the classification above. Ethnologue also lists under Tai, without further classification, Kuan (Laos), Tai Do (Viet Nam), Tai Pao (Laos), and Tay Khang (Laos). Geographically these would all appear to be Southwestern. Ethnologue also includes T√†y Sa Pa (Sapa) of Vietnam, which Pittayaporn excludes from Southwestern Tai but classifies as the most closely related language outside of that group. Pittayaporn also includes Yoy, which Ethnologue classifies as a Northern Tai language. Further reading *Miyake, Marc. 2014. Is Thai yuan 'Vietnamese' a loanword from Lao? *Miyake, Marc. 2014.

Central Tai languages differ from Northern Tai languages in that Central Tai distinguishes unaspirated and aspirated onsets, while Northern Tai generally does not (Li 1977). Southwestern Tai also displays this kind of aspiration contrast. Classification William Gedney considers Central Tai to be more closely related to Southwestern Tai than to Northern Tai, while Andr√©-Georges Haudricourt argues for a closer relation to Northern Tai. Pittayaporn's (2009) tentative tree of the Tai branch, however, considers Central Tai to be paraphyletic. Certain languages in predominantly Central Tai-speaking areas, such as Caolan and N√πng Anhttp://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/nicolson2000nung.pdf in northern Vietnam, display Northern Tai features as well. These appear to be mixed languages that are not fully Central Tai or Northern Tai. Jerold A. Edmondson calls Caolan a \\"tertium quid.\\"Gregerson, Kenneth J., and Jerold A. Edmondson. 1998.

He was one of 8 children born to Mary and Ray Spratt. He grew up in Minneapolis, MN. Blind from birth Spratt attended St. Cloud State University where he studied communications. In November 1981, Spratt became the first traffic reporter at WCCO-AM radio, as well as the first blind traffic reporter in the country. Spratt worked primarily out of an office in his home that he transformed into a sound booth and filled it with police scanners, telephones, radio equipment, and later computers. Life Spratt was married to Stephanie Borden and they had a son, Benjamin. They divorced in 1987. Spratt later married Carolyn who brought three sons to the family and together they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Lisa. Spratt was a lover of electronics and amateur radio. He held the callsign N0HSR from 1997 until his death in 2007. On satellite communication networks he was known as the SkyScanner. In 2004 Dean lost his position at WCCO due to consolidation and restructuring. His traffic position was outsourced to a company called Metro, who hired Spratt to continue to do the traffic. But, that position was also phased out. He then took up his hobby of amateur radio, propelled by the internet, and joined the W0KIE Satellite Radio Network where he hosted a weekly music/tech/comedy show, Thursday Night Potpourri. It went out over W0KIE as well as streamed on the internet. Death In January 2007 Spratt suffered a stroke. Shortly before entering physical therapy Spratt developed a complication and died on January 20, 2007 surrounded by family. Legacy Shortly after Spratt's death, W0KIE disappeared from the airwaves; but a successor emerged under the new moniker SkyScanner Satellite Radio Network, in Spratt's honor, and remained on air until moving exclusively to the internet in 2011. The network replays Spratt's show, Thursday Night Potpourri, on Monday mornings. The radio serial, Powder River, produced by the Colonial Radio Theatre, and a favorite satellite program, dedicated its fourth season to Spratt, who guest starred in two episodes as Dr. Lyman before he died.

The post, written on August 1, 2010 with obscene words by the Russian user top-lap, who introduced himself as Alexander, criticised the fire safety condition in his native village during the 2010 Russian wildfires and emphasized the disappearance of the village's old fire alarm bell, which top-lap called \\"rynda\\" (a ship's bell in Russian). Top-lap asked to support his appeal, directed to the authorities of Kalyazinsky District in Russia's Tver Oblast. The post was spotted by the Echo of Moscow's editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov on August 1. According to Venediktov, he \\"saw that this message contains not only a money request or criticism of authorities, but a proposal to organize a voluntary fire guard if discounts are offered\\" and \\"it appeared as something new\\" to him. Venediktov forwarded the post with his accompanying commentary on August 2. Putin's reply was e-mailed two days later. The rynda was ultimately installed, although top- lap claimed he was visited by the authorities who took his USB flash drives and hard drive, that reportedly stored nothing but video games. In August, 2010 the question \\"what is rynda\\" became the top query on Yandex search engine, briefly surpassing the query \\"love\\". Putin's rynda also became a subject of political cartoons and is mentioned on the November page of the erotic calendar Happy Birthday, Mr. Putin! Background During the 2010 Russian wildfires local officials were accused of taking inadequate measures to prevent fires and respond effectively. A state of emergency was declared near about 500 towns and villages. The then Russian Minister of Emergency Situations Sergey Shoygu outlined a lack of volunteer firefighting units and poor enforcement of safety rules at dachas. According to him, there were also 24,000 remote villages beyond the reach of fire engines. The United States dispatched an estimated $4.5 million worth of firefighting equipment and other supplies to help battle the wildfires in Russia. While the Russian government called the wildfires a natural disaster that appears every 30 or 40 years, Putin in his reply to top-lap noted that \\"Russia did not experience such high temperatures for the last 140 years\\".

Resolution  Condemning the continuing illicit flow of weapons within and into the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Security Council today renewed until 30 November 2012 the arms embargo and related sanctions on that country, and requested the Secretary-General to extend the mandate of the Group of Experts monitoring those measures. Unanimously adopting resolution 2021 (2011) under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint a sixth expert, on natural resources, and asked the Group of Experts ‚Äî established under resolution 1533 (2004) ‚Äî to report back by 18 May 2012 and again before 19 October 2012. Established in 2003, the sanctions regime consists of an arms embargo against armed groups in the country that are not part of the Government‚Äôs integrated army or police units, as well as a travel ban and an asset freeze on violators of the embargo and other persons and entities designated by the Sanctions Committee for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as determined by relevant Security Council resolutions. Welcoming the support of the due diligence guidelines for importers, processing industries and consumers of Congolese mineral products by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Council called on all States to assist the country and others in the Great Lakes region in the implementation of those guidelines. It encouraged raising awareness of the due diligence guidelines, in particular in the gold sector, as part of a broader effort to mitigate the risk of further financing armed groups and criminal networks within the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC). Also by its resolution, the Council recommended that all States, particularly those in the region, regularly publish full import and export statistics for natural resources, including gold, cassiterite, coltan, wolframite, timber and charcoal, and enhance information sharing and joint action at the regional level to investigate and combat regional criminal networks and armed groups involved in the illegal exploitation of natural resources.

The album marked a major departure from previous recordings. The producer, Ian Brennan, stated that it \\"was the least overdubbed, most live, band-centric and song-oriented record they have done.‚Äù The album won a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album in 2012.  Recording sessions  The album was recorded during a three-week session in the rocky desert near Djanet, a town on the southern rim of the Tassili n'Ajjer plateau located in south-eastern Algeria. It was this protected region from which the group derived the album's name. The plateau served as an alternate location to record the album after Tessalit, the band's home town in northern Mali, proved to be too precarious due to renewed conflict. The region's close proximity to Libya made it a place of relative safe passage for Kel Tamashek fighters who traveled from the refugee camps in Libya to the battlefront of northern Mali during the 1980s and the Tuareg Rebellion during the early 1990s. It was during this time that the group's founding members first came to play together as political exiles in tents and around campfires of refugee settlements. The rehearsals for and recording of the album were conducted in similar way to those original performances. Tinariwen, in addition to largely substituting both acoustic guitars and unamplified percussion for their usual electric guitars (reflecting their return to an older way of life), also had hundreds of pounds of recording equipment and other gear transported to a canyon deep in the desert (running off a generator placed far enough from the microphones in the main tent to prevent noise pollution). Gregory Davis and Roger Lewis of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, with arrangement by Ian Brennan, contributed to the fourth track \\"Ya Messinagh\\". Kyp Malone and Tunde Adebimpe from the American art rock band, TV on the Radio, traveled to the isolated recording site in Mali, staying eight days and contributing backing vocal harmonies on five tracks and lead vocals on one track. They had first met Tinariwen two years before at the Coachella festival in California when the two bands were on the same bill. Nels Cline, the guitarist from the American alternative rock band Wilco, played on the first track, \\"Imidiwan Ma Tenam\\". The album was mixed by David Odlum at Studio Soyuz in Paris during February 2011 and at Studio Black Box in Angers during March 2011. It was mastered by John Golden at the Golden Mastering recording studio in Ventura, California during April 2011.http://goldenmastering.com/engineers/john-golden/  Reception  Bob Boilen stated in a review of the album for NPR Music that \\"Tinariwen is just about the best guitar-based rock band of the 21st century.\\" Elysa Gardner of USA Today gave the album 2.5 stars out of 4. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received a score of 80, based on 37 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Uncut placed the album at number 18 on its list of the top 50 albums of 2011. Mojo placed the album at number 35 on its list of \\"Top 50 albums of 2011.\\" On 12 February 2012, the album won a Grammy Award for Best World Music Album.

The history of Scots law traces the development of Scots law from its early beginnings as a number of different custom systems among Scotland's early cultures to its modern role as one of the three legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. The various historic sources of Scots law, including custom, feudal law, canon law, Roman law and English law have created a hybrid or mixed legal system, which shares elements with English law and Northern Irish law but also has its own unique legal institutions and sources. Origins The nature of Scots law before the 12th century is largely speculative but most likely was a folk-right system applying a specific customary legal tradition to a certain culture inhabiting a certain corresponding area at the time, e.g. Brehon law for the Gaels (Scoti and men of Galloway and Ayrshire), Welsh law for lowland Britons of Yr Hen Ogledd, Udal law for the Norse of Caithness and the islands, and Anglo-Saxon custom in Lothian and Borders.Scottish Legal History: A Research Guide, Georgetown Law Library, Retrieved 2011-10-22 The earliest preserved Scottish law code is the Leges inter Brettos et Scottos, promulgated under David I (r. 1124 ‚Äì 1153) and regulating Welsh and Gaelic custom. The Leges Quatuor Burgorum (‚ÄòLaws of the Four Burghs‚Äô) was promulgated sometime between 1135‚Äì57 and regulated Lothian law. It is difficult to say with any certainty to what degree contemporary Scots law still incorporates these customary sources. There is evidence to suggest that as late as the 17th century marriage laws in the Highlands and Islands still reflected Gaelic custom, contrary to Catholic religious principles.Stair, vol. 22, para. 504 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 The formation of the Kingdom of Scotland and its subjugation of the surrounding cultures, completed by the Battle of Carham, established what is approximately the boundaries of contemporary mainland Scotland.Reid, p. 15 The Outer Hebrides were added after the Battle of Largs in 1263 and the Northern Isles were acquired in 1469, completing what is today the legal jurisdiction of Scotland.Reid, p. 16 Feudalism In the 12th century King David I began the gradual introduction of feudalism in Scotland and established feudal land tenure over many parts of the south and east, which eventually spread northward.Stair, vol. 22, para. 505 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26Reid, p. 20 As feudalism began to develop in Scotland a number of separate court systems developed. Sheriffs were appointed by the King in the south and over time spread north. Their scope gradually developed and they were fully established across mainland Scotland by 1300.Reid, p. 23 The sheriffs were originally appointed by the King as royal administrators and tax collectors but their powers grew and as early as 1214 they were holding court to hear a variety of cases.Stair, vol. 22, para. 508 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 Feudal lords were also normally permitted to hold court where disputes between their tenants, including criminal matters, were adjudicated. By the 14th century some of these feudal courts had developed into \\"petty kingdoms\\" where the King's courts did not have authority, except for cases of treason.Stair, vol. 22, para. 509 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 Burghs, towns which had been given this special status usually by the King, also had their own set of local laws dealing mostly with commercial and trade matters. The burghs themselves established their own separate court system by authority of the King to administer and enforce these laws.Stair, vol. 22, para. 510 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 The burgh laws were collected as the Leges burgorum by 1270, though the laws applied by the burgh courts and the sheriff courts were similar.Reid, p. 24 Ecclesiastical courts also played an important role in Scotland as they had exclusive jurisdiction over matters such as marriage, contracts made on oath, inheritance and legitimacy.Reid, p. 30 These courts, unlike their lay counterparts, were generally staffed by educated men who were trained in both Roman and Canon law and offered a more sophisticated form of justice. Litigants seem to have preferred to bring disputes before the ecclesiastical courts or an ecclesiastical arbiter rather than the lay courts in Scotland.Stair, vol. 22, para. 511 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 Wars of Independence During the period of English control over Scotland there is some evidence to suggest that King Edward I attempted to abolish Scottish laws that were contrary to English law, as he had done in Wales.Reid, p. 36 King Edward I also reformed the legal institutions of Scotland during this period with the organisation of a Scottish government in September 1305. He also sent out pairs of justices, one Englishman and one Scotsman, to oversee different regions in Scotland. During the Wars of Scottish Independence legal developments in Scotland appeared to have slowed, likely affected by the widespread social turmoil. There is some evidence that there were attempts to codify the law of the time and a small number of reforming statutes were passed by the Parliament of Scotland evidencing at least some concern for remedying deficiencies in the law.Stair, vol. 22, para. 514 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 Under Robert the Bruce the importance of the Parliament of Scotland grew as he called them more frequently and its composition shifted to include more representation from the burghs and lesser landowners.Reid, p. 38 In 1399, a General Council established that the King should hold a parliament at least once a year for the next three years so, \\"that his subjects are served by the law\\".Legislation - Records of the Parliaments of Scotland, 1399/1/13. Translation: \\"Item, it is ordained that each year the king shall hold a parliament so that his subjects are served by the law, which shall begin on the morning after All Hallows' day [2 November], for the next three years.\\" In 1318, a parliament at Scone enacted a code of law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and the conduct of the war.Reid, p. 40 Nevertheless, the Act also codified procedures for criminal trials and protections for vassals from ejection from the land.Reid, p. 41 Scotland's three oldest universities, the University of St Andrews, the University of Glasgow and the University of Aberdeen were also founded following the wars and the Education Act 1496 was passed requiring those who administered justice in Scotland to learn Latin and study law for at least 3 years at school.The Records of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707, Retrieved 22-10-2011 From the 14th century we have surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts).Stair, vol. 22, para. 512 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 Both of these important texts, as they were copied, had provisions from Roman law and the ius commune inserted or developed, demonstrating the influence which both these sources had on Scots law.Reid, p. 46 Stewart Dynasty The Stewart dynasty, founded by King Robert II in 1371, was defined by the growing authority and power of the Scottish Kings and development of existing legal institutions. In 1469, the Parliament of Scotland affirmed the ultimate authority of King James III and rejected the authority of imperial notaries in Scottish civil matters.Reid, p. 50 The recognition of the sovereign authority of the Scottish Kings was connected to the influence of the ius commune in Scots law. For example, the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges of 1438 was an attempt to limit papal authority in France and recognise the sovereign authority of King Charles VII of France. Various customary laws, such as the Law of Clan MacDuff, came under attack from the Stewart Dynasty which consequently extended the reach of Scots common law.Reid, p. 56 From the reign of King James I to King James V the beginnings of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised.Reid, p. 52 The Parliament of Scotland was normally called on an annual basis during this period, with the notable exception of King James IV, and its membership was further defined.Reid, p. 54 The number of burghs also continued to expand, including the introduction of burghs of barony, and their authority remained largely undisturbed.Reid, p. 55 The evolution of the modern Court of Session also traces its history to the 15th and early 16th century with the establishment of a specialised group of councillors to the King evolving from the King's Council who dealt solely with the administration of justice. In 1528, it was established that the Lords of Council not appointed to this body were to be excluded from its audiences and it was also this body that four years later in 1532 became the College of Justice.Stair, vol. 22, para. 515 (Online) Retrieved 2011-10-26 The growing activity of the parliament and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts of the parliament to the courts and other enforcers of the law. There was still a great reliance on the old laws, codified in the Regiam Majestatem and Quoniam Attachiamenta among others, which persisted.Reid, p. 65 Throughout the late 15th century various unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law.Reid, p. 66 The legal uncertainty which this situation created prompted increased reliance on the ius commune found in Canon law and there are a number of examples of statutes from this period which clearly drew from Roman law.Reid, p. 67 Men educated in the law also became increasingly important alongside the early development of the College of Justice and ecclesiastical courts, filling the need for experts in advocacy, pleading and court procedure. The study of law was popular in Scotland and many students travelled to Continental Europe to study canon law and civil law.Reid, p. 68 In 1532, when the College of Justice established rules of practice and a closed list of ten lawyers permitted to appear before them, six had studied law abroad.Reid, p. 70 This also expanded the influence of Roman law and the ius commune on the Scottish common law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the ius commune embodied in civil and canon law, which had the advantage of being written.Reid, p. 73 Great Britain The Act of Union 1707 unified the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England to form Great Britain. Article 19 of the Act confirmed the continuing authority of the College of Justice, Court of Session and Court of Justiciary in Scotland.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , p. 100.See Act of Union 1707, Wikisource Article 3, however, merged the Parliament of Scotland with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain, with its seat in the Palace of Westminster, London.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 314. The Parliament of Great Britain was now unrestricted in altering laws concerning public right, policy and civil government, but concerning private right, only alterations for the evident utility of the subjects within Scotland were permitted. The Scottish Enlightenment then reinvigorated Scots law as a university-taught discipline. The transfer of legislative power to London and the introduction of appeal to the House of Lords (now to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom) brought further English influence. In the nineteenth century new areas of public policy that had not been part of Scottish law, in areas such as public health, working conditions, the protection of investors, were legislated for by the British Parliament, challenging the uniqueness of the system.M. Lynch, Scotland a New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 357. Acts of the Parliament began to create unified legal statutes applying in both England and Scotland, particularly when conformity was seen as necessary for pragmatic reasons (such as the Sale of Goods Act 1893). Appeal decisions by English judges raised concerns about this appeal to a foreign system, and in the late 19th century Acts allowed for the appointment of Scottish Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. At the same time, a series of cases made it clear that no appeal lay from the High Court of Justiciary to the House of Lords. Today the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom usually has a minimum of two Scottish justices to ensure that some Scottish experience is brought to bear on Scottish appeals.Profiles: UK Supreme Justices, BBC News, 30 September 2009. Scots law has continued to change and develop, with the most significant change coming under devolution and the formation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Jack King. The short was released on October 17, 1934, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series. Summary The film opens to an old house on a barren hill; within sits the Mad Musician at his piano, playing Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2. A tree branch climbs through the window, and, at the Musician's magical behest, plays the keys. But the branch's playing of \\"Shake your Powder Puff\\" visibly disappoints the Musician, who then plays some more, disappoints himself, and cries out for inspiration, laughing madly: he walks over to a table, taps the bottom of a bottle, and out pops a frog, which the Musician bewitches, as the branch before, into playing. But the frog disappoints his master with a rendition of \\"Amaryllis\\", and so happily leaps off of the keys and away into a picture of a pond. The Musician makes a portrait of a man in uniform to play a violin, which the painted figure breaks, to the Mad Musician's further aggravation. The cackling madman stalks about in contemplation. We come then to a newspaper headline: \\"Extra! Mad Musician Escapes!\\" And who should be reading the paper but Cookie? We come back to the Musician, who opens a telephone directory and chooses, at random, a name: who but Cookie at 00 1/2 Cornbread Avenue? The musician calls Cookie, and, over the phone, magically entices her (a tough customer, he admits!) to come to him: Cookie stalks out the door, but Bozo the Dog remains. Bozo sniffs about for a trail and then rushes off to find Buddy. Our Hero sits at home, in a chair, admiring a picture of Cookie. Bozo knocks over Buddy's chair, breaks the frame of the photograph and yelps wildly at Buddy. Buddy at first, can not decipher what Cookie's pet wants him to know, until Bozo picks up the picture of Cookie. Buddy then dons an outfit resembling that of Sherlock Holmes and rushes out the door with Bozo. Meanwhile, the Musician commands Cookie to play, at the piano, the same prelude that he attempted before, to flawed success: Cookie devolves, to her master's consternation, into a rendition of the jazzy \\"Hey, Sailor!\\" Buddy the sleuth finds the house, and burns a rectangular hole in the locked door by shining a flashlight through his magnifying glass. The audience gets to see that this is a haunted house; a gremlin creeps into Buddy's flashlight and spooks Bozo. Skeletons creep about, getting themselves water, which passes directly through them, from a water cooler, and opening umbrellas that are, as they, mere skeletons. The dog chases a skeleton into a wall, where it breaks apart. A curtain flies off of an open window as a result of the gust outside and Bozo slips on it into the next room, taking Buddy with him. The dog rushes through a threshold, but Buddy is knocked upwards onto a balcony, from which he can clearly see Cookie when she briefly emerges from a doorway to scream for help. Buddy finds his way over the balcony and knocks on the very door, but the Musician peeks out of a little hole in the top and taunts Our Hero. The door is locked, so Buddy simply picks up a nearby door and drops it next to the one through which he wishes to enter the room. Easily attaining access in this clever fashion, Buddy spies the Musician still standing at the door, unaware of his enemy's entrance. Buddy kicks the Mad Musician in the back side, and a fight ensues! Buddy kicks the villain through the door, which spins about as if on an axis, and flips the Musician back into the room. The Musician finds Buddy, but Buddy quickly grabs his opponent's hair and spins him around, freeing him only to knocks him into a wall. Buddy puts a small playing stool on the stunned villain's back and spins the top part. The stool's midsection extends from the Musician's back to the ceiling, thus trapping him on the floor. Cookie, saved, thanks her sweetheart, and begins to play the Rachmaninoff piece, but swiftly changes to the same jazzy piece that she played before and that the villain clearly cannot stand! The Musician's phone book In addition to Cookie's name, the names of three Schlesinger employees appear in the Musician's phone directory: R. Clampett, Ben Clopton, and Manny Corral, a cameraman. Cookie As is characteristic only of those Buddy cartoons directed by Jack King (though not all of them), Cookie has braided blond hair.

Among the many mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of synaptic plasticity is the cadherin‚Äìcatenin complex. By forming complexes with intracellular catenin proteins, neural cadherins (N-cadherins) serve as a link between synaptic activity and synaptic plasticity, and play important roles in the processes of learning and memory. N-cadherins are believed to be involved in mediating LTP and the synaptic changes underlying learning and memory. During embryonic development, cadherins are initially widely distributed, but they become gradually more localized to pre- and post- synaptic sites while synapses are being formed. Blocking cadherin function with specific proteins does not affect basal synaptic properties, but it can impair the induction of LTP. Structural function and adhesion Structure of the cadherin‚Äìcatenin complex N-cadherins are transmembrane proteins expressed in the majority of CNS synapses. N-cadherins are most commonly expressed on both the presynaptic active zone and postsynaptic density (PSD) regions, and contain both extracellular Ca2+ binding domains as well as intracellular domains for binding their protein partners. A common binding partner for Cadherins are intracellular catenin proteins, specifically the three different subtypes, Œ±-catenins, Œ≤-catenins, and p120ctn family catenins. Œ≤-catenins and p120ctns bind cadherin‚Äôs intracellular domain at the distal and proximal regions respectively. Œ±-catenins, when in monomeric form, will associate with the cadherin-catenin complex via Œ≤-catenins. In homodimeric form, Œ±-catenins do not bind Œ≤- catenins, but preferentially bind F-actin and other proteins promoting F-actin polymerization. Each catenin subtype and its interaction with cadherins plays a distinct role in the mediation of synaptic plasticity and spine structure. Regulation of adhesion Evidence suggest that N-Cadherins stabilize the connection between the presynaptic terminal and postsynaptic spine and that this stabilization increases the likelihood that released glutamate will bind receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. At basal levels of synaptic activity, N-cadherins are largely monomers and are thus weakly adhesive to cadherins located in the cell on the opposite side of the synapse. The influx of Ca2+ through NMDARs, promotes the dimerization of N-cadherins. Dimerized cadherins readily bind to their presynaptic cadherin partners. Inhibition of N-cadherin binding via blocking antibodies prevents the induction of late phase L-long term potentiation, suggesting that the adhesive property of dimeric N-cadherin is necessary for late phase L-LTP. Additionally, KCl depolarization of the presynaptic axon both confers protease resistance to N-cadherins and disperses them throughout the PSD from their original clustering in synaptic puncta, thus increasing their efficacy for cell adhesion. N-cadherin adhesion further stabilizes the synapse by enabling AMPAR-activation-induced spine head expansion. This morphological change helps to prevent further synaptic modifications that could jeopardize the information held by the already existing synaptic connections. Spine head expansion accomplishes this by reducing the NMDAR to AMPAR ratio, creating a proportionally smaller calcium influx, as well as by allowing for faster calcium diffusion out of the spine. The rapid removal of calcium prevents it from initiating the post-translational modifications that would further alter synaptic strength. Overexpression of an N-cadherin mutant incapable of adhesion prevents spine head expansion, demonstrating N-cadherin‚Äôs essential role in this process. Regulation of cadherin surface levels, turnover, and stability Regulation mechanisms differ in their synthesis requirements and their temporal initiation. One mode of cadherin regulation is surface stabilization, a fairly rapid process (occurring approximately 100 minutes after activity) that is independent of protein synthesis. NMDAR activity reduces phosphorylation of Œ≤-catenin at tyr-654, thereby inhibiting N-cadherin endocytosis and facilitating surface retention and expression. Surface expression is also regulated via protocadherin-mediated adhesion. Protocadherin-alpha and protocadherin-gamma interact to form a protein complex that enhances the surface expression of each cadherin subtype. Cadherin expression is also regulated by activity-induced internalization, which occurs much later than surface stabilization (an average of 4 hours after the stimulus). Internalization is dependent on protein synthesis, and p120 catenin proteins (p120ctn) are implicated in the turnover, degradation and ‚Äòclustering‚Äô of cadherins into the adhesive junctions at the synapse. P120 ctn proteins are thought to either inhibit endocytosis of neural cadherins, or act at the cell surface to control cadherin turnover. Down-regulation of p120 ctn leads to greater cadherin endocytosis and prevents adhesion between the pre and post-synaptic neuron. Such evidence strongly suggests that p120 is necessary for cadherin stability. Binding and signaling Intracellular binding partners Œ≤-catenin localizes reserve pool vesicles (RPVs) at presynaptic sites. The deletion of Œ≤-catenin in vivo results in a decrease in the number of RPVs localized in the synaptic site and an increase in RPVs dispersed along the axon. Moreover, RPVs were unresponsive to continuous trains of stimulation of the presynaptic neuron in B-catenin knockouts. This effect of B-catenin is independent of cadherin-mediated adhesion, and is instead modulated by PDZ binding proteins such as Veli to cadherin. Additionally, BDNF/TrkB signaling leads to the phosphorylation of Œ≤-catenin at its Y654 site, causing the Œ≤-catenin‚Äìcadherin complex to dissolve and consequently increasing synaptic vesicle mobility. Catenins also bind many scaffolding proteins, receptors, kinases and phosphatases. For example, the cadherin-Œ±-catenin complex binds the actin cytoskeleton, though whether it binds via binding proteins or direct interactions is unknown. Signal transduction pathways Catenin‚Äìcadherin signaling p120ctn signals through guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GAPs to activate the Rho family of GTPases. RhoA must be inhibited by P120ctn to maintain spine density and length. Rac (GTPase) inhibition remediates a reduction of spine density in p120ctn deficiency. E-cadherin binding to p120ctn may activate SRC leading to activation of Rac1 which results in phosphorylation of LIMK1 and LIMK2 to deactivate cofilin causing G-actin polymerization. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of PI3K by SRC activates RhoA which leads to activation of cofilin-P and disruption of filamentous actin. When the WAVE-1 gene was disrupted in mice, it resulted in cognitive defects such as losses in learning and memory implicating the WAVE-1 branch of the Rac pathway. Using an in vivo dentate gyrus LTP model, it was shown that LTP induction is associated with an increase in F-actin in the dendritic spines, and this is a long lasting change. It was shown that NMDA receptor activation is required for this effect. Furthermore, the use of latrunculin A was able to impair late phase LTP in this model, again suggesting that actin remodelling is necessary for LTP. Cellular function Role in receptor trafficking/stability When the glutamate receptor binding protein ABP and p120ctn are co-expressed, anti-p120ctn serum pulls out a complex containing both proteins from cell lysates. The same occurs for a protein similar to ABP, called GRIP. cDNA screening and yeast mating assays demonstrate that the PDZ domain-binding motif at the p120ctn C-terminus enables such interactions. Co-IP data shows that p120ctn can simultaneously complex with cadherin and either ABP or GRIP. Dominant negative p120ctn fragments, which failed to interact with ABP and GRIP, impaired the stabilization of GluR2 and GluR3 AMPAR subunits, respectively, at the plasma membrane. Co-localization of p120ctn with PSD-95 suggests that cadherin-p120ctn-ABP/GRIP complexes anchor AMPARs at the postsynaptic density, but it is unclear whether anchoring also occurs at perisynaptic sites. Regulation of gene expression First steps of Mechanism for the Role of N-cadherins in Regulating Gene Expression Subsequent steps of Mechanism for the Role of N-cadherins in Regulating Gene Expression Cadherins and catenins have been shown to be involved in regulating gene expression, an important process in synaptic plasticity. Glutamate binding to NMDA upregulates the production of N-cadherin‚Äôs intracellular domain peptide, N-cad/CTF2, an effect blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist, APV. Transfection of N-cad/CTF2 decreases nuclear CBP (CREB-binding protein) and increases cytosolic CBP. Furthermore, N-cad/CTF2 co-immunoprecipitates with CBP, and transfection of N-cad/CTF2 reduces CBP steady state levels, consequently impairing CREB-containing DNA complex formation (See figures on the right). Expression of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1) triggers the translocation of Œ≤-catenin to the nucleus, where it upregulates transcription, and transfection of N-cadherin or Œ±-catenin reverses this effect. Additionally, treating neurons with NMDAR agonist causes cleavage of the Œ≤-catenin N-terminus, and the C-terminal fragments translocate to the nucleus, where, as transfection experiments show, Œ≤-catenin increases T-cell factor (TCF) dependent transcription.

It provides refuge to local and migratory wildlife specially waterfowl and other water birds. The area is a subset of the entire Najafgarh drain in rural south west Delhi with forested plantations on both its embankments which has been proposed as the Najafgarh drain bird sanctuary. History Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit inaugurated the city forest at Chhawla on the banks of the Najafgarh drain in South-West Delhi on Saturday 28 Jun 2008. Over 12,000 saplings were planted including 1,000 saplings by school children. In all, nine city forests in different parts of Delhi were set up and 18 lakh saplings were planted during that greening drive in Delhi. Chhawla city forest covers a 12-hectare terrain that originally belonged to the Irrigation and Flood Control Department and a boundary wall has been constructed around it.Another city forest opened - Delhi will soon have 32 of them, says Sheila, New Delhi, 29 Jun 2008, The Hindu NewspaperRECORDED FORESTS (NOTIFIED FOREST AREAS IN DELHI), Forest Department, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, India Najafgarh drain or nullah The Najafgarh drain or Najafgarh Nallah (nullah in Hindi means drain) is just another name for the River Sahibi which continues its flow through Delhi, it is a tributary to River Yamuna in which it outfalls here.

Wildlife and waterbirds can be easily viewed from vehicles by driving on this road and stopping intermittently and going down to the waters edge. As the width of the drain is limited the flocks of waterfowl and other waterbirds in the drain can be easily observed from the drain's edges and this same fact makes the birds much more vulnerable to hunting as they remain in easy reach of the poacher's shotguns and the nets and traps set for them by local villagers and professional trappers.

The area came to be recognized as an important wildlife habitat after a local naturalist studying the area during 1986-88 called attention to it recommending it to be conserved as a bird sanctuary after which the Delhi wildlife department posted 16 guards in the area to control illegal bird hunters including diplomats from various international embassies located in Delhi, India's capital. Delhi Administration officials were tasked with declaring about 25 km stretch of the drain in rural delhi, including where is passes through the core area of the now drained Najafgarh Lake, \\"protected\\" under the \\"Wildlife Act\\" after Lt.-Governor of Delhi Mr. H.L.

History At the beginning of February 2008 the Labour Government published a document called Strategy for the Future of Apprenticeships in England. It introduced a quango, the National Apprenticeship Service. The National Skills Director of the Learning and Skills Council was to be in charge of the NAS. The LSC at the time had had most of its funding farmed out to local authorities. The NAS was to be part of the LSC, as outlined in the government's 2008 document on apprenticeships. Two new divisions in the LSC were formed at the same time - one for young people headed by Rob Wye, and one for adult education and training headed by Chris Roberts. All of the three new divisions were still at this stage part of the LSC, and not separate entities. At the time six government agencies had some responsibility for apprenticeships, but there was no overall leadership. At the time of its formation, the Labour Government up to that point had been heavily focused on persuading 50% of under-18s to attend university. In other European countries, much more focus is placed on apprenticeships; only 6% of English companies offer apprenticeships compared to 30% in Germany. In England, those who by age of 25 had been on an apprenticeship are likely to earn much more than those who do not, for similar qualifications (¬£100,000 over a career). A university degree is often quoted as improving earning potential, but is highly dependent on choice of degree, and apprenticeships have a much higher success rate on earning potential.

They follow the interpretation of the Rule of St. Clare established by Saint Colette in 1410, originally a French hermit and member of the Third Order of St. Francis. History Colette was born in Corbie, a town in the Picardy region of France in January 1381 to an elderly couple.\\"St. Colette of Corbie\\" Our Lady of Mercy Monastery, Belleville, Illinois She lost her parents in 1399 and, after a brief stint in a beguinage, in 1402 she received the religious habit of the Third Order of St. Francis and became a hermit, living in a hut near the parish church, under the spiritual direction of the abbot of the local Benedictine abbey. After four years of following this ascetic way of life, in 1406, Colette came to believe that she was being called to reform the Poor Clares, the Second Order of the Franciscan movement, and return that Order to its original Franciscan ideals of absolute poverty and austerity. Foundation In October of that year, she traveled to Nice to seek the blessing of the Antipope Benedict XIII, who was recognized in France at that time as the rightful pope. Benedict received her and allowed her to take vows as a Poor Clare nun, giving her mission his blessing through several papal bulls, which authorized her both to reform existing monasteries and to found new ones according to her reform. After spending several years in Beaune in the Duchy of Burgundy, under the guidance of the Blessed Henry of Beaume, O.F.M., (ca. 1367-1439) in 1410 they transferred to the County of Burgundy in 1408, where she established the first successful community of Poor Clare nuns under her inspired way of life in a semi-derelict monastery of the Order in Besan√ßon. Expansion From Besan√ßon her reform spread to Auxonne (1412), to Amiens. It began to spread outside France with foundations in Heidelberg, Germany (1444), and from there to other communities of Poor Clares around Europe. In total, 18 monasteries were founded before her death in March 1447. Colette established a reform community in Poligny in 1415, and from there another in Ghent in 1442. From Ghent, a Colettine community was established in Bruges in 1457. In 1857 Poor Clares from Bruges established a monastery at Notting Hill. In 1928, Bishop Francis Vaughan asked his cousin, Mother Felix Clare Vaughan, abbess of Notting Hill, to send sisters to his Welsh diocese, and the community of Ty Mam Duw was founded. For the monasteries which followed her reform, Colette prescribed extreme poverty, going barefoot, and the observance of perpetual fasting and abstinence. The Colettines follow their own Constitutions sanctioned in 1434 by the then-Minister General of the friars, William of Casale, and approved in 1448 by Pope Nicholas V, in 1458 by Pope Pius II, and in 1482 by Pope Sixtus IV. The community includes both cloistered nuns and extern sisters. Colettines in the United States In Germany, the late 19th- century saw a major wave of suppressions of monastic institutions under the government policy of Kulturkampf. Among them was the Colettine monastery in D√ºsseldorf, whose members had been expelled from their home. They sought a place of refuge in the United States and sent requests to various dioceses around the country. The Bishop of Cleveland agreed to receive them into his diocese, and five nuns of the German community travelled there in 1877, establishing a small monastery in the city on Perry Street. They were the first monastery of the Order of St. Clare in North America. In 1916 Bishop Peter James Muldoon, of Rockford, Illinois invited the sisters in Cleveland to establish a presence in his diocese.Corpus Christi Monastery, Rockford, Illinois The Poor Clare Monastery of Our Lady of Mercy, in Belleville, Illinois, under the patronage of Our Lady of Guadalupe, was founded in June 1986 from the Poor Clare Monastery of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Roswell, New Mexico. Seven founding sisters arrived in Kokomo, Indiana in 1959, at the invitation of Most Rev. John J. Carberry, the bishop of the Diocese of Lafayette-in-Indiana.Monastery of Poor Clares, Kokomo, Indiana Today there are also monasteries in California, Illinois and South Carolina. Foundations from the American monasteries have been established in Brazil (1950) and the Netherlands (1990). Friars A branch of Franciscan friars following the spirit of Colette's reform was established and approved, under the leadership of Henry de Beaume. They were known as Coletans, and were connected to the monasteries of the Colettine nuns. By 1448, there were thirteen friaries of this branch. Along with other smaller reforms, they were merged by the Holy See into the Observant branch of the friars in 1517.

Filial cannibalism occurs in many animal species ranging from mammals to insects, and is especially prevalent in various species of fish. Although not much is known regarding the exact purposes of filial cannibalism, it is understood that it may have important evolutionary and ecological implications for some species, and is an important source of mortality for various species. Types Total Total or whole clutch cannibalism occurs when a parent consumes its entire brood. This usually occurs when a brood is smaller or of lesser quality. The most obvious purpose of total or whole clutch cannibalism is the termination of care for the parents. The main benefit of this action can only be an investment in the future reproduction of potentially larger or healthier broods. Partial Partial clutch cannibalism occurs when a parent consumes a part of its offspring. \\"Parental manipulation of brood size may allow the parent the maximize lifetime reproductive output by adjusting current reproductive costs in favour of future survival and subsequent opportunities for reproduction.\\" Unlike total or whole clutch cannibalism, partial clutch cannibalism invests in both current and future reproduction. Male parents, particularly male fish, may eat some of their offspring \\"complete his current parental cycle, and remain in sufficiently good condition to engage in further breeding cycles.\\" Benefits *Satisfies current energy or nutrition requirements *In a bad reproductive environment, is a way to recoup reproductive investment *Puts evolutionary pressure on offspring to make the offspring develop quicker *May increase the reproductive rate of a parent by making that parent more attractive to potential mates *Gets rid of offspring that take too long to mature *Removes weaker offspring in an overproduced brood, which makes the other offspring more likely to succeed Costs *Loss of fitness *Transmission of diseases and parasites *Decrease of success in current reproduction Social factors Competition among a species for resources, mating opportunities, and reproductive dominance are all promoters for filial cannibalism. To compete well in a certain species' social structure, a parent may be compelled to practice filial cannibalism to limit the amount of energy and time they spend raising their young. Males may compete for mating opportunities by eating the offspring of a female to make that female more sexually receptive or to re-mate. By doing this, a male might be able to prolong its lifetime mating opportunities. Female fish may compete for mating opportunities with males by raiding the male's nest and eating the eggs inside. Females may also use cannibalism ‚Äì particularly birds and bees that live in a joint-nesting social structure ‚Äì as a way to establish reproductive dominance by eating the eggs of a co-breeder. In some animal cultures, competition may lead to instances of egg thievery, nest takeovers, and cuckoldry.

It was developed in 1987 by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers at the University of Maryland Human ‚Äì Computer Interaction Lab. The QUIS is currently at Version 7.0 with demographic questionnaire, a measure of overall system satisfaction along 6 scales, and measures of 9 specific interface factors. These 9 factors are: screen factors, terminology and system feedback, learning factors, system capabilities, technical manuals, on-line tutorials, multimedia, teleconferencing, and software installation. Currently available in: German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.http://lap.umd.edu/quis/about.html  Background  When the QUIS was developed, a large number questionnaires concerning user subjective satisfaction had been developed. However, few of these exclusively focused on user evaluation of the interface itself. This was the motivation for the development of the QUISChin, J. P., Diehl, V. A. and Norman, K. L. (1988). Development of an instrument measuring user satisfaction of the human- computer interface. Proceedings of SIGCHI '88, (pp. 213-218), New York: ACM/SIGCHI.  Version 1.0  In 1987, Ben Shneiderman presented a questionnaire that directed user attention to focus on their subjective rating of the human-computer interface. While this questionnaire was a strong step towards focus on users' evaluations of an interface, no empirical work had been done to assess its reliability or validity.  Version 2.0  This original questionnaire consisted of 90 questions in total. Of these questions, 5 were concerned with rating a user's overall reaction of the system. The remaining 85 were organized into 20 groups which, in turn, consisted of a main component question followed by related subcomponent questions. The reliability of the questionnaire was found to be high with Cronbach's alpha=.94  Version 3.0  QUIS Version 2.0 was modified and expanded to three major sections. In the first section, there were three questions concerned with the type of system under evaluation and the amount of time spent on that system. In the second section, four questions focused on the user's past computer experiences. The last section, section III, included the modified version of QUIS Version 2.0, now containing 103 questions. These modifications included changing the 1-10 rating scale to be from 1-9, which 0 used as \\"not applicable\\". This also simplified future data entry for the questionnaire since a maximum rating would no longer require two keystrokes (as it would have in \\"10\\"). This in turn would reduce response bias from subjects.  Version 4.0  Chin, Norman and Shneiderman (1987) administered the QUIS Version 3.0 and a subsequent revised Version 4.0 to an introductory computer science class learning to program in CF PASCAL. Participants, were assigned to either the interactive batch run IBM mainframe or an interactive syntax-directed editor programming environment on an IBM PC. They evaluated the environment they had used during the first 6 weeks of the course (version 3.0). Then, for the next 6 weeks, the participants switched programming environments and evaluated the new system with the QUIS Version 4.0. Although version 4.0 appeared to be reliable, there were limitations to the study due to sampling. The sample of the users doing the evaluation were limited to those in an academic community. There was a clear need to determine if the reliability of the QUIS would generalize to other populations of users and products, like a local PC User's Group.  Version 5.0  Another study using QUIS Version 5.0 was carried out with a local PC User's Group. In order to look at ratings across products, the participants were divided into 4 groups. Each group rated a different product. The products were: # a product the rater liked # a product the rater disliked # a command line system (CLS) # a Menu Driven Application (MDA) This investigation examined the reliability and discriminability of the questionnaire. In terms of discriminability, the researchers compared the ratings for software that was liked vs. the ratings for the software that was disliked. Lastly, a comparison between a mandatory CLS with that of a voluntarily chosen MDA was made. The researchers found that the overall reliability of QUIS Version 5.0 using Cronbach's alpha was .939. = Version 5.5 = Even though the QUIS Version 5.0 was a powerful tool for interface evaluation, interface issues limited the utility of the on-line version. Previous versions of the QUIS have been laid out in a very linear fashion, in which one question would be shown on each screen. However, this format is unable to capture the hierarchical nature of the question sets in the QUIS. This in turn limits the continuity between questions. QUIS 5.5 presented related sets of questions on the same screen. This helped improve question continuity within a set and reduced the amount of time subjects would spend navigating between questions. Users of the QUIS often avoided the on-line version because it failed to record specific user comments about the system. This was not acceptable since these comments are often vital for usability testing. In response to this need, QUIS Version 5.5 collected and stored comments online for each set of questions. The output format of the QUIS data was also a source of frustration. The original format made analysis confusing and error-prone. QUIS Version 5.5 stores data in a format that could be easily imported into most popular spreadsheet and statistical analysis applications. Overall, the most significant change to the QUIS in Version 5.5 is improved flexibility. Prior versions required experimenters to use all questions in all areas despite how most often, only a sub-set of the 80 questions was actually applicable to the interface under evaluation. QUIS Version 5.5 allowed experimenters to select subsets of the QUIS questions to display. Overall, this saved subjects and experimenters time and effort.Harper, B. D. & Norman, K. L. (1993). Improving User Satisfaction: The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction Version 5.5. Proceedings of the 1st Annual Mid- Atlantic Human Factors Conference, (pp. 224-228), Virginia Beach, VA = Version 5.5 - Development of the Web Based QUIS = Standard HTML forms were used to let users interact with the QUIS Version 5.5. The online version's style is very similar to the paper version of the questionnaire. The online version displayed multiple questions per page and comment areas at the end of each section. In order to ensure that users considered each question, a response was required for each question (users were able to answer \\"Not Applicable\\"). Client-side JavaScript was used to both validate and format the user's responses. The data for each section of the QUIS was time stamped and recorded on the client computer. At the end of the questionnaire the data from all sections of the QUIS were gathered together and send as a single piece back to the server where the QUIS was deployed. This method of data collection ensures that only completed questionnaires were entered, and prevents concurrency issues between users.Slaughter, L. A., Harper, B. D. & Norman, K. L. (1994). Assessing the Equivalence of Paper and On-line versions of the QUIS 5.5. Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Mid-Atlantic Human Factors Conference, (pp. 87-91), Washington, D.C. = Version 5.5 Paper vs. Online Study = This study compared responses from paper and on-line formats of the QUIS Veresion 5.5. The majority of studies were interested in assessing equivalence between computerized and paper forms of tests. Overall, the results have not indicated significant differences. Twenty subjects evaluated WordPerfect¬© using both the paper and online formats of the QUIS Version 5.5. Each administration of the QUIS was preceded by a practice session to refamiliarize the subject with the interface. As the researchers expected, the format of the questionnaire did not affect users' ratings. However, it was of note that subjects using the online format wrote more in the comment sections than those who used the paper format. Also, the comments made by subjects using the online format provided better feedback in terms of problems, strengths, and examples. These results indicated that the online QUIS format provides more higher-quality information to developers, researchers and human factors experts than the paper-pencil format.

Version 7.0  The QUIS Version 7.0 is an updated and expanded version of the previously validated QUIS 5.5. It is arranged in a hierarchical format and contains: (1) a demographic questionnaire, (2) six scales that measure overall reaction ratings of the system, (3) four measures of specific interface factors: screen factors, terminology and system feedback, learning factors, system capabilities, and (4) optional sections to evaluate specific components of the system. These specific components include: # technical manuals and online help # on-line tutorials # multimedia # Internet access # software installation Additional space allowing the rater to make comments regarding the interface is also included within the questionnaire. The comment space is headed by a statement that prompts the rater to comment on each of the specific interface factors.  Current  In addition to English, the QUIS 7.0 is currently available in the following languages: German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazilian), and Spanish. In Fall 2011, a group of University of Maryland students began work updating the QUIS Version 7.0.

It was later reissued with the new title by Codemasters who also published conversions for 16-bit computers. The game offers a variety of boxing moves including fouls. The game received mixed reviews. Gameplay In game shot (Amstrad CPC). The red player outline in the top corner indicates Player 2 is being watched by the refereeThe game can be played either as a two-player versus game or single-player against the computer. The objective of the one player game is to attempt to become the World Champion by defeating six opponents. The opponents become progressively more difficult to beat. The player can then continue to defend their title against difficult opponents. The game features a wide range of moves including fair moves (punches, jabs, uppercuts) and foul moves (kicks, knees, head butts, groin punches) as well as blocks and dodging moves. Foul moves can be made when the referee is not looking but lead to a loss of 'chance' (or life) if seen. Indicators on screen let the player know when the referee is likely to notice foul moves. Successful hits reduce the opponent's energy bar. When the energy bar reaches zero, the player is knocked out but this just ends the round. The player with the lowest energy at the end of the round loses a 'chance'. As the game is played, members of the audience make comments which are shown on screen as speech bubbles.

Frequency selective pulses are used in MRI to isolate a slice through the subject for excitation, inversion and saturation. Given a desired magnetization profile, determining the RF pulse that produces it is generally nonlinear, due to the non-linearity of the Bloch equations. At low tip angles, the RF excitation waveform can be approximated by the inverse Fourier Transform of the desired frequency profile, using the excitation kspace analysis. The small tip angle approximation continues to hold well for tip angles on the order of 90 degree. However, for tip angles greater than 90 degree, a different approach must be used.

It was named after Prince Frederick of Prussia. Fredericksburg is also notable as the home of Texas German, a dialect spoken by the first generations of German settlers who initially refused to learn English. Fredericksburg shares many cultural characteristics with New Braunfels, which had been established by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels the previous year. 19th century Fredericksburg (German: Friedrichsburg) was founded in 1846 by Baron Otfried Hans von Meusebach, new Commissioner General of the \\"Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in Texas\\", also known as the \\"Noblemen's Society\\" (in German: Mainzer Adelsverein). The emigration was in part the liberal, educated Germans fleeing the social, political, and economic conditions that later resulted in the Revolution of 1848, and in part working- class Germans. Freethinkers Association of Central Texas Baron von Meusebach renounced his noble title and became known in Texas as John O. Meusebach. The area's Barons Creek was named in Meusebach's honor. Meusebach-Comanche Treaty Bust of Baron von Meusebach in Fredericksburg Town Square The reddish-blonde haired John O. Meusebach was named El Sol Colorado (The Red Sun) by Penateka Comanche Chief Ketemoczy (Katemcy), who had encountered Meusebach and his group in the area of present-day Mason.King (1967) p.112Morgenthaler (2007) p.66 Meusebach, accompanied by geologist Ferdinand von Roemer, Special Agent Robert Neighbors, F. Shubbert, Jean Jacques von Coll, trader John F. Torrey and interpreter Anton Felix Hans Hellmuth von Bl√ºcher (aka Felix A. von Bl√ºcher), brokered the 1847 Treaty between the Comanche and the German Immigration Company. The treaty was unique in that it did not take away the rights of the Penateka Comanche, but was an agreement that the Comanche and settlers would mutually share the land, co-existing in peace and friendship. Meusebach paid the Penateka Comanches $3,000, slightly less than $70,000 in today's money, in food, gifts, and other commodities for their participation in the signing of the agreement. The native American signers of the treaty were only from the Penateka band.

In Germany and the Catholic Church, variations have occurred on the custom of lighting hilltop evening bonfires in close proximity of Easter to celebrate the coming of spring. The Fredericksburg variation is a living- history event which celebrates the signing of the 1847 Meusebach-Comanche Treaty. While the treaty was signed after Easter, the final negotiations were completed on March 1 and 2, with Easter of 1847 occurring on April 3. The Fredericksburg Easter Fires legend has it that Penateka Comanches signaled each other about the progress of the treaty negotiations by lighting huge fires on the hills. Settler mothers calmed their children by giving a twist on the traditional German story of Easter fires, and telling children the fires on the hills were lit by bunnies who were boiling water to make eggs for Easter morning. In some versions of the story, the Comanches lit the fires to celebrate the signing of the treaty, and the bunnies were boiling Texas wildflowers to make the colors for the eggs. The pageant is held traditionally the Saturday before Easter, and recreates the signing of the treaty with bunny-dressed participants of all ages lighting the fires on surrounding hillsides. The show has been a big tourist draw since 1946. The pageant was suspended in recent years due to cost and logistics, but a group of citizens is trying to revive it. Town founding Fredericksburg, Texas 1896 parade celebrating 50th anniversary of the town's founding. Vereins Kirche in the background. House of Heinrich G. Dietz In 1845, Meusebach set out from New Braunfels, traveling northwest to select the second settlement of the Fisher- Miller Land Grant. He opted for a valley situated between two creeks, which are now known as Barons Creek and Town Creek, and surrounded by seven hills. He named it in honor of Prince Frederick of Prussia, the highest-ranking member of the Mainzer Adelsverein and nephew of King Frederick William III of Prussia. For the settlement, he purchased on credit, for an allotment per settler of one town lot, plus of farmland.King (1967) p.73 In December 1845, on orders from Meusebach, Lieutenant Louis (Ludwig) Bene, along with lead surveyor Johann Jacob Groos and crew, constructed a road from New Braunfels to the site of Fredericksburg.Morgenthaler (2007) p.54,55 The town was laid out by surveyor Herman Wilke.Morgenthaler (2007) p.58 On April 23, 1846, the first wagon train of settlers left New Braunfels, encountering friendly Delaware Indians en route, and arrived at the Fredericksburg site on May 8, 1846.King (1967) p. 74 The first colonists immediately set about to plant a garden and build a storehouse out of logs, and a stockade and a blockhouse. The settlers soon received via courier a belated message from Governor James Pinckney Henderson advising them that uncertain movements by the government of Mexico made it unclear whether Texas could offer protection to the settlers. Governor Henderson advised against moving into the area at that time.King (1967) p.75 The settlers refused to return to New Braunfels. Meusebach designated Dr. Friedrich A. Schubbert, also known as Friedrich Armand Strubberg,King (1967) p.126 as director of the new colony, to lead a second expedition into Fredericksburg in June 1846.King (1967) p.76,91 Schubbert designed the Vereins Kirche, the first public building in Fredericksburg.Morgenthaler (2007) p.60 Without authorization from Meusebach, in 1846, Schubbert led an armed group of colonists into Comanche territory. Shawnee scouts reported seeing 40,000 to 60,000 Kickapoo at the Llano River, and Schubbert's group retreated to Fredericksburg.Morgenthaler (2007) p.59 Meusebach decided to enter Comanche territory himself, resulting in the treaty with the Penateka.King (1967) p.105 Ferdinand von Roemer arrived in Fredericksburg in January 1847, and described what he estimated to be a settlement of 600 people:Morgenthaler (2007) p.62 Roemer described a diet of bear meat, corn, and coffee. He reported that dysentery was a common ailment. He also noted the disease of \\"stomachache\\" that engulfed the lungs and throat, was treated with citric acid, but still caused daily fatalities.Morgenthaler (2007) p.64 Schubbert instigated a failed coup d'√©tat against Meusebach. Ninety-five colonists signed a petition urging Meusebach to remain as Commissioner-General.King (1967) pp.106,107 On July 12, 1847, Meusebach sent Schubbert a letter of dismissal from his position as director of Fredericksburg.King (1967) p.127 Jean Jacques von Coll was appointed his successor. Coll was a retired first lieutenant of the Duchy of Nassau, who had been appointed by Prince Solms as the first financial officer of New Braunfels. Coll was later elected mayor of New Braunfels in 1852.Solms (2000) p.126 On December 15, 1847, a petition was submitted to create Gillespie County. In 1848, the legislature formed Gillespie County from Bexar and Travis Counties. While the signers were overwhelmingly German immigrants, names also on the petition were Castillo, Pena, Munos, and a handful of non- German Anglo names. The first sheriff of the county was Louis (Ludwig) Martin, who emigrated from Erndtebr√ºck North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany with the first Adelsverein group aboard the Johann Detthard in 1844, and moved with the original settlers to Fredericksburg. He was one of the 1847 signers of the petition to create Gillespie County. He became district clerk in 1850. Guenther's Mill on Live Oak Creek painted in 1855 by Hermann Lungkwitz Wilhelm Victor Keidel, who emigrated from Hildesheim, Lower Saxony, Germany, became the area's first doctor and the first elected chief justice in 1848. Theodore Specht became the first postmaster of Fredericksburg on December 7, 1848. Specht was from Braunschweig, Germany, and emigrated to Fredericksburg with his wife Maria Berger in 1846. The Spechts operated a store out of their home that was frequented by Penateka Comanches. Local Penateka chief Santa Anna brought one of his wives to the store during a cold winter for her to give birth to a son. Pioneer Flour Mills was founded on Live Oak Creek in Fredericksburg in 1851 by Carl Hilmar Guenther, an immigrant from Weissenfels, Germany. He served as justice of the peace in 1856. In 1859, after two years of drought, the Guenther family moved the mills to San Antonio. Fort Martin Scott On July 1, 1850, an angry mob of 50 Fort Martin Scott soldiers burned down the store-courthouse in Fredericksburg, in a clash with store owner and County Clerk John M. Hunter over refusal to sell whiskey to a soldier. Soldiers also prevented townspeople from saving the county records. Civil War and Reconstruction Fredericksburg was primarily part of the pro-Union Texas resistance during the Civil War, but a portion of the population remained loyal to the Confederacy. While many Germans saw slavery as an evil, the 1860 census showed 33 slaves in Gillespie County. Matthew Gaines was a runaway slave from a Robertson County plantation and had been captured in 1863 by the Texas Rangers at Menard. He was taken to Fredericksburg, where he was forced to work for the duration of the war. Upon gaining his freedom, he moved to Burton, where he was eventually elected as a member of the Texas Senate. In 1877, the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church served both as a house of worship and as a school for black families in the area. The citizenry dealt with the spread of lawlessness during and after the war years. School teacher Louis Scheutze was kidnapped from his home and hanged, an act suspected to have been carried out by James P. Waldrip in response to Scheutze's vocal opposition to Confederate rule. Waldrip was alleged to have been part of the notorious Die Haengebande (Hanging Band) that handed out vigilante justice in the Hill Country. He was also a convicted thief and generally feared and disliked by people of the area. In 1867, Waldrip was shot by an unknown person outside the Nimitz Hotel. He was buried in secret, so as to prevent desecration of his grave. 20th and 21st centuries Der Lindenbaum reflects the German heritage of Fredericksburg. Estimated Fredericksburg population for 1904 was 1,632. Frank Stein built the town's first ice factory in 1907. From 1913 to 1942, the Fredericksburg and Northern Railway connected Fredericksburg to Waring. Fredericksburg was incorporated as a city in 1928. During the first half of the 20th century, Fredericksburg remained much like other Texas Hill County farm and ranch communities of German heritage, isolated from the commercialization of their culture. The most notable influxes of outsiders were sporadic visitors during events such as the Easter Fires, the county fair, and hunting season, but the population and its growth remained anchored to its roots. Things began to change when Lyndon B. Johnson became Vice President of the United States. Possibly the most momentous event in modern Fredericksburg happened on Sunday, April 16, 1961, when Johnson, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, and the first Chancellor of West Germany Konrad Adenauer helicoptered in to the Fredericksburg fairgrounds racetrack for a reception.Nimitz, Elmer Potter, pg 468 They were joined onstage by U.S. Congressman O. C. Fisher and John O. Meusebach's only surviving offspring, 95-year-old Mrs. Ernest Marschall of Llano. Crowd estimates were between 7,000 and 10,000. The 1960 population of Fredericksburg was only 4,629. Accompanying the dignitaries was an entourage of family members, German state officials, multiple security forces, and the national media. Speeches were in English (Nimitz, LBJ), and in German (everyone else) with no translation needed. The Austin Recording Company was on hand to tape the saengerfest segment of the program. The fest featured the Marychorale Choir of St. Mary's Catholic Church and Felix Pehl directing the Arlon M√§nnerchor. Chancellor Adenauer sang along with the Kinderchor portion of the fest, which was directed by Erna Dietel Heinan. The Fredericksburg High School Band entertained and appeared the following day at an Austin parade honoring the Chancellor. The Fredericksburg event was capped by a 10-car caravan tour of Fredericksburg, while Nimitz instead visited his relatives. On November 22, 1963, when Lyndon Johnson became President of the United States, global attention focused upon the Texas White House at nearby Stonewall. The Nimitz Hotel served as headquarters for the media who intertwined their favorable impressions of the area with their reporting on the President. The Johnsons attended church in Fredericksburg. Dignitaries were escorted around Fredericksburg by the President. West Germany Chancellor Ludwig Erhard visited Fredericksburg in 1963 and was greeted with \\"Herzlich Wilkommen\\" and heard a sermon in German at Bethany Lutheran Church. Throughout LBJ's vice presidency and presidency, Fredericksburg prospered from the tourism trade, and it changed from an isolated community into one catering to the tourist dollar. Fredericksburg capitalizes on its German heritage for tourists. Main Street (Hauptstrasse) Fredericksburg has profited from spill- over tourism of nearby Luckenbach ever since a few events propelled the little town with a population of three to global fame. Jerry Jeff Walker recorded his landmark 1973 Viva Terlingua album at the Luckenbach dance hall. In 1977, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson recorded their hit Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love). Additionally, the National Museum of the Pacific War has become a big draw to military history buffs. Fredericksburg has become attractive to retirees and people looking to relocate to a simpler way of life. Real estate became a prime business as prices rose. The city has become a weekend destination for people in Central Texas, specifically those from Austin and San Antonio. Fredericksburg in the 21st century is in a state of flux. As each generation of descendants of the original settlers dies away, or moves to new horizons, the authenticity of the rural German farm culture of the Texas Hill Country communities also dies away. It is gradually blending with the customs of newcomers and being replaced by tourist-oriented concepts of both German heritage and the Texas cowboy culture. In 1934, the Gillespie County Historical Society was formed and now houses over 300,000 artifacts. Along with like-minded individuals and organizations, the historical society is dedicated to preserving artifacts, architecture, and the history of Fredericksburg.

It was created in December 1939, and first saw combat in the Battle of France, and was then posted to security duties. From December 1941, the division was shifted to the southern sector of the Eastern Front, where it fought until February 1944 when it was encircled near Cherkassy and virtually destroyed.  Organisation  The 88th Infantry Division was a unit of the 6th wave of army mobilisation. Due to the rapid expansion of the Army at the declaration of war, there was not enough German equipment available to meet demand, and the divisions of the 6th wave were issued with weapons and equipment of Czech origin. Upon formation, the division had the following sub units: * Grenadier-Regiment 245 * Grenadier-Regiment 246 * Grenadier-Regiment 248 * Artillery-Regiment 188 * Anti-tank Battalion 188 * Bicycle-Squadron 188 * Pionier Battalion 188 * Signals Battalion 188 * Divisional Services 188 In November 1943 the division was restructured. One of its regiments, the 248, was disbanded entirely, and the remnants of the (also disbanded) 323 ID was incorporated to replace it. This was called the 323 division group of regimental size and the 591 and 593 as battalion sized 'regimental groups'. This is an expedient that was used in the creation of the Korps abteilung. The other battalions of the division were reshuffled, to leave two regiments of two battalions each and a divisional fusilier battalion. This left the 88th division with seven infantry battalions in line with the Type 44 division organisation and structure.see Nafziger, Infantry in WWII p 138  Operational history  By May 1940 the division was deemed ready for combat, transferred to the western front and subsequently took part in the battle for France. Soon after the battle, the division was sent back to southern Germany for further training, and some of its personnel were allowed to return to their peacetime professions in industry and agriculture. In the winter of 1941 the division was posted to the Soviet Union, and took part in the winter defensive battles of Army Group South, in line between Belgorod and Kursk.  Kharkov 1942  In May 1942, the Soviets launched a new offensive effort aimed at retaking Kharkov in a pincer move.See Second Battle of Kharkov. The southern group attacked from the great bulge in the line west of Izsum, backed up by two of the newly created Tank Corps (23rd & 21st) and 6th Cavalry Corps and the northern grouping attacked on a more direct line using the 38th, 21st and 28th Armies backed up by 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps.Kharkov 1942, see map page 45 The northern group attack began on 13 May with some limited successes. German reaction was swift: using infantry and 3rd and 23rd Panzer divisions, part of the forces gathered for the summer offensive, they hit the northern attack with repeated counterattacks, whilst blocking advancement in the south. As part of these efforts, a two-regimental group from 88th infantry division (Combat Group Gollwitzer) was shifted to the area and joined in these attacks from the northern flank.Kharkov 1942, page 194 With their attack obviously going nowhere, the Russians abandoned the attack and had withdrawn their offensive groupings by 24 May 1942. Following this action, the 88th Division then took part in the opening stages of Plan Blue, the German summer offensive. After only a short advance, the division was again put on the defensive on the northern flank of the 9th Army, where it remained for several months. In January 1943, after the Stalingrad debacle, Russian offensives rippled along the front. The 9th Army front was breached and it was forced to retreat, the 88th Division with it. After the front was finally stabilised for the Germans by Erich von Manstein counter stroke at Karkov, the 88th division was again in defensive positions, this time along the Minus river, whilst dramatic events unfolded around the Kursk salient. The failure of the German offensive preceded the start of a prolonged period of Soviet attacks, and by September, von Manstein was no longer confident that the forces of AGS could defeat them without substantial reinforcement. Hitler thereafter authorised the withdrawal to the Panther line on 15 September. A race to the Dnieper followed: both German and Soviet forces raced to reach the river first, with the German forces attempting to fully man defensive fortifications ahead of the arrival of the bulk of the Soviet forces. The 88th pulled back and crossed the river Dneiper as part of VII Armycorps, and was inserted into the new defensive line on the western bank. The German forces were unable to prevent the Red Army from seizing several bridgeheads across the river.  Poland  88\\\\. ID shown in the northern sector during the German breakout attempt After the break out from Cherkassy, the division was quickly rebuilt, and by June 1944 was back in line under the 4th Panzer Army, Army Group North Ukraine. In mid-July, Soviet 1st Ukrainian Front started a series of offensives and the German forces were driven back into southern Poland. This was a time of constant retreat for the 88th division as the front was pulled back time after time, but after considerable effort the Germans finally managed to stabilize the front by September.See maps Battle for L'vov pages 181-216 Although the 88th avoided encirclement in these battles, it suffered considerable casualties and was down to a 'Kampfgruppe'Russo German war Summer 44, order of battle, pages 63 & 64 by mid August. The decimated 88th division was to remain static for over 3 months. It finally met its fate in January 1945, when Soviet armies were unleashed with overwhelming odds and much of Army Group A, of which the 88th division was now a part, was overwhelmed and destroyed. This was the last action of the division; its remnants were listed as fighting with battle group Jauer at the end of January.See order of battle Army Group Centre 31st Jan 1945, page 54, Russia German war No 35.

The second film directed by, written by, and starring Josh Radnor, it tells the story of 35-year-old Jesse (Radnor) who has a romantic relationship with Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen), a 19-year-old college student. The film premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival in January 2012. Plot Jesse Fisher (Radnor) is a 35-year-old college admissions officer in New York City who loves literature and language, but is newly single and dissatisfied with his life and career. He believes that the happiest time of his life was the years at his unnamed Ohio liberal arts college, where he could study uninterrupted, surrounded by others like him. Peter Hoberg (Jenkins), his former English professor, invites Jesse back to the college to attend Peter's retirement ceremony. Jesse meets 19-year-old Zibby (Olsen), a sophomore studying drama and the daughter of Peter's friends. After the retirement dinner, Jesse stumbles upon a dorm party where he runs into Zibby. They agree to have coffee together the next day. He spends the afternoon with Zibby and they walk around the campus discussing life, books, and music. He also encounters his old romantics teacher, Judith Fairfield (Janney)--a woman he has long admired--and meets the eccentric Nat (Efron), and Dean (Magaro), a brilliant but depressed student who, like Jesse, always carries a book with him.According to Radnor , the book Dean carries is David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. Before Jesse leaves, Zibby asks to stay in touch; they become pen pals and become closer via handwritten letters. Meanwhile, Peter feels lost ahead of his upcoming retirement, and goes to the dean to ask to stay on. The dean replies that the faculty have already hired his replacement. Zibby invites Jesse back to campus, hinting that she has feelings for him. Jesse has concerns about the 16-year age gap, but agrees. They spend time together and kiss. When Peter sees them together, however, he warns Jesse about living in the past. Zibby confesses her feelings to Jesse and asks him to sleep with her; he agrees, but changes his mind after she admits that she is a virgin. Zibby is insulted and hurt and asks him to leave. Jesse goes to a bar where he meets Fairfield again. They have a one-night stand, but afterwards she tells him to grow up and kicks him out. Meanwhile, Zibby goes to a party and kisses a classmate. Jesse leaves without seeing Zibby again, but says goodbye to Peter. Jesse returns to New York and, some months later, writes to Zibby again. He apologizes for hurting her, says that he misses her and credits her for helping him to grow. He meets and starts dating Ana (Reaser), a bookseller his own age with a similar love for books. After Jesse helps avert Dean's suicide by overdose, he advises the young man to stop hiding from life within books. Jesse goes to see Zibby and apologizes to her again. She says that she had hoped to take a shortcut to adulthood through a relationship with Jesse, and that she understands that what he did was the right thing. Jesse goes back home and renews his correspondence with Zibby. The film ends with Zibby lying down reading Songs of Innocence and of Experience which she received via courier from Jesse, and Ana lying on Jesse's chest, them happily talking about growing old.

Reception Liberal Arts received generally positive reviews and has a rating of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 113 reviews with an average score of 6.56 out of 10. The consensus states: \\"While it's hard not to wish it had a little more bite, Liberal Arts ultimately succeeds as a good-natured -- and surprisingly clever -- look at the addictive pull of nostalgia for our youth.\\" The film also has a score of 55 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 reviews, indicating \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 and a half out of 4 stars and stated in his review: : \\"Liberal Arts is an almost unreasonable pleasure about a jaded New Yorker who returns to his alma mater in Ohio and finds that his heart would like to stay there. It's the kind of film that appeals powerfully to me; to others, maybe not so much. : There is a part of me that will forever want to be walking under autumn leaves, carrying a briefcase containing the works of Shakespeare and Yeats and a portable chess set. I will pass an old tree under which once on a summer night I lay on the grass with a fragrant young woman and we quoted e.e. cummings back and forth. There is a word to explain why this particular film so appealed to me.

As a child, she studied under Catholic nuns. Because she suffered from polio, she initially wanted to be a pianist. However, due to her father's disapproval, she studied law at the University of Indonesia, receiving a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1975. Studying under Hamid Attamimi, the \\"founder of the Indonesian Constitution Science\\", she decided to stay in law. Farida received her notary public's degree in 1982. She later received a Master of Laws degree from the same institution in 1997, finishing her doctorate studies in 2002. She has also taken non-formal courses on law making in Leiden, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Boston, and San Francisco. Farida initially worked to draft legislation. She first served as a justice of the Constitutional Court after she was requested to do so by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2008; she had previously been asked by eight different women's rights organisations, but had refused. She is the nine-member court's first, as of 2010 only, female justice. During the constitutional court's appraisal of the Bill against Pornography and Pornoaction, she headed the three member specialty panel. Of the three, she was the only one to question its necessity, saying that the law was \\"open to too many interpretations, the definition of pornography [too] ambiguous, ... divisive and bound to be difficult to implement,\\" and noting that traditional dances like Jaipongan could fall under its definition. She has also dissented in cases regarding blasphemy law and a quota for legislative seats for women. She was initially expected to serve until 2013.

They are unique to a specialized form of waterfowl hunting called Layout hunting. Most layout boats are used for diver duck or ocean duck hunting where open deep water waterfowl species frequent. Sometimes they are deployed in marshes for more traditional puddle duck hunting or goose hunting. Layout boats come in designs such as pumpkin seed, oval, box like just to name a few. They come in one- and two-man models. These boats are painted to match the color of the water and sit very low in the water. The main focus of the layout boat is to put the hunter very close to the decoys if not in them for additional concealment. This makes for very dramatic hunting scenarios where a decoying bird comes extremely close to the hunter and boat. They are used to target diver ducks such as bluebills (greater scaup), canvasback, goldeneye, scoters and eider to name a few. This is because divers often fly low on the water and will not notice the low sides of the boat. Layout boats are often placed within the decoy spread, so the decoys help further conceal the sides of the boat. References *Sternberg, Dick - Simpson,Jeff (1997).

McCarty (June 7, 1798 ‚Äì May 10, 1881) was the first missionary Episcopal priest in the Washington Territory. He served as the only United States Army chaplain at the front during the Mexican War. He was instrumental in founding and establishing numerous Episcopal churches in Western New York and the Northwest. Early years McCarty was born on June 7, 1798, in Rhinebeck, New York. As a young man, he studied law and briefly practiced for three years. He then decided to enter the ordained ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church. On Mar. 3, 1825, McCarty joined the United States Navy as an acting chaplain, shipping out on the U.S.S. Constitution which was participating in an anti-piracy campaign as a part of the Mediterranean Squadron. McCarty was ordained deacon on Dec. 23, 1825. He left the Navy on Apr. 21, 1826. On Oct. 26, 1827 he was ordained a priest in the Protestant Episcopal Church by Bishop John H. Hobart. He began his work as a missionary in Oswego County, New York, where he remained until 1845. During his time in Oswego County, Reverend McCarty was active in missionary work, visiting and providing services in many towns and villages, and founding and building a number of Episcopal churches. On May 28, 1828, he laid the cornerstone of Christ Church (Protestant Episcopal), Oswego, New York. On June 22, 1835, he organized Zion Church (Protestant Episcopal) in Fulton, New York, and laid the cornerstone of its new building on August 6, 1836. Reverend McCarty was rector at both of these churches, living at the rectory at Christ Church. Mexican American War chaplain When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in 1846, McCarty resigned as rector of Christ Church and at the age of 48 enlisted in the United States Army, as a brigade chaplain for the Second Brigade, First Division. Chaplain McCarty was the only brigade chaplain in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and the only official chaplain to be stationed at the front in Mexico. He was known as a chaplain who was deeply involved with the troops, not hesitating to go into battle with them. During one battalion march across corn fields and ditches, Chaplain McCarty was the first to start tearing down growing corn stalks and throwing them in ditches to make the effort safer and faster for the troops. During the Battle of Churubusco, August 20, 1847, Chaplain McCarty distinguished himself by ignoring the heavy fire, in order to console the wounded and encouraging the other men to go on fighting. McCarty didn't agree with war, but as a chaplain he insisted that ‚Äúwhen duty called, personal earnestness and bravery should be manifested in the chaplain as well as in the officers of the line‚Äù. Chaplain McCarty thus insisted on going with the fighting troops into battle. The troops called him ‚Äúthe fighting parson‚Äù. When they were fording a stream he was quoted as saying ‚ÄúBoys, this is an unholy war, but be careful to keep your powder boxes up and not get your powder wet.‚Äù Major General Winfield Scott, commander of the U.S. Army in Mexico, called McCarty one of the bravest men in the Army. Along with General Scott, Chaplain McCarty was one of only two honorary members of the Aztec Club of 1847. After the Mexican War, Chaplain McCarty was stationed at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, from 1848 until 1852. Northwest Missionary Priest The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church appointed Reverend McCarty a missionary in 1852. He was sent to be the rector of Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland, OR (which is now Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (Portland, Oregon)). He reached Portland, Oregon, traveling by ship and passing through Panama, on Jan. 19, 1853, to begin his ministry. At this time, this was the Oregon Territory, with the separation into Oregon and Washington occurring on February 8, 1853. Soldiers across the Columbia River at the U.S. Army Fort Vancouver knew Reverend McCarty from his service as a brigade chaplain in the Mexican War. So they asked him to also minister to them at their station. Reverend McCarty would spend part of the week at Trinity Church, then on Sunday afternoon cross the river. He would then minister to both the Hudson's Bay Company Fort Vancouver and the adjacent U.S. Army Fort Vancouver, and also at the village of Vancouver. In several stories about Reverend McCarty's missionary travels in the northwest, repeated by bishops, writers, and in his own letters, it illustrated his willingness to endure hardship, long travels on foot, and sometimes severe weather. To get from Portland, Oregon to Vancouver, Washington each week, Reverend McCarty needed to use three ferries and walk over twenty miles through the wilderness. Sometimes the ferries that crossed smaller waterways (called sloughs locally) didn't run, so McCarty would have to wade through the cold waters to continue his journey. On trips to northern Washington, he was sometimes forced to sleep in burnt out logs to get out of snowstorms. His missionary trips took him to all parts of Oregon and Washington, mostly on foot or by boat on inland streams and rivers. He was in his mid-fifties at this time. To provide some insight to the conditions of the day, the following is an excerpt from a report Reverend McCarty made to the Missionary Society in 1853: > ‚ÄúMay 16th I set out on an extensive tour of exploration and Missionary duty > into the new Territory of Washington, which is separated from Oregon by the > Columbia River. I went by steamboat down this river to the mouth of the > Cowlitz River up the same against a strong current; in an Indian canoe, > about thirty-three miles to Cowlitz Landing then on horseback to Steilacoom, > a military post on the east side of Puget Sound.‚Äù Later in the report he > indicated providing services over the next days to those in the village of > Olympia, Cowlitz Landing, Fort Nisqually, and Monticello. At the end of the > report he summarizes ‚ÄúTaking a steamer up the Columbia, I reached Portland > the 2nd of June, after an absence of fourteen days, having traveled three > hundred and twenty-five miles. Of these, ninety was by steamer, sixty-eight > by canoe, and one hundred and sixty-seven on horseback. The roads for a part > of the distance were barely passable. During the tour I officiated six times > in five places, in all of which, I believe, the service of our Church had > never before been performed.‚Äù As was typical of the times, it is likely he travelled at a great discount or free, borrowed transportation, and was guided by interested persons or those traders going in the same direction. In 1854, McCarty was transferred by the U.S. Army to Fort Steilacoom, Washington Territory. In addition to his chaplaincy at Fort Steilacoom, McCarty also conducted services in Steilacoom, in Olympia, Washington at the House of Representatives, which later formed into St. John's Episcopal Church (Olympia, Washington), and a number of other locations throughout northern Washington. On July 14, 1855, the Reverend John McCarty, the only Episcopal clergy in the Washington Territory, conducted services in Seattle's small frame Methodist church. This was the first recorded Episcopal service held in pioneer Seattle.cite web url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/fe4adad5-dbbb-4599-b23e-9f5cd9c9fe99 title=Trinity Parish Church accessdate=August 6, 2019 Creating family ties In late 1855, McCarty took an extended leave to travel back East. He returned in April, 1856 with a wife, the widow Lussanah, and her children who he had adopted. Initially they went to Fort Steilacoom, but then transferred back to Fort Vancouver in 1857. In addition to his chaplaincy duties at the fort, Reverend McCarty conducted Episcopal services in a converted schoolhouse within the city of Vancouver, Washington. This is the beginning of St. Luke's Episcopal Church. Reverend McCarty settled down in Vancouver, retaining his chaplaincy in the U.S. Army at Fort Vancouver, and helping to build St. Luke's. The chaplaincy however required that Reverend McCarty minister to the troops in the field also. In 1859 Reverend McCarty traveled through territory recently involved in the Indian wars into Eastern Washington, to Fort Walla Walla, conducting the first Episcopal services there. He also conducted services in the surrounding community, as well as ministered in the field to those wounded and killed as a part of the various Indian wars occurring during this time. On May 27, 1860, he arranged for St. Luke's to be the first Episcopal church in the Washington Territory to be consecrated, by then Bishop Thomas F. Scott. Joseph M. Fletcher, a prominent local attorney, was elected the church's Sr. Warden at that time. A number of local civic leaders, including Louis Sohns, Henry C. Hodges, and John McNeil Eddings joined and became part of the church leadership. The church building was a converted schoolhouse located at East Fifth and West Reserve, outside of Fort Vancouver in Vancouver, Washington. Reverend McCarty continued to build the parish at St. Luke's, serving as its first rector. Reverend McCarty's oldest daughter, Mary McCarty, was married to James Crawford, a prominent local businessman and a vestry member of St. Luke's. Crawford was the partner of Charles W. Slocum, in the firm of Crawford & Slocum Co., which had business dealings in many parts of the Pacific Northwest. Retirement On September 16, 1867 Reverend McCarty was retired by the U.S. Army as a chaplain. On April 8, 1868, he resigned as rector at St. Luke's, and he and his wife Lussanah moved East to Washington, D.C. to live with their son. In 1873, the McCarty's returned to Vancouver to participate in the dedication of a new church building for St. Luke's, built in the previous year. The Reverend and Mrs. McCarty remained in Vancouver for another two years, with Reverend McCarty assisting his successor at St. Luke's, Reverend Albert S. Nicholson. In 1875, the McCarty's returned to Washington, D.C. On January 22, 1879, Lussanah McCarty died in Washington, D.C. On May 10, 1881 Reverend John D. McCarty died in Washington, D.C. His funeral at St. Mark's Church at Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C. was attended by many of the soldiers (some of which had become generals) he had served with in Mexico and Vancouver. He was buried at Rock Creek Cemetery outside of the city. Character Rev. McCarty was regarded highly by many persons, which gives some indication of his character. Captain Edward D. Townsend, who considered McCarty a celebrity, wrote that he had the pleasure of hearing him preach in November, 1855 in a room fitted up as a theatre at the Vancouver Barracks. Townsend, later the army's adjutant general, was destined to be pallbearer at McCarty's funeral. Joseph M. Fletcher is quoted as saying, \\"If a stranger arrived in town Dr. McCarty would find him out and speak words of welcome and cheer. McCarty could be found soothing the sick and helping the distressed, and that too without show or parade.\\" References Category:1798 births Category:1881 deaths Category:People from Rhinebeck, New York Category:American Anglican missionaries Category:United States Army chaplains Category:United States Navy chaplains Category:People from Vancouver, Washington Category:Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War chaplains Category:People from Oswego County, New York Category:Anglican missionaries in the United States Category:American expatriates in Mexico ","title":"John D.

LCs are normally cleared by the kidneys, but in LCDD, these light chain deposits damage organs and cause disease. The kidneys are almost always affected and this often leads to kidney failure. About half of people with light chain deposition disease also have a plasma cell dyscrasia, a spectrum of diseases that includes multiple myeloma, Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, and the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance premalignant stages of these two diseases. Unlike in AL amyloidosis, in which light chains are laid down in characteristic amyloid deposits, in LCDD, light chains are deposited in non- amyloid granules. Signs and symptoms The kidney is the organ most frequently affected. Proteinuria, the presence of protein in the urine, is characteristic. More than 90% of people with LCDD develop kidney failure, often with rapid progression of disease. Light chains may be deposited in many other organs and may or may not result in any symptoms. Other than the kidneys, liver and heart are the most commonly involved organs. Deposition of light chains in the liver may lead to hepatomegaly, an enlarged liver, or rarely portal hypertension or liver failure. The heart is affected in up to 80% of patients with LCDD, and may cause arrhythmias and congestive heart failure. Diagnosis A number of laboratory tests are required in order to assist in diagnosing LCDD. Blood and urine samples are collected for evaluation of kidney and liver function and determination of the presence of a monoclonal protein. Imaging studies such as echocardiography and an ultrasound of the abdomen will be performed. A CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) may also be indicated.In patients with LCDD, a biopsy of the affected organ will show deposited light chains. A bone marrow biopsy will be done in order to rule out multiple myeloma. Treatment Decreasing production of the organ-damaging light chains is the treatment goal. Options include chemotherapy using bortezomib, autologous stem cell transplantation, immunomodulatory drugs, and kidney transplant. There is no standard treatment for LCDD. High-dose melphalan in conjunction with autologous stem cell transplantation has been used in some patients. A regimen of bortezomib and dexamethasone has also been examined. Prognosis The median time to progression to end stage renal disease is 2.7 years. After 5 years, about 37% of patients with LCDD are alive and do not have end stage renal disease.

The invention had not been constructed by the inventor because of the significant cost of doing so. The Commissioner of Patents refused the patent application on the ground that the death ray was \\"inoperable for the purpose for which it was designed.\\" Decision Chief Justice Thurlow, for the Court, found that the patent did not disclose how a technical challenge would be addressed and was not written clearly enough to enable a person skilled in the art to make or use the invention.

An army of up to 3,000 Patriot militia under Colonel Richard Richardson marched against Loyalist recruiting centers in South Carolina, flushing them out and frustrating attempts by the Loyalists to organize. The Patriot expedition became known as the Snow Campaign due to heavy snowfall in the later stages of the campaign. Background When the American Revolutionary War began in Massachusetts in April 1775, the free population of the Province of South Carolina was divided in its reaction.Alden, pp. 199‚Äì200 Many English coastal residents were either neutral or favored the rebellion, while significant numbers of backcountry residents, many of whom were German and Scottish immigrants, were opposed.Alden, pp. 7, 9, 199‚Äì200 Loyalist opposition in the backcountry was dominated by Thomas Fletchall, a vocal and active opponent of attempts to resist King and Parliament.Krawczynski, p. 156Alden, p. 200 By August 1775 tensions between Patriot and Loyalist in the province had escalated to the point where both sides had raised sizable militia forces.Cann, p. 204 Events were largely nonviolent for some time, although there were isolated instances of tarring and feathering, but tensions were high as the sides struggled for control of munitions. The Patriot Council of Safety in early August sent William Henry Drayton and Reverend William Tennent to Ninety Six to rally Patriot support and suppress growing Loyalist activities in the backcountry.Dunkerly and Williams, p. 21 Drayton was able to negotiate a tenuous treaty with Fletchall in September that only temporarily lessened tensions.Krawczynski, pp. 186‚Äì189 On September 15, Patriot militia seized Fort Johnson, the principal fortification overlooking the Charleston harbor. Governor William Campbell dissolved the provincial assembly, and fearing for his personal safety, fled to the Royal Navy sloop of war . This left the Council of Safety in control of the provincial capital.McCrady, pp. 68‚Äì69 The council began improving and expanding Charleston's coastal defenses, and there was a bloodless exchange of cannon fire between Patriot-controlled positions and Royal Navy ships in the harbor on November 11 and 12.McCrady, p. 77 Matters also escalated when the Council of Safety began to organize a large- scale response to the seizure by Loyalists in October of a shipment of gunpowder and ammunition intended for the Cherokee.Cann, p. 207 On November 8 the Council of Safety voted to send Colonel Richard Richardson, the commander of the Camden militia, to recover the shipment and arrest opposition leaders.Cann, p. 212  Siege at Ninety Six  While Richardson gathered forces in Charleston, Major Andrew Williamson, who had been recruiting Patriots in the backcountry, learned of the gunpowder seizure. He arrived at Ninety Six early on November 19 with 560 men. Finding the small town to be not very defensible, he established a camp on John Savage's plantation, which was protected by an improvised stockade and provided a field of fire for the force's three swivel guns.Cann, p. 209 Loyalist recruiting had been more successful: Williamson had learned that Captain Patrick Cuningham and Major Joseph Robinson were leading a large Loyalist force (estimated to number about 1,900) toward Ninety Six.McCrady, p. 89Dunkerly and Williams, p. 22 In a war council that day, the Patriot leaders decided against marching out to face the Loyalists. The Loyalists arrived the next day, and surrounded the Patriot camp.McCrady, pp. 89‚Äì90 The leaders of the two factions were in the midst of negotiating an end to the standoff when two Patriot militiamen were seized by Loyalists outside the stockade. This set off a gunfight that lasted for about two hours, with modest casualties on both sides. For two more days the Patriots were besieged, during which there were occasional exchanges of gunfire. The siege ended after a parley in which the Patriot leaders were allowed to lead their forces out of the encampment in exchange for the surrender of their swivel guns, which were later returned. Both sides withdrew, the Loyalists across the Saluda River, and the Patriots down toward Charleston.Cann, pp. 210‚Äì213  Campaign against Loyalists  Colonel Richardson had in the meantime begun his march into the backcountry. By November 27 he reached the Congaree River with about 1,000 men. There he paused for several days, crossing the river and accumulating more militia companies into his force. When he left camp his force numbered about 1,500.Landrum, p. 73 By December 2 he had reached the Dutch Fork region (between the Saluda and Broad Rivers), gathering an ever-increasing number of militia along the way. There he halted at Evan McLauren's house, capturing several Loyalist officers in the area. The Loyalist forces, hampered by loss of leadership, were shrinking due to desertion. Those that remained organized retreated toward Cherokee lands at the headwaters of the Saluda River. After issuing proclamations calling for the arrest of Loyalist officers and the return of the stolen munitions, Richardson resumed the march, his force grown to about 2,500. His force, still growing in size, marched toward the Enoree River, chasing down Loyalist leaders. On December 12 Richardson reported that his force numbered 3,000, and that he had captured Fletchall (who was found hiding in a cave) and several other Loyalist leaders.McCrady, p. 96 Fletchall's farm was searched and his private correspondence, including letters from Governor Campbell, were found.Landrum, p. 77 At the Enoree Richardson was joined by militia forces under Williamson, as well as additional militia from North Carolina led by Colonels Griffith Rutherford and William Graham, swelling his force until it numbered between four and five thousand.McCrady, p. 97 These forces scoured the backcountry, and located a camp of 200 Loyalists on the Reedy River, several miles inside Cherokee territory.Landrum, pp. 79‚Äì80 Richardson sent William Thomson with 1,300 troops to attack the camp. Thomson and the volunteers surprised the Loyalist camp on December 22, taking prisoners and seizing supplies, weapons, and ammunition. Following the Battle of Great Cane Brake, Thomson was able to control his men and avoid a slaughter: only five or six Loyalists were killed, and one of Thomson's men was wounded. The next day, December 23, it began snowing as the Patriot forces made their way back toward the coast. The march home of the Patriot force was difficult because the force was unprepared for the weather. Richardson's army was dissolved, and most of the Patriots returned home.Landrum, pp. 80‚Äì81 Richardson took 136 prisoners, who were dispatched to Charleston under guard on January 2, 1776.Cann, p. 213 Aftermath 19th century depiction of the Battle of Sullivan's Island Governor Campbell continued to live aboard the Tamar, and considered making attacks on Fort Johnson after a third warship arrived.McCrady, p. 98 Patriot forces, however, were active in building up the harbor's defenses, and the British fleet left Charleston in January 1776.McCrady, pp. 99‚Äì102 British forces led by Sir Henry Clinton made an unsuccessful attack on Charleston in June 1776; it was the last major British operation in the south until late 1778.Wilson, p. 56 The campaign resulted in the elimination of large-scale Loyalist activity in the backcountry. Most of the prisoners taken were released by the Patriot leadership \\"as a conciliatory gesture to their backcountry friends\\". Some Loyalist leaders managed to escape capture. Notable among them was Thomas Brown, a South Carolina landowner who fled to East Florida. He was a leading force in the guerrilla war on the Georgia-Florida border, and his plans for retaking Georgia and eventually South Carolina were implemented by the British between 1778 and 1780.Cann, pp. 213‚Äì214Cashin, p. 73 Notes  References   * Category:Conflicts in 1775 Category:Battles of the American Revolutionary War in South Carolina Category:Battles involving Great Britain Category:Battles involving the United States Category:1775 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:Tarring and feathering in the United States Category:Battles in the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War 1775‚Äì1779 ","title":"Snow Campaign"},{"id":"33919080","text":"Days is the second studio album by American indie rock band Real Estate, released on October 18, 2011 on Domino Records.

Background  As early as the 1920s and 1930s, the All- Union Communist Party Congress discussed solutions to dealing with the pan- movements‚Äîincluding pan-Arabism, pan-Islamism and pan-Turkism. The Soviet Union saw all of the pan-movements as a problem. Islam was seen in a negative light as the Soviets saw all other religions, but a tactical approach had to be taken with Islam due to the relationship that was to develop between the Middle East and the Soviet Union. While there was a string of Soviet anti- Islamic propaganda, there was also an attempt at understanding Islam on an ideological level. Pan-Arabism was the least important of the movements during the period, but it had the most potential for growth and support in the future. This understanding would help the Soviets to realize the need to support the pan-Arab movement, especially when it came to developing relations with Egypt and Palestine. The Soviet Union began to develop interest in the Middle East in the early-1950s, intensifying after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953. Evidence points to the fact that the Soviet Union developed an interest in the Middle East because of American efforts forge alliances within the region. The prestige in which the Soviet's gained the title as protectors against Western imperialism happened during the period of the Suez Canal Crisis. Many nations in the Middle East strengthened their diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union. There were several reasons that developing pro-Arab propaganda was important for the Soviet Union and creating an Arab alliance, including: * The weakness that could develop if the United States had strong alliances in the Middle East, especially in the Northern Tier (Afghanistan and Pakistan). * To further demonize the United States and Israel as well as to create a split between all imperialist countries with Middle Eastern countries (especially Egypt). * To spread communist ideals into other regions of the world.  Propaganda operations   Palestinian Liberation Organization  Pro-Palestine propaganda was produced by the Soviets through print journalism and radio. A campaign began in 1968 in the media for a partisan struggle against the occupier (Israel). The Soviet Union discreetly showed that they were in support of violence, providing justification for future violence by the organization. For example, the Radio Moscow broadcast in Arabic following the Six-Day War stated that \\"the 'resistance movement had become a part of the general struggle of the Arab people against the Israeli aggression' and that it was therefore 'natural' that the Palestinian refugees should carry arms to defend their rights usurped by the aggressors\\". At this point, the Soviet Union was cautious of their support of the organization, but it was clear that they were justifying the terrorist action that they supposedly openly oppose. This Radio Moscow broadcast laid out the groundwork for the future campaign to present the Palestinian people as oppressed and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as a legitimate government with no country. As violence by the PLO became more consistent throughout the early 1970s, the Soviets put up a cloak of denial. There was minimal coverage in their newspapers about the PLO terrorist attacks. When they did comment, it was directed away from Palestine. In 1974, the PLO laid an attack on Israel, killing 18 Israelis. The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) blamed the attack on Israeli Arabs‚Äîthis gave the attack legitimacy, presenting a partisan resistance and placing the blame on unknown persons or on Israel itself. This was a pattern that was developing with Radio Moscow, consistent patterns of denial and deception in the case of terrorism in the Middle East, specifically relating to the PLO. Much of the propaganda was pushed through Radio Moscow, but there were some instances where Pravda provided written propaganda and visual aid.  Israel as the aggressor against Palestine  The overt methods of propaganda and the support the Soviets gathered through the United Nations were meant to isolate the United States and Israel. There were several reports of the United States providing Israel with napalm, cluster bombs and ball bearing bombs, showing that the United States was allowing for Israel to push people out of Lebanon and Palestine. The TASS went on to explain that the blame should not only be placed upon Israel for the violence that ensued, but the United States as well. Without the support of Washington \\"Israel would not have dared to commit such atrocities\\". The Soviet Union was painting a picture of violent aggressor (those being the United States and Israel) whilst presenting the Palestinian people as a unified group of oppressed people. This was presented in a package‚Äîradio and print, with visual aids as support. Any visual presentations of pro-Palestinian propaganda reinforced the fact that Israel was viewed as the aggressor and Palestine as the innocence. In the summer of 1967, the Soviet Union's unconditional support of the Arab cause resulted in a frenzied anti-Israeli campaign which made abundant use of traditional antisemitic stereotypes, particularly in cartoons that usually accompanied articles in Soviet newspapers and magazines. This anti-Israeli campaign that was waged starting in the 1960s was meant as an extension of the pro-Arab propaganda, using this as a means to not only bring up their allies, but to demonize the enemy as well.  Egypt  In the 1940s and 1950s, it was important to convey a vision of pro-Arab/anti-imperialist propaganda. The Soviets realized the way to build a relationship with the Egyptians was to demonize the British. It is also important to note that pan-Arab nationalism was building during this period under Gamal Nasser. The Soviet Union began information warfare in Egypt. In 1945, propaganda was covertly communist with the pro-Arab appeal. Print and oral media was focused on pushing out the British for the good of the Arab nation. The Soviets had their own radio station in Egyptian dialect to broadcast to the people. They also were approved for their own newspaper. Although Soviet propaganda spread throughout Egypt, the Egyptians never really became close with the Soviets. There was a sense of Soviet hospitality towards Egyptians, but \\"they seem to be afraid of getting into close contact with the Soviets\\". This could be due to the fact that Soviet propaganda was more pro-communism than pro-Arab in their information warfare during a period of growth for the pan-Arab movement.  United States counter measures  The Middle East was a strategic location for the United States to claim allies. This location being the underbelly of the Soviet Union, the weak spot. It was because of this that the United States and the Soviet Union were constantly at battle for support in the Middle East region. There was also importance in maintain ties with Arab nations to ensure the lastly existence of Israel as well as to hold onto the flow of oil from the Middle East to the United States. Throughout the Cold War, the United States found ways to combat communism and the Soviet Union, but it was during the 1950s that the United States became very active in propaganda as a tool. The purpose of American propaganda was to control and prevent the spread of communism as well as to warn of its dangers. In addition, American propaganda was meant to create a \\"reversal of anti-American trends of Arab opinion\\". Some the means in which the United States exerted its influence in the Middle East was through pamphlets and brochures, newspapers and media as well as through exchange programs and other cultural exchanges.  Pamphlets, brochures and posters  In Iraq, there was a lack of radio access, minimal communist films and an unsympathetic press. This left the United States with the option of producing pamphlets. They targeted the educated and semi-educated masses that find themselves in the urban middle class. In Iran, the United States created Iranian government sponsored posters that were to be displayed in urban and rural schools.  Newspapers and other media  Efforts were made to produce information for the press that gave the United States a sense of neutrality in the Palestinian issue. There was also a campaign with the Arab press to help them to focus on their own problems and move away from outside influences, all while maintaining a relationship with the United States. In Iraq, there was an effort to \\"change the general prevailing public attitude in Iraq which is either unaware or apathetic toward the dangers of Soviet imperialism\\". This was an effort made through press for print media. There was also an instance in the 1950s that the United States government considered the idea of having Walt Disney develop an anti-communist film with characters that looked like Mickey Mouse, Pluto, Goofy and so forth. This was used as an effort to reach the masses, and enhance the reception of the information.  Cultural influence  Cultural influence was a way for the United States to shape opinion that was anti-communist and pro-Western through literary, educational and personal means. This was a means to reach the masses on a more personal level, a way to allow Arab persons to feel connected with the United States. An example of this can be seen in the fact that new reading rooms were built in Arab universities, with books favorable to the United States.

It was circumscribed by Paul F. Cannon in 1994 for a group of grass-associated fungi centered on Magnaporthe (Nakataea). Magnaporthaceae have a harpophora-like asexual morphology and are often associated with roots of grasses or cereals. Important pathogens from the Magnaporthaceae include Nakataea oryzae, Gaeumannomyces graminis, Magnaporthiopsis poae and Magnaporthe rhizophila.  Taxonomy and Systematics  Type genus: Nakataea Hara (= Magnaporthe R.A. Krause & R.K. Webster) Type species: Nakataea oryzae (Catt.) J. Luo & N. Zhang  Description  Magnaporthaceae that reproduce sexually, have perithecial ascomata that are immersed in host tissue, frequently with long necks. Asci are cylindrical and stain positive in Meltzer's reagent. Ascospores are curved to sigmoid and contain septa. They show variability in their morphology and can be filiform (Gaeumannomyces) or fusiform (Nakataea = Magnaporthe). The colour of ascospores is hyaline to olivaceous. Asexual morphs have hyaline to pale brown conidia, which are septate to aseptate, straight or curved and variable in shape.  Higher order systematics  Magnaporthaceae used to be the only family within the order Magnaporthales, which are closely related to the orders Diaporthales and Ophiostomatales. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three clear clades could be distinguished within the Magnaporthales. The Magnaporthaceae are sister to Pyriculariaceae, and Ophioceraceae.  Taxonomic history  The family Magnaporthaceae was originally described with six genera and around 20 species comprising mainly necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic plant pathogens infecting root and shoots of Poaceae and Cyperaceae. Later, endophytic or apparently saprotrophic taxa on non- gramineous hosts were also added. Based on a multilocus phylogeny it was suggested that both Magnaporthe and Gaeumannomyces are polyphyletic genera. Resolving the polyphyletic nature of Pyricularia led to the definition of the family Pyriculariaceae and separated Pyricularia species from Magnaporthe species. The rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae) is accommodated in the Pyriculariaceae, while Magnaporthe salvinii (now Nakataea oryzae) causing stem rot in rice, belongs to the Magnaporthaceae.  Differentiation from other families  Magnaporthaceae are distinguished from Pyriculariaceae by their asexual morphs. For Magnaporthaceae, the morphology of phialophora- or harpophora-like species is characterised by falcate versicoloured conidia on brown, erect conidiophores. In the case of Pyriculariaceae, Pyricularia or pyricularia-like species are characterised by pyriform 2-septate conidia and rhexolytic secession.

Presumption of validity The Court of Appeal considered the effect of the presumption of validity of a registered patent. Section 45 of the Patent Act provides that a patent granted under the Act is valid \\"in the absence of any evidence to the contrary\\". The trial judge had adopted a high standard for rebutting the presumption, where the onus to disprove the presumption is \\"not an easy one to discharge\\". D√©cary J.A., for the Court, rejected this approach. The Court of Appeal concluded that the presumption of validity merely gives rise to an evidentiary burden on a balance of probabilities. Novelty The Court of Appeal cited with approval jurisprudence that stands for the proposition that \\"an impractical and inoperable device cannot be an anticipation\\". The invention dealt with a conventional rowing machine usable in an upright position. The Court found that the prior art, which was an exercise machine, was impracticable and inoperable in the vertical position. Consequently, the patent was not anticipated. Non-obviousness The Court further determined that the invention was not obvious.

Index to Volumes 1 to 25 (1936-1969) . Annals of Science. History The journal was established after Brown visited Britain for a year and discussed where he could publish work on the history of science with Henry Robinson of the library of the Royal Society of London. They decided that aside from the Belgian Isis, there were few outlets for such work, and so founded the Annals of Science with Douglas McKie (University College London), who was the main editor. The aim was to publish faster than Isis and with a focus on the modern period. The editors chose to have a bright orange cover to make it stand out against the usual blue or grey of periodicals at the time. Around the time of World War II, only three volumes were published over a period of 12 years. From 1956‚Äì1958, the Bulletin of the British Society for the History of Science was published as part of the Annals of Science. In 1974, then editor Ivor Grattan-Guinness moved the journal from 4 to 6 issues per year; 100 issues were published from 1936‚Äì1969 and a further hundred by 1986. Grattan-Guinness also redesigned the cover and changed the tagline from \\"The History of Science and Technology since the Renaissance\\" to \\"The History of Science and Technology from the Thirteenth Century\\".Cumulative Index Volumes 26 to 43 (1970-1986) .

The organization actively promotes the human rights of people living with and vulnerable to HIV and AIDS, in Canada and internationally, through research and analysis, advocacy and litigation, public education, and community mobilization. The organization was founded in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1992, by human rights lawyers Ralf J√ºrgens, David Patterson, David Thompson, and Norman Halde. It is currently located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Issues  Unjust laws and policies and violations of human rights continue to worsen the impact of HIV and AIDS. The Legal Network's mandate focuses on ensuring that the human rights of people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS are respected, protected, and fulfilled; and that Canadian and international laws and policies facilitate HIV prevention efforts, as well as care, treatment, and support for people living with HIV and AIDS. While the Legal Network is based in Canada, their work extends around the world, wherever human rights are threatened, including the rights of LGBTQ people. Recently, the Legal Network launched a new fund, the Caribbean Can Rainbow Fund, to benefit this important work in the Caribbean. The organization's research, analysis, education, and advocacy touches on a range of issues: Aboriginal Communities, Access to Medicines, The Caribbean, Criminalization, Discrimination, Drug Policy, Immigration and Travel, Income Security, LGBTQ Rights, Prevention Technologies, Prisons, Privacy, Sex Work, Testing, Women's Rights, Russia, and Rights.  Publications  The Legal Network produces an extensive range of publications on numerous HIV-related legal and policy issues, including info sheets, Q&A; documents, briefing papers, submissions to governments and other advocacy materials, commentaries and research articles in journals, and full-length research and analytical reports. The organization has received international recognition as one of the world's foremost sources of materials on the legal and human rights aspects of HIV and AIDS. In 1994, the Legal Network began publishing the HIV/AIDS Policy & Law Review (originally the Canadian HIV/AIDS Policy & Law Newsletter), with approximately three bilingual issues published annually. In 2012 and after 18 years of publication, the Legal Network announced that it would be putting the Review on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\" due to a lack of available funds resulting from a significant federal funding cut to the organization's annual budget. The Review summarized and analyzed current developments in HIV-related policy and law, promoted education and the exchange of information, ideas, and experiences from an international perspective around human rights issues affecting the global HIV response.

He was one of the most important collectors of the works of √âdouard Manet and Paul C√©zanne at the beginning of the 20th century.Birth date from: Carl Rudolf Andersson Fredberg: Fr√•n v√•r merkantila och industriela verld: portr√§tter, autografier, biografier och skizzer fr√•n Sveriges handel, industri och handtverk, Bonnier, G√∂teborg, 1902, p. 255 ff  Life  Auguste Pellerin attained his fortune through margarine manufacturing. His successful enterprise included factories in France, England, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. From 1906 until his death in 1929 he also acted as Norwegian General Consul in Paris. At first, Pellerin collected craft objects such as porcelain, faience, and glass. He soon began to collect works by established painters such as Antoine Vollon und Jean Jacques Henner. Paintings by Jean- Baptiste-Camille Corot and the Impressionists followed. At this point he focused on √âdouard Manet, buying many major works by that artist. In 1898 he acquired his first C√©zanne from Ambroise Vollard. Over the years he accumulated a notable collection of more than 90 works by these artists. Pellerin became personally acquainted with some of these artists, including C√©zanne, who sketched his portrait in 1899. Two further portraits were painted by Henri Matisse around 1916-17. On 2 February 1910, 35 of Pellerin's Manets were sold for 1,000,000 francs to a consortium of art dealers that included Bernheim-Jeune, Durand-Ruel, and Paul Cassirer, a move that stirred controversy.Julius Meier-Graefe et al, Kunst ist nicht f√ºr Kunstgeschichte da: Briefe und Dokumente. 77 Ver√∂ffentlichung der Deutschen Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung Darmstadt, Wallstein Verlag, 2001, p. 275. Many of these paintings, which through Heinrich Thannhauser were exhibited in the Moderne Galerie in Munich, were later sold to German collectors and eventually ended up in German museums. Although Pellerin sold more of his collection during his lifetime, his son Jean-Victor Pellerin and his daughter still inherited a substantial number of paintings, drawings, and sculptures. In 1982 his heirs gave 14 of the most important C√©zanne paintings in the remaining collection to French state museums.

Scholars have identified that individuals who express verbal aggressiveness have the goal of controlling and manipulating others through language. Infante and Wigley defined verbal aggressiveness as \\"a personality trait that predisposes persons to attack the self-concepts of other people instead of, or in addition to, their positions on topics of communication\\". Self-concept can be described as a group of values and beliefs that one has. Verbal aggressiveness is thought to be mainly a destructive form of communication, but it can produce positive outcomes. Infante and Wigley described aggressive behavior in interpersonal communication as products of individual's aggressive traits and the way the person perceives the aggressive circumstances that prevents them or something in a situation. Infante, Trebing, Shepard, and Seeds collaborated to showcase the relationship between argumentativeness and verbal aggression. The study investigated two things. The first component investigated whether high, moderate, or low behaviors differ in how easily they are caused by an opponent that selects verbally aggressive responses. The second focused on whether different sexes display different levels of verbal aggression. The results concluded that people who scored high on argumentativeness were the least likely to prefer verbal aggression. Argumentativeness is a constructive, positive trait that recognizes different positions which might exist on issues that are controversial. As for the difference between sexes, males are more likely than females to use verbal aggression because males have been conditioned to be more dominant and competitive. The Verbal Aggressiveness Scale measures the personality trait of verbal aggressiveness and has been widely used in communication research. The VAS has 20 items, 10 that are 10-worded negatively/aggressively, and 10 worded positively/kindly. Infante and Wigley's scale is often scored as unidimensional. Types of messages Reasons or causes There are four primary reasons or causes suggested by Infante, Trebing, Shepard, and Seeds, which are: * Frustration‚Äîin which a goal is blocked by someone or having to deal with an individual deemed \\"unworthy\\" of one's time * Social learning‚Äîin which the aggressive behavior has been learned from observing other individuals * Psychopathology‚Äîin which an individual attacks other persons because of unresolved issues * Argumentative skill deficiency‚Äîin which an individual lacks verbal skills to deal with an issue, and therefore resorts to verbal aggressiveness These motivators of verbal aggressiveness contribute to an individual with a verbally aggressive personality trait. More recently Shaw, Kotowski, Boster, and Levine demonstrated that verbal aggression may be caused by variation in prenatal testosterone exposure. They conducted two studies in which they measured the length of the second and fourth digits (2D:4D) on each hand of participants, an indicator of amount of prenatal androgen exposure, and conducted a questionnaire to determine the verbal aggressiveness of participants. A negative correlation between 2D:4D and verbal aggressiveness was determined. Effects Self-concept damage is the most fundamental effect, which can cause long lasting and more harmful results than the temporal effects. The more temporal and short term effects are: hurt feelings, anger, irritation, embarrassment, discouragement, humiliation, despair, and depression. Verbal aggressiveness that harms an individual's self-concept can follow an individual throughout their life. For instance, Infante and Wigley state \\"the self-concept damage done by teasing a child about an aspect of physical appearance can endure for a lifetime and exert an enormous impact on the amount of unhappiness experience\\".Infante, D.A., & Wrigley, C.J. (1986). \\"Verbal Aggressiveness: An Interpersonal Model and Measure\\". Communication Monographs, 53(1), 61-69. doi:10.1080/03637758609376126 Verbal aggressiveness is also a major cause of violence. When verbal aggressiveness escalates, it often turns into physical violence. Constructive The constructive traits which produce satisfaction and increase relationship contentment by helping to increase understandings between the different positions are assertiveness and argumentativeness. Assertiveness is often confused with aggressiveness, but assertive individuals often possess traits like dominance, independence, and competitiveness. Infante and Rancer define argumentativeness as the \\"trait-like behavior that predisposes an individual to take a stand on controversial issues and attack the positions that other people take\\".Infante, D.A., & Rancer, A.S. (1982). \\"A Conceptualization and Measure of Argumentativeness. Journal of Personality Assessment, 46, 72-80. doi:10.1207/s15327752jpa4601_13 Argumentative individuals focus on the topic rather than attacking an individual. Productive argumentativeness can produce positive outcomes in communication through challenging and defending standpoints through justification. This allows for reasoning between individuals to resolve issue and terminate the disagreement. Argumentative encounters such as this have a positive correlation to relational satisfaction.Weger, H. (2006). \\"Associations Among Romantic Attachment, Argumentativeness, and Verbal Aggressiveness in Romantic Relationships\\". Argumentation and Advocacy, 43, 29-40. doi: 10.1080/00028533.2006.11821660 Destructive The destructive traits, hostility and verbal aggressiveness, lead to dissatisfaction in communication and relationship deterioration. Destructive verbal aggressiveness is used for revenge, teasing, and to manipulate others. Verbal aggressiveness is destructive and links to the hostility trait. Unlike argumentativeness, verbal aggressiveness is focused on defending one's identity and attacking others; not trying to resolve the dispute but instead attacking individuals self- concept. Also, verbally aggressive individuals often do not provide as much evidence to support their standpoint. In many cases these individuals possess verbally aggressive traits because they lack the skills to argue rationally and effectively, and therefore use verbally aggressive messages as their defense mechanism. Individuals with argumentative skill deficiency often see violence as their only alternative. These aggressive tactics cause a digression by using personal attacks which do not allow for the disagreement to ever be resolved. In romantic relationships The manners in which conflicts are dealt with in romantic relationships differ among each partnership. There are numerous concepts, qualities, and traits that predict the verbal aggressiveness of each partner within a romantic relationship. How couples deal with arguments and controversy has been a major topic amongst researchers for many years. When resolving a dispute is the objective amongst a couple, each individual's argumentative traits come into play. The way in which couples engage and act during a discrepancy can play a chief role in the satisfaction of each partner. Verbal aggressiveness often results in deterioration of relational satisfaction. Romantically involved couples can perceive verbally aggressive messages as unaffectionate communication. Infante and et al. found that \\"an act of verbal aggression produces a negative emotional reaction (e.g., anger); the negative reaction can remain covert, leaving a trace effect that can combine additively with subsequent verbal aggression. If the effect if not dissipated through some means, it can lead to the formation of intensions to behave with physical aggression toward the origin or perceived origin of the verbal aggression\\".Infante, D.A., Sabourin, T.C., Rudd, J.E., & Shannon, E. A. (1990). \\"Verbal Aggression in Violent and Nonviolent Marital Disputes.\\" Communication Quarterly, 38(4), 361-371. doi: 10.1080/01463379009369773 Verbal aggressiveness is impacted by the commitment levels of the partners in a relationship. Research findings have shown a negative correlation between commitment and destructive confrontation, and also commitment and communicative acts of abuse.Rill, L., Baiocchi, E., Hopper, M., Denker, K., & Olson, L.N. (2009). \\"Exploration of the Relationship between Self-Esteem, Commitment, and Verbal Aggressiveness in Romantic Dating Relationships\\". Communication Reports, 22(2),102-113. doi: 10.1080/08934210903061587 The arguments that occur between romantic partners play a crucial role in the quality and course of relationships. Arguing successfully means, at least in some part, that a couple will avoid unwarranted negativity and approach discrepancies in confidence that discussing dissimilarities of opinion will supply positive results. Many couples refocus the argument and attack the other partner rather than staying on track with the differences of opinion on a subject. Unhappily married couples tend to use a more destructive approach to conflict. Verbal aggressiveness is resorted to in conflict and controversy. Infante and et al. found that in violent marriages more character attacks and competence attacks are used during disputes. Happily married couples were more likely to resolve disputes without the use of verbally aggressive messages, using instead argumentativeness to negotiate an agreement. In families Communication between parents and children influences children and can have important effects for the well-being of the child. It can also have important influences on the relationship between the child and the parent. Muris, Meesters, Morren, and Moorman found that, \\"attachment style and perceived parent rearing styles that included low levels of emotional warmth were more likely to result in anger and hostility in children\\".Muris, P., Meesters, C., Morren, M., & Moorman, L. (2004). \\"Anger and Hostility in Adolescents: Relationships with Self-Report Attachment Style and Perceived Parental Rearing Styles\\". Journal of Psychosomatic Research, 57, 257-264. doi: 10.1016/S0022-3999(03)00616-0 Also, Riesch, Anderson, and Krueger argued that \\"parent-child communication can help reduce risk behaviors through individual risk factors such as self- esteem, academic achievement, and parental involvement in monitoring\\".Riesch, S.K., Anderson, L.S., & Krueger, H.A. (2006). \\"Parent-Child Communication Processes: Preventing Children's Health-Risk Behaviors\\". Journal for Specialist in Pediatric Nursing, 11, 41-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1744-6155.2006.00042.x Knapp, Stafford, and Daly stated, \\"verbally aggressive behavior is contextual: most parents likely have said something verbally aggressive to their child at some point, even if they later regretted doing so\\".Knapp, M.L., Stafford, L., & Daly, J.A. (1986). \\"Regrettable Messages: Things People Wish They Haven't Said\\". Journal of Communication, 36,p. 40-58. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1986.tb01449.x The parental use of verbal aggressiveness can cause a disruption in the relationship between the child and the parent. When a parent uses verbally aggressive behavior children are often frightened, which leads to avoidance of the parent. The verbal aggressiveness causes the child to feel fear and anxiety and therefore the child loses trust in their relationship. Parental verbal aggressiveness has a negative correlation with relational satisfaction and closeness to their children. Studies found that parents who are verbally aggressive tend to have children who are also verbally aggressive. This is proven through Bandura's social learning theory. Children who are consistently around their parents are likely to model their behavior.McClure, L., Carlyle, K., & Roberto, A. (2005). \\"The Relationship Between Parents' Use of Verbal and Physical Aggression and Children's Relational Satisfaction in Closeness with Their Parents\\". Conference Papers -- International Communication Association, 1-29. doi: 10.1080/15267430802561659 According to the attachment theory, all humans are dependent on one or several individuals during the early years of their lives. It is important to understand how a parent's verbal aggressiveness can change the attachment style the child has toward the parent.Ainsworth, M.D., & Bowldy, J. (1991). \\"Ethological Approach to Personality Development\\" American Psychologist, 46, 333-34. http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/online/ainsworth_bowlby_1991.pdf If a parent is shown as attacking a child's self-image, it is likely that these attacks will hinder the growth of a confident attachment style. Styron and Janoff-Bulman found, \\"more than 60% of participants who had been verbally abused as children had reported an insecure attachment style\\".Styron, T., & Janoff-Bulman, R. (1997). \\"Childhood Attachment and Abuse: Long-term Effects of Adult Attachment, Depression, and Conflict Resolution\\". Child Abuse and Neglect, 21, 1015-2023. doi: 10.1080/10926770903475968 Authoritative parents are characterized by encouraging and democratic behaviors. These types of parents value verbal \\"give-and-take.\\" Authoritarian parents prefer punishment as a way to control their child's behavior and they value obedience from their children. Parents low in verbal aggression tend to adopt an authoritative parenting style and that is positively related to a secure attachment style.Bayer, C.L., & Cegala, D.J. (1992). \\"Trait Verbal Aggressiveness and Argumentativeness: Relations with Parenting Style\\". Western Journal of Communication, 56, 302-310. doi: 10.1080/10570319209374418  In athletics  Communication plays a significant role in the athlete-coach relationship. Verbal aggression has been identified as prominent in athletics. Coaches who exhibit verbal aggressive behavior may influence athletes' performance, competence, overall enjoyment, and motivation. Symrpas and Bekiari conducted a study that was aimed to determine two things. The first one was to explore the perceived leadership style and verbal aggressive profile of coaches. The second was to look for differences in athletes' satisfaction and achievement goal orientation based on perceived coaches' leadership style and verbal aggressive profile. The study supported two profiles of coaches. The first profile included coaches who present a low autocratic (harsh) behavior, high democratic (fair) behavior, and low verbal aggressive behavior. The second profile included coaches who present a high autocratic, low democratic, and high verbal aggressive behavior. Based upon the results, coaches categorized within the first profile promoted athletes' satisfaction where their mental state was filled with compassion. Athletes who are more task-oriented that perform tasks to achieve their desired outcome, considered that their coaches belong to the first profile which did not impact their performance in a negative way.  In customer service  Customer incivility can be described as verbal aggression towards customer service employees. It can negatively impact customer service perceptions and potentially crumble an organization's competitive status. Today, customer incivility is known as customer verbal aggression towards employees through language content and communication style. Customer verbal aggression can happen in places such as restaurants, retail stores, banks, etc. Walker, Jaarsveld, and Skarlicki performed a study that focused on developing an understanding of what customers do in service events that can increase employee incivility toward others. Employee incivility has four total factors involved: aggressive words, second person pronoun use (you, your), interruptions, and positive emotion words. Positive associations between customer aggressive words and employee incivility was clear when verbal aggression included second person pronouns, labeled as targeted aggression. The researchers observed interactions that included two people between targeted aggression and customer interruptions where employees demonstrated more offensive language when the targeted customer verbal aggression was followed by more interruptions. The 2-way interactions predicting employee incivility was lessened when customers used positive emotion words. Saying something like, \\"I know you charged me twice, but we can try to work this out together,\\" is an example. The results suggested that customer verbal aggression consumes employees, leading to self-regulation failure. The customer using positive emotional language increases the ability of the employee to engage in self-regulation and reduce incivility. Self- regulation is important with interactions in the workplace. To communicate effectively in social environments while helping customers, the key objective must be emotional labor. Emotional labor is the self-regulatory process that unfolds over the course of customer interactions, with employees monitoring and adjusting their felt and expressed emotion. A goal in which employees use during emotional labor is to produce effective and emotional displays that enhance the customer experience. The self-regulatory approach provides insight into how felt emotions, displayed emotions, and emotion regulation may relate to each other over time.

It was investigated by Harold Huscher and a team of University of Georgia students in the early 1970s. Background In the early 1970s, Troup Country, Georgia was in the midst of archaeological investigations by a contract with the University of Georgia and the National Park Service. Between 1970 and 1972, the contract archaeologists were searching for historically documented Muscogee villages located within the West Point Lake reservoir project area; at this time all fieldwork was limited to the Park Mound Site. In 1969, Huscher and his students began archaeological investigations of the Park Mound site, where initial clearing of vegetation was the primary goal to prepare for future excavations. It was not until later, in 1973, when the mound was investigated further with funds from a grant supported by the Callaway Foundation of LaGrange, Georgia. Park Mound is located on a large triangular portion of the flood plain at the junction of Yellow Jacket Creek and the Chattahoochee River. The site consisted of a single substructure platform mound measuring northwest to southeast and northeast to southwest and is high with surrounding village midden deposits. The villages were only occupied on the northern and northeastern sides of the mound. All the pottery recovered during the excavations in 1972 was identifiable as Bull Creek complex. A small number of Archaic lithic artifacts were also discovered, dating to late Etowah or Savannah phase time period, signifying brief occupation. David J. Hally and Leila Oertal at the University of Georgiahttp://anthropology.uga.edu/ compiled post excavations, archeological reports. The Park Mound site was destroyed at the completion of the West Point Lake reservoir in 1975.http://www.trouparchives.org/index.php/history/troup_county_timeline/ Yellow Jacket Creek is currently a recreational park area in southwestern central Georgia near the West Point Lake reservoir. http://www.troupcountyga.org/localattractions.html References Category:Archaeological sites in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Native American history of Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Park Mound"},{"id":"33919936","title":"The Devil's Dinner Party"},{"id":"33919951","text":"Mycoleptodiscus is a genus of fungi in the family Magnaporthaceae.

Internet water armies were born in the early 2010s. These paid posters can post news, comments, gossip, disinformation on some online platforms such as Weibo, WeChat and Taobao, China's eBay-like platform. In this \\"astroturfing\\" (meaning \\"artificial grass-roots\\") technique for public relations and media manipulation, online Chinese companies employ people to make postings on social media in order to change public opinion. It has been developed into an industry in which a company specializing in internet water army can earn 7.6 million RMB within three months and has made over 2500 transactions. The private Internet Water Army operations parallel the official 50 Cent Party propagandist Internet commentators hired by the government of the People's Republic of China or the Chinese Communist Party.  Related Background  Chinese \\"Internet navy\\" Wangluo shuijun were preceded by government and private organizations that paid professional Internet commentators. Governmental programs of social media manipulation are found worldwide. China's 50 Cent Party (named from the 0.5 yuan payment per posting) trains and employs tens of thousands of online commentators to promote the PRC party line and control public opinion on microblogs, bulletin board systems, and chatrooms. The social media marketing business model did not originate in China, and is a worldwide phenomenon exemplified by companies such as FansandInvites in the US, SocioNiks in the United Kingdom, and uSocial in Australia. For instance, uSocial sells their customers Digg votes, Twitter followers, and Facebook friends;Friends for sale: What is a Facebook friend worth? , The Economist, September 17, 2009. Hamilton Nolan, a blog editor at Gawker, revealed a marketing agency that offered bribes ‚Äì first $130, then $175 ‚Äì for linking their clients' websites.Hamilton Nolan, Blog Bribes: The Shady Marketing Scheme That‚Äôs Buying Off Your Favorite Bloggers , Gawker, October 26, 2011. Adario Strange reported on Internet advertising companies trying to game Digg's ranking system through paying registered users for votes.Adario Strange, Hacking Social Media: Subvert And Profit Vs. Digg , Wired Epicenter, April 5, 2007. For instance, the Subvert And Profit website claims \\"25,000 users who earn money by viewing, voting, fanning, rating, or posting assigned task\\", with payments ranging from $0.40 (e.g., Facebook) to $1.00 (e.g., Digg).Subvert and Profit. Chrysanthos Dellarocas, a professor of Management at Boston University, said: \\"Online forum manipulation strategies can take many forms, and firms (or, depending on the context of interest, political parties and special interest groups) are getting more sophisticated about them by the day. The simplest firm strategy is to anonymously post online reviews praising its own products, or bad-mouthing those of its competitors. There is ample evidence that such manipulation takes place.\\"Chrysanthos Dellarocas (2004), Strategic Manipulation of Internet Opinion Forums , MIT Sloan Working Papers No. 4501-04. For instance, Amy Harmon reported about a computer glitch on Amazon.com that suddenly revealed the identities of thousands of people who had anonymously posted book reviews. Several prominent publishers and authors, such as John Rechy, had \\"pseudonymously written themselves five-star reviews, Amazon's highest rating,\\" and Amazon consequently stopped accepting anonymous reviews.Amy Harmon (2004), Amazon Glitch Unmasks War of Reviewers , The New York Times, February 14, 2004. Some marketing firms monitor online forums to ascertain influential contributors, who they offer free samples and special invitations in exchange for writing favorable reviews.Dellarocas (2004) mentions Electricartists.com, which is now Bondinfluence.com. Names The Chinese name combines the modern word wangluo ÁΩëÁªú (lit. \\"internet\\") meaning \\"network; Internet; the Net\\" with the archaic term shuijun Ê∞¥ÂÜõ (lit. \\"water army\\") \\"navy; marine units\\" ‚Äì the more common Chinese word is haijun Êµ∑ÂÜõ (\\"ocean army\\") \\"navy\\".The translation of neologisms into Chinese sometimes varies regionally; Internet, for instance, is commonly translated as hulianwang ‰∫íËÅîÁΩë/‰∫íËÅØÁ∂≤ or wangluo ÁΩëÁªú/Á∂≤Áµ° in the People's Republic of China; or as wangji wanglu ÁΩëÈôÖÁΩëË∑Ø/Á∂≤ÈöõÁ∂≤Ë∑Ø, abbreviated wanglu ÁΩëË∑Ø/Á∂≤Ë∑Ø in Taiwan. This shuijun \\"water army\\" metaphor refers to \\"the large number of people who are well organized to flood the Internet with purposeful comments and articles.\\"Cheng et al. (2011), p. 1. The Chinese etymology of shuijun meaning \\"navy\\" instead of \\"water army\\" is translated in the Shuijunshiwan Ê∞¥ÂÜõÂçÅ‰∏á (lit. \\"navy 100,000\\") company slogan: \\"Thousands of navy, for your assignment.\\" Besides the literal \\"Internet Water Army\\" or \\"Internet Navy,\\" other English translations include \\"Online Water Army,\\"Bruce Sterling, The Chinese online ‚ÄòWater Army‚Äô , Wired, June 25, 2010. and \\"Army of Water\\",Daniel Z.

Adam Clark Estes describes the name, \\"If the term \\"Internet troll\\" conjures up unintimidating images of angry, acne-faced computer geeks, the phrase \\"Internet water army\\" just sounds horrifying, like a force of besuited villains from a graphic novel. In reality, it's not that scary, but the continually booming business for paid spammers and mission-driven trolls is definitely unsettling.\\"Adam Clark Estes, he Spam-Slinging Habits of China's Internet Water Army , The Atlantic Wire, November 23, 2011. Xinhua News Agency reported on a new Water Army title, \\"zombies\\" (Chinese jiangshi ÂÉµÂ∞∏) who are paid followers of Sina Weibo microblogs, and \\"can be bought and sold online for as little as 4 yuan (63 cents) a thousand.\\"\\"Zombies\\" and \\"phantom\\" fans haunt online statistics , 2011-11-22. Several names of Internet Water Army companies, such as Shuijunwang.com and 51shuijun.net, use the homophone shuijun Ê∞¥Âêõ \\"water gentleman\\" instead of shuijun \\"water army; navy\\", which is subject to Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China.  Features  Paid postings involve thousands of individuals and posters use different online IDs. Every day, around 40 percent of the trending hashtags on the social media platform are created by Internet water armies. The content is usually well-prepared and there is a quality control team to check whether the postings meet the customer's standard. Some companies hire Internet water army to leave good comments under their selling products' feedback, and some singers or film stars also pay them to be fake followers on Weibo, the Chinese twitter. The price for posting good comments and bad comments is different and it depends on the content. If there are negative reviews about a product or some gossip targeting a person, he needs to pay the Internet water army for screening and deleting those negative reviews. There is some difference between internet water army and 50 cent party. The concept of 50 cent party is narrower since it only refers to paid posters who deflect political discussions and post any positive and supporting reviews related with the central government. According to a Harvard study in 2017, it is estimated that there are 448 million social media comments fabricated by the \\"50 cent party\\" hired by Chinese government. These comments avoid touching upon controversial and sensitive issues.  Types  There is no limitation to joining the Internet water army. Low-end migrants, housewives and students are the main force. There are basically three types of Internet water army. The first type is the one which voluntarily spreads the posts promoting social justice. The second type is the one mainly hired by the government or state-owned companies to promote propaganda or ensure social stability. The third type is the one working for private companies, such as public relations companies, to pursue their own interest. Tactics Many tactics of Internet Water Army companies are typically considered acceptable, these include word-of-mouth marketing, viral marketing, marketing buzz, seeding agency, and e-marketing. Some other tactics are considered unacceptable, these include spam in blogs or \\"comment spam\\", social networking spam or \\"social spam\\", and content farms. Techniques also include two forms of the Internet slang \\"puppetry\\": sockpuppetry (the use pseudonyms to distance yourself from your actions, especially if the pseudonym is non-obvious and so designed to deceive) and meatpuppetry (a sockpuppet whose sole reason for participating in a discussion or forum is to support, or express agreement with, a friend)Definitions from Wiktionary. A 2010 news story on China Central Television(ÁÑ¶ÁÇπËÆøË∞à)Êè≠ÁßòÁΩëÁªú\\"Êé®Âπø\\" , CCTV 2010.11.7. listed three customer services of Internet Water Army companies: (1) Promotion of a specific product, company, person or message; (2) Smear/slander the competitor or adversary or competitors‚Äô products or services; (3) Help delete negative or unfavorable posts or news articles.Tr. by Sui (2011). Pricing for \\"Internet Navy\\" tactics varies. Shanghai Daily quoted Tang Jing, an employee of the Web PR company Shuijunshiwang.com, that prices range from a \\"basic zombie\\" for less than 5 yuan ($0.79) per 1,000 on the internet marketplace Taobao to an \\"A-level zombie\\" having \\"the characteristics of a real person, with a photo, self-description, tags of categories and its own fans\\" for 120 yuan ($18.86) per 5,000.Shanghai Daily (2011). Cheng Chen, a computer science researcher at the University of Victoria, and three colleagues made an academic study of Internet water army activities.Cheng Chen, Kui Wu, Venkatesh Srinivasan, and Xudong Zhang, Battling the Internet Water Army: Detection of Hidden Paid Posters arXiv, Cornell University Library. To learn how online Chinese ghostwriters operate, Cheng registered undercover with an Internet PR company that trained and paid him to make social media postings.Cheng et al. (2011), p. 3 Each mission had a project manager; a trainer team that plans schedules, distributes shared user IDs, and maintains quality control; a posters team, typically college students and unemployed people, that gets 30 to 50 cents per validated post; a resources team that registers and collects online user IDs; and a PR team that maintains relationships with social media webmasters.  Reasons  Online marketing in China has become a big and profitable business and has spawned many Internet public relations agencies. Internet water armies working for these PR firms not only advertise products but also to remove any negative feedback that they find. In recent years, many celebrity agencies in the entertainment industry and their die-hard fans have been willing to spend millions of yuan to hire Internet water armies to generate positive online reviews for their songs, movies, etc. These Internet water armies can range from a handful of people to hundreds, of people and often help those celebrities to inflate their social media accounts' followers with thousands of completely useless followers. In addition, some entertainment companies use Internet water armies to bump up film ratings and smear a rival's reputation. For many people who join the \\"Internet water army\\", they think online paid postings is a new type of online part-time job opportunity and is an easy way to make money. With the ubiquity of personal computers and smart phones along with easy-to-use microblogging platforms, the entry barrier is low. The income of Internet water armies is a primary reason why many people choose to join them, more than 60% of Internet water army members earn more than a thousand yuan per month by posting and deleting reviews.  Current Affairs  After Cybersecurity Law came into effect in June, 2017, Chinese government paid more attention to crack down on fake news and rumors online. China is battling with the Internet water army. In 2017, Chinese Internet regulator imposed strict bans on hiring paid posters as a part of a sweeping campaign to tighten the Internet control. Police arrested more than 200 people in 40 water army cases and closed 5,000 paid poster accounts since May, 2017. In June, a man was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison and fined 920,000 yuan ($135,000) for generating fake transactions and product reviews on Taobao. This is the first judicial case that a suspect was charged with this offense in China. In July 2018, the producer of Asura,a Chinese epic fantasy film based on Buddhist mythology, said that their movie's rating was brought down by fake comments on an influential rating platform. Therefore, many Chinese young people generally ask their friends' comments about a movie as they know the feedback online is not reliable. In August 2018, Guangzhou's latest move targeting the Internet water army was about a larger scale crackdown launched by China's public security authority, involving 77 suspects and 4 million yuan ($635,000). Legal problems Net marketing companies like Internet Water Army sometimes operate on murky legal grounds, particularly under international law. The US companies Facebook and Digg sent cease and desist orders to the Australian company uSocial, which ignored them and continues to market \\"friends\\" and \\"votes\\".Facebook acts on follower trade , BBC News, 20 November 2009.Michael Learmonth, Want 5,000 More Facebook Friends? That'll Be $654.30 , Advertising Age September 02, 2009. China, unlike many countries, has a strict cyber defamation law, and some Internet Water Army companies have been accused of violating it. Internet Water Army practices often result in privacy violations or damaged reputations, and the 2009 revision of China's Tort Liability Law stipulated that in such cases, \\"the victim has the right to inform the Internet service provider (ISP) to delete harmful postings and that the ISP must face joint liability for damages if it fails to act.\\"Mo (2010). China's State Council Information Office announced in 2011 that it \\"is working out laws to regulate the increasing numbers in the \\"Internet Army.\\" Wang Chen, director of the office, announced that the Chinese government has paid constant attention to the posters and commentators, who have been found damaging social order both in the real and the virtual world.\\"Taobao takes aim at 'Internet Army' , Shanghai Daily, January 7, 2011. In 2007, the cosmetics firm Doctor Bai and health-food company BiosTime both sued the consumer protection website 315ts.net for posting fake comments about their products. \\"Judges eventually ruled in the website's favor because there was no evidence to suggest the posts were not genuine.\\"Duan Yan The invisible hands behind Web postings , China Daily, 2010-06-17. According to a 2010 China Daily report, Mengniu Dairy denied paying a Wangluo zhujun company to spread false rumors about dairy products of their competitors Yili Group and Synbutra International.Chen Xiu, Dairy giant Mengniu in smear scandal , China Daily 2010-10-21. The Shanghai Daily reported in 2011 that the online shopping website Taobao shut down over 200 Internet Water Army companies selling microblog followers. Detection Internet water armies are a big threat for cyber security. IT researchers have experimented with statistics and software to detect paid commenters from real-world ones. Some scholars adopt Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) based GSP algorithm to detect Internet water armies from Tianya forum. They use DPMM to get effective analysis of the Internet water army's user behavior and use the sequential pattern mining algorithms to detect those paid posters' accounts. An information technology engineer, blogging as \\"Chen Chuanliang Peter\\", claimed to have developed software that differentiated paid blog \\"followers,\\" and found that about 17 percent of followers on Sina's ten most popular microblogs \\"never interacted or responded to those they were following. In other words, they were zombies.\\"Xinhua (2011). Cheng Chen et al. chose a detection case study of online comments about the 360 v. Tencent conflict between two major Chinese IT companies, each of which was suspected of paying for posts. In 2010, Qihoo, creator of the anti-virus software 360 Safeguard, claimed that Tencent's instant message client Tencent QQ secretly scanned users' hard drives. After Tencent blocked users of 360 software from using their QQ messaging, controversy erupted on social media websites. Cheng's researchers analyzed two large datasets of 360 v. Tencent postings, over 1000 comments from 200 users on Sohu.com and over 20,000 comments from 500 users on Sina.com. They concluded, \\"Although both 360 and Tencent claimed that they did not hire online paid posters, we now have strong evidence suggesting the opposite. Some special patterns are definitely unusual, e.g., many negative comments or replies came from newly registered user IDs but these user IDs were seldom used afterwards. This clearly indicates the use of online paid posters.\\"Cheng et al. (2011), p. 3. The researchers designed and validated detection software, and concluded, \\"Our test results on real-world datasets show very promising performance.\\" See also *50 Cent Party *Trolls from Olgino *Web brigades *Public opinion brigades *State-sponsored internet sockpuppetry *Little Pink References External links *China's Cybersecurity Law: What You Need to Know, The Diplomat *Undercover Researchers Expose Chinese Internet Water Army, Technology Review *\\"ÁΩëÁªúÊ∞¥ÂÜõ\\"‰∏çÊñ≠Âà∂ÈÄ†\\"ÁΩëÁªúÊö¥Âäõ\\"ÔºöÁêÜÊÄßÁúãÂæÖÁΩëÁªúÊ∞ëÊÑè, ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÁΩë, 12/1/2010 *ÁΩëÁªúÊ∞¥ÂÜõÁâüÂà©‰πãÈÅìÔºöÂàÜ25Á∫ß Êé•ÂçïÊØèÂ∏ñÊúÄ‰Ωé7ÊØõ, ËÖæËÆØÁΩëÊñ∞, 1/9/2011 Category:Chinese Internet slang Category:Internet censorship in China Category:Public relations techniques Category:Propaganda in China Category:Propaganda techniques Category:Internet manipulation and propaganda Category:Internet trolling ","title":"Internet Water Army"},{"id":"33919985","text":"Nakataea is a genus of fungi in the family Magnaporthaceae.

Michelia 2(no. 6): 20. 1880 The polyphyletic nature of Pyricularia has been resolved and species of Pyricularia s. str. were shown to belong to a monophyletic clade (including Pyricularia grisea isolates), defining the family Pyriculariaceae.  Etymology  The genus Pyricularia is named after the pyriform (pear-shaped) shape of its conidia.  Pathogenicity  The genus Pyricularia includes species that are pathogenic on a wide range of monocot plants. For example, Pyricularia oryzae (sexual morph Magnaporthe oryzae), the causal agent of the rice blast disease, is one of the most widely distributed diseases of rice, and is highly destructive leading to up to 30% yield loss worldwide. Pyricularia oryzae isolates from rice are mostly host-specific and infect only few host plants beside rice (barley and Lolium).Ou S.H. CAB International; Wallingford, UK: 1985. Rice diseases. Pyricularia oryzae isolates from other host plants such as Eleusine, Setaria and Triticum are also host-specific, and unable to infect rice. The closely related species P. oryzae and Pyricularia grisea are indistinguishable in morphology of conidium, perithecium and ascopore. Pyricularia grisea isolates from Digitaria were shown to form a distinct clade by phylogenetic analysis and infect crabgrass (Digitaria), but not other hosts. However, some P. oryzae isolates from rice and other grasses and some P. grisea isolates from crabgrass were described to show cross-infectivity on crabgrass and rice, respectively.  Sexual morphs  Sexual morphs were reported for P. grisea and P. oryzae. The genus Pyricularia comprises several other species for which the sexual morph has not yet been discovered. Species *Pyricularia angulata *Pyricularia apiculata *Pyricularia borealis *Pyricularia buloloensis *Pyricularia caffra *Pyricularia cannae *Pyricularia cannicola *Pyricularia caricis *Pyricularia commelinicola *Pyricularia costi *Pyricularia costina *Pyricularia curcumae *Pyricularia cyperi *Pyricularia didyma *Pyricularia digitariae *Pyricularia distorta *Pyricularia dubiosa *Pyricularia ebbelsii *Pyricularia echinochloae *Pyricularia euphorbiae *Pyricularia fusispora *Pyricularia globbae *Pyricularia grisea *Pyricularia guarumaicola *Pyricularia juncicola *Pyricularia kookicola *Pyricularia lauri *Pyricularia leersiae *Pyricularia longispora *Pyricularia lourinae *Pyricularia luzulae *Pyricularia occidentalis *Pyricularia oncosperma *Pyricularia oryzae *Pyricularia panici- paludosi *Pyricularia parasitica *Pyricularia penniseti *Pyricularia peruamazonica *Pyricularia pyricularioides *Pyricularia rabaulensis *Pyricularia sansevieriae *Pyricularia scripta *Pyricularia setariae *Pyricularia sphaerulata *Pyricularia submersa *Pyricularia subsigmoidea *Pyricularia vandalurensis *Pyricularia variabilis *Pyricularia whetzelii *Pyricularia zingiberis *Pyricularia zizaniicola  Taxonomy  Conidia are solitary, pyriform to obclavate, narrowed toward tip, rounded at the base, 2-septate, hyaline to pale brown, with a distinct basal hilum, sometimes with marginal frill. Type species: Pyricularia grisea Sacc., Michelia 2(no. 6): 20. 1880.  Family  Species of Pyricularia s. str. belong to a monophyletic clade that includes P. oryzae/P. grisea isolates, and was defined as Pyriculariaceae. Pyriculariaceae is sister to the Ophioceraceae, representing two novel families. These clades are clearly distinct from species belonging to the Gaeumannomyces pro parte/Magnaporthiopsis/Nakataea generic complex that are monophyletic and define the family Magnaporthaceae.

Three of the six songs on the album--\\"My Funny Valentine\\", \\"'Round Midnight\\", and \\"Conception\\"--were regular features in Baker's concerts at the time. A fourth song, \\"Visa\\", was a bebop composition written by Charlie Parker, a musician Baker played with early in his career. Joining Haden and Baker on the album are drummer Billy Higgins and pianist Enrico Pieranunzi. The album is similar in musical programming and band format to the series of albums Haden made with his Quartet West group. As with the original Quartet West group, Silence features a jazz quartet anchored by Haden and Higgins. The bassist and drummer worked together sporadically from the late 1950s (when both were members of Ornette Coleman's band) through the 1990s. Silence was recorded between the first and second Quartet West albums. In 1990, the trio of Haden, Higgins and Pieranunzi recorded Haden's First Song album for the same label.

Kinshasa lies on a plain that is surrounded by hills, drained by many rivers. Of these, the Lukunga is one of the more important, and for this reason gives its name to the Lukunga District of the city. The river originates to the west at an elevation of in the hills of Ngomba Kikusa, in the commune of Ngaliema. It is no wider than and is never deeper than due to constant deposits of sediment. The river drains Ngaliema, the Mama Mobutu neighborhood and part of Mont-Ngafula, and forms the boundary between Ngaliema and Mont-Ngafule. On its right bank the Lukunga is fed first by the Ikusu River, which has its source at a height of and then by the Mbinza River, which rises at a height of . Before independence, one of the two water treatment plants for Leopoldville, now Kinshasa, was on the Lukunga river at Kinsuka in the Ngaliema district.

The station was built in 1939, and supplies about of drinking water annually for a population of at least 500,0000. The catchment area was protected by dense forest cover until the 1970s. Since then, unplanned agriculture and building have exposed the steep and sandy soils to erosion by heavy rainfalls, raising levels of turbidity to the point where the station must halt operations. Frequent dredging is needed to keep the channel open, as well as use of imported chemical coagulants and lime to make the water drinkable.

The event showcased a selection of groundbreaking websites from the early days of the web, congruously displayed on the hardware and software they were designed on and for. History The Digital Archaeology exhibition, organised by Jim Boulton, made its debut at Internet Week Europe 2010. The show celebrates the golden era of the website but more importantly, it seeks to document the formative years of digital culture and raise the profile of web archiving. The debut exhibition showcased 15 groundbreaking websites and featured a keynote presentation by Helen Hockx-Yu, Web Archiving Programme Manager at The British Library. Such was the level of interest, Boulton was invited to run it again at Internet Week New York 2011 in an expanded format, where it attracted 12,000 visitors. The New York show was sponsored by Google and featured a keynote presentation by Abigail Grotke, Web Archiving Team Lead at the Library of Congress. The event was held again, in a reduced form, as part of Digital Shoreditch 2013, where it was visited by the team at CERN responsible for restoring the first website. Curator Jim Boulton said of the importance of the event \\"Today, when almost a quarter of the earth's population is online, this artistic, commercial and social history is being wiped from the face of the earth. Unless we act now to archive our recent digital past, we are in real danger of losing the building blocks of the web that have so shaped modern culture.\\" Digital Archaeology featured as a key part of a larger exhibition, called Digital Revolution debuting at The Barbican in 2014 and now at the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm. Featured websites The Project - 1991 The Project was the first website to connect and share documents on personal computers via the internet. It was published by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1991 and used HTML 1.0. Its first web address was https://web.archive.org/web/20150717103715/http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html, which described the WorldWideWeb project. No screenshots were kept of the very first website. The website featured at Digital Archaeology is believed to be the earliest available copy, from 1992. Antirom - 1994 The Antirom art collective was formed in London in 1994 as a ‚Äúprotest against ill-conceived point-and-click interfaces grafted onto repurposed old content repackaged as multimedia.‚Äù With the radical vision to explore interactivity as a media in its own right rather than as an interface to content, Antirom changed the face of interactive design. The original experiments were funded by a grant from the Arts Council of Great Britain. Design agency Tomato contributed graphically, and the band Underworld provided the music. Developed rapidly by multiple authors, Antirom's interactive experiments often revolved around a single idea, such as sound mixing or scrolling. Although always entertaining, these playful, interactive ‚Äútoys‚Äù could deliberately confound, forcing the user into an active relationship with the media. Built in Director 5 (Shockwave). Word.com - 1995 Founded by Dan Pelson, Tom Livacarri and Carey Earle in 1995, Word.com was one of the earliest and most influential e-zines. Unlike many web publications of the time, which simply re-created the print magazine format online, Word.com was a true multimedia experience, incorporating games, audio, and chat. Its DIY ethos and first-person conversational style immediately appealed its audience of ‚Äúunderachieving sub- geniuses,‚Äù and the site was soon receiving 95,000 page views a day. Its authentic content (notably the Shockwave game SiSSYFiGHT, often cited as one of the earliest examples of massively multiplayer online games) and Yoshi Sodeoka's icon-driven design influenced hundreds of other sites, yet it was never a commercial success. But Word.com was also far from commercially na√Øve ‚Äî a pioneer in the use of online advertising, it was the first website to integrate paid content for branded microsites. The site used HTML2.0, Director 5 & RealAudio. The Blue Dot - 1995 Razorfish became one of the world's most established digital agencies partly because of a bouncing blue dot. Created out of an apartment in the East Village, its homepage utilized the server-push GIF-animation capabilities of Netscape Navigator 1.1 to create the first animated website ‚Äî crashing many a browser in the process. Razorfish founders Jeffrey Dachis and Craig Kanarick followed this milestone with one of the first online art galleries, The Blue Dot. Created ‚Äúfor our souls‚Äù rather than commercial gain, The Blue Dot was a playground of art, design, photography, and provocation, showcasing work by artists like Ryan McGinness, Spencer Tunick, and Jill Greenberg. It notoriously included such delights as ‚ÄúThe Society for the Recapture of Virginity‚Äù and ‚ÄúDick for a Day.‚Äù The Blue Dot is now in the permanent collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The site used HTML2.0, Director 5 & RealAudio. CyberOrchids - 1996 Designer, programmer, technologist, artist, professor, author: John Maeda is all of these and more. Now president of the Rhode Island School of Design, the former associate research director of MIT's Media Lab has also enjoyed a long and productive commercial partnership with Japanese cosmetic brand Shiseido. Commissioned to accompany Shiseido's orchid e-commerce service, John Maeda's CyberOrchids, built as a Java applet, was one of the first e-card tools. The site used HTML 2.0, Java. The Web Stalker - 1997 Webby Award-winner and ‚Äúthe first internet application designed by artists,‚Äù The Web Stalker is an experimental browser developed by British web-art activists I/O/D. Working on the principle that the browsers of the day (Netscape Navigator 4.01 and Internet Explorer 3.0) were built to fulfil commercial imperatives determined by advertisers and software corporations rather than the information needs of the individual, The Web Stalker browser stripped out the superfluous, so only the raw text, links, and meta data remained. Built in Director 6. Noodle Box - 1997 Using Director 6 software, Noodle Box was a series of computer game like interactive experiments. Created by Play/Create and designed by Daniel Brown, the site featured a landscape of building blocks, inspired by the computer games of the 1980s. The site was set apart from many others of its time due to the playful nature of the site. Built in Director 6. Noodlebox appears in the San Francisco MOMA and the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A;). Head-space - 1997 The Head-space Project, created and curated by Jason Holland and Felix Velarde and produced by Head New Media, was a collaborative creative space and a spawning ground for multiple interactive projects such as the Brixton-based community website Urban 75 and John Lundberg's CircleMakers.org but was perhaps most famous for the interactive game Slap a Spice Girl. The site used both Director & HTML 3. K10k - 1997 K10k, also known as ‚ÄúThe Designers‚Äô Lunchbox,‚Äù was a global digital design portal. The site was the result of a chance meeting online between Toke Nygaard and Michael Schmidt. Nygaard and Schmidt gained inspiration from sites like DigitalThread.com and Shift.jp.org but wanted to create something that was ‚Äúfresher and funkier, and updated every single week.‚Äù The site was built by Cuban Council and is built in HTML 4.0. Less Rain - 1998 Less Rain was founded in 1997 by Vassilios Alexiou and Lars Eberle. The name they chose for their company not only reflects London's temperate climate but also their design philosophy. Clean, natural, playful and unpredictable. Kicking against the vector graphic trend dominating interaction design at the time, their early work had a hand-crafted feel, driven by photography. The first site they designed for themselves, nicknamed Walter The Fish, typified their approach. Walter was a grouper, bought at Billingsgate Fish Market in 1998. Photographed at five stages of consumption, he provided the navigation system for Less Rain's website. Those visiting on fast connection speeds were served the full fish. Slower speeds were offered the bare bones. Built in HTML 3.0, Director 6.0 (Shockwave) New Beetle - 1998 Founded in 1994, Deepend was one of the first true web design agencies. The Web's slow connection speeds, limited fonts and restricted colour palette deterred most designers. Gary Lockton, David Streek and Simon Waterfall were the exception. While their contemporaries were exploring the technical capabilities of the web, Deepend defined its aesthetic potential. Deepend websites for VW Beetle, Hoover and the Design Museum in ‚Äô98, ‚Äô99 and 2000 set the standard the rest of the industry aspired to. Incorporating great design, audio, video and games, they pushed the medium way beyond its supposed limits. Built in HTML 3.0, Flash 3.0, QuickTime 3.0 Modern Living - 1998 Starting off life as a comic strip in 1996, Dutchman Han Hoogerbrugge began publishing his Modern Living / Neurotica animations to his website as a series of looping GIFs in ‚Äô98. Soon afterward, he progressed to Flash, which introduced an interactive element to his art. Describing his work as an ongoing self-portrait, the central theme of Hoogerbrugge‚Äôs work is his battle with modern life. The repetitive, jerky nature of his animations that so accurately reflect his neurosis are actually a result of the bandwidth restrictions of 1998. A 28k modem necessitates the short, low-frame-rate animations he has become famous for. The series concluded in 2001 when the 100th episode was published. Subsequent work includes the non-linear interactive story ‚ÄúHotel,‚Äù developed for the Submarine Channel. The site is built using animated GIFs and Flash 3. Yugop - 1999 When Yugo Nakamura unveiled his MONO*crafts site at yugop.com in 1999, it made an entire industry stop and draw a breath. One of the first designers to embrace and exploit the potential of ActionScript, Nakamura's interactive environments were very fluid, calming, and natural. Previously a gardener, he quotes an old Japanese saying: ‚ÄúRather than beautifying one‚Äôs own creation, make better the environment that surrounds it‚Äù ‚Äî in other words, better to make a beautiful user experience than a beautiful website. Built in Flash 4. Jonni Nitro - 1999 In 1999, Jonni Nitro was the most exciting animation on the Web. Centred on a female secret agent on a quest against an unnamed terrorist threat, Tubatomic's G-Woman took its visual cues from graphic novels like Frank Miller's Sin City. Using a highly stylised video-to-vector process, the animated series pushed Flash well beyond its apparent capabilities. Built in Flash 4. Barneys - 2000 Founded by Peter Kang and Gene Na in 1999, one of Kioken's early websites was for the R & B singer Brandy, and a string of entertainment clients followed, most notably including Jennifer Lopez, Motown, and Bad Boy Records. Criticized by some for a lack of usability, contrary to popular opinion, Kioken was resolute in its belief that audiences raised in the video game era were practiced in deciphering interfaces ‚Äî in fact, they took pleasure in the experience. Taking their cue from TV and video games, Kioken's websites had a depth and emotional quality absent from their counterparts. Full-bleed images, parallax movement, and floating palettes were used with great effect, all coming together beautifully on Barneys.com. According to Na, it's simple: ‚ÄúYou have to think beyond the limits of a page.‚Äù Built in Flash 4. Levi Twisted Denim - 2000 Lateral was founded in 1997 by Jon Bains and Simon Crab. Quickly joined by David Jones and David Hart, they were already digital veterans, having worked at Obsolete since 1994. Their first account was Levi's Europe, an account they retained for a decade. The Levi Twisted Denim site, twists the browser, opening multiple windows and creating a usability nightmare in the process. Bravo to them. Built in HTML 4.01, Director 8.0 (Shockwave), RealPlayer 4.0 PrayStation - 2000 Joshua Davis wanted to write and illustrate children's books. After his first two attempts received two rejection letters, a friend told him, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need them anymore ‚Äî there‚Äôs this whole internet thing happening. You can self- publish.‚Äù Davis went out and bought a book on HTML and changed the face of interactive design forever. PrayStation was Joshua Davis's sketchbook ‚Äî an experimental personal site of digital exploration, a place where success and failure were all documented, learned from and generously shared. Lessons weren't all that were given away: PrayStation was one of the first sites to provide its source files free. Fueled by his obsessive nature, the site evolved at an astonishing rate, and Davis built a devoted audience and a deserved reputation as the most exciting web designer on the planet. Built in Flash 4. MTV2 - 2000 MTV2's BAFTA award-winning website designed by Bradley Cho-Smith and Mickey Stretton and built by agency Digit and was known for marking the first time the creative started with the web and led the TV and print campaigns. It was built largely in Flash, and exploited multiple 3D-authoring tools like Vecta 3D, 3D Studio Max, and Swift 3D. The site's styling is draws inspiration from classic first-person shooter games like Doom or Quake, and there are more subtle culture references to classic video games and science-fiction movies throughout. One example being the rise of a faceted block that exits the screen in homage to the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars. Built in Flash 8, Vectra 3D, 3D Studio Max, Swift 3D. Requiem for a Dream - 2000 Hi-ReS! leapt onto our screens in 1999 following the launch of their experimental website soulbath.com, ‚Äúan exhibition of anti-banners.‚Äù Twelve million page views later, the site caught the attention of the film director Darren Aronofsky, and he gave founders Alexandra Jugovic and Florian Schmitt their first commercial project, building the website for his new film Requiem for a Dream. Like all Hi-ReS! film websites since, the result is much more than a trailer, it's a cinematic gem in its own right. Requiem for a Dream is about addiction, compulsion, and inevitable descent. The website investigates similar web-based behaviors, particularly online gambling and the ‚Äúmorbid patterns the medium is able to create in its users.‚Äù As the user descends deeper into the malfunctioning website, it gradually deteriorates and finally falls apart, ejecting the visitor in its death throes. Built in Flash 4. Bang & Olufsen - 2000 Bang & Olufsen's first global ecommerce site, created by Large Design, was described by the Financial Times as \\"the most beautiful site in the world\\". The site was updated monthly and drove users to store via a series of interactive product demonstrations that recreated the magic of B&O; products. The website uses PHP 3, HTML 4.0 and Flash 4. JAM: Tokyo-London - 2001 Airside was founded in 1998 by Fred Deakin, Nat Hunter and Alex Maclean. The playful style they became known for is perhaps best illustrated by the website they created for the Barbican exhibition JAM: Tokyo-London. The exhibition showcased the work of visual designers from both cities. Airside's website served as both the website for the show and an exhibit in its own right. A crowd of animated characters represented the exhibitors. Clicking on them revealed their work, choosing a discipline highlighted the appropriate characters in an entertaining way. Japanese designers danced on request, fashion designers removed their clothes. The site was nominated for a BAFTA. Built in Director 8.0 (Shockwave), HTML 4.01 Frost Design - 2002 The post dot-com world was a more serious place. Many agencies had gone out of business, those that hadn't, had a decade of experience to perfect their craft. Standards were higher. Born out of the ashes of Deepend in 2001, De-construct was one of the agencies that set those standards. Instead of reinventing communication design, they recognised its solid foundations and built on them. No site expressed this more clearly than the typographically driven site they created for Frost Design. Embraced by the entire design industry, it was this site that convinced many graphic design agencies to take the web more seriously. Built in Flash 5. Subservient Chicken - 2004 When ad agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky wanted its creation for Burger King brought to life online, it turned to long-term collaborator The Barbarian Group. Its response was to create an interactive video-based site that allowed visitors to control the chicken via their keyboards. Playing on transgressive webcam culture, more than 300 different clips were tagged with all manner of commands, and, a year before YouTube existed and six years before the Tipp-Ex bear, a much-imitated format was born.‚Äù. Built in Flash MX. Vodafone Future Vision - 2004 When Vodafone commissioned North Kingdom to develop a website that depicts a vision of the future of mobile communications, it did so with an open brief. North Kingdom was not only involved with the design and execution of the site, but it also collaborated on what the future might look like. And it did so with remarkable foresight, predicting the prevalence of geo-location technology, electronic paper, foldable screens, tablet devices, and the dominance of touch-screen interfaces, three years before the launch of the iPhone.‚Äù. Built in Flash MX. Gift Mixer 3000 - 2004 A hybrid of HAL 9000 and a mixing deck, Firstborn's Gift Mixer 3000 for Borders is Artificial Intelligence with a sense of humor, a ‚Äúliving, breathing, walking, talking, gift-matching machine.‚Äù. Built in Flash MX. IKEA Dream Kitchens - 2005 Forsman & Bodenfors's groundbreaking website for IKEA consists of six kitchens frozen in time and space. In one, a champagne bottle erupts and the bubbles hang in midair. In another, steam suspends inanimately above a frying pan. As visitors explore the 3D panoramic views of each kitchen, they are treated to Matrix- style special effects. Combining bullet time and kitchens is about as ambitious as it gets. The IKEA Dream Kitchen website is possibly the most awarded website of all time. Built in Flash 8.0 We Feel Fine - 2006 Constantly searching the web for new occurrences of the phrases ‚ÄúI feel‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am feeling‚Äù and recording the subsequent adjective, We Feel Fine is a barometer for the world's emotions. By categorizing these feelings by the age, gender, and location of the author and beautifully displaying the results as individual colored dots, the site becomes ‚Äúan artwork authored by everyone.‚Äù Are women more emotional than men? Do our feelings change as we age? Are people happier when the sun is shining? Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's We Feel Fine answers these questions through millions of individual stories yet reduces them to a data set, dehumanizing us and humanizing the machine in the process. Built in Java, Perl, Processing. Agent Provocateur - 2007 Large Design created a series of websites for Agent Provocateur between 2004 and 2007. They were cited in Vogue magazine as being the ‚Äúsexiest sites on the web.‚Äù Starring Maggie Gyllenhaal, the 2007 website was based on one of the most neglected areas of popular culture, the trashy novel. In the early twentieth century, pulp fiction was churned out in every imaginable genre, and their covers and titles were intense, exploitative, sexy, and graphic featuring some of the most provocative imagery of the time. McHarg reimagined this cover art for Agent Provocateur, retaining the intensity but ensuring women were portrayed in positions of strength. In the words of Joe Corr√©, ‚ÄúThe website does more than sell; it‚Äôs about telling a story, taking people on a personal adventure.‚Äù. Built in Flash 8, HTML 4.01, PHP 3. Unlimited - 2007 Long-term client Orange approached Poke to communicate the ‚ÄúUnlimited‚Äù message it was using to unify its mobile data and broadband offers. Poke's response was to build the world's first never-ending webpage ‚Äî one that visitors could never reach the bottom of. Even more impressive, the perpetually extending page is a rich collection of animations, mini-games, and interactive toys and appears to never repeat itself. This playful and sharable idea was also provocative, challenging people to try to ‚Äúbeat it,‚Äù some resting books on their keyboards overnight in the endeavor. Built in Flash CS3. HBO Voyeur - 2007 Voyeurism is part of human nature: We are fascinated by other people, and the web has given us the unchecked ability to spy on others without censure. The HBO Voyeur advertising campaign plays on this shared guilty pleasure. Created by BBDO to demonstrate the evolution of the HBO brand across multiple platforms, the campaign consisted of a four- minute film projected onto the side of an apartment block in New York and original content distributed across the social web. All held together by a highly sophisticated website developed by Big Spaceship, this master class in multichannel storytelling was the final nail in the coffin for the stand-alone 30-second ad.

The band was formed in the spring of 1989 in Laval, Quebec when vocalist Perry Blainey responded to an advertisement placed in the Montreal Gazette newspaper by bassist and keyboardist St√©phane Fania and guitarist Robert Kourie. Boize was associated with record label Aquarius Records and was managed by Canadian musician star and recording studio owner Bill Hill, under his music production company and management agency Bill Hill Productions. The band also had a brief association with South American heavy metal legend Alvacast, when singer Carlos \\"Charly\\" Lopez joined Boize as new vocalist in the fall of 1992. At its height, Boize headlined festivals around Quebec and was booked months in advance to perform several nights in a row at local Montreal music venues. Its music, including singles In Too Deep and Get a Life, was a staple on music television channels Musique Plus and MuchMusic and Montreal's top rock radio station CHOM-FM. The band members of Boize also founded their own independent music publishing company, Klink Publishing, and their own record label, U-Iliot Records, through which they marketed the band's recordings and collected royalties, even over the span of their success and dealings with major record labels. Both companies are still active to this day, though they are now solely owned and operated by founding member St√©phane Fania, who has re-issued Boize's entire catalog digitally along with a selection of previously unreleased material. Boize's momentum ended prematurely in the summer of 1993 following a heavy rotation of vocalists. After the departure of original singer Perry Blainey in the fall of 1992, the band performed with three different vocalists over the next nine months and ultimately decided to change the band's name to Emissary. Under the new name, the band's sound changed considerably and never achieved the same level of success. History Foundation (1986-1989) Boize was founded by Floyd Harem (Robert Kourie) on guitar and Zany Shultz (Stephane Fania) on bass in 1989. They had been making music together since 1986, including the band Unmarked/Alter-Ego from the summer of 1987 to September 1988 and Leading Edge/Strike Anywhere from late 1988 to March 1989. Some of the material written with Suzanne Madden as vocalist in Leading Edge/Strike Anywhere would evolve to become the earliest Boize material when Fyia Powers (Perry Blainey, an Ozzy Osbourne type) joined in April 1989 as the vocalist. They recorded their first \\"rehearsal demo\\" in June 1989 and later in the year, re-recorded the same five songs at Studio Works for their original demo. \\"The Bug\\" was released in October 1989 and as they had no drummer, Steph also programmed a drum machine while recording the keyboard parts. After shopping around the demo, they landed their first TV interview in November 1989 on a late night talk show Zone Rouge. That December, Boize were scheduled to play their first show at L'Intro but it had to be cancelled because they couldn't find a drummer in time. Expanding the band & record label interest (1990-1991) In January 1990, Boize posted an add in The Gazette to find a drummer. After some auditions, Siegfried (Scott MacDonald) was chosen to replace the drum machine. A month later Zorba (Victor Ananian), a high school friend of Steph joined as keyboardist. The band then moved its jam space from Bob's basement to a rehearsal room at 750 Cremazie Ouest, right above Trophy's Sports Bar. It wasn't long before they played their first show with this line-up at L'Intro on April 2, 1990. However Zorba couldn't stay in the band and left later that month. But they did expand to a second guitarist with Pascal Trahan after Perry suggested the guitarist from his previous band. With a rhythm guitarist for their concerts, this line-up played their second show, also at L'Intro, on May 26, 1990, with nearly an hour and a half's worth of original material. From its early inception, the band refused to play covers and stuck to only playing their own songs. During this second show, they announced that they were raising money in order to record their first full-length album. In June 1990, they played a five-song set for a label showcase at the Backstreet, but things didn't turn out in their favor. Instead the band signed with Imagination Records for an album releasing contract. That fall Boize began recording at Cherry Studio with the Stocola brothers for their planned first album. Meanwhile, they played a couple more shows, one at Jackie's Cafe, another at Whiskey's and several at Sam's Rock Bar. In September they moved out of their rehearsal space on Cremazie because the noise level was so bad and temporarily jammed back in Bob's basement. By November they had recorded nine songs, but the label's plans had changed and Boize were forced to legally break their contract with them. In December, Boize was booked to play all the holiday shows at Sam's Rock Bar. Starting with December 23, 1990 for the Christmas show, with Barfly and then the 30th and 31st, the first again with Barfly and the second with Red Tape, for the new year celebration. In January 1991, Boize asked Pascal to become a permanent member of the band, but he was already working on his own new band, Les Diables a Quatre, which he was beginning to do full-time. Now as a four piece, Boize found a new rehearsal room in Sam's Rock Bar's basement, which had recently been divided into jam spaces. Boize were the first band to practice there and would really make a home of the venue for the next year and a half. The new year proved to be filled with good luck as they were quickly picked up by Bill Hill Productions in mid January and he immediately took them to Morris Apelbaum's Silent Sound Studio to rework the Cherry Studio material. There they did some vocal re-dubs and attempted to re-mix some of the poorly recorded material but it wasn't happening. In February Bill decided to try at a different studio so they went to Frank Marino's Starbase Studio. There they re-recorded some of the drums and guitars and also recorded a tenth song, \\"In Too Deep\\", featuring Kim and Dorian Sherwood. Bill insisted that Boize record this new song because he intended for it to be their first single, with a plan to press it on maxi CD singles, make a video for it and ship it off to the TV and radio stations. With some newly recorded and polished up material, the immediate plan to release the full-length was dropped and instead, four songs were selected to be used on a promo tape, titled \\"I'll Still Love You\\", to send to the majors. When the promo tape came out in March 1991, a lot of promotion started for Boize and they were invited to be interviewed by Tootall on CHOM-FM's hit show \\"Made in Canada\\" on May 15, 1991. During the interview, Tootall played three of the four songs from the promo tape. In April 1991, Boize founded their own publishing company, Klink Publishing. The classic line-up & mainstream appeal (1991-1992) Boize would play their next show on May 18 at Sam's Rock Bar where they met a new fan, Steve Bahr (Steve Berger aka Minou), who would show immediate interest in becoming their new rhythm guitar player. It would take the band a few more shows and practices before being convinced that a second guitar player was the way to go. Steve officially joined in the late summer of 1991. With dual guitarists, Boize started writing heavier material and quickly gained a reputation as a local attraction in the clubs and their following was growing steadily. In October 1991 Bill Hill and his assistant Garfield Lamb offered Boize a recording deal for an EP which would come to life the 1991-1992 winter. In January 1992, Boize entered Mot-tel Studio to record for the fifth time. The self-titled Boize EP was released on their own record label, U-Iliot Records, published through Klink Publishing and was their first nationally distributed release. The promotional package included 5000 cassette tapes, 500 CDs, 5000 posters and several hundred T-shirts, hats and stickers. Boize also filmed a music video for \\"Get a Life\\" at the Backstreet, one of their most frequently played venue. For this, the club was opened on a usually closed Tuesday night and filled to maximum capacity. They hired Martin Tanguay and Andy Molition to direct and edit the short film. Additionally, they hired Judith Cezar and Keith Marshall for a full shooting of promotional pictures, some would be used in the EP booklet, another for their poster and some for press kits. The EP was released on April 21, 1992 with a huge party at Sam's Rock Bar where the video aired for the first time. It was then sent to Musique Plus and MuchMusic where it would play countless times during the year. The day after the release party, Boize were invited again by Tootall on CHOM-FM's \\"Made in Canada\\" to talk about their new release and four of the five songs from the EP were aired during the show. CHOM continued playing Boize and they were picked up by CKRK-FM and CIBL-FM as well. In early May 1992, Scott gave an exclusive interview to Mick Cody for his June 1992 publication of Ace Magazine, which also featured an album review The May 28th 1992 issue of Montreal Mirror magazine had a write-up on the band's new EP, written by none other than Jenny Ross in her column \\"Notes From Underground\\". With all this hype, the band needed more space and moved their jam room to 5980 Metropolitan East, above a ceramic store. This new rehearsal space allowed the band to set up a mini recording studio where they could track their progress. On May 30 Boize played with National Velvet at the Backstreet and from then on, national distribution deals started being offered (including a serious offer from Aquarius Records). Boize was becoming a staple name in Canadian heavy metal and were booked almost constantly all around Montreal clubs. On August 15 and 16 1992, Boize was invited to headline the Montmagny Festival (Exposition Regionale de Montmagny) on its last two dates of the week-long festival. To promote the band's coming, some of the local restaurants printed their menus with the band's picture and the show dates. Whatever was left of the merchandise pressed for the EP was sold out during those two shows. After headlining the festival, Aquarius Records was even more anxious to sign the band and attempted to set up a meeting in late September. During September, the band would again move their jamming space to 5678 Jarry East, this time in a strip mall where they would remain until the end. Boize would book a handful of shows through September and October, starting with Bar Chez Swann on September 12, a three-day headline at Sam's Rock Bar from the 17 to the 19, plus another on the 26, the Backstreet again on October 3 and more offers coming in. Unfortunately, Perry announced his desire to leave the band after the show at Bar Chez Swann which led to most of the Sam's Rock Bar shows being cancelled. The band was not ready to give up and, not wanting to cancel more of the shows that were booked, placed an ad in the Gazette looking for a new vocalist. They quickly found Carlos \\"Charly\\" Lopez (a Bruce Dickinson type), who had recently moved to Montreal from Uruguay. Back home, Charly was famous as the vocalist for the band Alvacast, who were the South American equivalent to Iron Maiden. On September 27, 1992, to celebrate the new addition to the band, Boize went to play a cover of Iron Maiden's \\"Run to the Hills\\" at local club Rockpile. The fans approved right away. The five shows that were booked for that October, including the Backstreet, Fuzzy's and a 3-night stint at bar L'Enfer in Sherbrooke, were a huge success. Their last night in Sherbrooke, the crowd cheered so loud that they were asked to play their entire set a second time as an encore until 3 a.m. when the bar closed. Bill Hill and Gralf Lamb were interested in getting the band back in studio, in hope to finalize the Aquarius Records deal. Steph had already set up their new jam space on Jarry with their mini studio and began recording their rehearsals. In November they provided Bill with a tape of two new songs they had written along with the songs from the self-titled EP re-recorded with Charly on vocals, all recorded live in the rehearsal. On December 5, Steve left the band to go live in Gaspesie and get married, but the four other members were brought back to Starbase Studio to do overdubs. Bill and Gralf used the February 1991 DATs of \\"In Too Deep\\" and had Charly sing his version over it. Before anything could be done with the new recordings, Alvacast decided to get back together, with the other members now living in Montreal as well. Charly left Boize before the years' end. The decline of Boize & changing name to Emissary (1993) Steph, Bob and Scott decided to try once more and held vocalist auditions, to find Ian (a Robert Plant-styled signer who also played acoustic twelve-string guitar). He seemed a perfect match to complete the band for the new year, and they spent the next two months reworking the two new songs that were written with Charly and write a few new ones. To showcase the new line-up, Boize was invited to play a benefit concert for Claude Messier on March 20, 1993 in support for his fight against muscular dystonia. Immediately after this they booked half a dozen shows for their first tour, which would have taken them through eastern Quebec during mid- April. Ian's leading man skills were completely different from Perry's or Charly's and the difference became apparent at their next concert at the Backstreet on April 2. To start off their second set, Boize asked Charly, who was in the audience with fellow Alvacast bandmates, to join them on stage for an Iron Maiden cover. The crowd went wild and for a reason or another Ian didn't come back on stage and left the venue, leaving Charly to finish the rest of show. This caused serious tension within the band and resulted in Scott quitting during the second week of April 1993. The tour was so close to happening that the tickets had already been printed, but it had to be canceled. The trio continued jamming together for the next few weeks but by May, Ian's inflated ego was getting to be too much and he was kicked out of the band. Determined to continue the Boize name, Steph and Bob recruited Andr√© Chan who was at the time also playing drums for Cinema Five/Likwid. This trio had a few rehearsals, but things weren't the same and Andre left. They then recruited Joe Morrone to play drums, a local musician who had grown up in the same area of Montreal as Steph. Boize were still booked for a show in May 1993 at Les Retrouvailles and asked Charly to fill in again for that night, as he had received such success at the last Backstreet show. Following this show, Steph, Bob and Joe found ex-Sarok Saroya singer Rjeen (Xavier Briand, an Elvis Presley type) in June 1993. The last Boize songs were rehashed with completely new lyrics that fitted Rjeen's wide vocal range and before the month was over, they decided to abandon the \\"Boize\\" moniker and go under \\"Emissary\\". The songs written in 1993 as Boize were released on the Emissary EP in August 1993 and the band lasted until February 1996, at which point they changed name to \\"Breaking Violet\\" and stayed active until early 1999.

He is best known for his expressionist paintings and drawings, and for his contributions to the local avantgarde magazine Zenit. He showed his work in many solo and group exhibitions in Croatia and abroad. In the Zagreb Spring Salon of the 1920s, he participated with Milivoj Uzelac, Marijan Trep≈°e and Vladimir Varlaj, who together were known as the \\"Group of Four\\" or \\"The Prague Four\\". Trained in Prague, works of these young painters brought new expressionist ideas that went on to dominate the 1920s Croatian art scene. Vilko Gecan is considered one of the masters of early Croatian expressionism. Two retrospective exhibitions of his work were organized during Gecan‚Äôs lifetime, and a large posthumous exhibition was held in 2005 at the Art Pavilion in Zagreb. Gecan received the Vladimir Nazor Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1967. Biography Vilko Gecan was born 16 June 1894 in Ku≈æelj near Brod na Kupi. In 1899 he travelled with his parents to Australia, returning to Croatia again in 1902. He attended school in Karlovac, Glogovnici, Zagreb, Dubica, and from 1910 the gymnasium in Banja Luka, where he met Milivoj Uzelac, with whom he developed a strong friendship that was to last throughout his life. In 1912-13, they both attended the private art school in Zagreb of Tomislav Krizman. In the autumn of 1913 Gecan moved to Munich, where he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, as well as Heymann's private painting school. At the beginning of the First World War, Gecan was drafted. At the Battle of Soƒçi in July 1915, he was captured and spent the rest of the war in prisoner-of war camps on Sicily. In 1919, he went to Prague with Milivoj Uzelac. That same year, they exhibited at the Zagreb Spring Salon, and later as part of the Group of Four (Gecan, Trep≈°e, Uzelac, Varlaj). In 1921 Gecan held his first solo exhibition at the Art Pavilion. In 1922 he went to Berlin, where he studied stained glass techniques, and in 1924-28 he spent time in the United States (New York, Chicago). While there, he attended exhibitions of modern art, seeing the works of C√©zanne and Picasso. In 1928, he stayed for a brief time in Paris with Uzelac. By 1931, Gecan experienced the first symptoms of Parkinson's disease, a tremor in his right hand that would become stronger, increasingly hindering his ability to paint. In 1932, he returned to Zagreb, where he organized a solo exhibition in the Salon Ulrich. In 1935, aged 41, he enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts, Zagreb, in order to formally earn his academic degree. In 1964, a retrospective of his work was held at the Modern Gallery in Zagreb. In 1967 he received the Vladimir Nazor Award for lifetime achievement. In 1972, a further retrospective of Gecan's work was held at the Art Pavilion. Vilko Gecan died on 25 June 1973 in Zagreb.  Legacy  In the autumn of 1919, Gecan moved to Prague, joining Milivoj Uzelac, Vladimir Varlaj, Marijan Trep≈°e, Ivo Re≈æek and Frano Kr≈°iniƒá. Together they made the city an important reference for Croatian modern art. There, they picked up the new ideas of secessionism and expressionism, which they brought back to Croatian art. Gecan's most important works were produced in the 1920s and 1930s. By 1921 the beginnings of expressionism were evident in his paintings and drawings. Miroslav Kraljeviƒá's legacy shows in the Klinik (Clinic) cycle, where cubism combined with realism and intense colour. His later work tended to be calmer, with less tension, more art deco stylization. Gecan's early work shows free movement and the character stylization that would develop into his signature style. It is known that the first exhibition of Miroslav Kraljeviƒá's work in 1912 at the Ulrich Gallery in Zagreb had a significant impact on both Gecan and Uzelac. Gecan continued his education in Munich in 1913, where he broadened his artistic horizons. Gecan's war experience in prisoner-of-war camps had a lasting effect on him. His \\"Clinic\\" cycle of 1920, considered a masterpiece of Croatian expressionism, was based on a clinic in Prague, where Gecan was treated for kidney disease. But the paintings depict something closer to a mental hospital with dark characterisations, unsettling black and white rhythms, strange elongated figures, - enclosed spaces with strange characters trapped in them. His experiences in the camps permeated are key to understanding his paintings over the next few years. His uses of visual tension creates a state of anxiety. The Cynic (Cinik), 1921 At the Spring Salon of 1921, Gecan exhibited the painting \\"Cinik\\" (The Cynic), which is now considered the most important work of Croatian Expressionist painting. This image derives from cubist and expressionist styles, symbolizing the world as a stage, and marked deformation of character. A young man in a red suit and bow tie sits at an oversized table with a shifted perspective that is tilted towards the viewer. He is reading Der Sturm, a newspaper that was known to promote expressionist art. The man in the picture is Gecan himself, who at the time was 27 years old. He looks cramped and awkward, the body language suggesting some inner turmoil, while the facial expression is a grimace. Gecan's later paintings show a broader understanding of style and echoes of cubism, specifically the stylization of art deco. Unfortunately, his artistic development slowed as the symptoms of Parkinson's disease took hold. After spending some years in the United States, his work became softer, with a more conventional realism, and he created many still lifes and landscapes.

In his first term in office, Burns ran as a clean elections candidate and served on the Taxation Committee. He earned a B.A. in Business Administration from Concordia University Texas. He served 20 years in the United States Army. On November 30, 2011, the Maine Ethics Commission ruled that Burns broke campaign finance rules during his 2010 campaign. The ethics commission declared that Burns owed more than $2,000 for violating state law regarding the use of public funds, including the co- mingling of personal and campaign funds, the falsifying of documents and other chargers of malfeasance. The commission also asked Maine Attorney General William Schneider to open a criminal investigation and impose a large fine for the violations which Commission chair Walter McKee called \\"mind-boggling\\". On January 31, 2012, Burns resigned from the Maine House of Representatives following an investigation by the Maine Attorney General.

In particular, the goal of this therapeutic approach is to acknowledge that individual symptoms are not unique, but rather shared by people similarly oppressed and marginalized. Ultimately, the psychotherapy and social action model aims to aid clients in overcoming mental illness through personal psychotherapy, group coping, and collective social action. Background The psychotherapy and social action model was initially proposed by Sue Holland, a psychotherapist with a background in community action. Holland developed this framework in 1980 following her experience working with women coping with psychological disorders at a housing estate in West London.Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher & P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge At this estate, Holland observed the psychological difficulties experienced by women, noticing that their mental health was fundamentally tied to the social and economic obstacles they encountered as females in their society. In addition, Holland took issue with the way Depression (mood) was being treated at the shelter, believing that individualized treatment, especially with the use of psychotropic medication, was not successfully addressing the root of the dysfunction for these women. Instead, Holland posited a pathway from individual treatment to sociopolitical action that empowered women to deal with their mental dysfunction both privately and socially. As such, the psychotherapy and social action model is rooted in the ideals of both traditional psychotherapy and feminist empowerment. Implementation of the model began with a three-year trial run and, according to Holland (1992), achieved its three initial goals, including providing private focused psychotherapy, promoting mental health, and fostering community continuity. There was initial evidence supporting the efficacy of the model in treating individual psychological dysfunction.Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher & P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge The model The square model derives from the sociological theory of the four paradigms for the analysis of social theory.Burrell, G. & Morgan, G. (1979). Sociological Paradigms and Organisational Analysis. London: Heinemann Outside the frame of the model, the dichotomy of individual versus social approaches to personal well-being is represented. The two bottom cells of the square delineate the changing of individuals to conform to social convention while the two top cells of the square represent the changing of social structures as opposed to the individual.Orford, J. (2008). Community Psychology: challenges, controversies and emerging consensus (Illustrated ed.). London: John Wiley and Sons. The four cells within the frame represent the four paradigms of social theory including functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist, and radical structuralist paradigms. Functionalism here is rooted in regulation and objective thinking, and represents the individual, status-quo approach to mental health. The interpretive paradigm is characterized by an approach to understanding the social world through subjective experience, and represents psychoeducation within the psychotherapy framework. The radical humanist paradigm is defined by a radial approach to change with an emphasis on \\"transcending limitations of existing social arrangements.\\" (Burrell & Morgan, 1979, p. 32). With respect to an approach to therapy, this stage is characterized by the adoption of a social self, such that healing occurs at a group or collective level. The radical structuralist paradigm concentrates on radical change through political or economic emancipation. This is the endpoint of therapy, at which time the client is empowered to challenge sociopolitical structures that foster the conditions perpetuating the manifestation of individual mental illness within an oppressed group. Taken from her 1992 publication entitled, \\"From Social Abuse to Social Action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women,\\" Holland formulated her four step approach to mental health and social action for women in treatment for depression as follows:Holland, S. (1992). From social abuse to social action: a neighborhood psychotherapy and social action project for women. In J. Ussher & P. Nicholson (eds), Gender Issues in Clinical Psychology. London: Routledge I. Patient on pills At this stage, patients endorse the status-quo characterization of the \\"individualized patient.\\" As such, they treat their disorder passively with psychotropic medication and accept the label associated with their illness. II. Person- to-person psychotherapy This stage represents the first alternative to the status-quo treatment of psychiatric disorders: talk therapy. At this stage, clients and therapists are able to explore the meaning of their psychopathology and pinpoint the potential causes through individual therapy. III. Talking in groups At this stage, the client is able to move past the personal challenges that are acknowledged and addressed in psychotherapy and discover that the challenges are universal amongst similarly marginalized individuals. Together, clients aim to acknowledge what is best for the collective. IV. Taking action The final stage, as the name suggests, is the point at which the collective mobilizes to change the social structures enabling their common oppression. Having changed from an individual to a collective, the clients should feel empowered to undertake social change. Included in this framework is the assumption that only some of the clients in this therapy will traverse all three stages. In Holland's words, \\"‚Ä¶many will be content enough with the relief from symptoms and the freedom to get on with their personal lives which the individual therapy gives them.\\" (Holland, 1992, p. 73). Thus, this framework is fluid based on the personal inclinations of the client throughout the therapeutic process.

The end result is list of actions needed to achieve the desired results. Beyond groupthink Sally Fuller and Ramon Aldag argue that group decision-making models have been operating under too narrow of a focus due to the overemphasis of the groupthink phenomenon. In addition, according to them, group decision-making has often been framed in relative isolation, ignoring context and real-world circumstances, which is a likely consequence of testing group decision-making in laboratory studies. They claim that the groupthink model is overly deterministic and an unrealistically restrictive depiction of the group problem-solving process.‚Äù To address these problems, they propose a new model that incorporates elements of group decision-making processes from a broader, more comprehensive perspective, offering a more general and generalizable framework for future research. The model includes elements of Irving Janis's original model (1977), but only those that have been consistently supported by the literature. To understand the differences between the two models, we briefly summarize both Janis's model and the GGPS-model first. The original groupthink model Janis defines groupthink as ‚Äúthe mode of thinking that persons engage in when concurrence-seeking becomes so dominant in a cohesive in-group that it tends to over-ride realistic appraisals of alternative courses of action.‚Äù In a subsequent article, he elaborates on this by saying: ‚ÄúI use the term \\"groupthink\\" as a quick and easy way to refer to a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action. Groupthink refers to a deterioration of mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment that results from in-group pressures.‚Äù All this suggests that the original groupthink model was proposed for a rather specific situation, and Janis states that we can only call a phenomenon groupthink if all the warning signs are present (see groupthink symptoms). Groupthink schematic The GGPS-model The GGPS-model (developed by Ramon Aldag and Sally Fuller) broadens the perspectives, incorporating elements of the original groupthink model, in a fashion that creates a more widely applicable schematic. Two key differences should be noted in comparison to Janis‚Äô model: # The GGPS model presents elements of the group problem-solving process in a value-neutral manner. The groupthink model is restrictive and deterministic in the sense that numerous elements are phrased to suggest that certain aspects of the process are pathological, such as ‚Äùtoo few alternatives‚Äù. The GGPS model suggests no such assumptions in its terms, and recasts this term as ‚Äùnumber of alternatives‚Äù. # Fuller and Aldag argue that a comprehensive model has to reflect the political environment of the real world and real workplaces. Thus, the GGPS model considers a larger set of antecedents than the groupthink model, among these are group type, leader power, organizational political norms etc. Ggps schematic Elements of the GGPS model =Antecedents= Three sets of antecedents are proposed by GGPS: decision characteristics, group structure and decision-making context. Decision characteristics Elements belonging here are the importance of the decision, time pressure, structure, procedural requirements, and task characteristics. Examples: whether the task is simple or complex will make a substantial difference in required member input, as well as in whether a directive leader is necessary. Group interaction is also altered if, given a task, a single correct answer exists and if it becomes obvious to any of the members, since subsequent group interaction will likely be reduced. Group structure Elements are cohesiveness, members‚Äô homogeneity, insulation of the group, leader impartiality, leader power, history of the group, probability of future interaction, stage of group development and type of group. Examples: whether group members anticipate to work together again in the future can have a major impact on to what degree can political motives influence the process. If it's unlikely that the group will come together again, political influence can be lessened. Stage of group development is important because members of mature group with a long history may feel more comfortable challenging each other's ideas, thus cohesiveness results in quality decision making and positive outcomes. Decision making context Elements are organizational political norms, member political motives, prior discussion of issue, prior goal attainment, goal definition, and degree of stress from external threat. Examples: whether group members identified and pursue a unitary goal or they have multiple, discrepant goals influences the rationality of the decision- making process. Members‚Äô political motives also make a tremendous difference, if individuals have a vested interest in certain outcomes, or there are one or more coalitions present, behavior in the decision making process could be altered. =Emergent group characteristics= The model differentiates two categories of emergent group characteristics: group perceptions and processes. Group Perceptions These include members‚Äô perceptions of the group's vulnerability, the inherent morality of the group, member unanimity, and views of opposing groups. Group Processes These include the group's response to negative feedback, treatment of dissenters, self-censorship, and use of mindguards. =Decision process characteristics= Decision process characteristics are grouped in terms of the first three stages of group problem-solving processes: problem identification, alternative generation and evaluation and choice. Implementation and control stages are not included because they follow the actual decision, but some variables preparing for those stages are indeed included (e.g. development of contingency plans and gathering of control-related information). Problem identification Elements of this stage are predecisional information search, survey of objectives, and explicit problem definition. Example: if members of the group fail to explicitly or correctly define the problem, there is a chance that they will solve the wrong problem. Alternative generation Elements are number of alternatives and quality of alternatives. Example: in generating alternatives, it's important to differentiate quality and quantity of alternative ideas generated. Some group processes, such as brainstorming, are directed towards generating large numbers of ideas, with the assumption that it will lead to a superior alternative. Defective processes, on the other hand, might lead to large numbers of low quality ideas. Evaluation and choice Elements are information processing quality, the source of the initial selection of a preferred alternative, emergence of preferred alternative, group decision rule, timing of convergence, reexamination of preferred and rejected alternatives, source of the final solution, development of contingency plans, and gathering of control-related information. Example: whether the group decides based on a majority rule or a consensus has to be reached, makes a great difference in the process. If a consensus is to be reached, dissent could be discouraged, because dissenters could elongate and jeopardize the process. With a majority rule, dissent is more acceptable. =Outcomes= The GGPS model includes an array of decision, political and affective outcomes. Decision outcomes: include acceptance of the decision by those affected by it and/or those who have to implement it, adherence to the decision, implementation success, and decision quality. Example: if the leader of the group is not satisfied with the decision, he/she might unilaterally reverse it. Political outcomes: include future motivation of the leader, future motivation of the group and future use of the group. Example: if the outcome did not satisfy the political agenda of the leader, he/she might use the group less or not at all in the future. Affective outcomes: include satisfaction with the leader, satisfaction with the group process and satisfaction with the decision. Example: whether members are content with the fairness of the group process, whether trust was developed and preserved, or whether commitment to the decision is strong will greatly influence the group's future functioning.

Oakwood Heights is the smaller of the two neighborhoods and borders Melvindale to the south and the city of Dearborn to the northwest. The two neighborhoods are connected to the rest of the city of Detroit by two bridges across Interstate 75 and Fort Street (formerly known as U.S. Route 25) connecting to the neighborhood of Carbon Works, which lead to the neighborhoods of Springwells and Delray. Dix Avenue also crosses the river to connect Oakwood Heights to Dearborn. Oakwood Heights also connects to Fordson Island in the River Rouge via Riverside Drive. Fordson Island is part of the city of Dearborn and has no public access or residents. Despite the heavy industrialization, several parks exist within the area. Kemeny Park, located along Fort Street in between I-75, is the largest recreation facility. The park opened in 1957 and was named after local resident Charles Kemeny, who died in combat in World War II. The park closed in 2015 but was reopened in 2018 after a $9.5 million renovation‚Äî$2 million of which was donated by the nearby Marathon Petroleum Corporation. Demographics According to data from the 2010 census, the areas of Boynton‚ÄìOakwood Heights had 8,832 residents and 3,126 occupied households for an average density of . There were 716 vacant units. According to 2009 estimates, the racial makeup of the two neighborhoods was 10.38% White, 74.80% African American, 0.67% Native American, 0.46% Asian, 0.10% Pacific Islander, 0.01% from other races, and 2.60% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 10.94% of the population. 2009 estimates were off significantly from official counts later recorded at the 2010 census. While there was estimated to be 12,129 residents in 2009, the census officially accounted for only 8,832. The majority of the population lives in Boynton. The median income for a household in these neighborhoods was $26,316, and the median income for a family was $28,789. About 27.3% of the population was below the poverty line. Transportation Interstate 75, known locally as the Fisher Freeway, runs north‚Äìsouth through the Boynton and Oakwood Heights neighborhoods and has two exits: Outer Drive (#42) and Schaefer Highway (#43). Outer Drive represents the southernmost border of the Boynton neighborhood and the southernmost city limit of Detroit with Lincoln Park. The Schaefer Highway (also referred to as Coolidge Highway at various points along its route) runs northwest through the neighborhoods, beginning just east in the city of River Rouge and running north all the way to the city of Rochester Hills. Fort Street (formerly U.S. Route 25) runs north‚Äìsouth through the middle of the neighborhoods, passes under Interstate 75, and crosses the River Rouge leading into Downtown Detroit. Several Norfolk Southern Railway lines runs through the Oakwood Heights section. The Detroit Department of Transportation operates three bus routes through Boynton and Oakwood Heights. Route #41 travels along Schaefer Highway from the city of River Rouge at Jefferson Avenue, through parts of Dearborn, and to the northern limits of Detroit at 8 Mile Road at the city of Oak Park. Route #19 travels from Outer Drive along Fort Street to Downtown Detroit. Route #89 is a part-time route that runs along Bassett Street from Outer Drive along the border with the city of River Rouge, turns on Schaefer Highway, enters the Fisher Freeway, crosses the river, and meanders into the New Center district. Oakwood Heights has one property listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Fort Street‚ÄìPleasant Street and Norfolk & Western Railroad Viaduct, which was constructed in 1928. The bridge carries six lanes of Fort Street over Pleasant Street and four Norfolk Southern Railway lines before crossing the River Rouge.

Located at 12800 Visger Street, Mark Twain School for Scholars (sometimes referred to as Mark Twain Elementary‚ÄìMiddle School) is the only public school located within the Boynton‚ÄìOakwood Heights neighborhoods. Formerly known as the Frances G. Boynton School, it was built in 1926. The school served 220 students for the 2017‚Äì18 school year‚Äîdown 23 students (9.5%) from the previous school year. Of the 220 students, there were 199 (90.5%) African Americans, 17 (7.7%) Hispanics, and four (1.8%) Caucasians. The only other school located within these neighborhoods was the Pierre Toussaint Academy, which was a charter school located at 2450 South Beatrice Street in Boynton. Managed by The Leona Group, the academy opened for the 1998‚Äì99 school year and enrolled around 400 students at one time before closing due to academic viability at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 school year on June 30, 2012. While the two neighborhoods contain no public libraries, the nearest Detroit Public Library is the Campbell Branch at 8733 West Vernor Highway just north in the Springwells neighborhood. Also, the Lincoln Park Public Library is about one mile south of Boynton at 1381 Southfield Road in Lincoln Park. Industry Marathon Petroleum Company LP is the largest facility within the Oakwood Heights neighborhood. Southwest Detroit contains heavy industrial development, and this has reportedly raised health concerns for some residents living in Boynton and Oakwood Heights. In February 2019, the Detroit Metro Times reported that the remaining 7,000 residents in the neighborhoods have a higher rate of asthma and cancer than most of the country. While at least 14 states regulate and prohibit how close industries can build to schools and residential zones, Michigan does not have such regulations. Long ago, the city zoned its southwest area for heavy industrial use despite preexisting residential communities. Air pollution in Boynton and Oakwood Heights has reportedly led to respiratory diseases and cancer cases in long-term residents. In an article published by the Detroit Free Press in June 2010, they reported, \\"For the past six months, a rain of mysterious sparkly dust of unknown origin has landed on their homes and gardens. Odd odors and clouds of dark particles float overhead.\\" This dust pollution has been shown to contain high levels of harmful metals, such as lead, that can be harmful to the health of long-term residents. Even the soil may be unsuitable for growing gardens. The Detroit Free Press stated that the 48217 ZIP Code‚Äîoccupied solely by Boynton and Oakwood Heights‚Äîis \\"Michigan's most polluted [ZIP Code], according to analysis by environmental scientists from the University of Michigan.\\" Halting the growing industries could discourage job growth, and the state continues to issue permits for heavy industries. Industries comply with both state and federal regulations. However, the number of industries proximate to the neighborhoods has a cumulative effect. Heavy traffic and railroads have also increased air pollution, as do numerous other large industries outside of the neighborhoods. Among these industries, the Detroit Wastewater Treatment Plant on the other side of the river and the U.S. Steel facility on Zug Island in the city of River Rouge further add to the poor air quality in the area. Marathon Petroleum Corporation The largest of these industries is the Marathon Petroleum Company LP refinery located at 301 South Fort Street in Oakwood Heights. The facility was originally built in 1930 by the Aurora Gasoline Company. Today, the expanded facility is the only petroleum refinery in Michigan, and it has a capacity of 140,000 barrels per day and around 540 employees. The refinery received the Energy Star Award in 2007 and 2008 from the Environmental Protection Agency for reducing energy usage and protecting the environment through energy efficiency. The refinery has added green space around its facility, although it is still viewed negatively by the surrounding communities. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has issued 13 violations to the facility since 2013 and at least three fines, especially after a massive cloud of burned petroleum coke blanketed the area and blew into neighboring Windsor on July 27, 2013. In February 2019, a malfunctioning flare from the facility released \\"horrific, stomach churning odors\\" that forced some residents to stay indoors. In response to the growing criticism, Jamal T. Kheiry, communications manager for Marathon, wrote, \\"Over the past 20 years, we have reduced our emissions more than 75 percent, and the refinery comprises only three percent of the emissions in this heavily industrialized area of Southwest Detroit.\\" The refinery has received permission for an expansion of its facilities and has sought to buy out properties in the Oakwood Heights community. It remains unclear if Marathon would actually expand into the area or if they are just buying out nearby properties to create a larger buffer from the remaining communities in order to avoid further complaints. The neighborhood of Oakwood Heights once contained about 500 homes, but large areas and entire blocks have been bought out and demolished. Many local residents welcomed the buyout as a means to leave the area. Marathon offered 350 homeowners buyout packages totaling nearly $60,000 per home in the Oakwood Heights community, even though some homes were valued at much less. A similar offer was requested but not granted to the Boynton community, which has few major industries itself and is mostly separated from the facility by Interstate 75 and Fort Street. Not all residents have accepted Marathon's offer, as the company cannot force residents to move out. Those residents that have stayed are growing concerned that the empty space and general neglect of the neighborhood will increase crime. Feeling Oakwood Heights has become abandoned, some have complained that local police have become unresponsive to their calls.

The beginnings  In the first years after Henry Hudson sailed up the river in 1609 and claimed the area for the Dutch East India Company and the government of the Republic of the Seven United Provinces, there was no real New Netherlands government and judicial system. The inhabitants of the small trading community of Manhattan Island as well as the members of the crew of the ships that came to the area, were subject to the rule of their captains.Jaap Jacobs, Een zegenrijk gewest ‚Äì Nieuw-Nederland in de zeventiende eeuw, Amsterdam: Uitgeverij Prometheus/Bert Bakker 1999, , p. 105. When the Dutch West India Company (WIC) was founded in 1621, the Dutch presence in America intensified and the States General charged the WIC to set up the appropriate forms of governance and judicial control.Eben Moglen, Settling the law: legal development in provincial New York, 1994, p. 2.  Early New Amsterdam governance and judiciary: the WIC  The city of New Amsterdam started as a purely commercial colony, mainly inhabited by employees of the WIC. Governance and adjudication was a matter of WIC control. In 1623 the first colonists, 30 Walloon families, came to New Netherlands. Willem Verhulst was one of the first local directors. He soon came into conflict with the colonists and Peter Minuit replaced him as a director in 1626.Jacobs (1999), p. 110-112. See also James Sullivan, History of New York State 1523-1927, Online book of the Historical Society of the Courts of the State of New York: http://www.courts.state.ny.us/history/elecbook/sullivan/pg1.htm The New Amsterdam director and his council exercised legislative, administrative and judicial powers, subject to review by the WIC‚Äôs Amsterdam Chamber, and finally the States General in the Republic of the United Provinces.James Sullivan, History of New York State 1523-1927, Online book of the Historical Society of the Courts of the State of New York: http://www.courts.state.ny.us/history/elecbook/sullivan/pg1.htm The applicable law was at first a mixture of the law of the sea and the regular law of the Republic of the United Provinces, and it would slowly become entirely similar to the law of the Republic of the United Provinces.Jacobs, (1999), p. 110-111.  Next step: Patroonships  In 1629, the patroonship system was introduced as a solution to the financial problems of the WIC.Jacobs (1999) p. 118. The system of patroonships enabled Amsterdam investors to obtain large tracts of land on the condition that fifty families settled within those lands within four years. The patroons could establish and administer courts of justice (Patroon‚Äôs Courts). Appeal was possible to the director and the council of the WIC in New Amsterdam for fines higher than 50 guilders.Moglen (1994) p. 3-4, and Jacobs (1999) p. 118-120. The most famous and successful patroon was Kiliaen van Rensselaer who established Rensselaerwyck. The system of patroonships did not affect New Amsterdam, as the WIC retained control over Manhattan.Jacobs (1999), p. 119-120. By 1640 the WIC no longer was the only commercial power in the territory of New Netherlands. There was a growing group of colonists who were attached to their new land, and who had their own interests. The policy of WIC director Willem Kieft aggravated the Indians, which led to conflicts between the Indians and the colonists. These incidents worsened the relationship between the colonists and the WIC.Jacobs (1999) p. 133. In response to the killing of a Dutch farmer by an Indian in 1641, director Kieft called a meeting with all heads of the families of Manhattan Island. A body of 12 men was formed to advise the director on retaliatory measures against the Indians, but they had higher ambitions. In 1642, the 12 men sent a petition to the director, calling attention to the system of governance in the colony. They wanted a government that resembled that of the Republic of the United Provinces back home. They also asked for criminal cases to longer be adjudicated without at least 5 members of the council present. When Kieft showed no inclination to make the suggested reforms, the body of eight men (the successor of the body of twelve) expressed their discontent about Kieft to the States-General and the WIC chambers in Amsterdam in 1643 and 1644.Jacobs (1999) p. 136. By the end of 1644, the complaints of the council about Kieft‚Äôs dominant behavior found sympathy at the States-General and the WIC chamber of Amsterdam, and Kieft was called back to the Republic.Jacobs (1999) p. 138.  Reforms under Peter Stuyvesant  In early 1645, Peter Stuyvesant was appointed as director of New Amsterdam, and he was instructed to introduce a new form of government. However, due to internal conflicts in the WIC, Stuyvesant and vice-director Lubbert van Dincklagen arrived in New Amsterdam in 1647. The director, the vice-director and the fiscaal formed the Council. This Council was to be involved in all matters of governance and adjudication. In the latter function, the fiscaal acted as a public prosecutor, and the highest military official at hand took his position in the Council. The Council in the judicial formation was to be supplemented in criminal cases by two burghers from the place where the crime was committed.Jacobs (1999) p. 138. In addition to these reforms, Stuyvesant created a ‚ÄúBody of Nine Men‚Äù, consisting of three farmers, three burghers, and three tradesmen, which provided panels of three judges for civil cases to supplement the judicial formation of the director and the council.Jacobs (1999) p. 140. On 4 April 1652, the States-General ordered several reforms, and as a result, a new Court of Magistrates for the city of New Amsterdam was set up in 1653.Jacobs (1999) p. 146-147. This court was modeled on the courts of justice in Amsterdam, consisting of a schout, two burgomasters, and five schepenen. Consistent with the judicial tradition in the 17th century Republic of the United Provinces, there were no jury trials and the use of arbitration to resolve disputes was widespread.Moglen (1994) p. 5-6. The Court of Magistrates had jurisdiction over civil cases with a maximum of 100 guilders in controversy, small criminal cases, and arbitration on other disputes with the consent of the parties. In 1656, its jurisdiction in criminal cases was extended to cover cases requiring physical punishments (instead of fines).Jacobs, p. 158. Although the magistrates were laymen, they were generally held to have a good knowledge of Dutch (customary) law. The WIC provided law books, and vice-director Van Dincklagen and Adriaen van der Donck, former schout of Rensselaerwijck and a member of the Nine Men, held law degrees of Dutch universities.Richard B. Morris, ‚ÄúThe New York City‚Äôs Mayor‚Äôs Court‚Äù, in: Leo Hershkowitz and Milton M. Klein, Courts and law in early New York ‚Äì Selected essays, 1978, p. 20.  Regime-change: the English rule and the Duke‚Äôs laws  In August 1664, four English battleships invaded the harbor of New Amsterdam. On 6 September 1664, the Dutch capitulated, and Colonel Richard Nicolls was appointed as the new governor of the territory of New Netherlands, which was renamed New York, after its new proprietor, the Duke of York. Upon surrendering, the Dutch negotiated the so-called ‚ÄúArticles of Capitulation‚Äù, which stated the conditions of the surrender. The Articles included provisions protecting the Dutch legal and judicial institutions.Moglen (1994) p. 7, and Jacobs (1999) p. 164-165. For example, the Dutch could keep their inheritance laws, which were very different from the English system, and Dutch law would still govern contracts concluded before the capitulation. Article 16 of the Articles of Capitulation stipulated that magistrates could keep their position for the period for which they were appointed.Jacobs (1999) p. 165. This meant that they continued in their official functions until 2 February 1665, the day on which they appointed their own successors.Jacobs p. 167. See also Alden Chester, Legal and Judicial history of NY, 1911, (reprint 1983), Vol. I,, p. 149 and onwards. This meant that in New Amsterdam, which was renamed New York City, and Albany, there was a transition period in which the old Dutch rules and customs were respected. In other parts of the colony, the so-called Duke's laws (after the Duke of York, the proprietor of the colony) were adopted. The Duke‚Äôs laws introduced an English centralized system of government and adjudication, as opposed to the Dutch decentralized structure. The governor and his council had yearly meetings with the high-sheriff and justices of the peace in the Court of Assizes. This was the highest court in the colony; appeal was only possible to the English king. There was to be a court of sessions, made up of justices of the peace and the under-sheriff, in all three ‚Äúridings‚Äù of the county of Yorkshire, which were courts of appeal for local disputes. In turn, every village had its local government: a constable and 8 ‚Äúoverseers‚Äù chosen by the free men. The constable was also the president of the local court.Jacobs (1999) p. 167. In June 1665 Nicolls introduced the English form of municipal government in New York City and ordered that the Court of Magistrates should be renamed ‚ÄúMayor‚Äôs Court‚Äù. Although the Dutch burgomaster and other officials objected against the reforms because they considered them to violate the Articles of Capitulation, the actual structure of the New York City government and judiciary did not change much. The roles of schout, burgomaster and schepenen were essentially maintained, but under different names: sheriff, mayor, and aldermen, respectively.Jacobs (1999) p. 168. The roles of mayor and sheriff were now fulfilled by Englishmen, and Nicholas Bayard, who was bilingual, was appointed as secretary. The mayor's court acted as a court of probate, a surrogates court, and a court of sessions.Robert C. Ritchie, The Duke's Province, University Of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill 1977, p. 41. Dutch remained the spoken language at the Mayor‚Äôs Court until well into the 1670s, and records were kept in Dutch and English until 1673.Morris (1978) p. 20. One could say that the only real change was the introduction of the English concept of jury trials. Several authors have suggested that the Dutch did not appreciate the concept of trial by jury.Mrs. Schuyler van Rensselaer, History of the City of New York in the 17th century, Vol. II, The MacMillan Company, 1909, p. 153 Traditionally, the Dutch courts relied heavily on arbitrators and referees. It is suggested that the Dutch community in the New York area withdrew from the changed legal system that was now dominated by English juries, and instead turned to the Dutch Reformed church for their arbitration.Ritchie (1977), p. 143. In 1673 there was a brief reoccupation of New Amsterdam by the Dutch, during which the Dutch system was reinstated. However, the Treaty of Westminster signed on February 9, 1674 ended the Dutch occupation, and from 1675 onwards, the Dutch influence on the New York legal system gradually diminished.

Jett and four aviation leaders discuss the use of radio technology to improve air safety, at the February, 1937, Air Safety Conference in Washington. Jett is second from left. Lt. Ewell Kirk \\"Jack\\" Jett, USN (March 20, 1893 ‚Äì April 28, 1965) was chief engineer and later a commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the United States in the late 1930s and 1940s, serving briefly as the Commission's chairman. He later managed Baltimore television station WMAR.  Military career  Jett enlisted in the U.S. Navy on June 8, 1911, under the name of John Raymond Smith of Lancaster, Virginia. He was sent to the Naval radio school at the Brooklyn Navy Yard; upon completing the course with high marks, he was appointed Electrician, 3rd class (Radio) in late 1912. He reenlisted in 1915, under his own name, rising to Chief Electrician (Radio) by 1917. He served at the Naval radio station NAA in Arlington, Virginia, in 1916, and on the USS Seattle, Sylph, and Michigan, among others, receiving the Mexican Service Medal in 1919 for his service on the Michigan. He was promoted to warrant officer as a Gunner (Radio) in late 1917. After the First World War ended, Congress quickly made significant reductions in the size of the military. While most men were simply discharged at the end of their term of enlistment, Congress provided for some sailors with specialized skills to transfer to the permanent Navy as officers. Jett was promoted to ensign in 1921. When Commander T.A.M. Craven was seconded to the Federal Radio Commission in 1929, he brought Jett, by then a lieutenant, along as his assistant; Jett remained with the Radio Commission when he retired from the Navy later that year. Jett became assistant chief engineer responsible for non-broadcast radio services (e.g., common-carrier wireless communications) under Craven in 1931.  FCC career  When the Federal Radio Commission was replaced by the Federal Communications Commission under the Communications Act of 1934, the FRC's professional staff was carried over into the new organization, and in 1937, when Craven was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to join the Commission proper, Jett was promoted to the chief engineer's post. In 1938, Jett served as a director of the Institute of Radio Engineers. He served on the U.S. delegation to numerous international radio conferences, including the 1937 Inter-American Radio Conference in Havana, at which the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement was negotiated. When Commissioner George H. Payne's term expired on June 30, 1943, Roosevelt initially renominated Payne for another seven-year term. However, for reasons unknown, Roosevelt withdrew Payne's nomination the following day. At the time, investigations of the FCC were going on in both the House and the Senate, and there was strong sentiment in both bodies to restructure the FCC in some way. Roosevelt eventually nominated Jett to replace Payne on January 12, 1944. There was immediate controversy, however, as some Republican senators felt that Jett was too closely associated with the FCC's Democratic chairman, James Lawrence Fly. Payne was a Republican, and under the Communications Act of 1934, not more than four of the then seven-member commission may be affiliated with the same political party; Jett had never voted, and testified before the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee that he had never supported any political party. Jett was confirmed unanimously on February 11, 1944, and sworn in four days later; George P. Adair was promoted to take Jett's place as the FCC's chief engineer. Jett briefly served as interim chairman of the Commission from November 16 to December 20, 1944, between Fly's resignation and the confirmation of Fly's successor, Paul A. Porter. (The chairmanship of the FCC is determined by direct appointment of the President from among the sitting Commissioners.) According to Broadcasting, he was known as the technical expert on the Commission at this time, and also as the \\"father of two-way radios in police cars.\\" Jett did not serve out his full seven-year term, leaving the Commission three and a half years later, on December 31, 1947; he was replaced by George E. Sterling.  Later life and death  Jett resigned from the FCC to become vice-president of A. S. Abell Company, publisher of the Baltimore Sun and then licensee of WMAR radio and television. He remained with WMAR until his death in 1965, at age 70. He died at Bethesda Naval Hospital after a long illness, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Viola and their two daughters.  References  ;Early life, work as chief engineer: ;Military service: Official military personnel record of E.K. Jett, U.S. Navy.

Distinguishing characteristics The Tucker & Tenorio 2009 taxonomy distinguishes Conasprella from Conus in the following ways:Tucker J.K. & Tenorio M.J. (2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Genus Conasprella Thiele, 1929 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The protoconch is multispiral with 2.5 whorls, the shell is conical in shape, the spire is elevated, the early whorls have nodules at the periphery. The body whorl has evenly spaced cords or sulci that reach the midbody to the shoulder, and the whorls may have cords on top. The anterior notch is absent and the anal notch is deep. The periostracum is smooth, and the operculum is small. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The blade is short and covers one-third of the anterior section of the radular tooth. The posterior blade is absent, a basal spur is present, and the barb is short. A shaft fold and interior posterior fold is present, however the shaft fold is difficult to detect. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found throughout the Indo-Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species are presumed to be vermivorous (meaning that they prey on marine worms) based upon their radular morphology. Species list This list of species is based on the information in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) list. Species within the genus Conasprella include: According to the 2014 taxonomy, the following species include the following subgenera: Boucheticonus, Coltroconus, Conasprella, Dalliconus, Endemoconus, Fusiconus, Kohniconus, Lilliconus, Parviconus, Pseudoconorbis, and Ximenoconus, as well as Conasprella delessertii (R√©cluz, 1843), a species \\"incertae sedes\\".

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails, including the family Conilithidae. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae (or Conilithidae) that include the genus Conasprella include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts preferred to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\". [P.

He is the son of former professional skateboarder Thomas Taylor and won Thrasher Magazine's Skater of The Year in 2011. Grant's style of skateboarding is known to be fast and powerful. He is recognized for his unique versatile skateboarding. Early life Taylor was born in Atlanta, Georgia, United States (US). Grant began skateboarding at the age of six. He began competing in amateur competitive skateboarding contests in the early 2000s, and in 2004 Grant took home second place at the Phoenix Am. Volcom noticed that Grant was incredibly talented early in his career, and began sponsoring him at an early stage in his skateboarding career. It is said that Grant's father, Thomas Taylor, has had a profound influence on Grant's introduction to skateboarding. Remy Stratton is quoted as saying ‚ÄúSeveral years later when he was six, Thomas began bringing him (Grant) to the vert sessions at Surf Expo in Orlando, FL. Grant would start from the bottom while we watched from the decks and the crowds cheered. Then he just dropped in and the crowd went nuts. Everyone loved Grant. He was determined to shred, even at this age, he fit in and was embraced by all.‚Äù In an article titled ‚ÄúThe Greatness of Grant Taylor‚Äù, written by Chris Nieratko, he demonstrates that Thomas‚Äô lax mentoring style was evident when Grant and his father skateboarded together, stating ‚ÄúWhen I went to visit them in the late '90s, I watched them shoot a doubles photo on their then miniramp with Grant blasting over his dad's lip trick. Later they went downtown and shot a doubles street photo at Bell South. In an age where skate dads are more militant coaches than bros, Thomas was always more of a skate homie than a trick choreographer‚Äù. In the same article, Nieratko also comments on how influential Thomas has been on Grant's life in skateboarding, saying ‚ÄúIt's thanks to Thomas that we have Grant in our lives, both literally and figuratively. Thomas taught young Grant to skate everything at a very early age‚Äù. Family Grant's father, Thomas Taylor, has had a profound impact on the skateboarding industry. Thomas Taylor is credited with formulating and operating Atlanta's first skateboard shop ‚ÄúStratosphere\\" in Little Five Points. His mother, Rachael Taylor, was a full-time stay-at-home mom raising Grant as well his two sisters, McKenzie and Sarah. Happily married Lillian Jane Morgan (Taylor) on Saturday, September 9, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. Professional skateboarding Taylor is \\"goofy\\"-footed and attained professional status in 2009, shortly after his acclaimed appearance in Nike SB's skateboard film, Debacle. He is recognized as representing the epitome of a new breed of skateboarder, blending contemporary style with the older traditions of skateboarding. He is known for his versatile riding, not shying away from various forms of skateboarding. He was born in Atlanta, Georgia where he currently still resides. Sponsors Taylor's sponsors are Monster Energy Drink, Anti-Hero, Independent, Volcom, Stratosphere Skateshop, Shake Junt, Nike SB, Modus, and Spitfire. Contest history Along with members of the Nike SB Team, Taylor won Thrasher's \\"King of The Road\\" contest in 2010 and also participated in the 2011 competition. Grant also won the silver medal in the skateboard park competition for the 2014 summer X-Games in Austin, TX. 2011 Skater of the Year In 2011, Grant won one of skateboarding's most coveted awards, Thrasher Magazine Skater of The Year award. Grant won the award over other stand out skaters of 2011, including Nyjah Huston, Dennis Busenitz and Brandon Westgate. Several reasons attribute to Grant's award of Skater of the Year. At the outset of 2011, Grant attained to back-to-back covers (January & February) for Thrasher magazine, an attribute previously only held by professional skateboarder Neil Blender. 2011 also marked the second year Grant would attend the Thrasher King of the Road contest tour event and his second Thrasher Skate Rock tour. While other contenders for the Skater of the Year award were taking the more traditional route of competing in contest after contest, and seeking mainstream attention from the skateboarding world, Grant utilized the more traditional and humble modes of coverage, mainly sticking to print magazines, video footage and word-of-mouth. In honor of Grant winning the skater of the year award his primary and longest serving sponsor Volcom released a statement and tribute to Taylor, ‚ÄúThese last few years Grant put it in hyper drive, truly a calculated adrenalin junky in constant attack mode. We are simply pleased as punch that Grant is now Thrasher Magazine's SKATER of the YEAR! Being alongside him, watching him grow up and become who he is today has been nothing short of incredible. We at VOLCOM all say Congratulations and wish you the best‚Äù. Grant's professional shoe sponsor, Nike SB, also honored his achievement of what could be considered skate boarding's most prestigious award by designing limited run team edition 2 shoes. The team editions 2's are black suede, featuring a Skater of the Year ‚Äô11 and are showcased in a luxuriously engraved wooden shoe box. Only Grant, friends and family were awarded with the shoes.

M. Kaye. The story, set in early Cold War Berlin, prior to the erection of the Berlin Wall, focuses on Miranda Brand who goes on a one-month vacation to the divided German city. She is invited there by her cousin Robert, a British Army officer stationed in Berlin, and his wife Stella. On the way, Brigadier Brindley relates to a party of British officers and their families - among them Miranda - a WWII story of a fortune in lost diamonds, in which Miranda herself is revealed to be mysteriously involved. This mystery from the past turns out to have very sinister present day implications. Miranda's vacation becomes increasingly ominous, with murders following each other, first on the night train and then in Berlin itself. Much of Berlin is still in ruins, the Cold War is raging and Miranda happens to witness the handover of secret information by a spy. However, the Soviets are not the villains here. They are very much in the background, as are the German inhabitants of Berlin, struggling to rebuild their devastated city (the book has virtually no German characters, apart from domestic servants in British homes). Rather, the devastated Berlin of the early Cold War serves as the backdrop to the lethal jealousies and tensions rending the enclave of British military personnel, their wives and domestic servants. At the explosive ending, Miranda comes close to being murdered herself - by the most unlikely of all suspects. Characters * Miranda Brand - a young model on a vacation which turned nasty. * Brigadier Brindley - a veteran officer with a penchant for story- telling. * Robert Melville - Miranda's cousin, an easygoing, charming military officer. * Stella Melville - Robert's wife, who had raised the orphaned Miranda from a young age. * Andy Page - Robert's fellow officer, living in a troubled and disharmonious marriage. * Sally Page - Andy's wife, who is in love with Robert and might be having an affair with him. * Harry Marson - Another of Robert's fellow officers. * Elsa Marson - Harry's wife, whose English bears traces of a foreign accent - but what exactly was her original language? * Colonel Leslie - A seemingly bland and boring senior officer. * Norah Leslie - The colonel's wife, who knows past secrets and harbors deep grudges. * Lottie - The Melvilles' seven years old daughter, who knows more than she is telling. * Wally - Lottie's nine years old friend, a naughty and clever boy who plays amateur detective - and is quite good at it. * Mademoiselle Beljame - The cold and efficient governess who takes good care of Lottie. But is Beljame her real name? * Friedel - The Melvilles' German house servant, who might have more on her mind than domestic service. * Simon Lang - A highly capable detective, intelligence operative, and poker player. Is he in love with Miranda? Or does he suspect her of murder? Or both? Author's personal background As noted by the author in the forward to the book, it was inspired by having actually spent time in Berlin as the wife of a British Army officer. The book's social millieu of Berlin-based British officers and their wives was thus quite familiar to her. A similar background is given in the forward to other books entitled \\"Death in ...\\".

The last excavation of the site occurred just before the reservoir was built; Joe Caldwell and Carl F. Miller conducted the excavation during a three-week period between January 12 and June 1, 1948. However, they are not the first people to examine the site. William Bartram first described the mounds in 1773 as: \\"an imposing group of one large and several smaller mounds standing adjacent to some extensive structures [which he called tetragon terraces].\\" In 1848, George White claimed \\"the smaller mounds had been nearly destroyed.\\" Then, Charles C. Jones, Jr. stated that \\"only traces of the smaller mounds remained and the tetragon terraces were no more than gentle elevations.\\" Less than 10 years later, in 1886, John P. Rogan excavated part of the site under Cyrus Thomas and found only the largest mound and one of the smaller mounds still standing. Rogan's excavation was the last before Caldwell and Miller's excavation in 1948. However, there was a flood in 1908 that almost completely destroyed the large mound. Caldwell and Miller excavated five test pits in and around the large mound and six pits in the adjacent village area. The excavations yielded animal remains and pottery sherds; it also provided good cross sections of strata. Most of the decorated pottery was classified as Lamar Complicated Stamped Pottery, which dates from A.D. 1450 to A.D. 1650. These findings suggest that the mound and village were mainly occupied during one period. However, other pottery sherds indicate sporadic occupation in earlier times. Other pottery found at the site includes Lamar Plain Pottery and Lamar Bold Incised Pottery; both of these pottery types were made at the same time as Lamar Complicated Stamped Pottery. There is far more undecorated, or Lamar Plain, pottery at the site then is usually present at similar sites dating to the same period. Caldwell reported the dimensions of the large mound in 1948 as being 118 by 35 ft and 4 ft high. In contrast, in 1773 Bartram estimated the dimensions of the mound as 40 or 50 ft high with the base having a circumference of 200 or 300 yards. Caldwell also noted that the mound, which was within 130 feet of the river, sustained damage as result of its proximity to the river; the mound had been washed out in places along the edges. Caldwell and Miller agree with earlier descriptions that the large mound was a circular, flat-topped mound. In the 1886 excavation, Thomas reported that the small mound was 58 ft long, 41 ft wide, and 6 ft high. Caldwell also agrees with earlier assertions that the Rembert Mounds were surrounded by a fair size village, although there was very little surface evidence at the time of the excavation in 1948.

History The Oregon Trail passed through Soda Springs. At the time it was known as the \\"Oasis of Soda Springs\\". Between Fort Laramie and Fort Boise, Soda Springs was a major landmark and is the second oldest settlement in Idaho. Sulphur Springs was the first hot spring that the Oregon Trail immigrants encountered in the soda springs area. Pyramid springs was discovered by fur trappers and pioneers, they discovered the springs by noticing mounds of soda formed rock and clay. Johnkirk Townsends said in his diary, ‚ÄúOur encampment on the 8th was near what are called the‚ÄôWhite Clay pits,‚Äù still on Bear River. The soil is soft chalk, white and tenacious: and in the vicinity are several springs of strong super carbonated water which bubble up with all the activity of artificial fountains. The taste was very agreeable and refreshing, resembling Saratoga water but not so saline. The whole plain to the hills is having depressions on their summits from which once issued streams of water. The extent of these eruptions, at some former period, must have been very great. At about half a mile distant, is an eruptive thermal spring of the temperature of 90 [degrees], and near this is an opening in the earth front which a stream of gas issues without water.‚Äù Ninety Percent Spring This spring was known for its excellent water quality. Fred J. Kiesel of Ogden Utah heard of the excellent water and set up a bottling plant with W.J. Clark of Butte, MT.

It has been capped, and a timer activates it once every hour on the hour. The water is about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. There is now a park and a visitor center at the site.

He served in the 19th Special Forces Group, 1457th Combat Engineer Battalion of the Utah Army National Guard from 1988 to 1996, and was on active duty during Operation Desert Storm. He received several military awards for his service, including the United States Army Achievement Medal for Desert Storm and the National Defense Service Medal. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1994 from Utah State University and his Juris Doctor in 1998 from the University of Virginia School of Law. In 1999 he served as a law clerk for District Judge J. Thomas Greene of the United States District Court for the District of Utah. He was an associate at Snow, Christensen & Martineau from 2000 to 2005. From 2005 to 2011, he was an associate at Burbridge, Mitchell & Gross. From 2011 to 2012, he again practiced at Snow, Christensen & Martineau as a shareholder. His practice focused on complex commercial litigation and catastrophic personal injury cases on behalf of both plaintiffs and defendants. Shelby served on the Salt Lake County Bar Association's Executive Committee since 2002, and as its vice chairman since 2011. He served on the Utah Supreme Court‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure and its Ethics and Discipline Committee. He lives in Salt Lake City with his wife, Angela, and their two children. He is a registered Republican. Federal judicial service On November 30, 2011, President Obama nominated Robert J. Shelby to be District Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Utah, replacing Judge Tena Campbell who took senior status in 2011. He received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 28, 2012 and his nomination was reported to the floor on April 26, 2012, by voice vote. Both Senators from Utah, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, endorsed his nomination, with Sen. Lee describing Shelby as \\"pre-eminently qualified\\" and predicting that he would be \\"an outstanding judge.\\"http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/12-3-28HatchStatement.pdf Hatch highly lauded Shelby: \\"A man of keen intellect, Robert Shelby...has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the law\\". In the early hours of September 22, 2012, on what was officially still the legislative day of September 21, the Senate confirmed Shelby in a voice vote. He received his commission on September 25, 2012. He became Chief Judge in 2018.  Notable decisions  On December 20, 2013, Judge Shelby struck down Amendment 3 of Utah‚Äôs State Constitution, which defined marriage as a union solely between a man and a woman, opening the way for same-sex marriage in the state. He found that Amendment 3 was in violation of the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs 14th Amendment, which guarantees due process and equal protection. This highly significant ruling set off a series of other district court decisions that overturned bans in several other states. His ruling was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 25, 2014. On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined the review the Tenth Circuit's ruling, legalizing same-sex marriage in Utah.

The Oregonian (Portland), p. 6. and sat vacant for several years until 1984, when work to renovate it and convert it for apartments began. It reopened as an apartment building in 1986, with the lowermost two floors reserved for commercial use. The building was listed on the NRHP in 1979. The world's first cable television system was set up in 1948 using an antenna on the roof of the Hotel Astoria. History Construction began in November 1922 and was completed in late 1923, and the Hotel Astoria opened for business on January 1, 1924. At the start of construction, the plans called for the hotel to be five stories tall, but only a month later, on December 8, 1922, a fire destroyed almost all of downtown Astoria. The resulting severe shortage of housing prompted the Columbia Hotel Company to revise the design to increase the planned height to eight stories. The hotel was the tallest building in Oregon outside of Portland when completed and the tallest commercial structure on the Oregon Coast. Emporis gives its height as . It was eclipsed by the nine-story, Marshfield Hotel (now the Tioga Hotel), in Coos Bay, in 1926, when construction of that building's overall structure neared completion. However, work on the Marshfield was soon suspended, and the building stood vacant (its uppermost stories a windowless shell) until the late 1940s, when it was finally completed and opened for use for the first time, as the Tioga Hotel. Until the Tioga Hotel's opening in 1948, the Hotel Astoria remained the tallest commercial structure in use on the Oregon Coast. The building has an L-shaped footprint. On its most prominent side, the west fa√ßade, it extends the full length of the block on 14th Street between Commercial and Duane streets. It is nearly as wide on its north side, along Commercial Street, but less than half as wide on its south and east sides. The original exterior color was mainly white, with gray on the first two floors. View from the northwest, showing the building's two widest sides In its early years, the hotel was \\"the hub of the city's business dealings and social activities\\". In addition to 150 rooms for guests, the building included ten residential apartments on its top floor. The local chamber of commerce had its office in the hotel, and the basement included show space for salesmen. The hotel hosted many conventions, and several community groups used it as their regular meeting place. However, the hotel began to struggle financially within just a few years. It was beset with a variety of problems, involving \\"prohibition agents, liquor control officers, labor troubles and military police. The Army declared the area off-limits, and the Navy proclaimed it out-of-bounds,\\" The Daily Astorian wrote in a 2011 retrospective article. The completion of the Sunset Highway in 1949 contributed to the decline in business, as it gave Portlanders a second route to the Oregon Coast, one not passing through Astoria. From the 1930s on, ownership of the hotel changed hands several times. In late 1951, the Hotel Astoria was renamed the John Jacob Astor Hotel,Moyes, William (December 3, 1951). \\"Behind the Mike\\" (society column). The Oregonian, Section 2, p. 2. Excerpt: \\"Johnny Osburn has renamed the Hotel Astoria the 'John Jacob Astor hotel' and installed 12 apartments, new rugs, hangings and decorations.\\" in honor of the city's namesake, John Jacob Astor. The landmark building was repainted pink. However, a postwar decline in business continued, and other problems persisted. In 1961, the Astoria Fire Department found 51 code violations, six of them major, but all of the violations remained uncorrected seven years later. The restaurant and \\"Fur Trader Lounge\\" bar were closed by the Internal Revenue Service in early 1968 for failure to pay taxes. Closure and long vacancy In 1968, city officials condemned the building, declaring it a public nuisance and a fire hazard, and ordered it vacated. Except for a small Greyhound Lines terminal that was still operating in 1970, the building sat vacant for several years. A 1978 plan by the city to tear the building down was dropped when voters turned down a request for public funding to carry out the demolition. The Clatsop County government took ownership in 1978 through tax foreclosure\\"Hurdles cleared for hotel restoration\\" (November 8, 1984). The Oregonian, p. MW12. and sold the building at auction in early 1979. During 1979, a group of local historians hoping to prevent further threat of demolition succeeded in an effort to get the landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places. However, a succession of proposals to renovate and reopen the \\"derelict eyesore\\" failed to come to fruition. In 1983, a feature article about Astoria in The Sunday Oregonian referred to the Astor Hotel: \\"Formerly the pride of Astoria, the once-elegant inn now houses only frequent trespassers and serves as a haven for minor-in-possession juveniles with little to do on an Astoria Saturday night.\\" Still wearing the pink paint, now faded, that it was given in the 1950s, the decaying building that still dominated the downtown skyline had come to be known as \\"the pink elephant\\" by local residents. At the end of an eight-year period as Astoria's mayor, Bob Chopping had given up hope of saving the hotel, telling a reporter in early 1983 that, \\"Citizens must have realized after all these years, chances of renovation is nil.\\" Conversion to apartments Looking east on downtown's main street. The Astor Hotel building is the city's tallest commercial structure. In late 1984, a plan was approved in which private investors would convert the former hotel into 70 apartments for low-income residents on the six upper floors and commercial space on the first two floors. The building reopened in 1986 with 66 apartments of subsidized housing, referred to as the Astor Apartments and no longer colored pink. The lowermost two floors remained mostly vacant into the 1990s, but gradually businesses moved into the commercial spaces. The ornate lobby remained unused until 2010, when a business selling vintage furniture and hardware moved into the space. Design The Hotel Astoria (later John Jacob Astor Hotel) was designed by architects Tourtellotte & Hummel, who were based in Portland from 1922 to 1930 and who, after the Astoria project, designed two other hotels that are now NRHP-listed: the Lithia Springs Hotel (Ashland, Oregon) and the Redwoods Hotel (Grants Pass, Oregon). Constructed of reinforced concrete, the eight-story John Jacob Astor Hotel building features Gothic decorative elements. The seventh floor is decorated with several escutcheons, one every third window, and the window groups at the building's corners at this level are additionally topped by rounded arches \\"embellished with elaborate cartouches in cast stone\\". Each group of three windows at the mezzanine level, or second floor, includes two Corinthian pilasters and is topped by a pointed arch and a frieze with three small shields above. The lobby is two stories high at its center and includes numerous Corinthian columns. It originally included a large fireplace and \\"an elegant wrought-iron chandelier with parchment shades over electric candles\\". Cable television birthplace The former hotel has been called the \\"birthplace of cable television\\". In 1948, the Hotel Astoria was the site of the \\"world's first cable television system\\",Murphy, Francis (August 8, 1972). \\"Early rough start for local cable\\" (first cable TV in Portland, 20 years ago). The Oregonian (Portland), Section 2, p. 7. invented by L. E. \\"Ed\\" Parsons, then owner of Astoria radio station KAST. Ed Parsons set up the first U.S. cable television system to use coaxial cable and a community antenna to deliver TV signals to an area that otherwise would not have been able to receive broadcast TV signals. The first television station in the Pacific Northwest was inaugurated in November 1948 by Seattle radio station KRSC, now KING-TV. Astoria being about from Seattle, Parsons \\"was unable to get a picture in his apartment, even with a high antenna\\". His apartment was located across the street from the eight-story Hotel Astoria, and with permission from the hotel's manager he set up an antenna on the building's roof and ran coaxial cable from there to his apartment. The set-up worked, and Parsons and his wife were the only people in Astoria able to view television, starting on Thanksgiving Day 1948. \\"Reception was not of a quality that would be saleable today,\\" Parsons told The Oregonian in 1972, \\"but we received a picture and started attracting guests.\\" The couple quickly became overwhelmed by requests from friends and neighbors eager to pay them a visit to experience the new medium. To appease them, Parsons laid a second cable to a TV set in the hotel's lobby, and by the end of December a nearby music store was the third hook-up. Parsons then began setting up cable television connections to area households, with 25 receiving the service by mid-March 1949 and 100 by July. Some time later, Parsons moved his community antenna from the roof of the Hotel Astoria to a separate location elsewhere in town and also added a second antenna site.

The building served as the city hall of Astoria from 1905 until 1939. It was the first location of the Columbia River Maritime Museum, from 1963 to 1982, and has been the Heritage Museum since 1985. History as city hall The first Astoria city hall was designed and built in 1878 by Albert W. Ferguson. His son's firm of Ferguson & Houston also built the second building, located at 16th and Exchange streets, but the building's design was by Emil Schacht. The new building would be larger than its predecessor, as well as more modern. Construction began in 1904 and was completed in June 1905. The second Astoria City Hall was formally dedicated on July 4, 1905. All city offices, as well as the city library, were located in the new building. In the 1930s, it was decided to move city hall to a location in downtown, as the location at 16th and Exchange streets was rather isolated; the original, 1878 city hall had also been located in downtown Astoria. The city used a Public Works Administration grant to fund the conversion of a former bank building on Duane Street into a New City Hall.\\"Astoria Bid Low on Two City Jobs: Remodeling of Buildings to Cost $39,309\\" (December 18, 1938).

To avoid confusion with the existing Astoria City Hall, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department identifies the building as \\"Astoria City Hall (Old)\\" in its list of registered historic properties in Oregon. In 1980, members of the Clatsop County Historical Society voted to purchase the Old City Hall and renovate it for use as a museum.

(2009), Systematic Classification of Recent and Fossil Conoidean Gastropods, ConchBooks, Hankenheim, Germany, 295 pp. * Genus Conus sensu stricto Linnaeus, 1758 :: Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The basic shell shape is conical to elongated conical, has a deep anal notch on the shoulder, a smooth periostracum and a small operculum. The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Conasprelloides Tucker & Tenorio, 2009 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is turbinate to elongate conical in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral, the body whorl has ridges, and the whorl tops have nodules that may persist on later whorls. The anal notch is deep. The color pattern is simple and without clear spiral lines. The periostracum is tufted, and the operculum is small. Similar to Gladioconus, however the species in this genus do not retain nodules into their outer whorls, and do not have well developed darker brown markings on the whorl tops beyond the early whorls. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radula is usually shorter than posterior section. The blade is indistinct but long and covers most of the length of the anterior section of the radular tooth. A basal spur is present, and the barb is short. The radular tooth has serrations and the terminating cusp is internal. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the West Atlantic.. ::Feeding habits :::These species are presumed to be vermivorous (meaning that they prey on marine worms) based upon the aspect of the radular tooth. Several published studies consider these species vermivores, discussing a unique conopressin in the venom chemistry, without providing details on their diet.Moller, C. & Mari, F.

Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae that include the genus Conaspelloides include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al. (2011).Bouchet P., Kantor Yu.I., Sysoev A. & Puillandre N. (2011). \\"A new operational classification of the Conoidea\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 77: 273-308. Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still prefer to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\".

In-focus in the left half of the picture, suspended from one of the twigs, is a red cardboard-woven Froebel star. Four tips and seven prongs are visible. A Froebel star () is a Christmas decoration made of paper, common in Germany. In English it does not have a commonly recognised name; it can be referred to as Advent star, Danish star, German star, Nordic star, Pennsylvanian star, Polish star, Swedish star, Christmas star, or Froebel star. It is also sometimes called a Moravian star, though the Moravian star is a general category of geometrical shapes and the sixteen tipped piece of origami is specifically called the Froebel star. Description A Froebel star The three-dimensional Froebel star is assembled from four identical paper strips with a width-to-length proportion of between 1:25 and 1:30. The weaving and folding procedure can be accomplished in about forty steps. The product is a paper star with eight flat prongs and eight cone-shaped tips. The assembly instructions can be aborted midway, producing a two-dimensional eight‚Äìpronged star without cones. Crafting Froebel stars originates in German folklore. Traditionally the stars would be dipped into wax and sprinkled with glitter after being folded. The star can be considered a form of origami, because it is made of identical paper sheets and assembled without glue. However, as it combines folding with weaving it is more a \\"fringe\\" subject of origami. History Froebel stars made from lauhala in Puna, Hawai ªi The Froebel star carries the name of the German educationist Friedrich Fr√∂bel (1782‚Äì1852), founder of the Kindergarten concept. He encouraged the use of paper folding in pre‚Äìprimary education with the aim of conveying simple mathematical concepts to children. It is, however, likely that Froebel did not invent this item and that it had already been within the realm of general knowledge for a long time. Froebel did encourage paper folding as an activity for young children and he popularised discourse about children's activities, which is how his name and the folding instructions might have become related. Descriptions of how to fold a Froebel star date back to at least the 19th century. In Germany the name Fr√∂belstern has been the common name for this paper decoration since the 1960s. It is used as an ornament on Christmas trees and wreaths, and to make garlands and mobiles. Froebel stars are very common in Germany, although few people know how to make them.

The company was acquired by Twitter in November 2011. Some of the company's software products were released under free software licenses after the acquisition, which led to the creation of an independent organization called Open Whisper Systems. History Security researcher Moxie Marlinspike and roboticist Stuart Anderson co-founded Whisper Systems in 2010. The company produced proprietary enterprise mobile security software. Among these were an encrypted texting program called TextSecure and an encrypted voice calling app called RedPhone. They also developed a firewall and tools for encrypting other forms of data. On November 28, 2011, Whisper Systems announced that it had been acquired by Twitter. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed by either company. The acquisition was done \\"primarily so that Mr. Marlinspike could help the then-startup improve its security\\". Shortly after the acquisition, Whisper Systems' RedPhone service was made unavailable. Some criticized the removal, arguing that the software was \\"specifically targeted [to help] people under repressive regimes\\" and that it left people like the Egyptians in \\"a dangerous position\\" during the events of the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Twitter released TextSecure as free and open-source software under the GPLv3 license in December 2011. RedPhone was also released under the same license in July 2012. Marlinspike later left Twitter and founded Open Whisper Systems as a collaborative Open Source project for the continued development of TextSecure and RedPhone. As of May 2015, Open Whisper Systems consists of a large community of volunteer Open Source contributors, as well as a small team of dedicated grant-funded developers. In November 2015, Open Whisper Systems merged TextSecure with RedPhone and renamed it as Signal. Products Whisper Systems' products were all made for Android and included: * TextSecure: An app that allowed the user to exchange end-to-end encrypted SMS messages with other TextSecure users. * RedPhone: An app that allowed the user to make end-to-end encrypted VoIP calls to other RedPhone users. * Flashback: An app that allowed the user to store encrypted backups of their device in the cloud. * WhisperCore: An app that integrated with the underlying Android OS to protect everything the user kept on their phone. The initial beta featured full disk encryption, network security tools, encrypted backup, selective permissions, and basic platform management tools for Nexus S and Nexus One phones. * WhisperMonitor: An app that worked with WhisperCore to provide a software firewall capable of dynamic egress filtering and real-time connection monitoring, giving the user control over where their data was going and what their apps were doing.

He holds the record for the most nominations for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Commercials. Early life Pytka studied fine arts at the Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon), and chemical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. He began his film career at WRS Motion Pictures while still in college. He moved to New York as a post- production supervisor at MGM Telestudios but returned to Pittsburgh to make documentaries at WQED, a flagship production center of the then National Educational Television Network, now PBS. His work there for NET Playhouse garnered many awards and the film A View of the Sky was the official United States Government film at the Expo '67 World's Fair in Montreal. He left to form his own production company with Rift Fournier and produced and directed many short films, documentaries and commercials. As a part of his documentary Maggie's Farm, Richie Havens and Bob Dylan allowed him to use their music. It was a precursor to the current music video form. Through motorcycle racing, he met Steve McQueen, and they began to collaborate on a documentary on off-road desert racing. The project never came about but Pytka finished the short film High Flying Bird, featuring McQueen driving an off-road desert vehicle, again, to Richie Havens' music. Through his love of jazz, Pytka began to use the music in much of his work, using Gary McFarland, Don Elliot, and Chico Hamilton during this period. Professional life Pytka adapted the documentary form into his work in commercials and eventually moved to New York, then to Los Angeles. To date he has directed many commercials, several films, documentaries and music videos. He has been acclaimed for his work with celebrities and athletes ranging from Michael Jackson to Michael Jordan, doing extensive work with each.

The video won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1997.  Music video for \\"Free as a Bird\\"  The music video for \\"Free as a Bird\\" was produced by Vincent Joliet and directed by Joe Pytka and depicts, from the point of view of a bird in flight, many references to Beatles songs, such as \\"Penny Lane\\", \\"Paperback Writer\\", \\"A Day in the Life\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Piggies\\", \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Doctor Robert\\", and \\"The Fool on The Hill\\". Between 80 and 100 allusions to the Beatles' story, music and lyrics in the video have been estimated. Although the bird can be heard at the beginning of the video, it is never seen. Neil Aspinall (Apple Records executive at the time) said that this was because no- one could agree on what kind of bird it should be.\\"The Beatles Anthology\\" DVD 2003 (Special Features: Making the Free as a Bird video - 0:00:17) Pytka and Aspinall talking about the idea of a bird and song titles on the \\"Free as a Bird\\" video.

Derek Taylor (ex-Apple Records executive) sent a two- page letter to Pytka confirming that he could proceed, and personally encouraged and supported Pytka's ideas.\\"The Beatles Anthology\\" DVD 2003 (Special Features: Making the Free as a Bird video - 0:01:06) Pytka talking about the agreement for his ideas.

Although Pytka fixed the ideas on a storyboard, he abandoned it as soon as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycamera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea.\\"The Beatles Anthology\\" DVD 2003 (Special Features: Making the Free as a Bird video - 0:04:44) Pytka talking about the storyboard.

Harrison played the ukulele in the studio for the song, and asked to appear as the ukulele player seen only from behind at the very end of the video. Pytka resisted this, as he felt it would be wrong for any contemporary members of the Beatles to appear on screen. Pytka later stated that it was \\"heartbreaking\\" that Harrison had not played the role, particularly after Harrison's death in 2001 and upon discovering that the ukulele was not a sample of an old song as Pytka had assumed.\\"The Beatles Anthology\\" DVD 2003 (Special Features: Making the Free as a Bird video - 0:10:16) Pytka talking about Harrison and the ukulele player.

The hospital is located on Tonbridge Road, around to the north-west of Pembury, close to the A21 trunk road. It is surrounded by woodland on three sides. History Administration building for the original hospital on the site The original hospital on the site was a workhouse designed by John Whichcord to accommodate 400 people which opened in 1836. Additional facilities included an isolation block added in 1838, a new clinical block in 1856, a chapel and a school in 1870, an entrance block in 1872 and an extension in 1890. The facility became known as Pembury County Hospital in 1938 and it joined the National Health Service in 1948. The musician, Shane MacGowan, was born in the hospital in 1957 and the athlete, Dame Kelly Holmes, was born there in 1970. After services had transferred to the new Tunbridge Wells Hospital, all the hospital buildings, other than the chapel, were demolished in September 2011. A new hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace both the Pembury County Hospital and the Kent and Sussex Hospital. The new hospital was designed by Anshen & Allen and built by Laing O'Rourke at a cost of ¬£230 million. The first phase of the new hospital, on which construction started in 2008, opened in January 2011; the rest of the hospital opened on 21 September 2011 at which time all services were transferred from the Kent and Sussex Hospital. The new hospital was denied a \\"Royal\\" prefix as though it serves Royal Tunbridge Wells, it is not located within the town's boundaries. Facilities management services are provided by Interserve. Facilities The new hospital has 512 beds and provides a full range of clinical services including an Accident and Emergency department. The first department to transfer to the new hospital was the maternity department, with the first baby being born in the new unit in January 2011. Every inpatient has their own room with en-suite facilities, with ceiling to floor windows revealing views over surrounding woodland. The maternity unit sees nearly 100 babies born every week and the A&E; department treats 50,000 patients every year.

Seeking protection from the sun, early European settlers started to make hats using fibre from the native palm, which soon became popular throughout the colonies. The process involved boiling, then drying, and finally bleaching the leaves.

History   1987  After Genichiro Tenryu and Jumbo Tsuruta split up after losing the NWA International Tag Team Championship to The Road Warriors in February 1987, Tenryu and Tsuruta engaged in a brutal rivalry. Tenryu would form his own group, separate from All Japan and Japan Pro Wrestling (which dissolved when most of them returned to New Japan Pro Wrestling) simply called Revolution. Former International Pro Wrestling stars Ashura Hara and Samson Fuyuki, as well as AJPW youngsters Toshiaki Kawada and Yoshinari Ogawa, were enlisted into the stable. Tenryu and Hara would form Revolution's main tag team, Footloose (Fuyuki and Kawada) were its secondary tag team, while Ogawa focused on the World Junior Heavyweight Championship.  1988  In 1988, Revolution began its successful run, as Footloose won the All Asia Tag Team Championship on March 9, defeating Takashi Ishikawa and Mighty Inoue. A month later on April 8, Tatsumi Kitahara debuted and joined Revolution, before heading to Stampede Wrestling in Calgary for seasoning. Four months later on August 29, Genichiro Tenryu and Ashura Hara defeated The Olympics (Jumbo Tsuruta and Yoshiaki Yatsu) for the World Tag Team Championship. However, the reign did not last long, as Tenryu and Hara lost the championship back to The Olympics 24 hours later on August 30. Footloose would lose the All Asia Tag Team Championship on September 9, after a six-month reign, to Shinichi Nakano and Shunji Takano. However, Footloose rebounded and regained the championship six days later on September 15. In November 1988, Hara was fired from AJPW by Giant Baba for massive gambling debts, so Kawada was chosen to team up with Tenryu for the World's Strongest Tag Determination League. Tenryu and Kawada would be in 4th place with 14 points. By the end of the year, The Road Warriors chose Tenryu to be their partner to hold the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Championship in December, and was eventually abandoned in the following year.  1989  On June 5, 1989, Revolution would have the biggest night, when Genichiro Tenryu defeated Jumbo Tsuruta for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, despite Footloose losing the All Asia Tag Team Championship to The Can-Am Express (Doug Furnas and Dan Kroffat) the same night. Two months later on August 18 in Canada, Tatsumi Kitahara (Sumo Hara in Stampede) teamed up with New Japan star Kensuke Sasaki (Benkei Sasaki in Stampede) and won the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship, defeating Bob and Kerry Brown. Kitahara would hold onto the title for over a month until September 29, when he and Sasaki lost the championship to the eventual final champions The Blackhearts. A month later, back in Japan, on October 11, Tenryu lost the Triple Crown back to Tsuruta. However, the group rebounded nine days later on October 20, when Footloose regained the All Asia Tag Team Championship from the Can-Am Express. A month later in November, Tenryu, Fuyuki, and Kawada would take part in the World's Strongest Tag Determination League, with Tenryu winning the tournament with Stan Hansen as his partner, winning the vacant World Tag Team title.  1990  1990 was the beginning of the end for Revolution. On March 2, Footloose lost the All Asia Tag Team Championship back to the Can-Am Express. Four days later on March 6, Genichiro Tenryu and Stan Hansen lost the World Tag Team Championship to The Miracle Violence Connection (Steve Williams and Terry Gordy). On April 26, Tenryu abruptly left All Japan Pro Wrestling, shocking the entire professional wrestling industry in Japan, effectively dissolving Revolution. After Tenryu's departure, Footloose disbanded. Toshiaki Kawada and Samson Fuyuki temporarily feuded, before Fuyuki joined Tenryu. Upon returning from Canada, Tatsumi Kitahara joined Tenryu as well. Kawada and Yoshinari Ogawa stayed with AJPW.  Aftermath  Genichiro Tenryu would use the Revolution name for his stable of his new home promotion, Super World of Sports, in which Samson Fuyuki, Tatsumi (later Koki) Kitahara, and Ashura Hara would be part of the stable as well. After SWS shut down in June 1992, Tenryu and his group formed WAR. Hara retired in October 1994 and died in 2015. Fuyuki and Kitahara later feuded with Tenryu and with each other in WAR; Fuyuki moved on to FMW in 1996. After WAR folded, Tenryu feuded with Kawada upon returning to All Japan in 2000 and faced Ogawa in Pro Wrestling Noah in the 2000s. Fuyuki, who briefly returned to AJPW in 2001 to feud with Kawada, died in 2003. Following the NOAH split in 2000, Hansen and Tenryu teamed up for one more tag team match, in which they defeated Kawada and Maunakea Mossman (later Taiyo Kea) meant to rebuild AJPW. Later that year, Hansen and Tenryu were drawn against each other in a tournament for the vacant Triple Crown, which Tenryu won. It turned out to be Hansen's last singles match, as he retired and became Commissioner of the Pacific Wrestling Federation. In the final match of the tournament, Tenryu beat Kawada. Kitahara briefly returned to AJPW to ally with Tenryu before decreasing his yearly workload of matches altogether. Kawada left AJPW in 2005 and began inactivity in August 2010, after a six-man match with Tenryu as one of his partners. In February 2015, Tenryu announced that he is retiring from professional wrestling; his last match was held on November 15. On April 2, 2018, Kitahara announced his retirement and his retirement ceremony will take place on June 11 at a show promoted by AJPW dojo classmate Kenta Kobashi, which will also be his 30th anniversary. Yoshinari Ogawa is the sole active former Revolution member, still competing for NOAH regularly.

Sheinbaum (June 12, 1920 ‚Äì September 12, 2016) was an American peace and human rights activist.http://www.usc.edu/uscnews/stories/8247.html One of the so-called Malibu Mafia, Sheinbaum joined with other wealthy Angelenos to fund liberal and progressive causes and politicians. He organized the legal defense of Daniel Ellsberg who had released the Pentagon Papers, and he initiated Israel‚ÄìPalestine talks which eventually brought about the Oslo Accords of 1993. Early life Sheinbaum was born on June 12, 1920, in New York City. His father was in the leather goods business. The family lost its money during the Great Depression. While in high school, Sheinbaum took a job after school as a sewing machine operator. Sheinbaum was drafted into the army during World War II and assigned to making aviation maps. When discharged, he applied to 33 colleges on the GI Bill, but was rejected due to his poor grades. He returned to high school, and after graduating, was accepted at Oklahoma State University‚ÄìStillwater (Oklahoma A&M;), where he excelled. After a year, he transferred to Stanford University and became an economics teacher. He subsequently accepted a position at Michigan State University teaching economics. While there, he became the administrator of a 54-person project named Michigan State University Vietnam Advisory Group (MSUG) which advised the unstable government of South Vietnam on how to prevent Communism. Sheinbaum eventually discovered that the university was providing cover for an ongoing Central Intelligence Agency operation. In 1959, he resigned from the project. Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions After leaving Michigan State University, Sheinbaum moved to Santa Barbara, California, and became part of a think tank headed by educational philosopher Robert Hutchins called the \\"Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions\\". There he met and fell in love with Betty Warner, daughter of film mogul Harry Warner, who was also an activist. They married in 1964.Citizen Stan documentary MSUG project While doing research into America's involvement in Southeast Asia, journalist Robert Scheer discovered the MSUG project. He found documents providing evidence that MSUG had been involved in the torture of Vietnamese nationals. Among the documents was a list of those involved with the project, including Sheinbaum, whom Scheer contacted. Appalled with the revelations, Sheinbaum went public with the information and became an active opponent of the Vietnam War. Because of his actions, he was dismissed from the think tank. Run for Congress In 1966 and again in 1968, Sheinbaum ran for the United States Congress in Santa Barbara on a peace platform, but was unsuccessful both times. Daniel Ellsberg defense In 1971, Sheinbaum was asked by activist \\"Ping\\" Ferry to help organize the Daniel Ellsberg Pentagon Papers defense team. He helped assemble the team of attorneys and became the main fundraiser and spokesperson, raising nearly one million dollars from over 25,000 contributors. He was joined in this effort by other wealthy Jewish men; later, the group became known as the Malibu Mafia. Arafat agreement Along with the Palestinian Intifada, Sheinbaum assembled a team of Jews to meet with Yasir Arafat to persuade him to disavow terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist. Anticipating that Arafat would question his credentials, Sheinbaum first held a meeting with then-National Security Advisor of the United States Colin Powell, explaining the situation. Five days later, Sheinbaum received a letter from President Ronald Reagan stating that if Arafat would fulfill his promises, the United States would \\"be responsive\\". Sheinbaum presented the Reagan letter to Arafat during their initial meeting, and an agreement was reached. Arafat intended to discuss the agreement in front of the United Nations, but then-Secretary of State George Shultz rejected Arafat's visa request. In response, the entire UN Assembly flew to Geneva, where Arafat spoke, stating his intentions. The effort culminated in Yitzak Rabin and Arafat shaking hands at the White House in 1993 before President Clinton. Ultimately, Arafat did not fulfill his agreement, resulting in criticism of Sheinbaum. Rodney King beating From 1991 to 1993, Sheinbaum served as President of the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners. He was highly critical of Chief Daryl Gates' response to the Rodney King beating. He believed the incident was not an isolated one, and led the effort, along with fellow commissioners, to force Gates from office. Recent times Sheinbaum served on the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) National Advisory Council.

It is Tonga's only all-girls school, was named after Tonga's late queen, SƒÅlote Lupepau ªu by King TƒÅufa ªƒÅhau Tupou IV. The school was more commonly known as The Girl's College (Kolisi Fefine). Located at Vaha'akolo Road opposite Mala ªekula, Tongatapu, the school stands where Tupou College first stood at the time of its establishment in 1866, then to Nafualu in 1921. Girls in Tonga first received formal education in Tupou College in 1870, only four years after the institution was established by Rev. Dr. James Egan Moulton. The main purpose of allowing girls to enter the institution was to train them to become good mothers and wives. In 1873, the schooling came to a sudden end at the misgivings of Mr. Baker about the propriety of the behaviour between the two genders. Only in 1881, were girls re enrolled to the institution to continue schooling. The decision was made in 1921 to relocate Tupou College to Nafualu (today's Sia ªatoutai Theological College) because the land and facilities were inadequate to cater for the growing enrollments. QSC dates its independent beginnings not from the separation in 1921, but when it gained academic independence from Tupou College in 1926 when the girls sat exams set independently from the exams set at Tupou College.  Education  The school also teaches the students traditional Tongan crafts including, weaving and knitting mats and ta'ovalas, kiekies as well as tapa-making. Classes are from forms 1-7 including a class for Catering & Hospitality.  Curriculum  The school follows the curriculum of the Tongan Government which is based on the New Zealand Curriculum. The school teaches a huge range of subjects including courses for catering and hospitality as well as courses for nursing.  Magazine  The school has a magazine published annually recording events and activities done at the school throughout that year. The magazine is known as the \\"Maamaloa Magazine\\".  House System  The school has eight houses and like Tupou College, are named after major contributors to the Wesleyan Church and the upbringing of Christianity in Tonga. They are also named after notable Tongan and Palangi women in the Tongan society. They are: *Room 1: Mata'aho (after Her Majesty Queen Halaevalu Mata ªaho  ªAhome ªe) *Room 2: Melenaite (after H.R.H.

Even though Bhanu isn't interested initially, eventually he accepts her love. Meanwhile, Singaraju makes a plan to have Swapna marry his son. Bhanu breaks his plan, marries Swapna, and enrages both of their parents. They start living in the village outskirts. An event occurs in which Madhavi insults them, so Bhanu decides to grow up and prove himself. Swapna teaches him reading, writing, and some arithmetic, while she pursues her own, I.A.S. studies. In due of time with hard work, Bhanu Prasad gradually becomes one of the biggest businessmen in town and Swapna the District Collector. They have a fine young son, Junior Harischandra Prasad (Master Anand Vardhan). At one point, Madhavi requests Bhanu to allow her husband to work in his factory, as his business is under loss. Harischandra incidentally comes across his grandson, develops a secret friendly relation with him. Knowing this, Bhanu and Swapna also feel very happy. One day, Bhanu gives his son some canned Payasam (rice pudding) to be offered to his father. Eventually, Singaraju mixes up poison in it. Vasundhara comes to know about the secret meeting of Harischandra with his grandson and urges him to accept Bhanu back into their family. She praises Bhanu to be as valuable as a diamond. At the same time, Surya as Swathi's father has a serious malady apparently because of consuming the \\"Payasam\\" to Harischandra, he is hospitalized and Bhanu is suspected of making an attempt on his father's life. At the hospital, when Singaraju and his men badly beat Bhanu, Harischandra arrives to his son's rescue. It is then when Harischandra declares that Singaraju had poisoned the \\"Payasam\\". A combat ensues between Harischandra and Singaraju until the latter confesses his guilt. Finally, Harischandra accepts Bhanu as his son, and the entire family is happily united.

Plans for the bunker called for a massive reinforced concrete barrel vault composed of 12 arch sections under which Messerschmitt Me 262 jet engines would be manufactured in a nine-storey factory. Upon completion these were to be sent to a similar installation in the area of Landsberg am Lech (codename Weingut II), where the final assembly of the aircraft was to take place. This network of underground factories was intended to ensure the production of the Me 262 at a time when the Allies had already gained control of the German airspace.Peter M√ºller: Das Bunkergel√§nde im M√ºhldorfer Hart : R√ºstungswahn und menschliches Leid. 4. Auflage. Heimatbund; M√ºhldorf a. Inn: Kreismuseum, M√ºhldorf a. Inn 2006, P. 11f. Despite it being increasingly clear to the organizers of the project that it would never be finished in time to make a difference in the war,‚ÄûDennoch war es nicht so schwer vorauszusagen, da√ü diese sechs riesigen Bunkerwerke in den versprochenen sechs Monaten nicht fertigwerden, ja, da√ü sie √ºberhaupt nicht mehr in Betrieb genommen werden k√∂nnen.‚Äú in Albert Speer: Erinnerungen. 9th edition, Frankfurt am Main 1971, p. 348. the construction of Weingut I was approved on a 6-month time-line. Of a total of 10,000 workers who worked on the project, 8,500 were forced laborers and inmates of the M√ºhldorf concentration camp network. Of these more than 3,000 died of overwork, underfeeding, and SS brutality.M√ºller (2006), p. 10 By the war's end, only 7 of the planned total of 12 bunker sections had been built, and construction of the factory itself had not begun. After the liberation of the area and its associated camps in May 1945, control of the construction site fell to the US Army, which made extensive studies of its innovative construction techniques before demolishing all but one section of the main bunker in 1947. Today the bunker grounds are a listed monument. Occasional tours of the site are offered by a Catholic nonprofit group in M√ºhldorf.  Background  The Me 262 was touted by Nazi propaganda as a Wunderwaffe In early 1944, the Allied air war began to focus primarily upon the destruction of the Luftwaffe in preparation for the invasion of Normandy. Plans for the so-called \\"Big Week\\", which was intended to permanently smash the German capacity to produce fighter aircraft through targeted airstrikes on final assembly factories, were already underway in 1943. Between February 20‚Äì25, 1944, approximately 10,000 American and British aircraft, including about 6,000 bombers, attacked strategic targets all over Germany. Following these attacks, which seriously damaged German aircraft production, the production quota fell drastically. In response the J√§gerstab (Fighter Staff) was founded in March 1944 with the task of ensuring the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. It superseded the Ministry of Aviation in this jurisdiction. At the head of the J√§gerstab was armaments minister Albert Speer, as Deputy the Secretary of State Erhard Milch, as Chief of Staff Karl Saur. Their plan to protect the aircraft industry, especially the manufacture of the jet-powered Messerschmitt Me 262, entailed the relocation of assembly plants into underground bunkers. This idea was not entirely new, as a similar (but never realized) proposal had already been considered in October 1943.Edith Raim: Die Dachauer KZ-Au√üenkommandos Kaufering und M√ºhldorf ‚Äì R√ºstungsbauten und Zwangsarbeit im Letzten Kriegsjahr 1944-45. Dissertation, Landsberg 1992, p.46 The J√§gerstab's plan included six locations in which partially underground bunkers were to be built, and at first called for the bunkers to be encompass a minimum area of 600,000 to 800,000 m2 apiece.Protokoll der F√ºhrerbesprechung vom 5. M√§rz 1944, Bundesarchiv Koblenz, R 3/1509, p. 12 However, by the time of the J√§gerstab meeting of 17 March 1944, the projected size of the each building had sunk to 60,000 m2.Protokoll der J√§gerstabssitzung vom 17. M√§rz 1944, Bundesarchiv- Milit√§rarchiv, RL 3/2, p. 677 By June 1944 the invasion of the allies had forced the J√§gerstab to focus in the end on two locations in Upper Bavaria. Three bunkers were to be built at Kaufering in the Landsberg am Lech district under the codename \\"Ringeltaube\\" (common wood pigeon), while the codename \\"Weingut I\\" (Vineyard I) was chosen for the factory in the . According to the testimony of Franz Xaver Dorsch, who was responsible for the construction, the fighter factory would be completed in five to six months at best.Raim (1992), p. 43 Speer later wrote in his memoirs that at the time it was already not difficult to foresee that the project would not be completed within the planned time.F√ºr den gesamten Absatz: Raim (1992), p. 28ff. The location in the area of M√ºhldorf fulfilled all of the important requirements. There was an adequately solid gravel bed beneath the terrace of the Inn and the water table was adequately deep. Strategically the important railway juncture of M√ºhldorf was advantageous, and the wide-ranging forest of the M√ºhldorfer Hart would offer excellent camouflage for the completed bunker.  Construction   Management  The chief construction office of Organisation Todt (OT) in Berlin, and therefore Speer's deputy in the OT Franz Xaver Dorsch, was responsible for the planning and organization of the project.Brief A. Hitlers an A. Speer (21. April 1944), Bundesarchiv Koblenz, R 3/1576, p. 131: ‚ÄûIch beauftrage den Leiter der OT-Zentrale, Ministerialdirektor Dorsch unter Beibehaltung seiner sonstigen Funktionen im Rahmen Ihres Aufgabenbereiches mit der Durchf√ºhrung der von mir befohlenen sechs J√§gerbauten.‚Äú On site the \\"OT- Einsatzgruppe Deutschland VI\\" (OT-Task Force Germany VI) supervised the construction from their offices in Ampfing, Mettenheim and Ecksberg at M√ºhldorf. Architect Bruno Hofmann was the \\"OT Oberbauleiter\\" (Chief Construction Leader). The technical aspects of the construction were assigned to the company (P & Z). Other companies worked on the project as subcontractors. P & Z had already been active in the area of M√ºhldorf in the 1920s, with the building of the Inn Canal. Almost 200 employees of the company were sent to M√ºhldorf for the project, where they operated as the OT unit Polensky & Z√∂llner, Bautrupp 773. The P & Z leader at the construction site was the engineer Karl Gickeleiter. The cost of the project has been estimated at almost 26 million Reichsmarks (equivalent to million ‚Ç¨).M√ºller (2006), p. 14M√ºller (2006), p. 13  Workforce  Survivors of the M√ºhldorf concentration camp upon liberation by the US army in 1945 A huge workforce was necessary for the construction project. P & Z used a total of 200 of its own workers, about 800 to 1000 workers from their affiliated Soviet companies, and 200 to 300 Italian workers.Raim (1992), p. 109 This group of about 1,500 was vastly inadequate if the project was to be completed on schedule. Therefore, it was decided that forced labor would be employed, as was common under the Nazis for projects of this magnitude. A large portion of the forced workers were prisoners of the M√ºhldorf concentration camp. Further labor camps were built by the OT to house them in the M√ºhldorfer Hart, Ampfing, Mettenheim and Ecksberg. A large number of Soviet prisoners of war also made up the forced laborers. Overall more than 10,000 workers were assigned to the Weingut I construction site. As a rule, two shifts of 4,000 men apiece worked on the project. According to the records of P & Z the POWs worked a total of 322,513 hours; the concentration camp prisoners, 2,831,974. The company was paid 1,892,656.20 Reichsmarks by the SS and the OT.Aussage des Buchhalters von Polensky & Z√∂llner (Johann H√§uschen) im M√ºhldorf-Prozess, Mikrofilm 123a/4, p. 139ff, Bayerisches Hauptstaatsarchiv M√ºnchen  Preparations  Adolf Hitler's orders of 21 April 1944 gave official approval for the commencement of work on the structure. Next the necessary ground for the project was confiscated without compensation. Around the middle of May the OT established its offices in the Ecksberg Foundation's (Stiftung Ecksberg) building complex. The Ecksberg Foundation, a home for the mentally ill, had been taken over by the state in 1938. It was uninhabited by this time, as the Nazis had soon thereafter murdered some 248 to 342 of those in the foundation's care as part of the Action T4 killing program.History of the Ecksberg Foundation (in German) At the same time the OT erected its first barracks camp. Afterward the required construction machinery was little by little supplied to M√ºhldorf. The equipment had to be brought together from sources throughout the Reich and its occupied territories, which was an especially complicated endeavor given the military situation.Raim (1992), p. 112 Nonetheless a concrete factory, a carpentry shop, a gravel sorting plant and further facilities had to be built. Besides these additional smaller bunkers intended to serve as air raid shelters were erected before construction on the main site began.M√ºller (2006), p. 17 For the transportation of material to and from the site the Reichsbahn laid down a network of siding that was connected to the Munich- M√ºhldorf line.M√ºller (2006), p. 18 Upon completion the entire bunker was to be covered with soil and planted over with trees and bushes, but considering the scale of the project it was hardly possible to effectively camouflage it from aerial reconnaissance during the construction process. Efforts to that effect were therefore not especially thorough. Indeed, the site was hard to miss, and the USAF took several aerial photos of it in February 1945 during reconnaissance prior to the bombardment of the airfield at Mettenheim and the train yard at M√ºhldorf. The site was discovered upon examination of the photos, as an overhead view of main bunker drawn in March 1945 and labeled \\"MUHLDORF (GERMANY) SEMI-BURIED INSTALLATION\\" attests.Bankel 111 The site was never bombed, however. The reasons why are unclear. One reason could be that the existence of the work camp was known and that the Allies did not want to risk bombing it by accident. It may also have been known that its completion was unlikely and thus other targets presented a higher priority.Raim (1992), p. 136-138  Process  Illustration showing part of the construction process. The gravel fill over which the arch has been formed (C) is dumped in the center of the arch by excavators (B), where it is poured into minecarts waiting in the extraction tunnel below (A). The dotted line above the arch indicates the projected thickness, which was never attained The actual work on Weingut I began in July 1944. According to plans, the bunker would be made up of 12 arches stretching east to west in a barrel vault 400 meters long and 85 meters wide. The arches would have an internal height of 32.2 m, 19.2 m of which was under the ground level. Their thickness reached 3 meters, and would have eventually reached 5 meters through a further concrete pour.M√ºller (2006), p. 18f. For the building of the bunker an effective and simple new procedure was employed. First an underground \\"extraction tunnel\\", fitted with a single train track and a gated roof, was built along the entire length of the planned bunker. Next the foundations for the abutments, which were up to 17 m thick, were dug. The gravel extracted from the foundations was piled up between the foundations to support the arches while they were being built, essentially serving as formwork instead of traditional wooden scaffolding. As each arch was completed, the gravel beneath it was dug out and dumped through the gates of the extraction tunnel into waiting mine carts, which would then be taken away. When the tunnel had been completely uncovered it would be disassembled and backhoes would continue the excavation to a depth of 19.2 meters. Starting from the east, one arch after another was erected in this way. Eight floors were to be erected beneath the arches, but this was only begun with the first arch. By the end of April 1945 only seven of the projected twelve arches were completed. In the last months of the war it was no longer possible to obtain the necessary materials and workers in order to stay on schedule.M√ºller (2006), p. 20ff. War's end and afterward  Capture and demolition The construction site as it was found by US forces in May 1945 When the 47th tank battalion of the 14th Armored Division reached M√ºhldorf in the early days of May 1945, the construction area and all related facilities were placed under US military administration. The company was allowed to dismantle and remove its construction equipment, and the Reichsbahn took up the tracks that led to the complex. Next the army decided to use the grounds as a bomb test site in order to determine the effectiveness of the bunker:Geschichtswerkstatt M√ºhldorf (ed.): Das Bunkergel√§nde im M√ºhldorfer Hart - die Fakten - Die Opfer - Die T√§ter. Geschichtswerkstatt, M√ºhldorf 1999, p. 2 This proposal was accepted and in the summer of 1947 the command for the demolition was issued. 125 tonnes of TNT were used for the demolition, which destroyed six of the seven completed arches and damaged the seventh. The last remaining arch of the Weingut I is one of seven that were completed out of a planned twelve. Here it is seen from the east, looking out over the overgrown remains of several other arches  Trial  After the war the US Army's Dachau Military Tribunal prosecuted perpetrators of war crimes in connection with the Weingut I project and the associated concentration and labor camps in the , which was one of the Dachau Trials. Among the accused were members of Polensky & Z√∂llner's administration, including Karl Bachmann, Director of the Munich branch of P & Z; Karl Gickeleiter, who oversaw construction at the main site; and Otto Sperling, construction foreman. The sentencing was performed on 13 May 1947. The charges against Karl Bachmann were dropped, as his involvement in the maltreatment of the prisoners could not be proven. Gickeleiter was sentenced to a 20-year prison term, which would be reduced to 10 years in 1951 before he was released early on 19 July 1952. The death sentence against Sperling was shortly thereafter shortened to life imprisonment and later reduced even further before he was finally released on 20 July 1957.United States Army Investigation and Trial Records of War Criminals - United States of America v.

The grounds entered the public eye again in the 1980s, when rumors began to circulate that chemical agents of the Wehrmacht had been stored in the tunnels of the complex after the war. This was not confirmed by the authorities until 1987; the chemicals, including CLARK 2, were subsequently removed.\\"Chemische Kampfstoffe im M√ºhldorfer Hart\\", Geschichtswerkstatt M√ºhldorf e.V. In 1992, the Bundesverm√∂gensverwaltung (Federal Property Administration, an agency that has since been superseded by the Bundesanstalt f√ºr Immobilienaufgaben) proposed to demolish the bunker. Although the communities of Mettenheim and Ampfing endorsed the demolition, many others opposed the proposal, and it was rejected by the government of Upper Bavaria.\\"Geschichte des Bunkers\\", M√ºhldorfer Anzeiger, 24 May 1999 In the meantime the bunker grounds had been added to the Bavarian list of monuments as a memorial to the victims of Nazi atrocities. Today the M√ºhldorf District Catholic Education Center (Katholische Kreisbildungswerk M√ºhldorf) administers occasional tours of the bunker grounds and the former concentration camp.M√ºller (2006), p. 29ff.

Weli Oya has been affected by the Sri Lankan civil war and government colonization programs. Weli Oya was traditionally known as Manal Aru before the launch of government Sinhala colonization programs and the 1984 Manal Aru massacres, where the Tamil population was progressively driven out. A body of running water moving to a lower level in a channel on land is called Manal Aru in Tamil. It is hemmed between Anuradhapura, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee and Vavunia Districts. It is called the \\"border village\\" (s) since the territory north of Weli Oya was previously under the control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Today 18 villages in Weli Oya. 3,336 families and 11,189 people living in this settlement division. Majority of them are Sinhalese. History Manal Aru A typo on the map has Manal Aru written as Manu Aru in 1989 This area was known as Manal Aru. Manal in Tamil means sand, Aru in Tamil means river. A body of running water moving to a lower level in a channel on land is called Manal Aru in Tamil. A total of 13,288 Tamil families living in 42 villages for generations including Kokkulai Grama Sevakar Division (1516 Tamil families), Kokku ‚ÄìThoduvai Grama Sevakar Division (3306 Tamil families), Vavunia North Grama Sevakar Division (1342 Tamil families), Other Divisions of Mullaitivu District including Naiyaru and Kumulamunai ( 2011 Tamil families). These Traditional Tamil farming villages interspersed with small and large farms owned by Tamils or held on long lease by Tamil-owned business enterprises. The lease for 99 years was granted by the government in 1965. The extent of individual holdings varied from ten to fifty acres. Business concerns held large farms and 16 of them were a thousand acres and more. Among the large farms were: Navalar farm, Ceylon Theatres farm, Kent farm, Railway Group Farm, Postmaster Group Farm and Dollar Farm. Colonization in 1984 Tamil families were living in 42 villages for generations were asked to vacate their homes and farmlands within 48 hours or face eviction by force in case of default. The Military went around these villages in armored trucked and made loud announcement over public address systems mounted on the trucks. The Military also announced the government has cancelled the 99 years lease in respect of the lands given to 14 Tamil entrepreneurs. Tamil opposition to settlement in the area by Sinhalese led to violence through the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam which attacked the Kent and Dollar Farm settlement at Weli Oya, killing 62. After settlements inhabited by ethnic Sinhalese near Maduru Oya Basin in Vadamunai, Eastern Province began to encroach on state land creating a controversy the Sinhalese were ejected from the east and resettled along a line from Padaviya to Nedunkerni in the north, in the Mullaitivu district with jungles being cleared and new roads being opened from Padaviya to Dollar Farm, Kumbakarnan Malai, Ariyakundam, Kokkuchchankulam, Kokkuttoduwai and Veddukkan malai. The project was done with the resources and vehicles of the Army, Agrarian Services, Illmenite Corporation, Tobacco Corporation and Petroleum Corporation. Despite its scale the project began suddenly without the knowledge of either the residents or Government Agents of Vavuniya or Mullaitivu including AGAs Land Officers. Further the use of convicts in the project affected nearby villages which were inhabited by Tamils and several crimes ranging from robbery to rape committed by convict workers were reported. Manal Aru becomes Weli Oya in 1988 - Extra ordinary Gazette notification The traditional Tamil region known as Manal Aru named as Weli Oya (Manal in Tamil translated into Sinhalese becomes Weli; Aru in Tamil translated into Sinhalese Oya) in Sinhala by an extra ordinary gazette notification dated 16 April 1988. Weli Oya was proclaimed the 26th District of Sri Lanka. Manal Aru was lies north of the Sinhala colonization scheme of Padavia and from 1987, this administrative division was part of Pathaviya and was brought under the Anuradhapura administrative district. Settlements in the Manal Aru began in 1984 as a dry zone farmer colony under the land Commission, but it was later acquired by the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Economic Agency in 1988 and declared as the Mahaweli ‚ÄòL‚Äô zone. The land was officially renamed Weli Oya on April 16, 1988. Colonisation after 2009 After the defeat of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority started to create a colonisation again in Manal Aru area in Weli oya project of the Mahaweli L-zone,Sensitive colonization in Manal Aru area in Mullaithivu district. The Director General of Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority Dharmasiri de Alwis has told the state-owned Dinamina newspaper Wednesday that 2500 families will be settled in Nedunkarni in Mullaithivu district under the Welioya project of the Mahaweli L-zone. Each family will be granted one acre for paddy cultivation, half an acre for coconut growing and one acre for the home garden. which covered the districts of Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Vavuniya and Anuradhapura. Sinhalese were settled in traditionally Tamil land, given land, money to build homes and security provided by the Special Task Force.The war - one year on Although the scheme covered four districts, administration was handled from the Sinhalese dominated Anuradhapura district. The scheme aroused much anger amongst the Tamils. Today the majority of the population in the area is Sinhalese.

After the Afghan government's investigation, the Afghan Defense Ministry announced an official death toll of 140 villagers. A government list with the names and ages of each of the 140 killed showed that 93 of those killed were children, while only 22 were adult males. A U.S. military investigation, on the other hand, estimated that 26 civilians were killed, but also admitted in its report that they would never be able to determine precisely how many civilians were killed by the operation. The U.S. military report concluded that at least two airstrikes on buildings should not have been ordered, and called for changes in the U.S. military's rules for using airstrikes as well as retraining. The report was also critical of the military for failing to assess battle damage quickly, and called for the creation of an investigative team that can respond within two hours of a reported incident. * May 19, 2009 ‚Äì In Lashkar Gah, Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan, Gurkhas mentoring police unit of the Royal Gurkha Rifles, called in British air strike after ambush from an suspected enemy position.

According to Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid, the insurgents opened valves to release fuel and lighten the loads, and villagers swarmed the trucks to collect the fuel despite warnings that they might be hit by an airstrike. According to some Afghan officials, the militants encouraged local people to take advantage of the situation. Word spread quickly and about 500 people from surrounding villages flocked to the trucks. At 2:30 A.M., a U.S. F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jet dropped two 500-pound bombs on the fuel tankers, triggering a huge fireball that incinerated many of the people nearby.

Soft Ergonomics is a subset of Ergonomics and Human Factors Engineering, a larger body of the study of human abilities for designing equipment and devices that fit the human body. Soft Ergonomics can be thus defined as the ability of any virtual interface(computer application, website, ATM options, parking meter etc.) to make it comfortable for the user to use the interface while working on the user's request. Overview Soft Ergonomics only deals with virtual interfaces. It tries to find a compromise between user expectations, system workflow and aesthetics. Users from various cultural and technological background are exposed to a common interface. The interface developer seeks to ensure that the interface does not harm the user psychologically, physiologically or emotionally. Soft Ergonomics generally takes into account the following human factors when building a virtual interface: 1\\\\. Physical Limitations: Not all who use a virtual interface are physically equal. If the designed interface only caters to right-handed individuals, or people within a certain height range then the interface might need a redesign. One of the leading discussion is with respect to visually impaired users. 2\\\\. Cognitive Abilities: If the product(software application, website) is designed for any casual user, then the designer should not expect that all users would be experts, with high cognitive abilities. The usage of the application should not need the user to know a lot of information prior to using the interface. For example, using an automated teller machine can require memorizing a pin number but not the account number. 3\\\\. Emotional Needs: The interface should be 'designed for the occasion' or context. It should not leave the user confused, either how to start using the interface or what to do when an error occurs. Confusion leads to frustration, which eventually builds stress in the body causing long term emotional damage. Criteria for Soft Ergonomics The following lists(non-exhaustive) some of the most common criteria for evaluating soft ergonomics. 1\\\\. Consistency: The design should be consistent across the entire application. Consistent sequence of actions, identical terminologies and platform conventions should be followed throughout the application. 2\\\\. Efficiency: The virtual interface should allow efficient use of user's time. The screens should load and display content within acceptable amount of time. The more than expected time a user has to wait, more stress is built into the human body causing long term damage. The interface should also have functionality for advanced users. While being non-obtrusive to novice users, accelerators or shortcuts should be available for experienced users. 3\\\\. Design: The system should preferably have minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing design. While this has no direct relation to the product or task in hand, minimalistic design help user easily consume the data and hence there is less stress on the human mind and aesthetically pleasing design increases the 'feel good' factor in the user. Following the principles of contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity will also help as they come naturally to humans. 4\\\\. Memory: User's memory load should be minimized. All information that a user needs from the application to perform a task should be presented or easily retrievable by the user. 5\\\\. Context Help: While the 'Help' menu and options should be non obstructive to the user, context help should be always available to the user.

The casualties were Afghans employed as security guards by the Afghan Technical Consultancy, the U.N. demining agency (Afghanistan is the most heavily mined country on the planet). The Taliban reported about 8 to 20 civilian casualties, unconfirmed by independent sources. * On October 10, 2001, the Sultanpur mosque in Jalalabad was bombed (BBC) twice ‚Äì once during prayer, and again when rescue workers returned to remove the wounded and the dead. Initial casualty estimates ranged from 15-70 in the first attack, and up to 120 in the second. This two-hit bombing was repeated later on November 19, when 32 people were killed in Shamshad and then the rescuers were hit again. Several other mosques were bombed later, such as the Kunduz mosque on October 12 and the particularly deadly bombing of the Kala Shah Pir village mosque on October 23. On the same day, the villages of Darunta, Torghar, and Farmada were bombed, killing between 28 and 100 people. * On October 11, 2001, the village of Karam was completely destroyed. (The Guardian) Reporters on the scene reported having to hold their noses due to the smell. Between 160 and 200 people, in addition to their livestock, were killed, as reported by the surviving villagers. In response, Donald Rumsfeld stated \\"We do not have information that validates any of that\\", but added that Washington's information on the ground was \\"imperfect\\". Al-Qaeda was believed to have training camps and ammunition storage tunnels in the area around Karam. * On October 17, 2001, downtown Kandahar was targeted with bombs and rockets in the area around a ministry building; the bombing destroyed several dozen stores and homes, and killing between 40 and 47 people. This was repeated the following day elsewhere in Kandahar, where bombs near the Kepten intersection destroyed a bazaar and killed between 10 and 47 additional people. This began a relatively deadly few days, where 40 people were killed in the Kabul area on the 18th, several dozen people were killed in Tarin Kot on the 19th, and 60-70 were killed in Herat and 50 killed in Kandahar on the 20th. * On October 21, 2001, the casualty rate peaked with the bombing of a hospital and mosque in Herat. The 200-bed hospital, used for both military and civilian patients, was reportedly not the target; the target was away. Approximately 100 bodies were found among the wreckage. On the same day, over 20 people (including 9 children) died when the tractor trailer used by several families to flee Tarin Kut was bombed (similar to an event on October 24); a stray bomb in the Parod Gajadad district of Khair Khana destroyed two homes; in another district of Khair Khana, 18 people were killed when 17 homes were destroyed by a bomb that missed a military base by 1/2 mile (800 m); 5 people from Kabul's Kaluezaman Khan neighborhood were killed; an 8-year-old girl was killed in Macroyan, Kabul; 11 people were killed in Tarin Kut; and 3 were killed in Kandahar city. The following day, the casualty rate didn't fall much, with the coalition stepping up the targeting of fuel trucks and the accidental bombing of homes and shops in several cities, killing well over 100 people. * On October 23, 2001, the village of Chowkar Kariz was destroyed; testimony from the survivors indicated a casualty number between 52 and 93. Times journalist Paul Rogers reported that \\"not a single house has been left intact\\" and that \\"evidence that this remote spot had ever been used for military or terrorist purposes is non-existent.\\" In the face of opposition from human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, U.S. officials continued to claim that the town was a \\"fully legitimate target\\" and that \\"the people there are dead because we wanted them dead.\\" This was the last major case of civilian casualties for the next few weeks, as incidents dropped to an average of four per day and an average of about 8 casualties per said attack. The most lethal attack between the 23rd and November 4, 2001 was an attack on residential areas in Kabul on October 29 that took 25 lives. * On October 26, 2001, twenty-three people were killed in a bombing raid in the village Thori in the Urozgan province. * On November 5, 2001, an upswing in civilian casualties occurred with major attacks on Kabul and villages in the Balkh province. The most deadly of the attacks occurred in Ogopruk village, near Mazar e Sharif, where 36 people in a residential area were killed by stray bombs. The daily civilian casualty rate remained over 50 through November 10, where it peaked with attacks on three villages near Khakrez that killed approximately 125 people. * On November 13, 2001, an American missile went \\"awry\\", according to the Pentagon, and destroyed the Al-Jazeera bureau in Kabul. In (November 27, 2003 ‚Äì Hearst Newspapers, www.commondreams.org/scriptfiles/views03/1127-07.htm). * On November 17, 2001, 62 people were killed in the bombing of a Madrassa in Khost, while 42 nomads were killed near Maiwand, two families with a total of 30 people were killed in Charikar village, 28 people were killed in Zani Khel village, and other scattered attacks took another 13 lives. * November 18, 2001 proved to be one of the more deadly days of bombing in the conflict. Scores of Gypsies were killed in Kundar, 100-150 people were killed in villages near Khanabad in an attack described by witnesses as \\"carpet bombing\\", 35 people were killed in Shamshad village, and 24 in Garikee Kah village. Several of these villages were near the front lines, and were likely hit by stray bombs. A similar error occurred on November 20 when 40 people were killed as their mud houses collapsed from a stray bomb in a village near the Kunduz front line. * An incident, similar to the October 9 incident, killed 12 people at another mine clearing facility. * On November 25, 2001, 92 people (including 18 women and 7 children) were killed by bombing in Kandahar. On the same day, 70 people were killed when cluster bombs were dropped in the Kunduz area, as well as scattered deaths in Adha village and Takhta-Pal. * On December 1, 2001, about 100 people were killed by 25 bombs in their houses in the village of Kama Ado. Kandahar city reported numerous civilian casualties, while four trucks and five busses carrying passengers fleeing the war were hit on a highway, killing 30. Talkhel and Balut villages suffered 50 casualties, while Chperagem village suffered 28. About 20 people were killed in the Agam district, while 15 people died in refugee vehicles in Arghisan, and over 30 people died in the Jada area near Herat. It proved to be another particularly lethal day in the conflict for civilians. The subsequent days were little improved. About 150 civilians died across the country on December 2 in a variety of villages. In the same week, over 300 villagers in the white mountains near Tora Bora, as US forces attacked villages which fighters passed through, hoping to kill any which remained in the area. * After the Tora Bora bombing campaign, the effort dispersed to kill Taliban and al-Qaeda members fleeing with their families, and focused on the Paktia and Paktika provinces. Numerous villages were hit shortly after the leaders passed through, leaving a chain of destruction following their path. The first place to be struck was Mashikhel in Paktia, in what inaccurate intelligence had said was a Taliban base. The city's mosque (Saqawa) was hit, killing 10 and injuring 12. The bombing then moved to Mashkhel, killing another 16 civilians. On December 20, 2001, U.S. AC-130 gunships and Navy fighters attacked and destroyed a convoy in Afghanistan believed to be carrying the leaders and struck surrounding villages. The convoy turned out to be carrying tribal elders heading to the inauguration ceremony for Hamid Karzai; between 20 and 65 people died. Overnight on the 27th, US forces struck at the village of Naka. Between 25 and 40 people were killed, 5-25 houses were destroyed, and 4-60 people were injured; however, US forces got one of their targets (the Taliban's Minister of Security, Qari Ahmadullah) and two sons of a commander they were also seeking (Maulvi Ahmed Taha). Taha himself was not killed in the attack. The next night, the village of Shekhan was bombed, killing 15 civilians and destroying three houses. * The following day (December 31, 2001), one of the largest single incidents of civilian casualties in the entire war occurred: at least one U.S. fighter jet, a B-52 bomber and two helicopters swooped on Qalaye Niazi near Gardez, killing over 100 people. The area was littered with craters; one person (Janat Gul) recounted how all other 24 members of her family were killed. Body parts were reported scattered throughout the streets; the United Nations has confirmed that all of the dead were civilians. 2002 * On July 1, 2002, 48 people at a wedding party in a village in Oruzgan province were killed, and a further 117 injured, in a bombing raid. New figures from October 2006 say that 46 people were killed. The name of the village is Del Rawad, though early reports gave its name as Kakrakai or Kakrak. Gunfire meant to celebrate the wedding was apparently mistaken by US military for hostile gunfire. A B-52 bomber and AC-130 gunship were both involved in the incident, which reportedly went on for over an hour. The victims included many women and children. Some survivors were treated in Mirwai Hospital in Kandahar, and at least four children were treated at military hospitals in Bagram and Kandahar. The incident resulted in a formal protest, and later a warning, from the Afghan government. An anti-American rally was held in Kabul on July 5 as a protest against the incident. On July 3, US President George Bush expressed \\"deep condolences for the loss of human life\\", and US authorities later stated that the area affected by the bombing would be rebuilt. Several inquiries into the incident were undertaken. According to The Times, a preliminary UN report has stated that US forces arrived at the scene of the bombing raid and removed vital evidence. 2003 * February 2003 ‚Äì At least 17 civilians, mostly women and children, were killed in coalition bombing raids in a mountainous region Helmand province. * February 2003 ‚Äì Reuters reported that according to locals, 8 civilians were killed in the Baghran Valley area of Helmand province when a U.S. bomber and gunship attacked the area. * April 9, 2003 ‚Äì Eleven Afghans, seven of them women, were killed and one wounded when a stray U.S. laser- guided bomb hit a house on the outskirts of Shkin in Paktika province. * September 2003 ‚Äì At least eight civilians died in a U.S. air strike in the Naw Bahar district of the Zabul province that also killed a Taliban commander. * October 30, 2003 ‚Äì In a small hamlet near the village of Aranj in the Waygal district of Nuristan province, Afghanistan, six people of the same family were killed when a house was bombarded by U.S. warplanes.

The gamma-ray emission lasted at least 28 minutes, which is unusually long. Follow-up observations of the burst's afterglow by the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observatories were unable to determine the object's distance using spectroscopic methods. In papers published in the journal Nature, two different groups of astronomers proposed different theories about the event's origin. Sergio Campana's group proposes that the event was caused by a comet crashing onto a neutron star within our own galaxy. Christina Th√∂ne's group prefers a more conventional supernova mechanism, involving a merger between a helium star and a neutron star at a distance of about 5.5 billion light years from Earth.  Observations  The gamma ray burst, in the constellation Andromeda, was first detected by the NASA Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission at 18:38 UT on December 25, 2010. The gamma-ray emission had a duration of at least 28 minutes, which is unusually long. After news of the gamma-ray burst was sent to other observatories, the longer-wavelength \\"afterglow\\" of the burst was monitored by on-ground observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope. After the unusually long duration of gamma emissions, x-ray emissions in the afterglow continued for just two days, an unusually short duration for this phase. Optical emissions observed over the first 10 days were characterized as those of \\"an expanding, cooling blackbody with a large initial radius\\". A faint light source appeared about 10 days after the burst and reached its maximum brightness 30 days after its appearance; observers described this light source as looking like a supernova. On January 6, 2011, the 10m Keck-I telescope equipped with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) conducted spectroscopic measurements of the host galaxy of GRB 101225A. A 900s spectrum was obtained; it consisted of blue and red channels, covering the wavelength ranges ~320‚Äì550 nm and ~500‚Äì820 nm, respectively. Isotropic energy was estimated at (7.8 ¬± 1.6) erg from the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) data. The unusual characteristics of the afterglow led astronomers to generate novel hypotheses to explain the event. Observers were unable to ascertain the burst's distance from Earth, and the two alternative hypotheses of its origin place the event at radically different distances.  Hypotheses  Christina Th√∂ne, of the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia in Spain, was lead author of a paper that proposed that the burst occurred in a binary system where a neutron star orbited a normal helium star that had just entered its red giant phase, which had enormously expanded its outer atmosphere. During the expansion, the red giant star engulfed the neutron star, resulting in both the ejection of the giant's atmosphere and rapid tightening of the neutron star's orbit. Once the two stars became wrapped in a common envelope of gas, the neutron star may have merged with the giant's core after just five orbits, or about 18 months. The end result of the merger was the birth of a black hole or a magnetar and the production of oppositely directed jets of particles moving at nearly the speed of light, followed by a weak supernova. The particle jets produced gamma rays. Jet interactions with gas ejected before the merger explain much of the burst's different nature. Based on this interpretation, the event took place about 5.5 billion light-years away (redshift 0.33), and the team has detected what may be a faint galaxy at the right location. An alternative hypothesis, offered by a team led by Sergio Campana of the Brera Astronomical Observatory (INAF), proposes that GRB 101225A was produced by a comet-like object that fell into a neutron star located in our own galaxy, only some 10,000 light-years from Earth. In this model, the comet-like object falls onto the neutron star and is disrupted by tidal forces. Hard X-ray emission (the burst) results from the first matter falling onto the neutron star. X-ray emission and initial variations detected by Swift are attributed to clumps of material striking the star as the disc formed around it. Then the disk cools down and emits only at UV and optical wavelengths. More recently, at the 2013 Huntsville Gamma-ray Burst Symposium, several scientists proposed that GRB 101225A, along with GRB 111209A and 121027A are part of a new class of gamma ray bursts, termed ultra-long bursts and caused by the collapse of low metallicity blue supergiant stars. Andrew Levan and his colleagues used the Gemini North Telescope to determine that GRB 101225A was 7 billion light years distant Dying Supergiant Stars Implicated in Hours-long Gamma-Ray Bursts http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/supergiant-stars.html April 16, 2013.

This greater distance gives it a much higher energy level, which combined with longer duration and an absence of a supernova signature have led scientists, such as Bruce Gendre to suggest that these ultra-long bursts are the result of collapsing blue supergiant stars.Dying Supergiant Stars Implicated in Hours- long Gamma-Ray Bursts http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/supergiant-stars.html April 16, 2013.

As a result of protests, demonstrations, court arrests, self immolations and deaths of Shia youth, under the leadership of shia ulemas, the Shias were permitted by the government to stage an Azadari procession in January 1998 (21st of Ramzan). A limited number of processions are allowed, and security is tight.No new Muharram procession allowed in Lucknow , TwoCircles.net, 16 December 2010 Azadari during Nawabi period Nawab Asafudaula used to spend 60,000 Rupees on a single Muharram.Islam in India and Pakistan By Annemarie Schimmel, BRILL, 1982 Communal riots and ban on azadari in Lucknow During Nawabi time Azadari practices were even observed by non-Shias, particularly Sunni Muslims of lower stratum. Sleeman, who spent considerable time in Lucknow notes that the Shias and the Sunnis participated with equal enthusiasm in practices of Muharram.Communal riots in post-independence India By Asgharali Engineer, Universities Press, 1991Rallying around the Qaum: The Muslims of the United Provinces and the movement for Pakistan, 1935‚Äî1947 By Venkat Dhulipala, ProQuest, 2008Shi'a Islam in Colonial India: Religion, Community and Sectarianism Justin Jones, Cambridge University Press, 24 October 2011 Riots took place in 1908, 1930s, 1968, 1969, 1974 and 1977. The Government of Uttar Pradesh banned the processions in 1977. Even the Shias and Sunnis concede that the Shia-Sunni conflict in Lucknow is not long-standing. They date it back to start of the 20th century. Riot of 1908 and Piggot committee The first Shia‚ÄìSunni riot occurred in 1908, when a tazia procession of Shias was attacked by a group of militant Sunnis hiding in a Sunni mosque. After which a four-member committee under the chairmanship of Justice T. C. Piggot, an ICS officer and a judge of High Court was formed to look into the matter. The conclusion of committee was that \\"the attempt to transform the tazia processions in honour of first four Caliphs was an innovation. \\"The personal knowledge of those members of the Committee who are well acquainted with Lucknow is on the whole favourable to Shia view.\\" The Committee also recommended that there should be general prohibition against the organised recitation of Madhe-Sahaba verses on three days, viz., ashura (the tenth day of Muharram), Chehlum (the fortieth day of ashura), and the twenty-first day of Ramzan. The Government accepted the report of the Committee. Tensions in 1930s, riot of 1935 and Allsop committee In 1935, on the day of Chehlum, some sunnis defied the order and recited the Madhe-Sahaba, which resulted in immediate tensions and skirmishes between Shias and Sunnis. For three months Sunnis built pressure by defying prohibitory orders. When other re- conciliatory efforts failed, the government appointed the Allsop Committee under Justice Allsop of Allahabad High Court to consider the question of public recitation of the Madhe-Sahaba afresh. The Allsop Committee reiterated the position of Piggott Committee. Eventually, on 28 March 1938, the Government published the Allsop Committee's report and stood by it. Civil disobedience movement of 1938 & sanctions on Madhe-Sahaba during Barawafat The Sunnis were dissatisfied with the decision of Government to adhere to suggestions made in Allsop Committee report and started a civil disobedience movement. In late April 1938, Zafrul Malik and Abdul Shakur, the two main leaders of Madhe-Sahaba movement with 26 eminent Sunni ulemas declared in a public meeting that recitation of Madhe-Sahaba could not be restricted for even a single day. The next day, bricks were thrown at a Shia Tazia procession in Patanala; 10 people were killed and several dozens injured. Next several months saw a buildup in tensions between Shias and Sunnis. To defend themselves and coordinate their civil disobedience campaigns, the Sunnis formed the Anjuman Tahaffuz-e-Namus Sahaba and the Shias formed the Anjuman Tanzimul Momineen. After negotiations with Sunnis, the Congress Government issued, on 31 March 1939, a communique which stated that \\"the Sunnis will in any circumstances be given the opportunity of reciting Madhe-Sahaba at a public meeting, and in a procession every year on the barawafat day subject to the condition that the time, place and route thereof shall be fixed by district authorities.\\" But the Government failed to engage Shias in negotiations or inform them beforehand of the ruling. Civil disobedience movement, riot of 1939 and ban on Madhe-Sahaba and Tabarra Crowds of Shia volunteer arrestees assembled in the compound of Asaf-ud-Daula Imambada (Bara Imambara) in preparation of tabarra, April 1939 The Shias initiated a civil disobedience movement as a result of the ruling. Some 1,800 Shias publicly protested, including prominent Shia figures such as Syed Ali Zaheer (newly elected MLA from Allahabad-Jaunpur), the Princes of the royal family of Awadh, the son of Maulana Nasir a respected Shia mujtahid (the eldest son, student and designated successor of Maulana Nasir Hussain), Maulana Sayed Kalb-e- Husain and his son Maulana Kalb-e-Abid (both ulema of Nasirabadi family) and the brothers of Raja of Salempur and the Raja of Pirpur, important ML leaders. It was believed that Maulana Nasir himself besides the top ranking ML leaders such as Raja of Mahmudabad and Raja of Pirpur would together court arrest.Karim ur Raza Khan to Jinnah, 27 April 1939, Madhe Sahaba file, Qaid-i- zamPapaers. A conference arbitrated by Maulana Azad failed to produce a settlement. The next day was the Barawafat, and the Sunnis performed a Madhe- Sahaba procession. The Shias were also allowed a procession, and a riot occurred during which several people were killed. The district authorities banned the public recitation of Madhe-Sahaba and Tabarra in processions and meetings held in public places in 1940 (the following year). 1940s The Shia-Sunni problem of Lucknow persisted through the 1940s. 1950s In early 1950s too district administration kept refusing Madhe-Sahaba processions and counter processions and courts upheld such stands.Mohammad Siddiqui vs State Of U.P.

Pictures. Inspired by the silent comedies produced by Mack Sennett, the film reunites many of Sennett's former stars. Plot The story follows the cross-eyed Count Drewa Blanc (Ben Turpin), who arrives at the busy Keystone Hotel to judge a fashion show. In the hotel lobby, the chief of police (Ford Sterling), the mayor (Chester Conklin), and a gangster (Dewey Robinson) try to sway the Count's decision. Upstairs, the house detective (Hank Mann) investigates some marital shenanigans, some involving a vibrating exercise machine. The fashion show is held in a banquet hall, where the hotel manager (Bert Roach) introduces the contestants. The winner is chosen, but the myopic Count awards the trophy to the wrong woman. The winner protests, \\"How dare you give it to her when I should get it!\\" She does‚Äîan airborne pie misses its target and hits her. This prompts a huge pie fight, and the hotel detective sends for the Keystone Kops. The Kops spring into action and encounter several detours and difficulties before crashing into the hotel. Keystone Hotel was staged so effectively that later silent- comedy tribute films have included footage from Keystone Hotel without the soundtrack as an \\"authentic\\" Keystone comedy. The film was so successful that Warner Bros. wanted to make a series with the same principals, but the actors' agents demanded too much money so the idea was abandoned. Keystone Hotel was reissued to theaters in 1947 and to the home-movie market in 1967.

Born in South Africa, Kahn moved to Israel where she lived on a kibbutz for many years before emigrating to Australia in 1998 and starting an events management business. On a vacation to South Africa, she was galvanised into action by a friend when visiting Soweto who told her that \\"she was responsible for electricity in Soweto\\". Kahn recalls that was the moment her life of purpose began. I knew I had to come back and do something meaningful for other people...\\" Building on her experience in corporate hospitality, she was shocked by the amount of food waste, although not initially aware of the relationship between food waste and environmental problems.  Oz Harvest  Kahn founded OzHarvest in 2004, initially with the support of people in the restaurant and catering industries in Sydney. It is a non-denominational charity that rescues excess food which would otherwise be discarded and distributes it to charities supporting the vulnerable around Australia. After lobbying for changes to civil liability and health legislation that prevented food donors from supplying excess food, the legislation was changed in four Australian states starting in New South Wales in 2005.NSW Civil Liability Act 2002 - Sect 58C Kahn says OzHarvest \\"delivers the equivalent of 25 million meals a year that would otherwise be dumped\\".Food delivery from OzHarvest to St James' Church, Sydney to support its Sister Freda mission to disadvantaged people Kahn was behind the creation of the NEST program ‚Äì Nutrition, Education & Sustenance Training ‚Äì which aims to educate vulnerable Australians about nutrition and healthy eating, providing valuable life skills to disadvantaged and marginalised communities. In her advocacy, Kahn highlights the broader global issues affecting food waste. In 2017 OzHarvest for the fifth year partnered with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) on the Think.Eat.Save Campaign. In December 2014 Ronni travelled to attend the Sustainable Innovation Forum in Lima, Peru as part of the Think.Eat.Save campaign - held at the margins of the UNFCCC Climate Change Conference. The event served to remind delegates of the level that food waste contributes to dangerous greenhouse gasses which affect climate change and the amount of resources squandered when food is wasted. She has said that \\"If food waste was a country, it would be the third biggest emitter of carbon and methane gas after the US and China\\". In 2018, Kahn was looking for a location in Sydney to establish a refettorio in collaboration with Italian chef and restaurateur Massimo Bottura, whom she had met in 2016 and who established a series not-for-profit restaurants that aim ‚Äúto empower communities to fight food waste through social inclusion‚Äù. The plan is for OzHarvest to look after the site, operations, volunteers and supply of rescued food as well as communicate with agencies that supply food to people in need. In 2020, the chosen site for the OzHarvest Refettorio was announced as 481 Crown Street, Sydney. Awards Ronni Kahn has been acknowledged as a leader in the fields of entrepreneurship, social impact and innovation. Her contributions have been widely recognised through numerous awards including: * 2010 Australia's Local Hero, Australian of the Year Awards, in recognition of her work founding OzHarvest. * 2010 Enriched List, American Express * 2011 InStyle Woman of Style Award - Community /Charity category * 2012 Veuve Clicquot Award Business Woman Tribute Award for Innovation, Entrepreneurial Skill and Contribution to the Community * 2012 Ernst & Young Social Entrepreneur of the Year * 2017 BOSS magazine Top 21 True Leaders * 2017 Gourmet Traveller Outstanding Contribution to Hospitality * 2017 Griffith University Doctor of the University (honoris causa) * 2018 The Australian Financial Review 100 Women of Influence award for social enterprise and not-for-profit * 2019 Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).

He was the founder of Dhaka's first Bengali newspaper, The Azad.  Early life and education Khan was born in Hakimpur, 24 Parganas district of Bengal Presidency, British India (in present-day West Bengal) in 1868. He did not have a British education but studied at Calcutta Madrasah (now Aliah University). He entered the journalism profession at a very young age before becoming involved in politics.  Career   Journalism  Early in his career, he worked at newspapers Ahl-i-Hadith and Mohammadi Akhbar. Between 1908 and 1921, he worked as the editor of the Mohammadi and the Al-Islam. He published the Zamana and the Sebak between 1920 and 1922. Sebak was banned and Akram Khan was arrested on the basis that his anti- government editorials supported the Non-cooperation Movement and the Swadeshi movement. From October 1936, Akram Khan began publishing the newspaper The Azad, which generated support for the Muslim League in Bengal.  Political career  Akram Khan was one of the founding members of the Muslim League in 1906. As a member of the Anjuman-i-Ulama-i-Bangala, he was involved in the Khilafat and Non-cooperation Movement from 1918 to 1924. He was elected secretary of the All India Khilafat Committee at the conference held at Ahsan Manzil in Dhaka in 1920, which was attended by other eminent Khilafat Movement leaders like Abul Kalam Azad, Maniruzzaman Islamabadi and Mujibur Rahman. Akram was responsible for collecting funds for the Ottoman caliphate. During 1920‚Äì1923, he organised public meetings in different parts of Bengal to propagate the cause of the Khilafat and the Non-cooperation Movement. As a believer in Hindu-Muslim amity, Akram Khan supported Chitta Ranjan Das's Swaraj Party in Kolkata in 1922, and also the Bengal pact in 1923. But due to the communal riots of 1926‚Äì1927 and other contemporary political developments, Akram Khan lost his faith in Indian nationalist politics and left both the Swaraj Party and Congress. From 1929 to 1935, Khan was deeply involved in the Krishak Praja Party. However, he left peasant politics in 1936 and became an activist for the Muslim League. He was a member of the central working committee of the League until 1947. After the partition of India in 1947, he opted for East Bengal and settled in Dhaka. He was the President of Muslim League (East Pakistan) until he retired from politics in 1960. Akram Khan was also involved in the Bengali Language Movement of 1952. He was also a founding member of Pakistan's Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional body formed in 1962.  Death  Khan died on 18 August 1969. He was buried at the Ahl-i- Hadith Bangshal mosque at Lalbagh PS in Dhaka.

He received a Lloyd's List Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010.Lloyd's List Global Award Winners 2010 He is a director of Clarksons plc, the world's largest shipbroker.Clarksons plc Early life & education Stopford was born in Bolton, Lancashire in 1947, son of a clergyman. He was educated at Prestfelde School, Shrewsbury and Denstone College, Staffordshire. In 1966 he won an Abbott Scholarship to Keble College, Oxford in 1969 where he studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) under Adrian Darby, James Griffin, Paul Hayes and Basil Mitchell. Stopford went on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Economics from Birkbeck College, part of the University of London, which he completed in 1979.  Career  Martin Stopford first became involved with the shipping business in 1971 when he joined Maritime Transport Research, a London-based shipping consultancy. He studied seaborne trade, culminating in the publication, with colleagues Jack Griffiths, Sue Bland and John Stapleton of a six volume series of reports ‚ÄúDry Cargo Ship Demand to 1980‚Äù covering the movement of 220 separate commodity trades by sea. In 1977, Stopford joined British Shipbuilders as Group Economist. In 1981 he became Director of Business Development, where his responsibility for the annual corporate plan drew him into the many problems of the 1980s depression in the shipping and shipbuilding industries. In 1988 Stopford was recruited by Chase Manhattan Bank as Global Shipping Economist, just as the ship finance business was re- discovering itself after the disastrous recession. Then in August 1990, on the day Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he became MD of Clarkson Research. Over a 20-year period, Clarkson Research grew into a sizeable business with over 200 products, serving clients in shipping, shipbuilding, finance, marine equipment and offshore. In 2004 he joined the main Clarksons board. Academia In the late 1970s he started lecturing at Cambridge Academy of Transport and in 1989 set up the Anatomy of Ship Finance course which he still leads. He also developed the International Commodity Trade and Transport (ICTC) module at the Centre for Shipping, Trade & Finance at CASS set up by Professor Costas GrammenosThe Costas Grammenos International Centre for Shipping, Trade and Finance in 1984. During the first term he added Shipping Economics and taught both courses until the early 1990s. In 2009 he was given an honorary Doctorate by Solent University and in 2010 he was the winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Lloyds List Global Shipping Awards Dinner. He is also a Visiting Professor at Cass Business School, Dalian Maritime University, Copenhagen Business School and Newcastle University.

The line had been closed that year after 124 years of operation, after the closure of the local AFFCO freezing works in the town.  The preserved line  The preserved line begins at the northern end of the Lepperton Railway Yards (just past the main line turnout) and continues parallel to the Marton - New Plymouth Railway for a few hundred meters before turning right towards the Waiongana Stream. After crossing the stream the line runs to the former Waitara Road station in Brixton. The line continues from here towards Waitara, passing underneath State Highway 3 at Big Jim's Overpass. Finally, the line drops into the Waitara Valley and into the township of Waitara, finishing just before the Waitara River. In Waitara, most of the infrastructure is gone with only the main line and one loop remaining in the yard.

The branch line has 8 level crossings along its length, all of which are protected by compulsory stop signs.

The trip takes 45 minutes return, including a stop at The Former Tahora Station on the return journey for refreshments. The railway also offers charter services by arrangement.WRPS website - charters Since around 2007, trains had only journeyed as far as the Waiongana River bridge due to the deterioration of the sleepers on the structure. In April 2014 the bridge was re-sleepered and maintenance completed on the main bridge structure (including removing the former Waitara town water pipes from the side). This has allowed trains to return to the entire branch line (and a proposed loop at the former Sentry Hill station site). In 2019 the society entered into a lease to the Lepperton railway sidings (but not the main line and loop) which will allow locomotives to switch ends of the train. As part of this agreement, the society is building a new linking track to bypass the Kiwirails network which is under Centralised Traffic Control.

Education Saraighat College is situated in Changsari along with dozen of Primary and High Schools. CIPET Central Institute of Plastic Engineering and Technology is also situated here Health care With the existing health care facilities, state government had on 28 June 2016 handed over more than 571 acres of land at Changsari to the Centre to set up the 750-bedded super-speciality hospital AIIMS at an expenditure of around Rs 1,000 crore. Controversy Handing over the plot at Changsari to the Centre has triggered a series of protests at Raha (Central Assam) and senior citizens of the area had gone on a hunger strike. The violent protests also witnessed killing of one person at Raha on 15 July 2016. The AIIMS Demand Committee of Raha filed a petition challenging the official move to set up the AIIMS at Changsari, which led The National Green Tribunal (NGT) of India to instruct halting of construction work temporarily. Committee and others alleged that construction in current site will have grave environmental hazards, huge natural wetland (Jalah Beel) will have to be completely filled up which may have grave consequences in future including abnormal flooding of the adjoining areas and the highways to support their point, which is thoroughly rejected by Engineers forum. Engineers asserted that the Changsari site was selected by an expert committee constituted by the Union Government considering over thirty aspects and it cannot be dismissed as a non-feasible site. They said the expert committee examined the technical parameters, which included mandatory environmental impact assessment, accessibility, national and international connectivity, technical feasibility, comparative project cost analysis and existence of support infrastructure in the vicinity for the purpose of selecting the AIIMS site. They claim that the Jalah Beel is not a water body covered under The Guwahati Water Bodies (Preservation, Conservation and Protection) Act, 2008 and hence allegation that AIIMS construction would violate the said Act, is not based on facts. This Act has specifically notified the following water bodies in the Schedule I to IV - the Sarusala, Borsola, Silsako and the Deepor beels and Bondajan was added as Schedule V in the amended Act 2010. The permissible built-up construction in the area allotted to AIIMS is 50.92 per cent as per Table 14.2 of the notified Master Plan. The Building Construction Regulation Bye Laws 2014, restricts the ground coverage of such institutional buildings to 35 per cent as per clause 26 (1) (c). Therefore, the AIIMS construction would cover a maximum area of 35 per cent of the plot area and leave the balance 65 per cent as open space. The wetlands, hills, rivers, natural streams, forest constitute only 20.25 per cent of the plot area. Hence this area obviously need not be touched at all. Only \\"notified water bodies\\" under Guwahati Water Bodies (Preservation, Conservation and Protection) Act, 2008 and 2010 and \\"designated hills\\" under the Assam Hill Land and Ecological Sites (Protection and Management) Act 2006, are prohibited areas under the law. The law allows for scientific and regulated development of other areas as per laid down engineering stipulations. Further, they say, patients and specialised doctors often need to be flown in at short notice in life threatening situations. One can imagine the plight of a top level specialist or emergency patient being caught in water logging at Jorabat or in the numerous road blockades and bandhs en route to any other location in Upper or Middle Assam.

He was awarded the Military Cross. During several days of severe fighting he kept in close touch with the battalion, working unceasingly without rest during the whole period, dressing the wounded including the French. He showed great initiative in establishing forward regimental aid posts, reconnoitring their sites beforehand under heavy hostile shell fire, thus greatly assisting the rapid evacuation of casualties.

It runs Android 4.1. The Transformer Prime was announced by Asus on 9 November 2011. It was released in Taiwan on 1 December 2011, and in Canada and the United States during the week of 19 December 2011.  Features  The Eee Pad Transformer Prime is a tablet computer with a 10.1\\" IPS+ multi- touch screen with a resolution of 1280x800 and an Nvidia system-on-a-chip (SoC). It has an 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi module and a microSD card reader. The optional docking keyboard features full QWERTY keys, trackpad, one USB 2.0 port and one Secure Digital (SD) card reader as well as an additional battery that increases overall battery life from 12 to 18 hours. There is also a sleeve which protects the tablet when not in use. This has similarities with the , but folds in an origami like fashion.  Software  The Transformer Prime shipped with Android 3.2 Honeycomb. Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) update was released on 11 January 2012 for the Transformer Prime. It was then updated to Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean on 27 September 2012.  Reception  The tablet has been noted for its graphics performance in games optimized for the , with the water in Riptide GP prompting a description of \\"awesome\\". By contrast, file transfer speeds for writing were one of the slowest in tablets tested. A review unit was rooted in December 2011. Users of the device intending to install a custom ROM themselves were disappointed in January 2012 to discover a locked and encrypted bootloader. The manufacturer promptly announced work on a tool to unlock the bootloader, the use of which will void the warranty and preclude use of DRM content purchased via services such as Google Videos. In a comparison with the original Transformer by the Android Police blog, the Prime was preferred. Two \\"minor\\" downsides were quoted: the speakers and the loss of a USB port. Hasbro lawsuit On 22 December 2011, toy maker Hasbro filed a lawsuit against Asus for trademark violation. Hasbro requested that Asus change the name of the Prime, claiming that the name \\"Transformer Prime\\" is using its Transformers franchise to sell tablets. Failing the name change, they are requesting that Asus not be allowed to release the Prime, and that they pay punitive damages. Asus said that the Prime's rollout would not be affected.http://www.mobileinquirer.com/2011/hasbro-sues-asus-transformer- prime-laptop-in-disguise/ However, a US judge denied Hasbro's request to block sales late May 2012, citing that \\"the tablets actually do transform\\". GPS and WiFi problems On 30 December 2011, news started to emerge that hardware problems exist in the Transformer Prime with its GPS and WiFi ability. It was suggested in user forums that the problem is a result of the spun aluminium back panel effectively blocking GPS signals, poorly contacting Pogo pin connectors causing further signal loss, and in at least some units, faulty printed circuit boards. The former issue was later corroborated by Asus themselves in a response letter discussing the issue. Asus responded by saying \\"The ASUS Transformer Prime is made from a metallic unibody design, so the material may affect the performance of the GPS when receiving signals from satellites\\" they went on to say \\"this product is not a professional GPS device\\". Most notably, they then proceeded to remove the GPS ability from the official list of Transformer Prime specs on their US website. ASUS now offers a free GPS dongle shipped to all customers who purchased the Transformer Prime, saying it \\"may help improve signal reception and optimize the user experience\\" available until 31 July 2012 (PST). Third generation model At CES 2012, the manufacturer announced the successor to the Transformer Prime, the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity (previously known as the TF700T), less than a month after the original product launch, to launch Q2 2012. This new model includes a Tegra 3 T33 processor clocked at 1.6 GHz (as opposed to the Prime's T30), and an upgraded 1,920√ó1,200-pixel-resolution screen, more than doubling the resolution of the prior model. The display was upgraded to a Super IPS+ panel for ultra bright outdoor readability with 178¬∞ wide viewing angles. In response to the signal problems, it includes a new back-panel design with the upper part made of plastic to enhance Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS performance. The front camera was boosted from 1.2 megapixels to 2 megapixels. It has improved graphics performance with a 12-core GPU.

Here, V=iR, according to Ohm's Law. In the theory of electrical networks, a dependent source is a voltage source or a current source whose value depends on a voltage or current elsewhere in the network.I. D. Mayergoyz, Wes Lawson Basic electric circuit theory: a one-semester text Gulf Professional Publishing, 1996 , Chapter 8 \\"Dependent sources and operational amplifiers\\" Dependent sources are useful, for example, in modelling the behavior of amplifiers. A bipolar junction transistor can be modelled as a dependent current source whose magnitude depends on the magnitude of the current fed into its controlling base terminal. An operational amplifier can be described as a voltage source dependent on the differential input voltage between its input terminals. Practical circuit elements have properties such as finite power capacity, voltage, current, or frequency limits that mean an ideal source is only an approximate model. Accurate modelling of practical devices requires using several idealized elements in combination. Classification Dependent sources can be classified as follows: * Voltage-controlled voltage source: The source delivers the voltage as per the voltage of the dependent element. V={f_a}({v_x}) * Voltage-controlled current source: The source delivers the current as per the voltage of the dependent element. I={f_b}({v_x}) * Current-controlled current source: The source delivers the current as per the current of the dependent element. I={f_c}({i_x}) * Current- controlled voltage source: The source delivers the voltage as per the current of the dependent element. V={f_d}({i_x}) Dependent sources are not necessarily linear. For example, MOSFET switches can be modeled as a voltage-controlled current source when V_{\\\\rm DS}>V_{\\\\rm GS}-V_T and V_{\\\\rm GS}>V_T. However, the relationship between the current flowing through it and V_{\\\\rm DS} is approximately: :I_{\\\\rm D} = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_n C_{\\\\rm ox}}{2}\\\\frac{W}{L}(V_{\\\\rm GS}-V_{\\\\rm th})^2 \\\\left(1+\\\\lambda (V_{\\\\rm DS}-V_{\\\\rm DSsat})\\\\right). In this case, the current is not linear to V_{\\\\rm DS}, but rather approximately proportional to the square of V_{\\\\rm DS}-V_T. As for the case of linear dependent sources, the proportionality constant between dependent and independent variables is dimensionless if they are both currents (or both voltages). A voltage controlled by a current has a proportionality factor expressed in units of resistance (ohms), and this constant is sometimes called \\"transresistance\\". A current controlled by a voltage has the units of conductance (siemens), and is called \\"transconductance\\". Transconductance is a commonly used specification for measuring the performance of field effect transistors and vacuum tubes.

History  Benjamin Franklin Hunt founded the Egerl√§nder Porzellanfabrik Elbogen, G.m.b.H. on 15 June 1907 in Louƒçky in Nov√© Sedlo after receiving written approval for the reconstruction of a porcelain factory at the site of the previous brick plant. Production of porcelain is traditional in this area because there are abundant resources of kaolin, loam and other raw materials. Hence, some people of great influence were interested in building a porcelain industry in the country which would be competitive with leading European producers. First porcelain factory building When Benjamin Hunt and Eleanor Hunt became the directors, they had already cooperated with the owner of Loket‚Äôs company Austria, Karl Shpek. Reconstruction work started in 1904-1905\\\\. But very soon the company went bankrupt and the reconstruction was stopped. On 8 December 1909, doctor Yuliy Geller bought the unfinished building of the porcelain factory. On 21 July 1910, Benjamin Hunt and Karl Shpek got a concession for porcelain production from the beginning of 1912, and on 25 September 1911 the firm was registered under the name of Porzellan fabrik Rudolf K√§mpf GmbH, Gr√ºnlas. In December, the plant was registered again under the name of Rudolf K√§mpf GmbH, Fabrikation und Vertrieb von Porzellanwaren und der dazu geh√∂rigen Nebenprodukte, in Gr√ºnlas. The image of a crown with letters RGK below was chosen as the logotype. Rudolf K√§mpf, a skilled businessman, developed the company successfully. On 19 March 1918 he died, and his son Huns Kampf succeeded him as head of the company. After World War II, the factory changed greatly. With the coming of the new government, the company was nationalized and became a part of Slavkovsky porcelain group, and in 1958 part of the Karlovarsky porcelain concern, which was ruled by the government. In November 1992, the factory changed ownership to Leander 1946 s.r.o. company, and from this time it was named Leander. Leander became one of the most important producers of art porcelain in Europe. In 2006, the Leander company was sold to CS Investment Czech holding. The new owners returned the name of the founder to the factory and today it is called Rudolf K√§mpf and produces handmade porcelain under 3 trademarks: * Rudolf K√§mpf: premium-class porcelain * Leander: mass-market porcelain * Leander HoReCa: porcelain for hotels, restaurants and the service industry  Rudolf K√§mpf today  Rudolf K√§mpf is producing porcelain.

It is found in shallow parts of the northwest Atlantic and also in the North Sea of Scotland coastline and west coast of the Adriatic Sea by a remote area in the Marche region in central Italy, living in the seabed, where it digs its burrows on a very slow revolving movement for years through soft sand and mud always to a max depth of 8ft but always below at the lowest tide.Cyrtopleura costata Smithsonian Marine Station. Retrieved 2011-11-30. Description Cyrtopleura costata has a pair of brittle, asymmetric white valves and can grow to about in length. The anterior end is elongated and has a rounded point which is used for digging through the substrate. The posterior end is truncated and rounded and near the beak has an apophysis, a wing-like flange, which helps provide an attachment for the foot muscles. On the anterior side of the beak, the margin is smooth and bent slightly upwards. The whole valve has finely sculptured radial ribs which intercept with a series of concentric growth rings parallel with the margin. In the living animal, the valves are covered by the periostracum, a thin grey protective layer of protein which is part of the shell. This layer has usually been stripped away by sand and surf by the time that the empty shells are washed up on the beach, and the valves are usually found singly, because the muscles that hold them together are weak. Internally, the live mollusc has a powerful muscular foot and a pair of long, fused siphons. These siphons are unable to retract back into the shell and as a result, the two valves permanently gape apart.Angel Wings: Look for the ‚ÄúSpoon‚Äù Retrieved 2011-11-30. Distribution Cyrtopleura costata is found in shallow seas in the north east Atlantic Ocean between Cape Cod and the Gulf of Mexico. It is also found in the West Indies, Central America and as far south as Brazil. It is commonest in the intertidal zone and just below low water mark. Biology Cyrtopleura costata lives beneath the surface of the sea bed. It is able to bore through sand, mud, wood, clay and even soft rock using a twisting motion of its pointed, anterior end assisted by jets of water ejected from the mantle cavity. It is a filter feeder. The siphons extend to the surface of the substrate and water is drawn in through one and expelled through the other with microalgae and zooplankton being filtered out as the water passes through the gills. Respiration takes place at the same time. Cilia then waft the food particles to the mouth. Spawning usually takes place in summer. Gametes are passed out of the exhalent siphon and fertilisation takes place externally. After hatching, eggs develop into veliger larvae which are planktonic. After 16 to 21 days these undergo metamorphosis into a pediveliger stage and settle out onto a soft substrate such as sand. There they become juveniles and start burrowing. Uses Cyrtopleura costata is used as food in Cuba and Puerto Rico. It is a fast- growing species, and it has been investigated for possible use in commercial aquaculture. Under optimal conditions it was found that the larvae were ready to undergo metamorphosis after 12 days, and settlement could be triggered by use of a dilute solution of epinephrine. The clams could reach a marketable size of within 6 months.

Where traditional diplomacy focuses on governments communicating with one another, public diplomacy seeks to engage foreign citizens and publics in order to change opinions and perceptions. Public diplomacy may present a point of view that differs than that of the targeted population's home government. In such cases, critics argue that public diplomacy is a new word for influence operations and/or propaganda.  Cultural diplomacy  The U.S. Department of State defines cultural diplomacy as the \\"linchpin of public diplomacy; for it is in cultural activities that a nation's idea of itself is best represented.\\" Further, cultural diplomacy seeks to demonstrate national values which might be shared with foreign audiences. The Islamic Republic of Iran relies on its cultural heritage and exchanges as a basis for its public diplomacy campaign.

Music diplomacy  Music diplomacy is one aspect of cultural diplomacy that seeks to engage foreign publics through musical performances. The Tehran Symphony Orchestra is often sponsored by the Iranian government in musical exchanges throughout the world. In its efforts to approach European audiences, Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs provided free tickets to invited dignitaries and guests. Describing the 2010 European tour, the New York Times referenced overt propaganda through performances of the \\"Peace and Friendship Symphony\\", a piece written to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. Much of the tour was met with criticism by demonstrations and protests. Michael Kimmelman of the New York Times declared the performance a tragedy, failing to meet the efforts of proper cultural exchange and public diplomacy.

Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting  The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting is the state-run broadcast communications organization. The IRIB contributes to the Islamic Republic's cultural diplomacy by providing Iranian focused radio, satellite-television, and web based broadcasts presented in a number of languages.  Al Alam  Al Alam is the IRIB's 24-hour Arabic satellite channel, targeting over 300 million Arabic speakers worldwide. Launched in early 2003, the network initially served as a platform of opposition to both the Iraq led Ba'ath Party and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. The BBC early reported that Al Alam shared programming similarities to Qatar-based Al Jazeera, only with an Iranian message. name=alalam> Such reporting has allowed Al Alam to promote a pan-Muslim image in order to downplay the Shia-Sunni sectarian conflict during the height of Operation Iraqi Freedom. name=alalam>  Hispan TV  HispanTV is the IRIB's newest satellite network venture, targeting Spanish speaking populations of the Americas. First offering its news and analysis via the internet, HispanTV is scheduled to expand its satellite broadcasts in early 2012. Hispan TV is intending to counter what Ali Mohaqqeq, General-Secretary of the Iranian Embassy in Brazil, says is a western \\"monopoly of news about Iran and the Middle East in Latin America.\\" = Goals = The primary goal of Hispan TV is to provide a complete platform of multimedia service to the Spanish speaking peoples of Latin America, offering an opportunity for cultural exchange through television and web broadcasts. Further goals include: * To produce audio-visual and film materials that offer the cultural reality of Iran, the Middle East, and the Spanish speaking Americas to viewers * To reflect the reality of Spanish speaking countries within its social construct, presented in its original context * To interpret day-to-day social realities via television and web * To develop, provide, and support audio-visual equipment for broadcast, granting effective feedback * To broadcast informative programs that include art, culture, economics, education, entertainment, food, health, politics, science, society issues, sports, technology, and other areas * To permanently transform Hispan TV as a bridge of friendship and understanding between the peoples of Iran, the Middle East, and Latin America, which will allow the development of shared principles of friendship, fraternity, brotherhood, solidarity, and justice,  iFilm  Like Al Alam, iFilm is an Arabic speaking satellite network that targets much of Southwest Asia.

A member of the object-oriented philosophy movement, Morton's work explores the intersection of object- oriented thought and ecological studies. Morton's use of the term 'hyperobjects' was inspired by Bj√∂rk's 1996 single 'Hyperballad' although the term 'Hyper-objects' (denoting n-dimensional non-local entities) has also been used in computer science since 1967. Morton uses the term to explain objects so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend localization, such as climate change and styrofoam. His recent book Humankind: Solidarity with Non-Human People explores the separation between humans and non-humans and from an object-oriented ontological perspective, arguing that humans need to radically rethink the way in which they conceive of, and relate to, non-human animals and nature as a whole, going on to explore the political implications of such a change. Morton has also written extensively about the literature of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley, Romanticism, diet studies, and ecotheory. Personal Morton received a B.A. and D.Phil. in English from Magdalen College, Oxford. His doctoral dissertation, \\"Re-Imagining the Body: Shelley and the Languages of Diet,\\" studied the representation of diet, temperance, and consumption in the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. According to Morton, the decision to study English literature, as opposed to more academically fashionable classics, stemmed from a desire to engage with modes of thought evolving internationally \\"including all kinds of continental philosophy that just wasn't happening much in England at the time, what with the war against 'theory' and all.\\" Before obtaining a professorship at Rice University, in 2012, Morton previously taught at the University of California, Davis, New York University and the University of Colorado, Boulder. Theoretical works Morton's theoretical writings espouse an eclectic approach to scholarship. His subjects include the poetry and literature of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley, the cultural significance and context of food, ecology and environmentalism, and object-oriented ontology (OOO). Shelley scholarship In 1995, Morton published Shelley and the Revolution in Taste: The Body and the Natural World, an extension of the ideas presented in his doctoral dissertation. Investigating how food came to signify ideological outlook in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Morton's book is an attempt at 'green' cultural criticism, whereby bodies and the social or environmental conditions in which they appear are shown to be interrelated. Employing a 'prescriptive' analysis of various Romantic texts, especially Percy Bysshe Shelley's A Vindication of Natural Diet (1813), Morton argues that the figurative rhetorical elements of these texts should be read not simply as clever language play, but as commands to establish consumptive practices that challenge ideological configurations of how the body relates to normativity. For Morton, authoritarian power dynamics, commodity flows, industrial logic, and the distinction between the domains of nature and culture are inhered in the 'discourses of diet' articulated by the Shelleys. In turn, Shelleyan prose regarding forms of consumption, particularly vegetarianism, is read as a call for social reform and figurative discussions of intemperance and intoxication as warnings against tyranny. Additionally, Morton has edited two critical volumes on the Shelleyan corpus. In 2002, he published a compilation of critical and historical reflections on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein entitled Mary Shelley's Frankenstein: A Routledge Study Guide and Sourcebook. Then, in 2006, Morton edited The Cambridge Companion to Shelley, an interdisciplinary overview of Percy Bysshe Shelley's themes, language, narrative structure, literary philosophy, and political views. Diet studies From 2000 to 2004, Morton published three works dealing with the intersection of food and cultural studies. In the first of these to be published, The Poetics of Spice: Romantic Consumerism and the Exotic (2000), Morton unpacked the evolution of European consumer culture through an analysis of the figurative use of spice in Romantic literature. Viewing spice as a cultural artifact that functioned \\"as discourse, not object, naively transparent to itself\\" during the Romantic period, he elucidates two general characteristics of the poetics of spice: materiality and transumption. The 'materiality' of spice connects its symbolic and social roles with its capacity for desire production. Morton cites the \\"trade winds topos\\" (perfumed breeze believed to waft from exotic lands in which spices are domestic) in Milton's Paradise Lost as an example, concluding that Milton prefigures the symbolic use of spice in later works by presenting Satan's journey from Hell to Chaos as a parallel to the travels of spice traders. In contrast, 'transumption', following Harold Bloom's deployment of the rhetorical concept, entails the use of a metasignifier that \\"serves as a figure for poetic language itself.\\" According to Morton, the works of John Dryden exemplify transumption, revealing \\"a novel kind of capitalist poetics, relying on the representation of the spice trade...Spice is not a balm, but an object of trade, a trope to be carried across boundaries, standing in for money: a metaphor about metaphor.\\" Carrying this idea forward to the Romantic era, Morton critiques the manner in which spice became a metaphor for exotic desire that, subsequently, encapsulated the self-reflexivity of modern processes of commodification. Later, Morton edited Radical Food: The Culture and Politics of Eating and Drinking, 1790-1820 (2000), a three-volume compendium of eighteenth century texts examining the literary, sociocultural, and political history of food, including works on intoxication, cannibalism, and slavery. He also edited Cultures of Taste/Theories of Appetite: Eating Romanticism (2004), a collection of essays that problematizes the use of taste and appetite as Romantic metaphors for bounded territories and subjectivities, while empirically interrogating the organization of Romantic cultural and economic structures around competing logics of consumption. Ecological theory Since 2009, Morton has engaged in a sustained project of ecological critique, primarily enunciated in two works, Ecology Without Nature (2009) and The Ecological Thought (2010), through which he problematizes environmental theory from the standpoint of ecological entanglement. In Ecology Without Nature, Morton proposes that an ecological criticism must be divested of the bifurcation of nature and civilization, or the idea that nature exists as something that sustains civilization, but exists outside of society's walls. As Morton states: Viewing \\"nature,\\" in the putative sense, as an arbitrary textual signifier, Morton theorizes artistic representations of the environment as sites for opening ideas of nature to new possibilities. Seeking an aesthetic mode that can account for the differential, paradoxical, and nonidentificational character of the environment, he proposes a materialist method of textual analysis called 'ambient poetics', in which artistic texts of all kinds are considered in terms of how they manage the space in which they appear, thereby attuning the sensibilities of their audience to forms of natural representation that contravene the ideological coding of nature as a transcendent principle. Historicizing this form of poetics permits the politicization of environmental art and its 'ecomimesis', or authenticating evocation of the author's environment, such that the experience of its phenomena becomes present for and shared with the audience. Art is also an important theme in The Ecological Thought, a \\"prequel\\" to Ecology Without Nature, in which Morton proposes the concept of 'dark ecology' as a means of expressing the \\"irony, ugliness, and horror\\" of ecology. From the vantage point of dark ecology, there exists no neutral theoretical ground on which to articulate ecological claims. Instead, all beings always are already implicated within the ecological, necessitating an acknowledgement of coexistential difference for coping with ecological catastrophe that, according to Morton, \\"has already occurred.\\" Closely related to dark ecology is Morton's concept of the 'mesh'. Defining the ecological thought as \\"the thinking of interconnectedness,\\" Morton thus uses 'mesh' to refer to the interconnectedness of all living and non-living things, consisting of \\"infinite connections and infinitesimal differences.\\" He explains: The mesh has no central position that privileges any one form of being over others, and thereby erases definitive interior and exterior boundaries of beings. Emphasizing the interdependence of beings, the ecological thought \\"permits no distance,\\" such that all beings are said to relate to each other in a totalizing open system, negatively and differentially, rendering ambiguous those entities with which we presume familiarity. Morton calls these ambiguously inscribed beings 'strange strangers', or beings unable to be completely comprehended and labeled. Within the mesh, even the strangeness of strange strangers relating coexistentially is strange, meaning that the more we know about an entity, the stranger it becomes. Intimacy, then, becomes threatening because it veils the mesh beneath the illusion of familiarity. Object-oriented ontology Morton became involved with object-oriented ontology after his ecological writings were favorably compared with the movement's ideas. One way that his work can be distinguished from other variants of object-oriented thought is by its focus on the causal dimension of object relations. Against traditional causal philosophies, Morton argues that causality is an aesthetic dimension of relations between objects, wherein sensory experience does not indicate direct access to reality, but rather an uncanny interruption of the false ontic equilibrium of an interobjective system. Causation, in this view, is held to be illusion-like or \\"magical,\\" forming the core of what Morton terms \\"realist magic.\\" =Hyperobjects= In The Ecological Thought, Morton employed the term hyperobjects to describe objects that are so massively distributed in time and space as to transcend spatiotemporal specificity, such as global warming, styrofoam, and radioactive plutonium. He has subsequently enumerated five characteristics of hyperobjects: # Viscous: Hyperobjects adhere to any other object they touch, no matter how hard an object tries to resist. In this way, hyperobjects overrule ironic distance, meaning that the more an object tries to resist a hyperobject, the more glued to the hyperobject it becomes. # Molten: Hyperobjects are so massive that they refute the idea that spacetime is fixed, concrete, and consistent. # Nonlocal: Hyperobjects are massively distributed in time and space to the extent that their totality cannot be realized in any particular local manifestation. For example, global warming is a hyperobject which impacts meteorological conditions, such as tornado formation. According to Morton, though, entities don't feel global warming, but instead experience tornadoes as they cause damage in specific places. Thus, nonlocality describes the manner in which a hyperobject becomes more substantial than the local manifestations it produces. # Phased: Hyperobjects occupy a higher-dimensional space than other entities can normally perceive. Thus, hyperobjects appear to come and go in three-dimensional space, but would appear differently if an observer could have a higher multidimensional view. # Interobjective: Hyperobjects are formed by relations between more than one object. Consequently, entities are only able to perceive the imprint, or \\"footprint,\\" of a hyperobject upon other objects, revealed as information. For example, global warming is formed by interactions between the sun, fossil fuels, and carbon dioxide, among other objects. Yet global warming is made apparent through emissions levels, temperature changes, and ocean levels, making it seem as if global warming is a product of scientific models, rather than an object that predates its own measurement. According to Morton, hyperobjects not only become visible during an age of ecological crisis, but alert humans to the ecological dilemmas defining the age in which they live. Additionally, the existential capacity of hyperobjects to outlast a turn toward less materialistic cultural values, coupled with the threat many such objects pose toward organic matter (what Morton calls a \\"demonic inversion of the sacred substances of religion\\"), gives them a potential spiritual quality, in which their treatment by future societies may become indistinguishable from reverential care. Although the concept of hyperobjects has been widely adopted by artists, literary critics, and some philosophers, it is not without its critics. Ecocritic Ursule Heise, for example, notes that in Morton's definition, everything can be considered a hyperobject, which seems to make the concept somewhat meaningless, not to mention seemingly impossible to define clearly. As a result, Heise argues that Morton makes \\"so many self- cancelling claims about hyperobjects that coherent argument vanishes like the octopi that disappear in several chapters in their clouds of ink, Morton's favorite metaphor for the withdrawal of objects from the grasp of human knowledge.\\" Bibliography *1994.

Both names are acceptable as a 'Fibonacci crystal' denotes a quasicrystal and a 'Fibonacci' quasicrystal is a specific type of quasicrystal. Fibonacci 'chains' or 'lattices' are closely related terms, depending on the dimension of the model.Searching database of physical papers reveals that 'Fibonacci chain' is the most frequently used; for instance more than 150 such items are found in Arxiv and just a few dozen other appelations. While it is used mostly as a theoretical construct, physical models are implemented in order to verify the concept empirically. Most of its applications pertain to various areas of solid state physics. Two-dimensional aperiodic tiling based on the Fibonacci word The mathematical properties of the Fibonacci word and related topics are well researched and readily applied in such studies. The elements of a Fibonacci crystal structure are arranged in one or more spatial dimensions according to the sequence given by the Fibonacci word. The Fourier transform of such arrangements consists of discrete values, which is the defining property for crystals. In an algebraic form, the sequence is expressed via a matrix whose eigenvalues are Pisot- Vijayaraghavan numbers (PV numbers). This feature guarantees that its Fourier transform is discrete. Material waves with appropriate length interfere constructively when interacting with a Fibonacci-structured physical system. For instance, when submitted to X-rays, a Fibonacci quasicrystal produces Bragg peaks. Other features describing media behaviour such as damping, transmitivity, etc. can be evidenced on Fibonacci models. Recently, Felix and Pereira investigated the thermal transport by phonons in periodic and quasiperiodic superlattices of graphene-hBN according to the Fibonacci sequence. They reported that the contribution of coherent thermal transport (phonons like-wave) was suppressed as quasiperiodicity increased. The Fibonacci-based constructions are an obvious example of quasicrystals which, in contrast to many well-known and typical examples of quasicrystals, do not possess a 'forbidden symmetry'. Their diffraction pattern is of a square type with the intensities arranged in a fractal pattern.

He died later that afternoon.Staffordshire Advertiser, Saturday 18 August 1838, a very detailed account.Buckinghamshire Herald, Saturday 11 August 1838.Worcester Chronicle, Thursday 16 August 1838. Historical background The first part of the London to Birmingham Railway opened between Euston Station and Hemel Hempstead on 20 July 1837, and then on to Bletchley in time for Queen Victoria's coronation on 28 June 1838. The whole railway was officially fully opened on 17 September 1838. Description of the accident Thomas Port was employed as a guard by the London and Birmingham Railway. At that time train operation was still largely based upon British stagecoach practice and Port‚Äôs normal travelling location aboard the train was in an outside seat at roof level. It was part of his duty to undertake ticket checks to make sure second class passengers were not sitting in first class carriages. This task required that once the train was underway he would climb down to move along the step boards on the outside of the carriages so he could check the tickets through the door windows. On the day of his death, 7 August 1838, the train had left Euston Station at 5pm. About 10 miles (16 km) from Euston and 1¬º miles (2 km) from Harrow the train was travelling at full speed, about 30 mph (50 km/h). As Port stepped from one carriage to the next he slipped and fell under the train. His legs were run over. One of the other guards saw the injured Port lying on the tracks and called to the driver to stop the train. Emergency first aid was given by two doctors who were travelling on the train and then Port was put aboard and taken to Harrow. Here the doctors fully amputated his legs but Port died from a loss of blood within 3 hours of the accident. Thomas Port \\"left a father, a mother, several brothers and sisters, and a wife and two children to lament his loss.\\"Staffordshire Advertiser, Saturday 18 August 1838.

The aim of the school was to give the young Holocaust survivors an education, a new will to live and to prepare themselves for a possible life in Israel. The school trained about 45 to 60 students, but was slowly closed after the establishment of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. Most of the students emigrated to Israel and were recruited to the new established Israel Defense Forces. Although the school only existed for ten months, it nevertheless represents an important aspect of the post-war history of Hesse and a manifestation of the re-emergence and establishment of Jewish life in post-war Germany. School The school was named after the archaeological site of Masada near the Dead Sea, a fee-standing cliff with a plateau fortified in antiquity. According to Josephus, the Siege of Masada took place there at the end of the First Jewish-Roman War. The long siege by the troops of the Roman Empire led to the mass suicide of the Sicarii rebels and their families of the Masada fortress, who preferred to die rather than go into slavery. The Masada school was a Vocational School affiliated with the Betar movement, a right-leaning, Revisionist Zionist youth movement which was founded in 1923 with the aim to establish a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan.Ilana Michaeli, Irmgard Kl√∂nne (Hg.): Gut-Winkel - Die sch√ºtzende Insel. Hachschara 1933-1941. (Deutsch-Israelische Bibliothek, Bd. 3, Berlin 2007, p. 280, in German. The name Betar refers to both the last Jewish fort to fall in the Bar Kokhba revolt (136 AD) and to the Hebrew acronym of the words \\"Brit Yosef Trumpeldor\\", \\"Covenant of Joseph Trumpeldor\\". The school was founded and supervised by Samuel Milek Batalion. This was quite unusual, because almost all the schools for Displaced Persons (DPs) known after the war were located in the DP camps and were created and supported by ORT. In this context it was quite unusual that a singular person established and ran a school by himself in cooperation with the Betar organization. In 1946, Samuel Batalion met Moshe Mordchelewitz in Eschwege at a Betar meeting. Moshe was also very active in the Betar movement. On Moshe's advice, Batalion presented his idea to open a vocational school to the Betar head office in Munich. They approved it, and Battalion received permission to transfer Moshe to Darmstadt to be the madrich, the youth leader, in the new school. The school was partially financed by the Betar Central Committee in Munich and the local American Military Government. Furthermore, the regional German Government and the City of Darmstadt also supported the establishment of the school. Some of the teachers were locally recruited with the help of the local school authorities. JOINT also supported some of the students. Samuel Batalion was very committed to the project. He established locations and organised the lodgings and provisions, teaching staff, financing and equipping of the school. The school was closed several months after the establishment of the State of Israel, since most of the students had been emigrated to Israel. Ludwig Bergstr√§sser, a German politician and historian who was also present at the inauguration, mentioned the forthcoming closing of the school in his diary on June 18, 1948.Befreiung, Besatzung, Neubeginn - Tagebuch des Darmst√§dter Regierungspr√§sidenten 1945-1948, M√ºnchen, 1987, p.313, in German. Buildings Main-Neckar train station in Darmstadt The regional German Government and the City of Darmstadt provided the facility of the school and the living quarters of the students nearby. The school was located within the former building of the Main-Neckar train station, at Steubenplatz in the centre of Darmstadt. This was in contrast to most of the Jewish educational establishments in post-war Germany, which were located within the DP camps. The train station was served by trains until the opening of the main train station in Darmstadt in 1912. From 1937, the building of the old Rhein-Neckar train station housed from the Nazi's welfare organization of the district Hesse-Nassau and was then named the \\"Jacob-Sprenger house\\" after the local official.\\"Das neue Heim der RGB-Bauamtsleitung Jakob-Sprenger Haus, in: Darmstaedter Tageblatt from December 1, 1937 and \\"Jakob-Sprenger-Haus\\" in: Hessische Landeszeitung from December 1, 1937 For living quarters, the school was granted a building in the hospital complex not far away from the school at Steubenplatz. The students lived in one of these buildings and walked approximately 20 minutes to the school. The address given for the living quarters is Bismarckstr. 59 and Grafenstr. 9. The school facilities in the former Main-Neckar train station building consisted of classrooms, workshops offices and kitchen facilities. The students themselves renovated the run-down building. The equipment in the school and the boarding accommodation was considered rudimentary. Inauguration On 8 September 1947, the Jewish vocational school Masada, in Darmstadt, started their first activities.\\"Erste j√ºdische Fachschule\\", in: Darmst√§dter Echo from September 13, 1947 The official opening ceremony of the school was on 5 December. At this ceremony, Colonel Rose, district chief of the American Military Authorities, officially opened the school. Guests at the ceremony included other members of the military authorities, members of Hesse's Regional Parliament, the Head of the Regional Parliament, as well as members of the Darmstadt city council and the city's Jewish community and representatives of the Central Committee of Betar from Munich. Aron Propes, the leader of the Jewish youth organization Betar in America, also attended the inauguration and gave a speech at the celebration after the opening ceremony. In addition, German and American authorities and representatives of other institutions sent their greetings to the opening ceremony.\\"Erste J√ºdische Berufsfachschule\\", in: Darmst√§dter Echo from December 9, 1947 Curriculum In order to prepare them for a new life in Israel, the students were trained to become locksmiths, metal workers, carpenters and other tradesmen. In this purpose, the curriculum included courses in technical calculation, measurement and control technology and electrical installation. The courses offered ranged from electrical engineering to machine-lathing, mechanical engineering and building-fitting to wood-working. In addition, they were taught Hebrew, Jewish philosophy, physical fitness and the basics of Betar and Zionist ideology, for which books in Hebrew were supplied by Betar Munich. Lessons were held for ten hours a day. Students The school taught about 45 to 60 Holocaust survivors from various DP camps in the American Zone, such as the DP Camps in Babenhausen, Dieburg, Rochelle Eschenstruth, Gabersee in Wasserburg and Weilheim. Each one had managed to survive the holocaust and was now determined to prepare themselves for a future existence in Israel. Most of them came from Poland, with a significant number also coming from Romania. The Romanians immigrated to Germany quite late, and did not live in the DP camps but instead came directly to the Masada school. Other students originated in countries like Lithuania, Hungary and Czechoslovakia and spoke several languages. The most common languages were Yiddish and German, followed by Polish and Romanian. Some spoke Hungarian, Russian and Hebrew. Almost all students expressed the wish to emigrate to Palestine. According to the records, 19 students left for Palestine on 3 July 1948. Only a few stated that they wanted to emigrate to the USA or to stay in Germany. Important figures Samuel Milek Batalion Samuel Batalion was the founder and director of the Masada School. Samuel Milek Batalion was born 22 September 1918 in Stryj, the son of Natan Batalion-Lebersfeld and Fanny Hennenfeld. He graduated high-school in 1937, at which time he also joined Betar. He registered to study law at the University of Lemberg (Lvov), but fled to Russia towards the end of 1939, soon after reading Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf\\". He walked all the way to Perm where he remained for several years. In Perm, he worked as a plumber and later became a station leader of a sovkhoz. He was arrested twice, once because he was accused of being a Zionist. He was released after agreeing to spy on his workers and friends for the NKWD, but after his release, he arranged false papers which identified him as a professional boxer. To avoid his first match, he flew to Saratov. There, with the help of a common acquaintance, he was reunited with his sister Helen. He also met Sophie Osser, whom he married on 8 May 1945. They left Saratov a few months later to travel, via Poland, into Germany. At the end of 1945, disguised as armed Russian soldiers, Batalion and a group of friends crossed over to West Berlin in an officer's car claiming to be on a secret night-time mission. He travelled to Hannover and, from there, on to the DP camp in Eschwege. There he became an UNRRA officer and assisted in organizing several new DP camps. He lived with his wife in Hessisch Lichtenau until October 1946. There he began to plan the establishment of the school and, in May 1947, he was appointed as director of the Jewish Vocational School Darmstadt, a position he held until it closed in 1948. Battalion became an independent tradesman. The couple had two children, Lea Dror-Batalion and Nathan Batalion. The family moved to Frankfurt at the end of 1950. Samuel Batalion died in 2000 in Frankfurt. Moshe Mordchelewitz Moshe Mordchelewitz was the Madrich of the school and taught the students Hebrew, Jewish philosophy, physical fitness and the basics of Betar and Zionist ideology. Moshe Mordchelewitz was born 18 February 1920 in Kovno (Kaunas), Lithuania. His parents were Sarah Brode and Eisig Mordchelewitz. Moshe had already joined the Betar movement in 1937 upon graduation from high school. In 1939 he was recruited into the Lithuanian army, which was promptly disbanded in 1940 following the Russian invasion. After the Germans occupied Lithuania on June 22, 1941, they created ghettos for the Jews. Moshe's two brothers, Yaakov and Sissel, were shot in the Kovno Ghetto in 1943, and only Moshe was able to escape. Moshe was interred as a forced labourer in Russia until 1945, whereupon he went to Poland in 1946 and then travelled on to Germany. Moshe was very active in the Betar movement and met Samuel Battalion at a Betar conference. He became the Madrich of the Masada school in Darmstadt due to his experience working as a Madrich in Gabersee. Moshe had also led the Herzog Kibbutz in the DP camp at Hessisch Lichtenau. He arrived in Darmstadt in 1947 and lived in the Kibbutz. During the day Moshe often attended university lectures as a guest auditor and taught in the evening. Representatives of the Jewish Agency came from Palestine to Darmstadt to bring the students to Palestine. In April 1948, Moshe was the first to leave the school in order to join the Irgun, a Zionist paramilitary group in Mandate Palestine between 1931 and 1948 which is also known as Etzel, and fight in Palestine. Moshe stated that he boarded the ship \\"Teti\\" in Marseille and arrived on May 15, 1948 in Tel Aviv. He was initially recruited into an Irgun combat company. Once the State of Israel was declared, a unified Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was created. Following the incident involving the ship \\"Atalena\\", the less-than-willing Irgun was disbanded and its members, Mordchelewitz among them, were integrated into the IDF, for whom he then fought until the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. He was discharged in August 1949. He married Miriam Kalmus on November 8, 1949 and raised two daughters. After his wife died in 1980, he married Falla Minkowitz in 1981, with whom he emigrated to Canada. Moshe Mordchelewitz died in September 2011. Exhibition The opening of the exhibition in Darmstadt Lea Dror-Batalion did some intensive research about her father Samuel Milek Batalion and the Masada Vocational School in Darmstadt. The result is an exhibition about the Jewish Vocational School Masada, which was developed in cooperation with Renate Dreesen and pupils from the Heinrich-Emanuel-Merck-School in Darmstadt, and under the auspices of the University of Haifa and the Bucerius Institute for Research of Contemporary German History and Society. The exhibition was shown in 2011 in Darmstadt,Frankfurter Rundschau from January 28, 2011 at the Edith-Stein-School in Darmstadt and at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany. \\"Ausstellung √ºber die J√ºdische Berufsfachschule Masada\\" on IsraelMagazin.de on November 3, 2011, in German The exhibition is also planned for other locations in Germany and Israel.

The term given circumstances is applied to the total set of environmental and situational conditions which influence the actions that a character in a drama undertakes. Although a character may make such choices unconsciously, the actor playing the character is aware of such conditions on a conscious level to help him or her deepen his or her understanding of the motivation behind the character's actions. Given circumstances include conditions of the character's world (e.g. specifics of time and place: in Hamlet for instance, being in Elsinore at a specific time in history is a given circumstance), elements from the history of the character's environment (e.g. Hamlet: the death of the old King Hamlet preceding the play's plot is a given circumstance), and elements from the character's personal situation (e.g. Hamlet: the character Hamlet is a crown prince).

Whilst the actual items of clothing can vary, but the general style of clothing remains the same. The main idea is that the dresses should be full of frills and ruffles and be multilayered. In one interpretation, designed for a play that was set in the 1890s, the cancan dresses were \\"in different colours with lots of ruffles and frills on their petticoats and pantalette style underwear...and dark pantyhose or fishnet stockings with ruffled garters\\". The cancan outfit can also be adorned with some or all of the following accessories: ankle boots, hats, gloves, capes, shawls, wraps, boas, jewelry and feathers. Traditionally, women commonly wore split knickers in their outfit. In Celebrities' Most Wanted, a dress \\"not unlike a can-can dancer's dress\\" was described as \\"short and bustled in the front, flowing into a long bustled train of messy black and white fabric in the back\\" Contemporary versions of the cancan dress have appeared in various media. For example, in the number \\"Zidler's Rap (The Can-Can)\\" in the film Moulin Rouge, director Baz Luhrmann redesigned the can-can dresses into multi-coloured flower patterns and gave each dancer individual \\"personas\\", to make the otherwise boring dresses sexually tantalizing to modern day audiences.

Further research was done by Maurice Campbell in 1951 when he reported on the penis being buried beneath subcutaneous fat of the scrotum, perineum, hypogastrium, and thigh. A buried penis can lead to obstruction of urinary stream, poor hygiene, soft tissue infection, phimosis, and inhibition of normal sexual function. Buried penis is different than micropenis, which is an abnormally small, normally structured penis with a stretched penile length of less than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean for age or stage of sexual development of the patient.  Causes   Congenital  Congenital causes can include the maldevelopment of the penile shaft with a lack of attachments of the shaft skin to the penile shaft. While rare, it can include an abnormally large pubic fat pad and firm tissue that pulls the penis inward.  Acquired  = Obesity = While not every obese male has the buried penis condition, 87% of men that received surgical treatment for buried penis were reported to be obese. Significant overlying abdominal fat can also create an environment that encourages bacterial and fungal growth. Obesity can also increase the likelihood of the development of type II diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by increase susceptibility to infections, making it difficult to successfully and promptly manage the buried penis condition. Such recurring infections can also lead to scar contracture, which can cause the prepubic skin to shift over the shaft and glans, thus invaginating the shaft's skin and leading to a buried penis. = Penoscrotal lymphodema = While an uncommon cause, penoscrotal lymphodema causes a deformity of the shaft and scrotum, resulting in a buried penis. = Overly aggressive circumcision = In some cases of circumcision, too much foreskin is removed or the suture line constricts, causing cicatricial scarring, which can trap the penis in the remaining foreskin or push the penis into the suprapubic area and lead to a buried penis. = Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) = BXO is a chronic inflammatory dermatological process that causes sclerosis of the glans, shaft, prepuce, or urethra. This can result in a cicatrix of the distal penis and its entrapment. = Dysgenic dartos = Dysgenic dartos is a condition characterized by a lack of dorsal support together with the hypermobility of the ventral skin and the lack of proper attachment between the dartos and the penis. This can enable the penis to \\"telescope\\" into the scrotum, thus creating a buried penis.  Treatment  Adults with a buried penis will either live with their condition or undergo weight-loss programs. However, weight-loss programs are slow and often do not \\"unbury\\" the penis; furthermore, poor hygiene from pooling of urine can lead to soft tissue infection. While the condition may resolve itself without any intervention in very young children, patients may eventually need definitive reconstructive surgery and more urgent surgery if infection is present. Surgeons who manage this condition are either reconstructive urologic surgeons or plastic surgeons. Surgical options could include the detachment of the ligaments connecting the base of the penis to the pubic bone; the performance of skin grafts to cover areas of the penis requiring additional skin; liposuction using catheters to suck out fat cells under the skin from the area around the penis; an abdominoplasty in which excess fat and skin from the region are removed; an escutheonectomy in which the pad of fat just above the pubic area is removed; or a panniculectomy in which the panniculus, excess tissue, and skin that hangs over the genitals and thighs are removed. In a video demonstrating the use of a panniculectomy in the repair of adult buried penis, Dr. Bryan Voelzke and his colleagues emphasized the need to tack the suprapubic fat pad to the periosteum of the symphysis pubis as well as the importance of not pulling down the peno-scrotal junction and peno-abdominal junction just in order to further expose the penis. King IC, Tahir A, Ramanathan C, Siddiqui H developed a modified treatment algorithm employing a single surgical technique consisting primarily of scar release and the mobilization of the skin of the penis. An article published in August 2019 by Dr. James J. Elist reported that a procedure involving the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone penile implant was successful in reversing the condition of adult acquired buried penis.

The station, which was opened in 1897 as Wettiner Stra√üe, is located on the connecting line between Dresden Hauptbahnhof and Dresden-Neustadt station. It has been proposed as the location of a new Dresden central train station several times. Train services are operated by Deutsche Bahn, St√§dtebahn Sachsen and Vogtlandbahn.  Location The Dresden Mitte station is located close to Dresden's Old Town about 500 metres west of the Dresden Zwinger on the border between the districts of Wilsdruffer Vorstadt and Friedrichstadt. In the immediate vicinity are the Internationales Congress Center Dresden, the former cigarette factory Yenidze, the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber (college of music) in the former Wettiner Gymnasium (school) and the Ostragehege, which contains the Messe Dresden (exhibition ground) and various sports facilities. The planned new venue for the Staatsoperette Dresden (Dresden State Operetta) is also located near the station on the site of the former central power plant.  History   History and construction The original railway construction in Dresden followed no master plan. Rather, each private railway company built its own station as a terminus of its long- distance operations, so that there were four different poorly-linked long- distance stations in Dresden in 1875. In addition, the many level crossings created major traffic problems. By the late 1880s, all railways to Dresden had been nationalised and it was decided to fundamentally restructure the Dresden railway node. Under the leadership of building manager Otto Klette, it was agreed that this would involve the creation of a new central train station, but for a long time a consensus could not be reached on the site. After the Elbe flood in March 1845, the inspector of surveys Karl Pressler had suggested the relocation of the Wei√üeritz near Cotta so that the former riverbed could be used for a Dresden central station. This plan was taken up and the former riverbed was used for a connection line between the Dresden railway stations, but instead of a central station, a simple station for suburban services was built in the area of Wettiner Stra√üe. The new main station (Hauptbahnhof) was instead built on the site of the former Bohemian station, due on the one hand to its proximity to Prager Stra√üe, which became the most important shopping street of Dresden in the last quarter of the 19th century, and on the other hand because it was already the busiest station in Dresden.Kai√ü/Hengst: Dresdens Eisenbahn, pp. 10f From 1891 to September 1893, the Wei√üeritz was relocated and the current Mitte station was opened provisionally for through traffic on 1 August 1896. The inauguration of Haltestelle Wettiner Stra√üe (Wettiner Stra√üe halt) took place on 1 October 1897. Following the example of many Berlin S-Bahn stations, this station received a 100-metre-long and 36 metre-wide concourse that spanned all six tracks. Tracks 1 and 4 were reserved for suburban traffic and tracks 2 and 3 for long-distance through traffic. Tracks 5 and 6 were reserved for freight; trains running to the south could reach both Dresden-Friedrichstadt and the Hauptbahnhof. The station hall was flanked by four turrets ornamented with pillars, which supported the train shed. Large arched windows adorned the long sides of the train shed.QaKai√ü/Hengst: Dresdens Eisenbahn, pp. 40ff Located at the entrance to the elevated tracks at street level were ticket counters, baggage handling facilities, waiting rooms and restaurants, as are found at Dresden-Neustadt station. The fact that a local railway station had such extensive facilities is an indication of its importance for professional and commercial activity.  Remodeling plans and demolition of the train shed The ruined station in 1945 Surviving corner pylon of the former train shed The conversion of the station into Dresden Hauptbahnhof was subsequently considered several times. In the late 1930s the Nazis planned the reconstruction of Dresden, which would have included a new central station in place of Wettiner Stra√üe station. The proposed station would have had enormous dimensions, the new station would have been 300 metres long and 200 metres wide with an oversized courtyard and spacious streets intended for rallies and marches. Nearby between Freiberger Stra√üe and Ehrlichstra√üe there would have been another area for rallies called the Reichsbahnbogen (Reichsbahn bow). With the outbreak of the Second World War, however, these plans quickly became obsolete.Kai√ü/Hengst: Dresdens Eisenbahn, pp 27f During the Bombing of Dresden in 1945 the structure of the train shed was greatly affected. However, the damage was not so severe that it would have justified the demolition of the train shed, including three corner pylons, that was completed in 1953. Just one of four pylons was preserved, because it contained the flue for the station's heating system.Kai√ü/Hengst: Dresdens Eisenbahn, pp 62f Previously, reconstruction of the station as a central station had been discussed again. The large-scale destruction of Dresden would have allowed a far-reaching reorganisation of the railway systems and so in 1946 and 1947 several plans were drawn up over a few years for a new generously dimensioned central station to replace the Wettiner Stra√üe station. This would have had 17 through platform tracks and three terminal platforms and have been 400 metres-long and 186.5 metres-wide and oriented parallel with K√∂nneritzstra√üe. An entrance building would have been built on the eastern side towards the centre of the old town. In successive drafts the dimensions were reduced somewhat by reducing the platform space for luggage, but the original draft was substantially maintained. A main objective of the planned restructuring of the railway node was to allow trains to run on the east‚Äìwest route between Chemnitz and G√∂rlitz without reversing in Dresden. Why these plans were not ultimately carried out, cannot be answered with certainty, however, financial problems, material shortages, labour shortages and general planning uncertainty during socio-political change are cited as possible reasons.Kai√ü/Hengst: Dresdens Eisenbahn, pp 44ff. The previous name of the station referred to the royal House of Wettin and therefore was not considered to be consistent with the socialist system. Therefore, the station was renamed Dresden-Mitte on 20 July 1946. Little changed in the following 40 years. No platform canopies remained, but the tracks and the buildings were designed for a covered station and rainwater seeped through the inadequately sealed floor and caused a gradual decline in its condition.  Reconstruction after German reunification  New pedestrian tunnel After the reunification of Germany, there were initially plans for the building of a glazed concourse on two levels with shops and offices designed by Ingenhoven Architects. This proposal failed because of a lack of funds. Minor renovations took place in 1997 and Deutsche Bahn rebuilt the station from scratch from November 2001 during the reconstruction of the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway. Trams have run since mid-2002 under the train tracks and now stop in front of the platform at the entrance in Jahnstra√üe (street). The new platforms 1 and 2 were completed in January 2003 and platforms 3 and 4 in October 2004. An additional pedestrian tunnel, which had not initially been planned, was also built at the northern end of the platform in order to improve the link with the northern Friedrichstadt. A DB Service Store was opened as the first internal space in March 2005. Further expansion was expected in 2014. The station forecourt (Bahnhofsvorplatz), which is located between the station and Wei√üeritzstra√üe, was rebuilt in 2011 for around ‚Ç¨850,000. A 23-metre-long ribbon of granite boulders and replicas of bright red stones made of fiberglass has been created on the forecourt to commemorate the former course of the Wei√üeritz  Construction Northern track field with the exit to the Marien bridge Dresden Mitte station is a through station with four platform edges. S-Bahn trains stop only on tracks 1 and 2. Tracks 3 and 4 are used as a stop for regional trains and for through traffic. Two other tracks on the eastern side of the station serve freight traffic. On the southern approach to the station, the line of the Berlin‚ÄìDresden Railway Company branches through the Dresden- Friedrichstadt freight yard. North of the station is the Marien bridge over the Elbe.  Transport significance Its central location within Dresden and the many interchanges possibilities at the station make it of great importance for local and regional transport. All regional trains as well as the two S-Bahn lines that run over the Dresden connecting railway stop here. There is connection to four tram lines (1, 2, 6, 10) and a bus route (94).

This goal is to automatically gather richer information about what people are doing, typically to improve the design of an interface. Often this is done on the Web and can supplement eye tracking in some situations. When mouse tracking takes place without the user's consent, for example on a website, there may be privacy implications.  History  The computer mouse was first invented in 1968 by Douglas Engelbart. The term mouse tracking originally referred to how movements were captured and transmitted to the computer. For example, the original tracker ball mouse used a metal bearing pressed against two rollers to track movement. Much research and technology has gone into what type of tracker provides the most accurate depiction of the user's movement. With the advent of the World Wide Web, mouse tracking was expanded to include click data. Researchers and developers would track and record each time a user used the mouse to click something on the website, as well as the location of the event. Web developers use these mouse clicks to assess what information users are interested in and how they interact with a page. Additionally, advertisers are interested in click data in terms of banner advertisements and where to place their ads on pages to get the most click-throughs. More recently, the term mouse tracking has been expanded even more to develop a much broader area of research in helping understand the human-computer interaction (HCI). This development began with eye tracking. While eye tracking has been around since the 1800s, it was not used in HCI until the 1980, primarily to help answer questions about how users search for commands in computer menus and to develop systems to help disabled users. More recently, eye tracking has been used in usability testing on web pages to understand a user's point of focus as well as test the usability of different features of a site, such as dropdown menus. This information can influence Web design so it meets the researcher's goals yet is user friendly. The problem with using eye tracking in usability testing is the required hardware and then expense. Additionally, eye tracking is limited to small sample sizes and abnormal browsing environments. Mouse tracking, on the other hand, is inexpensive and the data can be collected from any computer. It is in this capacity that mouse tracking was re-invented in HCI research. Eye tracking researchers in the late 1990s noticed patterns between the eye and mouse movements. Based on these findings, researchers who had been tracking click data realized there might be more to learn from the mouse. In 2001 Mon-Chu Chen, John Anderson, and Myeong-Ho Sohn at Carnegie Mellon University, began explicitly investigating whether tracking mouse movements could be used as a proxy for tracking eye movements. This research has continued through the 2000s and to the present. The general findings in the research are that the correlation is not one to one, but there is a relationship between eye and mouse movements, which, in turn suggests mouse movements can in fact be used to determine a user's focus of attention. More recent research has shown that the correlation depends strongly on the user behavior at that time, such as whether the user is reading with the mouse, moving it to perform a click, or leaving it idle. Furthermore, the mouse position actually correlates better with past eye-gaze positions, meaning that people will typically look somewhere before moving their mouse there about 700ms later. Generally, tracking mouse positions can lead to a vast improvement to understanding the user compared with relying on mouse clicks only. In other words, click data informed researchers of a users' primary focus of attention, or their end choice. However, looking at all of the mouse movements can inform the researcher to other options that were of interest to the user but were not selected by clicking, which can lead to better overall understanding of the user's thought process. The most recent research in this area is using this knowledge to improve websites and applications. Specifically, researchers are trying to parse out what different individual movements mean as well as beginning to use mouse tracking in usability testing to improve products and pages.  Mouse tracking technology and techniques   Javascript  JavaScript is a scripting language which supports multiple programming styles. It runs on the user's interface, does not require constant downloads from the website. JavaScript is implemented as part of a Web browser in order to provide and is supported by all the major web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. This programming can provide access to objects within a host environment. Therefore, using this language, Web developers can track user's mouse movements simply by entering lines of code on a page. It does not require any additional software to be installed on the user's computer, they only have to have JavaScript enabled to for the researcher to collect data from the Webpage. Mouse tracking using JavaScript has been deployed on high-traffic websites such as search engines to collect mouse movement data without affecting the user's computer performance.  Plug-ins  A plug-in can be a hardware or software module adds a specific feature or service to a larger system. In the case of mouse tracking, the plug-ins are software modules. Plug-ins are designed to enable customizing the features of an application or program. The mouse tracking data provided by plug-ins is not different from that obtained through JavaScript. The only difference is using plug-ins requires the user to have specific software installed.  Data  Current mouse tracking tools provide a variety of data including the location of the mouse (in terms of pixels), time stamps, any time the mouse hovers on a link of interest, mouse clicks, time spent in areas of interest, and duration of hovers. Additionally, some tracking tools provide more high level analyses, such as heat maps and playbacks which can retrace the mouse's trajectory.

By using mouse movements in usability testing, researchers can determine if users are confused, if their expectations are met, where their attention is focused, and much additional information. This tool can be especially beneficial in conjunction with other techniques used in usability testing, such as think aloud procedures, as this information can lead to a better mouse movement model.  Real-time website adaptation  Tracking mouse movements can be used to adapt interfaces in real time based on respondents' interests. Researchers can use information, such as where respondents hold the mouse for an extended period of time and the trajectory of the mouse, to assess their level of interest in that object. The knowledge gained from this can be used to re-sort search criteria based on individual relevancy and suggest other objects, products, or information that might be of interest to the user.  Web design and evaluation  Mouse tracking allows Web developers to view the behaviors of actual users in their natural browsing environment instead of in a laboratory. By tracking where the mouse is located, designers can evaluate the ease of use of their Websites. Specifically, they can see how difficult it is for users to find and use certain features, such as scroll bars or dropdown menus, or to locate important links. Additionally, developers can see what parts of the pages users are most interested in, which can influence page layout if they are not focused where the designer wants them.  Online security  An example of how mouse movements can be used for online security is as follows. Each computer user has their own unique way of using the mouse. Some people rarely engage the mouse until they need it to complete an action, while others are very active with their mouse and use it to read along with text on a page. For users who are active with their mouse, researchers have successfully been able to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù a user‚Äôs typical behavior through a supervised learning method. Once this behavior is learned, it can be linked to an individual‚Äôs account. If the behavior of a user deviates significantly from that user's learned, typical behavior, they can be locked out of the system until their identity is verified. This is another way of ensuring a user is who they claim to be.  Education  Mouse tracking has been used in education to help understand the impact of reading on a computer as opposed to paper and propose ways that reading on a computer could be adapted so understanding and learning were easier. It has also been used to identify off-task behaviors in tutoring settings and in physics to understand how students perceive and process multimedia representations of real experiments.

Held under British mediation, its participants were the unrecognised government of Rhodesia, led by Ian Smith, and a number of rival Rhodesian black nationalist parties: the African National Council, led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa; the Front for the Liberation of Zimbabwe, led by James Chikerema; and a joint \\"Patriotic Front\\" made up of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union and the Zimbabwe African People's Union led by Joshua Nkomo. The purpose of the conference was to attempt to agree on a new constitution for Rhodesia and in doing so find a way to end the Bush War raging between the government and the guerrillas commanded by Mugabe and Nkomo respectively. The Geneva Conference had its origins in the South African \\"d√©tente\\" policy instituted in late 1974, and more directly in the peace initiative headed by the United States Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, earlier in 1976. After the Kissinger plan was rejected by the nationalists, talks were organised in Geneva by Britain to try to salvage a deal. The proceedings began on 28 October 1976, eight days behind schedule, and were chaired by a British mediator, Ivor Richard, who offended both delegations before the conference even started. When Richard read an opening statement from British prime minister James Callaghan which referred to the country as \\"Zimbabwe\\", the nationalists were somewhat placated, while Smith's team was insulted yet further. Little progress was made during the two sides' discussions, causing the conference to be indefinitely adjourned on 14 December 1976. It was never reconvened. Background British prime minister alt=A photograph of Harold Wilson Following a dispute over the terms for the granting of full statehood, the predominantly white minority government of Rhodesia, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, unilaterally declared independence from Britain on 11 November 1965. Because British prime minister Harold Wilson and Whitehall had been insisting on an immediate transfer to majority rule before independence, this declaration went unrecognised and caused Britain and the United Nations (UN) to impose economic sanctions on Rhodesia. The two most prominent black nationalist parties in Rhodesia were the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU)‚Äîa predominantly Shona movement, influenced by Chinese Maoism‚Äîand the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), which was Marxist‚ÄìLeninist, and mostly Ndebele. ZANU and its military wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), received considerable backing in training, materiel and finances from the People's Republic of China and its allies, while the Warsaw Pact and associated nations, prominently Cuba, gave similar support to ZAPU and its Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA).; ZAPU and ZIPRA were headed by Joshua Nkomo throughout their existence, while the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole founded and initially led ZANU. The two rival nationalist movements launched what they called their \\"Second Chimurenga\\" against the Rhodesian government and security forces during the mid-1960s. The army, air force and police successfully repulsed numerous guerrilla incursions, most of which were perpetrated by ZIPRA, over the rest of that decade. After abortive talks between Smith and Wilson in 1966 and 1968, a constitution was agreed upon by the Rhodesian and British governments in November 1971; however, when a British test of Rhodesian public opinion was undertaken in early 1972, black opinion was judged to be against the new deal, causing it to be shelved. The Rhodesian Bush War suddenly re- erupted in December 1972, after two years of relative inactivity, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. After a successful security force counter-campaign during 1973 and 1974, drastic changes in the foreign policy of the Rhodesian government's two main backers, Portugal and South Africa, caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the nationalists' favour. In April 1974, the Portuguese government was overthrown by a military coup and replaced with a leftist administration in favour of ending the unpopular Colonial War in Angola, Mozambique and Portugal's other African territories. The institution by Pretoria of a d√©tente initiative in late 1974 forced a ceasefire in Rhodesia, and in June 1975 Mozambique became independent from Portugal under a communist government allied with ZANU. Unsuccessful rounds of talks were held between the Rhodesian government and the nationalists, united under the banner of Abel Muzorewa's African National Council, across the Victoria Falls Bridge in August 1975, then directly between the government and ZAPU starting in December 1975. Around this time, Robert Mugabe replaced Sithole as ZANU leader, winning an internal leadership election which Sithole refused to recognise. Guerrilla incursions picked up strongly in the first months of 1976, leading Smith to declare on the evening of 6 February 1976 that \\"a new terrorist offensive has begun and, to defeat it, Rhodesians will have to face heavier military commitments.\\" Security force reports indicated that around 1,000 insurgent fighters were active within Rhodesia, with a further 15,000 encamped in various states of readiness in Mozambique. Prelude: Kissinger initiative alt=A head-and-shoulders photograph, in grayscale, of Henry Kissinger, looking to the viewer's left with a thoughtful expression on his face. The United States Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, announced a formal interest in the Rhodesian situation in February 1976, and spent the rest of the year holding discussions with the British, South African and Frontline governments to produce a mutually satisfactory proposal. The plan that Kissinger eventually presented would give a transition period of two years before majority rule began, during which time an interim government would take control while a specially convened \\"council of state\\", made up of three whites, three blacks and a white chairman, drew up a new constitution. This constitution would have to result in majority rule at the end of the two-year interim period. This plan was supported by Kenneth Kaunda and Julius Nyerere, the presidents of Zambia and Tanzania respectively, which South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster said guaranteed its acceptance by the black nationalists. Vorster had no reply when Smith ventured that he had said the same thing before the Victoria Falls talks in 1975, when Kaunda and Nyerere had agreed on no preconditions for talks, then allowed the nationalists to seek them. Smith met Kissinger in Pretoria on 18 September 1976 to discuss the terms. The American diplomat told the prime minister that although he was obliged to take part, his participation in what he termed the \\"demise of Rhodesia\\" was \\"one of the great tragedies of my life\\". All the same, he encouraged Smith strongly to accept the deal he placed on the table, though he knew it was unpalatable, as any future offer could only be worse. Western opinion was already \\"soft and decadent\\", Kissinger warned, and would become even more so if, as projected, American President Gerald Ford lost that year's presidential election to Jimmy Carter. A session including Kissinger, Smith and Vorster then began, and here Smith relayed his concern that his acceptance could be perceived by the Rhodesian electorate as \\"selling out\\" and could cause a mass exodus of skilled workers and investment, which would in turn severely damage the country's economy. Vorster requested a break in the session and took Smith's team into a private side-room, accompanied by South African Foreign Minister Hilgard Muller. There he privately informed Smith that it was no longer viable for South Africa to support Rhodesia financially and militarily, and that Smith should make up his mind quickly and announce his acceptance that evening. This ultimatum deeply shocked the Rhodesian team; two of Smith's ministers, Desmond Lardner-Burke and Jack Mussett, were unable to contain their anger and vociferously berated the South African prime minister for his \\"irresponsibility\\", leading Vorster to rise from his seat without a word and leave the room. The Rhodesians were then summoned back out into the main lounge, where Kissinger insisted that their prime minister sit next to him. \\"Ian Smith made accepting the deal worse by acting like a gentleman,\\" Kissinger later said. Vorster opened the discussion by announcing that he had applied no pressure to the Rhodesian delegates, which caused further consternation amongst the Rhodesians which they had difficulty suppressing. It was agreed that the Rhodesians should return to Salisbury and consult their cabinet, then announce their answer. Despite expressing \\"incredulity\\" at what had happened in Pretoria, and showing deep reluctance, the politicians in Salisbury resolved that despite what they perceived as \\"South African treachery\\" the responsible course of action could only be to go on with the peace process, and that meant accepting Kissinger's terms, which they agreed were better than any they could get in the future should they refuse. Smith announced his government's answer on the evening of 24 September 1976: \\"Yes.\\" South Africa's wavering financial and military assistance suddenly became available again, but the Frontline States then abruptly changed tack and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any interim period before majority rule was unacceptable. A new constitutional conference in Geneva, Switzerland, was hastily organised by Britain to try to salvage something from the wreckage, with 20 October 1976 set as the start date. Geneva Conference ZANU and ZAPU announced on 9 October that they would attend this conference and any thereafter as a joint \\"Patriotic Front\\" (PF), including members of both parties under a combined leadership. Kaunda and Nyerere welcomed the new negotiations, but with the Soviet Union proposing that they once again alter their line, the talks were delayed indefinitely. In an attempt to encourage the other parties to travel to Switzerland, British mediator Ivor Richard asked the Rhodesian delegation to hasten their arrival, which they did, leaving Salisbury on 20 October 1976. Richard himself did not arrive until two days later. Some of the guerrillas arriving for the conference from the heat of Mozambique were unprepared for the Swiss winter: Rex Nhongo, for example, felt so cold that he turned every heating appliance in his room, including the stove, to maximum and went to sleep. When the room caught fire, he was forced to jump from the balcony in his pyjamas. Even arranging the conference proved a struggle, with the Rhodesians taking exception to being served cards of admittance on 27 October denoting them \\"The Smith Delegation\\", rather than the \\"Rhodesian Government Delegation\\" as had happened in previous conferences and correspondence. The Rhodesians unilaterally altered their cards to this effect, then confronted Richard with them, causing him some shock. The conference was eventually arranged to commence on 28 October at 15:00, but at very short notice the British mediator delayed the start for two hours; some Patriotic Front delegates were questioning his role as chairman and threatening not to attend, and Richard hoped to talk them around in the extra time. When the parties finally met, some hours later than planned, Muzorewa sat opposite Smith as the leader of the nationalist delegates, as at Victoria Falls, but with empty seats directly either side of him, marked \\"Comrade Enos Nkala\\" and \\"Comrade Edson Sithole\\" respectively‚Äîeach of these ZANU cadres had refused to attend the opening meeting despite Richard's entreaties. The mediator read an opening statement from British prime minister James Callaghan which, to the nationalists' delight and the government's chagrin, referred to the country as \\"Zimbabwe\\". The proceedings were then adjourned, to start again the next day. On the morning of 29 October, Mugabe and Nkomo spoke in turn, giving emotionally charged speeches about the \\"dreadful sacrifices which the white governments have exacted from the poor black people\\". Neither made any comment relevant to a new constitution. Muzorewa then told the story of the life of the Ndebele King Lobengula in reverent tones, before Sithole made the only directly relevant nationalist contribution of the day, saying simply that he hoped the two sides could come to an agreement. A few days' break were then agreed as constitutional lawyers drew up a plan based on Kissinger's for the delegates to discuss. The American election result came through on the morning of 2 November 1976; as expected, Carter had won. In Geneva, meanwhile, it soon became clear that while the Rhodesians wished to stick to the plan they had agreed with Kissinger, the nationalists had no intention of doing so, regarding those terms only as a starting point for further negotiation. They continually interrupted the lawyers' work with new demands, meaning that by 8 November practically no progress had been made. A meeting was organised for the next day, 9 November: the chaotic parley led nowhere, with the nationalists once again taking turns to make long, irrelevant speeches while the Rhodesians attempted to have Richard return the subject to the new constitution. Smith, who had earlier supported Richard as mediator in the face of the nationalists' criticism, became very frustrated by Richard's refusal to be firm with the PF and restore order to the proceedings. Unproductive discussions continued for another month, with Mugabe persistently arriving late to the meetings. When Rhodesian minister P K van der Byl confronted Mugabe about his tardiness and tersely demanded an apology, the ZANU leader became enraged and screamed, \\"Foul-mouthed bloody fool!\\" Abandonment Finally, on 14 December 1976, British Foreign Minister Anthony Crosland announced that the conference was to be adjourned. It was never reconvened‚Äîthe Patriotic Front now said that it would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule was made the only subject for discussion. Apparently believing that the British and Rhodesians were secretly working together to prevent this, Nkomo laid down pre-conditions for any new conference. \\"The Rhodesian situation is a war situation ... On our side it is the Patriotic Front, and on the British ... side it is the British government with the Rhodesian r√©gime as [its] extension. ... The agenda must have only one item ... the transfer of power from the minority to the majority. This means a constitution based on universal adult suffrage. ... This item should take four to five days.\\" Notes and references Notes References Bibliography   * Category:1976 conferences Category:1976 in international relations Category:1976 in Switzerland Category:1976 in Rhodesia Category:20th-century diplomatic conferences Category:Diplomatic conferences in Switzerland Category:Foreign relations of Rhodesia Category:History of Rhodesia Category:ZANU‚ÄìPF Category:Rhodesian Bush War ","title":"Geneva Conference (1976)"},{"id":"33924367","title":"Alex Newell"},{"id":"33924371","text":"Hypena ophiusoides is a moth in the family Erebidae first described by Frederic Moore in 1882.

The Alpha was announced at the end of 2011 and production started in 2012.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015‚Äì16, page 73. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. Based on the design of the Pipistrel Virus, it is intended to be a low-cost solution for LSA flight training both in the acquisition and operating costs, while still including a full airframe emergency recovery parachute system as standard equipment. The electric version of the Alpha Trainer was announced in 2015, and as of January 2020, it remained the only commercially available electric airplane in the world, with the exception of electric motorgliders. Design and development The Rotax-powered Alpha Trainer The aircraft features a cantilever high-wing, a two-seats in side-by-side configuration, tricycle landing gear and a single Rotax 912 UL engine in tractor configuration. It was designed to comply with the US light-sport aircraft rules. The aerodynamic design is based on the Pipistrel Virus but structurally redesigned to simplify the manufacture and maintenance. The aircraft is made from single-skin laminate composite, instead of the honeycomb layup found in the Virus. The landing gear was reinforced for training use, and the main wheels' differential brakes replaced with a central brake lever between the seats. The cockpit is equipped with traditional and cheaper round-dial style flight instruments and a GPS, rather than a full glass cockpit. Air brakes are optional to offer simpler controls and the flaperons redesigned to have 25 degrees of flap travel for easy short-field landings. A full airframe emergency ballistic parachute is included as standard equipment. The fuel consumption is projected to be per hour when used in the training role and conducting touch-and-go circuits. The fuel tank allows an endurance of more than 4 hours. Its initial price of US$85,000 was intended to address moves by Pipistrel's competition in raising prices on their aircraft. In particular, the Alpha's price was initially set well below the then-current US$149,000 price announced for the comparable Cessna 162. As of April 2020, the base price ranged between ‚Ç¨65,000 (US$70,100) and ‚Ç¨86,800 (US$93,600), depending on the country-specific regulatory requirements. Variants Alpha Electro Alpha Electro Pipistrel introduced an electric version called the Alpha Electro in 2015 at a price of 69,000 euros, with technology from the Pipistrel WATTsUP proof of concept design, for short training. It has energy for one flight hour plus reserves, and can recharge in 45 minutes or have its batteries replaced in 5 minutes. Instead of 78 lb (35.5 kg) of fuel, it has 277 pounds (126 kg) of LiPo cells, however the water cooled electric motor weighs 11 kg; much less than the gasoline engine. It has a useful load of 380 lb, whereas a Cessna 152 has between 350‚Äì480 lb useful load. After 38 minutes of flying various manoeuvres, battery charge may be 25%. From the inside, the Electro is very similar to the gasoline-powered version, but from the outside, the Electro is much quieter. Electricity costs are about 1/10 of gasoline. The Electro is now certified in the USA. In 2015 Pipistrel intended to fly the Electro from France to England two days before the Airbus E-Fan, but was prevented by Siemens. Four Electro aircraft will be used to provide flight training in Fresno, California starting in late 2017 as part of the Sustainable Aviation Project.

After being sold for a world record price as a yearling in 1890, she was undefeated as a two-year-old in 1891, winning races against her own sex and defeating some of the year's leading colts. She went on to become the dominant British three-year-old of 1892, claiming the Fillies‚Äô Triple Crown by winning the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket, the Oaks at Epsom and the St Leger at Doncaster. Her only defeat of the year came when she finished second when starting favourite for The Derby. La Fleche remained in training for a further two seasons, winning important races such as the 1893 Liverpool Autumn Cup, the 1894 Ascot Gold Cup, and the Champion Stakes on her final appearance. In all, she won sixteen times in twenty-four racecourse appearances. After her retirement from racing she became a successful and influential broodmare. Background La Fleche (French for The Arrow), a brown mare standing just under 16 hands high was bred by the Royal Studs at Hampton Court and was foaled on 10 March 1889. She was an exceptionally well-bred and \\"beautiful\\" filly and attracted much attention when she was sent to be auctioned as a yearling on 28 June 1890 at the Bushey Paddocks. She was bought by Lord Marcus Beresford on behalf of the financier Baron Maurice de Hirsch for a sum of 5,500 guineas, outbidding the Duke of Portland and John Porter and breaking the record for a yearling sold at auction, which had stood since 1876. Her sire, St Simon was an unbeaten racehorse who was beginning to prove himself as an outstanding sire. By the time La Fleche was sold in 1890 he was on the way to the first of his nine sires‚Äô championships, having sired the first two of his ten Classic winners. Her dam, Quiver produced La Fleche‚Äôs full-sister Memoir, who won the Epsom Oaks and the St Leger as well as the influential broodmares Maid Marian and Satchel. La Fleche was trained for her first two seasons by John Porter at Kingsclere. At the end of her three-year-old season she was moved to the Egerton House stable of Richard Marsh at Newmarket, Suffolk. Attempts by anglophone writers to spell her name resulted in variations including La Fl√©che, Lafleche, La Fl√®che (the \\"correct\\" version), and La Fl√™che. Racing career 1891: two-year-old season John Porter, La Fleche's trainer in 1891-2 La Fleche won all four of her races as a two- year-old. She made her first appearance on 16 July at Newmarket in the Chesterfield Stakes, for which she started 6/4 favourite. Although she had not grown as much as might have been expected from her yearling days, she was reported to be deceptively powerful, being described by one observer as \\"all wire and whipcord.\\" Ridden by George Barrett, she led from the start and shook off he rivals \\"without an effort\\" to win by two lengths, in an impressive time of 1:04.2. The third placed finisher, a colt called Bonavista (or Bona Vista), went on to win the following year's 2000 Guineas. On 29 July, La Fleche was sent to Goodwood for the five furlong Lavant Stakes in which she met Priestess, another filly whose sale price (¬£4,000) had attracted comment. La Fleche tracked Priestess, who set a strong pace, before moving ahead in the final furlong to win \\"very cleverly\\" by a length. Two days later, she reappeared at the same course for the Molecomb Stakes and recorded another easy win, beating Adoration by one and a half lengths. At Doncaster in September she won the Champagne Stakes to take her earnings for the year to ¬£3,415. La Fleche's stable companion, Orme, was regarded as the best of the year's two-year-old colts, and there was speculation as to which of the two was the better. It was also generally believed that La Fleche would have the Derby as her principal target for the following year. 1892: three-year-old season =Spring= 1892 began with a scare for La Fleche's owners as the filly slipped and injured her knees at her stable. Initial fears that her career could be over however, proved to be unfounded as the damage was superficial. Confidence in the filly grew steadily over the winter and early spring, and by late April she had supplanted Orme as Derby favourite. Her position at the head of the market was strengthened when Orme was poisoned- unsubstantiated rumours blamed the filly's supporters- and ruled out for the first half of the season. On 6 May 1892 La Fleche started 1/2 favourite in a field of seven for the 1000 Guineas. Her price might have been even shorter but for fears that she too could have been \\"got at\\". Ridden by George Barrett she raced in second place as Adoration set the pace before moving easily into the lead a furlong out. She won by a length from The Smew and Adoration in a time of 1:52.4, which was 1.6 seconds faster than the time recorded by Bona Vista in winning the 2000 Guineas over the same course. =Summer= At Epsom on 1 June La Fleche started 11/10 favourite for the Derby on a \\"gloriously fine\\" day. She was saddled and paraded separately from the colts for reasons that correspondents chose not to particularise. The French-trained colt Bucentaur led the field into the straight where he was overtaken by the 40/1 outsider Sir Hugo. La Fleche then produced her challenge but after a \\"splendid finish\\" in which she was cheered on by the crowd, she failed to overhaul the colt and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length. There were later claims that La Fleche‚Äôs defeat had been a fluke and Barrett was criticised for giving her a \\"most erratic ride\\". This version of events is not supported by contemporary accounts, which state that the filly was in a \\"capital position\\" throughout the race. Two days after her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some regarded her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie before taking the lead in the straight apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she had dealt with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half. =Autumn= Maurice de Hirsch, La Fleche's owner On 7 September La Fleche ran in the St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who had returned from his problems to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly in the early stages as Orme set off in front. Just after the turn into the straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against older and younger horses in the ¬£10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced. At Newmarket five days later she faced only one opponent, a colt called Dunure, in the Grand Duke Michael Stakes. She started at odds of 1/40 and won the ¬£1,000 prize in a predictable canter. In the Newmarket Oaks on 11 October she ran lazily but won very easily by a length from Golconda, to whom she was conceding nineteen pounds. She was then sent for the Cambridgeshire Handicap 26 October, for which she was assigned a weight of 122 pounds. La Fleche started 7/2 favourite in a field of thirty runners and was ridden by Barrett. The closing stages of the nine furlong race developed into a contest between La Fleche and Pensioner, a colt who was carrying only 88 pounds. The filly showed \\"fire and resolution\\" at the finish to pull away from the colt and win by one and a half lengths. The win took her earnings for the season to ¬£23,848, all of which was donated to charity by Hirsch. At the end of the season La Fleche, and all of Maurice de Hirsch‚Äôs other horses were moved from the yard of John Porter to that of Richard Marsh. The move followed a disagreement between Hirsch's racing manager, Marcus Beresford, and another of Porter's important patrons, the Duke of Westminster 1893: four-year-old season In early 1893, La Fleche was reported to be wonderfully \\"fresh and well\\" although she showed no signs of having grown. She did not appear in public however, until 14 July, when she ran in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. She started evens favourite against five opponents, most notably Orme, who started on 2/1. Barrett moved the filly up to challenge in the straight, but she soon came under pressure and although she ran on \\"gamely\\" she could finish only third behind Orme and Medicis. Two weeks later at Goodwood, Orme again proved superior, beating the filly by a neck in the Gordon Stakes, despite veering sharply left inside the last furlong. In Autumn La Fleche attempted to win a second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had been expected to lie between La Fleche and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried a weight of 154 pounds. On 25 October she found a weight of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap. 1894: five-year-old season Before the start of the 1894 season, La Fleche was covered by the Gold Cup winner Morion, and raced in foal (pregnant) for the rest of the year. At Royal Ascot on 15 June she started 2/5 favourite for the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup, in which her biggest danger appeared to be the French colt Callistrate. Watts held the mare up at the back of the field before moving her up to challenge Callistrate entering the straight. She soon went clear and won \\"in splendid style\\" by three lengths. One day later she ran in the Hardwicke Stakes and started the 1/5 favourite. In the straight however, she was never able to get on terms with the colt Ravensbury, and finished second, beaten half a length. The Prince of Wales reportedly lost heavily on the race. On her final start of the year she met Ravensbury again in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 9 October. As the owners of Isinglass had turned down a challenge to run his horse against La Fleche, they were the only two runners and the mare, ridden by Watts started at odds of 1/3. La Fleche opened up a clear lead in the early stages and was never in danger of defeat, winning \\"in a canter\\" by eight lengths. As the mare galloped up the hill with her ears pricked, she was given an enthusiastic reception from the Newmarket crowd who knew they were witnessing her final race. Assessment La Fleche as a broodmare in 1903. After her win in the St Leger, La Fleche was described as \\"one of the best fillies that ever raced in England.\\" Her earnings of ¬£25,635 were by far the highest for any horse in 1892 and by the end of her second season, she had already earned more in prize money than any other filly. On her retirement it was said that she had been \\"nothing short of an Idol\\" with the public. Breeding record As noted above, La Fleche was already in foal when racing in 1894 and produced her first foal, a filly called La Veine by Morion in 1895. In 1896 Maurice de Hirsch died and all his bloodstock, including La Fleche and La Veine were put up for auction. She was sold for ¬£12,600 to Marcus Beresford, acting on this occasion on behalf the Sykes family and was sent to their Sledmere Stud in Yorkshire. Sir Tatton Sykes, who was reportedly horrified by the price, initially refused to acknowledge the mare‚Äôs arrival, and left her in a railway box for two weeks before he was persuaded to accept the deal. La Fleche‚Äôs best runner was John O‚ÄôGaunt, who finished second in the Derby and sired Swynford. Her daughter Baroness La Fleche, by Ladas, produced the 1000 Guineas winner Cinna, who in turn produced the successful stallion Beau Pere. La Fleche was retired from breeding in 1911, and she died at Sledmere in late April 1916 at the age of twenty-seven.

It is produced by making cellulose a soluble compound by combining it with copper and ammonia. The solution of this material in caustic soda is passed through a spinneret and the cellulose is regenerated in hardening baths that remove the copper and ammonia and neutralize the caustic soda. Cuprammonium rayon is usually made in fine filaments that are used in lightweight summer dresses and blouses, sometimes in combination with cotton to make textured fabrics with slubbed, uneven surfaces. The fabric is commonly known by the trade name \\"Bemberg\\", owned by the J.P. Bemberg company. The fabric may also be known as \\"cupro\\" or \\"cupra\\". It is also known as \\"ammonia silk\\" on Chinese fashion retail websites. History Cuprammonium rayon was invented in 1890. Properties There are many properties of cuprammonium rayon: * The fibers are very fine * It has a soft, silk-like handle (i.e., tactile feel) * It has similar properties to cotton. It is different in that the average degree of polymerization is lower and a larger part of this fiber is occupied by amorphous regions, causing cuprammonium rayon to swell more * It burns rapidly and chars at 180¬∞C * On ignition, it leaves behind ash containing copper * It can be used to create fabric that is sheer and lightweight and has desirable draping properties Production Cellulose is dissolved in [Cu(NH3)4](OH)2 solution and then regenerated as rayon when extruded into sulfuric acid.

The film was written by Miroslav Lekiƒá, Slobodan Stanojeviƒá and Igor Bojoviƒá. The plot is based on Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá's novel of the same name. The main motive of the film is the eventually disclosed nonsense of ethnic division in Bosnia, pointing out to the same historical origin of both opposed ethnic groups, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims - Orthodox Christians and Sunni Muslims, respectively. Set in the 1960s and observed from the point of view of Alija Osmanoviƒá, a young Muslim medical student raised by a single mother, his entire family slaughtered and his baby brother kidnaped by Serbs in Second World War, as the aftermath of Jugoviƒái (Christian) and Osmanoviƒái (Muslim) violent family feud, he learns not only that Osmanoviƒái were once but a branch of Jugoviƒái family who converted to Islam during the Turkish rule, but that, unbeknownst to his mother, he himself was a baby taken from Jugoviƒái, after the massacre of Jugoviƒái on Christmas Eve in 1942. Both families now extinct, and Alia as the descendant of both, torn between two cultures and two identities, he struggles to maintain his inner peace, desperately searching for his long lost step-brother and fighting the prejudices against the love relationship he has with a Serbian colleague student. Based on true events of World War II and being centered on the atrocious crimes committed to Serbs during World War II, and the particular families of Jugoviƒái and Osmanoviƒái. In 1999, the film was screened at the 13th Montenegro Film Festival, and gained five featured awards.

Plot Beavis and Butt-Head are on a class field trip to a military base (but only half of the class is there because the school's guidance counselor felt the other students were better served by visiting Hewlett-Packard) where their teacher, Mr. Van Driessen (conducting the trip under protest), tries to present a military career in non-violent and educational terms only to be cheerfully countered by an Army officer who notes the virtues of pre-emptive strikes and bluntly says that juvenile delinquents make the best warriors. Beavis and Butt-Head have to use a bathroom, so they go look for one. Meanwhile, a lazy trainee leaves the Drone Control Room to get some birthday cake. Shortly thereafter, the duo wander into the Drone Control Room, which they at first thought was a bathroom when they read it as \\"Drain Central\\". At the pilot seats, the duo thinks they are playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas when they are actually controlling drone planes in Afghanistan (the local villagers are speaking Dari). They start wreaking havoc around the city (Butt-Head) and in Afghanistan (Beavis) while looking for prostitutes, still thinking they are playing. They manage to scare civilians around the world and destroy some property. Not succeeding in finding prostitutes, they eventually get bored and leave the Drone Control Room after which a drone crashes into and destroys the Highland High school bus and two other drones crash into a foreign field. The lazy drone trainee, whose return to his job was delayed when he decided to get some ice cream to go with his cake, is mistakenly arrested for the destruction. While he's being beaten up and taken away in handcuffs by the military, Beavis and Butt-Head decide to finish their day by enjoying what is left of the birthday treats.

He next featured in the 1994 AXA Equity & Law League against Nottinghamshire, while in that same season he made his first- class debut, making two appearances in the County Championship against Kent and Somerset. Walton was used by Northamptonshire primarily as a limited-overs player, making 81 List A appearances for the county between 1992 and 1998. In these 81 matches, he scored a total of 1,369 runs at an average of 24.01, with a high score of 72. This score was one of seven half centuries he made and came against Gloucestershire in 1994.

Calderwood recorded that in 1545, a few months before his murder, Cardinal Beaton had \\"passed over the Christmasse dayes with games and feasting\\". However, the Reformation transformed attitudes to traditional Christian feasting days, including Christmas, and led in practice to the abolition of festival days and other church holidays; the Kirk and the state being closely linked in Scotland during the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. A 1640 Act of the Parliament of Scotland abolished the \\"Yule vacation and all observation thereof in time coming\\". Post-Reformation suppression of Yule Tide celebrations Two Acts of the Estates of Parliament ‚Äî Act discharging the Yule vacance (2 June 1640) and Act dischargeing the Yule vacance (15 April 1690)‚Äî abolished the Yule Vacance (Christmas recess). The first Act was partly repealed in 1686, when Episcopalianism was briefly in ascendancy within the Kirk. The second Act was partly repealed in 1712 by the Yule Vacance Act 1711 of the Westminster Parliament. The 1640 Act stated (in Middle Scots): * > \\"... the kirke within this kingdome is now purged of all superstitious > observatione of dayes... thairfor the saidis estatis have dischairged and > simply dischairges the foirsaid Yule vacance and all observation thairof in > tymecomeing, and rescindis and annullis all acts, statutis and warrandis and > ordinances whatsoevir granted at any tyme heirtofoir for keiping of the said > Yule vacance, with all custome of observatione thairof, and findis and > declaires the samene to be extinct, voyd and of no force nor effect in > tymecomeing.\\" (English translation: \\"... the kirk within this kingdom is now > purged of all superstitious observation of days... therefore the said > estates have discharged and simply discharge the foresaid Yule vacation and > all observation thereof in time coming, and rescind and annul all acts, > statutes and warrants and ordinances whatsoever granted at any time > heretofore for keeping of the said Yule vacation, with all custom of > observation thereof, and find and declare the same to be extinct, void and > of no force nor effect in time coming.\\") Robert Jamieson recorded the opinion of an English clergyman regarding the post-reformation suppression of Christmas: > \\"The ministers of Scotland, in contempt of the holy-day observed by England, > cause their wives and servants to spin in open sight of the people upon Yule > day, and their affectionate auditors constrain their servants to yoke their > plough on Yule day, in contempt of Christ's nativity. Which our Lord has not > left unpunished, for their oxen ran wud, and brak their necks and lamed some > ploughmen, which is notoriously known in some parts of Scotland.\\" Daft Days The period of festivities running from Christmas to Handsel Monday, including Hogmanay and Ne'erday, is known as the Daft Days. Post-war period Clootie dumpling Christmas in Scotland was traditionally observed very quietly because the Church of Scotland, a Presbyterian church, for various reasons never placed much emphasis on the Christmas festival. Christmas Day did not become a public holiday until 1958 in Scotland, Boxing Day only in 1974. The New Year's Eve festivity, Hogmanay, was by far the largest celebration in Scotland. The giftgiving, public holidays and feasting associated with mid-winter were traditionally held between 11 December and 6 January. However, since the 1980s, the fading of the Church's influence and the increased influences from the rest of the United Kingdom and elsewhere, Christmas and its related festivities are now nearly on par with Hogmanay and Ne'erday. Edinburgh, Glasgow and other cities now have traditional German Christmas market from late November until Christmas Eve.\\"Traditional German Christmas Market\\" Edinburgh's Christmas.

Timeline  The university had its origin as the Lagos Business School (LBS), established in 1991. The federal government approved the university as Pan-African University in 2002, and the LBS became its first school. The Ajah Campus was completed in 2003 and in 2010 work began on the Ibeju-Lekki campus. In September 2011 the university launched the Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art, a website created by Jess Castellote, a Spanish architect that includes over 400 works from 81 artists, including pioneering Nigerian artists such as Aina Onabolu and Bruce Onobrakpeya and emerging artists such as Richardson Ovbiebo and Babalola Lawson. In November and December 2011 the EDC, for the first time, marked the Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW), with a series of events in Lagos. Many Nigerians have ambitions to start a business, and the conference was extremely well-attended. EDC has been the GEW host for Nigeria since then. The University's Enterprise Development Centre (EDC) works with the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Department of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to provide the SME Toolkit Nigeria. This gives free business management information and training to small businesses. In July 2011 British Prime Minister David Cameron spoke at the Pan-Atlantic University in Lagos, discussing aid, trade and democracy. He spoke in favor of an African free trade area, and of increased trade with Britain. In May 2013 its name was changed to Pan-Atlantic University, in order to avoid confusion with the Pan-African University of the African Union. On 17 November 2014 the University launched its first ever undergraduate programmes in its new campus at Ibeju-Lekki.

It is the Anglican parish church of Stevington, and is part of the Diocese of St Albans The first church on this site, as recorded, was started in about 880 AD and the tower is the surviving part of this; the rest of the building was added later, and completed in about 1480. The church underwent significant rebuilding in 1872, sponsored by the Duke of Bedford who was Patron until 1971. The church has been without permanent clergy since the early 1980s and has relied upon Non- Stipendiary ministry ever since. It is currently in interregnum, the last Priest In Charge, Rev David Hunter, a New Zealander having resigned the post in 2006. It is believed that the body of Napoleon Bonaparte's valet from his exile on St Helena is buried in the churchyard, however, parish records are incomplete and the brick vault is too weathered for identification. The interior of the church boasts some particularly intricate Tudor carved pew ends as well as a fine rood screen now moved to the tower.
