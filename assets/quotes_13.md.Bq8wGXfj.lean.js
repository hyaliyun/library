As there are often several generations of copies between an extant copy of an ancient text and the original, each handwritten by different scribes, there is a natural tendency for extraneous material to be inserted into such documents over time. Interpolations originally may be inserted as an authentic explanatory note (for example, ), but may also be included for fraudulent purposes. The forged passages and works attributed to the Pseudo- Isidore are an example of the latter. Similarly, the letters of Ignatius of Antioch were interpolated by Apollinarian heretics, three centuries after the originals were written. Charters and legal texts are also subject to forgery of this kind. In the 13th century a medieval romance, the Prose Tristan, inserted another prose romance, the Vulgate Queste del Saint Graal, in its entirety in order to reinterpret the Quest for the Holy Grail through the optics of the Tristan story.On the Medieval technique of manuscript interpolation and the Prose Tristan, see Emmanuèle Baumgartner, \\"La préparation à la Queste del Saint Graal dans le Tristan en prose\\" in Norris Lacy, ed. Conjunctures (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1994), pp. 1-14, Fanni Bogdanow, \\"L'Invention du texte, intertextualité et le problème de la transmission et de la classification de manuscrits\\" Romania 111 (190): 121-40 and Janina P. Traxler, \\"The Use and Abuse of the Grail Quest\\" Tristania 15 (1994): 23-31. Gaston Paris, in 1897, also noted the interpolation of a verse romance on Brunor in Prose Tristan. However, most interpolations result from the errors and inaccuracies which tend to arise during hand-copying, especially over long periods of time. For example, if a scribe made an error when copying a text and omitted some lines, he would have tended to include the omitted material in the margin. However, margin notes made by readers are present in almost all manuscripts. Therefore, a different scribe seeking to produce a copy of the manuscript perhaps many years later could find it very difficult to determine whether a margin note was an omission made by the previous scribe (which should be included in the text) or simply a note made by a reader (which should be ignored or kept in the margin). Conscientious scribes tended to copy everything which appeared in a manuscript, but in all cases scribes needed to exercise personal judgement. Explanatory notes would tend to find their way into the body of a text as a natural result of this subjective process. Modern scholars have developed techniques for recognizing interpolation, which are often apparent to modern observers, but would have been less so for medieval copyists. The Comma Johanneum, for example, is commonly regarded as interpolation. The specific problem of Christian transmission of Jewish texts outside the Jewish and Christian canons is often described as Christian interpolation.

It was designed by James Paine and Kenton Couse. The bridge, which is Grade I listed, was built between 1774 and 1777, as a replacement for a ferry crossing which connected Richmond town centre on the east bank with its neighbouring district of East Twickenham to the west. Its construction was privately funded by a tontine scheme, for which tolls were charged until 1859. Because the river meanders from its general west to east direction, flowing from southeast to northwest in this part of London, what would otherwise be known as the north and south banks are often referred to as the \\"Middlesex\\" (Twickenham) and \\"Surrey\\" (Richmond) banks respectively, named after the historic counties to which each side once belonged. The bridge was widened and slightly flattened in 1937–40, but otherwise still conforms to its original design. The eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now Greater London, it is today the oldest surviving Thames bridge in London. Background The small town of Sheen on the Surrey bank of the Thames, west of the City of London or by river, had been the site of a royal palace since 1299. After it was destroyed by fire in 1497, Henry VII built a new palace on the site, naming it Richmond Palace after his historic title of Earl of Richmond, and the central part of Sheen became known as Richmond. Richmond, Twickenham Park and the route of the Richmond Ferry in 1746 Although a ferry had almost certainly existed at the site of the present-day bridge since Norman times, the earliest known crossing of the river at Richmond dates from 1439. The service was owned by the Crown, and operated by two boats, a small skiff for the transport of passengers and a larger boat for horses and small carts; the Twickenham Ferry, slightly upstream, was also in service from at least 1652. However, due to the steepness of the hill leading to the shore- line on the Surrey side neither ferry service was able to transport carriages or heavily laden carts, forcing them to make a very lengthy detour via Kingston Bridge. In the 18th century Richmond and neighbouring Twickenham on the opposite bank of the Thames, both of which were distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck. Local resident William Windham had been sub-tutor to Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, and was the former husband of Mary, Lady Deloraine, mistress to George II. As a reward for his services, George II leased Windham the right to operate the ferry until 1798. Windham sub-let the right to operate the ferry to local resident Henry Holland. With the ferry unable to serve the demands of the area, in 1772 Windham sought Parliamentary approval to replace the ferry with a wooden bridge, to be paid for by tolls. Design The plans for a wooden bridge proved unpopular, and in 1772 the Richmond Bridge Act was passed by Parliament, selecting 90 commissioners, including landscape architect Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown, historian and politician Horace Walpole and playwright and actor David Garrick, to oversee the construction of a stone bridge on the site of the ferry. The Act stipulated that no tax of any sort could be used to finance the bridge, and fixed a scale of tolls, ranging from ½d for a pedestrian to 2s 6d for a coach drawn by six horses (about 50p and £ respectively in ). Henry Holland was granted £5,350 (about £ in ) compensation for the loss of the ferry service. The commission appointed James Paine and Kenton Couse to design and build the new bridge. Richmond Bridge The Act specified that the bridge was to be built on the site of the existing ferry \\"or as much lower down the river as the Commission can settle\\". Local residents lobbied for it to be built at Water Lane, a short distance downstream from the ferry site. The approach to the river was relatively flat, avoiding the steep slope to the existing ferry pier on the Surrey bank. However, the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle refused to allow the approach road on the Middlesex bank to pass through her land at Twickenham Park, and the commission was forced to build on the site of the ferry, despite a steep 1 in 16 (6.25%) incline. The bridge was designed as a stone arch bridge of in length and in width, supported by five elliptical arches of varying heights. The tall wide central span was designed to allow shipping to pass, giving Richmond Bridge a distinctive humpbacked appearance. It was built in Portland stone, and ran between Ferry Hill (Bridge Street today) on the Surrey side and Richmond Road on the Middlesex side; sharp curves in the approach roads on the Middlesex side (still in existence today) were needed to avoid the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle's land at Twickenham Park. Palladian toll houses were built in alcoves at each end. Construction The milestone at the Surrey end of the bridge The building was put out to tender, and on 16 May 1774 Thomas Kerr was awarded the contract to build the bridge for the sum of £10,900 (about £ in ). With additional costs, such as compensating landowners and building new approach roads, total costs came to approximately £26,000 (about £ in ). Most of the money needed was raised from the sale of shares at £100 each (approximately £ in ) in two tontine schemes, the first for £20,000 and the second for £5,000. The first was appropriately called the Richmond-Bridge Tontine, but when it became clear that the initial £20,000 would not be sufficient to complete construction a second tontine was set up. Each investor was guaranteed a return of 4% per annum, so £1,000 per annum from the income raised from tolls was divided amongst the investors in the two tontines. On the death of a shareholder their share of the dividend was divided among the surviving shareholders. To avoid fraud, each investor was obliged to sign an affidavit that they were alive before receiving their dividend.The tontine shares were transferable, although the payment of the dividend relied on the survival of the original investor. Any revenue over the £1,000 per annum required to pay the investors was held in a general fund for the maintenance of the bridge. Construction began on 23 August 1774. The Prince of Wales was invited to lay the first stone but declined, and so the stone was laid by commission member Henry Hobart. The bridge opened to pedestrians in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777, at which time the ferry service was closed, although work on the bridge was not completed until December 1777. A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns. Operation There was no formal opening ceremony, and little initial recorded public reaction. However, the bridge soon became much admired for its design; an article in The London Magazine in 1779 said that the bridge was \\"a simple, yet elegant structure, and, from its happy situation, is ... one of the most beautiful ornaments of the river ... from whatever point of view the bridge is beheld, it presents the spectator with one of the richest landscapes nature and art ever produced by their joint efforts, and connoisseurs in painting will instantly be reminded of some of the best performances of Claude Lorraine\\".The London Magazine, September 1779, quoted in James Paine proudly illustrated it among the designs in the second volume of his Plans, Elevations, and Sections of Noblemen and Gentlemen's Houses, 1783.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600–1840, 3rd ed. (Yale University Press), 1995, s.v. \\"James Paine\\". The volume was reprinted by the Gregg Press in 1967 Richmond Bridge was the subject of paintings by many leading artists, including Thomas Rowlandson, John Constable and local resident J. M. W. Turner. Richmond Bridge by Thomas Rowlandson, c. 1810 Severe penalties were imposed for vandalising the bridge. The Richmond Bridge Act 1772 specified that the punishment for \\"willful or malicious damage\\" to the bridge should be \\"transportation to one of His Majesty's Colonies in America for the space of seven years\\". A warning against damage can still be seen on the milestone at the Surrey end of the bridge. Richmond Bridge was a commercial success, generating £1,300 per annum in tolls (about £ in ) in 1810. By 1822, the company had accumulated a sufficient surplus that all vehicle tolls were reduced to one penny. Alcove on the site of a former tollbooth On 10 March 1859 the last subscriber to the main tontine died, having for over five years received the full £800 per annum set aside for subscribers to the first tontine, and with the death of its last member the scheme expired.The smaller second tontine continued until the death of its last shareholder in 1865, paying a total of £200 per annum; for the last six years this was paid from the accumulated toll revenues of previous years. On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll-free. A large procession made its way to the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges. The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83 years the tolls had been charged was sufficient to pay for the bridge's maintenance. In 1846 the first railway line reached Richmond. Richmond gasworks opened in 1848, and Richmond began to develop into a significant town. § XVI. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting it to the London Underground. Commuting to central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas. 20th-century remodelling By the early 20th century the bridge was proving inadequate for the increasing traffic, particularly with the introduction of motorised transport, and a speed limit was enforced. With the remaining investment income from tolls insufficient to pay for major reconstruction, on 31 March 1931 the bridge was taken into the joint public ownership of Surrey and Middlesex councils, and proposals were made to widen it. The plans were strongly opposed on aesthetic grounds, and the decision was taken to build instead a new bridge a short distance downstream to relieve traffic pressure. The join between the narrow 1770s structure and the paler 1930s widening is clearly visible under the bridge arches The new Twickenham Bridge opened in 1933, but Richmond Bridge was still unable to handle the volume of traffic, so in 1933 Sir Harley Dalrymple-Hay proposed possible methods for widening the bridge without significantly affecting its appearance. The cheapest of Dalrymple-Hay's proposals, to transfer the footpaths onto stone corbels projecting from the sides of the bridge thus freeing the entire width for vehicle traffic, was rejected on aesthetic grounds, and a proposal to widen the bridge on both sides was rejected as impractical. A proposal to widen the bridge on the upstream side was settled on as causing the least disruption to nearby buildings, and in 1934 it was decided to widen the bridge by , at a cost of £73,000 (about £ in ). The Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company of Darlington was appointed to carry out the rebuilding. In 1937 each stone on the upstream side was removed and numbered and the bridge widened; the stone facing of the upstream side was then reassembled and the bridge reopened to traffic in 1940. Throughout the redevelopment, a single lane of traffic was kept open at all times. It was found that the 18th-century foundations, consisting of wooden platforms sunk into the river bed, had largely rotted away, and they were reinforced with steel pilings and concrete foundations. During the widening works the opportunity was also taken to lower slightly the roadbed at the centre of the bridge and raise the access ramps, reducing the humpbacked nature of the bridge's central section. Legacy Victorian gas lamp post on Richmond Bridge James Paine went on to design three other Thames bridges after Richmond, at Chertsey (1783), Kew (1783), and Walton (1788). Paine and Couse renewed their working relationship on the design of Chertsey Bridge, the only one of the three still in existence. Paine became High Sheriff of Surrey in 1783. In 1962, Richmond Council announced the replacement of the gaslamps on the bridge with electric lighting. The Richmond Society, a local pressure group, protested at the change to the character of the bridge, and succeeded in forcing the council to retain the Victorian gas lamp-posts, converted to electric light, which remain in place today. In the history of Richmond Bridge there have only been two reported serious collisions between boats and the bridge. On 20 March 1964, three boats tied together at Eel Pie Island, upstream, broke from their moorings in a storm and were swept downstream, colliding with the bridge. Although no serious damage was caused to the bridge, the Princess Beatrice, an 1896 steamer once used by Gilbert and Sullivan, was damaged beyond repair. On 30 January 1987, the Brave Goose, the £3,500,000 yacht of National Car Parks founder Sir Donald Gosling, became wedged under the central arch of the bridge, eventually being freed at low tide the next day. The bust of Bernardo O'Higgins near the bridge The eighth Thames bridge to be built in what is now Greater London, Richmond Bridge is currently the oldest surviving bridge over the Thames in Greater London,London Bridge (circa 55 AD), Kingston Bridge (date of construction unrecorded, but renovated in 1193 so dating from the mid-12th century at the latest), Putney Bridge (1729), Westminster Bridge (1739), Hampton Court Bridge (1752), Kew Bridge (1759), Blackfriars Bridge (1769) and Battersea Bridge (1771) predate Richmond Bridge, but have all been demolished and replaced since the construction of Richmond Bridge. and the oldest Thames bridge between the sea and Abingdon Bridge in Oxfordshire. Richmond Bridge was Grade I listed in 1952 and it is the only Georgian bridge over the Thames in London. Its bicentenary was celebrated on 7 May 1977; the commemoration was held four months after the actual anniversary of 12 January, to avoid poor weather conditions. The tradition of boat hire, repairs and boatbuilding continues at the bridge and tunnels at Richmond Bridge Boathouses under boatbuilder Mark Edwards, awarded his MBE in 2013 for \\"services to boatbuilding\\" including construction of the royal barge Gloriana. Just to the south of the bridge, in a park at the Richmond end, is a bust of the first president of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins, who studied in Richmond from 1795 until 1798. In 1998, 200 years after he left Richmond, the bust, whose sculptor is unknown, was unveiled. The patch of ground which the statue overlooks is called \\"O'Higgins Square\\". The Mayor of Richmond lays a wreath at the bust every year in the presence of staff from the Chilean Embassy in London.

Afghanistani children with fair complexion History The word \\"complexion\\" is derived from the Late Latin complexi, which initially referred in general terms to a combination of things, and later in physiological terms, to the balance of humors. The four humours were four fluids that were thought to permeate the body and influence its health. The concept was developed by ancient Greek thinkers around 400 BC and developed further by Galen.Matthew Simon, Emergent Computation: Emphasizing Bioinformatics (Springer, 2005), 145. People were thought to be either of the four temperaments: choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic, or sanguine. During the Middle Ages in Europe, the Latin term complexio served as the translated form of the Greek word crasis, meaning temperament. The term “temperament” referred to the balance of the qualities of hot, wet, cold, and dry; each human body carried a different mixture of the elements. Thus, the Scythians, who lived in a cold climate, were considered colder and moister in complexion; the Aethiopians were hotter and drier. Complexion was defined as “that quality which results from the mutual interaction and interpassion of the four contrary primary qualities residing within the elements. These elements are so minutely intermingled as each to lie in very intimate relationship to one another. Their opposite powers alternately conquer and become conquered until a quality is reached which is uniform throughout the whole: this is the complexion.”Edward Grant, A Source Book in Medieval Science (Harvard University Press, 1974), 717. As Matthew Simon writes, “Since it served as a fundamental concept, not only in physiology but also in pathology and therapy, complexion theory provided important support for the idea that medicine constituted a unified and rational body of knowledge.” By observation and judgment, medieval physicians determined the proper complexion of the individual when healthy.Paul F. Grendler, The Universities of the Italian Renaissance (JHU Press, 2002), 315. The body was healthy when all was in balance, but diagnosis was difficult, as there was no absolute measure of the right complexion, since this varied for individuals. Balance was thought to be restored by various remedies, which included bloodletting, scarifying, purging, and eating certain foods.J. N. Hays, The Burdens of Disease: Epidemics and Human Response in Western History (Rutgers University Press,1998), 85. Complexion was thought to be an indicator of one's character. The Spanish work known as Corbacho, written by Alfonso Martínez de Toledo (c. 1398—c. 1470), includes a chapter called \\"De las complexiones.\\" In it he describes the personalities of men of varying complexions: \\"There are others who are melancholic: these men correspond to the Earth, which is the fourth element, which is cold and dry. These men are very angry, without a sense of tact or moderation... They have no sense of temperance in anything they do, and only bang their head against the wall. They're very iniquitous, petulant, miserable...”Arcipreste de Talavera o Corbacho - Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes Complexion, in its original sense, engaged the attention of philosophers and musical theorists from ancient times right through to the Renaissance and beyond, in relation to the most favourable balancing of the 'qualities' or elements in order to heal and invigorate the soul: from Pythagoras and the musical theorist Aristoxenus, through Plato's dialogue Phaedo, Aristotle, Saint Augustine in his thesis on music, and Aquinas; and in the Florentine Renaissance, Marsilio Ficino in his work on the immortality of the soul, the Theologia Platonica. Thus there are many references which filter through into Shakespeare's plays and sonnets derived from this body of thought; particularly in the description of important characters, and to the power of music above all to 'charm the savage breast', adjust the elements, and restore the equilibrium and balance, the 'harmony' of the soul: his characters call for music and are spellbound or restored by it, and in elevated mood, may hear it in the air, or sense its immortal harmonies everywhere. Many surnames arose out of the existence of a complexion whose particularities may have differed from that of the village or town's population, and thus attracted enough notice to warrant a nickname. The Irish surname Rogan (from Ruadhán) referred to a person with red hair, or a ruddy complexion. The Scottish surname Bain (from bàn) referred to a fair-haired person, while Dunn (from donn) implies brown/dark hair, and Duff (from dubh) implies black hair. The English surname Brown, an extremely common surname in the English-speaking world, was originally applied to anyone with a slightly darker complexion, in the same manner that the surname White was applied to anyone with a particularly light complexion. The surname Gough is derived from the Welsh goch or coch, meaning \\"red\\" or \\"ruddy.\\" King William II of England was called William Rufus (\\"the Red\\") because of his ruddy complexion. Ludovico il Moro (\\"the Moor\\") was called as such because of his swarthy complexion. Complexion and biology A person's complexion is a biological trait. The family of biological pigments known as melanin is mainly responsible for variation in tone. Melanocytes insert granules of melanin called melanosomes into the other skin cells of the human epidermis. The melanosomes in each recipient cell accumulate atop the cellular nucleus, where they protect the nuclear DNA from mutations caused by the sun's ionizing radiation. The human body tends to protect itself against harmful surroundings. The epidermis of the body, very sensitive and delicate, reacts almost immediately to most outside effects. People whose ancestors lived for long periods in the regions of the globe near the Equator generally have more active melanocytes, and therefore larger quantities of melanin in their skins. This makes their skins very dark and protects them against high levels of exposure to the sun (it also depends on the country). In areas of the globe closer to the poles, people have far less need for protection from ionizing radiation, so their skin is usually lighter. A study published in the Journal of Human Evolution proposes that people in the Tropics have developed dark skin to block out the sun and protect their body's folate reserves. Those living away from the equator have developed a fair skin to absorb enough sunlight to maintain adequate vitamin D in their bodies.

Lyon recalls the creation of the Arctic Submarine Laboratory after the war: :\\"In 1946 when Admiral Byrd took the expedition to Antarctica, I got a letter asking if there was any research I wanted to do in conjunction with the expedition. I said yes, try a submarine in the cold water down there\\" His recommendation initiated an effort that would last over four decades.  Creation of the laboratory  In 1947, with the merger of Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory and the University of California Division of War Research into the Navy Electronics Laboratory (NEL), Dr. Lyon became head of the Submarine Studies Branch in the Research Division. A test pool was constructed at Battery Whistler (a converted mortar battery at NEL) to test equipment for deep submergence vehicles like Bathyscaphe Trieste. The pool was equipped to grow sea ice and study its physical properties. The new facility also included a field station at Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska, established in 1951. Advanced radiographic and spectrographic studies were enhanced by use of ingenious equipment at this NEL Submarine Research Facility, which possessed the only betatron on the West Coast. The Arctic Submarine Lab also included a sea ice cryostat for testing scale-model submarine sails punching up through the ice; and possessed the only betatron on the West Coast for examination into the structures of heavy objects and metals up to in diameter.  Mission and accomplishments  Equipment and techniques were designed and tested to enable submarine operation in the Arctic Ocean. Brine content and ice elasticity were measured to apply in the design of submarines that could surface through the ice cover. Cold rooms and calibration facilities at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory were used to solve the problem of icing on submarine snorkel head valves. Dr. Lyon and researcher Art Roshon developed an under-ice sonar that allowed completion of the first winter cruise by s by inverting a fathometer and putting it on top of the submarine. The research culminated in the transpolar submerged voyage of in 1958 and included scores of under-ice cruises to gain scientific knowledge essential to Arctic submarine operations. Through the 1970s and 1980s the ongoing research at the Arctic Submarine Laboratory resulted in refurbishment and improvement of the Lab's cryogenic facilities. These facilities were used for evaluating icing issues on s, sonar technology developments for remote acoustic measurement of ice thickness, and the ice breakthrough tests for s. The Lab continues today with its primary missions, developing new technology for the use of US submarines heading under the polar ice pack and providing operations staff to assist in taking submarines under the ice pack.

The screenplay is based on Jim Cartwright's 1992 play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice.  Plot  Laura Hoff, an only child, is a reclusive young woman who lives with her mother, Mari, in a working-class home in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England. She is known as LV (short for Little Voice) because of her soft, shy, and childlike speaking voice. She flees reality, hiding away in her bedroom, listening to records and mimicking the voices of artists such as Gracie Fields, Judy Garland, and Shirley Bassey; her love of songs is her only source of strength since her beloved father's death. Her mother, a promiscuous woman with countless affairs, jilts a man when her passion wanes. Billy, a telephone engineer who mends their phone, approaches LV by giving her information pamphlets. Things improve when Mari is seeing Ray; he hears the girl sing, spots her gift and vows to make her a star, while Mari, who dislikes singing, still doubts her child. Ray arranges with Mr Boo for LV to sing at his club. But her performance is understandably somewhat of a failure as she is overcome by stage fright and only manages a few lines of song. Ray sees that LV needs encouragement on stage and organises a big band, lights and a new dress to give her confidence. Ray gives her a pep talk, persuading her to perform by portraying her act as a tribute to her father. LV, therefore, agrees to sing again, but only as a one-off. When LV is to sing at a nightclub, she envisions her father to help perform well. LV brings the house down and is a storming success. Ray thinks she is his ticket to the big time and arranges for a London agent to come up and see LV perform the following night. As Ray, Mari and Mr Boo toast their future success, LV murmurs that she agreed to sing only the one time and slumps to the floor. The following night LV passively remains in her bed while selfish natures of Ray and Mari are very much revealed: Ray makes futile attempts to goad LV are dashed, while Mari, who still scorns her child, prods her against her will. At the cabaret club the London agent finally loses patience after several third-rate acts fill the time in LV's absence and leaves. Ray storms into the club and sings \\"It's Over\\" on stage, as his career disappears before everyone's eyes. Meanwhile, the faulty wiring at LV's home finally starts a fire, trapping LV in her upper room where she is rescued by Billy. In a final showdown with her mother, after being wrongly accused by her mother of arson, LV responds by screaming in her mother's face, blaming her for LV's father's death and blaming her own meek nature on Mari's domineering attitude. She walks away saying her name isn't Little Voice, it's Laura. Mari is left by everyone, Ray is facing his debt collectors, and Laura is saved by her discovery of self-confidence.

Janet Maslin wrote in her New York Times review, \\"Horrocks's phenomenal mimicry of musical grande dames from Marlene Dietrich to Marilyn Monroe, lavishing special loving care on Judy Garland, makes a splendid centerpiece for the otherwise more ordinary film built around it.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt the story was \\"amusing but uneven\\" and that the film \\"seems to have all the pieces in place for another one of those whimsical, comic British slices of life. But the movie doesn't quite deliver the way we think it will. One problem is that the Michael Caine character, sympathetic and funny in the opening and middle scenes, turns mean at the end for no good reason. Another is that the romance, and a manufactured crisis, distract from the true climax of the movie. That would be Jane Horrocks' vocal performance [...] she is amazing. Absolutely fabulous.\\"Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, 4 December 1998 Chicago Sun- Times review In Variety, Derek Elley called the film \\"a small picture with a big heart\\", adding, \\"The film has almost everything going for it, with the exceptions of a somewhat lopsided structure in which the climax comes two- thirds of the way through and a romantic subplot that plays like an afterthought. Nevertheless, smooth direction by Mark Herman and juicy performances by a host of Brit character actors [...] ensure an entertaining ride [...] Horrocks, whose combo of gamin physique and big vocal talent make the title role seem unthinkable for any other actress, is a revelation, handling moments of solo emotion and onstage strutting with equal, moving panache.\\"Variety review  Awards and nominations  * Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (Brenda Blethyn, nominee) * Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Michael Caine, winner) * Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Jane Horrocks, nominee) * Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture (Brenda Blethyn, nominee) * BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film (nominee) * BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Michael Caine, nominee) * BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Jane Horrocks, nominee) * BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Brenda Blethyn, nominee) * BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay (nominee) * BAFTA Award for Best Sound (nominee) * Satellite Award for Best Picture - Musical or Comedy (nominee) * Satellite Award for Best Adapted Screenplay (nominee) * Satellite Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Michael Caine, nominee) * Satellite Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Jane Horrocks, nominee) * Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Brenda Blethyn, nominee) * Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture (nominee) * Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role - Motion Picture (Jane Horrocks, nominee) * Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role - Motion Picture (Brenda Blethyn, nominee) * London Film Critics Circle Award for British Supporting Actor of the Year (Michael Caine, winner) * British Independent Film Award for Best Actor (Michael Caine, nominee) * British Independent Film Award for Best Actress (Jane Horrocks, nominee)  References   External links   Category:1990s musical drama films Category:1998 films Category:British films Category:English- language films Category:British drama films Category:British films based on plays Category:Films featuring a Best Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe winning performance Category:Films set in Yorkshire Category:Scarborough, North Yorkshire Category:Films produced by Elizabeth Karlsen Category:1998 drama films ","title":"Little Voice (film)"},{"id":"2193502","text":"Grete Sultan (born Johanna Margarete Sultan) (June 21, 1906June 26, 2005) was a German-American pianist. Born in Berlin into a musical Jewishhttps://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/arts/music/grete-sultan-99-a-pianist- and-mentor-to-cage-is-dead.html family, she studied piano from an early age with American pianist Richard Buhlig, and later with Leonid Kreutzer and Edwin Fischer. In 1933, after the National Socialists came to power in Germany, she was, as all Jews were, banned from playing in public and could only appear in concerts of the \\"Jüdischer Kulturbund\\" (Jewish Culture Association). With Buhlig's help, Sultan fled Germany in 1941 via Lisbon, from where she emigrated to the United States by ship. She settled in New York City and took up piano teaching, first at Vassar College and the 92nd Street Y, then at the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, New York. In the mid-1940s she met the composer John Cage and became good friends with him,Revill, 41. and it was through Sultan that Cage met one of her students, Christian Wolff, who gave Cage his first copy of the I Ching--a book that shaped Cage's composition methods during the subsequent decades. Cage dedicated two pieces to Sultan. The first was part of his Music for Piano series, Music for Piano 53-68.Revill, 185. In 1974, when Sultan was in the process of learning Cage's Music of Changes, the composer offered to write some new music for her, and the result was a monumental piano cycle, Etudes Australes.Kostelanets 2003, 91. Sultan made the premiere recording of the work and played it in concerts worldwide. She also performed the music of Alan Hovhaness and Tui St. George Tucker, but contemporary composers were not the only ones that interested her: in the 1940s she helped popularize Bach's Goldberg Variations, and her concert programs included music from Beethoven, Chopin, and Schubert to Stravinsky, Earle Brown and Morton Feldman. Grete Sultan gave her last recital in 1996, aged 90, at New York's Merkin Concert Hall, performing Bach's Goldberg Variations. She died in a Manhattan hospital five days after her 99th birthday.

For the rule to be satisfied, the short must be either at a price above the last traded price of the security, or at the last traded price when the most recent movement between traded prices was upward (i.e. the security has traded below the last-traded price more recently than above that price). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defined the rule, and summarized it: \\"Rule 10a-1(a)(1) provided that, subject to certain exceptions, a listed security may be sold short (A) at a price above the price at which the immediately preceding sale was effected (plus tick), or (B) at the last sale price if it is higher than the last different price (zero-plus tick). Short sales were not permitted on minus ticks or zero- minus ticks, subject to narrow exceptions.\\" The rule went into effect in 1938 and was removed when Rule 201 Regulation SHO became effective in 2007. In 2009, the reintroduction of the uptick rule was widely debated, and proposals for a form of its reintroduction by the SEC went into a public comment period on 2009-04-08. A modified form of the rule was adopted on 2010-02-24. United States =Origin= In 1938, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted the uptick rule, more formally known as rule 10a-1, after conducting an inquiry into the effects of concentrated short selling during the market break of 1937.SEC Interpretation: Short Sales from the SEC The original rule was implemented when Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. was SEC commissioner. In 1994, the NASD and Nasdaq adopted their own short sale price tests, known as NASD Rule 3350, based on the last bid rather than on the last reported sale. In 1978, the purpose of the uptick rule was described in a standard text \\"It was not unusual [prior to 1934] to discover groups of speculators pooling their capital and selling short for the sole purpose of driving down the stock price of a particular security to a level where the stockholders would panic and unload their fully owned shares. This, in turn, caused even greater declines in value.\\" SEC actions commencing in 2004 leading to the end of the uptick rule \\"In 2004, the Commission initiated a year-long pilot that eliminated short sale price test restrictions from approximately one-third of the largest stocks. The purpose of the pilot was to study how the removal of such short sale price test restrictions impacted the market for those subject securities. Short sale data was made publicly available during this pilot to allow the public and Commission staff to study the effects of eliminating short sale price test restrictions. Third-party researchers analyzed the publicly available data and presented their findings in a public Roundtable discussion in September 2006. The Commission staff also studied the pilot data extensively and made its findings available in draft form in September 2006, and final form in February 2007. At the time the SEC acted in 2007, two different types of price tests covered significant numbers of securities. The Nasdaq \\"bid\\" test, based on the national best bid, covered approximately 2,900 Nasdaq securities in 2005 (or 44 million short sales). The SEC's former uptick test (former Rule 10a-1), based on the last sale price, covered approximately 4,000 exchange-listed securities (or 68 million short sales).\\" Elimination of the uptick rule Effective July 3, 2007, the Commission eliminated former Rule 10a-1 and added Rule 201 of Regulation SHO, prohibiting any SRO from having a short sale price test. The SEC concluded from the study cited above: \\"The general consensus from these analyses and the roundtable was that the Commission should remove price test restrictions because they modestly reduce liquidity and do not appear necessary to prevent manipulation. In addition, the empirical evidence did not provide strong support for extending a price test to either small or thinly-traded securities not currently subject to a price test.\\" In addition, the Commission stated its belief that the amendments would bring increased uniformity to short sale regulation, level the playing field for market participants, and remove an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Commenting on the scrapping of the uptick rule, The Economist reported that \\"short-sellers argue [it] was largely symbolic, and it remains in place at only a few of the world's big stock exchanges.\\" =Calls for reinstatement= On August 27, 2007, the New York Times published an article on Muriel Siebert, former state banking superintendent of New York, \\"Wall Street veteran and financial sage\\", and, in 1967, the first woman to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange. In this article she expressed severe concerns about market volatility: \\"We've never seen volatility like this. We're watching history being made.\\" Siebert pointed to the uptick rule, saying, \\"The S.E.C. took away the short-sale rule and when the markets were falling, institutional investors just pounded stocks because they didn't need an uptick.\\" On March 28, 2008 Jim Cramer of CNBC offered the opinion that the absence of the uptick rule harms the stock market today. He claimed that reintroducing the uptick rule would help stabilize the banking sector. On July 3, 2008 Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, an adviser on mergers and acquisitions, said short-selling was at record levels and asked the SEC to take urgent action and reinstate the 70-year-old uptick rule. On November 20, 2008, they renewed their call stating \\"Decisive action cannot await ... a new S.E.C. Chairman. ... There is no tomorrow. The failure to reinstate the Uptick Rule is not acceptable.\\" On July 16, 2008, Congressman Gary Ackerman (D-NY), Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and Congressman Mike Capuano (D-MA) introduced H.R. 6517, \\"A bill to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to reinstate the uptick rule on short sales of securities.\\" To require the Securities and Exchange Commission to reinstate the uptick rule on short sales of securities. On September 18, 2008, presidential candidate and Senator John McCain (R-AZ) said that the SEC allowed short-selling to turn \\"our markets into a casino.\\" McCain criticized the SEC and its Chairman for eliminating the uptick rule. On October 6, 2008, Erik Sirri, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Trading and Markets, said that the SEC is considering bringing back the uptick rule, stating, \\"It's something we have talked about and it may be something that we in fact do.\\" On October 17, 2008, the New York Stock Exchange reported a survey with 85% of its members being in favor of reinstating the uptick rule with the dominant reason to \\"help instill market confidence\\". On November 18, 2008, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion editorial by Robert Pozen and Yaneer Bar-Yam describing an analysis of the difference between regulated and unregulated stocks during the SEC pilot program. By using an analysis they claimed to be more comprehensive than the SEC's original study, they showed that unregulated stocks have lower returns, with a difference that is both statistically and economically significant. They also reported that twice as many stocks had greater than 40% drops in corresponding 12 month periods before and after the repeal. On January 20, 2009, Ackerman received a letter from Chairman Cox—written the day he left the SEC—in which Cox said he supports the reinstatement of an uptick rule. The letter reads, \\"I have been interested in proposing an updated uptick rule. However, as you know, the SEC is a commission of five members. Throughout 2008 there was not a majority interested in reconsidering the 2007 decision to repeal the uptick rule, or in proposing some modernized variant of it. I sincerely hope that the commission, in the year ahead, continues to reassess this issue in light of the extraordinary market events of the last several months, with a view to implementing a modernized version of the uptick rule.\\" On February 25, 2009, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee stated he favored the SEC examining restoring the uptick-rule. On March 10, 2009, the SEC and Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA), Chairman of the Financial Services Committee announced plans to restore the uptick rule. Frank said he was hopeful that it would be restored within a month. 2008 Financial Crisis A paper from the New England Complex Systems Institute claims that they have found evidence that suggests the 2008 financial crisis was triggered by a \\"Bear Raid\\" market manipulation by short sellers against Citigroup late in 2007. The uptick rule was repealed in July, 2007, and the alleged bear raid took place in November, 2007. This paper has an addendum based on additional data provided by the NYSE for short sells during the time period that in fact the uptick rule would not have prevented what occurred. To quote the paper directly: > The new information we received implies that the sale of borrowed shares > reflected in the increase in borrowed shares on November 1 and the > corresponding decrease on November 7 may have been done in a way that would > not have been prevented by the uptick rule. A more detailed inquiry into the > means by which such selling could have been done is beyond the current work. Proposals for restoration of the uptick rule On April 8, 2009, the SEC voted to seek public comment on the following proposals to restore a form of the uptick rule. The SEC disclosed the 273 page text of the proposals on April 17, 2009. The comment period closed on June 19, 2009. Market-Wide, Permanent Approach: *Proposed Modified Uptick Rule: A market-wide short sale price test based on the national best bid (a proposed modified uptick rule). *Proposed Uptick Rule: A market-wide short sale price test based on the last sale price or tick (a proposed uptick rule). Security-Specific, Temporary Approach: *Circuit Breaker: A circuit breaker that would either: **Ban short selling in a particular security for the remainder of the day if there is a severe decline in price in that security (a proposed circuit breaker halt rule). **Impose a short sale price test based on the national best bid in a particular security for the remainder of the day if there is a severe decline in price in that security (a proposed circuit breaker modified uptick rule). **Impose a short sale price test based on the last sale price in a particular security for the remainder of the day if there is a severe decline in price in that security (a proposed circuit breaker uptick rule). Adoption of Alternative Uptick Rule On February 24, 2010 the SEC adopted the alternative uptick rule, by amending Rules 200(g) and 201 of Regulation SHO [17 CFR 242.200(g) and 17 CFR 242.201] under the Exchange Act. The new rule does not apply to all securities. It is triggered when a security's price decreases by 10% or more from the previous day's closing price and is effective until the close of the next day. Specifically Rule 201(b) has the following amendments: (b) (1) A trading center shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to: (i) Prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered security's closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day; and (ii) Impose the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for the remainder of the day and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and disseminated on a current and continuing basis by a plan processor pursuant to an effective national market system plan. (iii) Provided, however, that the policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to permit: (A) The execution of a displayed short sale order of a covered security by a trading center if, at the time of initial display of the short sale order, the order was at a price above the current national best bid; and (B) The execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security marked \\"short exempt\\" without regard to whether the order is at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid. Hong Kong Hong Kong traditionally had no uptick rule, a situation depicted in James Clavell's novel Noble House. They instituted one following the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Effectiveness of the rule Gordon J. Alexander and Mark A. Peterson, in an academic study of the uptick rule, found \\"the execution quality of short-sell orders is adversely affected by the Uptick Rule, even when stocks are trading in advancing markets. This is inconsistent with one of the three stated objectives of the rule, i.e., to allow relatively unrestricted short selling when a firm's stock is advancing so that the rule does not affect price discovery during such times.\\" Karl B. Diether, Kuan-Hui Lee, and Ingrid M. Werner stated in their study: \\"The results suggest that the effect of the price-tests on market quality can largely be attributed to the distortions in order flow created by the price-tests in the first place. Therefore, we believe that the price-tests can safely be permanently suspended.\\" Fisher College of Business Working Paper No. 2007-03-002; Charles A. Dice Center WP No. 2006-13. One empirical study found no statistically significant link between the uptick rule and the rates of price decline. A 2006 study by Alexander and Peterson found no substantial differences between stocks subjected to the rule and those that were not. Working Paper Series While the market experienced a brief upward trend when the rule first became effective in February 1938, it ultimately continued the broad decline that had begun in 1937—though the fact that the market suffers a short-term decline does not necessarily establish that the rule is ineffective in contributing to long- term market confidence.Uptick Rule: May Help Sustain Long-Term Recovery, but Not Likely a Short-Term Fix, Thoughtsworththinking.net, posted April 8, 2009, http://www.thoughtsworththinking.net/2009/04/uptick-rule-may-help-sustain- long-term-recovery-but-not-likely-a-short-term-fix/ References Category:United States securities law Category:Stock market ","title":"Uptick rule"},{"id":"2193537","text":"The gesture An emoji version of the gesture The OK or ring gesture (Unicode symbol U+1F44C \\"👌\\") is performed by connecting the thumb and index into a circle, and holding the other fingers straight or relaxed away from the palm. Commonly used by divers, it signifies \\"I am OK\\" or \\"Are you OK?\\" when underwater. In most English-speaking countries it denotes approval, agreement, and that all is well or \\"okay\\". In other contexts or cultures, similar gestures may have different meanings or connotations including those that are negative, offensive, financial, numerical, devotional, political, or purely linguistic. Positive connotations =Classical use= Buddha statue in Thailand depicting the gesture as Vitarka Mudrā Ring gestures, formed by forefinger and thumb with remaining digits extended, appear in Greece at least as early as the fifth century BCE, and can be seen on painted vases as an expression of love, with thumb and forefinger mimicking kissing lips. When proffered by one person toward another in Ancient Greece, the gesture was of one professing their love for another, and the sentiment was conveyed more in the touching of fingertips than in the ring that they formed. As an expression of assent and approval, the gesture can be traced back to first century Rome where the rhetorician Quintilian is recorded as having used it. Quintilian's chironomy prescribed variations in context for the gesture's use during specific points of a speech: to open, give warning or praise or accusation, and then to close a declamation. Contemporaneously the sign appeared throughout the Buddhist and Hindu diasporas as a symbol of inner perfection. Ethologist Desmond Morris posits that the joined thumb-and-forefinger communicates precision in grasping something literally or figuratively, and that the shape formed by their union represents the epitome of perfection—a circle—hence the gesture's transcultural message that things are \\"exactly right\\" or \\"perfect\\". In Naples the gesture has been long used to symbolize love and matrimony, as was custom in neighboring Greece, but specifically with the palm upturned, while the gesture made with a downturned palm represents a hand holding the scales of justice. Across Italy the gesture remained in use as one for making points in conversation when moved about to express discursive precision, but when held still in an upright position with fingers jutting skyward, it became an emblem of perfection. Early records of the sign's usage in the English-speaking world date to British physician- philosopher John Bulwer's 1644 Chirologia, \\"The naturall language of the hand composed of the speaking motions, and discoursing gestures thereof.\\" Among the many hand gestures detailed by Bulwer, he described one as \\"The top of the fore-finger moved to joyne with the naile of the Thumbe that's next to it, the other fingers in remitter,\\" and said that it was \\"opportune for those who relate, distinguish, or approve\\". =\\"OK\\"= Caricature of Uncle Sam making the \\"OK\\" gesture in a cartoon for the 1900 Paris Exposition By the early 19th century in the United States, the gesture was affiliated with the letters \\"O\\" (formed by the circle) and \\"K\\" (derived from the extended fingers). While it is not known exactly how the OK gesture and the corresponding verbal expression coalesced, the English professor Allen Walker Read dates the expression's rise in usage to an 1839 humor piece in the Boston Morning Post describing the expression \\"o.k.\\" as meaning \\"all correct\\", suggesting comically misspelled initials, at a time when acronyms for misspelled words were in vogue. Several other broadsheets in Boston, New York and Philadelphia ran with the expression in their own columns, some with misspellings of \\"all correct\\" such as oll korrect, bringing the phrase into the vernacular of American English. The following year Democrats took to using the phrase and its accompanying gesture in support of president Martin Van Buren's campaign for reelection. A native of Kinderhook, New York, Van Buren was widely known by his nickname, \\"Old Kinderhook\\", whose initials, \\"O.K.\\", were steadily gaining traction as an expression of approval. In New York City, fans of Van Buren formed the O.K. Democratic Club and used the gesture as its sign, with the slogan of \\"O.K.\\" bearing the double meaning in the club's catchphrase, \\"Old Kinderhook is all correct.\\" Both phrase and gesture made their way into newspapers around the country via political cartoons, thus further spreading the expression. After Van Buren's defeat to William Henry Harrison, O.K. was briefly satirized as meaning \\"Ofrul Kalamity\\" or \\"Orful Katastrophe\\". Despite Van Buren's loss and the subsequent dissolution of the O.K. Democratic Club, the gesture has since been widely used since to mean \\"all is well\\" or \\"good\\" in the United States. As a gesture, its connotation is more positive than the word \\"OK\\", which may mean a thing is merely mediocre, satisfactory at only the most basic level, as in, \\"The food was OK.\\" The gesture is commonly understood as a signal of approval, and is sometimes used synonymously with the Western \\"thumbs up\\" gesture. =Scuba diving= Diver's signal meaning \\"Everything OK,\\" used both as a question and as a response to that question. In the communication used by scuba divers, the OK sign is specific in its meaning that \\"everything is OK\\" as regulated by the Recreational Scuba Training Council. Divers are taught to always use this sign and not the thumbs up gesture because the latter means that a diver needs to ascend. The gesture is also used as a means of checking in, with one diver using it to ask another, \\"Everything OK?\\" and the response meaning, \\"Yes, everything is OK.\\" At distances where the standard OK gesture may be hard to see, divers use larger signals as an alternative, either with one hand atop the head and the elbow bent out to the side, or with both hands touching above the head so that the arms form an \\"O\\" for \\"OK\\". This full-body gesture is also used as \\"OK\\" in Japan where the single-handed gesture connotes monetary transactions instead of meaning \\"OK\\". This two-armed OK gesture was added to Unicode in 2010 under the name \\"Face With OK Gesture\\" (U+1F646 \\"🙆\\") and became part of Emoji 1.0 in 2015. =Money= Illustration from an 1880s account of gestures used in Mexico. In Japan, the one-handed ring gesture is used to symbolize money, and in this context the fingers' circular shape represents a coin. Sometimes the sign is used to avoid the verbal awkwardness in talking about or asking for money. In other contexts, it can be used to imply a bribe or other illicit financial transactions, or signal an invitation to enter into business negotiations. In other parts of the world the gesture can also express money, financial transactions, wealth or the priciness of an item. Records of the gesture being used to remark on a person's wealth or status are documented as practiced in Mexico during the late nineteenth century. =Mudra= Vitarka mudra, Tarim Basin, 9th century In yoga the gesture is known as chin mudra (\\"the seal of consciousness\\") when the palm is face down, or jnana mudra (\\"the seal of wisdom\\") when the palm is face up or held in other positions, such as in front of the heart. Some schools of yoga use chin and jnana mudra interchangeably, while others claim that \\"the former produces a subtle feeling of rootedness, the latter a sense of lightness,\\" or that jnana \\"the passive receiving position\\" while chin \\"is an actively giving position\\". In these mudras the middle, ring, and little fingers represent the three gunas of rajas, tamas, and sattva which, when in harmony, unite ātman and brahman, or the individual soul and universal soul. The pressing together of the thumb and forefinger represents that union—or \\"yoga\\"—of consciousness. In Buddhism the gesture is called vitarka mudra (\\"the seal of discussion\\") and is used to emphasize the meaning of words. Negative connotations =Cultural contexts= In countries such as France where the \\"OK\\" gesture bears both positive and negative connotations, facial expression helps contextualize its meaning. While widespread use of the OK gesture has granted it an international connotation of assent, it also bears negative, vulgar, or offensive meanings in many regions of the world.Dangerous Body Language Abroad, by Matthew Link. Posted 26 July, 2010 01:00 PM. Retrieved on 26 July 2017 In contrast to Japan's use of the expression to represent coins and wealth, the gesture's \\"O\\" shape stands for \\"zero\\" meaning \\"worth nothing\\" in France and Tunisia. In many Mediterranean countries such as Turkey, Tunisia, and Greece, as well as in the Middle East, parts of Germany, and many parts of Latin America, the gesture may be interpreted as a vulgar expression resembling a human anus, referring to sex, either as an insult (\\"You are an asshole\\"), or a homophobic reaction to a symbol of homosexuality and the act of sodomy. In Brazil it can be synonymous with giving someone the middle finger. In Kuwait and other parts of the Arab world, this sign represents the evil eye and is used as a curse, sometimes in conjunction with verbal condemnation.. GlobalSecurity.org In some regions of the world, both the positive \\"OK\\" and the negative forms are practiced, which can lead to confusion over which meaning is intended. In regions and cultures where the gesture has a historically negative connotation, its use as an \\"OK sign\\" is often the result of its appearance in media and tends to be used more by younger people. In France, where widespread use has seeped in through American culture, the gesture's positive \\"OK\\" sentiment became popular in the north of the country while its negative connotation as \\"worthless\\" remained in the south. To avoid confusion, French communicators have become accustomed to using additional context clues, such as posture or facial expression, to clarify meaning. In other circumstances, the gesture's varied meanings are less easily reconciled, as was the case in 1950s Brazil when United States Vice President Richard Nixon emerged from his airplane displaying the sign with each hand. While Nixon's intent was to communicate good will to the people of São Paulo, the crowd received it with offense. =The circle game= \\"The circle\\" positioned below the waistline as it appears in the circle game. Since the 1970s, the OK gesture has been the key feature of the popular school prank, \\"the circle game\\". A person initiating the game makes the gesture palm- inward below their own waistline and tries to trick an opponent into looking at it. If the person looks at it, the maker of the gesture punches the opponent in the arm. Variations exist where a player who can insert their own index finger into the circle without looking at it may punch the circle-maker. In November 2000, the gesture gained widespread use when the circle game was a plot feature in an episode of the sitcom Malcolm in the Middle. In a much earlier version (1950s), the circle was placed over the maker's elbow, or any body part. = White power symbol= In 2017, users on the message-board site 4chan aimed to convince the media and left-leaning people that the OK gesture was being used as a white power symbol. According to The Boston Globe, users on 4chan's /pol/ (\\"Politically Incorrect\\") board were instructed in February 2017 to \\"flood Twitter and other social media websites...claiming that the OK hand sign is a symbol of white supremacy,\\" as part of a campaign dubbed \\"Operation O-KKK\\".The association of the gesture with white supremacy derived from the assertion that the three upheld fingers resemble a 'W' and the circle made with the thumb and forefinger resemble the head of a 'P', together standing for \\"White Power.\\" While some members of the alt-right used the symbol after the launch of the 4chan campaign, it initially remained ambiguous whether or not it was being used to communicate genuine adherence to white supremacy, or with deliberately ironic motives. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) wrote in May 2017: In September 2019 the ADL changed its position, adding the OK gesture to its \\"Hate on Display\\" database. According to the ADL, by 2019 some white supremacists had begun using the OK symbol \\"as a sincere expression of White Supremacy\\", and many white supremacists have acknowledged using the symbol as a gesture of White Power. A number of people have been accused of genuine use of the sign in support for white-supremacist ideology: Sign language Most sign languages combine hand shapes, movement, and position in relation to the rest of body, as well as additional body language and facial expression. As with other hand signs, the OK gesture may be combined with other elements to convey numerous meanings across multiple sign languages. =Monastic signing= Dating back to the tenth century in Europe, the gesture of thumb and forefinger forming a ring with the remaining fingers extended was used in a set of standardized ecclesiastical signs employed by Christian monks under vows of silence to represent numerous religious rites and objects. For example, when held out in front of oneself the gesture represented an oblation to God. When touched to the mouth it meant taking a meal. When added to the open-palmed sign for 'book' it specified a hymnal, and the sign's O-shape represented the signing of an 'O' that began many hymns. If the thumb and forefinger took hold of a specific part of one's own clothing or body such as the hood of a cowl, a lock of hair, or skin on the left hand, the gesture could stand for things as diverse as 'monk' or 'horse' or 'parchment'. =Plains Indian Sign Language= An 1880 drawing of a person displaying the sign for 'Sun' in Plains Indian Sign Language In North American Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL), the gesture signifies the Sun when held up in front of the face or moved in an arc following the Sun's track. When held up to the sky and peered through, it is the sign for high noon. A PISL primer printed in an 1888 issue of the Canadian residential school newspaper Our Forest Children specifies that the left hand be used to indicate sunrise and the right for sunset. A more complicated series of movements with hands held in the gesture as if drawing a thread or stretching an elastic can signify death, or more specifically, 'After a long time, you die.' =American Sign Language= In modern-day American Sign Language (ASL) the gesture can mean many different things depending on how it is applied. The pinching action of the thumb-and- forefinger frequently represents something small. For example, the sign for 'housefly' is made by making the gesture mimic a fly buzzing around. In ASL the gesture can also communicate a selection of some sort: When moved from one side to the other as if picking something up and placing it down, it means 'appoint'. When the joined thumb and forefinger of the gesture are placed into a hole made by the opposite hand, it means 'vote'. The sign for 'elect' is formed by making the signs for 'vote' and 'appoint' in succession. =Fingerspelling= The letter F in the American manual alphabet In deaf culture, the sign of joined thumb and forefinger takes on various letters in different systems of fingerspelling. The American manual alphabet reserves it for the letter F, while in both Irish and French Sign Language it is the letter G. In fingerspellings that represent Cyrillic alphabetical systems, such as the Ukrainian manual alphabet, the gesture represents the vowel O and reflects that letter's shape. Similarly, the Korean manual alphabet uses the gesture for the Hangul letter \\"ㅇ\\", romanized as \\"ng\\" to reflect its pronunciation in spoken Korean. In yubimoji (指文字 ), Japan's manual syllabary whose 45 signs and four diacritics represent the phonemes of the Japanese language, the gesture is the syllable \\"me\\" (め in hiragana, メ in katakana). Various fingerspelling systems may call for other specific features of the gesture beyond its joined thumb-and-forefinger with remaining fingers entended. For example, the ring in yubimoji's \\"me\\" gesture is slightly tapered rather than rounded. be seeing you! =Counting= In American Sign Language the OK gesture represents the number 9 when held in a stationary position with the palm facing away from the signer. This ASL numerical sign is the last in a sequence of single-digit integers where quantities of fingers denote the numbers 1 through 5, and then the thumb touches each finger in turn to denote '6' (pinky finger), '7' (ring finger), '8' (middle finger), and finally '9' (index finger). When shaken from left to right, the sign for the number 9 becomes the number 19. In Plains Indian Sign Language, the gesture signifies the number 3 when held a bit lower than the signs used to represent the sun. Regional forms of finger counting used in China also employ the raised middle, ring and pinky fingers to express the number 3, either with thumb and index fingers joined as they are in the OK gesture or in a similar configuration. This number gesture is primarily used in China's southern provinces, while in the north, '3' may also be expressed by the raised index, middle, and ring fingers as it is in English-speaking countries. Both methods are distinct from having the thumb, index and middle fingers extended as is used to denote '3' in much of mainland Europe, because this represents the number 8 in both Taiwan and parts of mainland China. Greco-Roman chironomia also included a counting system in which the ring gesture stood for either '10', '30', '100', or '300', the exact number being determined by which hand was used and the exact point of contact between thumb and forefinger. Popular culture =The Prisoner= The gesture was given prominence in the 1967 British television series The Prisoner, in which a number of unnamed characters are held captive in a village. Whenever these imprisoned villagers took leave of each other, they did so with the phrase \\"Be seeing you\\", accompanied by the gesture held up in front of their own eye as a reminder that despite any pretenses of freedom, they were all prisoners. The gesture is also used as a greeting in the show without the \\"be seeing you\\" phrase. The series' lead actor Patrick McGoohan stated that the show had adopted the gesture from the sign of the fish used by early Christians. =As a film title= In 2010, South Indian film director Upendra Rao made a cinematic comeback with a film that fans called Super, but whose actual title was 👌. Rao himself starred in his film as a non-resident Indian who returns to his homeland to turn the nation into a utopian society. In depicting the film's title only as a hand symbol, Rao's intent was for the audience to name it, thinking that they might call it \\"Zero\\" or \\"Three\\", or associate it with Vitarka Mudra or the symbol for om (ॐ). During the film's opening credit sequence, the Vitarka Mudra title transforms into a hand pointing at the viewer announcing the name of the director as \\"U\\". Other connotations =Political affiliations= The United Macedonia Salute, mirroring the Vergina Sun flag in the background In Europe's Balkan region, the OK gesture is known as the \\"United Macedonia Salute\\" in its association with irredentist campaigns for a united Macedonia. For Macedonian nationalists the two fingers forming the \\"O\\" stand for the Macedonian word Обединета (Obedineta, meaning \\"United\\"), and the other three fingers symbolize the regions of Aegean Macedonia in northern Greece, Pirin Macedonia in southwestern Bulgaria, and the region of Vardar Macedonia that roughly corresponds to the Republic of North Macedonia's borders. Taken together, the United Macedonia Salute also resembles the Vergina Sun that was the royal symbol of Ancient Macedonia. Both sun and salute became popular among Macedonian Greeks in the 1980s, and the sun appeared on the Macedonian flag after the Republic of Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. Three years later Macedonia changed its flag under economic pressure from Greece, which saw the use of the Vergina Sun as a threat against Greek sovereignty. The United Macedonia Salute remains controversial among many people in the Balkan region, especially those living within parts of Greece or Bulgaria that Macedonian nationalists wish to claim as provinces for their country. =Medical testing= The gesture is used by doctors to test functionality of the anterior interosseous nerve and seek indications of median nerve palsy in the hands. When performing the test, a patient makes the OK gesture with both hands. If the circle formed by one hand appears more pinched or less round than the other, it may indicate weakness in the nerve. A similar medical test, known as Froment's sign, is used to test for palsy on the ulnar nerve. To perform the test, a patient holds a piece of paper between their forefinger and thumb, and the examiner attempts to pull it out of the patient's grip.Jeff G. Konin et al. Special Tests for Orthopedic Examination: Third Edition. Thorofare, NJ. SLACK Incorporated, 2006. If ulnar nerve palsy is present, the patient will have difficulty maintaining their hold and may compensate by flexing the thumb to add more pressure.Richardson, Craig and Fabre, Gerd. '\\"Froment's Sign.\\" Journal of Audiovisual Media in Medicine. Vol. 26, No. 1 (2003):34. =Corporate logos= The gesture has been used as a design element in several corporate and organizational logos. These include the Piramal Group, Bharat Petroleum, and Adlabs Studios, all headquartered in India. Piramal Group CEO Ajay Piramal told the press that \\"The Group's values are rooted in tradition. They have been derived from three guiding principles in the Bhagavad Gita: Gyan Yoga (the principle of knowledge and learning), Karma Yoga (the principle of dynamic action and entrepreneurial spirit) and Bhakti Yoga (the principle of care, compassion and devotion to a higher purpose).\\" Piramal stated that the three fingers in the logo symbolize the mind, the body and the intellect in alignment with the Group's core values of \\"Knowledge, Action and Care\\" that subtitle the corporation's logo. In contrast to this, Bharat Petroleum began using the OK gesture as its own logo in 2002 with its \\"Pure for Sure\\" initiative to indicate that petrol filling stations and trucks transporting gasoline had been audited and approved as selling pure, undiluted fuel, and that customers could trust that what they were buying had been \\"okayed\\".

It is a freeform radio station staffed entirely by UMD students and volunteers.  Broadcast Coverage  WMUC can be heard on 88.1 FM in parts of Washington, DC, Silver Spring, College Park, Hyattsville and many of the surrounding communities. It is also streamed on the internet at wmuc.umd.edu and through the WMUC Radio app.  History  WMUC had its first beginning in 1942 when student-run Old Line Network began daily broadcasts. Gilbert Cullen, with the help of George Reynolds, built the first University of Maryland campus radio station. Broadcasts were limited to the campus, so the station did not require an FCC license to operate. This became the fifth student-run campus station on the east coast. However, the station shut down January 1943 when most of its technical personnel were enlisted in the armed forces. The station re-launched in January using the call letters WMUC. The first WMUC broadcast aired October 11, 1948, but was shut down three days later due to transmission issues. The station relocated from the Speech Department to Silvester Hall in spring 1950, but in the fall, relocated again to a renovated shower stall in Calvert Hall where it remained until 1953. In 1953, WMUC moved to the old Journalism building (better known as Temporary Building FF) in a low-lying area of campus called \\"the gulch,\\" where it stayed for over 20 years. Finally, the station relocated to the third floor of South Campus Dining Hall in fall 1974, where it currently resides. WMUC received its FM license in 1979 after a two-year \\"FM or Bust\\" campaign, airing as a 10-watt FM station for the first time on September 10, 1979. It adopted the freeform format in 1982 so DJs could promote underground artists and music that is underrepresented by commercial radio. The WMUC-AM 650 remained Top-40 format. WMUC (AM) gained credibility in the Washington, D.C. radio broadcasting job market, providing announcers and managerial talent to many local stations. Though primarily funded by student fees, it also generated revenue through advertising of local and national concerns. In this era, WMUC \\"acquired its first news network affiliation, saw Anne Edwards appointed as the first female station manager and, in 1965, was selected by the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System to receive the \\"All-American College Radio Station\\" Award. In the mid 70s, programming broadened to include shows aimed at black and minority students and promoting feminism. Waning listenership and increasing maintenance of the campus-only carrier-current system caused the shutdown of AM in 1999. In its place, the online service WMUC Digital was created. In 2012, the University Libraries' establishment of the Digital Conversion and Media Reformatting Center (DCMR) facilitated the process of archiving and digitizing the station schedules, staff lists, policies, forms, flyers, zines, photos, awards, correspondence, reports, newspaper clippings, and manuals. The WMUC Collection is now a \\"permanent and growing part of the University Archives\\" and is available for public research. \\"Saving College Radio: WMUC Past, Present, and Future\\" was exhibited in Hornbake Library from September 2013 to July 2014. Programming WMUC-FM is true freeform radio, where the DJs themselves determine the programming of the station. An elected student Program Director assigns weekly time slots on the station to individual DJs, who are then responsible for programming, hosting, and promoting their respective shows. The schedule changes each semester, with the goal of offering a fresh perspective and diverse lineup of music and talk shows created by students at the University of Maryland. In 2008, WMUC launched WMUC-2, a separate internet-only radio station which, like WMUC-FM, features freeform music and talk programming. Intended as a \\"proving ground\\" for new DJs, WMUC-2 also features programs which may not be appropriate for broadcast under FCC rules. WMUC also has an active Sports department, which maintains its own website and internet stream at wmucsports.net. WMUC Sports features a regular schedule of talk radio shows as well as on-air play-by-play and color analysis of Maryland sporting events. Calling 10 different sports, WMUC Sports is the primary carrier of Maryland men's soccer, women's basketball, baseball, women's lacrosse, field hockey, and softball. In the past, WMUC had an active News department, which was integrated with the former Radio Television and Film department at the University of Maryland. WMUC's news programming is now student run. The programming is divided into two segments: Weekly Roundup, the flagship news show featuring original reporting on top campus, national and DMV area news; and Drop the Pop, the featured talk show covering all things pop culture, politics, entertainment and more. =Live music= WMUC has a weekly live music program called Third Rail Radio (named after the electrically charged third rail of the DC Metro system), started in 1996 by Eric Speck.

This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece. Agon is the word-forming element in 'agony', explaining the concept of agon(y) in tragedy by its fundamental characters, the protagonist and antagonist.  Athletics  In one sense, agon meant a contest or a competition in athletics, for example, the Olympic Games (Ὀλυμπιακοὶ Ἀγῶνες). Agon was also a mythological personification of the contests listed above. This god was represented in a statue at Olympia with halteres (dumbbells) () in his hands. This statue was a work of Dionysius, and dedicated by Micythus of Rhegium.Pausanias, Description of Greece, book V (Elis), v. 26. § 3  Religion  Agon also referred to a challenge that was held in connection with religious festivals.Trapido (1949) With a further religious meaning as used in 1 Timothy 6:12 in the New Testament and defined by Strong's Concordance as, agón: a gathering, contest, struggle; as an (athletic) contest; hence, a struggle (in the soul).Strong's Concordance  Theater  In Ancient Greek drama, particularly Old Comedy (fifth century B.C.), agon refers to a contest or debate between two characters - the protagonist and the antagonist - in the highly structured Classical tragedies and dramas. The agon could also develop between an actor and the choir or between two actors with half of the chorus supporting each. Through the argument of opposing principles, the agon in these performances resembled the dialectic dialogues of Plato.[\\"agon.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. 17 February 2014.] The meaning of the term has escaped the circumscriptions of its classical origins to signify, more generally, the conflict on which a literary work turns. Dance In 1948, Lincoln Kirstein posed the idea of a ballet that would later become known as Agon. After ten years of work before Agon's premiere, it became the final ballet in a series of collaborations between choreographer George Balanchine and composer Igor Stravinsky. Balanchine referred to this ballet as \\"the most perfect work\\" to come out of the collaboration between Stravinsky and himself.  Literature  Harold Bloom in The Western Canon uses the term agon to refer to the attempt by a writer to resolve an intellectual conflict between his ideas and the ideas of an influential predecessor in which \\"the larger swallows the smaller\\", such as in chapter 18, Joyce's agon with Shakespeare. In \\"Man, Play, and Games\\" Roger Caillois uses the term Agon to define games of competitive nature.  Sociopolitical theory  In sociopolitical theory, agon can refer to the idea that the clash of opposing forces necessarily results in growth and progress.Colaguori 2012  Derivatives  Words derived from agon include agony, agonism, antagonism, and protagonist.

His work was highly distinctive, wearing its design influences on its sleeve, daring to be two- dimensional and bold in its use of large expanses of flat, bold colours. This stood out particularly during the early 1990s, when British comics were leaning ever more towards fully painted art. Unusually, Hughes preferred to be his own letterer, and designed several unusual fonts for this purpose. Since leaving comics illustration, Hughes has become a successful advertising artist, graphic designer and font designer. He runs his own company, Device, with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin Books, DC Comics, Eurostar the BBC and a range of magazines and newspapers. Hughes prefers to design his own fonts for new projects usually giving them humorous and occasionally rude names. The font Knobcheese was marketed as \\"A typeface in the Swiss (cheese) tradition. With knobs on.\\" Biography =Early days= Hughes graduated from London College of Printing and was employed at various advertising agencies where he worked for ID magazine, Smash Hits and Condé Nast. He arrived late at his very first job interview at an advertising agency with a lump of dog excrement stuck to the bottom of his portfolio, managed to transfer some of it on to the white shirt he was wearing and the rest onto the meeting-room table. Directors had to open windows to let the stench out. Despite this, he got the job. At the same time he was drawing his own comics, released as small press minicomics in editions of around 20 copies. Three issues of Zit were published between 1983 and 1984 and through these he got involved with the British small press comics scene of the time based around the Fast Fiction stall Paul Gravett was running at the Westminster Comic Mart in London. Hughes was a regular contributor to Gravett's Escape from 1983 to 1989 with strips including Norm and The Inheritors. In 1987 his first graphic novel, The Science Service, co-written with John Freeman, was published by Belgian publishers Magic Strip in seven languages. The UK edition was co- published in 1989 by Acme Press in the UK and Eclipse Comics in the US. =Design and logo design= From the mid-1980s through to the present day, Hughes has been involved with design work for a wide range of comics publishers. He is responsible for the distinctive look of the Knockabout Books line of collected underground comics and periodicals from 1985 to 1992. By the early 1990s it seemed like every aspect of the British comics industry had Hughes' stamp on it, from the carrier bags at Forbidden Planet to the logo of Mega City Comics. In 1990 the strip Dare was drawn by Hughes, serialised in Revolver, a magazine he designed, and written about in Speakeasy, a news magazine he'd also redesigned. At Fleetway he did influential work, designing a new display font for their weekly comic 2000 AD, under the supervision of innovative Art Director Steve Cook. When the adult comic Crisis was launched it featured a radical Hughes design and he continued to spearhead Fleetways identity with the launch of Revolver and their graphic novels line. For Titan Books he was given the task of designing books that repackaged American comics for the UK market. Most notable was his work on Love and Rockets, a personal favourite of Hughes. His design was considered daring but the American publisher, Fantagraphics Books, was impressed and used similar concepts in their own collections. For DC Comics Hughes has designed numerous logos and covers, initially for the Vertigo imprint where many British creators were working. Here he continued his collaboration with Grant Morrison, creating covers and identity for The Invisibles. He has also worked on covers for DC's superhero lines, notably the Tangent series of Elseworlds comics. Other notable design work for the comics industry includes the 1986 MTV Europe Awards booklet Outbreaks of Violets, possibly the rarest Alan Moore title, late-era issues of Deadline where he worked on the entire magazine on a minimal budget in three days, and the retro covers for Flex Mentallo produced with artist Frank Quitely. Hughes design output has broadened into work for clients in the music industry, advertising, toy industry and publishing. Hughes recently completed artwork for Oxford based rock group The Winchell Riots, designing the vinyl and CD sleeves for their 'Red Square EP' which was released September 2010. =Illustration= Example of Rian Hughes' illustration Hughes' discovery of the Mac in 1993 pushed his illustration work in a more stylised graphic direction. Adopting first Freehand than Adobe Illustrator, he used expanses of flat colour and texture in asymmetric and dynamic layouts, his characters became more elegant and exaggerated, and the type, generally custom designed for each illustration, became an integral part of his imagemaking process. This very influential flat vector style has been dubbed \\"Sans Ligne\\" in reference to the European \\"Ligne Claire\\" school by artist Will Kane. Though enabled by the Macintosh, Hughes' considers his combination of design, illustration and typography to be a return to the working methods of the poster artists of the early 20th century, a period when artists like the Stenberg Brothers, Cassandre and Jean Carlu combined type, image and layout to achieve a dynamic, integrated whole. Hughes illustration work includes title sequences for The Box, poster designs for Tokyo fashion company Jun Co.'s Yellow Boots chain, the animated on-board safety film for Virgin Atlantic, Eurostar's poster campaign, a collection of Hawaiian shirts, a range for Swatch and the BBC's CD edition of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. In 2007 he collaborated with ex Spice Girl Geri Halliwell on a series of six children's books, Ugenia Lavender. Now widely copied, the influence of Hughes' illustration style can be seen in advertising, on covers for mass-market women's paperbacks, children's books and editorial illustrations worldwide. =Type design= Selection of fonts designed by Hughes and released through his Device foundry Hughes' has described typography as \\"the particle physics of design\\". Hughes' interest in letterforms began at an unusually young age thanks to a Letraset catalogue his architect father had lying about the studio. At 15 he visited Letraset, where he saw Rubylith being used for the first time to create type. This is the technique he used in the early days of his career when producing custom type for his design work. Early fonts like FF CrashBangWallop and FF Revolver (originally designed for Speakeasy and Revolver magazine respectively) were digitisations of fonts originally done in this old-fashioned method of Rubylith on board. His first fonts were released back in 1992 as part of the FontFont range, while subsequent designs have been released via his own foundry, Device Fonts. Many of Hughes' fonts were created for specific design commissions, and their names reflect their application or the circumstances of their conception. The chunky no-nonsense Judgement family was commissioned for 2000 AD, home of Judge Dredd. Metropol Noir, which was created specifically for the BDA Gold Award winning 1996 MTV Europe Music Awards programme is named after the Paris hotel Hughes was put up in for the event. Others are more descriptive; FF Knobcheese suggests a knobbly Swiss Cheese; Foonky and Laydeez Night derive from a kitsch 70s aesthetic. A retrospective catalogue \\"Ten Year Itch\\" was published in 2005 and features all Hughes' type designs up to that point.

His accession was engineered by his brother-in-law, the vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, who was the de facto ruler of the state throughout his reign. Al-Musta'li's accession sidelined his oldest brother, Nizar, who in response rose in revolt, was defeated and executed. This caused a major split in the Isma'ili movement, with the Nizaris splitting off from the Fatimid-backed Musta'lis. During al-Musta'li's reign, the First Crusade arrived in the Levant, leading to the loss of Jerusalem and a major Fatimid defeat at the Battle of Ascalon. Life The future al- Musta'li was born on 16 September 1074 to the eighth Fatimid caliph, al- Mustansir Billah, and was most likely the youngest of all of al-Mustansir's sons. =Disputed succession= Ahmad's oldest brother, Nizar ibn al- Mustansir, was apparently considered as the most likely successor to his father, as was the custom; indeed Nizar is often stated to have been the designated (naṣṣ) successor of his father. However, no definite designation of Nizar as heir seems to have taken place by the time of al-Mustansir's death, and the powerful vizier, Badr al-Jamali, and his son and heir al-Afdal Shahanshah, favoured the accession of Ahmad. Shortly before his death, al- Mustansir consented to the wedding of Ahmad with Badr's daughter Sitt al-Mulk. The later Musta'li tradition maintains that at the wedding banquet, Ahmad was designated as heir by al-Mustansir, while a medieval source claims that on his deathbed, al-Mustansir had chosen him as heir, and that a sister of al- Mustansir's is said to have been called to him privately and received Ahmad's nomination as a bequest. Modern historians, such as Farhad Daftary, believe that these stories are most likely attempts to justify and retroactively legitimize Ahmad's accession, which they view as a de facto coup d'etat by al- Afdal. According to this view, al-Afdal chose his brother-in-law because his own position was still insecure, as he had but recently succeeded his father Badr. Ahmad, who was tied to him by virtue of his marriage and completely dependent on him for his accession, would be a compliant figurehead who was unlikely to threaten al-Afdal's as yet fragile hold on power by attempting to appoint another to the vizierate. According to al-Maqrizi, after al-Mustansir died on 29 December 1094, al-Afdal summoned three of al-Mustansir's sons—Nizar, Abdallah, and Isma'il, apparently the most prominent among the caliph's progeny—to the palace to do homage to al-Musta'li, who had been seated on the throne. All three refused, each claiming that he had been designated as successor by their father. This refusal apparently took al-Afdal completely by surprise, and the brothers were even allowed to leave the palace; but while Abdallah and Isma'il made for a nearby mosque, Nizar immediately fled Cairo. To add to the confusion, when learning of al- Mustansir's passing, Baraqat, the chief missionary (dāʿı̄) of Cairo (the head of the Isma'ili religious establishment) proclaimed Abdallah as caliph with the regnal name al-Muwaffaq. Soon, however, al-Afdal regained control: Baraqat was arrested (and later executed), Abdallah and Isma'il were placed under surveillance and eventually acknowledged al-Musta'li, and a grand assembly of officials held, which acclaimed al-Musta'li as imam and caliph. =Nizar's revolt and the Nizari schism= Nizar, in the meantime, fled to Alexandria, where he gained the support of the local governor and populace, and proclaimed himself imam and caliph with the title of al-Mustafa li-Din Allah (\\"the Chosen One for God's Religion\\"). Nizar's partisans repulsed al-Afdal's first attempt to seize Alexandria, and Nizar's forces raided up to the outskirts of Cairo. Over the next months, however, al-Afdal managed to win back the allegiance of the Arab tribes with bribes and gifts. Weakened, Nizar's forces were pushed back to Alexandria, which was placed under siege, until Nizar and his remaining followers were forced to surrender. They were taken back to Cairo, where Nizar was immured. These events caused a bitter and permanent schism in the Isma'ili movement, that lasts to this day. While al-Musta'li was recognized by the Fatimid establishment and the official Isma'ili daʿwa, as well as the Isma'ili communities dependent on it in Syria and Yemen, most of the Isma'ili communities in the wider Middle East, and especially Persia and Iraq, rejected it. Under the leadership of Hassan-i Sabbah, whether out of conviction or as a convenient excuse, the Isma'ilis in Persia swiftly recognized Nizar's rights to the imamate, severed relations with Cairo, and set up their own independent daʿwa (the daʿwa jadīda, \\"new calling\\"). This marked the permanent split of the Isma'ili movement into the rival Musta'li and Nizari branches. At least one Nizar's sons, al-Husayn, fled in 1095 with other members of the dynasty (including three of al-Mustansir's other sons, Muhammad, Isma'il, and Tahir) from Egypt to the Maghreb, where they formed a sort of opposition in exile to the new regime in Cairo. As late as 1162, descendants, or purported descendants, of Nizar appeared to challenge the Fatimid caliphs, and were able to attract considerable followings based on lingering loyalist sentiments of the population. =Reign= By and large, throughout his reign al-Musta'li was subordinate to al-Afdal. Al-Afdal was a capable administrator, and his good governance ensured the continued prosperity of Egypt throughout the reign. Al-Musta'li himself is praised for his upright character by the Sunni contemporary historian Ibn al-Qalanisi, while other medieval historians stress his fanatical devotion to Shi'ism; it appears that the Isma'ili propaganda network (the daʿwa) was very active during his reign. The 15th-century Yemeni Musta'li leader and historian Idris Imad al-Din preserves much information about his dealings with the Isma'ili daʿwa in Yemen, particularly with the Sulayhid queen Arwa al-Sulayhi and the local dāʿı̄, Yahya ibn Lamak ibn Malik al-Hammadi. In foreign affairs, the reign began well, with the voluntary submission of Apamea in northern Syria in 1096, followed by the recovery of Tyre in 1097. However, a proposal for an alliance with the Seljuk ruler of Aleppo, Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan, against Duqaq, the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, failed. In the same year, 1097, the First Crusade entered Syria, and al-Afdal sent an embassy to make contact with them. The Fatimids used the distraction of the Crusade to recover control of Jerusalem from its Artuqid rulers in July/August 1098. Al-Afdal did not expect the Crusaders to march south, and was caught by surprise when they moved against Jerusalem in 1099. The city was captured after a siege, and the subsequent defeat of a Fatimid army at the Battle of Ascalon on 5 August 1099 confirmed the new status quo. As a result of the Crusader advance, many Syrians fled to Egypt, where a famine broke out in 1099 or 1100 as a result. Al-Musta'li died on 12 December 1102, and was succeeded by his son al-Mansur, with the regnal name al-Amir bi-Ahkam Allah.

The relationship between regional hegemons and the other states within their spheres of influence is analogous to the relationship between a global hegemon and the other states in the international system. The prominent international relations scholar John Mearsheimer writes extensively about the pursuit of regional hegemony in his book, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. According to his theory, known as offensive realism, the anarchic nature of the international system, the desire for survival, and the uncertainty about other states' intentions ultimately lead states to pursue regional hegemony. According to Mearsheimer, global hegemony is an unattainable goal; instead, a state which has achieved the level of regional hegemon will then work to prevent the development of peer competitors in other regions. Contemporary examples Contemporary examples are often politically sensitive or arguable. Often analysis of regional hegemons are based on a specific context or perspective which renders their identification subjective. The United States is a clear example of a regional hegemon in the Americas.David J. Myers. 1991. Regional Hegemons: Threat Perception and Strategic Response.

The game was developed for the ZX Spectrum by Ernieware and published by Domark, who also ported the game to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Commodore Plus/4. Gameplay The game presents the player with a blank grid to play with. The player controls a flashing cursor which can be moved at will over the canvas. Puzzle pieces are brought into play by pressing the fire button on a dispenser in the top corner of the grid. Pieces can then be slid around the screen. When a piece is moved, it can only be stopped moving by the walls of the play area or by another puzzle piece. A miniature preview of the completed image acts as a guide for the player and also highlights the piece of the puzzle that the player is currently controlling. There are a total of ten puzzles in the game. The personalities featured (in order of appearance) are: Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Neil Kinnock, Clive Sinclair, Alan Sugar, Humphrey Bogart, Charles and Diana, Fergie and Andrew, Mick Jagger and Marilyn Monroe. An updated version of the Commodore 64 game was included with Commodore's 'Night Moves/Mindbenders' C64 bundle in 1990, with Reagan, Sinclair and Sugar replaced with Helmut Kohl, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev respectively. In addition to the puzzle pieces, there are also special tiles which yield bonus points if combined correctly, which include tiles based on the personality of the puzzle, often with political or satirical themes. For example, on the Thatcher level, combining 'Dennis' and gin and tonic will yield bonus points. Other tiles included time bombs which need to either be ejected from the playing field by sliding them towards one of the holes in the sides of the playing area or combined with a water tap tile. Spitting Image Domark were forced to rename the game following legal proceedings from satirical TV puppet show Spitting Image who claimed that the original title, Splitting Images, was too close to the name of their show. Domark would later produce an unrelated, officially licensed Spitting Image game.

The term is used for motor vehicles and trains. The weight of a vehicle is influenced by passengers, cargo, even fuel level, so a number of terms are used to express the weight of a vehicle in a designated state. Gross combined weight rating (GCWR) refers to the total mass of a vehicle, including all trailers. GVWR and GCWR both describe a vehicle that is in operation and are used to specify weight limitations and restrictions. Curb weight describes a vehicle which is \\"parked at the curb\\" and excludes the weight of any occupants or cargo. Dry weight further excludes the weight of all consumables, such as fuel and oils. Gross trailer weight rating specifies the maximum weight of a trailer and the gross axle weight rating specifies the maximum weight on any particular axle. Australia A car driver licence is limited to driving vehicles up to a maximum GVM of . Beyond this, a different class of licence is required. A vehicle with a GVM up to 4,500 kg is termed a light vehicle, while those over 4,500 kg are termed heavy vehicles. Many models of small truck are manufactured to have a GVM rating of but sold with the option of a GVM of just under 4,500 kg so that they can be driven on a car licence. Often, the only difference between the models is where the exhaust exits, with diesel engined heavy rated vehicles having a vertical exhaust stack above the cabin and the light rated vehicles having the exhaust exit under the side or rear like a car. Many minor roads, including some in rural areas and some in suburban areas, have GVM restrictions such as 5,000 kg or 8,000 kg. These restrictions may be applied for technical reasons such as load limited bridges, or as a method of reducing the number of heavy vehicles on local roads. United Kingdom A standard car driving licence issued by an EU country (i.e. class B) limits the licence-holder to driving vehicles with a \\"maximum authorised mass\\" (i.e. GVWR)For the UK terms relating to the weight of vehicles, see https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-weights-explained. of . This includes holders of UK class B driving licences who passed their driving tests on or after 1 January 1997. A UK driving licence holder who passed his or her class B driving test in or before 1996 is limited to driving vehicles with a GVWR of or less, including minibuses not used for hire or reward. Anyone looking to drive a heavy goods vehicle (i.e. any vehicle other than those used for passenger transport) with a GVWR of over must obtain a class C licence. Anyone looking to drive any vehicle with a GVWR of up to must obtain a class C1 licence. Anyone with a class C licence can drive class C1 vehicles. United States In the United States, two important GVWR limitations are . Vehicles over 6,000 lb are restricted from some city roadways (though there is some dispute about whether this restriction is for actual curb weight or GVWR). Commercial vehicles over the 8,500 lb threshold are required to have insurance under Section 387.303 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980. Vehicles or combinations with a GVWR over generally require a Commercial Driver License (CDL) or a Non- Commercial Class \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" license. A CDL is also required for certain vehicles under 26,000 lb GVWR, such as buses and for-hire passenger vehicles of 16 or more passengers, all vehicles transporting placarded hazardous materials or wastes regardless of weight or load class, and any vehicle towing a trailer with a Gross Trailer Weight over where the combination weight is greater than 26,000lbs.

Built in 1933 as part of the newly constructed \\"Chertsey Arterial Road\\", the bridge connects the Old Deer Park district of Richmond (historically Surrey) on the south bank of the river to St. Margarets (historically Middlesex) on the north bank, both within the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Twickenham Bridge gets its name from the fact that it is on the road to the town of Twickenham (also in the same London borough), which is approximately 3 km upstream from Twickenham Bridge, past Richmond Bridge. Given the bridge's unique position on the river, St Margarets is actually at the southwestern end of the bridge, despite being on the north bank, while Richmond, south of the Thames, is at the northeastern end of the bridge. The bridge forms part of today's A316 (Chertsey Road), which links Central and West London with the M3 motorway at Sunbury-on-Thames. The bridge's architect was Maxwell Ayrton and the head engineer was Alfred Dryland. The proposed design of the bridge envisaged four 70 foot towers to be constructed on the riverbanks with retaining walls of 20 feet above road level. The plans were widely opposed and a local petition was organised by The Daily Telegraph against the design on the grounds that it was inappropriate to the setting in Richmond. The final design of the bridge was of three reinforced-concrete arches supported on concrete piers with Art Deco embellishments. The bridge incorporates three permanent hinges enabling the structure to adjust to changes in temperature, the first reinforced concrete bridge structure in the UK to use such an innovation.Twickenham Bridge at 75 – Transport for London accessed 5 July 2009 The arch springings, as well as the arch crowns, have decorative bronze cover plates. Ribbed shuttering was used in the casting of the concrete piers and abutments, giving the main faces a ribbed finish that was then knocked back. The approach viaduct and retaining walls were constructed in precast blocks that were wire brushed to create a rough finish.Engineering timelines.

Biography Bartolini was born in Savignano di Prato, near Prato, Tuscany. After studying at the Florentine Academy of Fine Arts, honing his skills and reputation as a modeller in alabaster, he went in 1797 to Paris, where he studied painting under Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Desmarais, and afterwards sculpture under François-Frédéric Lemot. The bas-relief Cleobis and Biton, with which he gained the second prize of the Academy in 1803, at once established his fame as a sculptor and gained for him a number of influential patrons. His bas- relief of the Battle of Austerlitz was among those executed for the column erected in Place Vendôme. He also executed many minor pieces for Vivant Denon, besides portrait busts of the opera composers Méhul and Cherubini. His great patron, however, was Napoleon, for whom he executed a colossal bust, and who sent him, on the recommendations of his sister Elisa Baciocchi, to Accademia Carrara in Bergamo in 1807, to teach sculpture, in spite of local opposition. Here he remained as the quasi-official portrait sculptor to the Buonapartes till after the fall of Napoleon. In 1833, Bartolini was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Honorary member. He then took up his residence in Florence, where he resided until his death. Monument to Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi, The Magnanimity of Elisa, Grand Duchess of Tuscany- Galleria dell'Accademia (Florence) He is buried in the Church of Santa Croce in north-east Florence. Louvre, Hermitage Lying Venus, 1820–1830, Musée Fabre, Montpellier Works In Florence, his Bonapartist associations and his departures as an artist from the strict Canovan classicism being taught at the AcademyTCI Firenze e Dintorni (1964:30) characterized most Florentine neoclassical sculptors as canoviani di modesto valore (\\"Canovans of modest worth\\"); the Florentine Galleria d'Arte Moderna used to begin with a gallery with Canova's bust of Napoleon in the center of a gallery that was surrounded by portrait busts, in which Bartolini's Bust of Carlo Ludovico di Borbone, duca di Lucca could be directly compared with busts by Bartolini's contemporaries.\\" limited his opportunities. His naturalistic and somewhat sentimental marble L'Ammostatore (\\"The Bird's-nest Stealer\\", 1820) took its inspiration from under-appreciated Quattrocento Florentine sculptors like Andrea Verrocchio. In his decade of impoverishment, supportive commissions came from foreigners; the funeral monument to Princess Sofia Zamoyski Czartoriski (died 1837) in Santa Croce, Florence's Westminster Abbey, is an anti-classical statement for naturalism. Two other Bartolini monuments in Santa Croce can be compared with it; in the Capella Giugni is his monument to Carlotta Buonaparte (died 1839), but when the occasion required a more formal approach, as in the monument to Leone Battista Alberti, the result could be chilly. A major commission came in 1830 from the sons of the Russian emigree prince Nicola Demidoff, who had retired to Florence. The sons commissioned the Monument to Nicola Demidoff to honor their father, which was placed in Piazza Demidoff, Florence. The commission's multiple figures took shape during Bartolini's last decades; it was completed by Bartolini's assistant Pasquale Romanelli. His works are varied and include an immense number of portrait busts. The best are, perhaps, the group of Charity (1824), the Hercules and Lichas and Faith in God, commissioned by the widow of Giuseppe Poldi Pezzoli. His portrait statue of Machiavelli took its place as his only commission among the long series of historical Florentine males provided for the empty exterior niches of the Uffizi.

The final chart was published on December 11, 2010, following the news of Billboard closing their London office and letting their UK-based staff go. The final number one single on the chart was \\"Only Girl (in the World)\\" by Rihanna. Currently, Nielsen SoundScan International-based Euro Digital Song Sales is the only pan-European music chart that Billboard is publishing. History =Europarade Top 40= The first attempt at a Europe-wide chart was the Europarade, which was started in early 1976 by the Dutch TROS radio network. The chart initially consisted of only six countries: the Netherlands, UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Spain. In 1979 Italy and Denmark were added and during 1980, Austria and Switzerland were included. Ireland was added as the eleventh country in October 1983. The compilers collected the top 15 records from each country and then awarded corresponding points, depending which positions between 1 and 15 each record stood at. The \\"Europarade\\" was published in Music Week and the Dutch magazine Hitkrant. =Euro Hot 100= In March 1984, Music & Media magazine in Amsterdam started their own singles chart, \\"European Top 100 Singles\\", which they published as a Eurotip sheet for the first two years. The chart was based on national singles sales charts in sixteen European countries: Austria, Belgium (separately for Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark, Finland, France, West Germany, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. This chart was accumulated by taking the chart positions in each country combined with the national sales percentage of records in that particular country. In 1986–87, the official Eurochart also became a music TV show on Music Box with Dutch presenter Erik de Zwart. A syndicated radio show, 'The Coca-Cola Eurochart Hot 100' was also introduced on UK commercial radio and was definitely being broadcast in summer-autumn 1989 and January to April 1991; however, its precise start and end dates are not known. Hosted by Pat Sharp, it was broadcast on a number of stations including Radio Trent, BRMB, Viking FM and GWR FM. A TV version was broadcast on Super Channel during 1989 and 1990, and it was hosted by Dutch presenter Caroline Tensen. The Eurochart quickly gained momentum, as it started to include more countries. On April 26, 1986, Music & Media appears as the new name of the magazine in partnership with Billboard.

Sanpellegrino S.p.A. has been part of Swiss company Nestlé since 1997 and its products are exported to most countries in Europe, the Americas, Australasia and the Middle East, as well as in Asia in Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Production The Sanpellegrino Company has ten production sites in Italy including its headquarters. More than 1,850 people work in the company. It also manages other brands like Vera, Levissima and Acqua Panna, and its revenue, according to the balance sheet of the year 2016, amounts to 895 million euros, about 96 million euros less than the previous year. 50,000 bottles of water are produced every hour in the San Pellegrino plant, for a total amount of one million bottles a day including soft drinks, sparkling water and cocktails. The bottles are then sorted to be exported to major countries around the world. In 2005, five hundred million bottles were sold globally. In 2017, that number had increased to one billion bottles. Flavors * Sparkling Mineral Water * Essenza Flavored Mineral water: Lemon, Blood Orange & Black Raspberry, Dark Morello Cherry & Pomegranate, and Tangerine & Wild Strawberry * Sparkling Real Fruit Juice Beverage: Blood Orange, Lemon, Lemon Mint, Orange, Grapefruit and Pomegranate, Tangerine Mineral water production S.Pellegrino mineral water is produced in San Pellegrino Terme. The water may originate from a layer of rock below the surface, where it is mineralized from contact with limestone and volcanic rocks. The springs are located at the foot of a dolomite mountain wall which favours the formation and replenishment of a mineral water basin. The water then seeps to depths of over and flows underground to a distant aquifer. The water from the spring is not naturally carbonated; rather, gas is added prior to packaging.  History  1 litre bottle A 500 ml (16.9 oz) bottle of San Pellegrino sparkling water S.Pellegrino mineral water has been produced for over 620 years. In 1395, the town borders of San Pellegrino were drawn, marking the start of its water industry. Leonardo da Vinci is said to have visited the town in 1509 to sample and examine the town's miraculous water, later writing a treatise on water. Analysis shows that the water is strikingly similar to the samples taken in 1782, the first year such analysis took place. In fact, doctors from Northern Italy in the 13th Century used to suggest that their patients go to the Val Brembana spring for treatment. Over the years, its therapeutic properties attracted many visitors, and, at the beginning of 1900, San Pellegrino Terme became a holiday resort with a casino, thermal baths and a hotel. In 1794 a treatise mentioned S.Pellegrino water as a treatment method for kidney stone disease. In 1839, S.Pellegrino water was recommended for people affected with kidney diseases and urinary tract infection. In 1760, Pellegrino Foppoli built a bathhouse where visitors had to pay a fee to use the indoor facilities. In 1803, Foppoli's descendants sold the bathhouse to Giovanni Pesenti who wanted to construct a larger building. The town council feared that this project would prevent visitors from free use of the spring. For this reason, they filed a complaint with the prefect which led Ester Pesenti and Lorenzo Palazzolo to sign an agreement in 1831. They decided that the 24 unit spring would be divided into two. So that, 17 units were given to Pesenti and Palazzolo and 7 units to San Pellegrino Terme town council. In 1834, the flood of the Brembo, the river that crosses San Pellegrino Terme, caused serious damage in the valley. Since the restoration required huge expenses, in 1837 the town leased Pesenti and Palazzolo its share of the water for 12 years. In 1841, Ester Pesenti requested an authorization to continue to expand the bathhouse. One year later, another flood hit the valley and San Pellegrino Terme sold three-quarters of its shares to Pesenti. Since the water had always been connected to the territory, they agreed to give the remaining quarter of the shares to the residents of the town who still can use an external tap free of charge. The construction work finished in 1846. When Queen Margherita visited the town in 1905, many articles appeared on the Giornale di San Pellegrino, in which it was illustrated that the bottled mineral water was sold in the main Italian cities, in many cities around Europe, as well as in Cairo, Tangiers, Shanghai, Calcutta, Sydney, Brazil, Peru, and the United States. At that time, one case of 50 bottles cost 26 Italian lire, while a case of 24 bottles cost 14 Italian lire. At the beginning of the 20th century, carbon dioxide was added to S.Pellegrino to prevent the development of bacteria, especially during long overseas travels. It is still taken from sources in Tuscany and sent to San Pellegrino Terme. The spa facilities were renovated, and in 1928, they were equipped with more modern tools for various diagnostic needs, such as the radioscopic and radiograph room and the microscopic and chemical analysis laboratory. In addition, Granelli reorganized the bottling plant with new equipment, which moved up to a production capacity of 120,000 bottles a day. At the beginning, it was a handmade production, then it became gradually mechanized and was managed by an all female staff. The first machinery was introduced in 1930 and, since that moment, the amount produced has been increasing. Subsequently, the company began a packaging process for shipping to the recipient countries. In 1961, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. started to produce bottled mineral water and other beverages in the new San Pellegrino Terme factory. In 1932, the Aranciata orangeade variant was introduced. Containing S.Pellegrino as its primary ingredient, the soda added concentrated orange juice. Today, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. also produces various other flavors of carbonated beverages: Limonata (lemonade), Sanbittèr (bitters), Pompelmo (grapefruit), Aranciata Rossa (blood orange), and Chinò (chinotto). In 1968, S.Pellegrino appeared on the front cover of the British Sunday newspaper The Observer. During the Italian Occupation of Ethiopia production was curtailed in its entirety for the Italian military water needs. During this time they advocated for the policy changes Mussolini's government had been implementing. This increased revenue dramatically for several years, even after the occupation had faltered. Over the years, the bottling lines increased the production levels needed to satisfy the needs of a market which was becoming more and more sophisticated, and in 2012 a high speed PET bottling line was installed. The company built a new plant some kilometers beyond the previous one as the water production continued to grow. On April 20, 1970 the water company changed its name from Società Anonima Delle Terme di S.Pellegrino to Sanpellegrino S.p.A. In the early seventies, it was decided to no longer use mineral water in the production of soft drinks, and to substitute it with spring water which was treated with particular equipment. In 1997, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. was bought by Perrier Vittel SA, a division of Nestlé which also owned the Perrier and Vittel bottled water brands. In Italy, S.Pellegrino is available in 1.5 L bottles for about one euro, the same for their Aranciata in most stores. Competitive orange drinks can cost even less. If artificial sweeteners are used, the price is about half that of the sugared varieties. Paolo Luni, who joined the company as a consultant, then became General Manager and eventually CEO, left the company in 1999 after having inaugurated the Sanpellegrino Centennial celebrations, which took place in Teatro La Scala in Milan. The company now became the complete property of Nestlé Group. In May 2014, Sanpellegrino S.p.A. released two new flavors of their Sparkling Fruit Beverages. The new flavors were Melograno e Arancia (Pomegranate and Orange) and Clementina (Clementine). They were announced through an installation at Eataly's La Scuola Grande in New York where large cans of the new soda flavors were constructed out of flowers. The bottle The bottles' packaging has maintained the original references to its territory and its first productions. The products on the market can be divided into two categories: glass and PET. The shape of the glass bottles has remained the same since its origin in 1899. The model is called Vichy because at that time San Pellegrino Terme was known as \\"the Italian Vichy\\", and it is characterized by the elongated shape of the bottle. The red star was a symbol of high quality products exported from Italy between the 1800s and the 1900s. On the neck of the bottle there is a representation of the Casino, above the date of foundation of the brand and the company. The label has a white and blue watermark, which recalls the Belle Epoque style. The PET line has the same shape of the glass bottles. The production started at the end of the 1990s with the aim of maintaining the same perlage and effervescence of the glass line. At the beginning, only the 50 centiliters size was produced, but since 2006, the production of the 33, 75 and 100 centilitre bottles were added to the original one. Different versions of the label were created for collaborations, partnerships and international events. In 2010, 2011 and 2013 the project \\"S.Pellegrino Meets Italian Talents\\" was meant to create collaborations with Italians known on an international level as a symbol of Italy. These collaborations include Missoni, Bulgari and a tribute to Luciano Pavarotti. = Accomplishments = * 2009: 110th anniversary since the foundation of the Società Anonima delle Terme di San Pellegrino.

Nestlé was informed about this and responded that uranium was common in both bottled and tap water and that the 0.0070mg/l found in their product was below the 0.03 mg/l threshold established by various governments and food health organizations. S.Pellegrino is not suitable for infants under 12 weeks of age, because their gastrointestinal tract and urinary system is immature and cannot withstand highly mineralized water.

The film was directed by J. Lee Thompson. The story line of the film is considerably different from that of Gogol's novel, although it is closer to his expanded 1842 (pro-Russian Imperial) edition than his original (pro-Ukrainian) version of 1835. Plot The film opens in the 16th century, when Ukraine, Russia, Poland and Eastern Europe were divided into small sections and principalities that fought each other or against one enemy: in this case, the Ottoman Empire. It starts with a battle raging between the Turks and the Poles. The Poles are losing until the Cossacks arrive to save the day. However, it turns out that the Poles were merely holding back so that they could treacherously attack the Cossacks after they won the battle for them. As a result, the Poles become masters of Ukraine and the Cossacks are subjugated. Taras Bulba, one of the Cossack officers, returns home to raise his family but now it is under Polish dominion. Several years later, Taras sends his two sons, Andriy (Tony Curtis) and Ostap (Perry Lopez) to the academy at Kyiv, to obtain a Polish education. There, the eldest son, Andriy, falls in love with a Polish princess Natalia Dubrov (played by Christine Kaufmann), to the ire of the locals, who treat the Cossack brothers like scum of the earth. Ultimately, the brothers are forced to flee Kiev, returning to their father’s house on the Ukrainian steppes. There, word comes that the Poles want the Cossacks to raise an army to help them in a new war in the Baltic region. When Andriy objects, he is accused of being a coward. This is a serious offense that can only be resolved by a test of courage. Andriy and his accuser ride and jump their horses over a chasm until God chooses which one is right by having the accuser fall to his death. Taras embraces Andriy’s lead and plans to betray the Poles and take back Ukraine. Assuming command of the Cossacks, Taras leads them to Dubno, where the Poles are expecting him to join them. Instead, the Cossacks attack the Polish army and drive it back into the city. The Cossacks then lay siege to the city. Hunger and disease set in and Andriy, fearing for the life of his Polish lover, sneaks into the city in an attempt to rescue her. He is captured and she is condemned to be burned at the stake for the crime of loving a Cossack. To save her, Andriy agrees to lead a raiding party to bring cattle into the starving city. Meanwhile, the Cossacks have grown bored with the inactivity of the siege and a large number of them have departed for home. When the Polish commander realizes the weakness of the Cossacks against the raiding force, he orders his whole army to attack. Taras Bulba encounters his son on the field of battle and kills him for his betrayal before joining the general retreat to the edge of a cliff. There, the Cossacks who left the siege to go home, rejoin the battle and large numbers of men and horses, both Cossack and Polish, are pushed over the edge to their deaths in the river below. The movie ends with the Cossacks victorious and entering Dubno. Andriy is to be buried there, as “... it is now a Cossack city.” By the words of Hetman Taras Bulba, the Cossacks will not treat the Poles as badly as they were treated by them: \\"We will not ravage. We will not pillage. We will burn out the plague, and open the supply wagons, and feed the people of our city.\\" Cast * Tony Curtis as Andriy Bulba * Yul Brynner as Taras Bulba * Christine Kaufmann as Natalia Dubrov * Sam Wanamaker as Filipenko * Brad Dexter as Shilo * Guy Rolfe as Prince Grigory * Perry Lopez as Ostap Bulba * George Macready as Governor * Ilka Windish as Sofia Bulba * Vladimir Sokoloff as Old Stepan * Vladimir Irman as Grisha Kubenko * Daniel Ocko as Ivan Mykola * Abraham Sofaer as Abbot * Mickey Finn as Korzh * Richard Rust as Capt.

The company has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London (TfL) since May 2010 and has now been rebranded as \\"London Underground\\". However, the Tube Lines' logo remain widely visible on staff uniforms and vehicle liveries. Tube Lines' headquarters were at 15 Westferry Circus, London. Tube Lines was established under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme in 2003 to provide maintenance services to the London Underground, together with another company, Metronet. Metronet entered administration in 2008 and was bought by TfL. Tube Lines was also bought by TfL in 2010 following a funding shortfall. History The company was founded by a consortium of Amey plc (a subsidiary of Grupo Ferrovial), Bechtel and Jarvis plc. In 2005, Jarvis sold its stake to fellow shareholder Amey for £147 million. From January 2003 until May 2011 the London Underground operated a Public-Private Partnership (PPP), whereby the infrastructure assets were maintained by private companies but it was owned and operated by London Underground (LU), part of TfL. Tube Lines had a 30-year contract for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, and remains responsible for over 200 miles of track, 255 trains, 100 stations, and over 2,500 bridges, lifts and escalators. The remaining lines of the London Underground were part of Metronet, which existed from 2003 to 2008, when it was taken over by Transport for London after being placed into administration. Tube Lines encountered a funding shortfall for its upgrades and requested that TfL provide an additional £1.75 billion to cover the shortfall; TfL refused, and referred the matter to the PPP arbiter, who stated that £400 million should be provided. There had been many discussions over the future of the company in the second review period, and it was announced on 7 May 2010 that Transport for London had agreed to buy the shares of Bechtel and Amey (Ferrovial) from Tube Lines for £310 million. Combined with the takeover of Metronet, this meant that all maintenance was thereafter managed in-house, despite TfL using a large number of private suppliers and contractors. Amey continued to provide TfL with management and maintenance services for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines until the end of 2017 when London Underground Limited took over from Amey.

The Escuela Superior de Comercio Carlos Pellegrini (Carlos Pellegrini High School of Commerce, ESCCP) is a public high school in Buenos Aires, and it is one of the most prestigious in Argentina and Latin America. Founded on February 19, 1890 by President Carlos Pellegrini under the name of Escuela de Comercio de la Capital de la República (Commerce School of the Republic's Capital), it would become the first vocational school in the country, enabling its graduates to be the first with the high school degree required for admission in Economic Sciences' Colleges. The school was renamed in 1908, taking its current denomination. In 1931, the school was placed under the control of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), and in 1953 women were given the right to study in the institution. As the school is under the UBA control, the high school diplomas are issued by the University of Buenos Aires itself. Most, if not all of the teaching staff also teaches at the UBA, and Physical Education classes take place at the UBA's Ciudad Universitaria (campus). This relationship between the school and the University also gives graduated students the possibility of attending an extra 6th year for a degree in Ciencias Comerciales (Bachelor in Commercial Science); the subjects for this academic year are equivalent to the UBA's Ciclo Básico Común (CBC - Common Basic Cycle; a year of basic subjects study, mainly aimed to level students from different high school backgrounds) plus four other assignments. This extra curricular year entitles the students to enter the UBA in many majors, specially including economy-related ones, without the need of attending the CBC. In the year 2005, several changes were made in what concerns to the CBC. Students can now make the entry course to any university, and not only to the economy-oriented ones. The number of applicants in 2008 for the 2009 school year has dropped to 550, about half of the number of students who applied in 2007, and previous years.La Nación Many of the students who did not apply to Carlos Pellegrini, chose similar institutions elsewhere, such as the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, or the Instituto Libre de Segunda EnseñanzaLa Nación The main building was designed by Italian architect Gino Aloisi (1864 - 1924), and inaugurated in 1909.  Location  The Carlos Pellegrini High School of Commerce is located on 1851 Marcelo T. de Alvear Street, between Riobamba St. and Callao Avenue (Avenida Callao), in the neighbourhood of Recoleta. The phone number is (+54 11) 4815-4001/5. Several bus routes serve the school and its vicinity: 12, 29, 37, 39, 60, 99, 101, 106, 108, 109, 111, 124, 132, 140, 150 and 152, as well as Line D and Line B of the Buenos Aires Metro (Subte). Admission The school's admission process is highly competitive. Every year, about 1500 students apply, all of which are attending the 7th year (Grade 7) of their Primary School. These students are subject to 12 exams divided into four major areas: Mathematics, History, Geography and Spanish. They are required to take three tests of each one of the subjects mentioned above. Entry to the school is quite limited, as around 450 of the applicants finally achieve their goal. Two tests are given in a same day, and students can leave school earlier than during normal class days. The first 6 exams are three from Spanish and three from History. Then, after the winter holidays (2 weeks) they start with the Maths and Geography classes. The distribution of the tests is the same as the first part of the year. Politics The school is one of the most politically active high schools in Argentina, with a high percentage of militant students who organise themselves in the Centro de Estudiantes del Carlos Pellegrini (Carlos Pellegrini Student's Center). The Student Center, usually referred to as CECaP, holds annual elections and, until the year 2005, was subdivided in different areas, such as Sports, Charity Action, Press and Culture; since 2006, though, it's divided in Comisiones (commissions) created by the students, under the supervision of the Comisión de delegados (Delegates commission) This system is more democratic than the old system, since the commissions now are created by and their membership determined by students, whereas previously they were managed by the political parties. The CECaP is well known for its left-wing character.

It was later also screened on the Seven Network. It was part of a trilogy and followed on from the six part serial The Interpretaris in 1966 and seven part serial Vega 4 in 1968. However, it had 26 standalone episodes produced to make it viable as a syndicated series. Each of the series had different crews and casts but took place in the same future and used the same space organisation and miniatures, much as Star Trek did in the '80s and '90s, thus making it the first TV sci-fi franchise. Plot The series was set in the year 2500 AD and followed the adventures of the crew of the galactic patrol ship Phoenix Five, \\"the most sophisticated craft in the Earth Space Control Fleet.\\" This handpicked team consisted of Captain Roke, a typical heroic Kirk-style commander with a solution to every problem; Ensign Adam Hargraves, his stalwart young second-in-command always ready to shoot first and skip the questions; compassionate young navigator Cadet Tina Kulbrick; and their clunky, glass-domed Computeroid robot Karl. Together they patrolled the outer galaxies defending the innocent and warding off the repeated plots and attacks of the evil balding, blue-skinned humanoid Zodian of Zebula 9 and the eccentric pointy-eared renegade scientist Platonus. Zodian originally appeared in Vega 4, and he and his head-shaped twin computers Alpha and Zeta were in the first 13 episodes of Phoenix Five, then were replaced by Platonus and his Cockney-accented computer Tommy for the latter half. This was due to a production break caused by the untimely death of producer Peter Summerton. Summerton had produced the popular and very controversial drama series You Can't See 'round Corners for ATN 7 the previous year, and was replaced by John Walters. Production Phoenix Five was produced in 1969 in Sydney by Artransa Park Television in association with the Australian Broadcasting Commission and Amalgamated Television Services. The series premiered on ABC television on Friday 24 April 1970 at 5:40pm with other states following in May 1970. It also was sold internationally and screened in the UK and other overseas markets in the 1970 & 1980s. It was repeated on the ABC in 1975 with the advent of Colour TV and last screened on ATN 7 and regional stations including WIN 4 Wollongong in the early 80's. All episodes exist complete in The National Sound and Film Archive but there has been no commercial release of the series, though odd eps of Interpretaris and Vega 4 and a dozen or so off air recordings of Phoenix Five have circulated among TV collectors since the 90's and found their way to YouTube at various times. The series has often been belittled as a \\"Star Trek with gumtrees\\" but the original Interpretaris was made before Star Trek screened in Australia and it resembles more the children's TV space adventure series of the Fifties and Sixties like Rocky Jones, Space Ranger and Fireball XL5, which had been screened a number of times on Australian Television. It also has been criticized for its low budget, but being made on film and in colour would have made it more expensive than most Australian dramas of this period. Australia at this time did not have the numerous movie and TV spfx technicians that worked on US and UK productions and FX supervisor Peter Hicks really had to start from scratch. Indeed, costumes for the series were very expensive, ranging from floor-length robes for Zodian, pink tights for the 'microbe' girl (played by Arna-Maria Winchester) from the Planet Leonicus (from episode 3- To end is to begin), gold lame suits for the Phoenix Five crew and an aluminium suit for Karl the robot, with a perspex head covering fibreglass bulbs. Hicks said, of creating the 'Galaxy Garden' aboard the Phoenix Five: \\"I got ordinary commercial plastic plants and butchered them to make them look strange.

Bassarab is a two time Stampede International Tag Team champion. Wrestling historian Dave Meltzer described Bassarab as a semi-spectacular in-ring performer.Meltzer, Dave. \\"The Wrestling Observer's Who's who in Pro Wrestling\\". Wrestling Observer Newsletter. page 21. (1986) Early life Born in 1960 he is the son of Betty and Rusty Bassarab. He has two sisters named Whitney and Wendy and a brother, Rusty. Betty died of cancer in the early 80s and his father died in the late 90s. He grew up in Elbow Park, Calgary. Bassarab played hockey and football with the Glencoe Club. He also rode in some rodeos. Professional wrestling career Around 1981 Bassarab was encouraged by his future brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith to pursue pro wrestling. Bassarab was trained by Stu Hart and debuted in Hart's Calgary, Alberta based Stampede Wrestling promotion under his own name in 1983. Bassarab formed a tag team with Phil Lafleur.McCoy (2005). p. 199. They faced Danny Davis and Hubert Gallant for the Stampede International Tag Team Championship in early 1984, but the match was ruled a no-contest and the title was vacated. The acquisition of Stampede by Vince McMahon (owner of the World Wrestling Federation, WWF) in 1985 led to many Stampede wrestlers being signed by the WWF. The British Bulldogs, Jim Neidhart, Owen Hart, and Bret Hart were all hired, but Bassarab was not. When Ben was going to sign on when Agent at the time Chief Jay Strongbow asked Ben when he could start, Ben replied that he could start today. Strongbow said that he would want Ben to give his 2-week notice with Stampede. Ben replied to Jay that Stu fired him as he and Allison split up. Jay told Ben that he hopes that Stu will not mind as his son Marc was going to live and train at Stu place and he hopes that this will not be a conflict, if it is that Jay told Ben that he would have to wait. Stu tried to use this leverage against Ben and told Ben that if he gets back together then he would get hired with WWF. Ben declined though he did face WWF wrestler Brutus Beefcake at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on July 28, 1985. Bassarab substituted for the absent Tony Garea and lost to Beefcake. Bassarab began pursuing the International Tag Team Championship once more and began teaming with Chris Benoit. On March 1, 1986 in Regina, Saskatchewan, Bassarab and Benoit defeated Honky Tonk Man, Wayne Farris, and Rotten Ron Starr for the International Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Farris and his new partner, The Cuban Assassin, on March 21 in Calgary. Bassarab then formed a new team with his brother-in-law, Owen Hart.McCoy (2005). p. 214. On August 9 in Edmonton, Alberta they defeated Duke Myers and Kerry Brown for the International Tag Team Championship. They held the title until October 3, when they lost to The Viet Cong Express (Hiroshi Hase and Fumihiro Niikura) in Calgary. Bassarab and Owen feuded with the Express throughout Western Canada, on one occasion fighting to a forty-five-minute draw, but were unable to regain the International Tag Team Championship. Bassarab remained with Stampede for the remainder of his career. During the 80s Bassarab took short tours in Japan, working for Japan Pro-Wrestling, and All Japan Pro Wrestling. In 1987 Bassarab worked for the North American Wrestling Association. He also worked for the WWF when they toured Alberta in the 80s, and retired in 1992. Personal life He married Stu Hart's daughter Alison Hart in May 1983.McCoy (2005). p. 241.McCoy (2005). p. 155. They were married briefly, before leaving Alison when she was pregnant with their second daughter. They have two children, Lindsay and Brooke, both children are close to Davey Boy Smith's children. Brooke is Married to wrestler Peter Minnema, better known under his ring name, Pete Wilson. Bassarab regularly visited B.J's Gym in Calgary, which was owned by his brother-in-law B.J. Annis. He also worked in the juice bar at the gym for some time before becoming a wrestler. In 1988 Bassarab was stabbed in a barfight, the incident damaged his liver severely. After divorcing Hart he remarried at some point. He and his new wife attended both of the two funeral services for former brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith held by Smith's girlfriend Andrea Redding, and the other was held by former sister-in-law Diana Hart-Smith. Bassarab later became a truck driver and, later, a warehouse foreman before retiring to run a vending machine and real estate company that he and his wife Kathy owned in Calgary. They sold of the business and moved down to the Maritimes. When asking Ben why he replied he just wanted peace in his life.

His studies focused on Viet Nam and other South-East Asian cultures. He was born in Bourges to an academic family, and grew up in northern Viet Nam (Tonkin). In 1907 his father opened the College de Protectorate in Hanoi and he would graduate from the college some 12 years later. At the outbreak of World War II he was serving as a platoon commander leading a colonial unit in combat at Valvin and Sully-sur- Loire for which he would be awarded the Croix de Guerre. In 1942 he joined the Free French Forces in Africa. He trained with British commandos in Ceylon in 1944-1945 and then in January 1945 he was parachuted into Tonkin to rally French and Vietnamese to the Free French cause. He was in Hanoi on 9 March when the Japanese overthrew the Vichy French administration and he then escaped the city and walked to join up with French colonial forces retreating into southern China. On September 2, 1945, he was with General Philippe Leclerc on the to receive the Surrender of Japan for France and subsequently served as his political advisor when France returned to Indochina and started the colonial reconquest. In 1947, Mus became the political advisor to Émile Bollaert, the new French High Commissioner of Indochina. On 10 May 1947 Bollaert dispatched Mus to make contact with Ho Chi Minh and after walking through Viet Minh held territory he arrived at Ho's headquarters on May 12, 1947. Mus had been authorised to offer Ho a ceasefire on three conditions: 1. the Viet Minh were to lay down their weapons, 2. French troops were to be allowed to circulate freely in areas held by them and 3. all French Foreign Legion deserters held by the Viet Minh were to be returned to French control. Ho refused the offer commenting \\"In the French Union there is no place for cowards, if I accepted these conditions I would be one.\\" He later served as a professor at both the Collège de France and Yale University. He wrote widely on Buddhism and comparative linguistics. He was deeply affected by the death of his son Émile Mus in 1961 during the Algerian War. He was interviewed in the 1968 documentary film In the Year of the Pig. Mus is survived by a daughter, Laurence Émilie Rimer (née Mus); his son-in-law, J. Thomas Rimer is also a scholar of Asia, specializing in Japanese literature and drama.Chandler, David. \\"Paul Mus (1902–1969): A Biographical Sketch\\".

When established, it was the North West Company's farthest outpost in the Columbia River region. An American rival of the NWC, the Pacific Fur Company opened a station adjacent to Spokane House, called Fort Spokane. The War of 1812 and ongoing supply issues caused the collapse of the PFC, with its posts now under the control of the NWC. The original Spokane House was abandoned in favor of Fort Spokane, though the latter location was still called Spokane House. The second Spokane House saw use as a major post in the interior Oregon Country until the NWC was absorbed by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821. During a general tour of the Pacific Northwest, Spokane House was abandoned by George Simpson in 1825, in favor of a new post that became Fort Colvile. The site of Spokane House is in Spokane County in the U.S. state of Washington, just northwest of the city of Spokane. North West Company Spokane House was created under direction of David Thompson and built by Jaco Finlay during the winter of 1810–1811.Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Finlay would remain among the Sqeliz until Thompson's return later in 1811. Visiting the station in June 1811, Thompson noted that Spokane House was the place \\"where I left a small assortment of Goods to continue the trade, there were forty Tents of Spokane Indians, with Jaco, a half breed, as Clerk.\\"Thompson, David. David Thompson's Narrative. Edited by J. B. Tyrrell. Toronto: The Champlain Society. 1916, p. Thompson would soon depart for the mouth of the Columbia River, discovering the rival Fort Astoria. Fort Spokane Fort Spokane was a competing station opened by the Pacific Fur Company, a venture headquartered at Fort Astoria and funded solely by John Jacob Astor. The arrival of an expedition originating in St. Louis led by W. Price Hunt along with sorely needed supplies and reinforcements from the Beaver early in 1812 allowed to company to establish more trade posts to compete against the NWC. Among the various parties directed to leave Fort Astoria for the interior was an outfit headed by John Clarke. This party was directed to create \\"a district headquarters for trade in what is now eastern Washington and Oregon, northern Idaho, and western Montana.\\"Ronda, James. Astoria & Empire. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. 1990, pp. 240–241. This group was directed to open a station in proximity to the Spokane House. Relations with the neighboring Sqeliz were peaceable, with the post gate often left open at night. Illim-Spokanee, the father of Spokane Garry, would trade with both fur company posts. Despite being competitors, talks with NWC employees at Spokane House were amicable. McMillan agreed to join Clarke in not selling alcohol to the natives. Parties of traders were supplied to trade with neighboring Indigenous nations in an effort to counter the NWC. François Pillet led a party of six to reside with the Ktunaxa to oppose the Kootanae House and Russel Farnham commanded a group of men to near Saleesh House in the Bitterroot Salish homeland.Cox Ross. The Columbia River. Vol. 1 London: Coburn & Bently. 1831, pp. 188–189. Leaving Farnham's group, Ross returned to the post shortly before 1 January 1813. The PFC laborers had as Ross recalled: > \\"a snug and commodious dwelling-house, containing four rooms and a kitchen; > together with a comfortable house for the men, and a capacious store for the > furs and trading goods; the whole surrounded by paling, and flanked by two > bastions with loopholes for musketry.Cox (1831), p. 196-199. When the Astorian wintering parties returned in early May, departure for Fort Astoria was set for 25 May 1813. The majority of the PFC laborers were in this party, with four men under Pillet left at Fort Spokane.Cox (1831), p. 202. Reaching Fort Astoria in August, the group learned the unfortunate news of the War of 1812 and consensus to sell the PFC assets, including Fort Spokane, to the NWC. NWC hegemony Operations based at Spokane House were relocated to Fort Spokane, though the PFC station took the NWC station's name. It became was the North West Company's central depot in the Oregon Country interior but problems with the location of Spokane House were evident. Spokane House was poorly connected to other posts and reliant upon transport by large pack trains, rather than being able to use water transport. This made the company dependent upon the Nez Perce for a supply of horses. During this annual transportation of trade goods to Spokane House, thirty five to forty men were employed by the NWC.Simpson, George. Fur Trade and Empire. Edited by Frederick Merk. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1968. pp. 43–48. Despite several proposals to abandon Spokane House, it remained popular among company employees. Fort Nez Percés was ranked as the main interior post in 1818. HBC The Hudson's Bay Company took over control of the NWC in 1821 and sent George Simpson to tour the new western possessions of the HBC throughout 1824 and 1825. He visited the station accompanied by John McLoughlin, McMillian, and Peter Skene Ogden late in October 1824. Many of laborers that worked at Spokane House and its subsidiary stations of the Flathead Post and Kootanae House did not receive favorable reviews by Simpson. In particular he found many lazy, \\"the very scum of the country... the most unruly and troublesome gang... are under no control & feel their own independence, they therefore require very superior management to make anything of them...\\" Simpson reduced the employees stationed at Spokane House for 1825 by seven, leaving only fifteen.Simpson (1968), p. 66. Simpson returned to the station in April 1825. He began discussions with the Spokane House management to abandon Spokane House in favor of the Kettle Falls. This was due to several reasons including, the distance of Spokane House from the Columbia River, the scarcity of fur bearing populations in the area, and the abundance of fish and promising agricultural prospects at the latter location.Simpson (1968), p. 134. That year work began near Kettle Falls on a new fur post, Fort Colvile. Later history In 1846 by the Oregon Treaty, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ceded all claims to lands in the Pacific Northwest south of the 49th parallel to the United States of America. Archeological digs were carried out at the Spokane House site in 1950–53 and 1962–63.

Selection is made of pupils at age 11 and 13 although plans are being made to only accept pupils from the age of 11 in the future. The current Headmaster is Dr John Weeds. History The school was founded after the death of the John Blubery, a yeoman of the King's Armoury. In his will he decreed that if the child of his daughter be a girl, then his mansion house be turned into a free school for the poor children of Cranbrook. Queen Elizabeth I granted the school charter in 1574, which is now housed in the library. =Recent history= In 2003 alumnus Piers Sellers, a NASA astronaut, took a copy of the school charter into space with him. A photo is exhibited in the school cafeteria. In 2005 Sellers opened the school's observatory, which is named after him. This observatory houses the 22.5-inch Alan Young telescope operated by the Cranbrook and District Science and Astronomy Society (CADSAS). In May 2010 Sellers took into outer space aboard the Space Shuttle an original watercolour portrait of Cranbrook School painted by Brenda Barratt. The painting was later returned to Cranbrook School with the official NASA verification that it has travelled into space.BBC News report, 25 January 2010 In 2018, a new day house specifically for the 120 students in Years 7 and 8 was named after Piers Sellers. In December 2019, current headteacher John Weeds announced he is leaving at the end of the academic year. Campus =Barham House= Barham House is the school's main office. It contains the reception room, the offices of both the headmaster and the deputy head, and meeting rooms. The school medical centre is also in Barham House, but has its own reception and entrance. The building was originally the local vicarage. =The Library= Central to the school, there is a large library which is one of the oldest parts of the school. It was once the school hall, but it was converted to the library after the number of pupils became to big to fit in the hall. School assemblies are currently held in the local church, St Dunstan's, or the Queen's Hall Theatre. The library also plays host to the original royal charter provided to the school by Queen Elizabeth I in 1588. =Queen’s Hall Theatre= The school is home to the local theatre, the Queen’s Hall. It is used for a number of both internal (performed and organised by students) and external productions, as well as some school assemblies. Many external productions are performed by Cranbrook Operatic and Dramatic Society (CODS). The school has their own technical team who help with most internal productions. Houses Since September 2019, the school has five day houses and six boarding houses. Formerly the day houses Allan, Horsley and Webster were split along gendered lines with the total number of houses (both day and boarding arriving at: seven for boys and five for girls. The reasons for the recent merger were not provided but rumours circulated among the student body that it was due to the increasing visibility of transgender students. Each house works in conjunction with the main school to provide pastoral care and academic support. =Boys' boarding houses= * Cornwallis * Crowden * Rammell * School Lodge (only for Year Nine boys) =Girls' boarding houses= * Blubery * Scott =Day houses= * Allan House, formerly split: ** Allan Boys ** Allan Girls *Horsley House, formerly split: ** Horsley Boys ** Horsley Girls *Webster House, formerly split: ** Webster Boys ** Webster Girls * Lynx * Sellers (Junior School) Notable Old Cranbrookians * General Sir John Akehurst KCB CBE, Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Europe from 1987–90, and President from 1991-9 of the United Kingdom Reserve Forces Association * Sir Anthony Barnes Atkinson, Professor of Economics at the University of Oxford * Air Chief Marshal Sir John Barraclough CB CBE, Station Commander of RAF Biggin Hill from 1954–56 * Emma Biggs, mosaic artist * Hugo Burnham, drummer for the English rock group Gang of Four and Associate Professor at the New England Institute of Art * Jon Cleary, Grammy award-winning musician * Canon John Collins, radical clergyman and political campaigner * Michael Croucher TV film producerMichael Croucher * Barry Davies, sports commentator * Louise Dean, Novelist * Phil Edmonds, cricketer * Dr Henry Ford (professor) Professor of Arabic and Principal of Magdalen Hall, Oxford * Karin Giannone, Journalist and news presenter at BBC News * Henri Gillet, Professor of Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago * Harry Hill (Dr. Matthew Hall), comedian * Sir Victor Horsley, pioneering neurosurgeon * Wing Commander Sir Norman Hulbert, Conservative MP from 1935–50 for Stockport from 1935–50, and for Stockport North from 1950–64 * Arthur Surridge Hunt, papyrologist * Prof Richard L.

It is the ocean region where the warm Indian Ocean and the cold Atlantic Ocean meet. This convergence leads to treacherous sailing conditions, accounting for numerous wrecked ships in the area over the years. However, the meeting of the oceans here also fuels the nutrient cycle for marine life, making it one of the best fishing grounds in South Africa. Extent and characteristics The South African marine bioregions from the 2004 classification. South African marine ecoregions from the 2011 classification The Agulhas Bank stretches approximately along the African coast, from off Cape Peninsula (18°E) to Port Alfred (26°E), and up to from it. The bank slopes down relatively steeply from the coast to about deep and reaches before dropping steeply to on its southern edge. The shelf spans an area of with a mean depth slightly over . It is entirely within the exclusive economic zone of South Africa. The National Spatial Biodiversity Assessment 2004 recognised 34 biozones nested within 9 bioregions (of which four were offshore). The National Biodiversity Assessment 2011 replaced these ecozones and biozones with the terms ecoregions and ecozones. In 2011, the Agulhas Ecoregion was divided into four distinct ecozones: Agulhas inshore, Agulhas inner shelf, Agulhas outer shelf, and Agulhas shelf edge. 33 different benthic habitats types were identified on the Agulhas Bank. There are dozens of warm temperate reefs along the coast of the Agulhas Ecoregion spanning from below sea level. Many rocky sub-tidal reefs are of aeolianite or sandstone origin, but granite, quartzite and siltstone reefs are also present. The Agulhas reefs are very heterogeneous and include several possible different sub-types. Some of the reefs are within protected areas, but only a few of those protected areas include protection from fishing. Oceanography The Agulhas Bank is a natural boundary between ocean currents from the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Southern Ocean, resulting in one of the most turbulent waters of the world oceans. =Agulhas Current= Eddies of the Agulhas Current meanders past the Agulhas Bank leaking warm and salty water into the South Atlantic before retroflecting back into the Indian Ocean The Agulhas Current flows south along the African east-coast and along the south-eastern edge of the bank. It then retroflects back into the Indian Ocean south-west of the bank. This retroflection results in intense eddy activities such as meanders, eddies, and filaments. In upper layer water, the Agulhas rings and eddies move warm and salty water into the large South Atlantic gyre, which exports it to the tropics. In the lower ocean layers water is transported in the opposite direction. Upwellings Cyclonic eddies is another source of edge upwelling west of Port Elisabeth. Plumes of warm surface water migrate onto the bank along its eastern edge, providing subtropical surface water from the Indian Ocean. In summer, easterly winds can intermittently drive coastal upwelling along the South African south coast. The Agulhas Bank is dominated by westerly winds and most of the upwelling on the bank is related to the interaction of the Agulhas Current on the eastern edge, but easterly winds do occur, especially in summer and fall, and can generate local upwelling cells. As the current is diverged away from the coast, dynamic processes draws an onshore Ekman layer of cold water from below the warm shelf-edge flow. In spring and summer, at a depth of , a semi-permanent ridge of cold water is present on the eastern and central shelf. In summer, there is mixture of subtropical water separated by thermoclines from cool waters, but there is a considerable seasonal variation. On the shelf, bottom waters exhibit characteristics of the central Indian Ocean in the east and central Atlantic Ocean waters in the west. Agulhas meanders and Natal pulses As the Agulhas Current flows south along the African east coast, it tends to bulge inshore frequently, a deviation from the current's normal path known as Agulhas Current meanders (ACM). These bulges are occasionally (1-7 times per year) followed by a much larger offshore bulge, known as Natal pulses (NP). Natal pulses move along the coast at per day. An ACM can bulge up to and a NP up to from the current's mean position. The AC passes offshore and an ACM can reach offshore. When the AC meanders, its width broadens from to and its velocity weakens from to . An ACM induces a strong inshore counter-current. Large-scale cyclonic meanders known as Natal pulses are formed as the Agulhas Current reaches the continental shelf on the South African east-coast (i.e. the eastern Agulhas Bank off Natal). As these pulses moves along the coast on the Agulhas Bank, they tend to pinch off Agulhas rings from the Agulhas Current. Such a ring shedding can be triggered by a Natal pulse alone, but sometimes meanders on the Agulhas Return Current merge to contribute to the shedding of an Agulhas ring. Agulhas leakage and rings Light blue plankton in a wide anti-cyclonic (counter-clockwise) Agulhas ring, off the coast of South Africa. Such eddies, among the largest in the world, are peeled off the Agulhas Current on the eastern edge of the Agulhas Bank. Agulhas rings are large anticyclonic eddies or warm core rings of ocean water that are pinched off the Agulhas Current along the eastern edge of the Agulhas Bank from where they move into the South Atlantic. As the Agulhas Current reaches the east coast of South Africa, large solitary meanders known as Natal pulses form at irregular intervals. 165 days after the appearance of a Natal pulse, an Agulhas ring is formed off Durban. The Agulhas rings are among the largest eddies in the world and play an important role in the Agulhas Leakage, the transport of warm water from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, which affects the global climate. The average diameter of the Agulhas rings is , but they can reach 500 km. They extend down to the ocean floor; circulate at ; and move into the South Atlantic at /day. Only half of the Agulhas eddies that leave the Cape Basin manage to cross the Walvis Ridge and those that do tend to lose half their energy before reaching the ridge within six months. The Agulhas rings transport an estimated 1-5 Sv (millions m²/s) of water from the Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic. The Agulhas rings are thought to be of global climatic importance. Their delivery of warm water from the Indian to the Atlantic Ocean can control the rate of thermohaline overturning of the entire Atlantic. Other factors contribute to various degrees to the inter- ocean exchanges in the region, including filaments from the Agulhas Current and intrusions of water from Antarctica. Cold, cyclonic eddies have been observed in the southwestern Atlantic. Based on model simulations, researchers have found that the interaction of the Agulhas Current and the eastern edge of the bank can result in the Agulhas rings. The provenance of ocean sediments can be determined by analysing terrigenous strontium isotope ratios in deep ocean cores. Sediments underlying the Agulhas Current and Return Current have significantly higher ratios than surrounding sediments. Analyses of cores in the South Atlantic deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 20 000 years ago), show that the Agulhas leakage (shedding of Agulhas rings) was significantly reduced. It has been hypothesised that the reason for this was that the Agulhas Current was stronger which resulted in a more eastward retroflection and therefore less leakage. However, analyses of such cores south of Africa show that the trajectory of the current was the same during the LGM and that the reduced leakage must be explained by a weaker current. Consequently, it can be predicted that a stronger Agulhas Current will result in its retroflection occurring more eastward and an increased Agulhas leakage. =Benguela Current= Compared to the Agulhas Current, the Benguela Current on the west and south-west coast of Africa is more intense and steadier. Its dynamic southern upwelling system is driven by the prevailing northward winds that produce an intense off-shore Ekman transport. Most of this upwelling is concentrated to a few upwelling cells in the southern region: Namaqua (30°S), Cape Columbine (32.5°S), and Cape Peninsula (34°S). The wind is most intense from October to February, and the contrast in sea surface temperature between the open sea and the shelf is most prominent during summer. Coastal upwelling s also common on the western bank, but the more stable atmospheric condition results in larger cold water plumes that sometimes merge to form a continuous upwelling regime along the South African south-west coast. This upwelling zone is the southernmost extension of the Benguela Current Large Maritime Ecosystem. The Agulhas Current regularly flows around the southern tip of the bank and brings warm water to the western bank along the bank's western edge. Regularly, the mesoscale eddies from the east interact with the Benguela upwelling system on the African west coast. =Deep water eddies= Flowing south along the South American continental slope, the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) carries North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) into the South Atlantic. At about 8°S and at a depth of , the DWBC breaks into anticyclonic eddies during periods of strong meridional overturning circulation. One such NADW eddy was observed in 2003 and the researchers speculated that a deeply penetrating Agulhas ring pinched it off the NADW slope current. Spinning at , these deep-water eddies move around the southern tip of the Agulhas Bank and into the Indian Ocean. Most of the NADW flow (more than 7 Sv) meanders east around the Agulhas Plateau together with the surface Agulhas Return Current, but a smaller portion (3 Sv) continues north along the African east-coast as the Agulhas Undercurrent. Of 89.5 Sv released from the North Atlantic, 3.6 Sv leaves the South Atlantic south of the Agulhas Bank. However, 0.9 Sv recirculate in the basin north of the Walvis Ridge for centuries, of which 50-90% end up flowing south of the Agulhas Bank within 300 years, increasing the net inter-oceanic exchange with 4.1-4.5 Sv. = Alphard Banks = The Alphard Banks are a small group of long extinct volcanic seamounts on the Agulhas Bank south of Cape Agulhas. They rise from the bottom at about 80 m to about 14 m on the top. Geology The Agulhas Bank relative to the Agulhas Ridge, Basin, and Plateau As Gondwana formed 500 mya, a rift appeared which eventually developed into the Agulhas Sea. This sea filled with sediments that were to become the Cape Supergroup, which subsequently were folded into the Cape Fold Belt. The oldest rock found along the coastline of the Agulhas Bank are eugeosynclinal sediments of the up to thick Kaaimans Group deposited during continental rifting some 900 million years ago (Mya). The proto-South Atlantic closed during the Saldanian orogeny to form part of the supercontinent Gondwana (700-600 Mya). The Cape granites were emplaced and the Kaaimans Group rocks were folded and thermally metamorphosed during this period. The formation of the main basin in the Cape Province commenced 570 Mya and lasted for 200 My. The Table Mountain Group is thick and an erosional unconformity marking its base is composed of both terrestrial and marine sediments. Synclines along the coast of the southern Cape contains sediments from the Bokkveld Group. The Cape Fold Belt (CFB) rocks and the Karoo Basin were deposited 450 Mya; the Cape Supergroup 450-300 Mya during a series of transgression-regression cycles. Pan-African thrusts were reactivated 270-215 Mya to form the CFB which was then part of a continuous fold belt that developed during the Gondwanide orogeny together with Sierra de la Ventana (Argentina), Pensacola Mountains (East Antarctica), and Ellsworth Mountains (West Antarctica). In the late Carboniferous and early Jurassic, the Karoo Supergroup was deposited in the Karoo Basin north of where the CFB is located today, and covering nearly two-thirds of present-day South Africa. =Gondwana breakup= Basaltic lavas were extruded 183 Mya to form the Karoo large igneous province; a volcanism caused by the Bouvet hotspot which is linked to the Gondwana break-up. The Bouvet hotspot was located in or near present-day South Africa from the late Triassic 220 mya and until the Africa-Antarctica breakup 120 mya. The Bouvet hotspot track stretches south-east from the African continent, near the South Africa-Mozambique border, and east of the AFFZ down to Bouvet Island/Bouvet Triple Junction in the South Atlantic. 100 Mya, the region where the triple junction was located passed over the hotspot, resulting in a continuous eruption that lasted to about 94 Mya and the seafloor spreading that still separates Antarctica, Africa, and South America. The Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone (AFFZ) stretches across the South Atlantic. It is one of the largest and most spectacular fracture zones on Earth. It developed during the Early Cretaceous as West Gondwana (=South America) broke up from Africa. The AFFZ is characterized by a pronounced topographic anomaly, the Agulhas Ridge (41°S,16°E-43°S,9°E) which rises more than 2 km above the surrounding sea floor. The only equivalent in size are the neighbouring Diaz Ridge and the Falkland Escarpment. The Agulhas Ridge is unique because it was not formed during the continental breakup during the Cretaceous and because it separates oceanic crusts of different age, and not oceanic crust (~14 km thick) from continental crust (25 km thick). North of the AFFZ is the Outeniqua Basin which is a complex system of sub-basins separated from each other by faults and basement arches; there are several smaller fault-bounded sub-basins in the north (Bredasdorp, Infanta, Pletmos, Gamtoos, and Algoa) and a distinctively deeper sub-basin in the south (the South Outeniqua Basin.) The sedimentary fill of these basins developed as the northern edge of the Falkland Plateau separated from the South African southern margin during the early Cretaceous. The Diaz Marginal Ridge (DMR) separates these basins from the AFFZ. The DMR is buried under of sediments and sedimentary rocks and of this sedimentary material is undisturbed Cretaceous sediments younger than the oldest Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the Southern Outeniqua Basin. The DMR must therefore have formed after the initial West Gondwana breakup 130-90 Mya. The DMR probably formed when new, hot oceanic crust slid past old, cold continental crust and the contrast in temperatures induced a thermal uplift. As West Gondwana drifted away from Africa roughly 125 Myr, the South Atlantic seafloor formed between them and magnetic anomalies north of the AFFZ reflects phase of the seafloor spreading. South of the AFFZ traces can be found of how the Falkland Plateau and the Agulhas Bank moved relative to each other. On a modern map, the Falkland Plateau can still be rotated and fitted into the Natal Valley in the Indian Ocean east of South Africa. The Agulhas Plateau is located southeast of the shelf, separated from it by the Agulhas Passage (through which the Agulhas Current flows.) =Pliocene= One of the largest known slumps occurred on the south-eastern edge of the Agulhas Bank in the Pliocene or more recently. Stretching from a depth of , the so-called Agulhas slump is long, wide, and has a volume of . It is a composite slump with proximal and distal allochthonous sediment masses separated by a large glide plane scar. In the western part, the sediments are dammed by basement ridges, but, in the eastern part, they have spread into the Transkei Basin. A series of slump scarps along the western edge of the shelf are 18–2 Mya, but covered by younger sediments brought there by the Benguela upwelling. Human evolution Anatomically modern humans evolved around 200 kya. The genetic diversity in the human lineage is relatively low, which indicate one or several population bottlenecks late in our lineage. It has been estimated that the population was limited to perhaps 600 individuals during the MIS 6 glacial stage (195-125 kya), one of the longest cold periods in the Quaternary of Africa. A technological and behavioural revolution that occurred globally about 50 kya led to a cultural complexity which happened in South Africa around 120-70 kya. The Cape Floral Region is a thin coastal strip and a botanic hotspot which developed at the confluence of the Benguela Upwelling and Agulhas Current. According to what professor Curtis Marean calls the \\"Cape Floral Region – South Coast Model\\" for the origins of modern humans, the early hunter-gatherers survived on shellfish, as well as geophytes, fur seal, fish, seabirds, and wash-ups found on the exposed Agulhas Bank. The bank slopes into the sea and a reconstruction of how the coastline has changed over 440 kya shows that the coast during the Pleistocene was located as far as from the present coast. The present South African southern coastal plain (SCP) is still separated from the rest of Africa by the Cape Fold Belt. During glacial maxima the sea-level dropped . This not only left large parts of the Agulhas Bank exposed, which greatly expanded the area of the SCP, but it also reconnected the SCP to the rest of Africa by the shallow water shelves, which broke the isolation of the SCP. Modern humans evolved on the SCP and the fluctuation in sea-levels would have resulted in a significant variation in selective pressure. No fossil records are known from the now submerged shelf, but a series of key fossil sites along the coastal margin of the present SCP provide earliest traces of anatomically modern humans and the use of marine resources. Commercial importance South Africa began oil exploration on the Agulhas Bank in the 1980s. Of more than 200 offshore wells in South Africa, most are found on Bredasdorp Basin on the Agulhas Bank. =Fishery= The Agulhas Bank is also significant for fisheries who use demersal trawling, demersal longline fishing, and midwater trawl fishing on the bank. Squid and small pelagic fishes are also caught. Before the introduction of the EEZ, foreign fisheries used roch-hopper gear trawling on the bank. Most of the catches are short- lived shelf-zone pelagic species and more long-lived deep-water species. The large populations of sardine and anchovy also present on the shelf follow an annual cycle. Anchovy spawn on the western Agulhas Bank in early summer while the sardines span over a broader season and area -- eggs are transported by currents to the nursery area in the St Helena Bay on the South African west coast from where juvenile then migrate back to the Agulhas Bank to spawn. South Africa has a relatively large fishing industry mostly catching pelagic pilchard and anchovy and demersal hake on the south and western coasts. Though the east coast has fewer commercial fisheries, the large human population along there has resulted in overexploitation of coastal fish and invertebrate stocks by recreational and subsistence fishers. A small aquaculture industry produces mussels and oysters offshore. Several pelagic species are heavily harvested by the commercial fleet: purse-seine fishery is used to catch sardines, anchovies, and round herring; mid-water trawl fishery to catch horse mackerel and chub mackerel; pelagic longline and pole fishery to catch tunas and swordfish; while hook and line are used inshore to catch squid and teleost species, including snoek and geelbek. All these species are relatively common and are considered having an important role in the ecosystem. Biodiversity Papery burnupena in False Bay There are at least 12,914 marine species in South Africa, but small bodied species are poorly documented and the abyssal zone is almost completely unexplored. Almost a quarter of South Africa's coast line is protected, excluding deeper water. A third of the marine species are endemic to South Africa (though poor levels of taxonomic research in adjoining countries probably affects the apparent endemism.) The degree of endemism varies considerably among taxa: Bryozoa 64%, Mollusca 56%, Echinodermata 3.6%, Porifera 8.8%, Amphipoda 33%, Isopoda 85%, or Cumacea 71%. Fisheries are one of the major threats to the biodiversity of the Agulhas Bank. =Crustaceans= Copepods comprise 90% of the zooplankton carbon on the Agulhas Bank, and are thus an important source of food for pelagic fish and juvenile squids. The population of Calanus agulhensis, a large species that dominates the copepod community in terms of biomass, has a center of distribution on the central Agulhas Bank. Since 1997 the copepod biomass on the central Agulhas Bank has declined significantly while the biomass of pelagic fish has increased significantly. While it is likely that predation has played an important role in the copepod decline, global warming (sea surface temperature and Cholorphyll A abundance) is believed to have contributed to a smaller population. =Fishes= A Great white shark near Dyer Island The shelf edge along the bank's southern tip is subject to sporadic upwelling. This slope and its surrounding seamounts are the spawning ground for sardine, anchovy, and horse mackerel. Eddies help transport water inshore and link the spawning habitat with important nursery areas. Eggs and larvae laid by the anchovy are transported via the Good Hope Jet to Africa's southwestern coast where they mature. Young anchovies then return to the Agulhas Bank to spawn. Young sardine and anchovy congregate along the west coast between March and September before they migrate to their spawning grounds on the Agulhas Bank. Sardines of intermediate age are present on the western Agulhas Bank between January and April before migrating to KwaZulu- Natal for winter. The spawning on the Agulhas Bank takes place offshore from September to February. The bank is the spawning area of deep reef fish species, including the threatened endemic red steenbras (Petrus rupestris). Other species have been overexploited, including daggerhead seabream or dageraad (Chrysoblephus cristiceps), black musselcracker (Cymatoceps nasutus), and silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus). 57 species of sharks have been reported off the western coast of South Africa, of which 21 are squaloid sharks. =Birds= Brown skua near Dyer Island African penguins at Table Mountain National Park The main food source for African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) is anchovy and sardine which they forage between Cape Columbine and the central Agulhas Bank. The birds have colonies on Dassen Island, on the South African west coast, and Bird Island, on the south coast. African penguins breed opportunistically, following the anchovy and sardine: from February to September on the Western Cape but from January to July on St Croix Island off Eastern Cape. After breeding, the birds forage further offshore: off the western coast and up to from their colonies off Eastern Cape. In 2005, when Korean and Philippine vessels started longline fishing along the edges of the Agulhas Bank, seabird bycatch became a huge problem. Large numbers of albatrosses and petrels were killed -- in average 0.6 birds per 1000 hooks, but up to 18 birds per 1000 hooks were reported. Since 2007, however, more restrictive permit conditions for foreign-flagged fleets and the use of birds scaring lines have decreased the number of killed birds by 85%. =Fur seals= A Cape fur seal diving off Cape Town Cape fur seals are present along the South African coast. Fur seals are protected in South Africa since 1893 although a small number are occasionally culled to protect sea birds. Many seals are caught in fishery nets and boat propellers, but the seals are also regularly accused of stealing fish from the fisheries. Sharks are known to prey on them, but in 2012 a cape fur seal was observed preying on and consuming a mid-sized blue shark. =Cetaceans= A dusky dolphin on the Cape Peninsula west coast 51 species, or more than 50%, of the recognized species of cetaceans are present in the southern African subregion (between the equator and the Antarctic ice edge), of which 36 have been sighted in South African and Namibian waters. A vulnerable population of fish-eating killer whales are present offshore on the Agulhas Bank. Observations peak in January while few are sighted in April and May. The killer whales move in pods of 1-4 individuals and are mostly sited over the shelf edge off the south-east coast. An analysis of killer whale mtDNA has shown that there was a peak inter- oceanic migration events during the Eemian interglacial period, 131-114 kya. This peak coincides with a period of maximal Agulhas leakage which promoted a rapid and episodic interchange of killer whale lineages. During this period killer whales and other marine top predators, such as the great white shark, colonised the North Atlantic and Mediterranean by following their prey -- bluefin tuna and swordfish. A vagrant Commerson's dolphin -- a species with two isolated populations, one along the southern coast of Argentina and the other around the Kerguelen Islands -- was sighted on the Agulhas Bank in 2004. It is not known from which population the sighted individual stems. The Kerguelen Islands are located and South America from the Agulhas Bank, but the west-ward direction of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current would force the dolphin to swim against the current from the Kerguelen Islands. Fossil beaked whales have been recovered by trawling from the seafloor off South Africa. Stranded pygmy sperm whales have been recorded on both the east and west coasts of South Africa.

An actor portraying Alexander Graham Bell speaking into an early model telephone The master telephone patent, 174465, granted to Bell, March 7, 1876 The invention of the telephone was the culmination of work done by many individuals, and led to an array of lawsuits relating to the patent claims of several individuals and numerous companies.  Early development  The concept of the telephone dates back to the string telephone or lover's telephone that has been known for centuries, comprising two diaphragms connected by a taut string or wire. Sound waves are carried as mechanical vibrations along the string or wire from one diaphragm to the other. The classic example is the tin can telephone, a children's toy made by connecting the two ends of a string to the bottoms of two metal cans, paper cups or similar items. The essential idea of this toy was that a diaphragm can collect voice sounds from the voice sounds for reproduction at a distance. One precursor to the development of the electromagnetic telephone originated in 1833 when Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber invented an electromagnetic device for the transmission of telegraphic signals at the University of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony, helping to create the fundamental basis for the technology that was later used in similar telecommunication devices. Gauss's and Weber's invention is purported to be the world's first electromagnetic telegraph.

Retrieved January 22, 2013. = Charles Grafton Page = In 1840, American Charles Grafton Page passed an electric current through a coil of wire placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. He observed that connecting and disconnecting the current caused a ringing sound in the magnet. He called this effect \\"galvanic music\\". = Innocenzo Manzetti = Innocenzo Manzetti considered the idea of a telephone as early as 1844, and may have made one in 1864, as an enhancement to an automaton built by him in 1849. = Charles Bourseul = Charles Bourseul was a French telegraph engineer who proposed (but did not build) the first design of a \\"make-and-break\\" telephone in 1854. That is about the same time that Meucci later claimed to have created his first attempt at the telephone in Italy. Bourseul explained: \\"Suppose that a man speaks near a movable disc sufficiently flexible to lose none of the vibrations of the voice; that this disc alternately makes and breaks the currents from a battery: you may have at a distance another disc which will simultaneously execute the same vibrations.... It is certain that, in a more or less distant future, a speech will be transmitted by electricity. I have made experiments in this direction; they are delicate and demand time and patience, but the approximations obtained promise a favorable result.\\" = Johann Philipp Reis = A stamp dedicated to Johann Philipp Reis The Reis telephone was developed from 1857 on. Allegedly, the transmitter was difficult to operate, since the relative position of the needle and the contact were critical to the device's operation. Thus, it can be called a \\"telephone\\", since it did transmit voice sounds electrically over distance, but was hardly a commercially practical telephone in the modern sense. Thomas Edison tested the Reis equipment and found that \\"single words, uttered as in reading, speaking and the like, were perceptible indistinctly, notwithstanding here also the inflections of the voice, the modulations of interrogation, wonder, command, etc., attained distinct expression.\\"Coe, page 23 In 1874, the Reis device was tested by the British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC). The results also confirmed it could transmit and receive speech with good quality (fidelity), but relatively low intensity. At the time STC was bidding Bell's American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and the results were covered up by STC's chairman Sir Frank Gill to maintain Bell's reputation. = Antonio Meucci = An early voice communicating device was invented around 1854 by Antonio Meucci, who called it a teletrofono. In 1871 Meucci filed a caveat at the US Patent Office. His caveat describes his invention, but does not mention a diaphragm, electromagnet, conversion of sound into electrical waves, conversion of electrical waves into sound, or other essential features of an electromagnetic telephone. Antonio Meucci, c.1880 The first American demonstration of Meucci's invention took place in Staten Island, New York in 1854. In 1861, a description of it was reportedly published in an Italian- language New York newspaper, although no known copy of that newspaper issue or article has survived to the present day. Meucci claimed to have invented a paired electromagnetic transmitter and receiver, where the motion of a diaphragm modulated a signal in a coil by moving an electromagnet, although this was not mentioned in his 1871 U.S. patent caveat. A further discrepancy observed was that the device described in the 1871 caveat employed only a single conduction wire, with the telephone's transmitter-receivers being insulated from a 'ground return' path. In the 1880s Meucci was credited with the early invention of inductive loading of telephone wires to increase long- distance signals. Unfortunately, serious burns from an accident, a lack of English, and poor business abilities resulted in Meucci's failing to develop his inventions commercially in America. Meucci demonstrated some sort of instrument in 1849 in Havana, Cuba, however, this may have been a variant of a string telephone that used wire. Meucci has been further credited with the invention of an anti-sidetone circuit. However, examination showed that his solution to sidetone was to maintain two separate telephone circuits and thus use twice as many transmission wires. The anti-sidetone circuit later introduced by Bell Telephone instead canceled sidetone through a feedback process. An American District Telegraph (ADT) laboratory reportedly lost some of Meucci's working models, his wife reportedly disposed of others and Meucci, who sometimes lived on public assistance, chose not to renew his 1871 teletrofono patent caveat after 1874. A resolution was passed by the United States House of Representatives in 2002 that said Meucci did pioneering work on the development of the telephone.House Resolution 269Wheen, Andrew.

The resolution said that \\"if Meucci had been able to pay the $10 fee to maintain the caveat after 1874, no patent could have been issued to Bell.\\" The Meucci resolution by the US Congress was promptly followed by a Canada legislative motion by Canada's 37th Parliament, declaring Alexander Graham Bell as the inventor of the telephone. Others in Canada disagreed with the Congressional resolution, some of whom provided criticisms of both its accuracy and intent.  Chronology of Meucci's invention  A retired director general of the Telecom Italia central telecommunications research institute (CSELT), Basilio Catania,Basilio Catania Homepage and the Italian Society of Electrotechnics, \\"Federazione Italiana di Elettrotecnica\\", have devoted a Museum to Antonio Meucci, constructing a chronology of his invention of the telephone and tracing the history of the two legal trials involving Meucci and Alexander Graham Bell.L'invenzione del telefono da parte di Meucci e la sua sventurata e ingiusta conclusioneMeucci, ChezBasilio.org websiteaei.it website They claim that Meucci was the actual inventor of the telephone, and base their argument on reconstructed evidence. What follows, if not otherwise stated, is a summary of their historic reconstruction.Basilio Catania's reconstruction, in English * In 1834 Meucci constructed a kind of acoustic telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre \\"Teatro della Pergola\\" in Florence. This telephone is constructed on the model of pipe- telephones on ships and is still working.Picture of the acoustic telephone, page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics * In 1848 Meucci developed a popular method of using electric shocks to treat rheumatism. He used to give his patients two conductors linked to 60 Bunsen batteries and ending with a cork. He also kept two conductors linked to the same Bunsen batteries. He used to sit in his laboratory, while the Bunsen batteries were placed in a second room and his patients in a third room. In 1849 while providing a treatment to a patient with a 114V electrical discharge, in his laboratory Meucci heard his patient's scream through the piece of copper wire that was between them, from the conductors he was keeping near his ear. His intuition was that the \\"tongue\\" of copper wire was vibrating just like a leaf of an electroscope; which means that there was an electrostatic effect. In order to continue the experiment without hurting his patient, Meucci covered the copper wire with a piece of paper. Through this device he heard inarticulated human voice. He called this device \\"telegrafo parlante\\" (litt. \\"talking telegraph\\").Meucci's original drawings. Page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics * On the basis of this prototype, Meucci worked on more than 30 kinds of sound transmitting devices inspired by the telegraph model as did other pioneers of the telephone, such as Charles Bourseul, Philipp Reis, Innocenzo Manzetti and others. Meucci later claimed that he did not think about transmitting voice by using the principle of the telegraph \\"make-and-break\\" method, but he looked for a \\"continuous\\" solution that did not interrupt the electric current. * Meucci later claimed that he constructed the first electromagnetic telephone, made of an electromagnet with a nucleus in the shape of a horseshoe bat, a diaphragm of animal skin, stiffened with potassium dichromate and keeping a metal disk stuck in the middle. The instrument was hosted in a cylindrical carton box.Meucci's original drawings. Page maintained by the Italian Society of Electrotechnics He said he constructed this as a way to connect his second-floor bedroom to his basement laboratory, and thus communicate with his wife who was an invalid. * Meucci separated the two directions of transmission in order to eliminate the so-called \\"local effect\\", adopting what we would call today a 4-wire-circuit. He constructed a simple calling system with a telegraphic manipulator which short-circuited the instrument of the calling person, producing in the instrument of the called person a succession of impulses (clicks), much more intense than those of normal conversation. As he was aware that his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called \\"skin effect\\" through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron). He successfully used an insulated copper plait, thus anticipating the litz wire used by Nikola Tesla in RF coils. * In 1864 Meucci later claimed that he realized his \\"best device\\", using an iron diaphragm with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was housed in a shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm. * In August 1870, Meucci later claimed that he obtained transmission of articulate human voice at a mile distance by using as a conductor a copper plait insulated by cotton. He called his device \\"teletrofono\\". Drawings and notes by Antonio Meucci dated September 27, 1870, show coils of wire on long-distance telephone lines.Affidavit of lawyer Michael Lemmi The painting made by Nestore Corradi :it:Nestore Corradi in 1858 mentions the sentence \\"Electric current from the inductor pipe\\" The above information was published in the Scientific American Supplement No. 520 of December 19, 1876,Scientific American Supplement No. 520, December 19, 1885 based on reconstructions produced in 1885, for which there was no contemporary pre-1875 evidence. Meucci's 1871 caveat did not mention any of the telephone features later credited to him by his lawyer, and which were published in that Scientific American Supplement, a major reason for the loss of the 'Bell v. Globe and Meucci' patent infringement court case, which was decided against Globe and Meucci.Meucci's 1871 patent caveat, pages 16-18 See Antonio Meucci – Patent caveat, for the full printed text of his 1871 teletrofono patent caveat. = Cyrille Duquet = Cyrille Duquet invents the handset.DUQUET, Cyrille  Electro-magnetic transmitters and receivers  = Elisha Gray = Elisha Gray, of Highland Park, Illinois, also devised a tone telegraph of this kind about the same time as La Cour. In Gray's tone telegraph, several vibrating steel reeds tuned to different frequencies interrupted the current, which at the other end of the line passed through electromagnets and vibrated matching tuned steel reeds near the electromagnet poles. Gray's 'harmonic telegraph,' with vibrating reeds, was used by the Western Union Telegraph Company. Since more than one set of vibration frequencies – that is to say, more than one musical tone – can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, the harmonic telegraph can be utilized as a 'multiplex' or many-ply telegraph, conveying several messages through the same wire at the same time. Each message can either be read by an operator by the sound, or from different tones read by different operators, or a permanent record can be made by the marks drawn on a ribbon of traveling paper by a Morse recorder. On July 27, 1875, Gray was granted U.S. patent 166,096 for \\"Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones\\" (the harmonic) On February 14, 1876, at the US Patent Office, Gray's lawyer filed a patent caveat for a telephone on the very same day that Bell's lawyer filed Bell's patent application for a telephone. The water transmitter described in Gray's caveat was strikingly similar to the experimental telephone transmitter tested by Bell on March 10, 1876, a fact which raised questions about whether Bell (who knew of Gray) was inspired by Gray's design or vice versa. Although Bell did not use Gray's water transmitter in later telephones, evidence suggests that Bell's lawyers may have obtained an unfair advantage over Gray.Inventors Digest, July/August 1998, p. 26-28 = Alexander Graham Bell = Bell's March 11 1876, laboratory notebook entry describing his first successful experiment with the telephone Alexander Graham Bell had pioneered a system called visible speech, developed by his father, to teach deaf children. In 1872 Bell founded a school in Boston to train teachers of the deaf. The school subsequently became part of Boston University, where Bell was appointed professor of vocal physiology in 1873. As Professor of Vocal Physiology at Boston University, Bell was engaged in training teachers in the art of instructing the deaf how to speak and experimented with the Leon Scott phonautograph in recording the vibrations of speech. This apparatus consists essentially of a thin membrane vibrated by the voice and carrying a light-weight stylus, which traces an undulatory line on a plate of smoked glass. The line is a graphic representation of the vibrations of the membrane and the waves of sound in the air.Robert Bruce (1990), pages 102–103, 110–113, 120–121 This background prepared Bell for work with spoken sound waves and electricity. He began his experiments in 1873–1874 with a harmonic telegraph, following the examples of Bourseul, Reis, and Gray. Bell's designs employed various on-off-on-off make-break current-interrupters driven by vibrating steel reeds which sent interrupted current to a distant receiver electro-magnet that caused a second steel reed or tuning fork to vibrate.Robert Bruce (1990), pages 104–109 During a June 2, 1875, experiment by Bell and his assistant Thomas Watson, a receiver reed failed to respond to the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was at the other end of the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate.Robert Bruce (1990), pages 146–148 A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, it occurred to him that since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance. After Bell and Watson discovered on June 2, 1875, that movements of the reed alone in a magnetic field could reproduce the frequencies and timbre of spoken sound waves, Bell reasoned by analogy with the mechanical phonautograph that a skin diaphragm would reproduce sounds like the human ear when connected to a steel or iron reed or hinged armature. On July 1, 1875, he instructed Watson to build a receiver consisting of a stretched diaphragm or drum of goldbeater's skin with an armature of magnetized iron attached to its middle, and free to vibrate in front of the pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line. A second membrane-device was built for use as a transmitter.Robert Bruce (1990), page 149 This was the \\"gallows\\" phone. A few days later they were tried together, one at each end of the line, which ran from a room in the inventor's house, located at 5 Exeter Place in Boston, to the cellar underneath. Bell, in the work room, held one instrument in his hands, while Watson in the cellar listened at the other. Bell spoke into his instrument, \\"Do you understand what I say?\\" and Watson answered \\"Yes\\". However, the voice sounds were not distinct and the armature tended to stick to the electromagnet pole and tear the membrane. In a March 10, 1876, test, between two rooms in a single building in Boston showed that the telephone worked, but so far, only at a short range.American Treasures of the Library of Congress ... Bell - Lab notebook In 1876, Bell became the first to obtain a patent for an \\"apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically\\", after experimenting with many primitive sound transmitters and receivers. Because of illness and other commitments, Bell made little or no telephone improvements or experiments for eight months until after his U.S. patent 174,465 was published., but within a year the first telephone exchange was built in Connecticut and the Bell Telephone Company was created in 1877, with Bell the owner of a third of the shares, quickly making him a wealthy man. The master telephone patent, 174465, granted to Bell, March 7, 1876 In 1880, Bell was awarded the French Volta Prize for his invention and with the money, founded the Volta Laboratory in Washington, where he continued experiments in communication, in medical research, and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf, working with Helen Keller among others. In 1885 he acquired land in Nova Scotia and established a summer home there where he continued experiments, particularly in the field of aviation. Bell himself claimed that the telephone was invented in Canada but made in the United States.https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innovations/023020-3020-e.html = Bell's success = Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent drawing, March 7, 1876 Telephone Centennial Issue of 1976 The first successful bi-directional transmission of clear speech by Bell and Watson was made on March 10, 1876, when Bell spoke into the device, \\"Mr. Watson, come here, I want to see you.\\" and Watson complied with the request. Bell tested Gray's liquid transmitter designShulman, pages 36-37. Bell's lab notes dated March 9, 1876 show a drawing of a person speaking face down into a liquid transmitter very similar to the liquid transmitter depicted as Fig. 3 in Gray's caveat. in this experiment, but only after Bell's patent was granted and only as a proof of concept scientific experimentEvenson, page 99. to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible \\"articulate speech\\" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.Evenson, page 98. Because a liquid transmitter was not practical for commercial products, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone after March 1876 and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.Evenson, page 100. Bell's telephone transmitter (microphone) consisted of a double electromagnet, in front of which a membrane, stretched on a ring, carried an oblong piece of soft iron cemented to its middle. A funnel-shaped mouthpiece directed the voice sounds upon the membrane, and as it vibrated, the soft iron \\"armature\\" induced corresponding currents in the coils of the electromagnet. These currents, after traversing the wire, passed through the receiver which consisted of an electromagnet in a tubular metal can having one end partially closed by a thin circular disc of soft iron. When the undulatory current passed through the coil of this electromagnet, the disc vibrated, thereby creating sound waves in the air. This primitive telephone was rapidly improved. The double electromagnet was replaced by a single permanently magnetized bar magnet having a small coil or bobbin of fine wire surrounding one pole, in front of which a thin disc of iron was fixed in a circular mouthpiece. The disc served as a combined diaphragm and armature. On speaking into the mouthpiece, the iron diaphragm vibrated with the voice in the magnetic field of the bar-magnet pole, and thereby caused undulatory currents in the coil. These currents, after traveling through the wire to the distant receiver, were received in an identical apparatus. This design was patented by Bell on January 30, 1877. The sounds were weak and could only be heard when the ear was close to the earphone/mouthpiece, but they were distinct. In the third of his tests in Southern Ontario, on August 10, 1876, Bell made a call via the telegraph line from the family homestead in Brantford, Ontario, to his assistant located in Paris, Ontario, some 13 kilometers away. This test was claimed by many sources as the world's first long-distance call. The final test certainly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.  Public demonstrations  = Early public demonstrations of Bell's telephone = Bell exhibited a working telephone at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in June 1876, where it attracted the attention of Brazilian emperor Pedro II plus the physicist and engineer Sir William Thomson (who would later be ennobled as the 1st Baron Kelvin). In August 1876 at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Thomson revealed the telephone to the European public. In describing his visit to the Philadelphia Exhibition, Thomson said, \\"I heard [through the telephone] passages taken at random from the New York newspapers: 'S.S. Cox Has Arrived' (I failed to make out the S.S. Cox); 'The City of New York', 'Senator Morton', 'The Senate Has Resolved To Print A Thousand Extra Copies', 'The Americans In London Have Resolved To Celebrate The Coming Fourth Of July!' All this my own ears heard spoken to me with unmistakable distinctness by the then circular disc armature of just such another little electro-magnet as this I hold in my hand.\\" = Three great tests of the telephone = The master telephone patent, 174465, granted to Bell, March 7, 1876 Only a few months after receiving U.S. Patent No. 174465 at the beginning of March 1876, Bell conducted three important tests of his new invention and the telephone technology after returning to his parents' home at Melville House (now the Bell Homestead National Historic Site) for the summer. On March 10, 1876 Bell had used \\"the instrument\\" in Boston to call Thomas Watson who was in another room but out of earshot. He said, \\"Mr. Watson, come here – I want to see you\\" and Watson soon appeared at his side. In the first test call at a longer distance in Southern Ontario, on August 3, 1876, Alexander Graham's uncle, Professor David Charles Bell, spoke to him from the Brantford telegraph office, reciting lines from Shakespeare's Hamlet (\\"To be or not to be....\\").\\"You Can Tour The House in Brantford Where Bell Worked on His Telephone\\", Toronto Daily Star, December 26, 1970.

The next day on August 4 another call was made between Brantford's telegraph office and Melville House, where a large dinner party exchanged \\"....speech, recitations, songs and instrumental music\\".

For that long-distance call Alexander Graham Bell set up a telephone using telegraph lines at Robert White's Boot and Shoe Store at 90 Grand River Street North in Paris via its Dominion Telegraph Co. office on Colborne Street. The normal telegraph line between Paris and Brantford was not quite 13 km (8 miles) long, but the connection was extended a further 93 km (58 miles) to Toronto to allow the use of a battery in its telegraph office.\\"First Telephone Office\\", CWB, November 17, 1971, pp. 4–5.\\"A .G. Bell's Brantford House Is Museum of the Telephone\\", Toronto Star, April 25, 1987, p. H-23. Granted, this was a one-way long-distance call. The first two-way (reciprocal) conversation over a line occurred between Cambridge and Boston (roughly 2.5 miles) on October 9, 1876. During that conversation, Bell was on Kilby Street in Boston and Watson was at the offices of the Walworth Manufacturing Company.First Phone Call 685 Main Street Scientific American described the three test calls in their September 9, 1876, article, \\"The Human Voice Transmitted by Telegraph\\". Historian Thomas Costain referred to the calls as \\"the three great tests of the telephone\\".\\"First Long Distance Telephone Call Recalled\\", Brantford Expositor, August 11, 1976. One Bell Homestead reviewer wrote of them, \\"No one involved in these early calls could possibly have understood the future impact of these communication firsts\\". = Later public demonstrations = A later telephone design was publicly exhibited on May 4, 1877, at a lecture given by Professor Bell in the Boston Music Hall. According to a report quoted by John Munro in Heroes of the Telegraph: > '' Going to the small telephone box with its slender wire attachments, Mr. > Bell coolly asked, as though addressing someone in an adjoining room, \\"Mr. > Watson, are you ready!\\" Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly > answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing \\"America\\". > [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty- > three miles distant, Mr. Bell listened a moment, and said, \\"Signor > Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now > sing for us.\\" In a moment the cadence of the tenor's voice rose and fell, > the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a > cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a > three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and Mr. Bell told his > audience \\"I will switch off the song from one part of the room to another so > that all can hear.\\" At a subsequent lecture in Salem, Massachusetts, > communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. > Watson at the latter place sang \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", the National Anthem, and > \\"Hail Columbia\\", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.\`Munro, > John. Heroes of the Telegraph, London: The Religious tract society, 1891. > Note: public domain text On January 14, 1878, at Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight, Bell demonstrated the device to Queen Victoria, placing calls to Cowes, Southampton and London. These were the first publicly witnessed long-distance telephone calls in the UK. The queen considered the process to be \\"quite extraordinary\\" although the sound was \\"quite faint\\". She later asked to buy the equipment that was used, but Bell offered to make a model specifically for her.  Summary of Bell's achievements  Bell did for the telephone what Henry Ford did for the automobile. Although not the first to experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. It can be argued that Bell invented the telephone industry. Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an electric wire was named an IEEE Milestone.  Variable resistance transmitters  = Water microphone – Elisha Gray = Elisha Gray recognized the lack of fidelity of the make-break transmitter of Reis and Bourseul and reasoned by analogy with the lover's telegraph, that if the current could be made to more closely model the movements of the diaphragm, rather than simply opening and closing the circuit, greater fidelity might be achieved. Gray filed a patent caveat with the US patent office on February 14, 1876, for a liquid microphone. The device used a metal needle or rod that was placed – just barely – into a liquid conductor, such as a water/acid mixture. In response to the diaphragm's vibrations, the needle dipped more or less into the liquid, varying the electrical resistance and thus the current passing through the device and on to the receiver. Gray did not convert his caveat into a patent application until after the caveat had expired and hence left the field open to Bell. When Gray applied for a patent for the variable resistance telephone transmitter, the Patent Office determined \\"while Gray was undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the (variable resistance) invention, as in his caveat of 14 February 1876, his failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had demonstrated the utility of the invention deprives him of the right to have it considered.\\"Burton Baker, pages 90–91 = Carbon microphone – Thomas Edison, Edward Hughes, Emile Berliner = The carbon microphone was independently developed around 1878 by David Edward Hughes in England and Emile Berliner and Thomas Edison in the US. Although Edison was awarded the first patent in mid-1877, Hughes had demonstrated his working device in front of many witnesses some years earlier, and most historians credit him with its invention. Thomas Alva Edison took the next step in improving the telephone with his invention in 1878 of the carbon grain \\"transmitter\\" (microphone) that provided a strong voice signal on the transmitting circuit that made long-distance calls practical. Edison discovered that carbon grains, squeezed between two metal plates, had a variable electrical resistance that was related to the pressure. Thus, the grains could vary their resistance as the plates moved in response to sound waves, and reproduce sound with good fidelity, without the weak signals associated with electromagnetic transmitters. The carbon microphone was further improved by Emile Berliner, Francis Blake, David E. Hughes, Henry Hunnings, and Anthony White. The carbon microphone remained standard in telephony until the 1980s, and is still being produced.  Improvements to the early telephone  Additional inventions such as the call bell, central telephone exchange, common battery, ring tone, amplification, trunk lines, and wireless phones – at first cordless and then fully mobile – made the telephone the useful and widespread apparatus as it is now. = Telephone exchanges = The telephone exchange was an idea of the Hungarian engineer Tivadar Puskás (1844–1893) in 1876, while he was working for Thomas Edison on a telegraph exchange. Puskás Tivadar (1844–1893) (short biography), Hungarian History website. Retrieved from Archive.org, February 2013. Puskás was working on his idea for an electrical telegraph exchange when Alexander Graham Bell received the first patent for the telephone. This caused Puskás to take a fresh look at his own work and he refocused on perfecting a design for a telephone exchange. He then got in touch with the U.S. inventor Thomas Edison who liked the design. According to Edison, \\"Tivadar Puskas was the first person to suggest the idea of a telephone exchange\\".Frank Lewis Dyer and Thomas Commerford Martin. Edison, His Life And Inventions, Harper & Brothers, 1910, p. 71. Retrieved from Gutenberg.org.  Controversies  Bell has been widely recognized as the \\"inventor\\" of the telephone outside of Italy, where Meucci was championed as its inventor. In the United States, there are numerous reflections of Bell as a North American icon for inventing the telephone, and the matter was for a long time non-controversial. In June 2002, however, the United States House of Representatives passed a symbolic bill recognizing the contributions of Antonio Meucci \\" _in_ the invention of the telephone\\" (not \\" _for_ the invention of the telephone\\"), throwing the matter into some controversy. Ten days later the Canadian parliament countered with a symbolic motion conferring official recognition for the invention of the telephone to Bell. Champions of Meucci, Manzetti, and Gray have each offered fairly precise tales of a contrivance whereby Bell actively stole the invention of the telephone from their specific inventor. In the 2002 congressional resolution, it was inaccurately noted that Bell worked in a laboratory in which Meucci's materials had been stored, and claimed that Bell must thus have had access to those materials. Manzetti claimed that Bell visited him and examined his device in 1865. And it is alleged that Bell bribed a patent examiner, Zenas Wilber, not only into processing his application before Gray's, but allowing a look at his rival's designs before final submission. One of the valuable claims in Bell's 1876 was claim 4, a method of producing variable electric current in a circuit by varying the resistance in the circuit. That feature was not shown in any of Bell's patent drawings, but was shown in Elisha Gray's drawings in his caveat filed the same day, February 14, 1876. A description of the variable resistance feature, consisting of seven sentences, was inserted into Bell's application. That it was inserted is not disputed. But when it was inserted is a controversial issue. Bell testified that he wrote the sentences containing the variable resistance feature before January 18, 1876, \\"almost at the last moment\\" before sending his draft application to his lawyers. A book by EvensonEvenson, pp 64–69, 86–87, 110, 194–196 argues that the seven sentences and claim 4 were inserted, without Bell's knowledge, just before Bell's application was hand carried to the Patent Office by one of Bell's lawyers on February 14, 1876. Contrary to the popular story, Gray's caveat was taken to the US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to the Patent Office in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after the Patent Office opened and remained near the bottom of the in- basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts blotter and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash blotter and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier.Evenson, pages 68–69 Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.  Memorial to the invention  In 1906 the citizens of the City of Brantford, Ontario, Canada and its surrounding area formed the Bell Memorial Association to commemorate the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in July 1874 at his parents’ home, Melville House, near Brantford. Whitaker, A.J. Bell Telephone Memorial, City of Brantford/Hurley Printing, Brantford, Ontario, 1944. Osborne, Harold S. (1943) Biographical Memoir of Alexander Graham Bell, National Academy of Sciences: Biographical Memoirs, Vol. XXIII, 1847–1922. Presented to the Academy at its 1943 annual meeting. Walter Allward's design was the unanimous choice from among 10 submitted models, winning the competition. The memorial was originally to be completed by 1912 but Allward did not finish it until five years later. The Governor General of Canada, Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, ceremoniously unveiled the memorial on October 24, 1917. Allward designed the monument to symbolize the telephone's ability to overcome distances. A series of steps lead to the main section where the floating allegorical figure of Inspiration appears over a reclining male figure representing Man, discovering his power to transmit sound through space, and also pointing to three floating figures, the messengers of Knowledge, Joy, and Sorrow positioned at the other end of the tableau. Additionally, there are two female figures mounted on granite pedestals representing Humanity positioned to the left and right of the memorial, one sending and the other receiving a message. The Bell Telephone Memorial's grandeur has been described as the finest example of Allward's early work, propelling the sculptor to fame. The memorial itself has been used as a central fixture for many civic events and remains an important part of Brantford's history, helping the city style itself as 'The Telephone City'. The alt=A majestic, broad monument with figures mounted on pedestals to its left and right sides. Along the main portion of the monument are five figures mounted on a broad casting, including a man reclining, plus four floating female figures representing Inspiration, Knowledge, Joy, and Sorrow.

During the American Civil War, Baldwin believed his primary loyalty was to his state, and served as one of Virginia's representatives to the First and Second Confederate Congresses. He became one of the leading critics of President Jefferson Davis, who was seen by many as usurping the Confederacy's states' rights principles. During Congressional Reconstruction, Baldwin became Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates.http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Baldwin_John_Brown_1820-1873#start_entryCynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. xv, xxx, 416, 474, 500 Early and family life Baldwin was born on January 11, 1820 at Spring Farm near Staunton, Virginia to Virginia delegate and future Court of Appeals judge Briscoe Gerald Baldwin and his wife Martha Steele Brown Baldwin. He had three sisters--Frances Cornelia Baldwin Stuart (1815-1885), Mary Eleanor Baldwin Ranson (1817-1880) and Margaret E. Baldwin Stuart (1823-1844), as well as a brother, Briscoe Gerard Baldwin Jr. (1828-1898). J.B. Baldwin graduated from Staunton Academy and then the University of Virginia in 1838. He was a member of the college's Board of Visitors from 1856-64.J. Lewis Peyton, History of Augusta County, Virginia (Harrisonburg 1985 including Charles R. Carter's revisedindex) p. 379 He married Susan Madison Peyton, daughter of lawyer John Howe Peyton, on July 4, 1852, and after her death married Ann Lewis. Career Baldwin read law under his father (who was elected to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in 1842) , then joined the law practice of his brother-in-law Alexander H. H. Stuart, although Baldwin ultimately established his own solo practice after becoming politically active. =Prewar politics= At age 24, he substituted for his Whig law partner Alexander H.H. Stuart during a debate before the 1844 election. During the next election, local Augusta County voters elected Baldwin to the Virginia House of Delegates (a part time position), and he served from 1845-1846, but was defeated by Whig Hugh W. Sheffey after one term, and resumed his law practice full time (although remaining politically active). In 1859, Baldwin narrowly missed election to the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, William J. Robertson of Charlottesville being elected instead by the legislators. During the Presidential Election of 1860, Baldwin canvassed for John Bell, the Constitutional Unionist candidate, who won in Virginia but drew far fewer electoral college votes than either Republican Abraham Lincoln or Democrat Stephen A. Douglas. Augusta County voters elected Baldwin, his brother in law, law partner and fellow Unionist Alexander H.H. Stuart and Unionist Democrat George Baylor to the Virginia Secession Convention, which began on February 13, 1861. On March 21, Baldwin began a pro-Union speech which lasted three days. On April 4, 1861, Baldwin represented the Convention's Unionist leadership at a secret one-hour interview with President Abraham Lincoln at the White House. He went to Washington hopeful that an agreement might be reached that would preserve the peace and hold Virginia in the Union. However, he returned to Richmond empty- handed, after finding that he and Lincoln had talked past each other.Daniel W. Crofts, Reluctant Confederates: Upper South Unionists in the Secession Crisis (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1989), 301-6. President Lincoln also separately met with another Unionist, John Minor Botts, who later blamed Baldwin for failing to publicize Lincoln's peace offer.http://edu.lva.virginia.gov/online_classroom/union_or_secession/people/john_botts The Unionists had temporarily managed to avoid secession while Baldwin met with Lincoln, but their majority collapsed shortly after his return to Richmond.http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Baldwin_John_Brown_1820-1873#start_entry =Confederate service= When the Convention decided upon secession, Baldwin's loyalty remained with his home state.

Biography  Born of a French father who originated from the Charent region in France and a Belgian mother, Paul Nougé attended a French school in Brussels studying Biological Chemistry and worked as a Biochemist in a medical laboratory from 1919 to 1953. He became a founding member of the first Belgian Communist Party in 1919. In November 1924 he created the journal Correspondance, which published 26 pamphlets up to September 1925, in collaboration with Camille Goemans and Marcel Lecomte. In July 1925 he was expelled from the party. That same year Nougé met the French surrealists, Louis Aragon, André Breton and Paul Éluard, and together they signed the tract \\"La Révolution d'abord et toujours\\" (The Revolution First and Forever). In 1926 he made the acquaintance of Louis Scutenaire, and September of that year marked the drafting of the constitution of the Belgian Surrealist Group that comprised Nougé, Goemans, René Magritte, E. L. T. Mesens and André Souris. In 1927 Nougé composed plagiarised examples of a grammar book of Clarisse Juranville, illustrated with five drawings by Magritte. In 1928 he founded the magazine Distances and wrote the poem catalogue of a fur trader that was illustrated by Magritte entitled Le catalogue Samuel (re-edited by Didier Devillez, Brussels, 1996). He also wrote the preface of a Magritte exhibition at the gallery \\"L'époque\\" (signed by his 'accomplices' Goemans, Mesens, Lecomte, Scutenaire and Souris) and delivered in January 1929 to Charleroi – a conference on the accompanying music to a concert conducted by Souris and an exhibition of Magritte (\\"La conférence de Charleroi\\", published in 1946). Between December 1929 and February 1930 Nougé created 19 photographs, unpublished until 1968, under the title Subversion des images. These photographsBritish Journal of Art Retrieved 22 March 2011 have been displayed notably, and most recently, at the Edinburgh Art Festival 2009.Edinburgh Guide http://www.edinburghguide.com/photos/lajongleuse Retrieved 22 March 2011 In 1931 he wrote the preface to an exhibition which followed the return of Magritte to Brussels. Extracts from \\"Images défendues\\" were published in 1933 in issue number 5 of Surréalisme au service de la Révolution. In 1934 Nougé co-signed \\"L'action immédiate\\" in Documents 34, edited by Mesens. In 1935 \\"Le Couteau dans la plaie\\" ('The Knife in the Wound') was published and in 1936, René Magritte ou la révélation objective was published in \\"Les Beaux-Arts\\" in Brussels. In that same year, Nougé, along with Mesens, organised the exclusion of Souris from the group. Nougé was mobilised in 1939 in Mérignac then Biarritz, during World War II, as a military nurse. In 1941 Nougé prefaced an exhibition, quickly closed by the occupying forces, of photographs by Raoul Ubac in Brussels L'expérience souveraine (The Sovereign Experience). In 1943 he published the complete text of René Magritte ou Les images défendues.

Her writing is characterized by an experimental style which questions hierarchical social structures from a feminist perspective.Sharon Magnarelli, Reflections/Refractions, Reading Luisa Valenzuela (New York/Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 1988). She is best known for her work written in response to the dictatorship of the 1970s in Argentina. Works such as Como en la guerra (1977), Cambio de armas (1982) and Cola de lagartija (1983) combine a powerful critique of dictatorship with an examination of patriarchal forms of social organization and the power structures which inhere in human sexuality and gender relationships.Juana María Cordones-Cook, Poética de la transgresión en la novelística de Luisa Valenzuela (New York/Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 1991).Elia Geoffrey Kantaris, The Subversive Psyche: Contemporary Women's Narrative from Argentina and Uruguay (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995). Biography Luisa Valenzuela was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on November 26, 1938, to Pablo Franciso Valenzuela, a physician, and to writer Luisa Mercedes Levinson. At her mother's house various writers gathered such as Adolfo Bioy Casares, Jorge Luis Borges and Ernesto Sabato. Though she felt an interest in natural sciences from an early age, at 17 she began publishing in several newspapers, such as Atlántida, El Hogar and Esto Es, and worked for Radio Belgrano, as well. At 20, just barely married to Theodore Marjak, a French merchant marine, she moved to Paris where she worked for Radio Télévision Française, and met members of both the nouveau roman literary movement and Tel Quel. She published her first fiction work entitled Clara (Hay que sonreír), whose main character would give its name to the title of the book of both English and French translations. In 1958, Luisa Valenzuela gave birth to her daughter Anna-Luisa. In 1961 she moved back to Argentina, where she worked as a journalist for La Nación and Crisis magazine. In 1965 she got divorced. During 1967 and 1968 she traveled throughout Bolivia, Peru and Brazil working for La Nación. In 1969 she obtained the Fulbright Scholarship to study at the University of Iowa where she wrote The Efficient Cat (El gato eficaz). Between 1972 and 1974 she lived in Mexico City, Paris and Barcelona, with a brief stay in New York, where she researched the expression of the marginal United States literature as a recipient of the scholarship awarded by Argentina's National Fund for the Arts (Fondo Nacional de las Artes). As a consequence of the National Reorganization Process, that partially censored her novel He Who Searches (Como en la guerra) by removing a torture scene, she moved to the United States where she lived for ten years. There she published in 1982 her short fiction book Change of Guard (Cambio de armas) and in 1983 The Lizard's Tail (Cola de lagartija), a novel about José López Rega, Minister of Social Welfare during María Estela Martínez's presidency that was supposed to be originally titled as Red Ant Sorcerer, Lord of Tacurú and Her Sister Estrella (El Brujo Hormiga Roja, Señor del Tacurú y su Hermana Estrella). Luisa Valenzuela was a Resident Writer at the Center for Interamerican Relations at New York and Columbia University, where she taught writing workshops and seminars for ten years. She was a member of the New York Institute for the Humanities, at the Fund for Free Expression and member of the Freedom to Write Committee of the PEN American Center. In 1983 she was awarded the Guggenheim Scholarship. In 1989 she returned to Buenos Aires, where she finished her fiction works National Reality from Bed (Realidad nacional desde la cama), conceived initially as a play but finished as a novel and Black novel with Argentines (Novela negra con argentinos) that originally was meant to bear the title of The Motive (El motivo).

The neighborhood is gentrifying and attracting new families, empty-nesters, Atlantans opposed to long commutes; as well as diverse culture of first-time homebuyers, single professionals, artist and students due to its close proximity to other nearby intown neighborhoods, high walkability index, urban amenities and nearby bohemian hotspots on Carroll Street in the adjoined-at-the-hip also historic Cabbagetown neighborhood \\"Creative Loafing\\" Neighborhood Guide and in other surrounding communities.  Crime  The CRiSP - Cabbagetown/Reynoldstown Security Patrol was founded by a small group of concerned Cabbagetown residents who wanted to be proactive about fighting crime in their community and was later joined by residents of Reynoldstown. CRiSP provides additional police and private security presence in Reynoldstown and Cabbagetown, helping to make the communities safer and to improve the quality of life for residents and visitors.  Geography  Reynoldstown is bordered on the west by Pearl Street, across which is Cabbagetown and, south of Memorial Drive, Grant Park; on the east by Moreland Avenue and Edgewood; on the south by I-20, across which is the Ormewood Park neighborhood and an industrial area which is officially part of Grant Park; and on the north by the railroad line and Inman Park. Reynoldstown lies in NPU N. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. Local landmarks include the Colgate Mattress Factory, Trees Atlanta headquarters and nursery, and the former Atlanta & West Point Railroad depot, which now houses a restaurant.  History and demographics  Reynoldstown is a community that was originally settled after the American Civil War by freed slaves who were employed by the railroad. Madison and Sarah Reynolds were among the first ex-slaves to move into the area, and it is believed that the neighborhood was named after them. Reynoldstown was annexed by the city of Atlanta in 1909 and celebrates its historic tie to freed slave roots and artistic expressions to empower residents with its annual Wheelbarrow Festival. The neighborhood continued to thrive and prosper until the 1950s when it was nearly 100% African-American populated, when the railroad industry began to decline. Reynoldstown began gentrifying in the 1990s, altering the demographic makeup of the neighborhood where today it is closer to a mix of 65% white and 35% African-American population composition. The neighborhood was listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Parks and trails The BeltLine bisects Reynoldstown north-south. It functions as a paved walking and biking trail, and possibly for transit use (either light rail or streetcar). Just north of Reynoldstown in Inman Park adjacent the intersection of Krog St and Irwin St, The East Side Trail, part of The Beltline, is paved from here to Piedmont Park through Inman Park, Old Fourth Ward, Poncey-Highland and Virginia-Highland. The CSX railroad Hulsey Yard forms the northern border of the neighborhood, a current issue is how to connect the southeast BeltLine to the Eastside Trail portion of the BeltLine across the yard. The southern wall of the yard on Wylie Street in Reynoldstown and Cabbagetown is a prominent location for street art in Atlanta. Lang-Carson Park ()City of Atlanta, Parks list also lies within Reynoldstown.  Transportation  Memorial Drive is the major thoroughfare passing through the south end of Reynoldstown, with mostly light industrial properties, many of which are now repurposed for residential, retail and entertainment use. Reynoldstown contains rail right-of-way that is planned for the Beltline. Reynoldstown is served by the Inman Park/Reynoldstown MARTA station.

In Princeton Borough 1,385 voted for, 902 voted against while in Princeton Township 3,542 voted for and 604 voted against. Proponents of the merger asserted that when the merger is completed the new municipality of Princeton will save $3.2 million as a result of some scaled- down services, including layoffs of 15 government workers, including 9 police officers (however, the measure itself does not mandate such layoffs). Opponents of the measure challenged the findings of the report, citing cost savings as unsubstantiated, and noted that voter representation would be reduced in a smaller government structure. The consolidation took effect on January 1, 2013. December 31, 2012 was the last day the Borough of Princeton existed as a municipality. =Federal, state and county representation= The Borough of Princeton was in the 12th Congressional district2011 New Jersey Citizen’s Guide to Government , p. 63, New Jersey League of Women Voters.

It is the sequel to the 1996 video game Formula 1 and was based on the 1997 Formula One World Championship. This was the last Formula One game to be made by the Bizarre Creations team, who moved on to create the successful Metropolis Street Racer for the Dreamcast and Project Gotham Racing for the Xbox. Features and gameplay The game includes a Grand Prix mode, which was designed to be technical and realistic, and an arcade mode, which was aimed towards a broader audience. Formula 1 97 supports two-player racing through a split screen. Development Formula 1 97 was developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Psygnosis. It uses the same game engine as the original Formula 1. Psygnosis contacted ITV commentator Murray Walker and arranged a meeting with Bizarre Creations employees. Walker became impressed with development and signed an exclusive agreement with Psygnosis to record English-language commentary for a further two years. Reception Formula 1 97 was a best-seller in the UK.Gallup UK PlayStation sales chart, December 1997, published in Official UK PlayStation Magazine issue 26 In August 1998, the game's PlayStation version received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Reviews for Formula 1 97 were overwhelmingly positive. IGN stated the game is a \\"significant jump\\" from Formula 1. GameSpot said \\"Formula 1 CE is so much more than a racing game. It is a world-class simulation that offers such depth of gameplay, you'll think most other racing games are just Pole Position with a better graphics engine.\\" Critics widely applauded the comprehensive Formula 1 licensing, numerous car setup options, realistic sound effects, and overall authentic Formula 1 feel. At the same time, the majority were enthusiastic about the arcade mode, saying it both opens the game up to players other than simulation fanatics and offers simulation fanatics a more relaxed way of enjoying the game. GamePro dissented on this point, contending that the arcade mode's \\"power-slide-heavy style feels almost silly and lacks the oomph to attract arcade gamers.\\" Critics laid the most praise on the controls in the Grand Prix mode, commenting that they are maximally accurate, realistic, and challenging yet fair and rewarding. GamePro summed up, \\"If you have the skills, they come shining through, but rookies will have a tough time staying on the track.\\" Most critics were also highly satisfied with the varied A.I. displayed by different drivers, saying it makes racing unpredictable and forces the player to pay close attention and continuously adjust their strategy rather than relying on a single method of overcoming opponents. Most critics also praised the detailed graphics. While they also noted a good deal of pop-up, GameSpot argued this was a necessary trade-off for the game's combination of high detail and absence of slowdown, and Kelly Rickards argued in Electronic Gaming Monthly, \\"Ironically, [the pop-up] adds realism as it's difficult to see far away in a real F1 car at speed.\\" Official UK PlayStation Magazine said it was a big improvement in every regard over the previous game, and that the \\"graphics engine is faster, running at 25 fps, even with a dozen cars on the screen. The increased detail is most apparent in Grand Prix mode. All the cars are now fully deformable, and stray bits of debris stay on the track. Prepare to be stunned.\\"F1 '97 review, Official UK PlayStation Magazine, Future Publishing, October 1997, issue 24, page 101 Legal issues The game was hit by legal wranglings with the FIA (Formula One's governing body) objecting to the use of the FIA logo on the game's packaging. The game was withdrawn from shops six weeks after its release. It was re-released without the offending logo, but the FIA were still unhappy. However, the FIA lost the court case, and the game continued to be sold without the logo.F1 Racing magazine, December 1997 issue, page 20, British edition as imported to America Another problem faced was the use of the name and image of then- Williams-F1-driver Jacques Villeneuve, after he had copyrighted both. The game shows a silhouette for the driver's image. Murray Walker refers to him as \\"Williams Numberone\\" or \\"The Canadian\\", however on the game menu, they list him as Driverone Williams; this problem is easily sidestepped by the addition of a driver name edit function. The game also has unused voice clips for Jacques Villeneuve, that can be found via hacking methods. This idea proved popular and re-appeared in Formula 1 98, but was not used for any of the following games. The driver name edit function is also used to enter codes to unlock the Aida, Adelaide, Silverstone (1960s look), a mirrored version of the original game's bonus track, and others, such as raining frogs and the cars having the ability to hover. All alcohol and tobacco sponsors are censored, for example trackside adverts saying Faster instead of Fosters, since such advertisements were illegal in some countries.

He starred as a comic actor during much of his career for various periods at the Adelphi Theatre and the Haymarket Theatre, managing the Haymarket from 1853 to 1877.

He studied law and was articled to a solicitor but turned to acting by age 19.The Times, 1 November 1879, p. 5 =Early career= Buckstone first joined a travelling troupe in 1821 as Gabriel in The Children in the Wood.New York Times obituary, p. 2, 1 November 1879 and toured for three years, mostly in the southeast of England. He found a mentor in Edmund Kean. He made his first London appearance, on 30 January 1823, at the Surrey Theatre, as Ramsay in The Fortunes of Nigel. In 1824 he joined that theatre and played Peter Smink in The Armistice with great success. He also began to write plays.Waddy, Frederick. Cartoon Portraits and Biographical Sketches of Men of the Day, Tinsley brothers: London (1873) Portrait of Buckstone His successes led to his engagement in 1827 at the Adelphi Theatre, where he remained as the leading low comedian until 1833. Buckstone's acting was described as \\"a union of shrewdness and drollery, with their interaction upon each other ... was irresistibly comic.\\"Marston, Westland. Our Recent Actors (Boston, 1888), vol. II, p. 90 Buckstone wrote most of his plays in the first half of his career, and many of these were produced at the Adelphi. As his acting career reached the height of its success, his playwriting output declined.Stedman, Jane W. \\"General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero\\", Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289–301, The Johns Hopkins University Press At the Adelphi, he appeared as Bobby Trot in his first really successful play, the melodrama Luke the Labourer (1827), which he had written in 1826. Other well known plays were Wreck Ashore (1830) and Forgery (1832) Perhaps the most successful of these early plays was his 1833 play, The Bravo, based on James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name. =Peak years= He first appeared at the Haymarket Theatre during the summer season in 1833, also writing plays for this theatre, including Ellen Wartham (1833). Another hit for the Haymarket was the drama Thirty Years of a Woman's Life. At that theatre, his acting was praised in The Housekeeper by Douglas Jerrold (1833), Pyramus and Thisbe, and in his own plays, Uncle John, Rural Felicity and Agnes de Vere (all in 1834). He stayed at the Haymarket until 1838, producing The Dream at Sea among other plays. In 1839–40 he returned to the Adelphi to write and star in a number of plays, including his extraordinarily successful play Jack Sheppard, based on the novel of the same name published that year by William Harrison Ainsworth. After his return from a visit to the United States in 1840, where he met with little success, Buckstone played in his own play, Married Life, at the Haymarket. He then appeared at several London theatres, among them the Lyceum, where he was Box at the first representation of Box and Cox, by John Maddison Morton, in 1847.Box and Cox There he also created the role of Bob, in Dion Boucicault's Old Heads and Young Hearts, and played several other memorable roles, including, Slowboy in Cricket on the Hearth, Dan in John Bull, MacDunnum of Dunnum in A School for Scheming, Scrub in The Beaux' Stratagem and Golightly in Lend Me Five Shillings, and several Shakespeare roles. For the Adelphi, he wrote The Green Bushes and The Flowers of the Forest, both in 1847. He also dramatised The Last Days of Pompeii. He returned to the Haymarket in 1848, writing and playing in An Alarming Sacrifice, Leap Year and A Serious Family. During this period, he memorably played Moses in Stirling Coyne's adaptation of The Vicar of Wakefield, Appleface in Jerrold's Catspaw, Shadowly Softhead in Lord Lytton's Not as Bad as We Seem and in many Shakespeare productions with Mr. and Mrs. Charles Kean. =Later years= Engaged at the Haymarket in 1877thumbright250px He became lessee of the Haymarket from 1853 to 1877. For this theatre, he continued to write plays and farces, though markedly fewer than before. As actor-manager of the Haymarket, he surrounded himself with an admirable and effective ensemble company, including Edward Askew Sothern, Henry Compton, Mr. and Mrs. Charles James Mathews and the Kendals. He produced the plays of James Planché, Thomas William Robertson, Tom Taylor, John Oxenford, H. J. Byron and W. S. Gilbert, as well as his own, and in most of these he acted. Buckstone's management made the Haymarket into the premier comedy theatre of the age. Buckstone's own gifts in comedy contributed much to the theatre's remarkable success. According to The Times, \\"Few men... have possessed to a greater extent the power of communicating the spirit of mirth to an audience. ... He was helped, too, in his vocation by remarkable physical attributes\\" and a peculiar, hilarious voice. In the 1850s, Buckstone produced An Unequal Match and Taylor's The Overland Route, A Hero of Romance by Westland Marston, and Home by Robertson. In 1862, Buckstone produced a 496-night run of Our American Cousin, with Sothern in his most famous role as Lord Dundreary. Robertson's David Garrick was a hit in 1864, also with Sothern in the title role. W. S. Gilbert premiered seven of his plays at the Haymarket during this time including his blank verse \\"fairy comedies\\" starring the Kendals, such as The Palace of Truth (1870), Pygmalion and Galatea (1871) and The Wicked World (1873). Buckstone also produced Gilbert's dramas, Charity (1874) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876), as well as his 1877 farce Engaged. In 1873 Buckstone introduced the innovation of matinées starting at 2.00 pm. By the mid-1870s, however, Buckstone's company was disbanding, and in 1877, ill and bankrupt after sustaining heavy losses, he gave up management of the theatre. =Personal life, death and ghost= Buckstone was first married in 1828 to Anne Maria Honeyman,Parish Register (marriages) of St John the Evangelist, Lambeth, 1828, p. 168, No.502; London Metropolitan Archives with whom he had at least five childrenParish Registers (births) of: St John the Evangelist, Lambeth; St Mary, Lambeth; Holy Trinity, Brompton; Caterham Church (Bishop's Transcripts); London Metropolitan Archives before she died in 1844.Register of Deaths Index, 1844 Q3, vol. 3, p. 89, General Register Office, London For many years, Buckstone was closely associated with the actress Fanny Copeland Fitzwilliam, who was widowed in 1852 and whom he was engaged to marry in 1854.

Lasting the whole day of 22 March 1849 and ending at dawn on 23 March, it resulted in a severe defeat and retreat of the Piedmontese (Sardinian) army. Overview An uneasy armistice made in 1848 between Austria and Sardinia lasted less than seven months, before Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, denounced the truce on 12 March 1849. The Austrian army took the military initiative in Lombardy. Under the command of Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky von Radetz, it seized the fortress town of Mortara. The seizure of Mortara led to a battle between Austrian and Piedmontese troops at Novara, west of Milan. 70,000 Austrian troops, superior in numbers and armament to the 45,000 Piedmontese, thoroughly routed their opponent as they had at the Battle of Custoza the previous year. Piedmont also suffered from a lack of support from the smaller Italian states. General Girolamo Ramorino was accused of disobeying orders before the Battle of Novara, and, that same year, he was executed. The Piedmontese were driven back to Borgomanero at the foot of the Alps, and the Austrian forces occupied Novara, Vercelli and Trino, with the road to the Piedmontese capital, Turin, lying open to them. Aftermath Albrecht Adam, Die Schlacht bei Novarra (The Battle of Novara), 1858 Austrian general Baron Julius von Haynau subdued Brescia, 54 miles NE of Milan, and Charles Albert abdicated in favor of his son Victor Emmanuel, who would later become the first king of a unified Italy. Friedrich Engels wrote \\"that, after this defeat, a revolution and proclamation of a republic in Turin is expected, arises from the fact that the attempt is being made to prevent it by the abdication of Charles Albert in favour of his eldest son.\\" A Piedmontese Republic was not created, though a Roman Republic had already been proclaimed in February, and there existed a Venetian Republic as well. Charles Albert exiled himself to Oporto, Portugal, and died shortly thereafter. A peace treaty was signed on 9 August. Piedmont was forced to pay an indemnity of 65 million francs to Austria. A reenactment of the battle occurs every year.Novara Risorgimentale 2007 The Austrian frigate Novara, which went on a round-the-world scientific expedition between 1857 and 1859, was named after this Austrian victory.The Austrian Imperial Frigate SMS Novara  References   External links  * Battle of Novara, Forces in the Field, lastoria.org Novara 1849 Novara 1849 Category:Conflicts in 1849 Category:1849 in Italy Category:1849 in the Austrian Empire Category:Novara Category:March 1849 events Category:Battles in Piedmont Category:Joseph Radetzky von Radetz ","title":"Battle of Novara (1849)"},{"id":"2193879","text":"Lucien-L'Allier station is a commuter rail terminal in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

For a force free field, the electric current density is either zero or parallel to the magnetic field. The name \\"force-free\\" comes from being able to neglect the force from the plasma. Basic equations  Neglecting the effects of gravity, the Navier–Stokes equation for a plasma, in steady state, reads 0=- abla p+\\\\mathbf{j}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}, where p is the thermal pressure, \\\\mathbf{B} is the magnetic field and \\\\mathbf{j} is the electric current. Assuming that the gas pressure p is small compared to the magnetic pressure, i.e., p\\\\ll B^2/2\\\\mu then the pressure term can be neglected. Here \\\\mu is the magnetic permeability of the plasma. Therefore, \\\\mathbf{j}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B} = 0. This equation implies that: \\\\mu_{0}\\\\mathbf{j}=\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{B}. e.g. the current density is either zero or parallel to the magnetic field, and where \\\\alpha is a spatial-varying function to be determined. Combining this equation with Maxwell's equations: abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\mu\\\\mathbf{j} abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{B}=0 and the vector identity: abla\\\\cdot( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B})=0 leads to a pair of equations for \\\\alpha and \\\\mathbf{B}: \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\cdot abla\\\\alpha=0, abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{B}. Physical examples In the corona of the Sun, the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure can locally be of order 0.01 or lower, and in these regions the magnetic field can be described as force-free. Mathematical limits  *If the current density is identically zero, then the magnetic field is potential, i.e. the gradient of a scalar magnetic potential. :In particular, if \\\\mathbf{j}=0 :then abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}=0 which implies that \\\\mathbf{B}= abla\\\\phi . :The substitution of this into one of Maxwell's equations, abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{B}=0 , results in Laplace's equation, : abla^2\\\\phi=0 , :which can often be readily solved, depending on the precise boundary conditions. ::This limit is usually referred to as the potential field case. *If the current density is not zero, then it must be parallel to the magnetic field, i.e., ::\\\\mu\\\\mathbf{j}=\\\\alpha \\\\mathbf{B} which implies that abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\alpha \\\\mathbf{B} , where \\\\alpha is some scalar function. ::then we have, from above, :: \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\cdot abla\\\\alpha=0 :: abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{B} , which implies that :: abla\\\\times( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B})= abla\\\\times(\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{B}) ::There are then two cases: :::Case 1: The proportionality between the current density and the magnetic field is constant everywhere . :::: abla\\\\times(\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{B})= \\\\alpha( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B})=\\\\alpha^2 \\\\mathbf{B} ::::and also :::: abla\\\\times( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B})= abla( abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{B}) - abla^2\\\\mathbf{B}=- abla^2\\\\mathbf{B} , ::::and so ::::- abla^2\\\\mathbf{B} =\\\\alpha^2 \\\\mathbf{B} :::::This is a Helmholtz equation. :::Case 2: The proportionality between the current density and the magnetic field is a function of position. :::: abla\\\\times(\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{B})= \\\\alpha( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B})+ abla\\\\alpha\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B}=\\\\alpha^2 \\\\mathbf{B} + abla\\\\alpha\\\\times\\\\mathbf{B} :::: and so the result is coupled equations: :::: abla^2\\\\mathbf{B}+\\\\alpha^2\\\\mathbf{B}= \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\times abla\\\\alpha and ::::\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\cdot abla\\\\alpha= 0 :::::In this case, the equations do not possess a general solution, and usually must be solved numerically.

Thistle is the common name of a group of flowering plants characterised by leaves with sharp prickles on the margins, mostly in the family Asteraceae. Prickles can also occur all over the plant – on the stem and on the flat parts of the leaves. These prickles are an adaptation that protects the plant from being eaten by herbivores. Typically, an involucre with a clasping shape similar to a cup or urn subtends each of a thistle's flowerheads. The comparative amount of spininess varies dramatically by species. For example, Cirsium heterophyllum has minimal spininess while Cirsium spinosissimum is the opposite. Typically, species adapted to dry environments have greater spininess. The term thistle is sometimes taken to mean precisely those plants in the tribe Cardueae (synonym: Cynareae), especially the genera Carduus, Cirsium, and Onopordum. However, plants outside this tribe are sometimes called thistles, and when this is done, \\"thistles\\" would form a polyphyletic group. A thistle is the floral emblem of Scotland and Lorraine, as well as the emblem of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Biennial thistles are particularly noteworthy for their high wildlife value, producing such things as copious floral resources for pollinators, nourishing seeds for birds like the goldfinch, foliage for butterfly larvae, and down for the lining of birds' nests. Taxonomy Carduus nutans in the early morning light. Thistledown, a method of seed dispersal by wind. The tiny seeds are a favourite of goldfinches and some other small birds. Genera in the Asteraceae with the word thistle often used in their common names include: *Carduus – musk thistle and others *Carlina – carline thistle *Carthamus – distaff thistle *Centaurea – star thistle *Cicerbita – sow thistle *Cirsium – common thistle, field thistle and others *Cnicus – blessed thistle *Cynara – artichoke, cardoon *Echinops – globe thistle *Notobasis – Syrian thistle *Onopordum – cotton thistle, also known as Scots or Scotch thistle *Scolymus – golden thistle or oyster thistle *Silybum – milk thistle *Sonchus – sow thistle Plants in families other than Asteraceae which are sometimes called thistle include: *Kali – Russian thistle, Tartar thistle, or tumbleweed, plants formerly classified in the genus Salsola (family Chenopodiaceae) *Argemone mexicana – flowering thistle, purple prickly poppy Economic significance Thistles, even if one restricts the term to members of the Asteraceae, are too varied a group for generalisation; many are troublesome weeds, including some invasive species of Cirsium, Carduus, Silybum and Onopordum. Typical adverse effects are competition with crops and interference with grazing in pastures, where dense growths of spiny vegetation suppress forage plants and repel grazing animals from eating either the thistle plants or neighbouring forage. Some species, although not intensely poisonous, do affect the health of animals that swallow more than small amounts of the material.Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub. E & S Livingstone 1962 Conversely however, the genus Cynara includes commercially important species of artichoke and some species regarded as major weeds are commercial sources of vegetable rennet used in commercial cheese making. Similarly, some species of Silybum that occur as weeds, also are cultivated for seeds that yield vegetable oil and pharmaceutical compounds such as Silibinin. Other thistles that nominally are weeds are important honey plants, both as bee fodder in general, and as sources of luxury monofloral honey products. Ecology Six-spot burnet moths on a thistle flowerhead Thistle flowers are the favourite nectar sources of the pearl-bordered fritillary, small pearl-bordered fritillary, high brown fritillary, and dark green fritillary butterflies.Bracken for Butterflies leaflet c0853 by Butterfly Conservation, January 2005 Thistles (and thistle-seed feeders) also provide important sustenance for goldfinches and are strongly favored by many butterflies besides fritillaries such as the monarch, skippers, and the tiger swallowtail. Additionally, hummingbirds will feed on the flowers of the biennial species (which feature large flowers, as compared with the perennial Canada thistle). Some thistles (for example Cirsium vulgare, native to Eurasia), have been widely introduced outside their native range.Cirsium vulgare (Savi) Ten., Asteraceae , Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER) Control measures include Trichosirocalus weevils, but a problem with this approach, at least in North America, is that the introduced weevils may affect native thistles at least as much as the desired targets. Thistles have been said to be very important nectar sources for pollinators. Some ecological organizations, such as the Xerces Society, have attempted to raise awareness of their benefits, to counteract the general agricultural and home garden labeling of thistles as unwanted weeds. The monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus for instance, was highlighted as traditionally relying upon taller large-flowered thistle species such as Tall thistle, Cirsium altissimum, for its migration. Although such organizations focus on the benefits of native thistles, certain non-native thistles, such as Cirsium vulgare in North America, may provide similar benefits to wildlife. Some prairie and wildflower seed production companies supply bulk seed for native North American thistle species, for wildlife habitat restoration, although availability tends to be low. Thistles are particularly valued by bumblebees for their high nectar production. Cirsium vulgare ranked in the top 10 for nectar production in a UK plants survey conducted by the AgriLand project which is supported by the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative. Bull thistle was also a top producer of nectar sugar in another study in Britain, ranked third with a production per floral unit of (2323 ± 418μg). Medical uses Maud Grieve recorded that Pliny and medieval writers had thought it could return hair to bald heads and that in the early modern period it had been believed to be a remedy for headaches, plague, canker sores, vertigo, and jaundice. Heraldry =Scottish thistle= According to legend, an invading Norse army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the 1263 Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years. The thistle has been the national emblem of Scotland since the reign of King Alexander III (1249–1286). It is found in many Scottish symbols and was used on silver coins issued by King James III in 1474, the first coins to feature a thistle. In 1536, the bawbee, a sixpence in the pound Scots, was issued for the first time under King James V; it showed a crowned thistle. Thistles continued to appear regularly on Scottish and later British coinage until 2008, when a 5p coin design showing \\"The Badge of Scotland, a thistle royally crowned\\" ceased to be minted, though it remains in circulation. The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, the highest and oldest chivalric order of Scotland, has thistles on its insignia and a chapel in St Giles's Kirk, Edinburgh, dubbed the Thistle Chapel. The thistle is the main charge of the regimental badge of the Scots Guards, the oldest regiment in the British Army. Both the Order of the Thistle and the Scots Guards use the motto Nemo me impune lacessit, the motto of the House of Stuart and referring to the thistle's prickly nature. Pound coins with this motto and a thistle were minted in 1984, 1989, and 2014. The combination of thistle and motto first appeared on the bawbee issued by King Charles II. In 1826 the grant of arms to the new National Bank of Scotland stipulates that the shield be surrounded by thistles and \\"thistle\\" is used as the name of several Scottish football clubs. Since 2013 a stylised thistle, crowned with the Scottish crown, has been the emblem of Police Scotland, and had long featured in the arms of seven of the eight pre-2013 Scottish police services and constabularies, the sole exception being the Northern Constabulary. As part of the arms of the University of Edinburgh, the thistle appears together with a saltire on one of the escutcheons of the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh. The coat of arms and crest of Nova Scotia - \\"New Scotland\\" - briefly Scotland's colony, has since the 17th century featured thistles. Following his ascent to the English throne, King James VI of Scotland & I of England used a badge consisting of a Tudor rose \\"dimidiated\\" with a Scottish thistle and surmounted by a royal crown. As the floral emblem of Scotland it appears in the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom thereafter, and was included in the heraldry of various British institutions, such as the Badge of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom alongside the Tudor rose, Northern Irish flax, and Welsh leek. This floral combination appears on the present issues of the one pound coin. Beside the Tudor rose and Irish shamrock the thistle appears on the badge of the Yeomen of the Guard and the arms of the Canada Company. Issues of the historical florin showed the same flora, later including a leek. The thistle is also used to symbolise connection with Scotland overseas. For example, in Canada, it is one of the four floral emblems on the flag of Montreal; in the US, Carnegie Mellon University features the thistle in its crest in honour of the Scottish heritage of its founder, Andrew Carnegie, and Annapolis, Maryland features the thistle in its flag and seal. The thistle is also the emblem of the Encyclopædia Britannica, which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland. Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours cotton thistle (Onopordum acanthium), perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in medieval times; the spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare), an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. Other species, including dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), musk thistle (Carduus nutans), and melancholy thistle (Cirsium heterophyllum) have also been suggested. =Thistle of Lorraine= Nancy, former capital of the Duchy of Lorraine. The thistle, and more precisely Onopordum acanthium, is one of the symbols of Lorraine, together with its coat of arms which displays three avalerions, and the Cross of Lorraine. Lorraine is a region located in northeastern France, along the border with Luxembourg and Germany. Before the French Revolution, a large part of the region formed the Duchy of Lorraine. In the Middle Ages, the thistle was an emblem of the Virgin Mary because its white sap would bring to mind the milk falling from the breast of the Mother of God. It was later adopted as a personal symbol by René of Anjou, together with the Cross of Lorraine, then known as the Cross of Anjou. It seems through his book Livre du cuer d'amours espris that the Duke chose the thistle as his emblem not only because it was a Christian symbol, but also because he associated it with physical love. The thistle and the cross were used again by his grandson, René II, Duke of Lorraine, who introduced them in the region. The two symbols became hugely popular among the local people during the Battle of Nancy in 1477, during which the Lorrain army defeated Burgundy. The Duke's motto was \\"Qui s'y frotte s'y pique\\", meaning \\"who touches it, pricks oneself\\", with a similar idea to the Scottish motto \\"Nemo me impune lacessit\\". Nowadays the thistle is still the official symbol of the city of Nancy, as well as the emblem of the AS Nancy football team, and the Lorraine Regional Natural Park. Place names Carduus is the Latin term for a thistle (hence cardoon, chardon in French), and Cardonnacum is the Latin word for a place with thistles. This is believed to be the origin of name of the Burgundy village of Chardonnay, Saône-et- Loire, which in turn is thought to be the home of the famous Chardonnay grape variety.

Some scholars and Muslim religious figures describe armed struggle based on Islamic principles as the Lesser jihad. Development of rulings The first military rulings were formulated during the first century after Muhammad established an Islamic state in Medina. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Qur'an (the Islamic Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions, actions (behaviors), sayings and consents of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the justness of war (Harb), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover feuds and armed conflicts in general.Aboul-Enein and Zuhur (2004), pp. 3–4 Jihad (Arabic for \\"struggle\\") was given a military dimension after the oppressive practices of the Meccan Quraish against Muslims. It was interpreted as the struggle in God's cause to be conducted by the Muslim community. Injunctions relating to jihad have been characterized as individual as well as collective duties of the Muslim community. Hence, the nature of attack is important in the interpretation—if the Muslim community as a whole is attacked jihad becomes incumbent on all Muslims. Jihad is differentiated further in respect to the requirements within Muslim-governed lands (Dar al-Islam) and non-Muslim lands (Dar al-Harb). According to Shaheen Sardar Ali and Javaid Rehman, both professors of law, the Islamic military jurisprudence are in line with rules of modern international law. They point to the dual commitment of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states (representing most of the Muslim world) to Islamic law and the United Nations Charter, as evidence of compatibility of both legal systems.Ali, Shaheen Sardar; Rehman, Javaid.

The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion and first Caliph, Abu Bakr, in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army:Aboul-Enein, H. Yousuf and Zuhur, Sherifa, Islamic Rulings on Warfare, p. 22, Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, Diane Publishing Co., Darby PA, According to Tabari, the ten bits of \\"advice\\" that Abu Bakr gave was during the Expedition of Usama bin Zayd. During the Battle of Siffin, the Caliph Ali stated that Islam does not permit Muslims to stop the supply of water to their enemy.Encyclopaedia of Islam (2005), p. 204 In addition to the Rashidun Caliphs, hadiths attributed to Muhammad himself suggest that he stated the following regarding the Muslim conquest of Egypt that eventually took place after his death: These principles were upheld by 'Amr ibn al-'As during his conquest of Egypt. A Christian contemporary in the 7th century, John of Nikiû, stated the following regarding the conquest of Alexandria by 'Amr: The principles established by the early Caliphs were also honoured during the Crusades, as exemplified by Sultans such as Saladin and Al-Kamil. For example, after Al-Kamil defeated the Franks during the Crusades, Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic laws of war, commenting on how Al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food: The early Islamic treatises on international law from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic ethics, Islamic economic jurisprudence and Islamic military jurisprudence to international law, and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the law of treaties; the treatment of diplomats, hostages, refugees and prisoners of war; the right of asylum; conduct on the battlefield; protection of women, children and non- combatant civilians; contracts across the lines of battle; the use of poisonous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory. Criteria for soldiering Muslim jurists agree that Muslim armed forces must consist of debt-free adults who possess a sound mind and body. In addition, the combatants must not be conscripted, but rather enlist of their free will, and with the permission of their family.Aboul-Enein and Zuhur, pp. 12-13 Legitimacy of war Muslims have struggled to differentiate between legitimate and illegitimate wars. Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.Afsaruddin, Asma (2007). Views of Jihad Throughout History. Religion Compass 1 (1), pp. 165–69. =Defensive conflict= According to the majority of jurists, the Qur'anic casus belli (justification of war) are restricted to aggression against Muslims and fitna—persecution of Muslims because of their religious belief.Ahmed Al- Dawoody (2011), The Islamic Law of War: Justifications and Regulations, pp. 78–9. Palgrave Macmillan. . They hold that unbelief in itself is not the justification for war. These jurists therefore maintain that only combatants are to be fought; noncombatants such as women, children, clergy, the aged, the insane, farmers, serfs, the blind, and so on are not to be killed in war. Thus, the Hanafī Ibn Najīm states: \\"the reason for jihād in our [the Hanafīs] view is kawnuhum harbā ‛alaynā [literally, their being at war against us].\\"Ibn Najīm, Al-Bahr al-Rā’iq, Vol. 5, p. 76. The Hanafī jurists al-Shaybānī and al- Sarakhsī state that \\"although kufr [unbelief in God] is one of the greatest sins, it is between the individual and his God the Almighty and the punishment for this sin is to be postponed to the dār al-jazā’, (the abode of reckoning, the Hereafter).\\"Khaled Abou El Fadl, The Rules of Killing at War: An Inquiry into Classical Sources, p. 152. The Muslim World. Volume 89, Issue 2, April 1999. doi: 10.1111/j.1478-1913.1999.tb03675.x War, according to the Hanafis, can't simply be made on the account of a nation's religion. Abdulaziz Sachedina argues that the original jihad according to his version of Shi'ism was permission to fight back against those who broke their pledges. Thus the Qur'an justified defensive jihad by allowing Muslims to fight back against hostile and dangerous forces. =Offensive conflict= Muhammad ibn Idris ash- Shafi\`i (d. 820), founder of the Shafi'i school of thought, was the first to permit offensive jihad, limiting this warfare against pagan Arabs only, not permitting it against non-Arab non-Muslims. This view of al-Shafi'i is mitigated by the fact that an opposite view, in agreement with the majority, is also attributed to al-Shafi'i. According to Abdulaziz Sachedina, offensive jihad raises questions about whether jihad is justifiable on moral grounds. He states that the Qur'an requires Muslims to establish just public order, increasing the influence of Islam, allowing public Islamic worship, through offensive measures. To this end, the Qur'anic verses revealed required Muslims to wage jihad against unbelievers who persecuted them. This has been complicated by the early Muslim conquests, which he argues were although considered jihad by Sunni scholars, but under close scrutiny can be determined to be political. Moreover, the offensive jihad points more to the complex relationship with the \\"People of the book\\". Some major modern scholars who have rejected the idea of \\"offensive jihad\\" include the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hasan al-Banna (1906–1949), the Al-Azhar scholar Muhammad Abu Zahra (1898–1974) who thought that \\"military jihad is permitted only to remove aggression ('udwân) and religious persecution (fitnah) against Muslims\\", as well as Syrian scholars Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti (1929–2013) and Wahbah al-Zuhayli (1932-2015), the latter saying that \\"peace is the underlying principle of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims. al-Zuhayli maintains that this view is supported by 8:61, as well as 2:208 and 4:94 that establish the principle of international peace. For him, Muslims should be committed to peace and security (on the basis of 4:90 and 60:8).\\"ElSayed Amin, Reclaiming Jihad: A Qur'anic Critique of Terrorism, Kube Publishing (2015), pp. 104-106 International conflict International conflicts are armed strifes conducted by one state against another, and are distinguished from civil wars or armed strife within a state.Dāmād (2003), p.261 Some classical Islamic scholars, like the Shafi'i, classified territories into broad categories: dar al-islam (\\"abode of Islam\\"), dar al-harb (\\"abode of war), dar al-ahd (\\"abode of treaty\\"), and dar al-sulh (\\"abode of reconciliation\\"). Such categorizations of states, according to Asma Afsaruddin, are not mentioned in the Qur'an and Islamic tradition. =Declaration of war= The Qur'an commands Muslims to make a proper declaration of war prior to the commencement of military operations. Thus, surprise attacks prior to such a declaration are illegal under the Islamic jurisprudence. The Qur'an had similarly commanded Muhammad to give his enemies, who had violated the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, a time period of four months to reconsider their position and negotiate.Maududi (1967), p. 177, vol. 2 This rule, however, is not binding if the adversary has already started the war.Maududi (1998), p. 36 Forcible prevention of religious practice is considered an act of war. =Conduct of armed forces= During battle the Qur'an commands Muslims to fight against the enemy. However, there are restrictions to such combat. Burning or drowning the enemy is allowed only if it is impossible to achieve victory by other means. The mutilation of dead bodies is prohibited.Ghamid (2001), referring to Sahih Bukhari 3016, and Sahih Bukhari 2613 The Qur'an also discourages Muslim combatants from displaying pomp and unnecessary boasting when setting out for battle.Ghamidi (2001), referring to According to professor Sayyid Dāmād, no explicit injunctions against use of chemical or biological warfare were developed by medieval Islamic jurists as these threats were not existent then. However, Khalil al- Maliki's Book on jihad states that combatants are forbidden to employ weapons that cause unnecessary injury to the enemy, except under dire circumstances. The book, as an example, forbids the use of poisonous spears, since it inflicts unnecessary pain.Dāmād (2003), p. 266 Civilian areas According to all madhhabs, it is not permissible to kill women or children unless they are fighting against the Muslims. The Hanafi, Hanbali, and Maliki schools forbid killing of those who are not able to fight, including monks, farmers, and serfs, as well as mentally and physically disabled. Harming civilian areas and pillaging residential areas is also forbidden,Maududi (1998), p. 35 as is the destruction of trees, crops, livestock and farmlands.Ali ibn al-Athir, Al-Kamil fi al-Tarikh, Vol. 3, p. 227Ali (1991), p. 79, quoting The Muslim forces may not loot travelers, as doing so is contrary to the spirit of jihad.Ghamidi (2006), refers to Sahih Bukhari 2629 Nor do they have the right to use the local facilities of the native people without their consent. If such a consent is obtained, the Muslim army is still under the obligation to compensate the people financially for the use of such facilities. However, Islamic law allows the confiscation of military equipment and supplies captured from the camps and military headquarters of the combatant armies.Ghamidi (2001), refers to a hadith \\"plundered [food] is not better than dead meat [forbidden in Islam]\\" Sahih Bukhari 2705 =Negotiations= Commentators of the Qur'an agree that Muslims should always be willing and ready to negotiate peace with the other party without any hesitation. According to Maududi, Islam does not permit Muslims to reject peace and continue bloodshed.Maududi (1967), p. 151–14, vol. 2 Islamic jurisprudence calls for third party interventions as another means of ending conflicts. Such interventions are to establish mediation between the two parties to achieve a just resolution of the dispute.Abu-Nimer(2000-2001), p. 246. =Ceasefire= In the context of seventh century Arabia, the Qur'an ordained Muslims must restrain themselves from fighting in the months when fighting was prohibited by Arab pagans. The Qur'an also required the respect of this cease-fire, prohibiting its violation. If, however, non-Muslims commit acts of aggression, Muslims are free to retaliate, though in a manner that is equal to the original transgression.Ali (1991), p. 81 The \\"sword verse\\", which has attracted attention, is directed against a particular group who violate the terms of peace and commit aggression (but excepts those who observe the treaty). Crone states that this verse seems to be based on the same above- mentioned rules. Here also it is stressed that one must stop when they do. Ibn Kathir states that the verse implies a hasty mission of besieging and gathering intelligence about the enemy, resulting in either death or repentance by the enemy.This is the Ayah of the Sword by Ibn Kathir It is read as a continuation of previous verses, it would be concerned with the same oath-breaking of \\"polytheists\\". =Prisoners of war= Men, women, and children may all be taken as prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, a prisoner of war could be, at the discretion of the military leader, executed, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners,Tafsir of the Qur'an by Ibn Kathir Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam or kept as slaves. In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of war could secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write.Ibrahim Syed, Education of Muslims in Kentucky Prisons. Louisville: Islamic Research Foundation International Some Muslim scholars hold that a prisoner may not be ransomed for gold or silver, but may be exchanged for Muslim prisoners.'Abu Yusuf Ya'qub Le Livre de l'impot foncier,' translated from Arabic and annotated by Edmond Fagnan, Paris, Paul Geuthner, 1991, pages 301–302. Abu Yusuf (d. 798 CE) Women and children prisoners of war cannot be killed under any circumstances, regardless of their religious convictions,Patricia Crone (2004), pp. 371-72 but they may be freed or ransomed. Women who are neither freed nor ransomed by their people were to be kept in bondage - also referred to as malakah, however dispute exists among scholars on the term's interpretation. Islamic law does not put an exact limit on the number that can be kept in bondage. Internal conflict Internal conflicts include \\"civil wars\\", launched against rebels, and \\"wars for welfare\\" launched against bandits. During their first civil war, Muslims fought at the Battle of Bassorah. In this engagement, Ali (the caliph), set the precedent for war against other Muslims, which most later Muslims have accepted. According to Ali's rules, wounded or captured enemies should not be killed, those throwing away their arms should not be fought, and those fleeing from the battleground should not be pursued. Only captured weapons and animals (horses and camels which have been used in the war) are to be considered war booty. No war prisoners, women or children are to be enslaved and the property of the slain enemies are to go to their legal Muslim heirs.Madelung (1997), p.179 Different views regarding armed rebellion have prevailed in the Muslim world at different times. During the first three centuries of Muslim history, jurists held that a political rebel may not be executed nor his/her property confiscated. Classical jurists, however, laid down severe penalties for rebels who use \\"stealth attacks\\" and \\"spread terror\\". In this category, Muslim jurists included abductions, poisoning of water wells, arson, attacks against wayfarers and travellers, assaults under the cover of night and rape. The punishment for such crimes were severe, including death, regardless of the political convictions and religion of the perpetrator. Some modern commentators have argued that the classical precedent of harsh punishments for rebels engaging in attacks that harmed civilian populations can be taken as evidence that the religious justifications used by Islamist groups such as al Qaeda and ISIL are not, in fact, grounded in the Islamic tradition.Abou El Fadl, Khaled.

It is known from Islamic and Chinese sources, but its location is uncertain, with some authors favouring North Ossetia and others pointing to Arkhyz in modern-day Karachay–Cherkessia, where three 10th- century churches still stand. However, the historian John Latham Sprinkle from the University of Ghent (Belgium) claims to have discovered that Il’ichevsk is the exact location of Maghas, by consulting several written sources. \\"The most important were the report of an Arab geographer from the 940s on Magas and two writings from Persia and one from China from the 13th and 14th centuries on the capture of the city by the Mongols\\". Latham Sprinkle compared these written sources to the archaeological findings collected by a local teacher in Soviet times on Il'ichevsk, where he also uncovered evidence of a burnt down church as well as the grave of a child. Il’ichevsk has never really been thoroughly researched, this may be because it is positioned in Krasnodar Krai. This is a border province that belongs to Russia itself and with leaders who turn their gaze to Moscow. \\"Five autonomous regions within Russia claim that they, and they alone, are the heirs of the Alans\\", \\"They are all sub-publics with a predominantly non-Russian population and a strong nationalist reflex such as Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia\\". \\"Over the past 200 years, these peoples have designated several sites on their own territory as the original site of Magas to draw on the legacy of Alanië. In 1994, Ingushetia even built a brand-new capital which it also called Magas, although it has nothing to do with the historic Maghas\\". No site designated by the autonomous regions could ever really convince archaeologists and specialists. \\"Magas was in the woods and was firmly defended. This did not prevent the Mongols from taking the city and destroying it in the winter of 1239-1240. So to identify Magas with certainty, we need evidence of royal control, ramparts, forests, and destruction in the 13th century. The sites that have emerged so far lack one of these four factors\\". The irony is that Il'ichevsk is not located in any of the five autonomous regions claiming the inheritance of Alania. Latham Sprinkle's research will be published in the month of June 2020 in the scientific journal Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies. Some archaeologists and specialists on site are already predominantly positive. How politicians and nationalists will react, can' be estimated. But, it may well be that many people in those areas will be particularly interested. This is their historic capital that has finally been discovered. The destruction of Maghas is ascribed to Batu Khan, a Mongol leader and a grandson of Genghis Khan, in the beginning of 1239. Some Russian geographers, like D. V. Zayats, point to a location in Ingushetia. The capital of the Russian Republic of Ingushetia, Magas, is named after Maghas.

Completed in 1920, it runs from Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon to the very north of the New Territories, serving south, west and north New Territories, being one of the most distant roads in early Hong Kong. Name Castle Peak Road in Tsuen Wan. The road was named after Castle Peak, a peak in the western New Territories. The area to the east of the peak was hence named Castle Peak. Later at the dawn of the development of new town, the area was renamed to its old name, Tuen Mun. The road was originally known in Chinese as Tsing Shan To () for its entire length. The Chinese name of the section of the road in the New Territories was later changed to Tsing Shan Kung Lo () Lit. \\"Castle Peak public road\\" or \\"Castle Peak Highway\\". In everyday conversation, however, the term Tsing Shan To survives for the stretches within Tsuen Wan and Yuen Long. History The road was constructed soon after the British leased the New Territories in 1898. Speaking in the Legislative Council in 1909, Governor Frederick Lugard cited the facilitation of trade and police control as reasons for the road's construction. It was built and gradually widened in sections. Route =Kowloon= The road starts east at Tai Po Road in Sham Shui Po and passes through Cheung Sha Wan and Lai Chi Kok in Kowloon. On both sides of the road are old residential blocks, with some dated back to pre-World War II. Towards Lai Chi Kok, it is surrounded by industrial buildings instead. The road is one-way eastbound between Kom Tsun Street & its terminus at Tai Po Road. =New Territories= Castle Peak Road near San Hui, Tuen Mun. After leaving Kowloon, it goes uphill past Kau Wa Keng and Tai Ching Cheung along a four-lane expressway to Kwai Chung and downhill into Tsuen Wan. The stretch within Tsuen Wan is also commonly called \\"main road\\" (), especially among the older generations. Next, it goes along the south shore of the Western New Territories, via Yau Kom Tau, Ting Kau, Sham Tseng, Tsing Lung Tau, Tai Lam, Siu Lam and So Kwun Wat and then reaches the Tuen Mun New Town, which was also known as Castle Peak (after which the road was named). Much of this stretch was bypassed by Tuen Mun Road between 1977 and 1983. It continues north-east as a six-laned road, paralleling the Light Rail through Lam Tei, Hung Shui Kiu, Ping Shan and goes through another new town, Yuen Long New Town. The section within Yuen Long, again, is also commonly called \\"main road\\" (). This section was bypassed by the Yuen Long Highway in 1992. It then turns north at Au Tau, just west of Kam Tin. This section is paralleled by San Tin Highway, constructed between 1991 and 1993. It then passes through Mai Po, San Tin, Lok Ma Chau (near the Chinese border), Pak Shek Au and Kwu Tung before terminating at Fan Kam Road in Sheung Shui.

All five were shot dead in the ensuing gunfight with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), while one civilian died in the grenade attack that the attackers launched in order to breach the cordoned wall. The CRPF suffered three casualties, two of whom were seriously injured with multiple gunshot wounds.  Attack  Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, a makeshift temple had been constructed at the Ram Janmabhoomi site, in the city of Ayodhya. According to Hindusium the site was the birthplace of Hindu deity King Rama. On 5 July 2005, the heavily guarded Ram Janmabhoomi - Babri Masjid complex was attacked by heavily armed terrorists. The attack was foiled by security officials and the attackers were killed. The terrorists were from the Islamic terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, and were believed to have entered India through Nepal. They posed as pilgrims on their way to Ayodhya, and boarded a Tata Sumo at Akbarpur near the Kichaucha village in Faizabad. At Faizabad they abandoned the Sumo and hired a jeep driven by a driver, Rehan Alam Amsari. According to a statement by the driver, the terrorists visited the Ram (Temple) at Ayodhya where they prayed, possibly to reinforce the impression that they were indeed pilgrims. The terrorists then drove the jeep into the Ram Janmabhoomi site, and forced the driver out of the vehicle, banging the jeep against the security cordon. At 9:05 am, they hurled M67 grenades from 50 metres away to breach the cordon fence. Ramesh Pandey, a pilgrim guide who happened to be near the site at this moment, died on the spot as a result of the grenade blast. Firing indiscriminately, the 5 terrorists entered the Mata Sita Rasoi. Returning the gunfire, a platoon of 35 CRPF soldiers killed all five of the terrorists in a gunfight that lasted for over an hour. Three CRPF soldiers also received serious injuries and, as of July 2008, two remain comatose. All the terrorists died within 100 metres of the site.  Investigation  The assailants were suspected to belong to the Islamic terrorist group Lashkar-e- Taiba. The investigating team tracked the phone calls made from the cell phones carried by the terrorists using the IMEI numbers. The Police recovered a single RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launcher, five Type 56 assault rifles, five M1911 pistols, several M67 grenades and some jihadi documents. Rehan Alam, the jeep driver, was detained by the police for further investigations. On 28 July 2005, four Muslim men from Jammu and Kashmir – Akbar Hussain, Lal Mohammad, Mohmmad Naseer and Mohmmad Rafeeq – were arrested in connection with the attack. On 3 August 2005, another four Muslim men– Asif Iqbal, Mohammed Aziz, Mohammed Nasim and Shaqeel Ahmed– were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the bombing. A fifth man, Irfan Khan, was arrested a few days earlier.  Aftermath  Most of India's political organisations condemned the attack as barbaric and requested people to maintain law and order. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, its affiliates the Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared an India-wide protest and bandh on 8 July 2005. BJP president L.K. Advani called for the reinstatement of the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act in the wake of the attack.

It is the sequel to the 1997 video game Formula 1 97 and was based on the 1998 Formula One World Championship. Overview Following the departure of Bizarre Creations, Psygnosis offered Reflections Interactive the chance to develop Formula 1 98. However, they pulled out to make Driver. Visual Science were hired to make the game. The game was then rushed for release to coincide with the final race of the 1998 Formula One World Championship. As a result of this, the game ended up being very poorly-received by various gaming publications. Despite this, the game was a best-seller in the UK. Circuits The game features 16 official Formula One circuits based on the 1998 Formula One World Championship plus 2 hidden tracks which can be accessed with cheat codes. One is based upon a Hippodrome, although it says \\"Coloseum\\" in the selection screen and the other one is a Stunttrack. Teams and drivers The game features all of the official teams and drivers that competed in the 1998 Formula One World Championship, although like with its predecessor, Formula 1 97, Jacques Villeneuve's name and image are not featured due to him copyrighting both. The game refers to him as 'Williams Driver 1'. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. PlayStation Power gave it a review of 69%, noting that \\"Psygnosis have managed to cock up the one uncockupable licence on the PlayStation\\" and that it was far worse than both F1 '97 and the original F1 game on the PlayStation. In February 1999, Formula 1 98 received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 200,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

The building, designed by Cross & Cross and completed in 1931, was known as the RCA Victor Building during its construction. 570 Lexington Avenue is sometimes known by its address to avoid confusion with 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which was also once known as the GE Building. 570 Lexington Avenue contains a 50-floor, stylized Gothic octagonal brick tower, with elaborate Art Deco decorations of lightning bolts showing the power of electricity. The tower is set back from the round-cornered base with elaborate masonry and architectural figural sculpture. The building was designed to blend with the low Byzantine dome of the adjacent St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on Park Avenue, with the same brick coloring and architectural terracotta decoration. The crown of the building, an example of Gothic tracery, is intended to represent electricity and radio waves. On the corner above the building's main entrance is a clock with the cursive GE logo and a pair of disembodied silver arms holding bolts of electricity. Plans for the building were announced in 1929, and it was completed two years later. The project was originally commissioned for RCA, then a subsidiary of General Electric (GE). RCA moved to 30 Rockefeller Plaza midway through construction, and 570 Lexington Avenue was conveyed to GE as part of an agreement in which RCA and GE split their properties. GE had its headquarters at 570 Lexington Avenue between 1933 and 1974. Afterward, GE retained the building until it donated it to Columbia University in 1993 for a tax deduction. The building was extensively renovated by Ernest de Castro of the WCA Design Group. It was designated a New York City landmark in 1985, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.  Site  The General Electric Building occupies the southwestern corner of Lexington Avenue and 51st Street in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It sits on the northeastern portion of a city block bounded by Park Avenue to the west, 50th Street to the south, Lexington Avenue to the east, and 51st Street to the north. St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church is directly to the west on the same city block, and another office building is to the south. The General Electric Building is also near the Waldorf Astoria New York to the south and the Summit Hotel and Beverly Hotel to the east. Entrances to the New York City Subway's Lexington Avenue/51st Street station, served by the , are adjacent to the north side of the building. Design The General Electric Building was designed by John Walter Cross of Cross & Cross in the Art Deco style with Gothic Revival ornamentation. It was developed by the Bartholomew Building Corporation, originally for RCA, though the building was renamed for General Electric (GE) midway through construction when RCA decided to move to 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The steel was erected by the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company, while the concrete floor arches were contracted to Brennan & Sloan. The building was designed to harmonize with neighboring structures, particularly St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, as well as the since-demolished building of Cathedral High School to the south. There are 46 office floors in total, as well as four mechanical floors, although the 48th and 49th floors also once contained executive dining rooms. Sources disagree slightly on the building's precise height. Emporis gives a height of , while the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat's Skyscraper Center cites the building as being . = Form = The building's lowest stories contain elaborate masonry and architectural figural sculpture, with a round corner facing Lexington Avenue and 51st Street. Above a series of gradual setbacks, the building rises into a octagonal brick tower similar to Cross & Cross's earlier design for 20 Exchange Place. Its stylized Gothic tower, with elaborate Art Deco decorations of lightning bolts showing the power of electricity. The base and tower form \\"one of the most expressive skyscrapers of its era.\\" The lowest twelve stories fill the entire lot area. Between the 13th and 25th stories, the building contains shallow setbacks on each side or elevation. The Lexington Avenue and 51st Street elevations contain setbacks on the 13th, 16th, 19th, and 22nd floors, and the Lexington Avenue elevation also has a setback at the 25th floor. The centers of the Lexington Avenue and 51st Street elevations contain projecting pyramidal dormers that rise one to three additional stories above the previous setback. The building's tower rises above these setbacks. The corners of the tower are chamfered to form an eight-sided floor plan, except on the building's northeast corner below the 35th floor, which is not chamfered. = Facade = The facade was designed to blend with the low Byzantine dome of St. Bartholomew's Church and shares the same brick color, with terracotta decorations chosen to coordinate. Brick in orange, tawny, and buff colors was used throughout the facade. The bricks and brick bond are juxtaposed to create the impression of a bronze hue as well. The window sills, corbels, spandrels, and other elements on the facade were made of terracotta in similar shades. The lowest section of the ground-story facade is made of reddish granite, and some of the upper-story trimmings are made of reddish marble. The terracotta on the upper stories were sprayed with fourteen-carat gold. The detail of the facade wraps around to its rear elevations as well. The design is emphasized by rounded vertical piers, which separate the facade into bays, and recessed spandrels, which separate the windows between each floor. The piers rise above and between the openings of the first floor. The spandrels are mostly similar in design. On the building's primary elevations, the upper section of a typical spandrel contains a large chevron made of fluted bars, while the lower section contains two half-size chevrons with smaller fluting. Running vertically along the center of each spandrel contains a lozenge-shaped bolt with aluminized finishing.  Base  Pediment above the loading dock At ground level, the facade contains display windows with storefronts; the large display windows are two bays wide, while the small display windows are one bay wide. The Lexington Avenue elevation has four large display windows, two on either side of the main entrance. The 51st Street elevation has four large and two small display windows, a two-bay-wide loading dock, and a one-bay-wide freight entrance. The display windows and loading dock are surrounded with a red marble frame containing reeded jambs. Above each display window is a triangular pediment with a fluted tympanum; a stepped pediment frame; and a niche in the pier above the center of the pediment, containing a representation of an \\"electric spirit\\". The pediments above the main entrance and freight entrance are more elaborate. The main entrance is on Lexington Avenue and contains three single-leaf metal doors. The Lexington Avenue entrance is topped by a transom window with interlocked triangles. The pediment above the freight entrance contains an aluminum panel under a series of round brick semicircles; the doorway below is a simple metal door. The building's northeast corner, facing Lexington Avenue and 51st Street contains a more ornate design than the rest of the facade, and was intended to lead to a bank space on the first floor. At ground level, there is a non- structural buttress made of marble, with elaborate pediments above. The buttress consists of two bays, one facing each street, and is supported by a pier at the corner. On the pier is a clock with the cursive GE logo and a pair of disembodied silver arms holding bolts of electricity. The bays of the corner buttress are topped by tripartite triangular marble pediments, which feature a clenched fist holding an electric bolt, topped by a series of round brick semicircles.  Upper stories  alt=Between the 2nd and 12th floors, the building's northeast corner is curved, and contains two bays. The spandrels of the corner bays contain a pattern of three lozenges increasing in size from bottom to top, with the topmost lozenge containing an aluminized finish. Above the 12th floor, the northeast corner contains a flat chamfer on each of the setback portions between the 12th and 21st floors. There are also three sculptures of \\"electric spirits\\" on the northeast corner: at the 12th floor, between the 23rd and 25th floors, and between the 34th and 35th floors. Because of the building's massing, these \\"electric spirits\\" are offset from the ground-level entrance. Stylized visages also overlook the central bays along both Lexington Avenue and 51st Street. The tower contains four bays on each of the major elevations facing north, south, west, and east, as well as one bay in each chamfer. The spandrels between the 45th and 48th floors consist of raised circles with entirely aluminized finishing. An arch rises over the 49th floor of each major elevation. The central pier on each side rises above the arch to support one of four figures in the building's crown. Each of the figures depicts a deity holding forked lightning. The building's crown contains Gothic tracery, which is intended to represent electricity and radio waves. The \\"rays\\" of the deities have the ability to light up at night. =Features= The building has of floor space according to The New York Times, although the Skyscraper Center gives the gross floor area as being . The lowest floors typically contain each, while the tower floors contain . The interior structure contains a myriad of columns supporting each floor. The lobby retains many elements of its original design, and some secondary spaces and offices still have some of their initial design elements. However, many floors have been remodeled. The original ornate features of the basement auditorium and the dining rooms at the 48th and 49th floors were removed.  Lobby  Lexington Avenue entrance vestibule There is a vestibule inside the Lexington Avenue entrance, which contains a polished granite floor. Similar to the exterior, the walls of the vestibule consist of a red marble surface over a red-granite base. The side walls have decorative radiator grilles containing tall rectangles with angular tops. Atop the walls of the vestibule is a frieze consisting of a wave mosaic between beige marble bands; it is interrupted by two slightly projecting stones that serve as reflectors. Metal sconces, shaped like torches, are placed on the walls below the frieze. The vestibule's ceiling contains a smooth barrel vault with silver-leaf finishing, as well as an overhanging Art Deco chandelier. The vestibule and the building's lobby are separated by a marble wall. A metal revolving door flanked by two smaller doors leads to the lobby, while a transom window and decorative metal grille are above these doors. The lobby is a long, rectangular space extending west from the Lexington Avenue vestibule. The terrazzo floor contains elaborate geometric designs and marble highlights. The walls are made of convex pink marble panels with darker red veins, placed over a base made of white-veined black marble. The walls are topped by wave friezes and torch-shaped sconces, similar to those in the vestibule, although the lobby's western wall does not have a wave frieze. The lobby ceiling is made of barrel vaults painted in silver. The vaults rise in a lune shape, supported on slightly projecting stones along the length of the friezes atop each wall; the lunes touch at the apex of each vault. The vaults form triangular cut-outs above the frieze on either sidewall, each of which contain one of two mural designs with arrow motifs. Three chandeliers hang from the ceiling. John Cross, one of the building's architects, intended the design of the lobby to give off an impression of \\"vibrant energy\\". The lobby's western wall contains an opening that is closed-off by a metal Art Deco screen; this opening is topped by a decorative clock with a metal frame and a red-marble face. On the northern wall, a wide opening leads to a staircase to the basement as well as an adjacent commercial space. A similar opening on the south wall led to a waiting room and shopping arcade, but was sealed in 1995, when the security desk was installed in front of that opening. The elevator openings, five each on the northern and southern walls, contain painted metal doors with digital floor indicators above them. There are also openings leading from the lobby to various secondary spaces, as well as decorative grilles on the walls. Extending past the western wall of the lobby is a transverse corridor, which contains a similar ceiling design and terrazzo floors. This transverse corridor leads to a freight entrance with marble walls and decorative grilles on the freight doors. On the western side of the ground floor, south of the lobby, is an area with plain terrazzo floors and metal sconces; this space has a stairway to the basement.  Other floors  The ten elevators from the ground-floor lobby descend to the basement lobby, which contains a simpler design compared to the main lobby. The terrazzo floor is checkered, the walls are made of pink marble slabs, and the elevators contain their original floor indicators. Adjacent to the basement lobby is an auditorium with a plain sloped plaster ceiling and white walls, as well as a small stage. The Bartholomew Building Corporation arranged with the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which at the time operated the 51st Street station, to construct an entrance to the station's downtown platform in the General Electric Building's basement. The basement entrance replaced a sidewalk staircase along 51st Street at Lexington Avenue. The passageway was made of marble with aluminum storefronts. Before the 21st century. this passageway was sealed off with a marble-clad partition. The elevators contain wood-paneled walls, as well as white-metal railings and corner lights that date from the original design. The ceilings of the elevator cabs are made of silver leaf. During some point in the 20th century, the silver-leaf ceilings of the elevators were hidden from view, although they were restored at some point before 2003. The upper floors were plainer in design compared to the public areas. As built, each story in the building's base contained elevator lobbies with terrazzo floors, as well as marble walls with wave mosaics. Smaller elevator lobbies existed in the floors of the tower, although many of these lobbies were removed during subsequent renovations, giving offices direct access to the elevators. The 48th and 49th floors, the highest usable stories in the General Electric Building, contained the executive dining rooms and were occupied by the General Electric Luncheon Club. The 48th floor had private rooms and the 49th floor had a large dining room. Raymond Hood and J. André Fouilhoux designed a \\"technologically advanced\\" conference room at some point when GE occupied the building, although the conference room no longer exists. History = Site and planning = The \\"GE\\" clock above the corner entrance The lots making up the General Electric Building's site were purchased by Frederick and Maximilian Schaefer starting in 1867, and were developed as the Schaefer Brewery in 1878. The Park Avenue railroad tracks, running in an open cut less than a block west of the site, were placed underground as part of the construction of Grand Central Terminal in the early 20th century. The opening of Grand Central Terminal in 1913 spurred development in the area bounded by Lexington Avenue, Madison Avenue, 51st Street, and 42nd Street. St. Bartholomew's Church bought the Schaefer site in 1914. The church's main building was erected on the block's northwestern corner in 1919, and St. Patrick's Cathedral developed Cathedral High School on the southeastern corner in 1924. After St. Bartholomew's built its chapter house and garden on the block's southwestern corner, the Schaefer site was the only one on the block that was not developed. In September 1929, Tishman Realty & Construction acquired plots at the southwestern corner of Lexington Avenue and 51st Street, passing it to the Bartholomew Building Corporation through intermediary Stanhope Estates Inc. The large corner lot was purchased from the Norko Realty Company and Julian Tishman & Sons, as well as two smaller lots on 51st Street from the Nichols Holding Company. In October 1929, the Bartholomew Building Corporation bought the land from Tishman. The site comprised on the southwestern corner of Lexington Avenue and 51st Street, with frontage of on Lexington Avenue and on 51st Street; it was to be developed with a 46-story skyscraper at 570 Lexington Avenue. RCA was expected to be one of the major tenants, although the Bartholomew Building Corporation originally refused to confirm this fact. At the time, RCA held a \\"virtual monopoly on the advertising, marketing, distribution, and selling of communication devices and services\\" in the United States, though it was barred from making these products and services on its own. = Construction = Cross & Cross were hired for the project and filed official blueprints. The New York City Department of Buildings issued a new-building permit for the project on December 17, 1929. Detailed plans for 570 Lexington Avenue, by then known as the RCA Victor Building, were publicized in March 1930. As announced, it would be tall, consisting of a base of at least 20 stories that tapered into a 30-story tower. The building would contain of office space, half to be occupied by RCA. RCA's subsidiaries, NBC and RKO General, would occupy the 9th through 17th floors. A construction contract was immediately let to the A. L. Hartridge Company. The demolition of the existing rowhouses on the site were completed on April 15, 1930. The northern wall of Cathedral High School was left vulnerable as a result of the demolition, so it was reinforced with cinder concrete. Simultaneously with the development of the RCA Victor Building, John D. Rockefeller Jr. was planning a large building complex (later Rockefeller Center) three blocks west of the new skyscraper. In December 1929, the Metropolitan Opera had declined an offer to develop a new opera house at Rockefeller's site. Raymond Hood, one of the architects involved in the construction of Rockefeller Center, suggested negotiating with RCA and its subsidiaries to build a mass media entertainment complex there. RCA's founder and GE's chairman, Owen D. Young, was amenable to the proposal. At the time, RCA was seeking more independence from the operations of GE, and three months after David Sarnoff became president of RCA in January 1930, the two companies reached an agreement to separate their operations. As part of that agreement, RCA gave some of its stock and the then-under-construction RCA Victor Building to GE, and the RCA Victor Building became known as the General Electric Building. Work on the General Electric Building commenced on May 3, 1930. The contract with the steel supplier, the McClintic-Marshall Company, specified a tight construction schedule, which the building's construction appeared to have closely followed. While the facade's decorative elements were originally planned to be made of limestone, this was swapped with terracotta, and limestone was only used between the 34th and 35th floors. The aluminum spandrels planned for the upper floors were also replaced with terracotta finished in aluminum. Initial plans called for a more ornate corner entrance with red-and-black marble, aluminum plant motifs, and inlaid enamel. Construction of floor arches and the steel frame continued through mid-1930, during which RCA continued negotiating a move to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, then under construction. The Bartholomew Building Corporation conveyed the building's leasehold to RCA on January 13, 1931, and property title passed to GE ten days afterward. Construction was completed at the end of 1931. = Use =  1930s to 1950s  Decoration over the freight entrance on 51st Street 570 Lexington Avenue had opened to tenants by April 24, 1931, when RCA Victor moved to the space. RCA had rented ten floors in January 1931, but later modified the lease to occupy only three floors. Another long-term lessee was Childs Restaurants, who signed a 21-year lease for the ground-level retail space in July 1931. Other large companies took space at the building in its first year, including Seversky Aircraft, the White Sewing Machine Company, the National Civic Federation, and the national headquarters of the Girl Scouts of the USA. By late 1932, RCA and GE finalized an agreement in which RCA would move to Rockefeller Center and GE would take the Lexington Avenue building. RCA moved its offices out of 570 Lexington Avenue in June 1933 with the opening of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. In July and August 1933, GE moved its headquarters to the building. With this move, along with the opening of the adjacent Lexington Avenue station on the Independent Subway System's Queens Boulevard Line (now the ) the president of the Lexington Avenue Civic Association said that the \\"transformation\\" of the surrounding stretch of Lexington Avenue had been completed. Architects Pruitt & Brown filed plans in January 1935 to convert the top two floors into a clubhouse for the Elsun Society, a group of GE executives. By that year, 75% of space in the building was occupied, despite the economic downturn caused by the Great Depression. That July, the dining rooms on the 48th and 49th floors were heavily damaged in a fire, the highest ever fought by the New York City Fire Department at the time. Later in the 1930s, the Citizen Savings Bank opened a bank branch in the building. Other large tenants in the 1940s and 1950s included attorneys Reed, Crane De Give, as well as the Manhattan Savings Bank.  1960s to 1980s  An \\"automatic cafeteria\\" without a kitchen opened in the General Electric Building in 1961. The building's lights were replaced three years later, and GE moved some of its offices to two other Midtown buildings. By the early 1970s, GE considered constructing a new headquarters in Fairfield, Connecticut. The new headquarters opened in 1974, and the Canadian offices of GE moved to the space that the executive offices had vacated at 570 Lexington Avenue. In subsequent years, much of 570 Lexington Avenue's space subsequently became vacant. The General Electric Building's original granite storefronts were replaced with aluminum storefronts sometime before 1975. The windows of the other stories were replaced in the mid-1980s, and various features of the exterior were restored. The building's crown was not lit up between 1982 and 1988, when the building's renovation was nearly complete. Meanwhile, GE had purchased 30 Rockefeller Plaza in 1986 and renamed it the \\"GE Building\\" two years later. While employees of GE subsidiary NBC stated that the similar names could cause potential for confusion, a GE spokesperson said that there was precedent for two similarly named buildings in the city, and that in any case, 570 Lexington Avenue was popularly known as \\"570 Lex\\". Further confusing the situation, 30 Rockefeller Plaza's former name had been the RCA Building, but 570 Lexington Avenue had also been known by that name during its construction.  1990s to present  Seen from Lexington and 51st GE donated 570 Lexington Avenue to Columbia University in 1993 to gain a $40 million tax deduction. The university formed a joint venture with Bernard H. Mendik's Mendik Company and Quantum Realty Partners, and planned a renovation to attract tenants. Between 1993 and 1995, the building was extensively renovated by Ernest de Castro of the WCA Design Group. Several interior systems were refurbished, including the lobby and elevators. The renovation also added some elements, such as chandeliers, that had been planned but not installed in the original design. The exterior was also cleaned and refurbished, and several \\"miscellaneous modernizations\\" were removed. The adjacent 51st Street subway entrance was also rebuilt with an Art Deco design. For his company's preservation of the lobby, Mendik received the Preservation Achievement Award in 1996. By the end of 1995, Mendik and Quantum Realty were leasing out space within 570 Lexington Avenue. At the time, the building's yearly asking prices per square foot were described as being barely market rate, with being asked on the lower floors, and for the upper floors. Additionally, 570 Lexington Avenue was not located on such a prestigious street, and its design precluded modifications such as dropped ceilings, raised floors, or column removals. Vornado Realty Trust bought Mendik's company in 1997 and increased its ownership stake in 570 Lexington Avenue to a half stake in 1998. The Feil Organization bought the building in February 2001 for $120 million. By the 2010s, its tenants included Cornell University, Cornwall Capital, Asset.tv, Air India, and the Roosevelt Institute.  Impact  = Critical reception = At the time of its completion, the General Electric Building was characterized as being in a Gothic style, as the term \\"Art Deco\\" had not become popularized yet. A 1931 article in The New York Times described the building as being Gothic in design, as did the retail brochures issued by Cushman & Wakefield, which was originally in charge of leasing out the building's space. George Shepard Chappell, writing in The New Yorker under the pseudonym \\"T-Square\\", wrote that the General Electric Building was \\"Gothic in line and modern in detail\\". By the late 20th century, the General Electric Building was being described as Art Deco. In the 1978 Macmillian Encyclopedia of Architects, Christopher Gray described the building as \\"explicitly Art Deco\\". Reviews of the design were mostly positive. While Chappell wrote that the General Electric Building was \\"a little too consciously picturesque\\", he admired the building's rounded corner. Lewis Pilcher described the building in the 1931 Americana Annual as \\"superbly conceived [...] with grace and suavity.\\" Arnold Lehman wrote in 1971 that the building was \\"noteworthy for its highly original decorative treatment\\", saying that \\"the sculpted figures in the crown go as unnoticed as the beautifully detailed clock\\" on the building's northeastern corner. The AIA Guide to New York City stated that the building's \\"Art Deco details at both street and sky are both sumptuous and exuberant.\\" According to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), the building is a \\"major example\\" of Art Deco architecture and its style is \\"both symbolic and expressive of the building's function\\". Architecture writer Carter B. Horsley stated that the building's design was an \\"unofficial campanile to the church\\" immediately behind. = Landmark designations = The building's exterior was designated a New York City landmark by the LPC in 1985. Although separate \\"interior landmark\\" designations existed, the lobby was not designated as a landmark because of opposition from General Electric. 570 Lexington Avenue was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 28, 2004.

Paul of Aegina or Paulus Aegineta (; Aegina, ) was a 7th-century Byzantine Greek physician best known for writing the medical encyclopedia Medical Compendium in Seven Books. \\"He is the father of early medical books\\". For many years in the Byzantine Empire, this work contained the sum of all Western medical knowledge and was unrivaled in its accuracy and completeness. Life Nothing is known about his life, except that he was born in the island of Aegina, and that he travelled a good deal, visiting, among other places, Alexandria. cites: Paul of Aegina, iv. 49, p. 526 He is sometimes called Iatrosophistes and Periodeutes, a word which probably means a physician who travelled from place to place in the exercise of his profession. The exact time when he lived is not known; but, as he quotes Alexander of Tralles, cites: Paul of Aegina, iii. 28, 78, pp. 447, 495, vii. 5, 11, 19, pp. 650, 660, 687 and is himself quoted by Yahya ibn Sarafyun (Serapion the Elder), cites: Ibn Sarafyun, Pract. vii. 9, pp. 73, 74, ed. Lugd. 1525 it is probable that Abu-al-Faraj is correct in placing him in the latter half of the 7th century. cites: Abu-al-Faraj, Hist. Dynast. p. 114. Works The Suda says he wrote several medical works, of which the principal one is still extant, with no exact title, but is commonly called Medical Compendium in Seven Books (, Epitomes iatrikes biblia hepta). (Digital German edition by the University and State Library Düsseldorf) This work is chiefly a compilation from earlier writers; indeed its Greek title proclaims that it is an epitome of medicine, \\"epitomes iatrikes.\\" William Alexander Greenhill wrote that his reputation in the Islamic world seems to have been very great, and it is said that he was especially consulted by midwives, whence he received the name of Al-kawabeli or \\"the Accoucheur.\\" He is said by the Arabic writers to have written a work, \\"De Mulierum Morbis,\\" and another, \\"De Puerulorum Vivendi Ratione atque Curatione.\\" His great work was translated into Arabic by Hunayn ibn Ishaq. The sixth book on surgery in particular was referenced in Europe and the Arab world throughout the Middle Ages, and is of special interest for surgical history. The whole work in the original Greek was published in Venice in 1528, and another edition appeared in Basel in 1538. Several Latin translations were published. Its first full translation into English, was by Francis Adams in 1834. In this work he describes the operation to fix a hernia similar to modern techniques writing, \\"After making the incision to the extent of three fingers' breadth transversely across the tumor to the groin, and removing the membranes and fat, and the peritoneum being exposed in the middle where it is raised up to a point, let the knob of the probe be applied by which the intestines will be pressed deep down. The prominence, then, of the peritoneum, formed on each side of the knob of the probe, are to be joined together by sutures, and then we extract the probe, neither cutting the peritoneum nor removing the testicle, nor anything else, but curing it with applications used for fresh wounds.\\" Notes References * ()  * Further reading * () * () * () * * Category:625 births Category:690 deaths Category:Byzantine physicians Category:People from Aegina Category:7th-century Byzantine people Category:7th-century physicians Category:7th-century Byzantine scientists Category:7th-century Byzantine writers ","title":"Paul of Aegina"},{"id":"2193962","text":"Lliswerry (), or Liswerry is an electoral district (ward) and community of the city of Newport, South Wales. The area is governed by Newport City Council. It is the largest community/ward in the city.  History and origins  Lliswerry has been well known across the city for the railway bridge over Somerton Road with 'This is Lliswerry with 2 L's' painted in white across it. Lliswerry is an anglicised version of the place name Llyswyry translating to Maiden's Court. (Llys - Court, Gwyryf > Wyryf > Wyry - Maiden). It is believed that there was a manor house in the area belonging to the Welsh King of Brycheiniog. His daughter had connections to the manor/court. It was likely that the house was in the area of Traston Road today. The King public house on Somerton Road was sold to an anonymous telephone buyer in May 2013 for £140,000. The pub, which was once known as the King of Prussia, was used as a base by Newport County; before Somerton Park had changing rooms, teams would change at the pub then walk along Somerton Road to play. The club would hold social gatherings and also do their laundry there.  Community boundaries  The community is bounded by the River Usk to the west, Lilleshall Street and Telford Street to the northeast, the Great Western main line to the north, the original western end of Llanwern steelworks and Meadows Road to the east, and Nash Road, Traston Road, Corporation Road and Stephenson Street to the south. Lliswerry Ward is composed of both the Lliswerry and Nash communities and is represented by Cllr Ken Critchley, Cllr Roger Jeavons, Cllr Allan Morris and Cllr John Richards.  Schools and colleges  The ward is the site of the City of Newport Campus of Coleg Gwent (commonly referred to as 'Nash College') and the Newport International Sports Village. Lliswerry High School is adjacent to the college campus. Lliswerry also has a primary school, further north along Nash Road.  Churches  Lliswerry has four churches: St. Andrew's Church in Wales church, in the benefice of Newport, Maindee and Newport, Lliswerry, is situated in Somerton Road; Lliswerry Baptist Church in Camperdown Road; Saint Patrick's Catholic Church in Cromwell Road, the only parish administered by the Rosminians in Newport; and St Philip's Church in Wales church in Jenkin Street. Other amenities There is a Post Office at 63, Somerton Road and a medical centre on Fallowfield Drive. Lliswery Pond was formed, near the railway line, when quarrying excavations struck an underground stream which flooded that area. At its deepest point the pond is and it is well-stocked with fish, including large pike. The pond was refurbished in 2008 and is maintained by many enthusiasts, as well as the local angling association, Alway Community Association and Newport City Council.  Sport  The suburb is also home to the Newport International Sports Village and Newport Stadium which, from 1994 to 2012, was the home ground of the Newport County football team. Lliswerry A.F.C. are a football team which currently plays in the Gwent County League. Lliswerry Runners have club sessions which are organised into six groups and have a junior club which began in 2016.

Life He was born in Birmingham to John and Sarah Bedford, and followed his father into the iron trade to become a japanner in 1748. Bedford was perhaps best known for his work in the Mid Glamorgan area of South Wales, but he did not move there directly from his native Birmingham. His career progressed and by 1765 he had moved from Birmingham to Trostrey, in Monmouthshire, and was the manager of a forge. His property and business interests in Birmingham were now managed by his father and it was the sale of one of his properties that financed the purchase of a forge at Rogerstone, South Wales. He remained there until 1770 when he bought a estate in Cefn Cribwr, near Bridgend, where he planned to establish not only an iron works, complete with blast furnace and forge, but also the collieries, brickworks, mines and stone quarries to support it. Bedford, it seems, brought a sum of £36,000 to fund this venture and was possibly attracted to the area by the availability of local raw materials and its proximity to the sea via the harbor town of Porthcawl.Granville, 1980 The venture failed to reach its full potential due to a number of factors, which included John Bedford’s own eccentricity, the geographic position of the iron works, his reliance on borrowing and his lack of business acumen. His correspondence indicates that he was more interested in experimentation and development of the iron making techniques than running a viable business. Also apparent through his manuscripts of 1786 was his romantic thoughts about architecture, where he believed aesthetic beauty as important as functionality. Although not renowned for his success on business side of iron making he was recognised for his contributions to the iron industry through the vast amount of correspondence he left, now held at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. John Bedford died on 30 September 1791, at Digbeth, Birmingham, and was buried at Marston Chapel, Hall Green, Birmingham. His estate was divided between his wife and children and an area of his Cefn Cribwr estate was named Bedford Park, as a dedication to him. After his death the iron works and mine were sold off but the iron working continued until 1836. The brick making and coal mining, however, continued. His great-grandson was famed aeronautics engineer, Sir Morien Morgan.

Originally published by Penguin Books between 1983 and 1985, the titles are part of the Fighting Fantasy canon, but were not allocated numbers within the original 59-book series. Sorcery! was re-published by Wizard Books in 2003 and recreated as the Sorcery! video game series by Inkle. Publication history The Sorcery! series was published by Penguin Books (and later by their Puffin Books imprint) as four individual titles, beginning in 1983 with The Shamutanti Hills, followed by Kharé: Cityport of Traps and The Seven Serpents in 1984, and The Crown of Kings in 1985.Sorcery! series at Demian's Gamebook Web Page Each title could be played as an individual adventure or as part of the overall story arc. The series was supported by the Sorcery! Spellbook, published in 1983, which was eventually incorporated as an appendix into the four titles in later printings. A boxed set titled Sorcery! was released, containing both The Shamutanti Hills and the spellbook. The series was reissued by Wizard Books in 2003. Rules Sorcery! features several mechanics not present in previous Fighting Fantasy gamebooks. The principal difference is the ability to choose between playing as a warrior or a wizard. As a wizard, the player is weaker in combat, but has access to 48 spells, with each appearing as a three-letter word that has to be memorised by the player. Examples include ZAP (creates a lightning bolt from the finger) and HOT (creates a fireball).Jackson, Steve. The Sorcery Spell Book, Penguin Books, 1984. When given the option to cast spells the player is presented with a small selection of these three-letter words to choose from; the player is encouraged to choose from these without consulting the spell listing. It is also possible to fail to cast at all, as false spell words are placed alongside correct choices. Many spells also require a certain item (e.g. GOB requires one or more goblin teeth). If the character does not have the necessary equipment then the spell fails. All spell choices, irrespective of the outcome, incur a Stamina penalty. Warriors and wizards share the ability to call on the character's patron goddess, Libra, once each adventure. The goddess can perform a range of services, such as restoring lost Skill/Stamina/Luck points or curing a curse, or in specific locations, providing an automatic escape from that situation. The series features strong continuity: it is possible for a reader to use the same character – complete with any upgraded abilities and equipment – through each of the titles, and also use hidden clues found in one title to assist with a situation in another. Each title also features dice images at the bottom of each page, making it possible for the player to randomly \\"flick\\" through the pages for the equivalent of a dice roll. Plot The story is set on the fictional Fighting Fantasy world of Titan, on the continent known as The Old World. A powerful artifact known as the Crown of Kings, which bestows magical powers of leadership upon its owner, has been stolen from the land of Analand by the cruel Archmage of Mampang Fortress. With the Crown, the Archmage will be able to gain leadership of the lawless and brutal region of Kakhabad and begin an invasion of surrounding kingdoms. The player takes on the role of the lone hero, referred to only as the Analander, who has been dispatched to retrieve the Crown, thereby averting the invasion and saving Analand from terrible disgrace. The quest itself is divided between the four titles in the series: The Shamutanti Hills :Details the player's attempt to navigate the hills and plains surrounding Analand while defeating various monsters and avoiding traps. Kharé – Cityport of Traps :Relates the player's attempt to pass through the city of Kharé and find the four lines of a spell required to open the Northern Gate and allow an exit from the city. The Seven Serpents :The player crosses the Baklands, a vast and dangerous wasteland, attempting to find and defeat seven magical serpents: servants of the Archmage who are travelling to warn their master of the Analander's approach. The Crown of Kings :The final adventure details the player’s attempt to find and penetrate Mampang Fortress – stronghold of the Archmage – and defeat the enemy before reclaiming the Crown of Kings.

Süßkind von Trimberg (or Susskind of Trimberg) is given as the author of six poems in the Codex Manesse. The poems date to the second half of the 13th century, and if their purported author is historical, he would be the first documented Jewish poet of the German language. The town of is today part of the Elfershausen municipality, in Lower Franconia, Bavaria, at the time within the Bishopric of Würzburg. Historicity There are no records about Susskind's life and not even proof that the poems recorded under his name are from a single author. Yet Susskind (Süßkind) was a specifically Jewish name, and the spelling of the poems corresponds to an author raised in the Rhinelands, where Susskind is alleged to have come from. There is a Jewish motive in V,2, where the poet proclaims his intention to leave the courtly sphere and live humbly \\"in the manner of old Jews\\", possible allusions to Hebrew prayers in I,3. and, while wandering minstrels generally were unmarried, the poet praises his wife in III,2 and sings of the hunger of his children in V,1, which, if based on facts, would correspond to the Jewish religious obligation to marry and propagate. Written between 1250 and 1300, the poems were incorporated into the collection around 1330, when memories of their possible author could have still been prevalent. Frontispiece The frontispiece preceding Süßkind's works in the Codex Manesse (which is not to be taken as a portrait in the modern sense) identifies him as a Jew by means of a characteristically pointed Judenhut (the headgear which Jews were required to wear by law in the later German Middle Ages) and a long curled beard, also frequently associated with Jews. Though Süßkind refers to himself as an impoverished, itinerant minstrel in his verses, the painter depicts him wearing an expensive fur-lined cloak. The poet stands before a seated dignitary who is either a bishop or an abbot: he carries a crozier but lacks a mitre. This figure is enthroned under a standard which is variously said to be the flag of the town of Constance (whose bishop was closely associated with the codex), of Fulda (near Frankfurt/Main) or of the archbishop of Cologne. Two additional figures serve as intermediaries. All four figures gesticulate animatedly, denoting a lively exchange of words. The subject of their discourse is a matter of controversy. It has been interpreted as a recitation of verse by the poet before an episcopal audience; a legal proceeding between Süßkind and two Christians presided over by the bishop;Jahrmärker, Manuela. “Die Miniatur Süßkinds von Trimberg in der Manessischen Liederhandschrift.” Euphorion 81 (1987): 330-346. or a theological debate between Christianity and Judaism.Hausmann, Albrecht. “Das Bild zu Süßkind von Trimberg in der Manessischen Liederhandschrift.” In Kulturen der Manuskriptzeitalters. Ergebnisse der amerikanisch-Deutschen Arbeitstagung an der Georg-August- Üniversität Göttingen vom 17. bis 20. Oktober 2002, eds. Arthur Groos and Hans-Jochen Schiewer, 87-112. Göttingen: V&R; unipress, 2004. Poems While most of the content of Codex Manesse is Minnesang, Susskind was not a minnesinger, his poems belonging to the more general category of medieval Spruchdichtung. He sang of the worth of the virtuous wife (III,2), and of the hunger and misery of his children (V,1). There are possible allusions to Hebrew prayers and benedictions in his texts, as in I,3, where his comparison of the briefness of man's days and his salvation through God correspond to the 33rd benediction said on the eve of the Jewish New Year. He stated that nobility - and this at the high time of chivalry, in a collection where every singer of remotely noble descent is portrayed with a coat of arms - is not dependent on birth, but on one's deeds: “Nobility is not dependent on a piece of paper / Who acts nobly, him will I account noble.” In one of the last poems in the Codex (V,2) he bitterly complains that he fooled himself with his attempts to be an artist (\\"Ich var ûf der tôren vart / mit mîner künste zwâre\\"), that he is now determined to let his grey beard grow long and henceforth go his way humbly as a Jew, wrapped in a long coat, his hat pulled deep in his face, and won't sing any chivalrous (\\"hovelîchen\\") song, since the noblemen (\\"herren\\") won't grant him any further support. The most characteristic of his poems is the Fable of the Wolf, where a wolf complains about his bad reputation, and argues that he is innocent because he is forced to steal geese to survive, while the false man does much greater damage. Modern reception As the only Jewish poet of the Codex Manesse, Susskind was the subject of particular attention in scholarship since the 18th century. His historicity was controversially debated, his poems were translated into modern German and into Polish. Gerhardt (1997) is a summary of the history of the modern reception of the Susskind poems. Friedrich Torberg wrote a fictionalized biography of the poet, entitled Süsskind von Trimberg (Frankfurt am Main: Fischer, 1972).  Notes  References and further reading * Gerhardt, Dietrich.

Overview  There are different types of decomposition defined in computer sciences: * In structured programming, algorithmic decomposition breaks a process down into well-defined steps. * Structured analysis breaks down a software system from the system context level to system functions and data entities as described by Tom DeMarco.Tom DeMarco (1978). Structured Analysis and System Specification. New York, NY: Yourdon, 1978. , . * Object-oriented decomposition, on the other hand, breaks a large system down into progressively smaller classes or objects that are responsible for some part of the problem domain. * According to Booch, algorithmic decomposition is a necessary part of object-oriented analysis and design, but object-oriented systems start with and emphasize decomposition into objects.Grady Booch (1994). Object-oriented Analysis and Design (2nd ed.). Redwood Cita, CA: Benjamin/Cummings. pp.16-20. More generally, functional decomposition in computer science is a technique for mastering the complexity of the function of a model. A functional model of a system is thereby replaced by a series of functional models of subsystems.Jan Dietz (2006). Enterprise Ontology - Theory and Methodology. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.  Decomposition topics  = Decomposition paradigm = A decomposition paradigm in computer programming is a strategy for organizing a program as a number of parts, and it usually implies a specific way to organize a program text. Usually the aim of using a decomposition paradigm is to optimize some metric related to program complexity, for example the modularity of the program or its maintainability. Most decomposition paradigms suggest breaking down a program into parts so as to minimize the static dependencies among those parts, and to maximize the cohesiveness of each part. Some popular decomposition paradigms are the procedural, modules, abstract data type and object oriented ones. The concept of decomposition paradigm is entirely independent and different from that of model of computation, but the two are often confused, most often in the cases of the functional model of computation being confused with procedural decomposition, and of the actor model of computation being confused with object oriented decomposition. = Decomposition diagram = Image:6 Decomposition Structure.svgDecomposition Structure Image:21 Negative Node-Numbered Context.svgNegative Node-Numbered Context Image:Static, Dynamic, and Requirements Models for Sys Partition.jpgStatic, Dynamic, and Requirements Models for Systems Partition Image:Functions and Use Scenarios Mapping to Requirements and Goals.jpgFunctions and Use Scenarios Mapping to Requirements and Goals A decomposition diagram shows a complex, process, organization, data subject area, or other type of object broken down into lower level, more detailed components.

Although he is best known for his thrillers in collaboration with Lincoln Child (including the Agent Pendergast series and Gideon Crew series), he has also written six solo novels, including the Wyman Ford series and a novel entitled Jennie, which was made into a movie by Disney. He has authored a half-dozen nonfiction books on science and exploration and writes occasionally for The New Yorker, Smithsonian, and other magazines. Life and early career Preston was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts and grew up in Wellesley, Massachusetts. A graduate of the Cambridge School of Weston in Weston, Massachusetts, and Pomona College in Claremont, California, Preston began his writing career at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. From 1978 to 1985, Preston worked for the American Museum of Natural History as a writer, editor, and manager of publications. He served as managing editor for the journal Curator and was a columnist for Natural History magazine. In 1985 he published a history of the museum, Dinosaurs In The Attic: An Excursion into the American Museum of Natural History, which chronicled the explorers and expeditions of the museum's early days. The editor of that book at St. Martin's Press was his future writing partner, Lincoln Child. They soon collaborated on a thriller set in the museum titled Relic. It was subsequently made into a motion picture by Paramount Pictures starring Penelope Ann Miller, Tom Sizemore, and Linda Hunt. In 1986, Preston moved to New Mexico and began to write full-time. Seeking an understanding of the first moment of contact between Europeans and Native Americans in America, he retraced on horseback Francisco Vásquez de Coronado's violent and unsuccessful search for the legendary Seven Cities of Gold. That thousand mile journey across the American Southwest resulted in the book Cities of Gold: A Journey Across the American Southwest. Since that time, Preston has undertaken many long horseback journeys retracing historic or prehistoric trails, for which he was inducted into the Long Riders' Guild. He has also participated in expeditions in other parts of the world, including a journey deep into Khmer Rouge-held territory in the Cambodian jungle with a small army of soldiers, to become the first Westerner to visit a lost Angkor temple. He was the first person in 3,000 years to enter an ancient Egyptian burial chamber in a tomb known as KV5 in the Valley of the Kings. Preston participated in an expedition that led to the discovery of an ancient city in an unexplored valley in the Mosquitia mountains of Eastern Honduras, which he chronicled in a nonfiction book, The Lost City of the Monkey God: A True Story. On that expedition he and other expedition members contracted an incurable tropical disease known as mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, for which he received treatment at the National Institutes of Health. In 1989 and 1990 he taught nonfiction writing at Princeton University. He has been active in the International Thriller Writers organization. Writing career With his frequent collaborator Lincoln Child, he created the character of FBI Special Agent Pendergast, who appears in many of their novels, including Relic, The Cabinet of Curiosities, Brimstone, and White Fire. Additional novels by the Preston and Child team include Mount Dragon, Riptide, Thunderhead, and The Ice Limit. Later, the duo created the Gideon Crew series, which consists of Gideon's Sword, Gideon's Corpse, and The Lost Island. For his solo career, Preston's fictional debut was Jennie, a novel about a chimpanzee who is adopted by an American family. His next novel was The Codex, a treasure hunt novel with a style that was much closer to the thriller genre of his collaborations with Child. The Codex introduced the characters of Tom Broadbent and Sally Colorado. Tom and Sally return in Tyrannosaur Canyon, which also features the debut of Wyman Ford, an ex-CIA agent and (at the time) a monk-in-training. Following Tyrannosaur Canyon, Ford leaves the monastery where he is training, forms his own private investigation company, and replaces Broadbent as the main protagonist of Preston's solo works. Ford subsequently returns in Blasphemy, Impact, and The Kraken Project. In addition to his collaborations with Child and his solo fictional universe, Preston has written several nonfiction books of his own, mainly dealing with the history of the American Southwest. He has written about archaeology and paleontology for The New Yorker magazine and has also been published in Smithsonian, Harper's, The Atlantic, Natural History, and National Geographic. In May, 2011, Pomona College conferred on Preston the degree of Doctor of Letters (Honoris Causa). He is the recipient of writing awards in the United States and Europe. Involvement in the \\"Monster of Florence\\" case In 2000, Preston moved to Florence, Italy with his young family and became fascinated with an unsolved local murder mystery involving a serial killer nicknamed the \\"Monster of Florence\\". The case and his problems with the Italian authorities are the subject of his 2008 book The Monster of Florence, co-authored with Italian journalist Mario Spezi. The book spent three months on the New York Times bestseller list and won a number of journalism awards in Europe and the United States. It is being developed into a movie by 20th Century Fox, produced by George Clooney. Clooney will play the role of Preston. Involvement in the Amanda Knox case Preston has criticized the conduct of Italian prosecutor Giuliano Mignini\\"Tales from Italy’s Dark Side: Interview with Douglas Preston in the trial of American student Amanda Knox, one of three convicted, and eventually cleared, of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia in 2007. In 2009, Preston argued on 48 Hours on CBS that the case against Knox was \\"based on lies, superstition, and crazy conspiracy theories\\". In December 2009, after the verdict had been announced, he described his own interrogation by Mignini on Anderson Cooper 360° on CNN. Preston said of Mignini, \\"this is a very abusive prosecutor. He makes up theories. He's ... obsessed with satanic sex.\\"American Student Convicted of Murder in Italy; President Obama's Approval Numbers Sliding, Anderson Cooper 360° transcript “Operation Thriller” USO Tour In 2010, Preston participated in the first USO tour sponsored by the International Thriller Writers organization, along with authors David Morrell, Steve Berry, Andy Harp, and James Rollins. After visiting with wounded soldiers and giving away books at National Navy Medical Center and Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the group spent over a week in Kuwait and Iraq, marking “the first time in the USO’s 69-year history that authors visited a combat zone.” Of the experience, Preston said, “As always, we learn a great deal from all of the amazing and dedicated people we meet.” Authors United In 2014, during a disagreement over terms between Hachette Book Group and Amazon.com, Inc., Preston initiated an effort which became known as Authors United. During the contract dispute, books by Hachette authors faced significant shipment delays, blocked availability, and reduced discounts on the Amazon website. Frustrated with tactics he felt unjustly injured authors who were caught in the middle, Preston began garnering the support of like-minded authors from a variety of publishers. In the first open letter from Authors United, over 900 signatories urged Amazon to resolve the dispute and end the policy of sanctions, while calling on readers to contact CEO Jeff Bezos to express their support of authors. Not long after, a second open letter, signed by over 1100 authors, was sent to Amazon's board of directors asking if they personally approved the policy of hindering the sale of certain books. Describing the motivation behind the campaign, Preston explained: “This is about Amazon’s bullying tactics against authors. Every time they run into difficulty negotiating with a publisher, they target authors’ books for selective retaliation. The authors who were first were from university presses and small presses... Amazon is going to be negotiating with publishers forever. Are they really going to target authors every time they run into a problem with a publisher?” The Lost City of the Monkey God expedition In 2015, Preston took part in an expedition into the Mosquitia mountains of Honduras that penetrated one of the last scientifically unexplored areas on the surface of the earth. The expedition, led by Steve Elkins and sponsored by Benenson Productions, the Honduran government, and National Geographic magazine, explored a previously unknown pre-Columbian city built by a mysterious civilization that had been influenced by the Maya, but was not Maya itself. The city was discovered in an area long rumored to contain a legendary “lost city” known as La Ciudad Blanca, the White City, or the Lost City of the Monkey God. The extensive archaeological site, in a remote valley ringed by mountains, had been discovered in 2012 in an aerial overflight by a team using the powerful technology of lidar (light detection and ranging), able to map the terrain under dense, triple-canopy jungle. The 2015 expedition explored and mapped the city's plazas, pyramids, and temples. It also discovered a cache of stone sculptures at the base of the city's central earthen pyramid. When excavated in 2016 and 2017, the cache revealed over 500 sacred objects which appeared to have been ceremonially broken and left as an offering at the time the city was abandoned. Preston wrote about that discovery in his 2017 nonfiction book, The Lost City of the Monkey God: A True Story, which became a #1 New York Times bestseller. Preston was one of many on the expedition who contracted an aggressive parasitic disease, called mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, in the lost city.

It is a sequel to the 2000 video game Formula One 2000 and was based on the 2001 Formula One World Championship. This game is the last game to be released in North America until Formula One Championship Edition. In some editions, a DVD was given for free. The DVD offers a commentated review of the 2000 Formula One World Championship, race by race, with the option to toggle between viewing the main stream, an on-board car camera, view the pitlane or see on-screen data such as lap times and positions. These features were used in the former pay-per-view F1 Digital+'s interactive coverage. Gameplay The game's \\"arcade\\" mode followed a similar line to that of Formula One 2000, although incentives were now offered in the form of upgrades to the player's car. A new mode -- \\"Challenge\\" mode -- was introduced. In Challenge mode, players were given a lap around Spa- Francorchamps in Jenson Button's Benetton B201. Players who achieved a fast lap time were given a verification code, and the opportunity to post their winning times on the Internet to compare their times to other people's if they have an account. Development Formula One 2001 was created with the help of Benetton, Jaguar, Jordan and Arrows. Many of the employees from former franchise owner Psygnosis aided in the development. At the peak of development, the game was worked upon by 25 people with a majority of them being programmers and artists.Presenter: Walker, Murray: The Making of Formula One 2001 The game's engine was based upon a Research and Development project that began two years before the release of the game. This was to develop the physics, collision and A.I. for the game. Sony had an extensive reference library for the tracks including aerial photographs, close-ups of the tracks and over 200 hours of race footage from F1 Digital+. The PlayStation 2 graphical capabilities allowed the team to include more detail such as trackside details which were previously omitted and unique cockpit camera angles. Studio Liverpool managed to contact Formula One Administration who provided audio samples for all the cars. However, some of the audio samples provided were believed to be unsuitable. To rectify this, the developers spoke to Jordan and Prost and Sound Engineer Michael de Belle visited the garages to record the engine noises from the cars. The original PlayStation's central processing unit was used for sound processing. =Promotion= At the 2001 United States Grand Prix, Sony held a variety of sport promotions with Jenson Button and a multi-million advertising campaign. The advertising efforts in the United States included a national television campaign via network, cable and syndication sports programming. Promotions in print spreads and online advertising were also used. A Formula One 2001 American Challenge was held on 29 September 2001 in Castleton, Indiana. The event saw a time trial competition using the game and was played by Jenson Button against consumer Chris Ohanian. Ohanian made it into the final round by scoring one of the top 2 times but in the final, he was defeated by Button who set a lap time of 1:15.6 compared to Ohanian's 1:16.0. The game features all the drivers and tracks from the 2001 Formula One World Championship, although Tarso Marques' name is never mentioned by Murray Walker. Instead, on the PS1 version Murray Walker calls him \\"Minardi\\"; however, on the PS2 version nothing is mentioned. Depending on which version the player has, one of the replacement drivers (Pedro de la Rosa) that appeared in the real 2001 Formula One World Championship is in the game; however, drivers Ricardo Zonta, Alex Yoong and Tomáš Enge are not featured. In the European version of the game, released earlier in the year, Jean Alesi can be seen driving for the Prost Grand Prix while German driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen drives for the Jordan Grand Prix. In the American version, released on September of the same year, both drivers have switched roles as they also did in real life. On top of this, in the European version Luciano Burti drives for Jaguar Racing, while Gastón Mazzacane drives for the Prost Grand Prix. In the American version, however, Luciano Burti drives for the Prost Grand Prix while Pedro de la Rosa drives for Jaguar Racing as they both did in real life from the Spanish Grand Prix.

It exits the pelvic cavity through the lesser sciatic foramen. The internal obturator is situated partly within the lesser pelvis, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. It functions to help laterally rotate femur with hip extension and abduct femur with hip flexion, as well as to steady the femoral head in the acetabulum. Structure It arises from the inner surface of the antero-lateral wall of the pelvis, where it surrounds the greater part of the obturator foramen, being attached to the inferior pubic ramus and ischium, and at the side to the inner surface of the hip bone below and behind the pelvic brim, reaching from the upper part of the greater sciatic foramen above and behind to the obturator foramen below and in front. It also arises from the pelvic surface of the obturator membrane except in the posterior part, from the tendinous arch which completes the canal for the passage of the obturator vessels and nerve, and to a slight extent from the obturator fascia, which covers the muscle. The fibers converge rapidly toward the lesser sciatic foramen, and end in four or five tendinous bands, which are found on the deep surface of the muscle; these bands are reflected at a right angle over the grooved surface of the ischium between its spine and tuberosity. The tendon inserts on the greater trochanter of the proximal femur. The internal obturator muscle is also innervated by the nerve to internal obturator (L5, S1). Muscles of the gluteal and posterior femoral regions. =Bursa/bands= This bony surface is covered by smooth cartilage, which is separated from the tendon by a bursa, and presents one or more ridges corresponding with the furrows between the tendinous bands. These bands leave the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen and unite into a single flattened tendon, which passes horizontally across the capsule of the hip- joint, and, after receiving the attachments of the superior and inferior gemellus muscles, is inserted into the forepart of the medial surface of the greater trochanter above the trochanteric fossa. A bursa, narrow and elongated in form, is usually found between the tendon and the capsule of the hip-joint; it occasionally communicates with the bursa between the tendon and the ischium.

His long career led him to become one of Europe's leading opera stars. He also wrote a number of songs, of minor importance, although \\"The Death of Nelson\\" is still remembered. His success, and that of his offspring in marrying into the British aristocracy, are also notable examples of Jewish social mobility in the early 19th century. Origins Braham's precise origins are uncertain. The favoured (but specious) present account in contemporary sources of reference is that he was possibly a son of John Abraham or Abrahams, who was possibly an operative at the Drury Lane Theatre who died in 1779 and his wife, who may have been Esther, who may have been a sister of the hazzan at the Great Synagogue of London, Myer Lyon. Braham has also been held to be related to various other London musicians with the surname of Abrahams. There is however no documentary evidence for any of these supposed connections.Conway (2011), 78-82 It is however fairly certain that Braham was left an orphan at an early age. There are stories of his selling pencils in the street as an urchin (a common trade for the Jewish poor at the time). Braham was a meshorrer (descant singer) at the Great Synagogue, and here his abilities were noted by Lyon, who led a double life as an operatic tenor at the theatre at Covent Garden (under the name of Michaele Leoni). Early career John Braham, an etching by Robert Dighton Braham's first stage appearance was in fact at Leoni's Covent Garden 1787 benefit, when he sang Thomas Arne's The soldier tir’d of war’s alarms. He next appeared in June at the Royalty Theatre, again with Leoni.Conway (2011), 82 After 1788 however we do not hear of a public performance until Braham appeared at Bath under the aegis of his teacher, the male soprano Venanzio Rauzzini in 1794. This empty period will have coincided with the departure of Leoni and also with Braham's voice breaking. It also therefore suggests a birthdate of around 1774 or 1775, rather than the 1777 date given by nearly all modern sources. During this period he was supported by the Goldsmid family. The Goldsmids were influential financiers who maintained their friendship with Braham later in his career and also used him as entertainment at their soirées. Their neighbour and occasional guest there was Horatio Nelson, whose heroic fate was later to prompt Braham's greatest song-writing success, \\"The Death of Nelson\\". (It first appeared in the opera The Americans, (Lyceum Theatre, 1811). Lady Hamilton, who was in a private box for the performance, was reported to have been so overcome that she suffered a fit of hysterics and had to leave the theatre).Conway (2011), 82-3 Braham was trained by Rauzzini from 1794 to 1796. It is very likely in fact that the Goldsmids paid for Braham to be articled to Rauzzini, who was a leader in Bath's musical society. After his first performance at Bath in 1794, the Bath Chronicle eulogised him as ‘a sweet singer of Israel’ and explained that he derived […] from the synagogue, though by the simple expedient of dropping the A at the beginning of his name, he got rid of the patriarchal appellation and Christianized himself.Bath Chronicle, 15 December 1796, cited in James (1987), 31 At this point, despite the implications of the article, in fact Braham had made no moves to conversion, although he may well have attended church as social custom of the time required. Rauzzini's pupils included the celebrated Irish tenor Michael Kelly, creator of Don Basilio in Mozart's Marriage of Figaro. Braham certainly benefited from Rauzzini's influence and promotion, and acquired from him the basic precepts of the old Italian school and a virtuoso technique which was thought by some to be surpassed only by the soprano Angelica Catalani. Braham and the Storaces This 1794 performance also marked Braham's first encounter with the Storace family. Stephen Storace (1762–1796), the son of an Italian musician based in Dublin was an accomplished composer; and his sister Anna, known as Nancy (1765–1817), formerly also a student of Rauzzini, a talented soprano. They had already had much experience in Italy and in Vienna, where in 1786 Nancy created the first Susanna in Mozart's Figaro, and both had been friends of the composer. In Vienna Nancy had contracted an unfortunate marriage with the psychopathic English composer John Abraham Fisher, from whom she soon separated. At Braham's début, which was the first of the season at Bath, Nancy also performed, as a soloist and in a duet with him. It was the starting-point of a liaison which was to last for over twenty years, during which Nancy bore Braham a son, Spencer. Stephen invited Braham to take the lead role in his new opera Mahmoud in 1796; Braham triumphed at the première. Later that year he sang lead roles, also to acclaim, at the Italian Opera in London, an extraordinary attainment for a Briton. In 1797 he appeared in the role created for his mentor Leoni, as Carlos in Sheridan's The Duenna at Covent Garden. The long triumphant phase of Braham's career was launched, which in its early years saw him and Nancy singing in every major continental house as well as in Britain, to audiences which contained, in Paris (1797), Napoleon, in Livorno (1799), Nelson, and similar notables wherever else they appeared. Braham became the first English male singer to command a European reputation. In 1809 he sang in Dublin at the unheard of fee of 2000 guineas for fifteen concerts, an indisputable sign both of his fame and popularity, and of the growth of music and entertainment as industries in this period.Conway (2011), 84 Braham as a Jew However, both by his own choice and by the sentiments of his audiences in England, Braham's Jewishness remained a prominent feature of his career until his marriage in 1816, and as the most famous English Jew of this period he became a significant incarnation of 'the Jew' in the British consciousness. He also regularly supported Jewish charities and causes. Braham's physical appearance made it in any case difficult to disguise his origins, being short, stocky, swarthy and in general the epitome of a caricature Jew. The quality of his singing rendered his looks irrelevant to his audience; as was unpleasantly expressed by the satirist John Williams, who at the end of a long catalogue of supposed Jewish malpractices and some lubricious references to Braham's supposed venery, concludes his passage: His voice and his judgement completely atone For that heap of repulsion he cannot disown. [...] When he breathes his divisions and liquidly soars, Frigid Science first hears, then bows low and adores!Williams (1797), 99 The writer and essayist Charles Lamb is effusive, if patronising, about Braham in a letter of 1808: > Do you like Braham’s singing. The little Jew has bewitched me. I follow him > like as the boys follow Tom the Piper. He cures me of melancholy as David > cured Saul […]Braham’s singing when it is impassion’d is finer than Mrs. > Siddons or Mr. Kemble's acting & when it is not impassion'd it [is] as good > as hearing a person of fine sense talking. The brave little Jew!C. and > M.Lamb, (1975-8), II, 273 In his published essays however Lamb, whilst continuing to profess admiration for Braham, lets his prejudices rip. His attitude does not differ much, in fact, from that of Williams already referred to, accepting Braham’s talents only in the context of supposed distasteful practices of his people. In his essay ‘Imperfect Sympathies’ published in 1821, he wrote: > B–[raham] would have been more in keeping if he had abided by the faith of > his forefathers. There is a fine scorn in his face, which nature meant to be > of - Christians. The Hebrew spirit is strong in him, in spite of his > proselytism. He cannot conquer the Shibboleth. How it breaks out, when he > sings, \\"The Children of Israel passed through the Red Sea!\\" The auditors, > for the moment, are as Egyptians to him, and he rides over our necks in > triumph. There is no mistaking him. – B– has a strong expression of sense in > his countenance, and it is confirmed by his singing. The foundation of his > vocal excellence is use. He sings with understanding, as Kemble delivered > dialogue. He would sing the Commandments, and give an appropriate character > to each prohibition. Braham’s marriage Lamb had earlier attacked Braham rather more personally, and at some length, in the essay The Religion of Actors, not subsequently collected into the 'Elia' series. > A celebrated performer has seen fit to oblige the world with a confession of > his faith; or, Br–’s RELIGIO DRAMATICI. This gentleman, in his laudable > attempt to shift from his person the obloquy of Judaism, with the > forwardness of a new convert, in trying to prove too much, has, in the > opinion of many, proved too little. A simple declaration of his Christianity > was sufficient; but, strange to say, his apology has not a word about it. > [….] We can do no less than congratulate the general state of Christendom > upon the accession of so extraordinary a convert.C.and M. Lamb (1905), II, > 389 It is not known to what statement by Braham Lamb refers in this passage; no document or publication has been identified in which Braham writes of his religion. Nor, as Lamb hints, is there any evidence of Braham's actual conversion. However the passage is undoubtedly associated with Braham's marriage to (the Gentile) Miss Bolton of Manchester in 1816. This followed a traumatic period for Braham in which his personal affairs were often before the public. Having fallen out with, and abandoned, Nancy Storace, he had travelled to France in 1815 with a Mrs. Wright, whose husband sued him for criminal conversation (and eventually was awarded £1000).Conway (2011), 88-89 While the suit was pending, Braham had the unusual experience of being hissed during a performance of Handel's Israel in Egypt (the very piece cited by Lamb in his 1821 essay), on which he stepped forward and addressed the audience: > I am now before you in a public character. If, in that situation, I have > given you offence, you have an undoubted right to call for an apology or > defence; but if I have erred as a private individual, the nature of that > error cannot with discretion come under your notice. It will probably be > investigated by a court, constituted to hear both the accuser and the > accused, and where justice only can be done. Contemporary assessments of Braham’s singing Lamb clearly carried some baggage regarding Judaism which was not shared by (or at least not as evident in) most other writers of the time; on the three occasions he mentions Braham the latter's Jewish origin is always prominent. Lamb's friend Leigh Hunt admittedly takes the opportunity for some snide comments in his memories of Braham from the retrospect of 1850, when > from [the] wonderful remains of power in his old age we may judge what he > must have been in his prime. […]He had wonderful execution as well as force, > and his voice could also be very sweet, though it was too apt to betray > something of the nasal tone which has been observed in Jews, and which is, > perhaps […] a habit in which they have been brought up […] it might not be > difficult to trace it to moral, and even to monied, causes; those, to wit, > that induce people to retreat inwardly upon themselves; into a sense of > their shrewdness and resources; and to clap their finger in self- > congratulation upon the organ through which it pleases them occasionally to > intimate as much to a bystander, not choosing to trust it wholly to the > mouth. Other writers, such as Crabb Robinson or Mount Edgcumbe, mention Braham frequently without reference to his religion. Robinson writes in 1811: > His trills, shakes and quavers are, like those of all the other great > singers, tiresome to me; but his pure melody, the simple song clearly > articulated, is equal to anything I ever heard. His song was acted as well > as sung delightfully; I think Braham a fine actor while singing; he throws > his soul into his throat, but his whole frame is animated, and his gestures > and looks are equally impassioned. Mount Edgcumbe, in his memoirs, discriminates Braham's styles more closely: > All must acknowledge that his voice is of the finest quality […] he has > great knowledge of music and can sing extremely well. It is therefore the > more to be regretted that he should ever do otherwise, that he should ever > quit the normal register of his voice by raising it to an unpleasant > falsetto […], that he should depart from a good style and correct taste […] > to adopt at times the over-florid and frittered Italian manner; at others, > to fall into the coarseness and vulgarity of the English. The fact is, he > can be two different singers according to the audience before whom he > performs, and that to gain applause he condescends to sing as ill at the > playhouse as he has done well at the opera. In 1826 a writer in the Quarterly Musical Magazine and Review, in a letter entitled 'Foreign Instruction and English Judgement', states: > We have no English male vocalist who is entitled to the character of > impassioned but Braham […] I remember Braham before he went to Italy [i.e. > before 1798]. He was bred in the Italian school, but though he sung with > great feeling, he was young and exhibited more of what I would call > instrumentation than mind before he went abroad. All this is further evidence that Braham's singing showed similar traces of ‘otherness’ to that of Leoni, whose use of falsetto was also characteristic, and that this relic of Braham's early training was amongst the factors enabling him to present a singing style clearly demarcated, for the cognoscenti, from both the prevalent Italian and home-grown English styles. It further indicates that Braham was very conscious of his market, more so than he was for the purity of his art. In this of course he was no different from his many Gentile colleagues, and Mount Edgcumbe deplores him for his betrayal of art, not for his origins. However similar arguments against other musicians of Jewish origin were however also later to be given specific anti-Jewish spins in continental Europe. Braham's later career Following his marriage, Braham seems to have brought to a close any overt identification with the Jewish community. We do not find after this date appearances at Jewish charities or functions. This withdrawal also follows the publication of Byron's and Nathan’s Hebrew Melodies, to which he had lent his name (although he had no part in creating them) in return for a share of the profits. Despite the intention that Braham would publicise the songs there seems to be no record of his ever having performed them. His marriage, and the vehement anti- Jewish reviews which Byron's poetry received, may have both provided significant disincentives to do so. Although Nathan's first edition of the Melodies seems to have been profitable, Braham declined lending his name on the same terms to the second edition in 1824. Thus the year 1816 marks the turning of the tide as regards Braham's self-identification. Leigh Hunt, writing in 1850, gives an ironic indication of Braham's eventual Anglicization, dropping many of his Jewish mannerisms: > Byron would pleasantly pretend that Braham called 'enthusiasm' entoozy- > moozy; and in the extraordinary combination of lightness, haste, > indifference and fervour with which he would pitch out that single word from > his lips, accompanied with a gesture to correspond, he would really set > before you the admirable singer in one of his (then) characteristic passages > of stage dialogue. He did not live to see Braham become an exception in his > dialogue as in his singing.Hunt (1949), 354 Despite the dip in public support when he broke with Storace, Braham's reputation remained strong until at least the mid-1820s, when he created in London the role of Huon in Weber’s opera, Oberon and sang in Mozart’s Requiem at Weber's funeral service not long afterwards (June 1826). In the 1830s critics began to dispute whether his voice still served, and he began to abandon tenor roles for baritone parts. Poor investments, including an unhappy venture into theatre management at the St. James's Theatre, which he built in 1835, meant that he was forced to continue to exploit his reputation long after his voice could justify it, at times retiring to the continent to avoid bankruptcy proceedings. In 1840 he sang in Mendelssohn's Lobgesang (Second Symphony) at Birmingham under the composer's baton, and subsequently undertook a tour of America with his son Charles Braham. His last public performance was given in London in March 1852 (that is, when he was probably 78 years old) and he died there on 16 February 1856. He also worked as a singing teacher. Two of his notable pupils included mezzo-soprano Adelaide Kemble and soprano Fanny Corri-Paltoni. Braham continued to be dogged by the aftermath of the Storace affair, most notably through the antipathy, (fuelled by personal enemies), of his son by Storace, Spencer. Spencer ended up, having taken the surname Meadowes, as a canon of Canterbury Cathedral. Braham’s family Most notable of his children was his eldest daughter Frances (1821–1879). In a sequence of four brilliant marriages she wed the eldest, but illegitimate, son of the 6th Earl Waldegrave; then his brother, the 7th Earl; the elderly, wealthy and well-connected politician George Harcourt (1785–1861); and, finally, the politically ambitious Chichester Fortescue, later Lord Carlingford. (Asked once on which day of the week she had been married, she allegedly replied 'Oh, my dear, I have been married nearly every day of the week'). Restoring, with Harcourt, Horace Walpole's Strawberry Hill estate, which she had inherited from the Waldegraves, she became one of the leading society and political hostesses of her era. Gladstone, Disraeli, the Prince and Princess of Wales and the Duc d'Aumale, youngest son of Louis-Philippe, were all frequent guests. She was also a friend and patroness of the nonsense pioneer, Edward Lear. Her wealth enabled her to bail out her father and her various siblings on sundry occasions. But Frances's marriages were not the family's only social coup. Charles Braham's daughter Constance was married, with some help from her aunt, to Edward Strachey, later first Baron Strachie. The social transformation that had been achieved within a generation, the foundation of which was Braham's reputation and achievement as a musician, is obvious.  Legacy as a singer  The tenor Michael Kelly, who had a long professional association with Braham, remarked in 1826 that 'he is, decidedly, the greatest vocalist of his day.'H. van Thal, Solo Recital - The Reminiscences of Michael Kelly (Folio Society, London 1972, abridged edition), 207. John Braham became seen (retrospectively) as the founder of a dynasty of leading British tenors of the concert and oratorio stage. His immediate successor was the Englishman John Sims Reeves who sang into the 1880s. Reeves was succeeded by Edward Lloyd, who between 1874 and his retirement in 1900 took part in every Handel Triennial Festival at the Crystal Palace. Braham's 'Death of Nelson' remained in Lloyd's repertoire during the 1900s: in Lloyd's declamatory style, ringing but without much vibrato, there may be an echo of the stentorian style of Braham himself. In the early twentieth century the declamatory delivery in Handel's music was maintained by Walter Widdop and Joseph Hislop among others.

He was a governor of the State of México and a federal deputy. Early life and education Montiel is the son of Gregorio Montiel Monroy and Delia Rojas García. He received bachelor's degrees in public administration and accountancy from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in 1970. He married Maude Versini Lancry in 2002, a French journalist 31 years younger than he was. They divorced in September 2007. Political career As a politician, he was the mayor of Naucalpan and director of civil protection at the federal Ministry of the Interior. At the state level he was secretary of economic development and presided twice over the local branch of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). In 1999, during his gubernatorial campaign for the State of Mexico, he portrayed himself as a tough-on-crime candidate, using a series of radio spots in which he implied that criminals did not deserve human rights protection, saying \\"human rights are for humans, not for rats\\" (\\"rat\\" being common slang for \\"thief\\"). He won the election by simple majority and served from 1999 until 2005. On August 4, 2005, he was elected as candidate of Unidad Democrática, a political group challenging former PRI leader Roberto Madrazo for the party's candidacy for the 2006 presidential election. However, in a press conference held on October 20, he announced that he would no longer seek his party's nomination because of accusations leveled against his family in the media, including his ownership of several luxury apartments and mansions in Mexico and France. Among other businesses he granted construction of more than 5,000 homes in an ecologically preserved community in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, the Zona Esmeralda. These new communities, shopping malls and schools were constructed on what used to be green areas and forests. In 2013, Forbes magazine named Montiel as one of the 10 most corrupt Mexican politicians. Family Enrique Peña Nieto, the 57th president of Mexico, is Montiel's nephew.

It is located at latitude 40°21'24N longitude 71°17'5E, and at an elevation of 471 meters. A piece of ceramics from Rishton Rishton is one of the most famous and oldest centers of ceramics in Uzbekistan. Legend claims that the art is over 800 years old, passed down from generation to generation. A fine quality reddish- yellow clay deposit 1-1.5 meters deep and 0.5-1.5 meters thick underlies almost the whole Rishton area. The clay can be used without refinement or addition of other types of clay from other regions. Besides clay, the potters of Rishton extracted various dyes, quartz sand, and fire clay from the surrounding the mountains. One of the most popular Islamic Scholar Burhan al- Din al-Marghinani author of Hidaye was born in this small town and grew up in Margilan, a neighbor city in Fergana. The history of producing ceramics here goes back to the seventh century. In the late 19th – early 20th centuries, almost all the population of Rishton were potters. Its clay is suitable for making the whole variety of ceramic goods and the repertoire of ornamental patterns in the Rishton ceramics is one of the richest. Today, over 2000 craftsmen use both traditional techniques and modern machinery to produce over 5 million items per year. The traditional design has a blue-green glaze, called “iskor”. In the 1960s, this technique had almost died out, but has now recovered, thanks to the efforts of the artisans themselves. Main languages spoken in this area are Tajik and Uzbek.

View from the center of the main waterfall area. The Fort Worth Water Gardens, built in 1974, is located on the south end of downtown Fort Worth between Houston and Commerce Streets next to the Fort Worth Convention Center. The 4.3 acre (1.7 hectare) Water Gardens were designed by noted New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee and were dedicated to the City of Fort Worth by the Amon G. Carter Foundation. The urban park is frequently billed as a \\"cooling oasis in the concrete jungle\\" of downtown. Its focal points are three pools of water and a terraced knoll, which helps to shield the park from the rest of the City. Interstate 30 was relocated from its former site immediately adjacent to the Water Gardens, making the south end of the park quieter. The park now sits adjacent to Lancaster Avenue, recently landscaped and prepared for redevelopment. The quiet, blue meditation pool is encircled with cypress trees and towering walls that are covered in thin plane of water that cascades almost 90 degrees down to the sunken blue water feature. The sound of the water on the walls evokes thoughts of a gentle rain shower. The aerating pool features multiple illuminated spray fountains under a canopy of large oak trees. The main attraction of the Water Gardens is the active pool which has water cascading 38 feet (11 m) down terraces and steps into a small pool at the bottom. The active pool experience was built for people to be able to walk down the terraced steps to be surrounded by and experience the power, sounds and motion of water crashing around them. In March 1991, Larry James Watkins, 43, of Greensboro N.C. was one of two people killed when the light pole toppled about 6 p.m. in gusty winds. Two other people - one from Mississippi, the other from California - were injured. Mr. Watkins, an Alamance County native and a graduate of N.C. A&T; State University, had been with the IRS since 1970. As a disclosure officer for the IRS's Greensboro district, his job was to make sure that taxpayer information remained confidential. Libby Watson, an assistant Fort Worth city manager, said Friday that investigators had not determined what caused the metal pole to snap at the base and fall. She said, though, that the wind may have contributed. \`\`I'm afraid it's too early to speculate' on the cause, she said. A South Carolina man also was killed by the falling pole. The pole was one of six at Fort Worth Water Garden, a 4.3-acre multilevel concrete and stone park built in the downtown area in 1975. The park was closed following the accident and the other five light poles will be taken down, Watson said. The park was temporarily closed to the public after four people died there on June 16, 2004. Three children and one adult drowned after one of the children fell in the pool. The water was unusually deep due to a recirculating pump malfunction and heavy rains. The park was reopened on March 4, 2007 after being made safer by reducing the depth of the main pool from to .

ISL is Cisco's VLAN encapsulation protocol and is supported only on some Cisco equipment over the Fast and Gigabit Ethernet links. It is offered as an alternative to the IEEE 802.1Q standard, a widely used VLAN tagging protocol, although the use of ISL for new sites is deprecated by Cisco.CCNA Exploration LAN Switching and Wireless course, v 4.0, sec 3.2.3 With ISL, an Ethernet frame is encapsulated with a header that transports VLAN IDs between switches and routers. With IEEE 802.1Q the tag is internal. This is a key advantage for IEEE 802.1Q as it means tagged frames can be sent over standard Ethernet links. ISL does add overhead to the frame as a 26-byte header containing a 10-bit VLAN ID. In addition, a 4-byte CRC is appended to the end of each frame. This CRC is in addition to any frame checking that the Ethernet frame requires. The fields in an ISL header identify the frame as belonging to a particular VLAN. A VLAN ID is added only if the frame is forwarded out a port configured as a trunk link. If the frame is to be forwarded out a port configured as an access link, the ISL encapsulation is removed. The size of an Ethernet encapsulated ISL frame can be expected to start from 94 bytes and increase up to 1548 bytes because of the overhead (additional fields) the protocol creates via encapsulation. ISL adds a 26-byte header (containing a 15-bit VLAN identifier) and a 4-byte CRC trailer to the frame. ISL functions at the data-link layer of the OSI model. Another related Cisco protocol, Dynamic Inter-Switch Link Protocol (DISL), simplifies the creation of an ISL trunk from two interconnected Fast Ethernet devices. Fast EtherChannel technology enables aggregation of two full-duplex Fast Ethernet links for high-capacity backbone connections. DISL minimizes VLAN trunk configuration procedures because only one end of a link needs to be configured as a trunk.

He is remembered today for a single tune, the familiar \\"Jalousie\\", also known as Jalousie 'Tango Tzigane' and Tango Jalousie.Tango Jalousie was also the name of a Danish feature film produced in 1944 and a Danish short subject by animator Jannik Hastrup Early life Jacob Thune Hansen Gade was born in Vejle, Denmark on 29 November 1879 and died on 20 February 1963. He belonged to a family of musicians. His grandfather and his father used to go around the nearby villages to play at all kinds of parties. And it was natural that, from an early age, he also began to play and was another member of the musical group. He was 9 when he made his debut as trumpeter. He might have been an attraction because only a year later he was invited to Copenhagen to become a soloist in the orchestra of the Tivoli Garden, a famous amusement park. It was only at age 12 when he began to study violin, firstly with his father and later with teachers of greater knowledge. Soon he evidenced his ambition, he wanted to be recognized and for that he decided to move to the capital. Music composer He began to compose country music, polkas and similar rhythms. With a scarce capital he left hurrying up his fate. He dreamed of being an orchestra conductor, and of writing waltzes, by then he was convinced that it was the best music in the world. He had a hard time, at night, he used to sleep at the entrance of buildings, at the hall near the stairs. He started to work at small cafeterias and, about two years later, when he was only 18, he began to be connected with people who summoned him to play at an operetta in Frederiksberg, the night center of entertainment at that time. A prolific composer, in 1900, for the first time a toast song of his was published titled “Der er sollys i modne druer” (There is sunshine in ripe grapes), with lyrics by his finder, Lorry Feilberg. It turned out a very popular song and, among others, it was sung by Elna From, a theater actress ten years older than he, who was his first love. Although they never married, he had three children with her. They separated in 1906 and two years later, in Christiania, then capital of Norway, he married another actress: Mimi Mikkelsen, with whom he lived until she died in 1951. Orchestras He joined several orchestras up to 1903 when he already led his own. He didn't change his orientation; he was creator and diffuser of danceable music. In 1909, the recognition he achieved by his work got him hired by the famous Hotel Bristol, located in front of the main plaza of Copenhagen. In order to enhance his musical knowledge he turned to maestro Max Schlüler, an important concert player. Gade was already 30 and was too old to become a concert instrumentalist of classical music. Some time before, for the same reason he had not been accepted in the Royal Conservatory of Danish Music. In 1914 he began to lead orchestras that played at theaters and as well at the most important cinema theaters as accompaniment to silent films. At the same time he performed a series of concerts as soloist, including a Paganini composition. As composer he was in a period when he wrote waltzes with a title in French. He adopted several pseudonyms, like Maurice Ribot, Leon Bonnard, James Wellington, Fred Marshall and Jascha Tjenko. He used to say that they made him widely known and provided him with an international touch. The principal paper of the city mentioned him as the king of waltz. His juvenile dream was coming true. In 1919 he traveled to New York, joined orchestras that played at cinema theaters, and put together aggregations that included up to 80 members, and soon he had another satisfaction, he was chosen in a contest to join the Philharmonic Orchestra of New York. For two years he only devoted to playing classical music. He returned to his country to conduct the orchestra of the Palads Cinema theater and to compose and arrange music to be played during the projection of movies. By that time he composed “Jalousie”. They say that its title had inspired the melody. He was on leave in Christiania, near a windmill far from the city, when he read on a paper that a man had murdered his wife because of jealousy. His golden period lasted until 1929 when sound films arrived. But it scarcely affected him. In 1931 he opened the National Scala theater, and there he continued to play entertainment music for dancing. His career as orchestra leader and player before public audiences ended by his own decision. Worldwide hit His tzigane tango “Jalousie” was a worldwide hit. Performed for the first time on Monday 14 September 1925 at the premiere of the American movie Don Q. Son of Zorro, starring Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Astor, it placed Denmark in the world map of music. His royalties as composer were so ample that in the 70s it was estimated that the song was played, at least, once every minute on some radio of the planet. After “Jalousie” he devoted solely to musical composition, retired and based in a country house. There, among others, were born “Rhapsodietta” and another tango “Romanesca” which were published in Copenhagen and in Paris. He returned to the United States of America in 1939 where they offered to publish his whole output. On 8 April 1940 he returned to his country. The following day the Nazis invaded Denmark. He endured it by settling on the Fiskerleje island where he continued composing. There a successful waltz was born: “Capricious”. Also other tangos: “El matador”, “Tango charmeuse”, “Lille Mary Anne”, “Laila” and “Tango Glamour”. “Jalousie” was born as an instrumental, but later in every country a lyric was written, according to their taste and commercial preference. This is the case of the above-mentioned Vera Bloom for the previously cited Frankie Laine. In Finland a lyric written by Kuliervo is known. In Great Britain, the then famous orchestra led by Gerald Bright presented his vocalist Monterrey (his true name was Montgomery) singing a lyric by E. Way and so appeared many others of the kind. In our country its instrumental form was always respected. We highlight the renditions of the Sexteto Mayor; Nito Farace's who made an original delicate arrangement featuring the soloist Simón Bajour on violin; Osvaldo Requena's with Fernando Suárez Paz on violin; Francisco Lomuto's and Florindo Sassone's which has a good tango flavor but the violin is hardly heard. The piece possesses beauty because of its violin solos, without them the number is deprived of its charm. The boom of “Jalousie” stirred up a legal conflict with the Danish publishing house Wilhelm Hansen to which Gade had granted the royalties of all the pieces he would compose until a certain date. The composer did not stick to what was agreed and published “Jalousie” by his own publishing house, Gade & Warny, thinking that the contract had expired, on the same day of the above-mentioned premiere. The issue was solved after Gade yielded a part of his royalties. The number was included totally or partially in over 100 movies, in numerous television series and on all new ways of playing back since records appeared. Estate When he drew up his will in 1956, he included his wish that all his estate and future royalties were granted to a foundation that had to be created under his name to sponsor young talented musicians. Explaining that reason, he said: «I still remember the financial and educational difficulties I had when I was young, when I arrived in Copenhagen with the purpose of making a living with music». With his will he opened a bank account with the deposit of 100,000.00 DDK. In 1993 the publishing house founded by Gade sued Hansen's for the huge figures that the latter collected as royalties from “Jalousie”, but the court passed judgment against the former. Agreements had to be respected. Every year the foundation holds a contest for young violinists in Gade's hometown. On 8 November 1970 a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of his birth was issued. There is a peculiar arrangement of “Jealousy” for a woodwind quintet which was premiered on the celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the accession to the throne of the queen Margaret of Denmark, in the Elsinore Castle in June 1992. Recordings In 1998 Dacapo Recordings published a record with a part of his works—some unpublished—, performed by the Odense Symphonic Orchestra conducted by Mathias Aeschbacher featuring the soloist Bjarne Hansen on violin. Critics commented: «It is incredible that an unknown and so good music has been displayed because of the popularity of “Jealousy”». Written to accompany the silent era blockbuster Son of Zorro when Gade was leader of the orchestra of the Palads Cinema,det Kongelige Bibliotek: Jacob Gade the tango premiered on 14 September 1925 and was an instant international hit. When talkies were introduced it was featured in numerous films. Music composition The royalties allowed Gade to devote himself to composition full-time for the rest of his life. Arthur Fiedler made the first recording of the piece with the Boston Pops in 1935, further increasing Gade's income. The royalties now fund a foundation for young musicians. As a symphony composer Gade did not fare as well. In an interview two years before his death, Fiedler recalled that Gade came especially to Boston to thank him for the recording. Gade also presented Fiedler with a score of a symphony which Fiedler recalled as \\"one of the worst pieces of music I ever looked at\\".\\"Fiedler: Builder of America's Musical Bridges\\".

History Süsskind in the German medieval period was a given name, not a surname, specifically recorded as carried by Jews since the early 13th century. A Jew named Süsskind is recorded as a physician in the hospital of Würzburg in 1218. Süsskind, the Jew of Trimberg (Middle High German Sueskint der Jude von Trimperg) is one of the minnesingers whose work is compiled in the early-14th-century Codex Manesse. This poet is otherwise unknown, and there is no proof that the poems recorded under his name are from a single author, but the language of the poems is consistent with an author of the second half of the 13th century native to the Rhineland. There is also a Jewish motif in V.2, where the poet proclaims his intention to leave the courtly sphere and live humbly \\"in the manner of old Jews\\", besides possible allusions to Hebrew prayers in I.3. Süsskind remained a widely-used given name among German-speaking Jews into the 19th century. Beginning in the 18th century, some Jews adopted Süsskind as a patronymic surname.Gershom Scholem, Briefe, Band III 1971-1982 (1999), p. 219. Süsskind ceased to be used as a given name around mid-19th-century.One Süßkind Grünebaum, born 1815 in Hanau, is recorded as having legally changed his name to Alexander in 1838. Ludwig Rosenthal, Zur Geschichte der Juden im Gebiet der ehemaligen Grafschaft Hanau, Hanauer Geschichtsverein (1963), p. 173. The baronial family of Süßkind is descended from Johann Gottlieb Süßkind, a cousin of theologian Friedrich Gottlieb Süskind, who was given the title of nobility by the king of Bavaria in 1821. The family is descended from one Michael Süßkind, recorded as a citizen of Esslingen in 1425. The surname was introduced to the United States by the 1880s.Heiman (Chaim Shmuel) Susskind (1847-1939), migrated from Tarnów, Poland to New York in 1885.

Franz stated the request for his resignation and his subsequent disfellowshipping resulted from allegations of apostasy. Following his removal, Franz wrote two books that related his personal experiences with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and his views on Jehovah's Witnesses teachings. Watch Tower career Franz was born in 1922. His uncle, Frederick Franz, was influential in the denomination's development, practices and doctrines. His father associated with the Bible Student movement (from which Jehovah's Witnesses developed) and was baptized in 1913. Franz joined the Jehovah's Witnesses in 1938, and became a baptized member in 1939. In 1944 Franz graduated from Gilead, the group's school for training missionaries,\\"Gilead’s 61st Graduation a Spiritual Treat\\", The Watchtower, November 1, 1976, page 671. and temporarily served the organization as a traveling representative in the continental United States until receiving a missionary assignment to Puerto Rico in 1946. Franz became a representative of Jehovah's Witnesses throughout the Caribbean, traveling to the Virgin Islands and the Dominican Republic, until at least 1957 when Jehovah's Witnesses were banned in the Dominican Republic by dictator Rafael Trujillo. At the age of 37, Franz married his wife, Cynthia, who joined him on missionary work. Both returned to the Dominican Republic in 1961 to evangelize for four more years and were then assigned to Watch Tower headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. According to Franz, he began working in the organization's writing department and was assigned to collaboratively write Aid to Bible Understanding, the first religious encyclopedia published by Jehovah's Witnesses. On October 20, 1971 he was appointed as a member of the Governing Body. In his personal memoir, Franz said that at the end of 1979 he reached a personal crossroad: Frustrated by what he viewed as the Governing Body's dogmatism and overemphasis on traditional views rather than reliance on the Bible in reaching doctrinal decisions, Franz and his wife decided in late 1979 they would leave the international headquarters. Expulsion In March 1980, Franz and his wife took a leave of absence from the world headquarters for health reasons and moved to Alabama, where he took up laboring work on a property owned by a fellow Witness. The following month, a committee of the Governing Body raised concerns about \\"wrong teachings\\" being spread by headquarters staff and began questioning staff about their beliefs. Staff were also questioned about comments Franz had made that may have contradicted Watch Tower doctrine. The March 15, 1980 issue of The Watchtower issued a statement of regret that its assertions of probability of Armageddon arriving before 1975 had \\"apparently overshadowed the cautionary ones and contributed to a buildup of expectation already initiated.\\"p. 17 It told disappointed Jehovah's Witnesses, \\"including persons having to do with the publication of the information that contributed to the buildup of hopes centred on that date\\" to \\"concentrate on adjusting his viewpoint\\".pp. 17-18 This statement, which placed blame for the disappointment about 1975 on Raymond Franz as the former chairman of the writing committee, precipitated a purge of that committee.The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses, pp. 48-49, 158-163 On May 8, 1980, Franz was told that he had been implicated as an apostate. He was called back to Brooklyn on May 20 for two days of questioning by the Chairman's Committee. According to Franz, the discussion involved allegations that some Witnesses were meeting privately to discuss various teachings of the Watch Tower Society that may have constituted apostasy. On May 21, 1980, Franz was called to a Governing Body session where he was questioned for three hours about his biblical viewpoints and commitment to Watch Tower doctrines. Consequently, he agreed to a request to resign from the Governing Body and headquarters staff. Franz refused the Watch Tower Society's offer of a monthly stipend as a member of the \\"Infirm Special Pioneers\\". The Governing Body investigation resulted in the disfellowshipping of several other headquarters staff.\\"Branch Letter\\", Our Kingdom Ministry, August 1980, \\"We are saddened to report at this time that five members of the Bethel family, and a few others in the New York city area have recently been disfellowshiped. There has been some apostasy against the organization and the promoting of sectarian divisions in some of the congregations of God’s people. (Titus 3:9-11) Living as we are in times difficult to deal with, it should not be surprising that such things occur. The first-century congregation also experienced deviations as we well know from our reading of the Holy Scriptures.—1 Tim. 1:20; 4:1; 2 Tim. 2:17, 18; 1 Cor. 15:12, 13; Acts 20:29, 30.\\" On September 1, 1980, the Governing Body distributed a letter to all Circuit and District overseers stating that apostates need not be promoting doctrines to be disfellowshipped. The letter stated that individuals who persisted in \\"believing other doctrine despite scriptural reproof\\" were also apostatizing and therefore warranted \\"appropriate judicial action\\".Protecting the Flock, Watch Tower Society letter to district and circuit overseers, September 1, 1980, part 1. Protecting the Flock, Part 2. On March 18, 1981 Franz' employer in Alabama submitted a letter of disassociation from Jehovah's Witnesses. The September 15, 1981 issue of The Watchtower announced a change of policy on disassociation, directing that those who formally withdrew from the group were to be shunned by Witnesses in the same manner as those who have been disfellowshipped.\\"Disfellowshiping — How to View It\\", The Watchtower, September 15, 1981, page 23, \\"One who has been a true Christian might renounce the way of the truth, stating that he no longer considers himself to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or wants to be known as one. When this rare event occurs, the person is renouncing his standing as a Christian, deliberately disassociating himself from the congregation ... Persons who make themselves 'not of our sort' by deliberately rejecting the faith and beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses should appropriately be viewed and treated as are those who have been disfellowshiped for wrongdoing.\\" Franz, who continued to socialize with his employer, was summoned to a judicial hearing on November 25 and disfellowshipped for disobeying the edict.\\"Expelled Witnesses Claim Group is Ingrown\\", Miami News, March 19, 1983. Determined to present his point of view, not only with respect to his having been disfellowshipped, but with respect to broader doctrinal issues, in 1982 he sent Heather and Gary Botting proofs of his book Crisis of Conscience so that they could chronicle the more widespread discord within the Watch Tower Society.the Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses, pp. 161–163 They wrote regarding Franz' contribution to their exposé on the Witnesses that his recommendations \\"undoubtedly strengthened the veracity of the text; we were impressed by his insistence on both fairness and frankness with respect to representing the view of the Watch Tower Society.\\"The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses,p. xxiii After he was disfellowshipped, Franz published two books--Crisis of Conscience (1983) and In Search of Christian Freedom (1991)--presenting detailed accounts of his experiences as a Jehovah's Witness, a Governing Body member, and his experiences throughout various levels of the organization.

The town consists mainly of facilities for the workers and companies that operate at the nearby Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. Deadhorse is accessible via the Dalton Highway from Fairbanks, south, or Deadhorse Airport. Limited accommodation is also available for tourists. The permanent population is variously listed as being between 25 and 50 residents. Temporary residents (employed by various firms with local interests) can range as high as 3,000. Companies with facilities in Deadhorse service Prudhoe Bay, nearby oil fields, and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), which brings oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez on the south-central Alaska coast. Facilities in Deadhorse are built entirely on man-made gravel pads and usually consist of pre-fabricated modules shipped to Deadhorse via barge or air cargo.  History  The Prudhoe Bay, Alaska area was developed to house personnel, provide support for drilling operations, and transport oil to the Alaskan pipeline. Prior to 1977, oil seeps (small pores or fissure networks through which liquid petroleum emerges at the surface of the land) on the Arctic coastal plain had caught the attention of the U.S. petroleum interests. The U.S. Navy drilled for oil between 1944 and 1953 with little success. However, in 1967, after several attempts at drilling for oil, oil company mergers, and competitive bidding for state lease sales, the Prudhoe Bay oil field was discovered. Sources conflict on the origin of the area's name. The most cited theory appears to be that the area takes its name from a local business prominent in the late 1960s and 1970s, the \\"Dead Horse Haulers\\" trucking company.http://uaf- db.uaf.edu/Jukebox/haul_road_07/assets/docs/bc_deadhorse.pdf How the trucking company got its name remains in dispute. Demographics Deadhorse first appeared on the 1970 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It was made a census-designated place (CDP) in 1980. It appeared last on the 1990 census. After 2000, it was merged into the Prudhoe Bay CDP.  Tourism and wildlife  Arctic foxes are among the wildlife sometimes seen in the Deadhorse area. Tourists traveling to Deadhorse and Prudhoe Bay typically take tour buses from Fairbanks via the James Dalton Highway, a two-day journey with an overnight stop in Coldfoot. During the summer months, visitors can arrange for tours to the Arctic Ocean via a guided tour only. There is no longer any public Arctic Ocean access from Deadhorse. All tours must be booked 24 hours in advance to allow time for background checks on all passengers going through the oilfield check point. Tourists can also experience the midnight sun due to Deadhorse's location above the Arctic Circle. In winter, the opposite phenomenon, polar night, occurs. The area often features large herds of caribou and over 200 bird and waterfowl species, including geese, swans, gulls and eagles.http://www.prudhoebay.com/communities_Deadhorse.htm Deadhorse, Alaska website Other indigenous wildlife include Arctic foxes, Arctic ground squirrels, grizzly bears, polar bears, musk oxen, and Arctic hares. Because alcoholic beverages are not sold in Deadhorse, a humorous slogan for the town is \\"All that far and still no bar.\\" This is the beginning or end of an Iron Butt Association motorcycle rider challenge called \\"The Ultimate Coast to Coast\\". This ride starts from Key West, Florida, and gives riders 30 days to reach Deadhorse, Alaska. It is also the midpoint of the \\"Haul Road 1000\\" and the beginning or end of the \\"Alaska Insanity Gold\\" challenge (riders allotted 24 hours for those two challenges).

It is found in EMS Region 6A in the North Slope Region. Emergency Services have limited highway, coastal, and airport access. Emergency service is provided by paid EMS service and Fairweather Deadhorse Medical Clinic (open daily and on call 24 hours a day [907-685-1800] for emergencies and urgent care). Auxiliary health care is provided by oil company medical staff and the Greater Prudhoe Bay Fire Dept. Individuals requiring hospital care are usually transported to the nearest hospital/medical center, Sammuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital, in Utqiagvik, Alaska. Because no roads connect Deadhorse to Utqiagvik, individuals are transported by plane or helicopter (an approximately 45 minute flight).

Bernazard served as an assistant to Mets general manager Omar Minaya before being dismissed on July 27, 2009. Playing career During his ten-year major league career, Bernazard played second base, shortstop, and designated hitter for the Montreal Expos, Chicago White Sox, Seattle Mariners, Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, and Detroit Tigers. He hit 75 home runs in 3,700 at-bats with 523 runs, 177 doubles, 30 triples, 391 RBI, 113 stolen bases and 428 bases on balls. His career hitting line (BA/OBP/SLG) stands at .262/.339/.387. Bernazard missed out on the Chicago White Sox divisional pennant run of 1983 when he was traded to the Mariners for second baseman Julio Cruz on June 15 of that year.Sox deal Bernazard to Mariners The speedier Cruz helped spur the Sox to win the division by 20 games. In 1984 with the Indians, he went through an 0-for-44 stretch at the plate, tying a major league hitless streak for non-pitchers in the last 50 years. He hit only .221 that year. He rebounded to have two productive seasons with the Indians, batting .274 in 1985 and a career-high .301 in 1986, while also hitting 17 home runs. Inexplicably, Topps pictured Bernazard as an American League All Star in its 1987 set (card number 607) though Bernazard was not named to the American League All Star Team in 1986 or any other season. From 1988–1990, he played for the Nankai/Fukuoka Daiei Hawks (now the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks) in the Japanese Pacific League. After a brief major league comeback in 1991 with the Tigers, in which he went 2-for-12 in six games, his career was over. Front office career Bernazard became the vice president of development for the New York Mets in December 2004 after serving as a special assistant to general manager Omar Minaya. During the 2004 off-season, then-free agent first baseman Carlos Delgado was offended when Bernazard—a fellow Puerto Rican—attempted to gain an advantage in wooing Delgado to the Mets by utilizing what Delgado termed \\"street Spanish.\\" Delgado was heavily critical in public of the Mets negotiating tactics. He reportedly referred to Bernazard as \\"the highest-paid translator on the planet\\" after meeting him and Minaya for a face-to-face negotiating session at baseball's Winter Meetings. Bernazard, who was known for his flamboyant antics around the Mets offices and Shea Stadium, downplayed the incident. Bernazard came under scrutiny again during the 2008 season, when it was reported that he was allegedly the person who orchestrated the firing of then Mets manager Willie Randolph. Bernazard came under renewed scrutiny in late July during the 2009 season after removing his shirt and challenging several Binghamton Mets players to fights. The same week Bernazard had another tirade at Citi Field when a Diamondbacks scout occupied a seat that he wanted and one of his deputies suggested to him that he wait until the end of the half inning, prompting Bernazard to become angry. In addition, Bernazard had an angry confrontation with Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez on the team bus, while returning to the team's hotel after an 11–0 loss to the Atlanta Braves. The Mets organization issued a statement by general manager Minaya saying, in part, \\"I spoke with Tony [Bernazard] this morning and informed him of my decision to terminate his employment with the Mets\\", confirming an earlier report. At the press conference announcing the firing, Minaya angrily challenged the accuracy of past news reports, claiming that New York Daily News reporter Adam Rubin, who initially broke the story about Bernazard challenging Binghamton Mets players to a fight, was angling for a position in the Mets organization, a claim Rubin denied. Omar Minaya fired Bernazard from the Mets on Monday July 27, 2009. Post-Mets career In October 2009, Adam Rubin reported in his blog that Bernazard was close to joining the renowned sports agency Boras Corp., led by baseball super agent Scott Boras. Bernazard later denied this in an interview with FOX Sports' Ken Rosenthal. In the interview (dated April 27, 2010), Bernazard claimed that the media reports about his behavior were untrue. He also claimed that the Mets organization did not support him because the team needed a scapegoat for the 2009 season. As far as his career was concerned, Bernazard was not employed by a baseball team at that time, despite the fact that Bernazard claims he \\"had some calls\\" from unspecified sources at the end of December 2009. He additionally claimed that he \\"[hasn't] been looking for a job.\\" See also * List of Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico References External links Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Fukuoka Daiei Hawks players Category:Kinston Expos players Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico Category:Montreal Expos players Category:Nankai Hawks players Category:Nippon Professional Baseball second basemen Category:Nippon Professional Baseball third basemen Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:People from Caguas, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Puerto Rican expatriate baseball players in Japan Category:Quebec Metros players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:West Palm Beach Expos players ","title":"Tony Bernazard"},{"id":"2194138","text":"The Elliott Wave Theorist is a monthly newsletter published by Elliott Wave International.

It is a sequel to the 2003 video game Formula One 2003 and was based on the 2004 Formula One World Championship. Gameplay The game features all ten teams and twenty drivers competing in the 2004 Formula One World Championship (except for mid-season changes), as well as the eighteen circuits and Grands Prix that formed the championship, including the new Bahrain International Circuit and Shanghai International Circuit. It is the first Formula One game developed by SCE Studio Liverpool to contain a 'Career Mode', which allowed players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of a fixed number of seasons (albeit a repeat version of the 2004 Formula One World Championship each time). Players would start out testing in a generic Formula One car, and if they did well enough in the test they would be offered a contract by a small team such as Minardi. Players would then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. This game also had Net Play available. This is the only F1 game in the series to be changed in terms of gameplay after the original release. In the original version, there was a bug which during the timing of AI pitstops all the field crawled at pit lane speed, then they sped up once a few of the AI cars had made their stop, and it was very common to be following a car which suddenly came to a halt and the player would end up hitting their rear and ending their race. Studio Liverpool responded to the fans' concerns about this issue and fixed this bug upon the release of the Platinum version. Formula One 04 was released in Europe (PAL) and Japan (NTSC). The game features all the drivers and tracks from the 2004 Formula One World Championship, but does not represent the replacement drivers that featured in the real 2004 Formula One World Championship, therefore Timo Glock, Marc Gené, Antônio Pizzonia, Jacques Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta are not featured. Development Formula One 04 was announced on 21 April 2004 by Sony Computer Entertainment, and was the second game in the exclusive deal between Sony Computer Entertainment and Formula One Administration, following Formula One 2003. The game was officially launched in London ahead of the 2004 British Grand Prix with model Emma B acting as the face of the game.

Reception Formula One 04 received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Steve Boxer of The Guardian praised the graphics, the car handling, and the inclusion of all eighteen tracks but criticised the difficulty of the career mode and the lack of help in the car setup, stating \\"it is impossible to do anything other than tool around at the back of the field without tinkering with your car's setup - which is boring and hopelessly hit-or-miss without a virtual mechanic to assist you.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 30 out of 40.

Jind town is the administrative headquarters of the district. It is part of Hisar Division and was created in 1966. During the Sikh Empire, Jind lies in the heart of Haryana and is the fourth district of the Jat belt along with Sonipat, Rohtak and Hissar. Origin of name The district derives its name from its headquarters town Jind that is said to be derived from Jaintapuri. It is also said that this town had been founded at the time of the Mahabharata. According to a legend, the Pandavas built a temple in honour of Jainti Devi (the goddess of victory), offered prayers for success, and then launched the battle with the Kauravas. The town grew up around the temple and was named Jaintapuri (Abode of Jainti Devi) which later on came to be known as Jind. History =Jind Fort= Raja Gajpat Singh, a great-grandson of Phul, the founder of the Phulkian Misl, established an independent kingdom by seizing a large tract of the country, which included the territory occupied by the present district of Jind, from the Afghan governor Zain Khan in 1763 and created Jind city, the capital of the state in 1776. He built a fort here in 1775. Later, Sangrur was chosen as the capital of Jind State by Raja Sangat Singh (reigned 1822 to 1834). The Raja of Jind is of the same family as the Maharaja of Patiala, being like him, descended from Mr. Phul. The Originator of the Phulkian Dynasty, Phul left six sons, of whom Tiloka was the eldest, and from him are descended the families of Jind and Nabha. From Rama, the second son, sprang the greatest of the Phulkian houses, that of Patiala besides Bhadaur, Kot Duna and Malaudh. In 1627 Phul founded and gave his name to a village which was an important town in the State of Nabha. His two elder sons founded Bhai Rupa while Rama also built Rampura Phul. Punjab history reveals that Jind was founded by descendants of Mr.Phool. Jind was a native state in Haryana. Jind was a state of Siddus founded by the grandson of Chaudhary Phul Singh. Claiming descent from Jaisal, founder of the State of Jaisalmer in 1156, the founder of this Sikh dynasty, Phul, was Chaudhary (Governor) of a country located at the southeast of Dihli. Phul's descendants founded 3 States: Patiala, Jind, and Nabha. Tiloka had two sons namely, 1. Gurudutta 2. Sukh Chain. Sukh Chain's descendants ruled Jind state and Gurudatta's descendants ruled Nabha state. =Post-Independence after 1947= After independence, Jind State was merged with the Indian union and the territory of the present district became part of Sangrur district of Patiala and East Punjab States Union on 15 July 1948. At the time of its creation of Haryana state on 1 November 1966, Sangrur district was bifurcated and its Jind and Narwana tehsils were merged to form Jind district, one of the seven districts of the newly formed state. Jind tehsil was bifurcated to two tehsils: Jind and Safidon in 1966. Divisions The district comprises three sub-divisions: Jind, Narwana and Safidon. Jind sub-division is further divided into three tehsils: Jind, Julana and Alewa (sub-tehsil). Narwana sub-division is further divided into two tehsils: Narwana and Uchana (sub-tehsil), and Safidon sub-division is also divided into two tehsils: Safidon and Pillu-Khera (sub-tehsil). There are five Vidhan Sabha constituencies in this district: Jind, Julana, Safidon, Uchana Kalan and Narwana. Jind, Julana and Safidon are part of Sonipat Lok Sabha constituency. Narwana and Uchana Kalan are part of Sirsa and Hisar Lok Sabha constituencies respectively. Jind town, the administrative headquarters, has an Arjun stadium, milk plant, cattle feed plant, and a large grain market. There are facilities for stay at PWD rest house, canal rest house, and market committee rest house. The town is well provided with schools, colleges, hospitals, and other basic amenities. Jind is noted for its numerous temples sacred to the worship of Shiva. Tradition assigns the settlement of the town to the Mahabharat period. Rani Talab is the major tourist attraction and Pandu-Pidara and Ramrai are the main devotional places attracting devotees for Amaavas bath. Demographics According to the 2011 census Jind district has a population of 1,334,152, roughly equal to the nation of Mauritius or the US state of Maine. This gives it a ranking of 364th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 11.95%. Jind has a sex ratio of 870 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 72.7%.

The series ran from October 31, 1983 to July 27, 1984 on NBC. Gene Rayburn reprised his role as host of the Match Game and Super Match segments, while Jon \\"Bowzer\\" Bauman hosted the Hollywood Squares segment. Gene Wood was the show's regular announcer with Johnny Olson, Rich Jeffries, and Bob Hilton substituting during the run. The series was credited as a Mark Goodson Television Production. Orion Television, then-owners of the Hollywood Squares format rights, licensed the format to Goodson. Rules =Match Game= For the Match Game portion of the show, two new contestants played a 1970s-style competition with a six-person panel consisting of Bauman and five other celebrities. The game-play format was the one used on the syndicated Match Game PM; Rayburn read a humorous fill-in-the- blank question, and each celebrity wrote down a response. Once all the responses were in, the contestant answered verbally and scored one point for each celebrity he/she matched. Three rounds were played, with each contestant having one turn per round and matched celebrities not playing subsequent questions. A random draw was used to determine which contestant started the first round, and the leader at the end of each round started the next one. If either of the first two rounds ended in a tie, the contestant who did not start the previous round played first in the next one. The contestant with the higher final score advanced to play Hollywood Squares, while the loser was eliminated. In case of a tie, a modified version of the Match Game PM tiebreaker was used, with Rayburn reading a short item (example: \\"_____, New Jersey\\"). The difference was that instead of writing their answers on a card, the contestants were secretly shown four numbered options (examples: \\"Atlantic City\\", \\"Hoboken\\", \\"Newark\\", \\"Trenton\\"). Each contestant chose one option by number, with the first choice determined by random draw, after which Rayburn read the question to the panel and polled them, one at a time. The first contestant whose chosen answer matched any panel member won the game. =Hollywood Squares= The Hollywood Squares half of the show pitted the Match Game winner against the previous day's champion. For Squares, three more celebrities joined the panel along with Rayburn, who took Bauman's seat at bottom left. A third tier of the panel set swung into place to accommodate the new panelists, and the celebrity who was already sitting in the top center seat for Match Game became the center square. As on the original Squares, contestants took turns attempting to claim squares on a tic-tac-toe board. The contestant in control chose a celebrity, who answered a question from Bauman. If the contestant correctly agreed or disagreed with the answer, he/she claimed that celebrity's square; a miss awarded it to the opponent. The first contestant to get three of his/her own symbol in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or capture five squares won the game. There were several differences in game play compared to the original Squares. Here, the champion always played \\"X\\" and the opponent \\"O\\", regardless of the gender of the contestants. This has been the only version of Squares not to use the traditional \\"Mr. X\\" or \\"M(r)s. Circle\\" distinction. Each individual square earned was worth $25; the first game was worth $100, and the value increased by $100 for each subsequent game. No \\"Secret Square\\" was played in this version. Most questions asked were of the true/false or multiple choice variety. The most significant rule change involved winning a game. On all versions of Squares before and since, if a contestant missed a question on a square that the opponent needed for a win, control would simply pass back to the opponent and they would have to earn the square on their own. This version of Squares eliminated that rule, enabling a contestant to win a game on an opponent's error. The contestants played as many games as time allowed, with the champion starting the first game and the loser of each game starting the next one. When the final bell rang, the contestant in the lead became the day's champion and joined Rayburn on stage to play the Super Match bonus round. Both contestants kept any money they earned in this segment. In the event of a tie, the board was cleared and the contestant who did not play last chose one star. If the contestant correctly agreed/disagreed with that star's answer to Bauman's question, he/she won an additional $25 and the match; if not, the opponent won. =Super Match= The champion played for a grand prize of up to $30,000 in the Super Match, whose rules were nearly identical to the 1973–82 version of Match Game, but with Bauman and all eight of the other celebrities as panelists. The round began with the Audience Match, in which the champion tried to match one of the three most popular responses given by a previous studio audience to a short phrase such as \\"Trading ______ .\\" The champion was allowed to call on any three celebrities for help, and could either use one of their responses or offer one of his/her own. The three most popular responses awarded $1,000, $500, and $250 in descending order. If the champion failed to match any of these responses, the round did not end as on previous versions of Match Game; rather, he/she was given $100. Next, in the Head-to-Head Match, the champion attempted to match against one celebrity of his/her choice; the Star Wheel was not used. Each celebrity held a secret multiplier number (four 10's, four 20's, one 30), which was hidden behind a card at his/her seat. The chosen celebrity revealed his/her number, and Rayburn read another short phrase for which he/she wrote down a response. The champion then stated an answer verbally; if it was an exact match to the written response, he/she won an additional cash prize equal to the Audience Match value multiplied by the celebrity's number. A champion could win up to $31,000 in a single Super Match, by scoring $1,000 in the Audience Match, choosing the celebrity with the 30, and making a successful Head-to-Head Match to win another $30,000. Regardless of the end result of the Super Match, the champion would return on the next episode to play Hollywood Squares against that day's Match Game winner. Champions remained on the show until they either lost to a challenger or played the Super Match five times. If a champion retired, a contestant was chosen at random to fill the \\"X\\" position on the next day's Squares segment. Broadcast history The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour debuted on October 31, 1983 at 3:00 PM in the Eastern time zone (2:00 PM in the Central and Pacific time zones and 1:00 PM in the Mountain time zone) on NBC. Both Match Game and Hollywood Squares had been aired on NBC, with (The) Match Game (albeit with different rules) airing from 1962 to 1969 and (The) Hollywood Squares airing from 1966 to 1980. The show's only regular panelists were the co-hosts; Bauman sat on the panel during Match Game and the Super Match, while Rayburn took his place during Hollywood Squares. The most frequent semi-regular panelist was actress Nedra Volz, who appeared for nine weeks, followed closely by Mr. Smith star Leonard Frey and returning Match Game regular Charles Nelson Reilly, who each appeared for seven weeks. Several of the panelists were previously regulars or semi-regulars on Match Game, including Fannie Flagg (who appeared four weeks), McLean Stevenson, Marcia Wallace, Fred Travalena and Bill Daily; Bauman himself, as Bowzer, had also previously appeared on Match Game. George Gobel, who appeared one week, and Abby Dalton, who appeared two weeks, were the only Hollywood Squares regulars to ever appear on the program. Following the practice of both parent shows, the same group of eight celebrity guests appeared on an entire week of episodes. Five were introduced at the start of the episode to play Match Game; at the end of that segment, the remaining three emerged onstage for Hollywood Squares. Aside from Rayburn and Bauman, the panelists rotated so that different groups of three played only Squares from one day to the next. Cast members of other NBC series often appeared on the show. It was also a starting point for new, unknown, and up-and-coming stars who would go on to greater fame, such as Jay Leno and Arsenio Hall (both of which would become successes as late-night talk show hosts). Game show hosts also appeared on the show, including Bill Cullen, Bob Eubanks, Pat Sajak, Bill Rafferty, and Chuck Woolery (who promoted Scrabble during the week before it premiered). The cast of Leave It to Beaver was reunited for one week at the end of 1983, while a week in May 1984 featured NBC soap opera stars. Other special weeks in 1984 featured the casts of Too Close for Comfort and St. Elsewhere, as well as a salute to the 1950s with movie/television stars from that decade. The series went up against the highly-rated soap operas General Hospital and Guiding Light in its time slot. Near the end of its run, NBC announced plans to begin production of the Dobson Productions-created soap opera Santa Barbara, which would result in the show's cancellation. The final episode of the series aired on July 27, 1984. =Aftermath= Original Squares host Peter Marshall, in his autobiography, states that he expected to be asked to host the Hollywood Squares portion once he heard that they had secured Rayburn's participation, but he was never approached. He also admitted having some schadenfreude at the show's cancellation, saying: \\"I kind of hate to admit that I was happy when it didn't even last one season.\\" This version was the last time to date that Hollywood Squares aired on a broadcast network; in 1986, a syndicated revival aired for three years with John Davidson as host. A further revival, hosted by Tom Bergeron, aired in syndication from 1998 to 2004. A hip hop-themed series based on the format, Hip Hop Squares, aired on MTV2 in 2012, and was revived for VH1 in 2017. A fourth spinoff, this one pertaining to country music, Nashville Squares, debuted on CMT in 2019. This was in addition to several parodies and one-offs of varying degrees of official endorsement; Howard Stern's version, Homeless Howiewood Squares, for example, included Rayburn reprising his role as a regular panelist. Match Game did not return to the airwaves until a revival on ABC in 1990, with Ross Shafer as host. Match Game was again revived in 1998, hosted by Michael Burger. Each lasted one season. Match Game was used as one of the semifinal games in CBS' Summer 2006 airing of Game $how Marathon hosted by Ricki Lake; a version of the show produced in Canada aired for two seasons beginning in 2012, and a prime time version on ABC debuted in 2016 with Alec Baldwin as host. Rayburn went on to host two more game shows: Break the Bank (from which he was fired after 13 weeks) and the short-lived game The Movie Masters for AMC from 1989 to 1990. Bauman, whose only other hosting credit was the concurrent The Pop 'N Rocker Game, has not hosted another game show since. =Resurface= Prior to 2019, the program had never been re-broadcast due to cross-ownership issues between MGM (Orion’s successor and copyright owner for Hollywood Squares episodes produced until 1989), Fremantle (Goodson/Todman’s successor), CBS Television Distribution (successor to King World Productions and current rightsholder to the show's format since 1991 and episodes produced since 1998) and the distribution agents originally responsible for the original NBC run until Fremantle's digital multicast network, Buzzr, aired four episodes (the Tuesday-Friday shows of premiere week) on February 17, 2019. Buzzr also mentioned that they will be working on digitizing and cleaning up the original master tapes in order to get the show on their regular schedule later in the year. Fremantle noted that the addition was being done for two reasons: to increase the number of Match Game episodes available for the network to rerun, and to add some form of Hollywood Squares (which the network does not own) onto the channel's lineup. Former host Bauman wrote on Twitter, \\"Understand that this was the only completely honest version of Hwd Squares ever where no Squares were sitting there with the punch lines of the jokes in front of them.\\" On September 12, 2019, it was reported that Buzzr's new primetime lineup would feature the show, starting September 30. Music The theme of The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour was composed by Edd Kalehoff. The theme and the music played during the show's ticket plug are used as car and showcase cues on The Price Is Right, as well as the 1986–89 version of Card Sharks. A revamp of the theme, \\"Lottery\\", was used by WNEV-TV/WHDH-TV in Boston during the late 1980s and early 1990s as well as several local Illinois game shows; it can also be heard at the stage show The Price Is Right Live! The theme was also used as a cue on the British version of The Price Is Right (more specifically The New Price Is Right) hosted by Bob Warman, which briefly aired on Sky from 1989 until 1990.

It is a sequel to the 2004 video game Formula One 04 and was based on the 2005 Formula One World Championship. Gameplay It featured the 'Career Mode' concept from Formula One 04, which allows players to work their way through the Formula One teams over the course of five years (albeit a repeat version of the 2005 Formula One World Championship each time). This game also supports EyeToy: Cameo, allowing players to place their own face on a driver when creating their profile, but unlike F1 04, though they cannot choose their own helmet at the start, the player assumes a white unmarked helmet and only later unlocks other colours and designs. Players start out testing for smaller teams (Minardi, Jordan and Red Bull Racing (Like in F1 04, a generic car does exist, but it is only used in Time Attack mode)). Players then work their way up the grid throughout their 'career' through a mixture of good tests and impressive race performances. As before, consistently poor performances will lead to dismissal from the player's current team. There are also occasional 'shoot- out' tests against the team's second driver (or third driver, depending on the player's current status within the team), in which both drivers complete a set of five laps each and whoever has the fastest overall time (one time based on the fastest first, second and third sectors added together) then takes the race seat. Players can now also view trophies they have received from winning races and championships after each is won in Career Mode for the first time. As with F1 04, \\"classic\\" cars (like the Williams FW11) are unlocked once certain terms are fulfilled, such as winning a World Championship. Helmets for Career Mode are also unlocked, and there is also a hidden track (the Detroit street circuit which was used for Detroit Grand Prix and the Paul Ricard circuit in France()) available for Time Attack Mode. Notably, since this game was developed before the change in the qualifying regulations midway through the actual 2005 Formula One World Championship, this game runs the original \\"aggregated times\\" format from the early part of the actual 2005 Formula One World Championship in every race in Race Weekend, Championship and Career Mode. This game also has Net Play available. A notable credit is the opening video features the song \\"Butterflies & Hurricanes\\" from English alternative rock band Muse. The game features all the drivers and tracks from the 2005 Formula One World Championship, but does not represent the replacement drivers that featured in the real 2005 Formula One World Championship, therefore Vitantonio Liuzzi, Alexander Wurz, Ricardo Zonta, Anthony Davidson, Pedro de la Rosa, Robert Doornbos and Antônio Pizzonia are not featured. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four sevens for a total of 28 out of 40. For the first time in a number of years, the fans agreed that this was a massive improvement in the series and the shot in the arm it had so desperately needed. A lot of people had criticised Studio Liverpool for the lack of ambition and progress since the series appeared on the PS2 platform up to that point. With the release of Formula One 05, people saw that great strides had been made by Studio Liverpool in terms of gameplay handling and AI. However, there were criticisms in terms of the AI being too easy on the most difficult of settings, and about the penalty system that had been introduced on Formula One 05 which automatically reduced the revs during a penalty instead of the traditional \\"drive-through\\" penalties that previous games had seen. Overall though, the fans agreed that apart from these minor issues, Studio Liverpool had redeveloped the brand as a stepping stone for improvement for the inevitable release of the 2006 edition.

Based on the fictional superhero team the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it is the sequel to the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze (1991) and is the final installment of the original trilogy. It was produced by Clearwater Holdings Ltd. and Golden Harvest. With the voices of Brian Tochi, Corey Feldman, Tim Kelleher, Robbie Rist, and James Murray. It was the last Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film released by New Line Cinema and released on VHS along with Columbia TriStar Home Video. Like the previous film, it was internationally distributed by 20th Century Fox. The creature effects were provided by the All Effects Company, rather than Jim Henson's Creature Shop, which acted as the providers for the previous films. Despite being a moderate box office success, it is the lowest rated entry in the series. It received negative reviews from critics. Plot In 1603, in feudal Japan, a young man is being chased by four samurai on horseback. As they go into the woods, a mysterious woman emerges from the underbrush and watches closely. However, the samurai eventually capture and take the youth, revealed to be a prince named Kenshin, with them. In the present, two years after the events of the previous film with the defeat of The Shredder and The Foot Clan, April O'Neil has been shopping at the flea market in preparation for her upcoming vacation. She brings her friends the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles gifts to cheer them up. Michelangelo is given an old lamp (the lampshade of which he wears as an impression of Elvis Presley in \\"Blue Hawaii\\"), Donatello is given a broken radio to fix, Leonardo is given a book on swords, and Raphael is to receive a fedora but, having stormed off earlier, he is never formally given it. For Splinter, she brings an ancient Japanese scepter. Back in the past, Kenshin is being scolded by his father, Lord Norinaga, for disgracing their family name, but Kenshin argues that his father's desire for war is the true disgrace. Their argument is interrupted by Walker, an English trader who has come to supply Norinaga with added manpower and firearms, and Kenshin leaves his father's presence to brood alone in a temple. There, he finds the same scepter and reads the inscription: \\"Open Wide the Gates of Time\\". In the present, April is looking at the scepter and it begins to light up. She is then sent back in time, while Kenshin takes her place; each wears what the other did. Upon arrival, April is accused of being a witch, but Walker deduces she has no power and has April put in prison to suffer. Back in the present, Kenshin is highly distressed upon seeing the turtles and calls them \\"kappa\\". After learning from Kenshin of the situation, the turtles decide to go back in time to get April. However, according to Donatello's calculations, they have to do it within 60 hours, otherwise the scepter's power will disappear due to the space-time continuum being out of sync. They bring in Casey Jones to watch over the lair and use the scepter to warp through time. When doing so, the turtles are replaced by four of Norinaga's Honor Guards and are confused at their new surroundings. Back in time, the turtles awake on horseback and make a poor show of riding their steeds. During the confusion, Mikey (who is carrying the scepter) ends up riding off alone into the forest and gets ambushed by an unknown assailant. The others go to search for April at Norinaga's castle, where their identity as Honor Guards allows them cover in their search. After following Niles, one of Walker's thugs into the prison, the turtles rescue April and also free another prisoner named Whit (locked up for trying to start a mutiny against Walker, and who bears a striking resemblance to Casey), but their sloppy escape ends up leaving them all alone in the wilderness and without a clue where to go. Meanwhile, in the present, Kenshin is getting impatient and anticipates a fight from Casey. Casey instead introduces him and the Honor Guards to television hockey, which manages to calm them down for the time being. Out in the woods, the turtles, April, and Whit are again attacked, this time by villagers mistaking them for Norinaga's forces. The attack stops when Mitsu, leader of the rebellion against Lord Norinaga, unmasks Raphael and sees that he looks just like one of her prisoners. The turtles realize that she is talking about Mikey and accompany Mitsu to her village. When they arrive, the village is being burned down by Walker's men. As the turtles help the villagers save it, Mikey is let out by a pair of clueless soldiers and joins in the fight. Walker is forced to retreat, but the fire continues to burn and has trapped a young boy named Yoshi inside a house. Michelangelo saves Yoshi from the fire, then Leonardo helps him recover by performing CPR. As Walker continues bargaining with Lord Norinaga over buying guns in exchange for gold, the turtles spend some time in the village. Donatello decides to have a replica scepter made so they can get back home, while Michelangelo teaches some of the people about pizza and later tries to console Mitsu about Kenshin, whom she is in love with. Raphael also gets in touch with his sensitive side through the child Yoshi, and teaches Yoshi how to control his temper. Back in the present, the Honor Guards from the past are quickly adjusting to life in the 20th Century, and Casey decides to challenge them to a hockey game. To Casey's dismay, the Honor Guards think hockey is about beating up each other. Meanwhile, Kenshin and Splinter fear that the ninja turtles will not return home in time before their sixty hours are up. In the past, the replica scepter is completed, but an argument between Michelangelo and Raphael ends up breaking it. To make matters worse, Mitsu informs them that Lord Norinaga has agreed to purchase Walker's guns and will attack the village in the morning. However, when Raphael sneaks off to visit Yoshi, he is surprised to find the original scepter in the child's possession. The turtles are overjoyed to see it but are angry at Mitsu for hiding it and essentially forcing them to fight her war. However, Mitsu's grandfather clarifies that it was his idea to have the turtles fight in her place. Suddenly, Whit betrays everybody, captures Mitsu and takes the scepter with him, and the turtles return to Norinaga's palace to save her. After rescuing her, they are cornered by Norinaga and are made to fight waves of his soldiers. The turtles respond by freeing the prisoners in the palace, starting an all-out war on the palace grounds. After a while of fighting, Leo defeats Lord Norinaga in a heated sword duel, comedically finishing him by cutting his hair and then trapping him inside of a bell. Deciding to cut his losses, Walker takes the scepter and tries to escape to his boat. When cornered by the turtles at the dock, Walker throws the scepter into the air as a distraction. The turtles catch the scepter, while Whit (who reformed after Walker went back on a deal they had made) launches a fireball from a catapult at Walker and knocks him off the dock to his death. The turtles are now ready to return to their own time, but Mikey says he would rather stay with Mitsu. Raphael decides he wants to stay as well because he feels like the Turtles are appreciated in Japan unlike back home. The other turtles and April try to convince them otherwise until Kenshin activates the scepter and makes the decision harder. After a long debate (which included Mitsu telling Mikey to keep his promise about Kenshin returning to the past), Michelangelo reluctantly agrees to go home with his brothers, but just barely misses grabbing the scepter in time. The Honor Guards switch back with the Turtles (all except for Michelangelo). Fortunately, the last remaining Honor Guard Benkei activates the scepter and swaps places with Mikey just before the scepter burns out. In the past, Norinaga admits surrender to Mitsu and Kenshin (who hand the scepter to him), and the two lovers share a tender reunion. Meanwhile, Michaelangelo is depressed over the thought of growing up, but Splinter cheers him up by performing the \\"lampshade Elvis\\" impression, and the rest of the turtles join in with a final dance number. Cast =Live actors= * Paige Turco as April * Elias Koteas as Casey / Whit * Stuart Wilson as Walker * John Aylward as Niles * Sab Shimono as Lord Norinaga * Vivian Wu as Mitsu * Henry Hayashi as Kenshin * Jordi Webber as Yoshi =Voice cast= * Brian Tochi as Leonardo * Corey Feldman as Donatello * Tim Kelleher as Raphael * Robbie Rist as Michelangelo * James Murray as Splinter Rist and Tochi (who did the voices of Michelangelo and Leonardo, respectively) are the only 2 voice actors to voice the same character throughout all 3 live-action TMNT movies. Corey Feldman returned as the voice of Donatello, after being absent for the second movie. =Puppeteers= * Jim Martin as Leo (face performance) ** Mark Caso as Leonardo (in-suit performer) * Rob Mills as Donatello (facial assistant) ** Jim Raposa as Donatello (in-suit performer) * Noel MacNeal as Raphael (face performance) ** Matt Hill as Raphael (in-suit performer) * Gord Robertson as Michelangelo (face performance) ** David Fraser as Michelangelo (in-suit performer) * James Murray as Splinter (principal puppetry) ** Lisa Sturz as Splinter (assisted puppetry) ** Tim Lawrence as Splinter (assisted puppetry) Reception =Box office= Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III debuted at number 1 at the U.S. box office with a gross of $12.4 million from 2,087 screens. The film grossed $42.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $12.2 internationally, giving a worldwide gross of $54.5 million. Although it made twice its production budget, returns were barely more than half that of the previous film and roughly one-quarter that of the first; thus, it was considered a disappointment. =Critical response= Reviews for the film have been largely negative by critics. Based on a sample of 30 reviews, the film holds a 23% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus: \\"It's a case of one sequel too many for the heroes in a half shell, with a tired time-travel plot gimmick failing to save the franchise from rapidly diminishing returns\\". On Metacritic it has a score of 40 out of 100, based on reviews from 12 critics.https://www.metacritic.com/movie/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii Michael Wilmington of Los Angeles Times noted that distributors deliberately kept the film away from critics. Despite mild praise for the look of the film, Wilmington called the first film a fluke hit and called this third film \\"sequel hell\\". James Berardinelli gave it one out of four stars, citing that \\"any adults accompanying their kids will have to invent new and interesting ways to stay awake. Not only is this movie aimed at young children, the script could have been written by them\\". TV Guide gave it two out of four stars and said in their review: \\"If the time-travel gimmick has to be employed twice in a row then it's probably best to banish these characters to a retirement sewer\\", when commenting about a possible future film invoking time travel. Home media As with both of the previous films, the British PG version was censored due to usage of forbidden weapons (Michelangelo's nunchaku). For these scenes, alternate material was used. The cuts were waived for the DVD release. The German theatrical and video version was based on the censored UK cut; the DVD is uncut. The film was released to VHS and Laserdisc in 1993. The film has been released on DVD, and also two Blu-ray box sets with both of its predecessors. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles- Collection/dp/B00DVNXW9O Cancelled sequel Following the disappointing box office, early plans for a fourth instalment were cancelled. A script entitled \\"TMNT IV: The Foot Walks Again\\" was written by Craig Shapiro and John Travis. Peter Laird has released concept designs for a version which he says would have been titled \\"TMNT: The Next Mutation\\". Playmates catalogues indicated a fourth film would be released in 1996 but it never materialised. There would not be another film until the 2007 animated film and there would not be another live-action adaptation until the 2014 reboot.

The road begins in western Nashville (junction of Memphis-Bristol Highway and Charlotte Pike) and ends in Crossville (junction of West Avenue & Sparta Highway). It runs alongside Interstate 40 for its entire length. There are no \\"Tennessee 24\\" signs along the route, although the designation can be seen on the route's mile markers.

He served as Judge of the High Court of Admiralty from 1798 to 1828. Background and education Scott was born at Heworth, a village about four miles from Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of a tradesman engaged in the transport of coal. His younger brother John Scott became Lord Chancellor and was made Earl of Eldon. He was educated at Newcastle Royal Grammar School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he gained a Durham scholarship in 1761. In 1764 he graduated and became first a probationary fellow and then as successor to William (afterwards the well known Sir William) Jones a tutor of University College. As Camden reader of ancient history he rivalled the reputation of Blackstone. Although he had joined the Middle Temple in 1762, it was not till 1776 that Scott devoted himself to a systematic study of law. Legal, political and judicial career Scott graduated as doctor of civil law, and, after a customary year of silence, commenced practice in the ecclesiastical courts. His professional success was rapid. In 1783 he became registrar of the court of faculties, and in 1788 judge of the consistory court and advocate-general, in that year too receiving the honour of knighthood; and in 1798 he was made judge of the high court of admiralty. In this capacity he heard on appeal two important cases having to do with the abolition of the slave trade. On 22 May 1809 took Donna Marianna on the Cape Coast for breach of the Act for the abolition of the slave trade. The Vice admiralty court at Sierra Leone condemned the vessel. Although Donna Marianna was ostensibly a Portuguese vessel, Scott upheld the seizure on the grounds that she was actually a British vessel and her Portuguese papers were a fraud.African Institution (1812), Vol. 6-9, pp.167-170. The second case involved the French ship Le Lois after it had been seized by the West Africa Squadron for slave trading off the African coast at Cape Mesurado. HMS Queen Charlotte had originally vindicated the seizure and confiscation of the ship and cargo. However Scott overturned this judgement, saying that the way Le Lois had been stopped and boarded was illegal as \\"No nation can exercise a right of visitation and search on the common and unappropriated parts of the sea, save only on the belligerent claim.\\" He accepted that this would constitute a serious impediment to the suppression of the slave trade, but argued that this should be remedied through international treaties rather than Naval officers exceeding what they were permitted to do. He twice contested Oxford University in 1780 without success, but successfully in 1801. He also sat for Downton in 1790. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1793. Upon the coronation of George IV in 1821 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Stowell, of Stowell Park in the County of Gloucester, taking his title from the name of his estate. After a life of judicial service Lord Stowell retired from the bench - from the consistory court in August 1821, and from the high court of admiralty in December 1827. Personal life Lord Stowell married twice. His first marriage, in 1781, was to Anna Maria, eldest daughter and heiress of John Bagnall of Erleigh Court, near Reading, in Berkshire, where the two later resided. They had four children, one of whom, a daughter, survived him. He married again, in 1813, the dowager Marchioness of Sligo, née Louisa Catharine Howe, younger daughter of the first and last Earl Howe of the 1788 creation, widow of John Browne, 1st Marquess of Sligo. He died on 28 January 1836 at Erleigh Court, aged 90, and the barony became extinct.

Biography Ang learned to swim at the age of five , taught by his father, Ang Teck Bee (Chinese: 洪德美). The senior Ang was an athlete of note who competed in judo at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. He studied at Anderson Secondary School and Anglo-Chinese School. Ang first represented Singapore at the 1977 Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur, where he won a silver medal in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay. His first major international competition was the Hawaii International Invitational Swimming Championship, an event which included many top swimmers from countries that boycotted the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow. During the meet, Ang delighted the swimming fraternity by being the only non- American swimmer to qualify for the 50m freestyle final. As a result of his performance in Hawaii, Ang received a full athletic scholarship from the University of Houston in the United States. =World's fastest Swimmer= In 1982, at the US Swimming Championships, Ang won the 50 m freestyle in 22.69 seconds, acknowledged by the swim fraternity as record time for that year. Ang represented Singapore at the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi, and won gold in the 100 m freestyle. He was presented with the 'World's Fastest Swimmer' award for 1982. In 1983, Ang won the 50-yard freestyle race at the NCAA Division One Swimming Championships. He was the 50-yard champion at the US Swimming Championships in 1982 and 1986, and was named an All-American for four consecutive years from 1981 to 1984. =1984 Olympics and after= Ang represented Singapore at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where he won the 'B' consolation final in the 100 m freestyle.

He held the Asian record in the 50 metres freestyle up until 1996. His time of 22.69 seconds stood as a Singapore national record for 33 years until Joseph Schooling broke it at the 2015 SEA Games. =Coaching= Since retiring from top-level competition, Ang has devoted himself to coaching. He has worked with swimmers at all levels – from young children just learning how to swim, to national champions preparing to represent Singapore at top international competitions. He founded the APS Swim School in Singapore. At the 2000 World Masters Swimming Championships, Ang won the 35–39 age group 50m freestyle event.

Born in Kati in Mali's Koulikoro Region, Seydou lived part of his childhood in Ouagadougou (now the capital of Burkina Faso) before moving back to Kati with his mother in 1963. Even in childhood, he designed and created clothing to dress dolls and, in 1965, he became an apprentice of the tailor Cheickene Camara at Kati. In 1967, he returned to Ouagadougou where he opened his first tailorshop. He soon moved to Abidjan (1969) and then to Paris (1971), where he worked first for Yves Saint-Laurent and then at Mic Mac with the stylist Tan Guidicelli. At this time he also met designer Paco Rabanne. Leaving in 1981, Seydou moved again to Abidjan, where he created his Chris Seydou line. For the new line, Seydou designed Western- style jackets and miniskirts from traditional African patterns and fabrics, marketing the clothes in the United States, Europe, and urban West Africa. The designs are particularly noted for their pioneering use of bògòlanfini, traditional mud-dyed cloth. Seydou returned to Mali in 1990, becoming good friends with soon-to-be-president Alpha Oumar Konaré. In 1993, he founded the African Foundation of Fashion Designers, but died in 1994 following a brief illness.

Interpreted variously over the centuries, the metaphor is now used to speak of one who spitefully prevents others from having something for which one has no use. Although the story was ascribed to Aesop's Fables in the 15th century, there is no ancient source that does so. Greek origin The short form of the fable as cited by Laura Gibbs is: \\"There was a dog lying in a manger who did not eat the grain, but who nevertheless prevented the horse from being able to eat anything either.\\" The story was first glossed in the 1st century CE lexicon of Diogenianus as \\"The dog in the manger, concerning those who neither themselves use nor allow others to use: Insofar as the dog neither itself eats the barleycorns, nor allows the horse to\\".Cited in Wolfgang Mieder, Behold the Proverbs of a People, University of Mississippi 2014, Google Books It was twice used in the following century by Greek writer Lucian: in \\"Remarks addressed to an illiterate book-fancier\\" and in his play \\"Timon the Misanthrope\\".Loeb edition, p.342, available at archive.org One other contemporary poetic source is a paederastic epigram by Straton of Sardis in the Greek Anthology.Puerilities, translated by Daryl Hine, Princeton University, 2001, Epigram 236 At roughly the same time, an alternative version of the fable was alluded to in Saying 102 of the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas. This example involves oxen rather than a horse: \\"Jesus said, 'Woe to the Pharisees, for they are like a dog sleeping in the manger of oxen, for neither does he eat nor does he let the oxen eat'.\\" Assuming that this gospel is not an original document, the saying seems to be an adaptation of criticism of the Pharisees in the canonical Gospel of Matthew (23.13): \\"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces; you do not enter yourselves, nor will you let others enter.\\" Later use in Europe American children's illustration, 1880 The fable does not appear in any of the traditional collections of Aesop's Fables and is not attributed to him until Steinhöwel's Esopus (c. 1476). There it is titled \\"Of the envious dog\\" (de cane invido) and illustrates a moral proposition: \\"People frequently begrudge something to others that they themselves cannot enjoy. Even though it does them no good, they won't let others have it.\\" After the cattle that it hinders from eating remonstrate with it, Steinhöwel goes on to mention that \\"The same thing happened when a dog was holding a bone in his mouth: the dog couldn't chew on the bone that way, but no other dog was able to chew on it either.\\" There were, however, earlier 14th century poetic references to the fable. In John Gower's Confessio Amantis (c.1390) it is related: ::::Though it be not the hound's habit ::::To eat chaff, yet will he warn off ::::An ox that commeth to the barn ::::Thereof to take up any food. Though the next reference in English is in John Langland's The Pilgrimage of the Life of Man (1426), where it is applied to a personification of miserliness, the work was written almost a century before in French by Guillaume de Deguileville (1335). While a horse figures in some allusions by later writers, the ox is the preferred beast in Renaissance emblem books. It appears as such in a Latin poem by Hieronymus Osius (1564), although the accompanying illustration shows both an ox and an ass and the dog there, as in Steinhöwel, carries a bone clenched between its teeth.De cane in praesepio, poem 67 Oxen appear also in the Latin prose version of Arnold Freitag (1579)Mythologia Ethica pp.68–9 and in the English poem by Geoffrey Whitney (1586).Choice of Emblemes, page 184 Most of these authors follow Steinhöwel in interpreting the fable as an example of envy, but Christoph Murer's emblem of 1622 is titled meanness (Kargheit) and the accompanying verse explains that such behaviour is miserly, not using what one has for oneself nor for the relief of others in need.XL emblemata miscella nova, Emblem 22 Later on the dog's behaviour is reinterpreted as malicious, a reading made clear in Roger L'Estrange's pithy version: \\"A churlish envious Cur was gotten into a manger, and there lay growling and snarling to keep the Provender. The Dog eat none himself, and yet rather ventur'd the starving his own Carcase than he would suffer any Thing to be the better for't. THE MORAL. Envy pretends to no other Happiness than what it derives from the Misery of other People, and will rather eat nothing itself than not to starve those that would.\\" Samuel Croxall echoes L'Estrange's observation in Fables of Aesop and Others (1722). \\"The stronger the passion is, the greater torment he endures; and subjects himself to a continual real pain, by only wishing ill to others.\\" It is with this understanding that the idiom of \\"a dog in a manger\\" is most often used currently. However, a recent study has noted that it seems to be falling out of use, in America at least, concluding that \\"the majority of [respondents] do not know it or even recall ever having heard it\\".Wolfgang Mieder, \\"The dog in the manger\\": The rise and decline in popularity of a proverb and a fable. Midwestern Folklore: Journal of the Hoosier Folklore Society, 2011, 37.1: 1–44. An abstract of his study is available in FOAFTales Newsletter 78, April 2011, The article was later incorporated as a chapter in Mieder's Behold the Proverbs of a People, University of Mississippi 2014, Google Books Sexual interpretation One of Lucian's allusions to the fable gives it a metaphorically sexual slant: \\"You used to say that they acted absurdly in that they loved you to excess, yet did not dare to enjoy you when they might, and instead of giving free rein to their passion when it lay in their power to do so, they kept watch and ward, looking fixedly at the seal and the bolt; for they thought it enjoyment enough, not that they were able to enjoy you themselves, but that they were shutting out everyone else from a share in the enjoyment, like the dog in the manger that neither ate the barley herself nor permitted the hungry horse to eat it.\\" (Timon the Misanthrope) In the 1687 Francis Barlow edition of the fables, Aphra Behn similarly sums up the sexual politics of the idiom: \\"Thus aged lovers with young beautys live, Keepe off the joys they want the power to give.\\" It was of exactly such a situation involving a eunuch and his slaveboys that Straton had complained in the Greek anthology. But the idiom was also applied to occasions of heterosexual jealousy between equals, as for example in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights, where it arises during an argument between Catherine Linton and Isabella Linton over Isabella's love for Heathcliff.Wuthering Heights etext. Chapter 10, p.59 A Spanish story involving sexual jealousy and selfishness appears in Lope de Vega's play El Perro del Hortelano (The Gardener's Dog, in 1618). In this case, De Vega's title alludes to the parallel European idiom involving a variant story in which a gardener sets his dog to guard his cabbages (or lettuces). After the gardener's death the dog continues to forbid people access to the beds, giving rise to the simile \\"He's like the gardener's dog that eats no cabbage and won't let others either\\" or, for short, \\"playing the gardener's dog\\" (faire le chien du jardinier).Emanuel Strauss: Concise Dictionary of European Proverbs, London, 1998, proverb 1036 In the Martinique Creole there is also the similar-sounding proverb, \\"The dog doesn’t like the banana and he doesn’t want the hen to eat it.\\"Funk, Henry Elwell. 1953. The French Creole Dialect of Martinique: Its Historical Background, Vocabulary, Syntax, Proverbs and Literature, with a Glossary. University of Virginia: PhD dissertation, p.90 Artistic use 1899 theatre poster for the farce by Charles H. Hoyt Popular artistic allusions to the fable, or the idiom arising from it, were especially common during the 19th century. Where Lope de Vega had adapted the theme to a problem play in the 17th century, the Belgian composer Albert Grisar used it as the basis for his one-act comic opera of 1855, Le chien du jardinier.The score is archived online The idiom was also taken up in the US by the successful writer of farces, Charles H. Hoyt, where a horse rather than the more common ox figured on the 1899 poster (see left). The title has also been used in various media since then, but without reference to the fable in publicity or on covers. Several well-known artists had illustrated fable collections and their designs were recycled for various purposes. Among these may be mentioned Wenceslaus Hollar's print for the 1666 Ogilby edition of Aesop's fables, in which a dog occupies the manger and barks at a single ox being driven into a wooden barn. Shortly afterwards, Francis Barlow pictured the dog snarling on a pile of hay in a brick-built barn, while the dog does so in a more open farmyard structure in Samuel Howitt's A New Work of Animals (1810). Hollar's design of the ox turning its head to look round at the dog with the barn's brick entrance behind was clearly an influence on later illustrators, including those for the various editions of Samuel Croxall's fable collection and for Thomas Bewick's of 1818. Such illustrations were influential too on those who created designs for crockery. That on a Spode serving dish from 1831 is also related to the Barlow design, although the action takes place outside the barn. A Staffordshire nursery dish of 1835, however, has more in common with Howitt's design. The fable also figured on the popular alphabet plates from Brownhills Pottery later in the 19th century, although in this case only the ox's head is featured as it gazes at the dog reared up and barking. In Britain artistic preference was for the anecdotal and the sentimental among 19th century genre artists, who found the fable ideal for their purposes. The most successful, and typical of many others, was Walter Hunt (1861–1941), whose \\"Dog in the Manger\\" (1885) was bought by the Chantrey Bequest and is now in Tate Britain. At least two versions exist of the work. In one two calves peer at a Jack Russell puppy that sits looking back in the hay that they want to eat. In the Tate version, a different breed is curled up asleep in their manger. The idiom was also put to figurative use during the 19th century. In much the same anecdotal tradition, the print-maker Thomas Lord Busby (active 1804–37) used the title to show a dyspeptic man eyeing askance a huge dinner, while hungry beggars and an importunate dog look on, in a work from 1826. Later on Charles H. Bennett revisited the scene in his The Fables of Aesop and Others Translated into Human Nature (1857), where a dog dressed as a footman and carrying food to his master bares his teeth at the poor ox begging at the door. In this case the fable was rewritten to fit the scenario. Such work, bordering on the cartoon, provided a profitable avenue for social commentary. An American example appeared in the illustration to a children's book of 1880, where a dog dressed as a ruffian stands on the straw, cudgel in hand, warning off a cow and her calf (see above). It ushers in use of the theme in illustrated papers a little later. J. S. Pughe's centrefold in Puck pictures a dog in the uniform of a U.S. Marine holding off European nations that wish to participate in the Nicaragua Canal scheme. It was followed by the cover cartoon of Harper's Weekly picturing William Jennings Bryan as the dog, obstructing the choice of the Democratic presidential candidacy and preventing others getting at the White House oats.

A parafoil is a nonrigid (textile) airfoil with an aerodynamic cell structure which is inflated by the wind. Ram-air inflation forces the parafoil into a classic wing cross-section. Parafoils are most commonly constructed out of ripstop nylon. The device was developed in 1964 by Domina Jalbert (1904–1991). Jalbert had a history of designing kites and was involved in the development of hybrid balloon-kite aerial platforms for carrying scientific instruments. He envisaged the parafoil would be used to suspend an aerial platform or for the recovery of space equipment. A patent was granted in 1966. Deployment shock prevented the parafoil's immediate acceptance as a parachute. It was not until the addition of a drag canopy on the riser lines (known as a \\"slider\\") which slowed their spread that the parafoil became a suitable parachute. Compared to a simple round canopy, a parafoil parachute has greater steerability, will glide further and allows greater control of the rate of descent; the parachute format is mechanically a glider of the free-flight kite type and such aspects spawned paraglider use. The air flow into the parafoil is coming more from below than the flight path might suggest, so the frontmost ropes tow against the airflow. When gliding, the angle of attack is lowered and the airflow meets the parafoil head on. This makes it difficult to achieve an optimum gliding angle without the parafoil deflating. In 1984 Jalbert was awarded the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) Gold Parachuting Medal for inventing the parafoil. Parafoils see wide use in a variety of windsports such as kite flying, powered parachutes, paragliding, kitesurfing, speed flying, wingsuit flying and skydiving. The world's largest kite is a parafoil-variant. Today, SpaceX uses steerable Parafoils to recover the Fairings of their Falcon 9 Rocket on two ships, GO Ms. Tree and GO Ms. Chief.

The mandibular branch of the fifth cranial nerve, the trigeminal nerve, innervates the medial pterygoid muscle. Structure It consists of two heads. * The bulk of the muscle arises as a deep head from just above the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate. * The smaller, superficial head originates from the maxillary tuberosity and the pyramidal process of the palatine bone. Its fibers pass downward, lateral, and posterior, and are inserted, by a strong tendinous lamina, into the lower and back part of the medial surface of the ramus and angle of the mandible, as high as the mandibular foramen. The insertion joins the masseter muscle to form a common tendinous sling which allows the medial pterygoid and masseter to be powerful elevators of the jaw. =Innervation= Medial pterygoid is innervated by nerve to medial pterygoid (a branch of the mandibular nerve), which also innervates tensor tympani and tensor veli palatini. Unlike the lateral pterygoid and all other muscles of mastication which are innervated by the anterior division of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, the medial pterygoid is innervated by the main trunk of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V), before the division. Function Given that the origin is on the medial side of the lateral pterygoid plate and the insertion is from the internal surface of the ramus of the mandible down to the angle of the mandible, its functions include: * Elevation of the mandible (closes the jaw) * Minor contribution to protrusion of the mandible * Assistance in mastication * Excursion of the mandible; contralateral excursion occurs with unilateral contraction.

Actors are the primitives that form the basis of the Actor model of concurrent digital computation. In response to a message that it receives, an Actor can make local decisions, create more Actors, send more messages, and designate how to respond to the next message received. Actor model theory incorporates theories of the events and structures of Actor computations, their proof theory, and denotational models. Events and their orderings From the definition of an Actor, it can be seen that numerous events take place: local decisions, creating Actors, sending messages, receiving messages, and designating how to respond to the next message received. However, this article focuses on just those events that are the arrival of a message sent to an Actor. This article reports on the results published in Hewitt [2006]. :Law of Countability: There are at most countably many events. =Activation ordering= The activation ordering (\`-≈→\`) is a fundamental ordering that models one event activating another (there must be energy flow in the message passing from an event to an event which it activates). *Because of the transmission of energy, the activation ordering is relativistically invariant; that is, for all events \`e1\`.\`e2\`, if \`e1 -≈→ e2\`, then the time of \`e1\` precedes the time of \`e2\` in the relativistic frames of reference of all observers. *Law of Strict Causality for the Activation Ordering: For no event does \`e -≈→ e\`. *Law of Finite Predecession in the Activation Ordering: For all events \`e1\` the set \`{ee -≈→ e1}\` is finite. =Arrival orderings= The arrival ordering of an Actor \`x\` ( \`-x→ \`) models the (total) ordering of events in which a message arrives at \`x\`. Arrival ordering is determined by arbitration in processing messages (often making use of a digital circuit called an arbiter). The arrival events of an Actor are on its world line. The arrival ordering means that the Actor model inherently has indeterminacy (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation). *Because all of the events of the arrival ordering of an actor \`x\` happen on the world line of \`x\`, the arrival ordering of an actor is relativistically invariant. I.e., for all actors \`x\` and events \`e1\`.\`e2\`, if \`e1 -x→ e2\`, then the time of \`e1\` precedes the time of \`e2\` in the relativistic frames of reference of all observers. *Law of Finite Predecession in Arrival Orderings: For all events \`e1\` and Actors \`x\` the set \`{ee -x→ e1}\` is finite. =Combined ordering= The combined ordering (denoted by \`→\`) is defined to be the transitive closure of the activation ordering and the arrival orderings of all Actors. *The combined ordering is relativistically invariant because it is the transitive closure of relativistically invariant orderings. I.e., for all events \`e1\`.\`e2\`, if \`e1→e2\`. then the time of \`e1\` precedes the time of \`e2\` in the relativistic frames of reference of all observers. *Law of Strict Causality for the Combined Ordering: For no event does \`e→e\`. The combined ordering is obviously transitive by definition. In [Baker and Hewitt 197?], it was conjectured that the above laws might entail the following law: :Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering: There are no infinite chains (i.e., linearly ordered sets) of events between two events in the combined ordering →. =Independence of the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering= However, [Clinger 1981] surprisingly proved that the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering is independent of the previous laws, i.e., Theorem. The Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering does not follow from the previously stated laws. Proof. It is sufficient to show that there is an Actor computation that satisfies the previously stated laws but violates the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering. :Consider a computation which begins when an actor Initial is sent a \`Start\` message causing it to take the following actions :#Create a new actor Greeter1 which is sent the message \`SayHelloTo\` with the address of Greeter1 :#Send Initial the message \`Again\` with the address of Greeter1 :Thereafter the behavior of Initial is as follows on receipt of an \`Again\` message with address Greeteri (which we will call the event \`Againi\`): :#Create a new actor Greeteri+1 which is sent the message \`SayHelloTo\` with address Greeteri :#Send Initial the message \`Again\` with the address of Greeteri+1 :Obviously the computation of Initial sending itself \`Again\` messages never terminates. :The behavior of each Actor Greeteri is as follows: :*When it receives a message \`SayHelloTo\` with address Greeteri-1 (which we will call the event \`SayHelloToi\`), it sends a \`Hello\` message to Greeteri-1 :*When it receives a \`Hello\` message (which we will call the event \`Helloi\`), it does nothing. :Now it is possible that \`Helloi -Greeteri→ SayHelloToi\` every time and therefore \`Helloi→SayHelloToi\`. :Also \`Againi -≈→ Againi+1\` every time and therefore \`Againi → Againi+1\`. :Furthermore all of the laws stated before the Law of Strict Causality for the Combined Ordering are satisfied. :However, there may be an infinite number of events in the combined ordering between \`Again1\` and \`SayHelloTo1\` as follows: :\`Again1→...→Againi→...\\\\infty...→Helloi→SayHelloToi→...→Hello1→SayHelloTo1\` However, we know from physics that infinite energy cannot be expended along a finite trajectory. Therefore, since the Actor model is based on physics, the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering was taken as an axiom of the Actor model. =Law of Discreteness= The Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering is closely related to the following law: :Law of Discreteness: For all events \`e1\` and \`e2\`, the set \`{ee1→e→e2}\` is finite. In fact the previous two laws have been shown to be equivalent: :Theorem [Clinger 1981]. The Law of Discreteness is equivalent to the Law of Finite Chains Between Events in the Combined Ordering (without using the axiom of choice.) The law of discreteness rules out Zeno machines and is related to results on Petri nets [Best et al. 1984, 1987]. The Law of Discreteness implies the property of unbounded nondeterminism. The combined ordering is used by [Clinger 1981] in the construction of a denotational model of Actors (see denotational semantics). Denotational semantics Clinger [1981] used the Actor event model described above to construct a denotational model for Actors using power domains. Subsequently Hewitt [2006] augmented the diagrams with arrival times to construct a technically simpler denotational model that is easier to understand.

Examples of these special items include a cup of coffee, a tailored suit, and a car. Outside of the business world, the term is used to describe a child or young adult who is learning how to do tasks and is sent to fetch items. A similar job is that of peon in Commonwealth countries. Etymology Gofer is a linguistic simplification of the two words go + for = gofor. Simplified, in English, it means go for this or go for that. Gofor reflects the likelihood of instructions to go for coffee, dry cleaning, or stamps, or to make other straightforward, familiar or unfamiliar procurements. The term gofer originated in North America. Career opportunities Likewise gofer may refer to a junior member of an organisation who generally receive the most vexing and thankless work. Law firms with a top-heavy management structure, having not enough junior lawyers to take care of menial yet necessary tasks, can be referred to as having \\"too many loafers and not enough gophers\\". In popular culture In the 1953 movie She's Back on Broadway, at about the 11 minute mark, the word is used backstage at a Broadway show, with a clear explanation. In the first season (1976) of the television series The Muppet Show, Scooter was given the stage manager job because his uncle owned the theater where the Muppets performed. The pun was that a gopher not only is an animal, like the Muppets supposedly are, but is a fast animal, collecting food and delivering it somewhere else. At some point in the Muppets series, Kermit the Frog suggested that he himself was a gofer, but probably didn't last long in the job. In the fourth season of Boy Meets World, Corey gets a job as a gofer for two shady businessmen (Buddy Hackett and Soupy Sales). Another example of a gofer is the fictional character of Salvatore \\"Turtle\\" Assante (Jerry Ferrara) on the comedy-drama HBO television series Entourage. Chavo Guerrero was considered to be a gofer for his aunt Vickie Guerrero on WWE's SmackDown for most of 2008 (Vickie was SmackDown's General Manager at the time) when they were both part of the villainous La Familia stable. This would become a sporadic running joke on WWE programming as other superstars would mock Chavo for this reason. In the Taxi episode \\"Alex the Gofer\\", Alex takes a part-time job as an assistant to Broadway producers. The term gofer is used in the anime Zombie-Loan. Brad Pitt's character Cliff Booth is a gofer for Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the 2019 movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

It lies superiorly to the medial pterygoid.

The lower/inferior head originates on the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and inserts onto the neck of condyloid process of the mandible; upper/superior head Innervation The mandibular branch of the fifth cranial nerve, the trigeminal nerve, specifically the lateral pterygoid nerve, innervates the lateral pterygoid muscle. Function The primary function of the lateral pterygoid muscle is to pull the head of the condyle out of the mandibular fossa along the articular eminence to protrude the mandible. A concerted effort of the lateral pterygoid muscles helps in lowering the mandible and opening the jaw, whereas unilateral action of a lateral pterygoid produces contralateral excursion (a form of mastication), usually performed in concert with the medial pterygoids. Unlike the other three muscles of mastication, the lateral pterygoid is the only muscle of mastication that assists in depressing the mandible (opening the jaw). At the beginning of this action it is assisted by the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles. Additional images File:Gray146.pngSphenoid bone. Anterior and inferior surfaces.

It has an important place in traditional Malian culture and has, more recently, become a symbol of Malian cultural identity. The cloth is exported worldwide for use in fashion, fine art and decoration. Origins and etymology The dye technique is associated with several Malian ethnic groups, but the Bambaran version has become best known outside Mali. In the Bambara language, the word bògòlanfini is a composite of bɔgɔ, meaning \\"earth\\" or \\"mud\\"; lan, meaning \\"with\\" or \\"by means of\\"; and fini, meaning \\"cloth\\". Although usually translated as \\"mud cloth,\\" bogolan actually refers to a clay slip with a high iron content that produces a black pigment when applied to handspun and handwoven cotton textiles. Production Bògòlanfini in the market of Enndé The center of bògòlanfini production, and the source of the highest quality cloth, is the town of San.. =Traditional production= In traditional bògòlanfini production, men weave the cloth and women dye it. On narrow looms, strips of cotton fabric about wide are woven and stitched into cloths about wide and long. The dyeing (a \\"strange and cumbersome technique\\", according to the 1973 opinion of J.B. Donne.) begins with a step invisible in the finished product: the cloth is soaked in a dye bath made from leaves of the n'gallama (Anogeissus leiocarpa) tree that have been mashed and boiled, or soaked. Now yellow, the cloth is sun-dried and then painted with designs using a piece of metal or wood. The paint, carefully and repeatedly applied to outline the intricate motifs, is a special mud, collected from riverbeds and fermented for up to a year in a clay jar. Because of a chemical reaction between the mud and the dyed cloth, the brown color remains after the mud is washed off. Finally, the yellow n'gallama dye is removed from the unpainted parts of the cloth by applying soap or bleach, rendering the finished cloth white. After long use, the very dark brown color turns a variety of rich tones of brown, while the unpainted underside of the fabric retains a pale russet color. File:BogolanMali32.JPG File:Ségou (8).JPG File:Ségou (10).JPG File:Ségou (12).JPG =Variants and modern production= Around Mopti and Djenné, a simpler method is used by artists considered to be of inferior skill. The cloth is dyed yellow in wolo solution, made from the leaves of Terminalia avicennoides, and then painted over with black designs. The yellow is either removed, producing a stark black and white design, or painted a deep orange with a solution from the bark of M'Peku (Lannea velutina). Based on these simplified techniques, as of around 2000, large quantities of bògòlanfini are being mass-produced for the tourist and export markets. These fabrics use simpler designs, often applied by stencil, painted in black on a yellow or orange background. With this method, the cloth can be produced about six to seven times faster. The democratic reforms after the overthrow of Moussa Traoré in 1991 caused many young men to lose their previously guaranteed government jobs and scholarships. This led many to take up bògòlanfini production. Consequently, most cloth is now produced by men rather than women, and the traditional year-long apprenticeships have been replaced by short, informal training sessions. Cultural significance In traditional Malian culture, bògòlanfini is worn by hunters and serves as camouflage, ritual protection and a badge of status. Women are wrapped in bògòlanfini after their initiation into adulthood (which includes genital cutting) and immediately after childbirth, as the cloth is believed to have the power to absorb the dangerous forces released under such circumstances. Bògòlanfini patterns are rich in cultural significance, referring to historical events (such as a famous battle between a Malian warrior and the French), crocodiles (significant in Bambara mythology) or other objects, mythological concepts or proverbs. Since about 1980, Bògòlanfini has become a symbol of Malian cultural identity and is being promoted as such by the Malian government. Uses Bògòlanfini has become a popular Malian export, notably to the United States. There, it is marketed as \\"mud cloth\\", either as a symbol of African American culture or as a generically \\"ethnic\\" decorative cloth. =In fashion= A Bogolanfini shirt (dashiki) In Mali, the cloth is worn by people of all ethnicities, including prominently in Malian cinema and by Malian musicians, either as an expression of national or ethnic identity or as a fashion statement. Particularly popular among young people, bògòlanfini is made into a wide range of clothes, including Western miniskirts and jackets as well as traditional flowing robes (boubous). The Malian fashion designer Chris Seydou has been credited with popularizing bògòlanfini in international fashion. =In art= Bògòlanfini is also produced as fine art by several Malian artists, notably by the Groupe Bogolan Kasobané, six artists collaborating since 1978. These paintings are produced with vegetable dyes and mud, but often feature designs unrelated to those of traditional fabrics; their newer motifs are also often found on clothing. Other notable creators include Nakunte Diarra. Traditional bògòlanfini designs are also used for on a wide range of commercial products, such as coffee mugs, curtains, towels, sheets, book covers and wrapping paper.

They are believed to have originated in the New Haven, Connecticut region of Long Island Sound, United States. They were traditional fishing boats used for oystering, and later appeared in other areas. With centerboards and shallow balanced rudders they are well suited to sailing in shallow tidal waters. 35ft New Haven Oyster Sharpie, built about 1890 Traditional sharpies =New Haven sharpies= Oyster Sharpie, Quinipiac River, Connecticut Sharpies first became popular in New Haven, Connecticut, towards the end of the 19th century. They came into use as a successor to the dugout log canoe and most likely were derived from the flatiron skiff. In an 1879 edition of Forest and Stream, a man named Goodsell claimed to have built the first sharpie with his brother in 1848 and his claim was never contested. These sharpies were typically used for oyster tonging and evolved to suit that work. They grew in popularity because they were easy to row, cheap to build and fast under sail. Varying in length, the 24–28 ft one-man boats usually had one sail, while the larger two-man boats which were around 35 ft were rigged with two sails, as cat-ketches. They had leg-o-mutton sails with sprit booms on un-stayed masts. The larger boats had three mast-steps; one at the bow, one amidships and one in between. Typically, in the summer, two masts would be stepped: one at the bow and amidships. In the winter, when heavier winds were expected, a single mast would be stepped in between. Their hulls were narrow with a large sheer and low freeboard. At the ends you will find a plumb bow with the heel of the stem sitting just out of the water and a round stern. The centerboard was long and shallow as was the balanced rudder. =Migration= The sharpie type migrated south and west to other regions where shallow water prevented deep-draft vessels from operating, including Chesapeake Bay, the Carolinas, the Great Lakes (Ohio) and Florida. Although most sharpies were rigged as a leg-o-mutton cat-ketch with free standing masts and sprit booms, larger versions - especially those found in the Carolinas and Florida - used stayed gaff schooner rigs which included a jib. =Further development and variations= Egret replica at The Barnacle Historic State Park, Miami, Florida Sharpies were introduced to Florida in 1881, when Commodore Ralph Munroe brought the 33-foot New Haven style sharpie, of his own design, Kingfish to the Miami area of Florida. Perhaps the most famous of sharpies was the Commodore's Egret design, now immortalized in plans available from WoodenBoat magazine. Commodore Monroe designed Egret in 1886 and had her built on Staten Island and delivered to Key West. Egret was unique in that she had higher, flaring sides than the typical sharpie and was double- ended. This meant more stability as she was loaded and the ability to run before a following sea without waves breaking over the stern. These attributes contributed to behavior that led the Commodore to call the Egret a \\"sharpie- lifeboat\\". Throughout the late 19th century, the Commodore and others helped to evolve the type. Various sharpie yachts were designed by those who found the lines of working sharpies appealing. Thomas Clapham used a v-bottom in his \\"Nonpareil sharpies\\", and Larry Huntington introduced a rounded, arc bottom that has been used by modern designers like Bruce Kirby and Reuel Parker. Some believe the Chesapeake Bay skipjack with its v-bottom may have evolved from the early sharpies. Whatever the case, Chesapeake sharpie skiffs were common, especially in the smaller sizes, because of their easy and cheap construction. Howard I. Chapelle, a naval architect and curator of maritime history, wrote several books on traditional work boats and boat building, some of which include sharpie design and construction. He was a particular advocate of pleasure boats based on work boat models and designed many sharpie sailboats, cruisers and yachts. For a typical example of his work, see the article on a 14-foot sharpie. Modern sharpies 19 foot Ohio sharpie, Reuel Parker design. A modern sharpie design based on traditional lines In recent years, the sharpie, as with many traditional American small craft, has enjoyed renewed interest as designers and sailors have sought boats with the virtues of shallow draft and ease of construction. However, most are home-built or of one-off construction. Exceptions include Bruce Kirby's Norwalk Islands series of sharpies, Catbird 24 by Chesapeake Marine design, Johns Sharpie by Chesapeake Light Craft, Ted Brewer's Mystic Sharpie, various designs by Parker Marine, and Phil Bolger's unique designs. Design considerations Like dories, sharpies are initially tender since they have a shallow draft without a keel. They need large amounts of ballast stowed on the central floor before they become acceptable as sea boats: 600 to 900 lbs is normal in a 30 ft boat. Sharpies rely on their high flared topsides to provide stability when heeled on a reach or to windward. The twin unstayed masts makes rigging very easy and saves on cost. The unstayed flexible masts also allow wind to be spilled from the sails which helps with stability. The flat bottom, narrow water line and ample working sail means the boat is fast down wind where the flat bottom helps promote surfing or planing in stronger winds. The narrow beam, the high center of gravity, the low aspect ratio of the centre board and the longitudinal rudder shape do not help windward performance, but mostly these same features help in shallow waters or where the boat has to change direction often, such as in a tidal or rocky estuary. Cabin sharpies are an acquired taste due to the space taken up by the large central centerboard case and the restricted headroom. Even a 30-foot traditional sharpie is only suited to a maximum of 2 people when cruising for a week. A sharpie does not have the strong self-righting ability of a more conventional deep keeled yacht, so it is best suited to sheltered waters. It needs an experienced skipper who understands the foibles of the design. Sharpie style hulls that are developed in New Zealand are made of plywood, use water ballast in underseat tanks that empty when trailered, vertical (dagger) ballasted boards (about 80-100 lbs) type centerboards (hoisted with a simple 4:1 block arrangement led back to the cockpit) and are commonly about 20–24 feet LOA. They are not traditionally rigged, instead having conventional fractional sloop rigs. They went through a brief period of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. Designers such as Ian Oughtred have produced modern versions that incorporate many traditional features while addressing some of the drawbacks, in particular the replacement of the shallow, balanced rudder (which had a tendency to lead to wild and erratic steering in big following seas) with a more conventional transom-hung pivoting rudder blade. The Haiku design also has fully battened sails in an effort to improve windward performance. Oughtred offers the Haiku with either twin swinging centreboards, which give more interior room, at the expense of hydrodynamic efficiency, or a single central board, which takes up more space. At 30 feet long the Haiku is set up for a small family to cruise in sheltered waters. Phil Bolger designed a rudimentary solution to the problem of hull slap at anchor, which effects flat bottom boats, by making a 3 foot long, oval shaped anti-slap pad of multiple layers of ply about 2 inches deep, which were then rounded into a shallow arc. The noise is the same as chine slap familiar to owners of deep-V powerboats at anchor. Other designers have made the forefoot deeper so that it is immersed in the water at rest. Owners have found that putting extra weight in the bow and lowering the centreboard when anchored at night reduces the noise which is accentuated by thinner ply and lighter overall construction.

Prior to this he was a worship pastor at Hillsong Church in Sydney, Australia. He has written songs such as \\"Eagles Wings\\", \\"Hear Our Praises\\", \\"I Give You My Heart\\", \\"My Redeemer Lives\\" and \\"Mighty to Save\\", which won the Worship Song of the Year at the 40th GMA Dove Awards. In 2005 his first solo worship album, World Through Your Eyes, debuted at No. 3 in the Australian Christian Charts. Biography In 2005, Morgan signed with Rocketown Records. The company released his debut album in the United States, but four of the original songs were removed in favour of cover versions of Hillsong songs written by Morgan. In addition, the remaining songs were remixed and the resulting songs had a heavier feel when compared to the softer pop-rock originals. Morgan has toured extensively around the United States, Canada and Europe. A 2007 European tour featured events in Scotland, England, Germany and Sweden. Everyone, contains Morgan's interpretation of his music and was mostly written in the previous 18 months, recorded in a big sounding, studio worship without the congregational elements found in the Hillsong Live albums.The Hillsong Live recordings are made in the megachurch and feature live worship and singing from the congregation. Everyone largely featured covers of previously released Hillsong songs written by Morgan and was released in Australia on 2 October 2006. Morgan officially became Hillsong's new worship pastor in 2008, succeeding Darlene Zschech, however, Zschech continued to be a worship leader of the Hillsong Worship Team until 2012. On 29 June 2010, Hillsong Live released A Beautiful Exchange, an album featuring songs by Morgan. Morgan led Hillsong's 2010 tour of the United States, which kicked off on 21 July and included events in Dallas, Detroit and Los Angeles.  Hillsong  Morgan's first songwriting contribution to Hillsong's live praise and worship albums was the song \\"I Give You My Heart\\", which was featured on the Hillsong live album God is in the House. Morgan himself, however, did not perform on the album; the lead vocals for this performance were sung by Steve McPherson. Morgan later recorded his own interpretation of \\"I Give You My Heart\\" for his first solo album, World Through Your Eyes. Morgan made his first official performing appearance on Hillsong's next live album, All Things are Possible, playing acoustic guitar and contributing three original compositions to this album. One of these songs, \\"Shadow of Your Wings\\", was an outtake on the live audio recording, although it did appear on the video recording. Reuben performed co- lead vocals on the live recording of \\"Shadow Of Your Wings\\" together with Darlene Zschech, although he was not credited as a vocalist for this album. His two other songwriting contributions to All Things are Possible were \\"In Your Hands\\", which was sung by Rob Eastwood and Donia Makedonez; and \\"Your Love\\", which was sung by Miriam Webster and Lisa Young. Over time Morgan would become a prolific songwriter for Hillsong. The next four Hillsong live albums (Touching Heaven Changing Earth, By Your Side, and You Are My World) featured songwriting contributions and acoustic guitars from Morgan, although he did not sing lead vocals on any of these recordings. His first official credit as a vocalist was on the album For This Cause. But it was not until Hillsong's 2002 live album, Blessed, where he first contributed a lead vocal, which was on the track \\"Most High\\". The song \\"Mighty to Save\\", from the 2006 Hillsong album of the same name, was written by Morgan and Ben Fielding, with lead vocals performed by Morgan. It was nominated for \\"Song of the Year\\" and won \\"Worship Song of the Year\\" at the 40th GMA Dove Awards.http://jesusfreakhideout.com/news/2009/04/24.DOVE%20AWARDS%20CELEBRATES%2040th%20YEAR%20WITH%20GOOD%20NEWS%20FOR%20STEVEN%20CURTIS%20CHAPMAN%20BRANDON%20HEATH%20AND%20CASTING%20CROWNS.asp Personal life He is married to Sarah and they have three children.

Cosmic Cube The Caltech Cosmic Cube was developed by Chuck Seitz et al. at Caltech providing architectural support for Actor systems. A significant difference between the Cosmic Cube and most other parallel processors is that this multiple instruction multiple-data machine uses message passing instead of shared variables for communication between concurrent processes. This computational model is reflected in the hardware structure and operating system, and is also the explicit message passing communication seen by the programmer. According to Seitz [1985]: :It was a premise of the Cosmic Cube experiment that the internode communication should scale well to very large numbers of nodes. A direct network like the hypercube satisfies this requirement, with respect to both the aggregate bandwidth achieved across the many concurrent communication channels and the feasibility of the implementation. The hypercube is actually a distributed variant of an indirect logarithmic switching network like the Omega or banyan networks: the kind that might be used in shared-storage organizations. With the hypercube, however, communication paths traverse different numbers of channels and so exhibit different latencies. It is possible, therefore, to take advantage of communication locality in placing processes in nodes. J–Machine The J–Machine was developed by Bill Dally et al. at MIT providing architectural support suitable for Actors. This included the following: *Asynchronous messaging *A uniform space of Actor addresses to which messages could be sent concurrently regardless of whether the recipient Actor was local or nonlocal *A form of Actor pipelining (see Actor model) Concurrent Smalltalk (which can be modeled using Actors) was developed to program the J Machine. Prototype Actor Programming Language Hewitt [2006] presented a prototype Actor programming language in the sense that it directly expresses important aspects of the behavior of Actors. Messages are expressed in XML using the notation \`:<tag>[<element>1 ... <element>] for\` :\`“<”<tag>“>” <element>1 ... <element>n “<”/<tag>“>”\` The semantics of the programming language are defined by defining each program construct as an Actor with its own behavior. Execution is modeled by having Eval messages passed among program constructs during execution. =Environment Actors= Each \`Eval\` message has the address of an Actor that acts as an environment with the bindings of program identifiers. Environment Actors are immutable, i.e., they do not change. When \`Request[Bind[identifier value] customer]\` is received by an Actor Environment, a new environment Actor is created such that when the new environment Actor receives \`Request[Lookup[identifier’] customer’]\` then if \`identifier\` is the same as \`identifier’\` send \`customer’\` \`Returned[value]\`, else send \`Environment Request[Lookup[identifier’] customer’]\`.

Together with producers Tim Kellett and Robin Taylor-Firth, she formed the British band Olive. The band's single \\"You're Not Alone\\" reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart on its second release in 1997. In 1999 she sang lead vocals on tracks \\"Gravity of Love\\" and \\"Silence Must be Heard\\" on Enigma's album The Screen Behind the Mirror, the former of which was also released as a single. She also performed guest-vocals for their 2003 album Voyageur. Her first solo album What about Us?, produced by Michael Cretu of Enigma, was only released as a digital download via iTunes in 2007, quoting a lack of necessary project support and co-ordination to produce physical copies of the album. Biography Influenced by singers like Rickie Lee Jones and Joni Mitchell, Boyle joined various bands from age 17–19, but these turned out to be unpleasant experiences (\\"folk bands, Rickie Lee Jones and stuff like that, all the angst\\"). In the intervening time, she performed assembly-line work in factories before ending up managing a pub in Sheffield. Meanwhile, she also recorded vocal samples for The Durutti Column, the Manchester-based musical project headed by Vini Reilly. However, Boyle was considering a career in nursing by the time Kellett, who had heard the vocal samples pre-recorded onto a keyboard while playing live with The Durutti Column, contacted her about singing for the group he had formed with Taylor-Firth. After auditioning, Boyle found in the band an ideal musical collaboration. Olive produced two albums from its inception in 1995 to 2000, after which the band ceased to work together. During the production of Olive's second album under Madonna's label Maverick and titled as Trickle, Boyle met Michael Cretu, mastermind behind the 1990s leading new age/pop project of Enigma, who had heard one of her songs (Miracle) in Ibiza and he invited her to participate on his fourth concept album The Screen Behind the Mirror (1999). Boyle sang the lead vocals on two tracks on the album, one of them was released as the lead single titled \\"Gravity of Love\\" and afterward Boyle also performed as a female voice for the more commercial pop oriented Voyageur album on tracks \\"Boum-boum\\" and \\"Following the Sun\\" in late 2003. Because of their successful collaboration, they produced a solo debut album, which was then produced in A.R.T. Studios in Ibiza, late 2004. The album was named What about Us?. After numerous delays, the album was digitally released in June 2007. Discography =Albums= With Olive *Extra Virgin (1997) *Trickle (2000) Solo *What about Us?

The band released two albums in 1988 and 1993 respectively. The band then reformed in 2009 and have toured extensively, as well as releasing new material: a live EP of past hits and an album of new material Rapture in 2012. and \\"Spin\\" in 2015. The current line-up is Leigh Matty, Craig Joiner, Stephen Drennan and Andy Welsford. John Victor \\"Rhino\\" Edwards from Status Quo is a regular guest with the band live. History The original manager of the band was Olga Lange, then the wife of Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange. Mutt Lange was impressed by their songwriting abilities and agreed to produce (part of) their debut album. Hence, Romeo's Daughter was often seen as protégés of Mutt Lange. The first album contained the singles \\"Don't Break My Heart\\", \\"I Cry Myself to Sleep at Night\\", covered by Bonnie Tyler and Chrissy Steele and \\"Heaven in the Back Seat\\", the latter from the A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child soundtrack. The album was produced by Mutt Lange and John Parr. \\"Wild Child\\" (written by Mutt Lange) was later covered by Heart on the Brigade album, and \\"Heaven in the Back Seat\\" was covered by Eddie Money on his 1991 album, Right Here. The second album, Delectable was a more mature affair, although it was released on the smaller Music for Nations label so got less exposure. Mitman went on to work with FM and other bands while the band broke up in the mid 1990s. On 25 February 2008, Romeo's Daughter's first studio album was reissued by Rock Candy Records on CD with bonus material, a 16-page full colour booklet with original and new artwork, etc. After this reissue Romeo's Daughter reformed and were performing shows. These appearances included a small warm up gig on 13 October 2009, and their main event of 2009 was Firefest VI at Nottingham Rock City on 24 October 2009. In 2009, the band announced that they would be releasing new material through Riff City Records in the \\"near future\\". The band played some dates during 2010 and performed new material. The band's second album, Delectable, was reissued in July 2011. On 22 October 2011, Romeo's Daughter released a three-track live EP available via download sites such as iTunes. In March 2012, the band released their first new album in 19 years, Rapture and during 2012 they performed more live tour dates. In 2012, lead singer, Leigh Matty, was voted Number 5 Lady Rock Singer of all time in Classic Rock and their single 'Bittersweet' was in their 'Top songs of 2012' chart. During 2013, the band toured the UK and performed at festivals including Fairport's Cropredy Convention and Hard Rock Hell. A live album and DVD filmed live at Derby Guildhall was released in 2014. In 2015, the band released another album of new music titled Spin, which they toured Europe to promote.

Charles (1912), Porches & Fonts.Pub. Wells, Gardner, Darton & Co., Ltd., London. P. 66. Kirkdale sundial The Saxon sundial at St Gregory's Minster, Kirkdale in North Yorkshire, near Kirkbymoorside, is an ancient canonical sundial which dates to the mid 11th century. The panel containing the actual sundial above the church doors is flanked by two panels, bearing a rare inscription in Old English, the language of the Anglo-Saxons. The sundial, discovered during a renovation in 1771, commemorates the rebuilding of the ruined church, about the year 1055, by Orm, son of Gamal, whose Scandinavian names suggest that he may have been a descendant of Vikings who overran and settled this region in the late 9th century. Inscription The inscription on the sundial reads as follows: :+ ORM GAMAL / SVNA BOHTE SCS / GREGORIVS MIN / STER ÐONNE HI / T ǷFS ÆL TOBRO // CAN 7 TOFALAN 7 HE / HIT LET MACAN NEǷAN FROM / GRVNDE ΧΡE 7 SCS GREGORI / VS IN EADǷARD DAGVM CNG / 7 [I]N TOSTI DAGVM EORL + :Orm Gamal suna bohte Sanctus Gregorius Minster ðonne hit wæs æl tobrocan and tofalan and he hit let macan newan from grunde Christe and Sanctus Gregorius in Eadward dagum cyning and in Tosti dagum eorl. (ǷFS may be an error for ǷES, though if the letters were originally painted, as seems quite possible, the E may have appeared intact. The Anglo-Saxon character represented in this transcription by '7' stands for the conjunction 'and'. Several characters in the Anglo-Saxon alphabet but no longer used in English appear in the inscriptions. Ð/ð (called 'eth')is equivalent to modern 'th', as also is þ (called 'thorn'). Ƿ (called 'wynn') is equivalent to modern 'w'; and Æ/æ (called 'ash') is here equivalent to modern 'a'). :\\"Orm son of Gamal bought St Gregory's Minster when it was all ruined and collapsed and he caused it to be made new from the ground for Christ and St. Gregory in the days of Edward the king and in the days of Tosti the eorl.\\" St Gregory's Minster The sundial itself is inscribed :+ ÞIS IS DÆGES SOLMERCA + / ÆT ILCVM TIDE :þis is dæges solmerca, æt ilcum tide. :\\"This is the day's sun-marker, at every tide.\\" And at the bottom of the central panel is the line :+7 HAǷARÐ ME ǷROHTE 7 BRAND / PRS :and Hawarð me wrohte and Brand presbyter(i) [or preostas] . :\\"And Haward wrought me and Brand priest(s).\\" The reference is to Edward the Confessor and Earl Tostig, Edward's brother-in-law, who was the son of Earl Godwin of Wessex and the brother of Harold. Tostig held the Earldom of Northumbria from 1055 to 1065, fixing the date of the church's reconstruction to that decade. He is also known for the murder of Gamal, Orm's father. The language of the inscription is late Old English, with a failing case and gender system. The compound solmerca is otherwise unattested in English, and has been ascribed to Scandinavian influence (Old Norse solmerki 'sign of the zodiac'). The Historic England Web site, which lists St Gregory's as Grade I, provides the following translation of the full, three part inscription: \\"Orm Gamal's son bought St. Gregory's Minster when it was all broken down and fallen and he let it be made anew from the ground to Christ and St. Gregory, in Edward's days, the king, and in Tosti's days, the Earl. This is day's Sun marker at every tide. And Haworth me wrought and Brand, priests.\\" The last two sentences are more fully translated by some sources as: \\"This is the day’s sun-marking at every hour. And Hawarth made me and Brand priest(s)\\" The Journal of the Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society. (Volume 69), published in 1997, offers more persuasive interpretations of the final sentence: \\"First, it makes two statements: that Hawarth made the sundial (that is, he was the craftsman), and that Brand was the priest. The second interpretation is that both Hawarth (who was probably a craftsman and could have been a priest) and Brand the priest (acting as his assistant or instructor), together made the sundial. Higgitt has suggested that 'Brand was perhaps responsible for the drafting and laying out of the text, and perhaps too for the design of the sundial'.27\\" https://archive.org/stream/YAJ0691997/YAJ0691997_djvu.txt, p=103 (The Higgitt referred to is John Higgitt who was a medieval scholar who specialized in analyses of Anglo-Saxon inscriptions. He contributed to a 1997 Medieval Archaeology journal report, Kirkdale - The inscriptions, 41. Vol 41, pp. 51-99.)http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-769-1/dissemination/pdf/vol41/41_051_099.pdf Part of the sundial's historical significance is its testimony that, a century and a half after the Viking colonisation of the region, the settlers' descendants such as Orm Gamalson were now using English, not Danish or Norwegian, as the appropriate language for monumental inscriptions.[The Story of English episode 2 - The Mother Tongue — Part 4 / 7, PBS Documentary.

They have issued eleven studio albums. Known for their strong DIY ethic, the band members continue to drive their own tour bus, create their own artwork and T-shirt designs, and operate their own record label. Poster Children were also pioneers in several forms of electronic technology relating to performance art, including enhanced CDs, webcasts, and blogs. History Rick Valentin and Rose Marshack met in the mid-eighties at the University of Illinois and formed several bands in rapid succession. When the two met drummer Shannon Drew in 1987, their like-minded enthusiasm sparked the beginning of a new band, dubbed Poster Children. As Valentin explained in November 1991: They began selling their first album Toreador Squat on cassette and playing clubs in the Midwest. The following year, the band recorded songs with producer Iain Burgess, followed by five more songs produced with Steve Albini:Trouser Press Record Guide (4th Ed.); Ira Robbins, ed.; 1991, Collier Books, NY). the resulting album Flower Plower was released in 1989 on the Limited Potential label. It was also at this time that Poster Children picked up a second guitarist in order to complete their four-piece configuration. A major label record deal was signed with Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Reprise Records. Over the next few albums, Poster Children would be shuffled from imprint to imprint within the Warner organization. Tracks for Daisychain Reaction were recorded by Steve Albini at the Chicago Recording Company in 1990, but due to financial difficulties at the label, the album was not released until the following year. The album included Hum bassist Jeff Dimpsey on guitar. In 1991 Rick's brother, Jim, replaced Dimpsey, and remains to this day. Tool of the Man was recorded in 1992 at Dreamland Studio in New York with John Herndon (celebrated Tortoise percussionist) on drums. Tool of the Man was also released in the UK on the Creation label. The track \\"Clock Street\\" was picked as their only UK single to date. Just Like You and Junior Citizen followed, with modest but consistent sales. Matt Friscia auditioned for the band in 1993 as a high school student willing to drop out to go on tour, but the band didn't want to contribute to his delinquency, and hired Howie Kantoff instead. Friscia was available again in 2001 when the band was searching for its seventh (and current) drummer. The band was on the second stage for Lollapalooza in 1995. Rick Valentin and Rose Marshack are married and have hosted the long running podcast Radio Zero since 1999.They both are professors in the Arts Technology program at Illinois State University. Music Poster Children usually write their music collectively, leaving Rick to create lyrics after the fact. During the band's formative years, they wrote and recorded with a different drummer for each album. This resulted in a fluctuating style that touched on pop punk, post hardcore, what the band refers to as \\"post wave\\", and new wave revival. Their music is made up of angular, overdriven guitar parts, strong basslines, and powerful yet intricate drums. The typical Poster Children song is high-energy and hard, yet melodic, and they often use unusual time signatures. Rick Valentin's lyrics are by turns witty and introspective, often obliquely related to political issues. Poster Children have not had much commercial success or industry recognition, but critics consistently describe the band as catchy, impressive, and underrated. Despite their longevity, \\"the Poster Children don't have it in them to make a bad album\\".Record Reviews, The Austin Chronicle (Austin, TX), March 17, 2000. The band's \\"unique brand of smart pop-punk\\"PopMatters, 2004. makes them \\"definitely one of the more underrated college-rock bands to emerge in the '90s\\".The Onion (A.V. Club), March 10, 2010. Other music projects Marshack and the Valentin brothers have continued to work with former drummer Howie Kantoff outside of the Poster Children lineup. The four have recorded techno and electronic music under the name Salaryman. The group has released three studio albums: Salaryman (1997); Karoshi (1999); and The Electric Forest (2006). Since 2012 Rick Valentin also fronts a solo project named Thoughts Detecting Machines (TDM). Under this project he has released two EP's titled An Introduction to (2012); and Forget (2013), along with two albums Work the Circuits (2015) and Sound, Noise, & You (2019).

Together with Breakneck Ridge on the opposite bank of the river it forms \\"Wey-Gat\\" or Wind Gate, the picturesque northern narrows of the Hudson Highlands. Its distinctive curved ridge is the most prominent aspect of the view south down Newburgh Bay, from Newburgh, Beacon, and the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge. It can also be seen by southbound travelers on nearby sections of the New York State Thruway. This view was a popular subject for early artists of the Hudson River School. While thought of as the highest point in the area, its summit reaching approximately above sea level, the eastern summit known officially as Butter Hill is actually higher, with an elevation of . Name Storm King, by Homer Dodge Martin (1836 ..1897), in the style of the Hudson River School. During his initial voyage up the river, Henry Hudson and his crew named the mountain Klinkesberg, due to its wrinkled rock cliffs near the river. Later, the early Dutch colonists of the region referred to the mountain simply as \\"Boterberg\\" (Butter Hill, since the mountain looked like a lump of butter; the English translation was later the common name for the mountain). During the middle of the 19th century, writer Nathaniel Parker Willis, who had become a resident in the region, proposed the name Storm King: The section of New York State Route 218 that winds around the eastern slope of the mountain overlooking the River Hudson was named originally the Storm King Highway. That name is often used presently for the four-lane section of U.S. Route 9W to the west, with Route 218 referred to as the Old Storm King Highway. History Rte 293 adjacent the West Point golf course. During 1962 the mountain became the topic of an environmental controversy when local activists formed the Scenic Hudson Preservation Coalition (known presently simply as Scenic Hudson) to fight plans by utility Consolidated Edison to cut away part of the mountain near the river and build a pumped storage hydro-electric plant complete with transmission lines across the Hudson River for an ambitious power generating scheme which would also have entailed creating a reservoir in much of what is now Black Rock Forest. In a lawsuit brought by the coalition, Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, a judge ruled for the first time that environmentalists had standing to challenge executive branch decisions in federal court. During 1979 Con Edison finally abandoned even a greatly reduced version of the project, and settled another lawsuit against their Indian Point facility by agreeing to regulate the operation of their Hudson River power plants so as to minimize the number of fish they killed and endow the Hudson River Foundation with $12 million. After forest fires on the mountain during the dry summer of 1999, unexploded ordnance remaining from 19th century artillery tests and training at the nearby United States Military Academy was discovered in some areas close to the trails. As a result, hiking on the mountain was prohibited until October 2002, when authorities could be sure it had been removed safely. On February 20, 2011, a NYPD helicopter rescued two Fourth Class \\"plebes\\" from the United States Military Academy nearby, who had stranded themselves 500 feet up on the southern cliff face while rappelling, when a New York State Police chopper proved unable to complete the task. Hiking The mountain is a major part of Storm King State Park. With wide views of the river and areas surrounding, both Storm King and Butter Hill summits are popular with hikers. The orange-blazed unnamed connector trail, leading to the yellow-blazed Stillman Trail, most often accessed at a parking area on U.S. Route 9W, offers an immediate and steep climb up Butter Hill followed by a longer and more relaxing hike to the summit of Storm King. Although attempted infrequently and not permitted by the park authorities, there are documented technical rock climbing routes above the river, as well as ice climbing, when conditions are favorable.

For 52 years from 1905 until his death, Ferguson acted as the scorer and baggageman for Australia, England, West Indies, South Africa and New Zealand in 43 tours and 208 Test matches. He is often credited with two of the most revolutionary innovations in scoring. He developed the radial scoring chart, which shows the directions in which a batsman scored his runs. Originally called \\"Ferguson's charts\\", they are now popularly known as \\"wagon- wheels\\". He was one of the first scorers to use a linear system of scoring which, unlike the conventional system, keeps track of the balls faced by a batsman and off a particular bowler. In order to record such details, including the times of significant events during an innings, he designed his own scoring books – \\"which contain[ed] at least twice as much information as any other in the world\\" – and had them printed at his own expense. At the same time he also filled in a conventional scoring book for official use. He retained his own scoring books.Bill Ferguson, Mr Cricket, Nicholas Kaye, London, 1957, p. 56.

Shaw himself was born in Dublin, yet this is one of only two plays of his where he thematically returned to his homeland, the other being O'Flaherty V.C. The play was highly successful in its day, but is rarely revived, probably because so much of the dialogue is specific to the politics of the day. Characters *Tom Broadbent *Larry Doyle *Tim Haffigan *Hodson *Peter Keegan *Patsey Farrell *Father Dempsey *Corney Doyle *Barney Doran *Matthew Haffigan *Aunty Judy *Nora Reilly Plot The play deals with Larry Doyle, originally from Ireland, but who has turned his back on his heritage to fit in with the English and Tom Broadbent, his English (and very Machiavellian) business partner. They are civil engineers who run a firm in London. They go to Roscullen, where Doyle was born, to develop some land. Doyle has no illusions about Ireland while Broadbent is taken with the romance of the place. Broadbent, a lively man who is seemingly not always aware of the impression he makes, becomes a favourite of the people. Before the play is over, it is clear he will marry Nora Reilly, the woman waiting for Doyle (who is more than happy to let her go) and become the area's candidate for Parliament after Doyle refuses to stand. Doyle has also 'called in' all his loans given \\"so easily\\" to the locals against their homes and intends (as he had planned all along) to make the village into an amusement park. Another major character is the defrocked priest Peter (Father) Keegan, the political and temperamental opposite of Broadbent, who sees through him from the beginning and warns the locals against him. Productions The play was commissioned by W. B. Yeats for the opening of Dublin's Abbey Theatre, but Yeats rejected it as too long and too difficult to produce. He claimed that no actors were available who could do justice to the part of Broadbent. Peter Kavanagh suggests that Yeats' real reason was dislike of Shaw's style of playwriting: \\"at this time Yeats and Synge did not feel that Shaw belonged to the real Irish tradition. His plays would thus have no place in the Irish theatre movement. John Bull's Other Island was a play about Ireland but not of it. Furthermore, Shaw's plays were mostly argument, and Yeats particularly detested this quality in dramatic writing.\\"Peter Kavanagh, The Story of the Abbey Theatre: From Its Origins in 1899 to the Present, Devin-Adair, New York, 1950, p. 55. Shaw himself commented the play was written at the request of \\"Mr William Butler Yeats as a patriotic contribution to the Repertory of the Irish Literary Theatre. Like most people who have asked me to write plays Mr Yeats got rather more than he bargained for ... It was uncongenial to the whole spirit of the neo-Gaelic movement, which is bent on creating a new Ireland after its own ideal, whereas my play is a very uncompromising presentment of the real old Ireland.\\"Violet M. Broad & C. Lewis Broad, Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw, A. & C. Black, London, 1929, p. 53 The play premiered in London at the Royal Court Theatre on November 1, 1904, under the Vedrenne-Barker management. Due to its length, Barker, with Shaw's consent but not approval, cut the play somewhat. The role of Tom Broadbent was created by Louis Calvert. Dealing with the Irish question of the time, the play was seen by many major British political figures.T. F. Evans, George Bernard Shaw, Routledge, 2013, p. 7. A command performance was given for King Edward VII. He laughed so hard he broke his chair. This incident was widely reported and-- after more than a decade of playwriting--Shaw's name was made in London. It was a great success and the Court would go on to produce many other Shaw plays, both old and new. In the words of T. F. Evans, \\"the age of Bernard Shaw may be said to have begun\\". Political contexts As popular as the play was originally, it is not one of Shaw's more revived pieces. Liz Kennedy reviewing a revival in 2004, during the New Labour government of Tony Blair, argued that the play was still relevant: \\"Shaw's vision from one hundred years ago was a far-seeing one...The drama has especial contemporary resonance in this continued period of political vacuum on our own shores\\" She particularly praised \\"Alan Cox, giving an appropriately mannered Blairite performance as Broadbent the Englishman...he might historically be a Liberal, but he sounded very New Labour.\\"\\"Political Drama Set around the Emerald Isle\\", The News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland), 23 September, 2004, p.28.

The species is the only Australian bat that preys on large vertebrates – birds, reptiles and other mammals – which they detect using acute sight and hearing, combined with echolocation, while waiting in ambush at a perch. The wing membrane and bare skin is pale in colour, their fur is light or dark grey over the back and paler at the front. The species has a prominent and simple nose-leaf, their large ears are elongated and joined at lower half, and the eyes are also large and dark in colour. The first description of the species was published in 1880, its recorded range has significantly contracted since that time. Taxonomy A species of Macroderma, one of several genera in the family Megadermatidae (false vampires). The family all have large eyes, a nose-leaf and tragus, long ears joined at the base, and are also found in southern Asia and central Africa. The description was published in 1880 by George Dobson, emerging from an examination of specimens held by the Göttingen Museum. The author compared his specimen to taxa named as species of Megaderma, identifying species Megaderma spasma (lesser false vampire bat) as the closest in resemblance. A revision of bat genera by Gerrit Smith Miller reassigned the species to a new genus Macroderma, creating the current generic combination. The name Macroderma gigas combines the Greek words macros (large) and derma (skin), due to the large size of their partially conjoined ears (Richards, 2012). The epithet gigas (giant) denotes it as the largest species in the family (Hudson, 1986). The species M. gigas is placed with the Megadermatidae. An arrangement separating a \\"Pilbara district\\" population as subspecies Macroderma gigas saturata is noted as synonymous with this species concept (MSW 3rd ed., 2005). The specimen had previously been described by Gerard Krefft in a communication to the Zoological Society of London, and had been forwarded to the Göttingen museum by Dr. Schuette. The description and illustration were presented to the society in 1879, accompanied by the suggestion that it was an unnamed genus of Phyllostomatidae (New World leaf-nosed bats); a member of the society, Edward Richard Alston, proposed instead it was a species of Megaderma which were unknown in Australia. The type locality is at the Wilson River near Mt Margaret in Queensland, where the collector, also named Wilson, obtained the bat. An earlier observation had been noted by Robert Austin in 1854 at Mount Kenneth while surveying the inland regions of Western Australia. Studies of brain structures indicate that Macroderma gigas is an intermediate and divergent species of the insectivorous microchiropterans and the carnivorous species from South America. Common names that refer to Macroderma gigas have included ghost bat, false vampire, false vampire bat, and Australian false vampire bat. The name ghost bat derives from its distinct colouring, the predominant colour of its fur may be near white or pale grey. Description A larger species of microchiropterans (microbats) and the largest in Australia, the size is comparable the megabat species (flying fox, fruitbat). The fur colour is grey, ranging in tone from mid, sometimes dark, to very pale grey at the back and whitish at the ventral side and head, The colour of populations is a geographic cline, becoming darker toward the coastal regions. A ring at the eye is dark. and colour of the wing membranes and other bare skin is pale and brownish. The interfemoral membrane extends the wing surface between the length of the legs. The great length of the ear, from notch at head to tip, is 44 to 56 millimetres and they are fluted in form; the inner margins of the ears are fused for half their length. The length of the prominent ears is twice that of the head, a seam at the inner margins stiffens these to keep them upright while in flight. Other measurements of the species are a 96 to 112 mm range for the forearm length, 98 to 120 mm for the combined length of the head and body, and a weight range of 75 to 145 grams, averaging as 105 g across the sampled specimens. Illustration accompanying the first description, R. Mintern 1880 The eyes are comparatively large and well developed for nocturnal vision, a feature shared with the long-eared genera Nyctophilus. The nose-leaf is also large and prominent, and simple in form. The nasal appendage is presumably similar in usage to the elaborate forms of the horse-shoe and leaf-nosed bat genera, manipulating, directing and receiving echolocation signals to detect prey. The lack of a tail, effectively absent, is a characteristic of the species. The membrane at the rear is, however, supported by a calcar at the ankle. The teeth and short robust jaw allow the consumption of a wide variety of animals, either the flesh and bones of other vertebrate species or hard shells of larger invertebrates. A pregnant bat possesses two sets of teats, one pair beneath the armpits provide milk from the mammary glands and another pair at the pubic area. The pubic teats do not have a lactational function, rather they act as purchase points for the new-born to be carried in flight by the mother. The voice is audible to humans, one sound resembles the avian species Petrochelidon ariel (fairy martin) and transliterated as 'dirrup dirrup'. This twittering call is given when the bat is excited or before leaving the roost to feed. A chirp uttered by the species resembles crickets. The species is generally quiet, but some vocalisation is known in captivity when a squealing sound accompanies a squabble over food. The twittering sound was reported in captivity as hunger, and young will continually emit a chirp when the mother is absent. Behaviour and diet Although Macroderma gigas is inactive during daylight hours, they do not hibernate. The colony size reduces in the austral winter, increasing when they gather to breed or females form maternity groups. They leave the roost several hours after sunset, alone, in pairs, or as small groups. Hunting occurs via a 'sit and wait' technique while suspended from a tree or as low surveys over vegetation. The large ears allow the bat to hear prey moving on the ground. Field observations at Pine Creek using nightscope equipment reported seeing M. gigas suspended from a tree and dropping to catch large locusts detected moving through grass at ten to twenty metres distance. They are also able to detect the echolocation signals of the microbats on which they prey. The bat has good vision for a microchiropteran, and echolocation is also utilised to directly locate approaching prey. They are able to visually locate birds roosting in trees, and budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) are detected by their silhouettes against the evening light. The budgie is a favoured food of the bat, which they detect by the flock's chatter while retiring for the night, and these are taken to a perch to be consumed head first; the feet and wing parts are discarded while butchering the bird. Prey may be taken at or to the ground, where it is enveloped with the wings and killed with bites to the neck. The sharp teeth and strong jaws are able to subdue animals as large as the bar-shouldered dove, species Geopelia humeralis, that may weigh as much as 150 grams, although most prey is smaller. Bird and mammal remains are most frequently recorded in their scats. Once located, an animal is held down via the thumb claws and killed by a single bite to the neck. The prey is killed at the ground or in flight, and taken to a perch to be consumed, feeding may be at an overhanging rock or smaller cave for this purpose. The family Megadermatidae is carnivorous, feeding on animals that includes vertebrate species, and this species commonly feeds on arthropod, mammalian, amphibian and reptilian prey. These include large insects and small mice, other bats, small birds, frogs, Pygopodidae (legless lizards), geckos and snakes. Macroderma gigas is formally referred to as a specialised carnivore, but they have been known to feed on insects if prey is scarce. Vertebrate prey is eaten much more frequently, and is usually consumed at the site of capture. Other species of microbats are taken in flight, these include species of sheathtails, bentwings or horseshoe bats and little cave eptesicus. A study of the avian prey of the bat revealed that over fifty species of birds are targeted, in a range of sizes but a preference for those weighing less than 35 grams. Birds that roost in flocks make up a large part of the diet, and a quarter of the species are non-passerines. One nocturnal species of bird is recorded at their middens, the Australian owlet-nightjar Aegotheles cristatus. The examination of the butchered remains of their middens has given support to interpretation of fossil depositions, that have similar assemblages of discarded remains, at the Riversleigh formations where this and other species of Macroderma are exceptionally well represented. Field workers report that the species is remarkably passive when handled. Other workers have recorded and confirmed reports of Macroderma gigas preying on rodents caught in their pitfall traps.  Distribution and habitat  anterior view of ghost bat under sedation The ghost bat is endemic to Australia. Three population centres are identified, the Northern Pilbara and Kimberley in Western Australia, the Top End of the continent and in Queensland. The distribution of colonies is non-contiguous, and they usually occur in small isolated pockets within each region. Analysis of fossil remains shows that distribution patterns within Australia changed, in waves of both expansion and contraction, and the probable cause was ecological changes resulting from the increasing aridity of the continent's climate. Little is known of the genetics of the ghost bat, although research into population indicates is highly structured. The colonies shows a high degree of genetic distinctiveness at a local and regional level. The southernmost record is Austin's 1854 note at Mt Kenneth. A limestone cave site favoured by M. gigas is in the region of the Mitchell and Palmer rivers at Cape York. They are occur around Shoalwater Bay at the east coast. The species is well represented at Litchfield National Park, which provides important caves and habitat for a number of bat species in the northern regions near Darwin. The largest recorded breeding colony of M. gigas is at a gold mine named Kohinoor at the Top End. The mine was dug in the late nineteenth century and later occupied as a creche when it became unprofitable, however, it remains on a lease that may be profitable as an open-cut operation. Another well known breeding site is found at Nourlangie Rock in Kakadu National Park, a region that is protected by conservation. It is also recorded in national parks at Mount Etna Caves NP and at Tunnel Creek where they cohabit with other bat species. Small colonies have been recorded along the Victoria River and at Camooweal Caves NP. The range extends in association with rocky cliffs, gorges, or outcrops along watercourses in the Kimberley region of northwest Australia. Built environments may be used as feeding grounds, but the ghost bat selects daytime roosts in caves, sheltered rock crevices, boulder piles or disused mines; occupation of abandoned buildings is only occasionally reported. A preference is given to sites with a complex of shafts or cavities and several openings to the outside. Macroderma gigas favours these caves with multiple entrance ways as they are large enough to accommodate the greater wingspan of the species and allow an alternative exit when sensing a threat. They require several suitable sites for rest, feeding and reproduction, and change locations seasonally. The species is especially sensitive to disturbance by humans, and this contributes to the selection or abandonment of a roost site. The bat and the caves they occupied were well known to peoples of Australia, often informing field workers of their locations in central Australia; some sites were part of 'men's business' that imparted a story of the being to young initiates. Macroderma gigas is present in the fossil record of Australia and found at the Riversleigh World Heritage Area. The species was sympatric with others of the genus at Riversleigh. such as Macroderma malugara, and is the modern representative of a lineage that extends to at least the early Miocene epoch. Range decline Captives at Alice Springs Desert Park, located in the bats earlier range The ghost bat was once widely distributed throughout Australia, and became restricted to a sparser population across northern regions. The species was recorded three more times in the twenty years that followed its discovery, two at Alice Springs and one in the Pilbrara. Attempts to survey the distribution range began in 1961, when its earlier status as a relict and rare species was revised to indicate it was more widespread and disappearing in regions where it was known within living memory; Hedley Finlayson interviewed Pitjanjarra elders (Anangu people) who knew of the species in the Musgrave, Mann and Tomkinson Ranges and not seen for forty years. The species had been observed across the central regions of Australia, and the desiccated remains have been found on cave floors in the Flinders Ranges. The skeletons have also been recorded in caves of the coast in the southwest of Australia. The range is now limited to regions near the coast and north of the Tropic of Capricorn. Researchers have noted the lack evidence for the species in former range, and the contraction to the north both before and after European settlement has been investigated. There are isolated congregations of bats in specified maternity sites in which the alleles expressed by the females are distinguishable; this implies that the separation of such populations extends through evolutionary time. This scattering into small sets of populations greatly raises the threat of extinction to the species. It is estimated that several thousand ghost bats remain in existence today. Declines in population are expected to be reversed in part because of increased survival rates, not because of immigration from other isolated areas. There are very few national parks that strive to protect the species at this time. The decline has been correlated to the increasing range of the amphibian species Rhinella marina (Bufo marinus), known locally as the cane toad. Investigations of recorded sites found the bat absent when the toad reached their local habitat, combined with the evidence of occasional consumption and—in one example—found in the throat of a deceased bat, the advance of the cane toad is strongly implicated as the cause of their rapid decline. Reproduction During the breeding season, late October to early November, female bats congregate in groups and give birth to a single young. The generation length is estimated at four years. According to a study conducted on range of ghost bats in Australia, “female bats gave birth to a single young in late spring, but only 40% of females bred in their second year, increasing to 93% for females greater than 2 years old”. Maternity colonies are founded in large and open caves and occupied until the young are reared. The teats are evident in females during the maternity season. The possession of anterior teats allows the new born to cling to the mother until the milk teeth are shed. The young are born in the austral spring, are able to fly after seven weeks, and become fully weaned at sixteen weeks. As is the norm for microbats, only one young is produced by the mother. The males play no part in the rearing of young. The juvenile hunts with the mother until reaching an independent stage of its maturity.  Ecology  The associated species include the black flying fox Pteropus alecto, recorded at Tunnel Creek in the Kimberley. A new species of parasite, the tick Argas macrodermae, was discovered on specimens of M. gigas, but as a microchiropteran is remarkably free of external parasitic organisms. The only record as host to an endoparasite is the filarial nematode species Josefilaria mackerrasae, described from specimens found on M. gigas in 1979. Macroderma gigas has few predators, and most competition of their nocturnal hunts is from medium-sized owls (Strigidae). They will join other predators at a cave mouth where other bat species will exit, this example of multiple species feasting together with other carnivores is intensified in the season when young bats are emerging from their creche. These congregations include introduced species, cane toad Rhinella marina, feral cats and foxes, and natives such as pythons, birds of prey, quolls and large frogs of genus Litoria. The bat will often take prey to a feeding roost, where a midden is formed from the discarded remains. The range of a species of skink, found in the Northern Territory, was extended to Queensland by a record at a feeding roost of M. gigas. Captive under artificial light Perth Zoo The species is vulnerable to several anthropogenic hazards, one is barbed wire fencing that accounts for many deaths when they are snagged through the easily torn wing membrane while in flight. The damage caused by the barbed wire strands, often left littering their environment, is greatly increased as the individual become entangled as it attempts to dislodge itself. A study in the Pilbara region identified this as an especial concern, with indications that barbed wire was significantly impacting local populations when erected. The foraging height of M. gigas is around that of the dominant Triodia (spinifex) vegetation and the species is unable to visually detect the wire strand, and is not thought to use echolocation to forage in flight. The thorny and tangled introduced plant lantana also presents a similar hazard to bats. They are especially sensitive to disturbance in wintering roosts, and a single fleeting visit will see the site deserted for several weeks or altogether if human activity continues. Most bat species are vulnerable to human disturbance, but attempts to view M. gigas at their roosts are especially discouraged due to the rapid decline in range and population. New or reopened mining operations may have an impact on local colonies, although they may provide diurnal roosts when complete; they are vulnerable to dilapidation in former mines such as the collapse of ceilings. The conservation status of Macroderma gigas includes listings of state or federal authorities and non-governmental organisations. The Queensland and South Australian state registers note the species as endangered and in Western Australia it is classified as vulnerable to threatening factors. The federal classification is vulnerable under the EPBC act 1999. Despite a well documented decline, the relevant criteria of legislation was not found to support a relisting of their status as endangered without analysis of genetic variation in the population. The relevant non statuary bodies, IUCN and The action plan for Australian mammals (2012), also list this species as vulnerable to extinction. The population estimate at the IUCN Red List (2019) is between four and six thousand mature individuals in total. The state population of Queensland is less than one thousand, and the large colony at Mt Etna has gone into decline. The Kohinoor maternity colony at the Top End is stable but vulnerable to mine collapse. The western populations are more numerous in the Kimberley, three to four thousand, and the Pilbara group is estimated at less than six hundred.

Originally designating a single permanent marker, the Sharpie brand has been widely expanded and can now be found on a variety of previously unrelated permanent and non-permanent pens and markers formerly marketed under other brands. This article focuses on the legacy Sharpie permanent marker line. Sharpie markers are made with several tips. The most common and popular is the Fine tip. Other tips include Ultra Fine Point, Extra Fine Point, Brush tip, Chisel tip, and Retractable tip. Apart from markers and highlighters, Sharpie products include gel and rollerball pens.  History  \\"Sharpie\\" was originally a name designating a permanent marker launched in 1964 by the Sanford Ink Company (established in 1857). The Sharpie also became the first pen-style permanent marker. In 1990, Sharpie was acquired by The Newell Companies (later Newell Rubbermaid) as part of Sanford, a leading manufacturer and marketer of writing instruments. In 2005, the company's popular Accent highlighter brand was repositioned under the Sharpie brand name. A new version of Sharpie called Sharpie Mini was launched, which are markers half the size of a normal Sharpie and feature a clip to attach the Sharpie to a keychain or lanyard. In 2006, Sharpie released a new line of markers that had a button- activated retractable tip rather than a cap. Sharpie Paint markers were also introduced. As of 2011, 200 million Sharpies had been sold worldwide. Sharpie markers are manufactured in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico and Maryville, TN, and with numerous off-shore partners globally.  Marketing  Sharpie sponsored the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Sharpie 500, a popular night-time race at Bristol Motor Speedway, from 2001 through 2009. For the 2010 season, Newell Rubbermaid switched the sponsorship for this race to its Irwin Tools brand. Sharpie sponsored the Nationwide Series Sharpie Mini 300 race from 2004 to 2008. Before 2006, they sponsored Kurt Busch, who was the 2004 Sprint Cup champion. Sharpie also sponsored Jamie McMurray in the 2006 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and the 2008 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. In recent years, Sharpie commercials have followed the slogan \\"Write Out Loud\\". These advertisements depict people using Sharpies in bad situations, such as using the marker to touch up a car and a college woman highlighting words in a book to notify a male student that his fly was open. Also, a middle-aged woman trying to think of what to write for her resignation letter, writes \\"I QUIT\\" with a red Sharpie. David Beckham is sponsored by Sharpie and appears in a commercial signing autograph with a Sharpie and trying to steal them.  Product features  Hand sanitizer and acetone based nail polish remover are said to be effective on permanent markers. Sharpie official FAQ suggests trying a product called Amodex stain remover. Though Sharpie ink will become mostly permanent after setting, it can be erased. A dry erase marker is usually successful in removing sharpie ink by covering the sharpie ink using three to four pen strokes. Sharpie ink that has dried for more than several hours can be removed with acetone and other ketones and esters, such as ethyl acetate, but acetone and other organic solvents may damage the surface of the material written upon. Isopropyl alcohol works well and is less damaging to some surfaces; rubbing alcohol is the dilute form, so it works more slowly. On some surfaces, the ink can be removed by coloring over the ink with a dry erase marker (since this marker's ink contains organic solvents) and then removing the Sharpie ink and dry erase marker ink with a dry cloth. Steam cleaning has proved effective, as have rubber erasers. Magic Eraser has also proven somewhat effective on hard surfaces such as brick and very effective on wood furniture. On non-porous surfaces, denatured alcohol is the most effective solvent for the removal of Sharpie ink, and it is safe for use on most plastics. There are no warning labels on Sharpie markers. They bear the new AP (Approved Product) certification symbol of The Art & Creative Materials Institute, Inc. (ACMI). According to the organization: > \\"The new AP (Approved Product) Seal, with or without Performance > Certification, identifies art materials that are safe and that are certified > in a toxicological evaluation by a medical expert to contain no materials in > sufficient quantities to be toxic or injurious to humans, including > children, or to cause acute or chronic health problems. (Sanford LP became a > member of ACMI in 1986) However, this does not mean that materials are not > irritants or allergens. Such products are certified by ACMI to be labeled by > the chronic hazard labeling standard, ASTM D 4236, and the U.S. Labeling of > Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA).\\" They are considered non-toxic for \\"normal uses\\", meaning writing on posters, soccer balls and such. Sharpie is not meant for the skin but is not dangerous with incidental exposure.  In popular culture  Actress Lyndsey Fonseca handling a Sharpie at the 2010 Toronto Film Festival During an October 14, 2002 National Football League Monday Night Football game against the Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens pulled a black Sharpie marker out of his sock to sign the football he caught to score a touchdown and then gave the ball to his financial adviser, who was in the stands. The touchdown celebration would bring a resurgence to the NFL for new and innovative ways to celebrate touchdowns. It has commonly been referred to by sports fans as \\"The Sharpie Incident\\" or \\"The Sharpie Touchdown\\". Special Camp David Sharpies were made for United States President George W. Bush, who has long been loyal to the brand. (archived 2013) Sharpie markers are favored by illustrator Adam Hughes for inking large areas in his convention sketches. May 15, 2006; Accessed September 8, 2010 May 15, 2006; Accessed September 8, 2010 Sharpies are the writing utensil of choice by astronauts aboard the International Space Station because of their usability in zero-gravity. According to Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who commanded the International Space Station in 2012–2013, \\"you can hold it any which way and it still works\\". United States President Donald Trump has a well-known preference for using Sharpies to sign official government documents. In September 2019, Trump was involved in a \\"Sharpie-gate\\" controversy, in which - as CNN reports: \\"Trump defended an apparent Sharpie-altered map of Hurricane Dorian's predicted path.\\" CNN's Brian Stelter gets to the bottom of President Donald Trump's \\"Sharpie-gate\\" controversy, in which Trump defended an apparent Sharpie-altered map of Hurricane Dorian's predicted path.

Born in the western Ethiopian city of Jimma, Mulatu was musically trained in London, New York City, and Boston where he combined his jazz and Latin music interests with traditional Ethiopian music. Astatke led his band while playing vibraphone and conga drums—instruments that he introduced into Ethiopian popular music—as well as other percussion instruments, keyboards, and organ. His albums focus primarily on instrumental music, and Mulatu appears on all three known albums of instrumentals that were released during Ethiopian Golden 1970s. Biography =Early life= Mulatu in 2005 at the WSIS Mulatu's family sent the young Mulatu to learn engineering in Wales during the late 1950s. Instead, he began his education at Lindisfarne College near Wrexham before earning a degree in music through studies at the Trinity College of Music in London. He collaborated with jazz vocalist and percussionist Frank Holder. In the 1960s, Mulatu moved to the United States to enroll at Berklee College of Music in Boston. He studied vibraphone and percussion. While living in the U.S., Mulatu became interested in Latin jazz and recorded his first two albums, Afro-Latin Soul, Volumes 1 & 2, in New York City in 1966. The records prominently feature Mulatu's vibraphone, backed by piano and congas playing Latin rhythms, and were entirely instrumental with the exception of the song \\"I Faram Gami I Faram,\\" which was sung in Spanish. In the early 1970s, Mulatu brought his new sound, which he called Ethio-jazz, back to his homeland while continuing to work in the U.S. He collaborated with many notable artists in both countries, arranging and playing on recordings by Mahmoud Ahmed, and appearing as a special guest with Duke Ellington and his band during a tour of Ethiopia in 1973.Ethio-Jazz: Mulatu Astatke, referenced September 2010. Mulatu recorded Mulatu of Ethiopia (1972) in New York City, but most of his music was released by Amha Eshete's label Amha Records in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, including several singles, his album Yekatit Ethio Jazz (1974), and six out of the ten tracks on the compilation album Ethiopian Modern Instrumentals Hits. Yekatit Ethio Jazz combined traditional Ethiopian music with American jazz, funk, and soul. By 1975, Amha Records had ceased production after the Derg military junta forced the label's owner to flee the country. Mulatu remained to play vibes for Hailu Mergia and the Walias Band's 1977 album Tche Belew (which included \\"Musicawi Silt\\") before the Walias also left Ethiopia to tour internationally. By the 1980s, Mulatu's music was largely forgotten outside of his homeland. =Recent works= Mulatu Astatke on stage with the Heliocentrics in Rome, Italy, 2009 In the early 1990s, many record collectors rediscovered the music of Mulatu Astatke and were combing stashes of vinyl for copies of his 70s releases. In 1998, the Parisian record label Buda Musique began to reissue many of the Amha-era Ethio-jazz recordings on compact disc as part of the series Éthiopiques, and the first of these reissues to be dedicated to a single musician was Éthiopiques Volume 4: Ethio Jazz & Musique Instrumentale, 1969–1974. The album brought Mulatu's music to an international audience.Mulatu Astatke: the Man and His Influence, referenced September 2010. Mulatu's music has had an influence on other musicians from the Horn region, such as K'naan. His Western audience increased when the film Broken Flowers (2005) directed by Jim Jarmusch featured seven of his songs, including one performed by Cambodian-American rock band Dengue Fever. National Public Radio used his instrumentals as beds under or between pieces, notably on the program This American Life. Samples of his were used by Nas, Damian Marley, Kanye West, Cut Chemist, Quantic, Madlib, and Oddisee. After meeting the Massachusetts-based Either/Orchestra in Addis Ababa in 2004, Mulatu began a collaboration with the band beginning with performances in Scandinavia in summer 2006 and London, New York, Germany, Holland, Glastonbury (UK), Dublin, and Toronto in 2008. In the fall of 2008, he collaborated with the London- based collective The Heliocentrics on the album Inspiration Information Vol. 3, which included re-workings of his Ethio-jazz classics with new material by the Heliocentrics and himself. Mulatu performs with Black Jesus Experience members Chris Frangou (bass) and Liam Monkhouse (MC) in Addis Ababa in 2015. In 2008, he completed a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship at Harvard University where he worked on modernization of traditional Ethiopian instruments and premiered a portion of a new opera, The Yared Opera. He served as an Abramowitz Artist-in-Residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, giving lectures and workshops and advising MIT Media Lab on creating a modern version of the krar, a traditional Ethiopian instrument. On 1 February 2009, Mulatu performed at the Luckman Auditorium in Los Angeles with a band that included Bennie Maupin, Azar Lawrence, and Phil Ranelin. He released a two- disc compilation album to be sold exclusively to passengers of Ethiopian Airlines, with the first disc containing a compilation of styles from different regions of Ethiopia and the second consisting of studio originals. On 12 May 2012, he received an honorary doctor of music degree from the Berklee College of Music. In 2015, Mulatu began recording with Black Jesus Experience for Cradle of Humanity, which premiered at the Melbourne Jazz Festival in 2016 and was followed by a tour of Australia and New Zealand.

The original route connects Lancaster in Lancaster County with Chester in Chester County. The line's nickname is The Springmaid Line, which refers to its original purpose of connecting the plants of the Springs Mills company. History =Formation= In 1873, the Cheraw and Chester Railroad Company was granted a charter by a Special Act of the South Carolina General Assembly \\"to construct a railroad from Cheraw, in Chesterfield County, to Chesterville, in Chester County, by such route as shall be found most suitable and advantageous\\". In those days, railroads were often built in sections using different contractors and money sometimes ran out before the line was tied together. This happened to the narrow gaugeAmerican-Rails.com - Lancaster And Chester Railway, The Springmaid Line Cheraw and Chester. In 1879, it made it the from Chester County to the Catawba River but did not cross it. On the other end, rail was laid from Cheraw to Pageland before the capital was exhausted in that direction. It operated for three years in these sections before being split. The Chester section was leased to the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, which built a wooden bridge across the Catawba and extended the track beyond Lancaster in 1883. It was then leased to the Richmond and Danville Railroad, which in turn went into receivership. Meanwhile, the line from Cheraw to Pageland became the Chesterfield and Lancaster Railroad but never extended any further. The receivers for the Richmond and Danville operated the line from Lancaster to Lenoir as one railroad but neglected to pay expenses. It soon returned the Cheraw and Chester to its stockholders. =Colonel Leroy Springs= Two years later, in 1896, the railroad was sold by court order at an advertised auction for $25,000 to satisfy its debts. Its buyer, Colonel Leroy Springs, renamed the line the Lancaster and Chester Railroad and organized a company to run it. In addition to Leroy Springs, the incorporators of the new railroad were William Ganson, R. C. McManus, W. T. Gregory, L. C. Payseur, James M. Heath and W. H. Hardin. All of the men were from Lancaster save for Hardin, who was from Chester. The capital stock of the company was $50,000. On June 22, 1896, Hardin, also manager of the Chesterville and Lenoir, was elected manager and auditor of the line. Springs did not have any personal experience in the railroad business. His interest in purchasing the line may have stemmed in part from the fact that his father, Andrew Baxter Springs, had been one of the contractors and directors for the Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad, which helped form the towns of Rock Hill and Fort Mill, South Carolina. His grandfather, John Springs III, had been an early investor of the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company, the nation's first operating railroad, and had the privilege of having one of its early engines named after him in the days when engines were named instead of numbered. Springs' brother was president of the Atlantic, Tennessee and Ohio Railroad (AT&O;) that proceeded from Charlotte to Taylorsville before it ran out of capital. When he would refer to the AT&O; in front of fellow businessmen, Springs would claim to be president of the Lancaster, Klondike and Manila Western Railroad. Although the railroad business as a whole was not prosperous, the newly created L&C; did not have to look far for business. Springs had recently completed a textile mill in Lancaster to go with the mills he already owned in Chester, all of which supplied traffic to the railroad. Other businesses in both towns were also served by the L&C.; The line connected with the Southern Railway at both ends; with Carolina and Northwestern Railway (itself later part of Southern) at Chester; and with Seaboard Air Line at Fort Lawn. In 1899, both the Catawba River Trestle and Lancaster Depot burned a few months apart from one another. The cost to replace both structures nearly equaled what Springs and his associates paid for the railway three years earlier. However, this misfortune did allow the line an opportunity to upgrade by building a steel trestle to replace the original wooden one. For the first six years of its existence, the Lancaster and Chester Railroad had the distinct disadvantage of being a narrow gauge railroad. Thus, it was impossible to exchange cars with the main lines, which were . Freight had to be unloaded from the main line cars in Lancaster or Chester and reloaded onto the smaller L&C; cars and vice versa. Also, the L&C; engines had to burn wood because the coal mines were on standard gauge lines and it was not economical to reload the coal on to smaller cars. In 1902, Springs borrowed $125,000 from the Southern Railway to convert the L&C; rails to standard gauge. The railway also bought new coal burning locomotives as well as new rail cars. The East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad purchased the old rolling stock from the L&C.; By 1913, the L&C; owned three steam locomotives, nineteen box cars, two coal cars, two passenger cars, and two combines. Capital stock had risen from $50,000 to $500,000. Then as now, odd-numbered trains ran eastbound and even-numbered trains ran westbound, against traditional railroad operating procedure. This is because before Springs bought the railroad, trains ran through from points north of Chester. Thus, they started their runs as southbound trains which, like westbound trains, normally have odd-digit numbers. They kept their odd numbers all the way to Lancaster on the Chester and Cheraw, even after they turned east at Chester. Later that year, the Lancaster and Chester was persuaded to run a special passenger train to carry fans to a baseball series in Chester County between Chester and Dillon. There were as many passengers on that one train as the L&C; ordinarily carried in an entire year. To make the most of the trip, several empty coal cars were attached in front of the passenger cars. When the train reached the Hooper Creek Trestle, one of the hopper cars derailed, taking the three coaches into the creek below. Every person aboard was badly shaken or injured, and five lives were lost. The seventy-one personal injury claims totaled more than $130,000, nearly causing the L&C; to go bankrupt. Two weeks after the Hooper Creek derailment, a fire destroyed the Lancaster Depot, which also served as a warehouse for the mill, costing the railway an additional $75,000. It took Springs two years to emerge from the courthouse with his railroad intact. He then was able to borrow enough money to get the line operating again. In 1916, a hurricane-generated flood washed away the three-span Catawba River Trestle as well as the Cane Creek Trestle near the Lancaster Plant. For weeks, the L&C; detoured over the Southern line to Catawba Junction and the Seaboard line to Fort Lawn to connect with its own line. A ferry was then built to take the place of the trestle, but this proved to be both slow and expensive. A new trestle would have cost $90,000, more than the railroad was worth before the old trestle was lost. The Southern Railway was not interested in taking the railroad back and building a new trestle. For a year, the option of abandoning operations and taking up the rails to sell for scrap was considered. Springs then heard of a main-line trestle that was about to be abandoned by the railroad that owned it so they could replace it with a trestle that had double tracks. The trestle also included a bridge for automobiles. Colonel Springs bought this trestle and then sold it to the county for what he had paid for it. He was left with only the expense of moving the trestle to the Catawba and attaching it to the stone piers of the old trestle that were spared by the flood. The new trestle fit the piers of the old one. The Lancaster and Chester resumed operations just in time to be taken over by the government during World War I. =Elliott Springs= Springs died in April 1931 leaving his empire to his only child, Elliott White Springs. Elliott Springs was born just weeks after his father purchased the L&C; and had a genuine love for the railway. Under his leadership, the L&C; began to prosper in the latter part of that decade, on the eve of the Second World War. In 1939, he brought the L&C; national attention when he purchased the Loretto, a rail car that had originally been built for the former president of U.S. Steel, Charles M. Schwab. Springs carefully preserved the splendor of the forty-year-old car's Victorian design—Cuban mahogany paneling, crystal chandelier, velvet draperies, marble bath, and gold-plated beds. He had the Loretto remodeled for office use, then parked it on a siding near the White homestead in Fort Mill. , the Loretto on display at the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina. Springs had a flair for colorful advertising. One of the things he remains best remembered for is the menu he wrote and printed for the L&C; dining car. This menu included: Long Island Ugly Duckling stuffed with Turnip Greens and Pearl Onions, Cannibal Sandwich with real collar buttons, Pork Barrel stuffed with Republican, Drawn and Quartered Democrat Roasted in Own Jacket, and Elliott Springs with Garlic and Chlorophyll. Also offered were an alligator pear for one dollar and a pair of alligators for two dollars. Dessert was watermelon Jane Russell, pitted grapes and potted dates. That the L&C; did not actually own a dining car at the time did not matter. Springs rarely did anything in a small way and usually had fun doing it. It was his idea to appoint 29 vice-presidents to the railway, one for each mile of track. They included playwright Charles MacArthur, golfer Bobby Jones, artist James Montgomery Flagg, writer Lucius Beebe, radio man Lowell Thomas and his wartime friends Billy Bishop and Clayton Knight. Another one of these fictional vice- presidents was Ham Fisher, who seldom drew a freight train in his Joe Palooka strip without labeling it Lancaster and Chester. However, it was striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee, named vice-president in charge of unveiling, who got the most attention. Lee was brought to the attention of Springs by his friend, Agnew Bahnson of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was a devoted fan of the rails and kept models of famous trains in her basement. In addition to providing menus for dining cars that did not exist and the naming of the colorful vice-presidents, Springs listed a timetable for trains that likewise did not exist. They included The Shrinking Violet, The Black Label, The Purple Cow, The Red Rose, The White Horse and The Blue Blazes. When the New York, New Haven and Hartford denied Springs his request for a pass by writing that they were granted only to those lines that generated traffic for its route, he wrote back, \\"I note that the New Haven does not consider the L&C; Railway of sufficient importance to honor its officials with an annual pass. I have personally routed some two hundred carloads over the New Haven in the past three or four months but you may rest assured that I will do otherwise in the future.\\" When Springs moved into his office at the new company headquarters in Fort Mill, he found himself with a and blank space on his walls. He proposed a mural of his railroad, the Lancaster and Chester, but several aerial photographers insisted this would be impossible. In spite of this, Springs sent well-known photographer Elliott Lyman Fisher up with company pilot Cecil Neal. They flew up and down the line until Fisher had photographed every foot of track—villages, mills, woodlands and fields. When several mountings of the prints failed to satisfy Springs, Fisher colored each slide by hand. One hundred and eighty lights illuminated the slides from the rear giving them a three-dimensional effect. The mounting of the mural allowed Springs to inspect his railroad any time he wished. In 1946, the L&C; upgraded its fleet by buying six diesel locomotives from the U.S. Army. These 65-ton Whitcomb locomotives had seen service in Italy during the war and burned about the same amount of oil to run that the old steam engines used for lubrication. The purchase of these engines made the L&C; the first fully diesel-operated railroad in the state, something that Springs liked to boast of. The steam engines formerly used by the railroad were either sold or put out to pasture. However, these diesels did not spend long on the line as they were replaced by three 70-ton GEs in late 1950. Among the Whitcombs, number 51 passed to the Allegheny and South Side Railway where it would stay until the end of that property. In 1951, Gypsy Rose Lee was on hand in Lancaster to 'unveil' the new Williamsburg-style depot. Her six-year-old son, Erik, was also present and was photographed with his mother in the cab of one of the L&C;'s locomotives. In addition, Springs gave the L&C; its slogan, \\"The Springmaid Line\\". He also outfitted a Rolls-Royce as a high rail inspection vehicle. In the late 1950s, the Railway adopted a light blue, gray and white paint scheme to replace the dark blue and white scheme of earlier diesels. =H.W. Close= Elliott Springs died in 1959 and his son in-law, H.W. Close, became president of Springs and the L&C.; In 1961, a steel shop and engine house was built in Lancaster to replace the wood structure that was currently in use. In late 1965, the GE diesels were replaced by two new EMD SW900s. They were given the numbers 90 and 91 and are still in use by the Railway on a regular basis in late 2001. These locomotives handled the traffic on the line—much of the time making two freight runs a day—until December, 1984, when an additional EMD SW900 was added to the fleet and given the number 92. In 1996, two EMD SW1500's, numbered 95 and 96, were added, followed by four EMD SW1200s in 1998, which were numbered 93, 94, 97 and 98. In 2001, the line leased two more ex-Conrails units from Locomotive Leasing Partners, or LLPX, SW1500 #215 and SW1001 #91. Recent events The L&C; added another aspect to its operation in 1996 when Bob Willetts began a passenger car restoration program in Lancaster. The J.P. Henderson car was the first to come out of Lancaster. It is currently in charter service on Amtrak. In the late 1970s, this car had been in storage in New York and a state of disrepair. It was bought, then moved to Hartsville, South Carolina where a total renovation began. It went back into service in 1989 and was later bought by the Lancaster and Chester. In 2006, the South Carolina shortline got some national railroad attention again in Pennsylvania. The New Hope and Ivyland Railroad restored their Baldwin steam engine 2-8-0 #40 to her original appearance as a 1920s-era freight locomotive when she worked for the Lancaster and Chester. When the L&C; went diesel in 1947, the steamer went to the Cliffside Railroad in North Carolina. Due to the conversion from steam to diesel motive power on the Cliffside, the #40 was sold in 1962. Steam Trains Inc., a Pennsylvanian group of investors, bought the 2-8-0 and had it shipped to the Reading roundhouse in Wilmington, Delaware. By 1966, the equipment was again transferred to New Hope, Pennsylvania where the locomotive operates to this day. However, it is now again lettered for the NH&I.; On March 25, 2001, the L&C; entered into a lease-purchase agreement with Norfolk Southern to operate the SB trackage in Lancaster County. It is the first expansion in route mileage since the inception of the L&C; more than one hundred years ago. On September 2, 2010, Gulf and Ohio Railways announced it was purchasing the Lancaster and Chester; the deal was planned to be completed by November 2010. A look ahead for the L&C; In 2001, the Lancaster and Chester entered into a lease-purchase agreement with Norfolk Southern to operate the former SB line in Lancaster County. This extends from MP 89.5 near the Catawba River to MP 58.7 in Kershaw, a total of . This ended years of negotiation between the two lines. Until then the Lancaster and Chester Railroad had virtually the same route- mileage since its inception in 1896. It passes over nine wooden trestles ranging in length from long Catawba River Trestle is a combination structure made of wooden trestle segments and four steel though trusses. Along the line lies 66 curves, the sharpest of which is 5 degrees 30 minutes. The steepest grade is a mile and half stretch west of Richburg called, appropriately enough, Richburg Hill. At 4.7%, it is said to be among the steepest in the Southeast. (This might even be more true now that NS stopped rolling trains over Saluda.) The Railway invested heavily in its own line in the late 1990s, spending close to nine million dollars over a three- to five-year period. New rail was laid replacing 85 to 95 pound per yard (42–47 kg/m) rail with 127-132 lb/yd (63–66 kg/m) rail. Most of it is stick rail, through some welded sections were added on crossings and curves to simplify maintenance. In addition, the railroad tripled their locomotive fleet in that time period going from three units in 1996 to a total of nine by the end of the decade. Bridges were also strengthened. This allowed the Railway to begin using cars instead of the cars previously used. In time, the L&C; plans to use cars. There are now two interchanges on the line. One is with Norfolk Southern in Chester on their Charlotte to Columbia main. Traffic to and from the interchange on the NS end is handled daily with their local out of Rock Hill. The power on these locals are generally GP59s or high hood GP38-2s. NS Transcaer GP59 #4611 and Operation Lifesaver #4640 was power for most of October, 2001. An interchange with CSX-predecessor Seaboard Coast Line (and before that Seaboard Air Line) was built in 1981 in East Chester to replace the SCL interchange in Fort Lawn that was abandoned at the same time. Power on these trains can be anything from GP40s to wide noses—even LMSX #710 once or twice—to ex-Con B36-7s. The lease agreement with Norfolk Southern effectively takes away the Lancaster interchange which had not been used in many years. Most of the L&C;'s traffic on the Original 29 is on the Chester end of the line and the car-hire charge was reduced if all interchange was handled there. There was a time when the L&C;'s parent company was responsible for up to 90% of the traffic on the line, up to 13,000 cars annually at the six plants on the line. (The L&C; also switched out the Eureka Plant in Chester. To get there, they had to cross Seaboard at grade while using the Southern Columbia to Charlotte main. The last time I saw this happen was in 1989.) However, when Springs bought another company, a truck fleet came with it. The trucking side soon became more dominant and Springs-generated rail traffic dwindled from a couple of thousand cars of textile-related material annually to roughly one hundred cars a year at the Lancaster Complex in the early 2000s. That plant was closed in 2003 and soon torn down to make way for a park. The hundred cars that came out of that plant in later years was bales of corrugated cardboard which was taken a few miles up track to Bowers Fibers. When Springs stopped shipping there by rail, Bowers Fibers stopped receiving by rail. Springs-owned Grace Water Treatment Plant uses about 1,400 cars of coal a year. In terms of revenue, this was for many years the largest business served by the L&C.; In the late 1970s, the railroad, sensing that Springs-generated traffic would soon dwindle, created a industrial park In Richburg near I-77. Formerly known as Carolina's Distribution Park, since renamed The L&C; Railway Distribution Park, this area includes Guardian Industries, Porter-Warner and Thyssen Steel, which was the first industry to move there. Thyssen, which recently opened a second plant on the line, takes inbound coils of sheet steel and slits them for various industries, such as stampings for automobiles, lawn mowers and refrigerators. The Lancaster and Chester handles up to 2,400 carloads of sand and chemicals to park tenant Guardian Glass a year. Also, the Railway bought four gondolas for Guardian to ship cullet to the Richburg plant from Florida. (However, these gondolas, numbered 300 to 303, are in storage on line. Two of them are in Fort Lawn on the spur that once led to the cotton warehouses.) The Railway owns more than of land near I-77 in Richburg and hopes to attract other businesses to the area. But not at any cost. A Charlotte, North Carolina company was recently looking to build along the line. However, research into the company's past revealed a number of environmental citations. As a result of this finding, the Lancaster and Chester decided not to sell to this company. For volume of cars, the largest customer on the line was at one time GAF at a section of track in East Chester near the CSX interchange. GAF has stopped shipping as much by rail. Archer-Daniels-Midland in Kershaw is currently the biggest customer on the line with estimates ranging up to 4,000 cars a year. Circle S at MM17 on the Original 29 handles some 3,500 cars a year. Furthermore, there is a shuffle train between the two feed mills. This was billed as an added bonus to L&C; operation of the SB. Formerly, 18-wheelers, up to 60 a week, handled this traffic. The L&C; owns a fleet of boxcars— cars built in 1979, cars built in 1996—that were used primarily by GAF, which manufactures rolled roofing-mat material. The 50 footers once numbered forty in total and were in the 200 to 239 block. Five were lost in a derailment in Arkansas while ten were sold to Lexington & Ohio Railroad in 2000. The 60 footers are numbered 600 to 619. For a time, fifteen of these had been leased by CSX. I believe those have since been returned to service by L&C.; PPG Industries is also in East Chester. PPG manufactures 70 million pounds (32,000 metric tons) of fiber material annually that is used in such diverse products as computers and surfboards. Speciality Polymers, Union Carbide and Owens-Corning are also near the wye at East Chester. Once every week to ten days, the L&C; gets unit trains from Ohio for the Circle S Feed Mill now at Milepost 17 between Fort Lawn and Richburg. Both Norfolk Southern and CSX were vying for Circle S. But the L&C; convinced the owner of the plant to locate on the L&C; by making him see that, according to Steve Gedney, president of the L&C;, 'he could have the best of both worlds here,' a reference to being able to choose the best rate between both Class 1 carriers that the L&C; connects with. It was this business, along with the 4.7 percent grade at Richburg Hill, that prompted the Railway to purchase four ex-Conrail EMD SW1200s which arrived in 1998. One of these 1200s, 97, spent most of the first three years it was on the line at Circle S unloading the grain cars. As of early November, 2001, it had been replaced by LLPX SW1001 #91. When the SW1001 was returned to LLPX, the railroad put their SW900 #91 at the grain mill. In all, the Railway handles about 14,000 cars a year in steel, coal, chemicals, glass, fiberglass, sand, corn, barley, soybeans and lumber. Steve Gedney, however, said that it is hard to project actual car loadings. However, this number is certainly an improvement from the 5,800 cars it averaged yearly during the 1980s. An additional 4,000 cars could be added if Circle S undergoes a planned expansion. L&C; officials foresee moving between 18,000 and 20,000 cars a year in the future, but add that the line could handle upwards of 30,000 a year (on the original route) \\"without bumping into each other.\\" But it is the recent lease-purchase deal with Norfolk Southern that offers the most hope from growth on the Lancaster and Chester. \\"I think the main thing is our presence and having our operating headquarters in this area\\", Steve Gedney, the president of the railroad told this reporter. > \\"If we want to grow our business, which by doing that helps and assists the > local economy whether it be in Lancaster County, Chester County or even York > County, we do our own marketing in conjunction with the county economic > developers for both counties to try to locate companies and factories that > will use rail.\\" The primary customers on the new line are the Archers-Daniels-Midland plant in Kershaw and AmeriSteel on Riverside Road in Lancaster. Gedney envisions service to existing companies on the line that presently do not use rail. > \\"We are going to see what we can do initially with shippers that have been > on the line that have stopped shipping like Thomas and Betts. They’ve got a > rail siding going in there. We’re going to talk to them and see if there's > anything we can do to help their business which would put rail cars on the > line.\\" Additionally, a spur was put in at Southern Gas north of the interchange in Lancaster. Southern Railway once served this business, but that spur had been taken up years ago. The line has reshuffled the way they move the trains. In addition, they have put in 100 pound-per-yard (50 kg/m) switches. Presently everything that is on the main line right now on the Kershaw District is 85 lb/yd (42 kg/m) rail. This compares with the 127 to 132 lb/yd (63–66 kg/m) rail on the L&C;'s original line. New ties have been placed as well on all the curves. Gedney adds, \\"We’ve also done some bridge work on the 521 bridge. That's not major work, mainly just heavy maintenance.\\" Meanwhile, the L&C; and Lancaster County Economic Development Corporation President Ray Gardner are seeking new business to the line. \\"We’ve already identified some land around Heath Springs and Kershaw,\\" Gardner said and he suggested that it would be used to make a park. There are also two parcels of land in the northern part of the county. One is nearly of land at Foster Park. This area is on Riverside Road. \\"It's zoned I-2,\\" said Gardner, \\"heavy industrial. We hope to take advantage of that. On down Riverside Road near the airport, we hope the county is going to get us some land there.\\" \\"They didn’t go out of their way marketing,\\" Gardner said of how Norfolk Southern handled the line in Lancaster. \\"I’m not critical of them. But the L&C; has got better service. They’re more dependable. They’re local. If you need something, you can drive down there to see them. They’re eager just like we are.\\" The purchase of the former SB line in Lancaster has fueled speculation on whether the L&C; will ever make it into Catawba where interchange with CSX could be easier for Kershaw. Or perhaps even into Rock Hill. But more than six years after the L&C;'s end cabs set steel on the SB rails, this has not happened yet. What has happened is that the L&C; purchased their first non endcab units, two EMD GP38-2s that were originally leased from Helms Leasing after spending most of their career on Conrail. (They went to Norfolk Southern after the split.) They’ve also currently leasing four rebuilt GP38-2s from GMTX.

The legacy of the blood-maddened Mbwun lives on in \\"Reliquary\\", but the focus is shifted from the original museum setting to the tunnels beneath the streets of New York City. The book is the second in the Special Agent Pendergast series.Reliquary (Pendergast #2) Plot summary The story picks up where the epilogue of Relic left off. Two headless skeletons are found in the Humboldt Kill. When further decapitated bodies follow, there is suspicion of a second Mbwun monster. Major characters from the original book team up with new ones to solve the puzzle. The mystery soon leads underground to the Mole people, and even deeper towards enigmatic beings called the Wrinklers. In the end, it is revealed that the Wrinklers are led by Frock, who has refined a modified version of the Mbwun plant, created by Kawakita to regain the use of his legs. Kawakita also gave the drug to the people who were to become the Wrinklers, later made into his tribe by Frock. After going underground, the group kills them with an explosion, vitamin D infused water and a flood.

Baseball America rated David as the 56th best prospect in baseball prior to the 1992 season and the 23rd best prospect in baseball prior to the 1993 season. Despite excelling in 1992 spring training, David was optioned to the Triple-A Richmond Braves to start the 1992 season. He made his major league debut for the Braves on September 1, 1992, after MLB rosters expanded. David was the first pick for the expansion Colorado Rockies in the 1992 Major League Baseball expansion draft. Nied started in the first ever game for the Rockies, taking the loss against the New York Mets. He also pitched a number of other firsts for the Rockies, including first strikeout, first walk, first complete game, and first complete game shutout. He compiled a 5-9 won-loss record in 1993 then went 9-7 in 1994 but won no more games through the next two years, playing sparingly. In 1996 he was granted free agency and joined the Cincinnati Reds organization on November 14, 1996 but never appeared in a game in the majors or minors again and departed the game. In 2004, he was named a member of the Richmond Braves' top 18 players from the last twenty years. He was the only Colorado Rockies player to wear #17 for the franchise, prior to Todd Helton.

In 1901, commanding the training ship Miaoulis, he was sent to Boston. This was reported as the first transatlantic trip of a Greek war vessel. Kountouriotis served as an aide-de-camp to King Geórgios I from 1908 until 1911, receiving the rank of Captain in 1909. In June 1911, Kountouriotis was sent to Britain, to take control of the newly-commissioned , following the \\"blue cheese mutiny\\". As he was highly esteemed, he quickly reimposed discipline and set sail for Greece. =Balkan Wars= On 16 April 1912 he was appointed Chief of the Navy General Staff until 16 September, when he was appointed of the Aegean Fleet, in view of the worsening situation in the Balkans, and the imminent outbreak of the First Balkan War. Kountouriotis played a crucial role in the Greek government's decision to enter the war. Partly because the Greek fleet had not yet completed its modernization programme, and in view of the disaster of 1897, the Greek leadership remained ambivalent about Greece's prospects. Kountouriotis weighed in decisively in these discussions, proclaiming his confidence that even with the existing fleet, victory could be achieved, thanks to superior personnel. His reply to Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos became famous: During the Balkan Wars, with his flagship, Georgios Averof, he led the Greek Navy to major victories against the Turkish fleet in December 1912 (Battle of Elli) and in January 1913 (Battle of Limnos), bringing most of the Aegean islands under Greek control. His victories, due in large part to his daring but successful tactics, earned him the status of a national hero. He was promoted to vice admiral for \\"exceptional war service\\", the first Greek career officer since Constantine Kanaris to reach the rank (usually reserved for members of the Greek royal family). Politics In 1916, he became a minister in the Stephanos Skouloudis government, but, in disagreement with the pro-German feelings of King Konstantínos I of the Hellenes, he followed Eleftherios Venizelos to Thessaloniki where he was assigned the ministry of Naval Affairs in Venizelos' National Defence government. Konstantínos was deposed, and replaced on the throne by his second-eldest son, The Prince Aléxandros. Kountouriotis subsequently retired from the navy with the honorary rank of full Admiral. On the death of the young King Aléxandros of the Hellenes in 1920, he was elected Regent of Greece by the Greek Parliament on 28 October by a vote of 137 to 3.The Times (London), Friday 29 October 1920, p. 12 After the sitting government of Venizelos was defeated in the elections that took place in November 1920, Kountouriotis resigned as Regent on 17 November, to be replaced by Queen Olga, King Aléxandros's grandmother. The following month, King Konstantínos was restored. Kountouriotis in 1924 is sworn in as the first President of the Second Hellenic Republic =President= In March 1924, after King Geórgios II of the Hellenes was deposed, he was elected as the first President of the Second Hellenic Republic, but resigned the post in March, 1926, in opposition to General Pangalos' dictatorship. He was reelected President in May 1929, but due to serious health complications he resigned in December of the same year. Death and honors Hydra Admiral Pávlos Kountouriotis died in 1935. Α World War II Greek destroyer and a Standard-class frigate, Kountouriotis, are named after him. One of the two gold 100-Euro coins issued by Greece in 2012 to commemorate the centenary of the Balkan Wars featured Kountouriotis and Georgios Averof.

It is also used to improve respiratory secretions at the end of life. Hyoscine butylbromide can be taken by mouth, injection into a muscle, or into a vein. Side effects may include sleepiness, vision changes, dry mouth, rapid heart rate, triggering of glaucoma, and severe allergies. Sleepiness is uncommon. It is unclear if it is safe in pregnancy. It appears safe in breastfeeding. Greater care is recommended in those with heart problems. It is an anticholinergic agent, which does not have much effect on the brain. Hyoscine butylbromide was patented in 1950, and approved for medical use in 1951. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is not available in the United States, and a similar compound methscopolamine may be used instead. It is manufactured from hyoscine, which occurs naturally in the plant deadly nightshade. It is avaialble in the United States for the medical treatment of horses. Medical uses A package of injectable buscopan Hyoscine butylbromide is effective in treating crampy abdominal pain. Hyoscine butylbromide is effective in reducing the duration of the first stage of labour, and it is not associated with any obvious adverse outcomes in mother or neonate. It is also used during abdominal or pelvic MRI or CT scans to improve the quality of pictures. Side effects As little of the medication crosses the blood brain barrier it has less effect on the brain and therefore has reduced occurrence of the centrally mediated effects (such as delusions, somnolence, and inhibition of motor-functions) which hinder the usefulness of some other anticholinergic drugs. Hyoscine butylbromide is still capable of impacting the chemoreceptor trigger zone due to the lack of a well-developed blood-brain-barrier in the medulla oblongata, which potentiates the antiemetic effects that it produces via local action on the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract. Pharmacology Hyoscine butylbromide reduces the stimulation of smooth muscle contraction and the production of respiratory secretions. These are normally stimulated by the parasympathetic nervous system, via the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. As an antimuscarinic, hyoscine butylbromide binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, blocking their effect. It is a quaternary ammonium compound and a semisynthetic derivative of hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine). The attachment of the butyl-bromide moiety effectively prevents the movement of this drug across the blood–brain barrier, effectively minimising undesirable central nervous system side effects associated with scopolamine/hyoscine. Abuse Hyoscine butylbromide is not centrally active and has a low incidence of abuse. In 2015, it was reported that prisoners at Wandsworth Prison and other UK prisons were smoking prescribed hyoscine butylbromide, releasing the potent hallucinogen scopolamine. There have also been reports of abuse in Mashhad Central Prison in Iran.

He served as the Special Representative of INTERPOL to the United Nations, as well as the Special Adviser to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness until his retirement in 2014.DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY Appointments Early life Elliott received a Bachelor of Arts in 1976 and a Bachelor's degree in Common Law in 1979, both from the University of Ottawa. He was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1981 and remains a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada as a non-practicing lawyer. Career Elliott started his professional career in 1981 as a lawyer in a private law practice.

Voiced by Garrison Keillor, the character parodies the conventions of hardboiled fiction and the film noir genre. Guy Noir works on the twelfth floor of the Acme Building in a city that \\"knows how to keep its secrets\\", St. Paul, Minnesota. Exploits The first Guy Noir segments aired in 1995 and were heavy on tongue-twisters, alliteration and other wordplay. In early episodes of the series, Guy and his \\"friend\\" Pete (Walter Bobbie) would often get into fights and end up shooting each other. Both died many times. However, following Bobbie's departure as a show regular, Pete appears to have died off for good. In later episodes, Noir is a down-on- his-luck detective, who ends up taking odd jobs to get by, such as finding missing poodles. Thrown in with these plots tend to be references to current events. For example, in November 2006, while waiting for a case, Noir contents himself by listening to parts of George W. Bush's post-mid-term election speech. Occasionally, political agents use him for hatchet work. For the portion of A Prairie Home Companion's season that is performed outside of St. Paul, the setting of Noir's case usually involves the city that the program is visiting that week. In the same skit as the Bush reference, Noir is flown to Hawaii to look for a missing Minnesotan. That week, the show was broadcast from Hawaii. Recurring characters in the skits include: Sugar (Sue Scott), a romantic interest; Jimmy (Tim Russell), a bartender; and Wendell (Tom Keith), the boy who works at the deli around the corner. Wendell's nasal, pubescent voice and BLT sandwiches are always there for Noir, though his character is minor. Noir often runs into a beautiful, mysterious woman during the skits, part of the play on film noir movies. Jazzy saxophone music is played as Noir describes the beauty, sometimes to the point of absurdity. For example: > She was tall, blonde, in jeans that looked sprayed on and a T-shirt so tight > I could study her bone structure. I could see she wasn't from Duluth. There > were no chinstrap marks on her neck, her hair hadn't been deformed by > stocking caps, she didn't have that roll of fat around her middle—her > midriff was as tight as the cap on a pickle jar. and > She was tall and long-legged and her blonde hair hung down sort of like what > Beethoven had in mind when he wrote the Moonlight Sonata. She wore a knit > sweater and jeans so tight it looked as if she'd been poured into them and > forgot to say \\"When\\". When she moved, she seemed to undulate under her > clothes in ways that took a man's mind off supply side economics. and > She was tall and dark and so beautiful you wanted to just give her all your > money right away and skip the preliminaries. Noir is the protagonist of Keillor's book Guy Noir and the Straight Skinny, where he falls in with Naomi Fallopian and her get-rich-quick diet pill scheme. The story has many of the hallmarks of the radio dramas. In popular culture A 2006 Guy Noir skit, in which some characters had a fictitious variation of Tourette syndrome called \\"Broadway Tourette's\\", drew criticism from the Tourette Syndrome Association. Noir is played in the 2006 film A Prairie Home Companion by Kevin Kline. In the film, Guy's detective career is faltering, and he works as a security guard at a radio show to pay the bills. It is strongly implied that he is taken by an angel of death named Asphodel at the end of the movie, though since she is played by Virginia Madsen in a trench coat, this might be considered a relatively upbeat ending by Guy's standards. The late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone was a known fan of Noir; Noir was his favorite segment. Following his untimely 2002 death in a plane crash, the next APHC opened with a Noir segment, skipping even the show's theme song.

Two other sons, Thomas, and James, also became artists, as did his sister Susan. John began painting miniatures of local people when only nine years old.http://www.gatehouse-of- fleet.co.uk/index.php/the-faeds/223-the-faeds Until the age of 11, John attended Girthon Parish School. The Castle Douglas Weekly Visitor for 19 August 1831 recorded that at the examination of Girthon school \\"the company present were shown a beautiful and correct book of maps, executed by John Faed, as a specimen of his many and varied drawings, which often ere now have elicited the admiration of all who have seen them\\". He moved to Edinburgh in 1840 and in 1841 had his first exhibited work at the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1848 he is listed as a miniature painter living at 6 SW Circus Place in Stockbridge, Edinburgh.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1848 Faed primarily painted religious, literary, and historical scenes. He exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Academy almost continually. When he was President of the Kirkcudbrightshire Fine Art Association in 1899, his portrait of Sir Isaac Newton (painted when Faed was 36) was shown in the Dalbeattie Loan and Industrial Exhibition which took place in July and August that year.Faed also had a following in the United States. His Portrait of George Washington taking the Salute at Trenton was so popular that it was selected to illustrate an article on Washington in the Magazine of American History in 1880. His highly successful painting Shakespeare and his Friends at the Mermaid Tavern was sold to an American in 1851. His paintings, popular in Victorian Britain, can today be found in private and public collections, including the National Gallery of Scotland.

A Bence Jones protein is a monoclonal globulin protein or immunoglobulin light chain found in the urine, with a molecular weight of 22-24 kDa.Bernier, G. M. & Putnam, F. W. (1963). Nature (London), 200, 223±225. Detection of Bence Jones protein may be suggestive of multiple myeloma or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Bence Jones proteins are particularly diagnostic of multiple myeloma in the context of target organ manifestations such as kidney failure, lytic (or \\"punched out\\") bone lesions, anemia, or large numbers of plasma cells in the bone marrow of patients. Bence Jones proteins are present in 2/3 of multiple myeloma cases. The proteins are immunoglobulin light chains (paraproteins) and are produced by neoplastic plasma cells. They can be kappa (most of the time) or lambda. The light chains can be immunoglobulin fragments or single homogeneous immunoglobulins. They are found in urine as a result of decreased kidney filtration capabilities due to kidney failure, sometimes induced by hypercalcemia from the calcium released as the bones are destroyed or from the light chains themselves. The light chains have historically been detected by heating a urine specimen (which causes the protein to precipitate) and now by electrophoresis of concentrated urine.\\"Bence Jones protein test\\" in Farlex Free Medical Dictionary More recently, serum free light chain assays have been utilised in a number of published studies which have indicated superiority over the urine tests, particularly for patients producing low levels of monoclonal free light chains, as seen in nonsecretory multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis.

The character had a feud with Sting which lasted from fall to winter that year. History In August 1990, The Black ScorpionBlack Scorpion: Evil wrestling magician who tortured Sting with mystical magic powers, like the ability to turn a man into a tiger. It was all worth it for his final appearance, however, when he landed in a space ship. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the ultimate in stupidity, this scores 178. debuted in WCW (which was still under the NWA banner at the time) in vignettes taunting NWA World Heavyweight Champion Sting. He wore a hooded robe to conceal his face and warned Sting he was after him. The wrestler playing this part was Ole Anderson with his voice distorted enough to keep the fans pondering his identity. The announcers and parties involved attempted to imply that The Scorpion was a former friend of Sting, with the main suspects being former tag partner Jim Hellwig (a.k.a. The Ultimate Warrior, who was the WWF Champion at the time), or former training and Powerteam USA partner Dave Sheldon aka The Angel of Death. The Black Scorpion debuted in the ring against Sting for his title at Clash of the Champions XII on September 5, 1990. The wrestler playing him this time was Al Perez, who, according to Ric Flair, was supposed to remain The Black Scorpion until his unmasking—that is, before he quit. Sting was about to unmask him when another Black Scorpion appeared on the entrance ramp, allowing the one that wrestled to escape. The Scorpion would also incorporate amateur \\"magic\\" into his taunting of Sting by performing parlor tricks with members of the audience, presumably plants. According to one wrestling website, magician Franz Harary performed the illusions. Sting wrestled Black Scorpion at house shows but could never unmask him because of continuous attacks by Sid Vicious. The performers Sting faced at these house shows were either Jeff Ellis or The Angel of Death. The Black Scorpion gimmick was cut short by an accident in training when Anderson's arm was broken. His comeback plans had to be scrapped, and the injury forced a rewrite to the entire storyline. Anderson never returned to active wrestling again and would eventually become a referee. Eventually, a rematch was signed between Sting and the Black Scorpion for Starrcade. It was to be a cage match with professional wrestling legend Dick the Bruiser as the special guest referee. The rule was if the Black Scorpion did not win the title, he would be forced to reveal his identity. Sting defeated the Black Scorpion with a flying shoulder tackle off the top rope. The Scorpion was unmasked to reveal Ric Flair. According to Flair, it would have been either himself or Barry Windham. Flair volunteered thinking the gimmick wouldn't hurt him, whereas it could Windham, who recently portrayed an imposter Sting at Halloween Havoc on October 27. The Black Scorpion angle ended with Flair's unmasking. Flair, as himself, ended up winning the title from Sting at a WCW house show less than a month later.

For the prehistoric antelope genus, see Duboisia (antelope). Duboisia (commonly called corkwood tree) is a genus of small perennial shrubs and trees up to 14 metres (46 feet) tall, with extremely light wood and a thick corky bark. There are four species; all occur in Australia, and one also occurs in New Caledonia. The alternate, glabrous leaves are narrow and elliptical. The inflorescence is an open cymose panicle of apically small white flowers, sometimes with a purple or mauve striped tube. They flower profusely in spring. The fruit is a small, globular, black, juicy berry. Aboriginal Australians sometimes chew the nicotine-containing leaves of Duboisia hopwoodii (see entry on pituri) mixed with wood ash for their stimulant and, after extended use, depressant effects. The leaves of Duboisia leichhardtii and Duboisia myoporoides also contain scopolamine and hyoscyamine, along with some other pharmaceutically important alkaloids. A derivative of scopolamine is the drug butylscopolamine, a potent peripherally acting antispasmodic. These trees are commercially grown for the pharmaceutical industry.

Much of its development was attributable to the entrepreneur James Murray's decision to build his summer home, Cally House there in 1763. The house is now the Cally Palace Hotel. Over the next hundred years, the town developed into a centre for industry, particularly cotton mills. The western approach to the town is dominated by the imposing Cardoness Castle. Gatehouse of Fleet is the birthplace of Victorian artist John Faed. The renowned inventor of clockwork mechanisms, Robert Williamson, was also known to have set up a workshop in the town in 1778, which burned to the ground in 1794, killing him. The town takes its name from its location near the mouth of the river called the Water of Fleet which empties into Wigtown Bay at Fleet Bay, and its former role as the \\"Gait House\\" or \\"the House on the Road on the River Fleet\\" or toll booth of the late 18th century stagecoach route from Dumfries to Stranraer, now the A75 road. It was a haven along this route, and travellers would often stop in the area rather than furthering the journey at night due to the high numbers of bandits and highwaymen at the time. Cally House was designed by Robert Mylne and built in 1763. The house was sold in 1933 and became a hotel, which opened in 1934. It was used as a residential school for evacuees from Glasgow during the Second World War, reopening as an hotel in the later 1940s. The settlement of Anwoth is one mile (1.5 km) to the west of Gatehouse of Fleet; this is where Samuel Rutherford was minister from 1627 to 1636. Gatehouse has the second oldest average population of towns in Scotland. Jeanie Donnan, (1864-1942), \\"The Galloway Poetess\\", was born here before moving to Whithorn in Wigtownshire where she lived on George Street and where she is commemorated by a plaque. She wrote poetry about local events. Her works include Hameland: The Poems of Jeannie Donnan, 1907; War Poems, 1915; The Hills of Hame, 1930. Many of her poems were also published in the Galloway Gazette. Church of the Resurrection, 1971 designed by Sutherland, Dickie & Copland. The church is lit by a dramatic clerestory window.

Since the closure of this church on 1 February 2020 and ahead of its demolition, the sculptures have been removed to St Andrew and St Cuthbert Church in Kirkcudbright. The Swallows is an artwork created in willow by local artist Lizzie Farey and was a memorial commission. The last Mass was celebrated on 1 February 2020 by the Bishop of Galloway, William Nolan and parish priest Rev Fr William McFadden. The church will be demolished and the site sold for housing.

A zero-delay pull fuze which is normally connected to a tripwire. The MUV fuze is fully compatible with F1 and RGD-5 grenades. Fitting an MUV fuze makes it easier to conceal the grenade when setting a boobytrap e.g. partial burial. Note that the detonator is usually threaded, so it can be screwed into the F1 grenade body The Soviet F1 hand grenade (Russian: Фугасный > Fugasnyy 1, \\"Explosive, Type #1\\"), is an anti-personnel fragmentation defensive grenade. It is based on the French F1 grenade and contains a 60-gram explosive charge (TNT). The total weight of the grenade with the fuze is about 600 grams. Due to its shape and its yellow-green color, it is nicknamed the (fem. \\"lemon\\"). It is also nicknamed Efka () for the letter F.Yu. Veremeev, \\"Происхождение \\"лимонки\\". It is similar to the American Mk 2 \\"pineapple grenade\\", which was also ultimately modeled on the French F1. Fuse The UZRGM (Universal'nyi Zapal, Ruchnaya Granata, Modernizirovannyi, 'Universal Igniter, Hand Grenade, Improved') fuse is a universal Russian type also used in the RG-41, RG-42, RGO-78, RGN-86 and RGD-5 grenades. The standard time delay for this fuse is 3.5 to 4 seconds. However, UZRGM fuse variants are available which give delays between zero (i.e., instantaneous, specifically for use in booby-traps) and 13 seconds. It is possible to hear a loud \\"pop\\" as the fuse ignites and begins to burn. History The F1 was introduced during World War II and subsequently redesigned post-war. It has a steel exterior that is notched to facilitate fragmentation upon detonation and to prevent hands from slipping. The distance the grenade can be thrown is estimated at 30–45 meters. The radius of the shrapnel dispersion is up to 200 meters (effective radius is about 30 meters, by some sources (Russian)). Hence, the grenade has to be deployed from a defensive position to avoid self harm. About 60 percent of the grenade body pulverizes during the explosion, only 30 percent of the body splints into 290 high velocity sharp cut splinters each weighing around 1 gram with initial speed of about 700 meters per second. Foreign copies The F1 grenade has been supplied to various Soviet allies and Third World nations over the years, including Iraq and other Arab nations, and there are different production variations according to country of origin (in terms of finish, markings and spoon/lever design). Though obsolete and no longer in production, it can still be encountered in combat zones. *: Type 1 Grenade.

Since this is almost universally fatal, it is considered an especially conspicuous and selfless act of individual sacrifice in wartime; in United States military history, more citations for the Medal of Honor have been awarded for falling on grenades to save comrades than any other single act. Such an act can be survivable: in World War II, U.S. Marine Jack Lucas, in the Battle of Iwo Jima, placed two grenades under his steel M1 helmet and himself before they exploded. Lucas lived, but spent the rest of his life with over 200 pieces of shrapnel in his body. In 2008 near Sangin in Afghanistan, British Royal Marine Matthew Croucher used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor; his body armor absorbed the majority of the blast. On November 21, 2010 in Marjah, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, U.S. Marine Lance Corporal Kyle Carpenter threw himself upon a grenade, thrown onto a rooftop, to save a fellow Marine, sustaining injuries to his face and right arm and losing his right eye; he survived these wounds. Despite these rare instances, however, the odds of survival are extremely slim. With modern medicine, however, odds are greatly increased when compared to falling on a grenade in the 20th century. John Andrew Barnes III was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor when he jumped on a grenade to save the lives of wounded comrades in the Vietnam War. United States Navy SEAL Michael A. Monsoor was also posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor after using his body to smother a grenade on a rooftop in Ramadi, Iraq, saving the lives of other SEALs and Iraqi soldiers. Milton L.

He is best known for his collaboration with Helen Schucman in typing the original manuscript and being on the editing team for A Course in Miracles (ACIM), a self-study curriculum in religious psychology. He died in 1988, aged 65, in Tiburon, California, after having made his involvement with the ACIM material and its study the most central focus of his life.  Early childhood  Thetford was born on April 25, 1923, in Chicago, Illinois to John and Mabel Thetford as the youngest of three children. At the time of his birth and early childhood, his parents were both regular members of the Christian Science church. At the age of seven, the untimely death of his older sister caused his parents to disavow their affiliation with the Church of Christian Science. Afterwards, for the next few years, Thetford sampled various other Protestant denominations. At the age of nine he contracted a severe case of scarlet fever, which led to rheumatic fever and a debilitating heart condition. These resulting health problems forced him to spend the next three years at home recuperating. During his forced recuperation period he took advantage of the many free hours, using the time to satisfy his voracious appetite for reading. Despite his absence from the classroom, he entered high school at the age of twelve.  University education  Following graduation from high school, he was awarded a four-year scholarship to DePauw University in Indiana where he graduated with majors in psychology and pre-medicine in 1944. During the course of his university studies, Thetford eventually settled on the idea of specializing in psychology, and in 1949 he received his PhD in this field from the University of Chicago. After graduating from DePauw in January 1944 until the summer of 1945, Thetford had a job as an administrative officer at the University of Chicago working with the scientific team doing atomic research. In his graduate studies he was fortunate to be one of the first students of the renowned psychologist, Carl Rogers.  Career and hiring of Helen Schucman  For the five years following his graduation in 1949, Thetford worked as a research psychologist in both Chicago, and later in Washington, D.C. He was a research psychologist in the Institute for Psychosomatic & Psychiatric Research & Training at the Reese Hospital in Chicago from 1949-1951 and a senior psychologist for the United States government in Washington, DC from 1951-1954. In 1953 he was a consultant in Beirut, Lebanon at the Foreign Service Institute.\\"William Newton Thetford\\" Marquis Who's Who at worldcat.org. retrieved 17 August 2014. He spent 1954 and 1955 as the director of clinical psychology at The Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut. From 1955 to 1957 he was an assistant professor of psychology at Cornell University. In 1958 he accepted an assistant professorship, which later developed into a full professorship, at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. During a portion of this same period he also served as the Director of Clinical Psychology at the Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. It was here that he would stay for the next 20 years, and it was here that he first met Helen Schucman, hiring her as a research psychologist and assistant. A c.v. listing his positions, affiliations, grants, publications and papers is given as Appendix 2 in a biography Never Forget to Laugh by Carol Howe.  \\"Invitation\\" for A Course in Miracles  The working relationship between Thetford and Schucman was apparently often somewhat strained, yet throughout these difficulties they would always maintain a certain level of professional courtesy and respect for one another. The story is often retold that it was into this environment of inter-relational strain between Thetford and Schucman that the ACIM material was in a sense first “invited” into this world. This “invitation” came in the form of an exclamation by Thetford one day, in the midst of one of their periodic difficulties, in which Thetford exclaimed, “There must be another way!” This exclamation was followed by a certain speech he made to Schucman describing how he believed that it was time for them to try to refocus their energies on constructive and helpful agendas, rather than being forever hyper critical and hyper competitive with one another. Expecting a typically condescending response from Schucman, the studied silence that followed his speech was then followed by a most surprising concurrence from Schucman, fully supporting his new proposal. This speech was given in June 1965.Wapnick, Kenneth (1991). Absence from Felicity, pp. 93ffFoundation for Inner Peace, The Scribing of A Course in Miracles The next four months were filled with a number of unusually vivid dream sequences and even some unusual waking experiences for Schucman. Amongst her vivid dream sequences, she began to become familiar with a certain internal character who spoke to her as Jesus in her dreams. Little did she know that the voice of this dream character would soon come to dominate the rest of her life. Many of her unusual experiences during these four months are recorded in the biographical work, Absence from Felicity, by Kenneth Wapnick.Wapnick, Kenneth (1991). Absence from Felicity, pp. 97–131 Schucman appears to have confided her experiences with Thetford, who acted as a sort of a calming, encouraging and stabilizing influence for Schucman during this period.  A Course in Miracles transcription  Finally in October of that year, the transcriptions of what is now known as A Course In Miracles first began. According to both Thetford and Schucman, due to Schucman's intensely divided feelings about the work of the transcription, Schucman would at times require a great deal of reassurance from Thetford in order to complete the process that eventually resulted in the first typewritten copy of ACIM, which later became known as the Urtext. According to Thetford, Schucman was sitting at home on the night of October 21, 1965, when she heard an internal \\"voice\\" say to her, \\"This is a course in miracles. Please take notes.\\" When she first heard this internal voice, she thought she recognized it as the same voice of the dream sequence character that in her recent dream sequences had represented the person of Jesus to her. Schucman then wrote down about a page of notes before she realized that this request was going to be of much greater significance, and would require a far greater commitment in time than it had ever asked of her before. In a panic, she phoned Thetford to ask for his advice. Thetford encouraged Schucman to do what the voice asked, and to take the notes. He offered to meet with her the next morning before work, to review her notes, to discuss them further with her, and then to determine what she should do with this \\"Voice\\".Wapnick, Kenneth (1991), p. 199 On the following morning, after Thetford's review of the notes, he was so impressed with what she read to him that he encouraged Schucman to continue with the note taking. Schucman was initially taken aback by Thetford's reaction, but then apparently after giving herself enough time to recover from her initial jitters to honestly review the notes herself, she agreed. Soon they recognized that the notes, which eventually became A Course in Miracles (referred to as The Course by ACIM students), was their answer, the \\"other way\\" that they had agreed to find together four months earlier. Classifying this transcription process as one of Schucman's unusual waking experiences is an understatement at best. During the process Schucman claimed to have the mental equivalent of a tape recorder in her thoughts, which she described as being able to turn on and off at will, at her convenience, so that she might be able to transcribe into shorthand notes, what she was internally hearing. This voice identified itself as none other than the historical Jesus. During the beginning of this process, one of Thetford's gentle complaints was, “In the beginning I spent most of my time while typing these notes with one hand on the typewriter and the other on Helen’s shoulder”. After some months of experiencing an initial struggle in this process, eventually they both began to experience less subconscious resistance to the process, and the initial transcription began to move along more smoothly. From 1965 through 1972 Thetford directly assisted Schucman with the transcription of the first three sections of the work, which was in fact the great bulk of the material. Then in 1972, somewhat to both of their reliefs (yet on some levels to their dismay) it appeared that the writing was complete, which for the most part it was. In 1972 Thetford and Schucman were introduced to Kenneth Wapnick through their mutual friend Father Groeshel. Wapnick was intrigued by the manuscript although he soon realized it needed considerable editing to render it into a publishable format. Wapnick urged Helen to go over the manuscript once again with his assistance, which they did, bringing the final editing to a completion in the Spring of 1975. Thetford, Wapnick and Schucman, the three principle transcriber-editors of ACIM were to remain friends for the rest of their lives, throughout the arduous process of seeing this manuscript through to first successful publication, and beyond to witness the initial spreading of its teachings. After the completion of the bulk of the initial scribing/ transcribing process, for brief periods during 1973, 1975, and 1977 the short transcriptions of Psychotherapy, of Clarification of Terms, and of the Song of Prayer, which are the remainder of the standard material of ACIM, were transcribed in similar fashion. From 1971 to 1978 Thetford, along with David Saunders, headed the CIA mind control Project MKULTRA Subproject 130: Personality Theory.  Move to California  In 1978 Thetford resigned from his positions at both Columbia University and at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. In 1980 he packed up his household, and at the apparent invitation of Judith Skutch Whitson, moved to Tiburon, California, where Whitson was by now employed full-time in the publication and distribution of ACIM. Now in Tiburon at age 57, Thetford transitioned into a sort of semi-retirement, no longer accepting any demanding positions of heavy responsibility in either his professional life, or in his involvement with the ever growing readership of ACIM. In California Thetford took on two part-time professional positions; one as a psychology consultant at Travis Air Force Base and the other as one of the directors of the ACIM related Center for Attitudinal Healing in Tiburon, as offered to him by his friend and fellow student of ACIM, Dr. Gerald Jampolsky. In California Thetford spent the final eight years of his life regularly attending meetings of fellow ACIM students where ACIM principles would be discussed, but only rarely engaging in these discussions in any kind of an authoritative manner. Instead, during this final period of his life, he appears to have been primarily concerned with his own personal study of the ACIM material, and with enriching his own grasp of its message. On July 4, 1988, at age 65 Thetford died of a massive heart attack.

There were barricades in the streets and camouflaged protestors threw Molotov cocktails and cobblestones. There were also reported attacks on journalists and breaking of shop windows in the city center. Tear gas and water cannon were used to force back a breakaway group of activists that attempted to reach the summit venue to shut down the meetings of the global financial institutions.

Advertising Standards Authority rulings In 2005, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) responded to an advertisement for a book titled \\"How to Stop Your Doctor Killing You\\" by Coleman, which claimed doctors were \\"the person most likely to kill you\\". Complainants, including a GP, challenged whether the advertisement was misleading, offensive and denigratory to the medical profession. Coleman did not respond to the Advertising Standards Authorities request and was found to have been in breach of the ASA's code of conduct concerning non-response, substantiation, truthfulness and intent to cause fear and distress. The Advertising Standards Authority also found Coleman had made misleading claims regarding the link between food and cancer. The ASA deemed the advert was likely to offend and denigrate the medical profession and noted Coleman's claims such as \\"Ten reasons why you shouldn't trust your doctor\\" were irresponsible, as they would discourage people from seeking essential medical help.

It was originally intended as a test of a TX-16/EC-16 Jughead bomb, but the design became obsolete after the Castle Bravo test was successful. The test device was replaced with a TX-24/EC-24 Runt II bomb which was detonated on May 5, 1954, at Bikini Atoll. It released energy equivalent to 13.5 megatons of TNT, the second-largest yield ever in a U.S. fusion weapon test. Jughead Yankee was originally intended to be a test of a TX-16/EC-16, a weaponized version of the large and complex Ivy Mike device. A small number of emergency capability EC-16s were produced, without being tested, to provide a stop-gap thermonuclear weapon capability in response to the Russian nuclear weapons program. The test device, code-named Jughead, had been prepared as a backup in case the non-cryogenic Castle Bravo Shrimp device failed to work. The test of Jughead was cancelled when the Bravo test was successful, and the cryogenic EC-16s were withdrawn and dismantled. Runt II Jughead was replaced by the Runt II device (a TX-24/EC-24), developed from the Castle Romeo Runt device (a TX-17/EC-17). Externally identical, the principal difference between them was in the fuel for the fusion stage. While Runt used natural lithium (with 7.5% of the Lithium-6 isotope), Runt II used the same partially enriched lithium (approximately 40% Lithium-6) as the Shrimp device of Castle Bravo. It was detonated on May 5, 1954, at Bikini Atoll of the Marshall Islands, on a barge moored in the middle of the crater from the Castle Union test. Although it had been predicted to produce a yield of 6 to 10 megatons, it actually produced a yield of 13.5 megatons, the second-largest ever yield in a U.S. fusion weapon test. Like the Mike, Bravo and Romeo tests, a large percentage of the yield was produced by fast fission of the natural uranium tamper. Of the total yield, 7 megatons were from fission; the other 6.5 megatons were from fusion reactions. The high fusion yield was due to the enriched fuel and set a U.S. record that stood until Hardtack Poplar in 1958. External links  * Operation Castle References * Chuck Hansen, U. S.

Edwards County, Texas on the Edwards Plateau is named for him. In 1825, Edwards received a land grant from the Mexican government, allowing him to settle families in East Texas. His grant included the city of Nacogdoches, and Edwards soon angered many of the previous settlers. After his contract was revoked in 1826, Edwards and his brother declared the colony to be the Republic of Fredonia. He was forced to flee Mexico when the Mexican army arrived to put down the rebellion, and did not return until after the Texas Revolution had broken out. He was also located near the Sabine River. The main town was called Nacogdoches.  Early life  Haden Edwards was born in Stafford County, Virginia, on August 12, 1771. He was the son of John Edwards Sr., who later became one of the first two U. S. Senators from Kentucky. Haden Edwards married Susanna Beall of Maryland and they had 13 children born in Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana & Georgia. One of his sons was Haden Harrison Edwards.\\"Edwards, Haden.\\" Handbook of Texas. Retrieved on June 6, 2011. In 1820 Haden Edwards and his brother Benjamin acquired a plantation near Jackson, Mississippi. Mexican Texas to American immigration, Edwards traveled to Mexico City, where he joined forces with Stephen F. Austin, among others, in a 3-year attempt to persuade various Mexican governments to pass a law to allow Americans to settle in Texas. In 1824 the Mexican federal government passed a General Colonization Law, which for the first time permitted immigration into Texas. Under the terms of the law, each state would set its own requirements for immigration. On March 24, 1825, Coahuila y Tejas passed (2000), p. 37. Despite his abrasive attitude, Edwards was granted a colonization contract on April 14. The contract allowed him to settle 800 families in East Texas. It contained standard language requiring Edwards to recognize all pre-existing Spanish and Mexican land titles in his grant area, to raise a militia to protect the settlers in the area, and to allow the state land commissioner to certify all deeds that Edwards would award.Ericson (2000), p. 37.Davis (2006), p. 70. Edwards's colony encompassed the land from the Navasota River to 20 leagues west of the Sabine River, and from 20 leagues north of the Gulf of Mexico to 15 leagues north of the town of Nacogdoches. To the west and north of the colony were lands controlled by several native tribes which had recently been driven out of the United States. The southern boundary was a colony belonging to Stephen F. Austin, the first empresario in Texas; he had received special permission to establish his colony several years previously. East of Edwards's grant was the former Sabine Free State, a neutral zone which had been essentially lawless for several decades.Ericson (2000), p. 36. Edwards arrived in Nacogdoches in August 1825. Under the mistaken belief that he was authorized to determine the validity of pre-existing land deeds,Ericson (2000), p. 38. in September Edwards posted notices alerting all residents that they must provide written proof of their ownership or their land would be forfeited and sold at auction.Ericson (2000), p. 38. None of the English-speaking residents had valid titles; those who had not arrived as filibusters had been duped by land speculators.Samora et al (1993), p. 79. Most of the Spanish-speaking landowners were unable to find documentation that their families might have received 70 or more years previously. Edwards's goal was to remove many of the less-prosperous settlers and assign their lands to wealthy planters from the southern United States. A wealthy planter himself, Edwards scorned the residents who were poorer or of a different race than himself. Anticipating that there might be conflict between the new empresario and the long-time residents of the area, municipality acting alcalde Luis Procela and the municipality clerk, Jose Antonio Sepulveda, began validating old Spanish and Mexican land titles. Edwards accused the men of forging deeds. It is likely that both Edwards and the municipality authorities were in the wrong; the state land commissioner had been given authority to validate existing land titles.Ericson (2000), pp. 38-39. The settlers protested to Political Chief Saucedo. In June 1826 Mexican President Guadalupe Victoria annulled Edward’s contract and expelled him from Mexico. Word traveled slowly. On November 22, 1826, thirty-six armed men who supported Edwards, arrested the anti-Edwards alcalde Samuel Norris and other officials. The party then arrested Jose Antonio Sepulveda, the commander of Nacogdoches’ tiny Mexican militia.  Mexican response  On December 16, 1826 the rebels rode into Nacogdoches and raised a flag of independence. On December 21, 1826 Edwards signed a document declaring the Republic of Fredonia, which would comprise land from the Sabine River to the Rio Grande. On December 13, 1826 Mexican Colonel Mateo Ahumada and Saucedo moved against the Texas rebels. Austin rallied the other colonist against Edwards and his attempt at open rebellion. Austin offered to negotiate with Edwards, but he refused. On January 22, 1827 Colonel Ahumada moved towards Nacogdoches. All was not going well inside the Edwards camp either. There was internal fighting and the rebellion weakened. With the advancing Mexican and Anglo troops Edwards fled to Louisiana for safety on January 28, 1827. He returned to Texas during the Texas Revolution, participated in the battle of Nacogdoches in 1832 and made his home in Nacogdoches until his death, on August 14, 1849.

On 18 June 1342 Malcolm Fleming, Earl of Wigtown, was granted a charter of the lands of Cardoness, in Galloway, from King David II in excambion (exchange) for the lands of Mochrum which the King had formerly given him. He was also granted other lands in Wigtownshire. The lands of Cardoness were in the McCulloch family by 1466. Writing in 1864, Sir Andrew Agnew recorded a local tradition relating how the McCullochs came to possess Cardoness: Cardoness Castle interior The McCulloch lairds built the present Cardoness Castle in the late 15th century. In the 1560s, an English spy reported on the castle to Elizabeth I of England, in preparation for a planned invasion of Scotland that never took place. In 1622 the Gordons of Ardwall acquired the mortgaged estate. Feuding between the McCullochs and the Gordons culminated in 1690 when Sir Godfrey McCulloch shot dead William Gordon of Buck o'Bield. Sir Godfrey escaped to France, but was spotted in Edinburgh in 1697 and beheaded on the Maiden, the Scottish equivalent of the guillotine. It was subsequently uninhabited, and passed through the hands of a number of owners before being placed in state care in 1927. It has been protected as a scheduled monument since 1928, and is now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland. The castle is open to the public.

II (2012). Son of a Bandit, Jesse James & The Leeds Gang. Monaco Publishing, L.L.C. He was born in Nashville, Tennessee during the height of Jesse James' career as an outlaw. His mother was Zerelda, Jesse James' wife and first cousin. Personal life James was named after his father and American Outlaw Jesse James. He went by the name of Tim Edwards in his youth to conceal his relationship to his father. After his father's death, James and his family lived in Kansas City and were taken under the wing of Thomas T. Crittenden Jr., the son of Governor Thomas Theodore Crittenden, who had signed what would become the death warrant of the outlaw Jesse James. In 1898 James was arrested, and stood trial in 1899, for the robbery of a Missouri Pacific train, but was acquitted. James married Stella Frances McGowan (Feb 27, 1882 – Jan 1, 1951) on January 2, 1900 in the parlor of his mother's home, though she was too sick to attend the wedding. The couple had four daughters: *Lucille Martha James (born December 21, 1900 – June 11, 1988) *Josephine Frances James (born April 20, 1902 – March 31, 1964) *Jessie Estell James (born August 27, 1906 – February 2, 1987) *Ethell Rose James (born July 10, 1908 – December 21, 1991) The Jameses moved to Los Angeles, California, in the 1920s, where for a time they ran a restaurant called \\"The Jesse James Inn\\", and remained in California until his death in 1951. Career Following his acquittal for train robbery, James wrote a book, Jesse James, My Father (), which was published in 1899. He owned a pawn shop in Kansas City while studying law. In 1906 James passed the Bar exam in Missouri, and opened a law practice in Kansas City. He appeared in the 1921 film Jesse James Under the Black Flag with his sister Mary James Barr and in Jesse James as the Outlaw. He served as technical adviser on Paramount's 1927 biopic of his father titled Jesse James. This film starred cowboy hero Fred Thomson, who usually was a good guy to film audiences. Here Thomson plays Jesse James in a lighthearted way which many old timers who remembered Jesse James's murdering and robbing found inaccurate. The film proved to be unpopular.

The missions introduced European livestock, fruits, vegetables, and industry into the Texas area. In addition to the presidio (fortified church) and pueblo (town), the misión was one of the three major agencies employed by the Spanish crown to extend its borders and consolidate its colonial territories. In all, twenty-six missions were maintained for different lengths of time within the future boundaries of the state of Texas. Since 1493, Spain had maintained missions throughout New Spain (Mexico and portions of what today are the southwestern United States) to facilitate colonization. The eastern Tejas missions were a direct response to fear of French encroachment when the remains of La Salle's Fort Saint Louis were discovered near Matagorda Bay in 1689, and a response to the first permanent French outposts along the Gulf Coast ten years later. Following government policy, Franciscan missionaries sought to make life within mission communities closely resemble that of Spanish villages and Spanish culture. To become Spanish citizens and \\"productive\\" inhabitants, Native Americans learned vocational skills, such as plows, farm implements, and gear for horses, oxen, and mules fell into disrepair, blacksmithing skills soon became indispensable. Weaving skills were needed to help clothe the inhabitants. As buildings became more elaborate, mission occupants learned masonry and carpentry under the direction of craftsmen contracted by the missionaries. In the closely supervised setting of the mission the Native Americans were expected to mature in Christianity and Spanish political and economic practices until they would no longer require special mission status. Then their communities could be incorporated as such into ordinary colonial society. This transition from official mission status to ordinary Spanish society, when it occurred in an official manner, was called \\"secularization.\\" In this official transaction, the mission's communal properties were privatized, the direction of civil life became a purely secular affair, and the direction of church life was transferred from the missionary religious orders to the Catholic diocesan church. Although colonial law specified no precise time for this transition to take effect, increasing pressure for the secularization of most missions developed in the last decades of the 18th century. This mission system was developed in response to the often very detrimental results of leaving the Hispanic control of relations with Native Americans on the expanding frontier to overly enterprising civilians and soldiers. This had resulted too often in the abuse and even enslavement of the Indians and a heightening of antagonism. In the end, the mission system was not politically strong enough to protect the Native Americans against the growing power of ranchers and other business interests that sought control over mission lands and the manpower represented by the Native Americans. In the first few years of the new Republic of Mexico- between 1824 and 1830-all the missions still operating in Texas were officially secularized, with the sole exception of those in the El Paso district, which were turned over to diocesan pastors only in 1852. Within boundaries of Spanish Texas Spanish Texas was a part of New Spain. On its southern edge, Texas was bordered by the province of Coahuila. The boundary between the provinces was set at the line formed by the Medina and the Nueces Rivers, northeast of the Rio Grande.Edmondson (2000), p. 6. On the east, Texas bordered French Louisiana. Although Spain claimed that the Red River formed the boundary between the two, France insisted that the border was the Sabine River, to the west.Edmondson (2000), p. 10. =Mission San Francisco de la Espada= Mission San Francisco de la Espada The first mission established within the boundaries of Spanish Texas was San Francisco de la Espada. In 1689, Spanish authorities found the remnants of a French settlement, Fort Saint Louis.Chipman (1992), p. 83. During their expedition, the Spanish met representatives of the Caddo people, who lived between the Trinity and the Red Rivers. The Caddo expressed interest in learning about Christianity,Weber (1992), p. 153. and the following year Alonso De León led an expedition to establish a mission in East Texas. It was completed near the Hasinai village of Nabedaches in late May, and its first mass was conducted on June 1, 1690.Chipman (1992), p. 89.Weber (1992), p. 154. Mission Espada's aqueduct In its first two years of existence, the mission faced much hardship, as floodwaters and then drought destroyed their crops. After an epidemic killed half of the local population, the Hasinai became convinced that the missionaries had caused the deaths.Mason (1974), p. 35. Fearing an attack, on October 25, 1693 the missionaries buried the mission bell, set the building ablaze, and retreated to Mexico.Mason (1974), p. 36. The mission was reestablished on July 3, 1716, as Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas.Chipman (1992), p. 113. In 1721, it was renamed Mission San Francisco de los Neches. It was moved in 1731 to San Antonio where it was named Mission San Francisco de la Espada. The surviving structure is now part of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park operated by the National Park Service. A commemorative representation of Mission San Francisco de los Tejas, is located in Weches at Mission Tejas State Park. =Mission Santísimo Nombre de María= Mission Santísimo Nombre de María was the second mission established by the Spanish in East Texas. Built for the native Neches population, the mission opened in September 1690 northeast of Mission San Francisco. The mission consisted of a straw chapel and a house for the priest. It was destroyed by a flood in 1692.Maxwell (1998), p. 17. =Mission San Juan Capistrano= Mission San Juan Capistrano Mission San Juan Capistrano had been known as Mission San José de los Nazonis in East Texas. When the mission was relocated to San Antonio in 1731, it was renamed so as not to cause confusion with Mission San José y San Miguel de Aguayo. Located south of Mission San José, San Juan Capistrano served Coahuiltecan natives. It was the most distant of the missions from the presidio at Bexar and was often raided by Apaches. By 1762, the mission consisted of a stone chapel with stone rooms for the priests and the soldiers who lived at the mission. Rooms made of adobe were built along the walls to house the 200 resident Native American peoples. The mission was secularized in 1794, with the property divided among the remaining mission Indians. A priest continued to hold church services there, but other mission activities ended.Maxwell (1998), p. 37. The church has been restored and is still an active parish. =Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña= The front of Mission Concepción This mission was originally established on the Angelina River in East Texas in 1716 as Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de los Ainais. It served the Ainais tribe. It was closed because of the French threat and reopened in 1721. In 1730, it moved temporarily to present-day Austin before moving to San Antonio in 1731, where it was renamed Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña. The name was changed because the mission no longer served the Ainais tribe, and its new name honored the current viceroy of Mexico.Maxwell (1998), p. 33. The mission inherited the lands of the closed Mission San Franscisco Xavier de Najera south of San Antonio de Valero. Most of the Native Americans at the mission were Coahuiltecans who disliked the hard work of mission life. The Native Americans often ran away and were brought back forcibly by soldiers or priests. The current church building was completed in 1755 and is the oldest unrestored stone church in the United States. It is built in the shape of a cross, with walls that are thick. The mission was closed in 1794, with the property divided among the resident Native Americans, all of whom has left by 1800.Maxwell (1998), p. 34. For a time, the buildings were used as a cattle barn, but in 1855 the land and church were given to the Brothers of Mary, who cleaned it and began conducting services again. It is now open to the public for prayer, and is part of the National Park Service.Maxwell (1998), p. 36. =Mission San José de los Nazonis= Mission San José de los Nazonis was the third mission established in East Texas in 1716. Located near a Nazoni village, the mission was near the present-day site of Cushing, Texas. Although the mission closed after the French took the presidio at Los Adaes, it was reopened several years later by the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo. In 1730, it was moved temporarily to what is now Austin, Texas near Barton Springs only for a few months before being permanently relocated to San Antonio, where it became known as San Juan Capistrano.Maxwell (1998), p. 18. =Mission Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe= Mission Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe was established in 1756 in central Texas near present-day New Braunfels, Texas to serve the local Waco and Tonkawa tribes congregating near the headwaters of the Comal river. It was closed in 1758 because of perceived Comanche depredations and was never protected by a complementing presidio garrison.Gunnar Brune, \\"COMAL SPRINGS,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed March 27, 2012. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. =Mission Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de los Nacogdoches= Mission Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de los Nacogdoches was established in 1716 in East Texas to serve the Nacogdoche tribe. It closed several years later because of threats from French Louisiana but reopened in 1721. The mission continued until 1773, when the Spanish government ordered all of East Texas to be abandoned. In 1779, Antonio Gil Y'Barbo led a group of settlers who had been removed from Los Adaes to the area to settle in the empty mission buildings. This began the town of Nacogdoches, Texas.Maxwell (1998), p. 19. =Mission Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Ais= Mission Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de los Ais was originally established in 1717 in the area of Ayish Bayou (modern San Augustine, Texas) by Father Antonio Margil de Jesus. The mission was built to convert the local Ais Native Americans. Following the Chicken War in 1719, Spanish officials closed the East Texas missions and Father Margil and others were relocated to San Antonio. During the next year, Father Margil founded Mission San José (Texas). Mission Dolores was reestablished in 1721. Missionaries continued their work until 1773 when the East Texas missions were once again closed. Archeologists confirmed the location of the mission in the late 1970s. It is one of three archeologically confirmed mission locations in East Texas and the only site open to the public. The City of San Augustine constructed a museum, campground and archeology lab in 2000. Since July 1, 2016 the Texas Historical Commission has operated the site as Mission Dolores State Historic Site. =Mission San Miguel de Linares de los Adaes= Mission San Miguel de Linares de los Adaes was the fifth mission established in East Texas in 1716–1717. The mission was to serve the Native American village of Adaes just west of the French fort at Natchitoches, Louisiana. At that time, the Spanish claimed the Red River as the eastern boundary of Texas, so the mission was considered part of Spanish Texas, despite being in what is now considered Louisiana. The mission was attacked by French soldiers in 1719 and was closed. Three years later, the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo reopened the mission, but at a site closer to the Presidio of Los Adaes. The mission remained open until 1773. =Mission San Antonio de Valero= Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo) Mission San Antonio de Valero was established on May 1, 1718, as the first Spanish mission along the San Antonio River. It was named for San Antonio de Padua, the patron saint of the mission's founder, Father Antonio de Olivares as well as for the viceroy of New Spain, the Marquis de Valero. The mission later became known as the Alamo.Maxwell (1998), p. 24. Its first location was west of San Pedro Springs, and after being moved several times, it was finally established above a bend in the San Antonio River, where it would be easy to defend. The early mission buildings were made of grass, and the first stone building was built in 1727. The building now known as the Alamo was not built until 1744, and most of its actual structure does not remain. The mission eventually grew to include a granary, workhouse, and rooms for the priests, native peoples, and soldiers. To protect from frequent Apache raids, a wall surrounded the buildings. Outside the wall were farmlands and ranches owned by the mission.Maxwell (1998), p. 25. The mission served the Coahuiltecan Native Americans until 1793, when mission activities ended. At that time the land and livestock were divided among the thirty-nine Indians remaining at the mission. The buildings later served as a home for a Mexican army unit before becoming a military hospital in 1806. During the Texas Revolution, the buildings served as the site of the Battle of the Alamo,Maxwell (1998), p. 26. and during the Mexican–American War supplies for the U.S. Army were stored there. The buildings are now owned by the state of Texas and operated as memorial by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.Maxwell (1999), p. 27. =Mission San José y San Miguel de Aguayo= Mission San José y San Miguel de Aguayo Shortly after its founding, Mission San Antonio de Valero became overcrowded with refugees from the closed East Texas missions, and Father Antonio Margil received permission from the governor of Coahuila and Texas, the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo, to build a new mission. On February 23, 1720, the new mission, San José y San Miguel de Aguayo was establishedMaxwell (1998), p. 28. south of San Antonio de Valero. Like San Antonio de Valero, Mission San José served the Coahuiltecan natives. The first buildings, made of brush, straw, and mud, were quickly replaced by large stone structures, including guest rooms, offices, a dining room, and a pantry. A heavy outer wall was built around the main part of the mission, and rooms for 350 Indians were built into the walls.Maxwell (1998), p. 29. A new church, which still stands, was constructed in 1768 from local limestone.Maxwell (1998), p. 30. The mission lands were given to its Indians in 1794, and mission activities officially ended in 1824. After that, the buildings were home to soldiers, the homeless, and bandits. It was restored in the 1930sMaxwell (1998), p. 31. and is now a state and national historic site.Maxwell (1998), p. 32. =Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga= Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga was established in 1749, and referred to as \\"Mission La Bahia\\" *Established in 1722 Matagorda Bay (whence the name \\"La Bahia\\" The Bay) among the Karankawa Indians *Moved in 1726 near Victoria *Moved in 1749 to La Bahia (now Goliad, Texas) *The mission became the first large cattle ranch in Texas, with near 40,000 free roaming cattle at the height of production in about 1778. The large herds of longhorns and mustangs were cared for by the vaquero Indians from the mission. They also grew large crops of grain, fruit and vegetables to support the residents and trade with others. Cattle and livestock were also driven and traded with the other missions in Texas and Louisiana. *Final official secularization in February 1830 *Restored from ruins by the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration in the 1930s *Currently a state historical park operated by the State of Texas Parks and Wildlife Department =Mission San Francisco Xavier de Nájera= Mission San Francisco Xavier de Nájera was established in 1722 in San Antonio, as a result of a promise made by the Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo, the governor of Spanish Texas. The previous year, Aguayo had asked the El Cuilón (also known as Juan Rodriguez) the chief of the Ervipiame and influential among many of the other tribes of Rancheria Grande natives, such as the Yojuanes and the Mayeye to guide him to East Texas to reopen the missions there;Juliana Barr, Peace Came in the Form of a Woman: Indians and Spaniards in the Texas Borderlands (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2007) in return, Aguayo promised to open a mission along the San Antonio River for the chief's tribe. The new mission was established south of San Antonio de Valero and was initially populated by fifty families under the leadership of El Cuilón.Barr, Peace Came in the Form, p. 126 The families did not stay long, and by 1726 the mission closed. Its lands were later given to Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción de Acuña. =Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá= * Established 1757 by the Franciscan Missionaries. * They lived among the Lipan Apache people. * Was the first place that the Spanish and the Comanche went into a conflict. * Destroyed by 2,000 Comanche warriors and their allies in March, 1758. * Even though the mission was gone the neighboring Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas was still running until 1772. =Mission Nuestra Señora del Rosario= *Established 1754 4 miles west of La Bahia to serve various Karankawan tribes. *The mission developed a vast ranching system during its existence. *In 1781 the livestock were transferred to Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga. *Rosario was formally combined with Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio on February 7, 1807. *Rosario was not secularized until 1828, with the order officially executed in 1831. *Currently the ruins are an archaeological site designated as Mission Rosario State Historic Site and controlled by the State of Texas Parks and Wildlife Department as part of Goliad State Park and Historic Site. =Mission San Francisco Xavier de los Dolores= * Established in 1755 by Pedro de Rábago y Terán established the mission * Located on the San Marcos River headwaters in Hays County * The Apache people gathered at this site * Assets transferred to Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá in 1756 =Mission Nuestra Señora de la Luz= *Established 1756 *Located near the mouth of the Trinity River north of Wallisville in Chambers County *Destroyed by the Karankawa natives and relocated farther North. Sickness and Indian attacks forced the mission to relocate farther north, on the Trinity River 40 miles south of Dallas. * This mission then thrived in the cattle and agriculture business It was the 27th mission in Texas. Spain declined in influence in Texas and Mexico took over this mission. The Mexican Roman Catholic diocese of Guanajuato, Mexico took over the mission operations in Texas with a few exceptions. The Mission was isolated from Mexico and began to do trade with the many different groups of Indians, French and Americans. The Fathers of this mission gave the name \\"River of the Most Holy Trinity\\" or 'Rio de la Santisma Trinidad\\" to the Trinity river. =Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio= *Established February 4, 1793, in East Texas *Moved in June, 1794 Mosquitos Creek *Moved in January, 1795 to Refugio *On January 7, 1830, the official secularization order was finally executed and Refugio was abandoned. *Materials from ruins probably used to build new structures in the early 19th century.

Leichte Infanterie Division) was a light infantry division of the German Army during World War II. As such, it was provided with partial horse or motor transport and lighter artillery. Light divisions were reduced in size compared to standard infantry divisions. The Walloon Legion was briefly attached to this division from January 1942 to May 1942. During the latter stages of the war, the division was composed of members from most of Germany's geographic areas and many German-speaking Walloons (Belgian/French). Background left The main purpose of the German Jäger Divisions was to fight in adverse terrain where smaller, coordinated formations were more facilely combat capable than the brute force offered by their standard infantry counterparts. The Jäger divisions were more heavily equipped than the mountain Gebirgsjäger equivalents, but not as well armed as a larger infantry division. In the early stages of the war, it was the interface divisions fighting in rough terrain and foothills as well as urban areas, between the mountains and the plains. The Jägers (means \\"hunters\\" in German) relied on a high degree of training, and slightly superior communications, as well as their not inconsiderable artillery support. In the middle stages of the war, as the standard infantry divisions were downsized, the Jäger structure of divisions with two infantry regiments, became the standard table of organization. In 1944, Adolf Hitler declared that all infantry divisions were now Volksgrenadier Divisions except for his elite Jäger and Mountain Jäger divisions. Operational history Initially established in December 1940 as the 100th Light Infantry Division, the unit was raised in Upper Austria, and based in Ried. The 54th Jäger Regiment was detached from the 18th Infantry. The division comprised two- thirds Austrian and one-third Silesian men. The 100th Light Infantry Division's first campaign as a fighting force was Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, where it served with the 17th Army in the Southern Sector. Its first campaign was in the Battle of Uman, followed by action at Kiev and Odessa. In October, the 369th Reinforced Croatian Infantry Regiment was attached to the division to bolster its size when attacking the Eastern Front. The formation was the only German Jäger Division that fought at the Battle of Stalingrad. The 100th Light Infantry Division, along with the 369th Reinforced Croatian Infantry Regiment, was virtually destroyed at Stalingrad. The 100th Jäger Division was reestablished and fought partisans in the Balkans, Croatia, Albania, and was deployed on coastal protection duties in the Strait of Otranto.

In newspaper reporting, many Africans have won international media awards. In writing both prose and poetry, many awards have also been won by Africans, and Africa now claims a Nobel Laureate in Literature, Prof. Wole Soyinka of Nigeria. History In 1794 the first printing press arrived in Africa delivered to Freetown, Sierra Leone, but was destroyed by a French raiding party before it was ever used. When another press arrived in 1800 the newspaper the Sierra Leone Advertiser began being printed. Communications Advances in satellite communication, and its availability in Africa (some countries on the continent have their own communications satellites) has meant that some local television stations are now viewed outside their terrestrial broadcast areas. Submarine fibre cables are gradually changing the face of communications in Africa and bringing faster and more reliable Internet connectivity to most countries on the continent. The challenge is to continue the advance of fibre inland. Much of the fibre being laid is without redundancy, so it is great when it works, but there is always the concern that you need satellite back up. VSAT Providers covering Africa Onlime GmbH (www.onlime.com) Digital media and internet Digital media and internet are increasingly part of the African media landscape. One specific development worth mentioning, is the rise of mobile reporting. Journalists across the continent are increasingly using the mobile phone as their primary reporting tool needed to collect text, photo and video. This content is often distributed via the internet and is an early example of convergence in the internet and mobile medium. Pan African community based websites are also emerging on the scene and reflect trends in the Web 2.0 movement seen in other parts of the world. Television A 24-hour pan-African news and information channel called A24 will start broadcasting from Nairobi in 2008 by satellite and the internet. Print media Historically, Nigeria has boasted one of the most free and resilient newspaper presses of any African country, even under its past military dictatorships, most of whom have shown an intolerance of the press. In the rest of the continent, vibrant journalism is also getting to be the order of the day. As in more developed countries, many journalists, in a bid to uphold the integrity of the profession, have preferred to go to jail rather than betray the confidentiality of a source. In 2005, journalists representing 23 African nations met in Cameroon and established the Society for the Development of Media in Africa (Société pour le Développement des Médias Africains, SDMA).

The character first appeared in Brave and the Bold #28 (February–March 1960), and was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky. Starro is the first villain to face the original Justice League of America. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has appeared in both comic books and other DC Comics-related products, such as animated television series and videogames. Publication history The character debuted in The Brave and the Bold #28 (Feb.-March 1960) in a story titled \\"Starro the Conqueror\\", which was also the first appearance of the Justice League of America. According to editor Julius Schwartz, the title “Starro the Conqueror\\" was inspired by a Ray Cumming’s story, \\"Tarrano the Conqueror\\". The second appearance of Starro was an 11-page Aquaman story in Adventure Comics #451 (May–June 1977), later a third appearance in a two-part story in Justice League of America #189–190 (April–May 1981). The character returned in an alternate universe story in Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! #1 (March 1982) and appeared briefly in Crisis on Infinite Earths #9 (Dec. 1985). In the post-Crisis DC universe, Starro appeared in a five-part story in Justice League Europe #24–28 (March–July 1991) and was revamped and reintroduced in JLA Secret Files #1 (Sept. 1997) and JLA #22–23 (Sept. – Oct. 1998). Another version featured in the intercompany crossover JLA/Avengers #1–4 (Sept. 2003 – May 2004); Teen Titans vol. 3, #51–54 (Nov. 2007 – Feb. 2008) and Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps: Secret Files #1 (Feb. 2008) and Booster Gold #13–14 (Dec. 2008 – Jan. 2009). In post-Infinite Crisis DC continuity, the character appeared in R.E.B.E.L.S #1–13 (April 2009 – April 2010) and R.E.B.E.L.S Annual #1 (Dec. 2009). Another version appears in Forever Evil #1 (Nov. 2013). and a version called a \\"Genetically Modified Starro\\" appeared in New Super-Man #4 in 2016. Fictional character biography Starro is an intelligent alien lifeform resembling a giant starfish with a central eye and prehensile extremities. The entity visited Earth and empowered three starfish, the creatures wreaking havoc (exploding an atom bomb and absorbing its energy; kidnapping scientists and absorbing their brain power and placing the residents of Happy Harbor and Rhode Island under mental control) until stopped by heroes Aquaman, Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Martian Manhunter, and Wonder Woman. Starro was defeated by coating it with quicklime, which nullified the entity's abilities.Brave and the Bold #28 (Feb.-March 1960) A segment of that Starro survived, and regenerated into a complete creature, but was stopped by Aquaman before being able to renew its plan of conquest.Adventure Comics #451 (May–June 1977) Starro eventually reappeared, and forced humans to nurture it until it was able to assume its former proportions. Being able to asexually spawn, Starro created millions of miniature duplicate \\"spores\\" of itself, which attached to the faces of the entire population of New York and rendered them under his mental control. Starro used these spores to control several members of the Justice League until defeated by extreme cold.Justice League of America #189–190 (April–May 1981) When Superman investigates a strange phenomenon causing the citizens of Metropolis to begin acting like apes, he is accidentally transported to an alternate universe and arrives on the parallel Earth called Earth-C. Meeting sentient superpowered animals called Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew, Superman aids the animal heroes to defeat Starro, who has established a base on the Earth-C universe's version of the planet Pluto. Superman then takes the defeated Starro back to his universe.Captain Carrot & His Amazing Zoo Crew #1 (March 1982) Starro later convinces Justice League Europe that it is dying and wishes to return to space. Aided by ex-Green Lantern Kilowog, Starro returns to his original ship, which, once repaired, is launched out of Earth's atmosphere. Starro, however, betrays the Justice League when it programs the vessel to explode, freeing Starro from its body and releasing thousands of smaller \\"spore\\" versions over Western Europe. Assuming control of thousands of humans, Starro seizes power, with several members of Justice League Europe opposing the alien. Starro is finally defeated when Justice League member Ice freezes the original creature.Justice League Europe #24–28 (March–July 1991) Referring to itself only as \\"It\\", a different version of Starro takes control of the Flash (Wally West) and the population of Blue Valley using spores. Although the JLA intend to intervene, they are advised against doing so by the Spectre (Hal Jordan), who reveals the alien's intention is to capture and control the heroes and use them to form an army to conquer the galaxy. The JLA request the Spectre temporarily remove their powers—thus eliminating the potential threat they may pose—allowing them to distract the entity while Batman disables it with extreme cold.JLA Secret Files #1 (Sept. 1997) This version returns and is revealed to be a scout for a huge version of the creature called the \\"Star Conqueror\\". Covering Europe with its body, the entity psychically enslaves the human race while they sleep. Dream of the Endless aids the JLA, with several members battling the entity in the dreamworld whilst another small team is attacking its physical form. Assisted by a homeless man resisting the entity's control, the heroes free mankind from the alien's influence. Dream captures the Star Conqueror and stores the entity with his other keepsakes.JLA #22–23 (Sept. – Oct. 1998) In the DC/Marvel Comics crossover JLA/Avengers, Starro battles the alternate universe superhero team the Avengers.JLA/Avengers #1–4 (Sept. 2003 – May 2004) During the Infinite Crisis, Starro appears as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains.Infinite Crisis #7 (June 2006) Starro eventually returns to Earth-C (now called Earth-26) to spark a conflict between aquatic and terrestrial creatures. Despite the efforts of the Zoo Crew, Starro floods the planet and defeats the team. They are then transported off world with the surviving refugees by another animal team, Just'a Lotta Animals. Zoo Crew member Pig Iron apparently sacrifices himself and battles Starro underwater as they escape.Captain Carrot and the Final Ark (Oct. 2007) Starro reappears as a member of the Sinestro Corps, wielding five power rings and controlling several supervillains. The entity is destroyed by a future version of the Flash (Bart Allen).Teen Titans vol. 3, #51–54 (Nov. 2007 – Feb. 2008); Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps: Secret Files (Feb. 2008) It is eventually revealed that Starro belonged to a race of parasites that conquered planets with \\"motherstars\\" that released spores to take mental control of a population. When a motherstar arrived on the planet Hatorei and enslaved its psychically gifted native humanoids, a sole survivor takes control of an infant Starro queen, allowing him to mentally dominate the entire parasitic race. Assuming the name \\"Starro the Conqueror\\" the being is empowered by a huge army of drone soldiers controlled by spores, allowing him to conquer entire galaxies.R.E.B.E.L.S #1–13 (April 2009 – April 2010) A human possessed by Starro is later seen amongst the villains recruited in the Secret Society.Forever Evil #1 (Nov. 2013) =Jarro= The Prime Earth version of Starro is recruited to join Team MysteryDC Nation #0 (July 2018) to protect the universe against the Omega Titans. Convinced of the virtues of heroism by his teammate Martian Manhunter, Starro dies in battle with the Omega Titans Justice League: No Justice #3 (July 2018). Batman preserves a tissue sample which grows into a new individual who Batman dubs 'Jarro'Justice League #10 (December 2018), raising him as a son and even taking him on as a new Robin.Justice League #29 (October 2019) Other versions =Future version= A future version of Starro mentally enthralls the Time Master Rip Hunter, using his time-travelling technology to retroactively conquer Earth. With the assistance of the villain Lady Chronos, hero Booster Gold is able to restore the timeline.Booster Gold #13–14 (Dec. 2008 – Jan. 2009) =\\"Titans Tomorrow\\"= At another point in a future time, a giant Starro spore had been indoctrinated into the Sinestro Corps, wielding five yellow power rings and hosting a number of supervillains pertaining to Livewire, Prometheus and Brimstone among others opposing the \\"Titans Tomorrows\\" past counterparts.Teen Titans vol. 3 #51-54 Powers and abilities Starro is an alien amalgamate conqueror with both a humanoid central mind commanding spores which resemble either giant or small terran starfish. An asexual creature, Starro's spores are capable of generating clones that act in accordance with the original's will. The clones are parasites by nature, and can attach themselves to a humanoid's face, and subsequently take control of the host's central nervous system, thereby controlling the host. Control of the host is lost once removed from the victim. Both variants of the parasite are capable of energy absorption/projection; flight; changing color and self regeneration while the larger ones have a high degree of invulnerability, the giant versions also have much more potent mental capabilities being able to indirectly influence the minds of a potential host race, capable of lulling countless people into an induced slumber and accessing their thoughts via dreams. Their size can also vary from being as big as city blocks to larger than a small planetary ocean body, in which case said Starro probe can radically alter the very climate, topography and geography within their vicinity akin to terraforming. A future Starr conqueror spore eventually comes to weaponize 5 Qwardian power rings on each of its pointed tentacles, the ring can create objects based on the wielder's thoughts but only those fuelled by fear instead of willpower. Given the difficulty in their usage the starro's capacity to use five at once indicates a mastery of the fear element and its usage in battle, as shown when he personally went up against multiple iterations of titans all at once.Teen Titans vol. 3 #53 The humanoid \\"Starro the Conqueror\\" possesses telepathy strong enough to control the entire Starro alien race, and possesses immeasurable levels of physical resilience further bolstered by the energies drawn from the victims of his Starro probes. Being physically strong enough to behead the all but invulnerable Despero in single combat, Starro the Conqueror is all but impervious to physical harm much like his larger Starro clones; also akin to said spores the humanoid Starro can reproduce its own Starro clones from the mother Starro on his chest; a unique power of his own making is the ability to convert normal Earth-based starfish into Starro-based spores. In other media =Television= Live action * Starro is alluded to in Smallville. In the season ten episode \\"Prophecy\\", a mind control device created by Marionette Ventures is used the device to control Stargirl and later by the Toyman himself to make Lois Lane attack and kill The Blur. * Starro is alluded to on Arrow. He is seen on a shirt in the episode \\"The Secret Origin of Felicity Smoak\\"; his pose is very similar to his pose on the cover of his first appearance. * Starro makes a cameo in the first episode of Powerless. * Starro is alluded to in The Flash. Wally West mentions in the episode \\"Therefore I Am\\" having battled Starro in Blue Valley. Starro is also mentioned in the episode \\"Subject 9\\" on Izzy Bowin’s website. His species is also alluded to in the episode \\"The Exorcism of Nash Wells\\" by Eobard Thawne (masquerading as Wells). Animation * Starro appeared in an episode of The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure. * Starro appeared in multiple series in the DCAU. ** Starro made a cameo appearance in Superman: The Animated Series. It was seen in the episode \\"The Main Man\\" as one of the creatures held in the Galactic Preserver's private zoo. After the Preserver's demise by Superman and Lobo, Superman takes Starro (along with a host of other alien species) back to the Fortress of Solitude to reside there unaware of the creature's malevolent nature. ** Starro is subsequently seen in Batman Beyond, voiced by Christopher McDonald (via Superman). The two-part episode \\"The Call\\" showed that Starro had ambushed Superman from his enclosure in the Fortress of Solitude as an ideal host. Having been plotting during all its years in captivity, the creature via Superman wanted to establish a new homeworld for its species and spent the next several years to try to dismantle the Justice League. Thanks to Batman, Starro is defeated and sent back to his home planet by Aquagirl and Big Barda. * Starro has appearances in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson (original form) and by Dee Bradley Baker (Starro Titan). It is seen in the episodes \\"Revenge of the Reach!\\", \\"Clash of the Metal Men!\\", \\"The Power of Shazam!\\" and \\"The Siege of Starro!\\" [Parts One and Two]. Starro appears as the main antagonist of the show's second season. Starro makes his first appearance when his clones take control over the Challengers of the Unknown at the beginning of the episode \\"Revenge of the Reach!\\" Starro's clones later appear in several other episodes, attacking and taking control of various heroes with assistance from the Faceless Hunter as herald. The real Starro finally appears in the two-part \\"The Siege of Starro!\\" story, where it has successfully captured and taken control of most of Earth's superheroes. A small resistance cell is formed by the few heroes not controlled by Starro, consisting of Batman, Booster Gold, Firestorm, B'wana Beast and Captain Marvel. B'wana Beast's ultimate sacrifice destroys Starro once and for all. * Starro has made appearances in the Young Justice animated series. Starro (though it is never explicitly named as such) appears in the episode \\"Downtime\\" where it is discovered frozen in ice by a group of Atlantean scientists. Black Manta leads his crew of mercenaries on a mission to steal Starro from Doctor Vulko's lab, but the plan is thwarted by the intervention of Aqualad and Garth. As a last resort, Black Manta destroys Starro before it can be unfrozen, but a small sample of the creature is later recovered and sent to S.T.A.R. Labs to be studied. It is mentioned that the sample is regenerating itself, implying the creature is still alive despite having been frozen for thousands of years. In the episode \\"Misplaced\\", Sportsmaster and the Riddler steal the sample from S.T.A.R. Labs. In the episode \\"Insecurity\\", Professor Ivo, the Brain and Klarion the Witch Boy set to work creating a series of spores from the Starro sample, infused with both technology and magic. In the episode \\"Usual Suspects\\", Red Arrow (who is revealed to be an unwilling traitor) uses the Starro spores to infect the Justice League, bringing the group under Vandal Savage's control. Though the Team saves the League, Savage was able to use six of the League's strongest members for a planned attack on the planet Rimbor. The third season Outsiders revealed that Starro is not the only one of his species, all sharing a desire to conquer and control living beings. The one frozen in ice had come to Earth and tried to conquer near the beginning of human history, but was stopped by Savage. In the present, another attempts to conquer Earth by using its power to form an immensely large warfleet. Determining Earth's heroes would be unable to deal with the situation, Savage personally led the attack against what Savage would find to be an ancient enemy, and killed the new version. * Starro appears during Robot Chicken DC Comics Special 2: Villains in Paradise, voiced by Kevin Shinick. It appears as a pint-sized member of Lex Luthor's Legion of Doom, but is quickly flushed down the toilet by Captain Cold. Later in the special, Starro reappears, having grown to ginormous proportions thanks to the radioactive sewage, and fights the Justice League and the Legion of Doom. Upon seeing the love between Superboy and Lena Luthor, Starro reconsiders massacring his opponents but is killed by Batman riding a boat made by Green Lantern. * Starro appears in the TV version of DC Super Hero Girls. =Film= Starro makes cameo appearances in Justice League: The New Frontier (2008), Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths (2010) and Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013). =Video games= * Starro appears as a boss in the Nintendo Wii version of Batman: The Brave and the Bold – The Videogame. * Starro makes a cameo appearance in Injustice: Gods Among Us; his spherical prison cell the Fortress of Solitude stage can be used as a jumping- off point for Speed-type characters and can be thrown at the enemy by Power- type characters, making the sphere break and Starro quietly escape. * Starro is a playable character in Infinite Crisis, voiced by Mark Rolston. * Starro makes a cameo appearance in Batman: Arkham Knight. Featured in the DLC mission \\"A Matter of Family\\", Starro can be found in an aquarium tank under the stairway connecting the north and south parts of the park.

It was syndicated by the McNaught Syndicate from 1922 until the end of its run.  Publication history  Comics historian Don Markstein traced the history of the strip:  Story and characters  Boob McNutt was a clumsy, buffoonish fellow who was quite friendly and attempted to be helpful in his incompetent way. He was entrusted with tasks like caring for priceless works of art and the Elixir of Immortality, tasks in which he inevitably failed, usually in a destructive manner. From 1922 to 1926, the strip focused on Boob's pursuit of his true love Pearl, whom he finally married, then divorced, then married again and divorced again. Goldberg inserted supporting characters from his other strips, including Mike and Ike (They Look Alike) and Bertha the Siberian Cheesehound. In 1934, he even brought in Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, inventor of those famed Rube Goldberg machines, for a brief sojourn before the strip was cancelled. The strip had several Sunday toppers over the course of its run, including: Bertha the Siberian Cheesehound (Jan 10-July 4, 1926), Bill and Professor Butts (July 11, 1926 - Sept 23, 1934), Boob McNutt's Ark (Jan 8, 1933 - Feb 4, 1934), Are You Saving Jokers? (Feb 11-May 13, 1934) and Boob McNutt's Geography (May 20-Sept 23, 1934).  Legacy  In his seminal 1923 essay, \\"The Seven Lively Arts\\", Gilbert Seldes called Boob McNutt \\"the least worthy of Rube Goldberg's astonishing creations\\". Boob was vindicated, however, when he was featured on the front cover of Nemo #24. References Sources * Strickler, Dave. Syndicated Comic Strips and Artists, 1924-1995: The Complete Index.

Rail and barge routes shown on the map are largely the same as those in use a century later. New York New Jersey Rail, LLC is a switching and terminal railroadAssociation of American Railroads, About the Industry: Railroads and States , 2006, accessed December 2008 that operates the only car float operation across Upper New York Bay between Jersey City, New Jersey and Brooklyn, New York. Since mid-November 2008, it has been owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which acquired it for about $16 million as a step in a process that might see a Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel completed. Since freight trains are not allowed in Amtrak's North River Tunnels, and the Poughkeepsie Bridge was closed in 1974, the ferry is the only freight crossing of the Hudson River south of the Alfred H. Smith Memorial Bridge, to the north of New York City, in a process known as the Selkirk hurdle. It is the last remaining car float operation in the Port of New York and New Jersey. Operations NYNJ leases approximately of land at Conrail's Greenville Yard in Greenville, Jersey City, where it connects with Class I railroads CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway, which jointly operate Conrail's North Jersey Shared Assets Area. On the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn end, the Bush Terminal Yard and the 65th Street Yard connect to the Long Island Rail Road's freight-only Bay Ridge Branch, which is operated by the New York and Atlantic Railway, and the New York City Transit Authority's South Brooklyn Railway. The 2.5 mile barge trip across the harbor takes approximately 45 minutes. The equivalent trip by truck is 35-50 miles.NYRR 10-K SEC filing for 2003 As of 2012, the NYNJ system moves approximately 1,500 rail cars across the harbor per year. Port Authority officials suggested that the system can transport as many as 25,000 cars annually.NJTPA Freight Committee, October 2012 NYNJ replaced two EMD GP38-2 with three low-emission locomotives from Knoxville Locomotive Works in Tennessee for $5 million. As of July 2015, the system had moved about 4900 rail cars year-to-date. History From 1983 to 2006, the operation was known as the New York Cross Harbor Railroad . Earlier predecessors include the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal Company, Bush Terminal Railroad, New York Dock Railway, and New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad operations at Bay Ridge and Greenville. In 1999 the city of New York rehabilitated the larger 65th Street Yard for car float operations with two lift bridges. It was not turned over to NYCH because of a dispute over money owed the city. NYCH continued to use the single lift bridge at Bush Terminal instead. In 2002, New York Cross Harbor Railroad revenues from railroad operations were $1,685,899. It had 48 active customers, with shipments of cocoa from docks in Brooklyn as its largest line of business. It also operated a trucking service and offered shipside and dockside service for receipt or delivery of various types of cargo, such as oversized steel beams. NYCH ceased to exist in 2006; a new company, Mid-Atlantic New England Rail, LLC of West Seneca, New York, bought the railroad and renamed it New York New Jersey Rail, LLC (NYNJ). The city of New York purchased the company two years later. The Port Authority began working with government agencies in New York and New Jersey to bring NYNJ to a state of good repair. This includes emergency work to stabilize the transfer bridge structure in Greenville, repairs to the float bridge and track infrastructure in Brooklyn, and procurement of ultra-low emissions locomotives and a new 30-car rail barge. In May 2010 the Port Authority announced that it would purchase Greenville Yard and build a new barge-to-rail facility there, as well as improving the existing rail car float system. The barge-to-rail facility is expected to handle an estimated 60,000 to 90,000 containers of solid waste per year from New York City, eliminating up to 360,000 trash truck trips a year. The authority's board authorized $118.1 million for the overall project. In November 2011 the Port Authority hired HDR, Inc. of Omaha, Nebraska to rehabilitate Greenville Yard. Work included rehabilitating the railyard and waterfront structures, including a rail barge and transfer bridge, demolishing two other bridges, designing a new barge and two new bridges, and adding 10,000 feet of track. In July 2012 NYNJ began operating out of the 65th Street Yard. Initial cargo included apples, home heating oil, new automobiles, and scrap metal. The railroad north along First Avenue was refurbished and new tracks laid to support operations at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, including an automobile import pier and a new municipal recycling plant. On October 29, 2012 Hurricane Sandy caused major damage to the Greenville facility, undermining the float bridge gantries and sinking one of the car floats. The 81-year-old gantry structures were ultimately demolished. The working float bridge at Bush Terminal was transferred by barge to Greenville, where it was re-designated the Greenville Pontoon Bridge. Service was restored in late December, after 52 days of intensive reconstruction. On September 17, 2014 the Port Authority announced that it was funding a major redevelopment of the Greenville Yard, to include a new ExpressRail container terminal servicing the Port Jersey Global Marine Terminal. The Port Authority would also build two new rail-to-barge transfer bridges, purchase two new car float barges, and buy four new ultra low emission locomotivesPort Authority Board Approves Major Redevelopment Of Greenville Yard To Improve Cargo Movement In The Port, Port Authority Press Release Number 190-2014, September 17, 2014New York-area port authority to build rail transload facility, improve cross-harbor car float system, Progressive Railroading, September 18, 2014 In November 2017, the first of the new barges, NYNJR100, was delivered to NYNJ. Built by Metal Trades, Inc., the four-track barge can carry up to 18 rail cars of length, with up to 2,298 long tons (2,335 tonne) of cargo. The second barge, NYNJR200, was delivered in December 2018. An older, 14-car barge, the 278, is still in service. The new ExpressRail container terminal opened January 7, 2019, with four tracks out of eight operational. The remaining four tracks were opened on June 17, 2019. In July 2017, the Port Authority announced a $35 million study to build a Cross- Harbor Rail Tunnel, suitable for freight. If built, the tunnel would eliminate the need for the NYNJ ferry.

Known for their rambunctious live shows, technically proficient horn solos and tight arrangements, the Scofflaws were one of the top third wave ska acts of the '90s and one of the most beloved bands on the now-defunct Moon Ska label, as well as the center and focal point of the once-thriving Long Island ska scene. History The band originally performed as the New Bohemians, initially with a stronger emphasis on novelty '60s, R&B; and TV-show theme cover songs, bolstered by original ska-oriented anthems such as \\"Rudy's Back\\" and \\"Paul Getty\\". In 1988, they sold the New Bohemians name to Geffen Records (who had just signed Edie Brickell & New Bohemians), and regrouped as the Scofflaws. The Scofflaws early sound was characterized by strong R&B; and jazz influences as well as eclectic covers of such songs as Henry Mancini's \\"A Shot in the Dark\\", Danny Elfman's theme for Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Sergio Leone's \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" theme and the Skatalites instrumental \\"Ska-La Parisian\\". Original songs like \\"Ska- La-Carte\\", \\"Nude Beach\\" and \\"William Shatner\\" became cult favorites due to the offbeat lyrics and quirky vocal stylings of bandleader Richard \\"Sammy\\" Brooks and trombonist Buford O'Sullivan. Their self-titled debut studio album was released in 1991 by Moon Records, followed by Ska in Hi Fi in 1995, the concert recording Live! Vol. 1 in 1996, and their third studio album, Record of Convictions, in 1998. They toured the United States several times, including stints as the openers for Desmond Dekker and Bad Manners. In addition, they toured Europe in 1998 supporting Laurel Aitken. The band's lineup saw frequent changes and served as a springboard for numerous New York ska musicians, as well as sprouting several spinoff groups. Original co- frontman Mike Drance left in 1994 to form the Bluebeats, while bassist Victor Rice went on to be a founding member of the New York Ska-Jazz Ensemble and continue a career in music production. Several Scofflaws members including O'Sullivan, Paul Gebhardt and Tony Calarco also played for fellow Moon Ska artists the Toasters as well as One Groovy Coconut and Royal Roost, and the Scofflaws have often shared members with fellow Huntington band Spider Nick & the Maddogs (whose leader, \\"Spider Nick\\" Martielli, composed Scofflaws favorite \\"Spider on My Bed\\"). Although the Scofflaws have not released a studio recording since 1998, Brooks continues to lead the band in live performances within the New York area.

Karagatsis (; 23 June 1908 – 14 September 1960) was the pen name of the important modern Greek novelist, journalist, critic and playwright Dimitris Rodopoulos (Δημήτριος Ροδόπουλος). The pen name M. Karagatsis is the name the novelist is known with. The letter \\"M.\\" comes from Mitya, which is the Russian diminutive of Dimitris (his real name). The word \\"Karagatsis\\" comes from the tree karagatsi under the shadow of which he used to write as a young writer. Karagatsis was born in Athens, grew up in Larissa and Thessaloniki, and studied law in France. He died in Athens. He is associated with the \\"Generation of the '30s\\".M. Vitti, Η γενιά του τριάντα – Ιδεολογία και μορφή [The Generation of the '30s – Ideology and Form], Ermis, Athens, 1977. Evaluation Karagatsis has been characterized as primarily a prose writer of the illusory reality of persons and situations. His writing is bold, sensual, with great imagination and a unique narrative style, and is often studied by Greek students. His first three novels (Colonel Liapkin, Chimaera and Junkermann) compose a trilogy named Acclimazation under Apollo, about foreigners who live and work in Greece. Karagatsis sets these books in modern, cosmopolitan Greece, in contrast with the stereotype that Greek life is conservative and countrified. Books Karagatsis is one of the few modern Greek writers to be translated, (mainly in German, but also in English, Italian, French) and his most important works are: *Miss Nitsa ( 1929, short novel awarded by literature magazine Nea Estia) *Colonel Liapkin (1933) (Ο Συνταγματάρχης Λιάπκιν) *Junkermann (1939) (Γιούγκερμαν) *The last days of Junkermann (1940) (Τα στερνά του Γιούγκερμαν) *Lost island (1941) (Χαμένο Νησί) *The ruler of Kastropyrgos (1944) (Ο Κοτζάμπασης του Καστρόπυργου) *Great Sleep (1946) (Ο Μεγάλος Ύπνος) *Bar Eldorado (Stage play, 1946) *Blood lost and gained (1947) (Αίμα χαμένο και κερδισμένο) *Carmen (Stage play, 1948) *History of Greeks (nonfiction, 1952) (Η ιστορία των Ελλήνων) *At God's Hands (1954) *Death and Thodoros (1956) (Ο Θάνατος κι ο Θόδωρος) *Yellow envelope (1957) (Ο Κίτρινος Φάκελος) *Sergios and Vacchos (1959) (Σέργιος και Βάκχος) *The 10 (1960) (unfinished) References External links Further reading * Η μεσοπολεμική πεζογραφία, εκδ.

Mark (Mark Frechette) leaves the meeting after saying he is \\"willing to die, but not of boredom\\" for the cause, which draws criticism from the young white radicals. Following a mass arrest at the campus protest, Mark visits a police station hoping to bail his roommate out of jail. He is told to wait but goes to the lock-up area, asks further about bail for his roommate, is rebuffed, calls out to the arrested students and faculty and is arrested. He gives his name as Karl Marx, which a duty officer types as \\"Carl Marx\\". After he is released from jail, Mark and another friend buy firearms from a Los Angeles gun shop, saying they need them for \\"self-defense\\" to \\"protect our women.\\" In a downtown Los Angeles office building, successful real estate executive Lee Allen (Rod Taylor) reviews a television commercial for Sunny Dunes, a new resort-like real estate development in the desert. Instead of actors or models, the slickly produced commercial features casually dressed, smiling mannequins. In the next scene Allen talks with his associate (G.D. Spradlin) about the greater Los Angeles area's very rapid growth as the two drive through crowded streets. Mark goes to a bloody campus confrontation between students and police. Some students are tear-gassed and at least one is shot. As Mark reaches for a gun in his boot, a Los Angeles policeman is seen being fatally shot, although it is unclear by whom.Canby, Vincent. \\"Screen: Antonioni's 'Zabriskie Point'\\". The New York Times, February 10, 1970. Retrieved: February 2, 2010. Mark flees the campus and rides a city bus to suburban Hawthorne, California where, after failing to buy a sandwich on credit from a local blue-collar delicatessen, he walks to Hawthorne Municipal Airport, steals a small Cessna 210 aircraft and flies into the desert. Meanwhile, Daria (Daria Halprin), \\"a sweet, pot-smoking post-teenybopper of decent inclinations\\", is driving across the desert towards Phoenix in a 1950s-era Buick automobile to meet her boss Lee, who may or may not also be her lover. Along the way Daria is searching for a man who works with \\"emotionally disturbed\\" children from Los Angeles. She finds the young boys near a roadhouse in the Mojave desert but they tease, taunt, and grab at her, boldly asking for \\"a piece of ass\\", to which she asks in reply, \\"Are you sure you'd know what to do with it?\\" Daria flees in her car. While filling its radiator with water, she is spied from the air by Mark, who buzzes her car and then flies only 15 feet over her as she lies face down in the sand. He throws a T-shirt out of the window of the aircraft for her to pick up. Daria goes from upset to curious and smiling during this sequence. They later meet at the desert shack of an old man, where Mark asks her for a lift so he can buy gasoline for the aircraft. The two then wander to Zabriskie Point, where they make love and the site's geological formations seem to come alive in a dusty orgy. Later, a California highway patrolman suspiciously questions Daria. Hidden behind a portable toilet meant for tourists, Mark takes aim at the policeman but Daria stands between the two of them to block this, apparently saving the policeman's life before he drives away. Daria asks Mark if he was the one who killed the cop in Los Angeles. He states that he wanted to, but someone else shot the officer first and that he \\"never got off a shot\\". Returning to the stolen aircraft, they paint it with politically-charged slogans and psychedelic colors. Daria pleads with Mark to travel with her and leave the aircraft but Mark is intent on returning and taking the risks that it involves. He flies back to Los Angeles and lands the plane at the airport in Hawthorne. The police (along with some radio and television reporters) are waiting for him, and patrol cars chase the aircraft down the runway. Instead of stopping, Mark tries to turn the taxiing aircraft around across the grass and is shot to death by one of the policemen. Daria learns about Mark's death on the car radio. She drives to Lee's lavish desert home, \\"a desert Berchtesgaden\\" set high on a rock outcropping near Phoenix, Arizona, where she sees three affluent women sunning themselves and chatting by the swimming pool. She grieves for Mark by drenching herself in the house's architectural waterfall. Lee is deeply immersed in a business meeting having to do with the complex and financially risky Sunny Dunes development. Taking a break, he spots Daria in the house and happily greets her. She goes downstairs alone and finds the guest room that has been set aside for her but after briefly opening the door, she shuts it again. Seeing a young Native American housekeeper in the hallway, Daria leaves silently. She drives off but stops to get out of the car and look back at the house, her own imagination seeing it repeatedly blown apart in billows of orange flame and household items.

Antonioni took this as a thread, with which he could tie together the plot of his next film. After writing many drafts, he hired playwright Sam Shepard to write the script. Shepard, Antonioni, Italian filmmaker Franco Rossetti, Antonioni's frequent collaborator screenwriter Tonino Guerra and Clare Peploe (later to become the wife of Bernardo Bertolucci), worked on the screenplay. Most of the supporting roles were played by a professional cast, including, notably, Rod Taylor,Vagg 2010, p. 144. along with G.D. Spradlin, in one of his early feature film roles, following many appearances on U.S. national television. Paul Fix, a friend and acting coach of John Wayne who had appeared in many of Wayne's films, played the owner of a roadhouse in the Mojave desert. Kathleen Cleaver, a member of the Black Panthers and wife of Eldridge Cleaver, appeared in the documentary-like student meeting scene at the opening of the film. Shooting began in July 1968 in Los Angeles, much of it on location in the wider southern downtown area. Exteriors of the art deco Richfield Tower were shown in a few scenes shot shortly before its demolition in November of that year. Various college campus scenes, excluding the scene of the student meeting, were filmed on location at Contra Costa Community College in San Pablo, California. The production then moved to location shooting at Carefree, Arizona, near Phoenix and from there to Death Valley.\\"Making Zabriskie Point.\\" chainedandperfumed.wordpress.com, November 17, 2009. Retrieved: January 29, 2010. The production rented a Carefree mansion and built a replica of the mansion on the lot of Southwestern Studio in Carefree, Arizona, for the special effect of blowing up the mansion. Location shooting also took place in the Mojave Desert.\\"Notes\\" TCM.com Early film industry publicity reports claimed Antonioni would gather 10,000 extras in the desert for the filming of the lovemaking scene but this never happened. The scene was filmed with dust-covered and highly choreographed actors from The Open Theatre. The United States Department of Justice investigated whether this violated the Mann Act – which forbade the taking of women across state lines for sexual purposes – however, no sex was filmed and no state lines were crossed, given that Death Valley is in California. State officials in Sacramento were also ready to charge Antonioni with \\"immoral conduct, prostitution or debauchery\\" if he staged an actual orgy. FBI officials investigated the film because of Antonioni's political views, and officials in Oakland, California accused the director of staging a real riot for a scene early in the film. During filming, Antonioni was quoted as criticizing the U.S. film industry for financially wasteful production practices, which he found \\"almost immoral\\" compared to the more thrifty approach of Italian studios. Music The soundtrack to Zabriskie Point included music from Pink Floyd, The Youngbloods, Kaleidoscope, Jerry Garcia, Patti Page, Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones, and John Fahey. Roy Orbison wrote and sang the theme song, over the credits, called \\"So Young (Love Theme From \\"Zabriskie Point\\")\\". =Unused music= Richard Wright of Pink Floyd wrote a tune called \\"The Violent Sequence\\" for inclusion in the film.Mabbett 2010 Antonioni rejected the song because it was too subdued and instead synchronized a re-recording of the band's \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\", retitled \\"Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up\\", with the film's violent ending scene. Roger Waters states in Classic Albums - Pink Floyd - Making The Dark Side Of The Moon that while he loved the song, Antonioni said it was \\"too sad\\" and that it reminded him of church. Eventually it was reworked into a new song known as \\"Us and Them\\", which was released on their album The Dark Side of the Moon in 1973. \\"The Violent Sequence\\" remained unreleased until it was included on a 2011 boxed set of Dark Side of the Moon, where it was named \\"Us and them (Richard Wright Demo)\\". Other discarded pieces recorded for the film, by Pink Floyd, were released on a bonus disc with the 1997 CD re-release of the soundtrack album, along with pieces by Jerry Garcia. John Fahey was flown to Rome to record some music for the film, but that was not used.Fahey 2000 pp. 184–185 The accounts of Fahey and others differ.Lowenthal and Fricke 2014, pp. 94–97. However, a portion of his Dance of Death was used in the film. Antonioni visited the band The Doors while they were recording their album L.A. Woman and thought about putting them in the soundtrack. The Doors recorded the song \\"L'America\\" for Zabriskie Point, but it was not used. Mark Frechette was living at Mel Lyman's intentional community at Fort Hill, Boston, Massachusetts at the time he made this film. He and Lyman hoped that the soundtrack would include some of the Americana type music Lyman had recorded with Jim Kweskin and the Jug Band. Frechette left copies of Lyman's newspaper Avatar around the studio and took time to play tapes of the band for the director and explain Lyman's work. When Antonioni seemed oblivious to the perceived importance of Lyman's music, Frechette quit the film, but returned six days later.Felton, David (December 1971 & January 1971)) \\"The Lyman Family's Holy Siege of America\\" (two-part article) originally from Rolling Stone #98, pp. 40–60 and #99, pp. 40–60.

Release Following prolonged publicity and controversy in North America throughout its production, Zabriskie Point had its premiere at Walter Reade's Coronet Theatre in New York City on February 5, 1970, almost four years after Antonioni began pre-production and over a year and a half after shooting began, before being generally released on February 9, 1970. Despite the explicit language and sexual content, the film received an R rating rather than an X, in a shift in the MPAA's policy. Reception Decades after its widely panned 1970 release, Zabriskie Point garnered critical praise for its cinematography. Halprin and Frechette can barely be seen in the left of this scene filmed at Zabriskie Point. The film was panned by most critics and other published commentators of all political stripes, as were the performances of Frechette and Halprin. The New York Times reviewer Vincent Canby called Zabriskie Point \\"a noble artistic impulse short-circuited in a foreign land.\\" Roger Ebert echoed Canby, writing: \\"The director who made Monica Vitti seem so incredibly alone is incapable, in Zabriskie Point, of making his young characters seem even slightly together. Their voices are empty; they have no resonance as human beings. They don't play to each other, but to vague narcissistic conceptions of themselves. They wouldn't even meet were it not for a preposterous Hollywood coincidence.\\" The counterculture audience MGM hoped to draw largely ignored the film during its brief theatrical run and taken altogether the outcome was a notorious box-office bomb. Production expenses were at least $7 million and only $900,000 was made in the domestic release. The film was listed in the 1978 book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. It has been described as \\"the worst film ever made by a director of genius\\" but it \\"is still absolutely watchable because of the magic of Antonioni's eye\\".Craven, Peter. \\"Uneasy moments from master of angst.\\" The Age, A2, May 17, 2008, p. 20. Over 20 years after the film's release, Rolling Stone editor David Fricke wrote that \\"Zabriskie Point was one of the most extraordinary disasters in modern cinematic history.\\"Fricke, David. \\"Zabriskie Point.\\" phinnweb.org. Retrieved: February 3, 2010. It was the only film Antonioni directed in the United States, where in 1994 he was given the Honorary Academy Award \\"in recognition of his place as one of the cinema's master visual stylists.\\" With early 21st-century screenings of pristine wide- screen prints and a later DVD release, Zabriskie Point at last garnered some critical praise, mostly for the stark beauty of its cinematography and innovative use of music in the soundtrack, but opinions about the film were still mixed. Director Stéphane Sednaoui referenced the film in his video for \\"Today\\" by The Smashing Pumpkins, where an ice-cream salesman steals his employer's ice-cream van, escapes to the desert, and colourfully paints the van while couples kiss in the desert.\\"Commentary for \\"Today\\" music video.\\" The Smashing Pumpkins 1991–2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection (Virgin Records), 2001.

Its common name comes from Daniel Giraud Elliot, who first described the species in 1899. Description Elliot's short-tailed shrew is similar in appearance to the closely related southern short-tailed shrew, although slightly larger on average, and was long thought to belong to the same species. It is a heavily built shrew with short legs and tail, and a long, pointed snout with long whiskers. The ears and eyes are both small, the eyelids being permanently closed in some individuals, a feature otherwise unknown among shrews. The fur is velvety in texture, and uniformly colored greyish to brown. Adults range from in total length, including the tail, and weigh . Distribution and habitat Elliot's short-tailed shrew is found in lowland environments with heavy vegetation from southern Iowa and Nebraska in the north to parts of Texas and northern Louisiana in the south, including much of the states of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, and the northeastern corner of Colorado. Two subspecies are currently recognised: * Blarina hylophaga hylophaga - throughout most of range * Blarina hylophaga plumbea - Texas The species inhabits a diverse range of habitats, including grasslands, agricultural land, and woodland. Although it generally prefers well watered environments with plenty of ground litter, it is also known from relatively dry and sandy terrain in Texas and Colorado, often with minimal ground cover. Behavior and diet Like other shrews, this species is insectivorous, its diet consisting primarily of beetles and slugs, along with other insects, spiders, and earthworms. They may also eat a small quantity of plants and fungi, and have been reported to eat North American deermice on occasion. Predators include owls, hawks, snakes, and swift foxes. Elliot's short-tailed shrew is generally a solitary, nocturnal animal, spending the day sleeping in burrows in soft soil or leaf litter. The burrows may contain nests made from grass or leaves, and are surrounded by a network of trackways that the shrew uses while hunting for prey. They have been reported to travel across home ranges of anything from , and to travel mostly around dawn and sunset. Having poor eyesight, they hunt primarily by means of echolocation. They are active throughout the year, and do not hibernate. Reproduction The shrew breeds from early spring to late summer, and may be able to raise two or three litters per in a year. Gestation lasts 21 or 22 days, and results in the birth of four to seven hairless young. The young are weaned, with a full coat of fuzzy hair, by one month of age, not receiving the adult coat until they have reached adult size. Individuals can live for up to two years. Taxonomy and evolution Elliot's short-tailed shrew was originally described as a subspecies of Blarina brevicauda, and was only identified as a separate species in 1981. Genetic analysis to determine its precise relationship to other members of the genus has been ambiguous, with some studies placing it as the closest relative to the southern short-tailed shrew, and others showing it as being basal to the other species. The oldest fossils of the species date from the last Ice Age, and the two subspecies may have diverged as recently as one thousand years ago.

The town was built on coal and oil shale mining, and the paper industries. History Loanhead was a tiny village by about 1599, when it was included on a map of the Lothians. It was granted a charter allowing a weekly market and annual fair in 1669. Coal was mined profitably in the area for Sir John Clerk of Penicuik by 1685. The Springfield paper mill, in the valley of the River North Esk to the south of the town, commenced in 1742, while Polton mill followed in 1750. By 1754 Loanhead was a medium-sized settlement. The limestone industry was a source of employment by the late eighteenth century, the works being at Burdiehouse, about a mile to the northwest. The coal industry continued to expand and by 1874 the town was linked to the railway. Shale was mined between Loanhead and Burdiehouse in the late nineteenth century, from 1880 under the Clippens Oil Company of Paisley. By this time the population had expanded to 3,250. The town was granted burgh status in 1884.Loanhead, Gazetteer for Scotland The North British Railway built a steel lattice girder box viaduct across Bilston Glen in 1892, replacing another which had been designed by Thomas Bouch. The shale mines closed in 1909 because of incoming water from the Edinburgh waterworks aqueducts. Burdiehouse limeworks ceased in 1912, although limestone was mined in the area until 1960. The Polton paper mill closed in 1955. Coal mining continued, with the large Bilston Glen pit being sunk between 1952 and 1961. It was closed in 1989, and the site cleared. Bilston Glen Colliery at one stage produced 1,000,000 tons of coal per annum, and employed 2,300 men. The coal workings stretched from Rosewell to Dalkeith. All coal working ceased following the violent strikes of 1984-1985, when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. The site is now used as an industrial estate. Governance Loanhead is administered by Midlothian Council, and following recent boundary changes lies in the new ward of Midlothian West, served by three Midlothian Councillors. At a local level, the Community Council provides a forum at which local views can be aired. Economy and commerce Straiton Retail Park includes one of only two IKEA stores in Scotland. Proposals have been made for Straiton to be further developed with new facilities including an 8,000 capacity events arena serving Edinburgh. 2 hotels are included in the proposals. The main street, Clerk Street, is busy with traffic and local shoppers. Large stores such as Sainsbury's and Costco are in proximity. A large, modern industrial estate with around 100 different concerns provides a wide range of jobs for local residents. Businesses include MacSweens haggis factory, and Police Scotland's Communications Centre (The Force Communications Centre, or FCC) where all radio traffic and emergency calls are handled. The Pentlands industrial estate was opened in the 1970s, and a number of retail and other businesses trade from the periphery of the town. These were from the likes of Gregg's to the more industrial companies focusing on welding and steel fabrication. Culture, recreation and leisure Loanhead has an annual gala day, also known as \\"Children's Day\\". A book to commemorate the 100th Anniversary was published in 2003. Since 2001, an annual weekend music festival, Loanhead Music Festival, has been staged. This increasingly popular event attracts a wide range of mainly acoustic musicians to the town each June, and features around eight venues. As an offshoot from the Festival, Loanhead Guitar Club meets on Wednesday evenings to provide informal tuition and practice opportunities in guitar and other instruments for over 18's. The Loanhead Miners Club continues to be a major social and community hub for the town, and wide variety of events are run from there. Loanhead Guitar Club meets on Wednesday evenings to provide informal tuition and practice opportunities for over 18's. Several community groups run a variety of clubs including five a side football and Girl Guides. Loanhead has a small but well used and appointed leisure centre anda small library. A small green square in the centre of the town features a memorial to miners killed in the town's coal mines, and large and popular bronze sculpture known as the Coghorn, by Andrew Burton. A small cat originally featured on the tip of the horn, but this was removed by vandals, and is yet to be replaced. A local Palladian mansion, Mavisbank House, built in 1723 but derelict for many years, featured on the BBC television series Restoration in 2004. Education and healthcare The town has three primary schools - Paradykes, St. Margaret's (Catholic) and Loanhead Primary. A new joint campus for St. Margaret's and Loanhead Primary was completed and opened in March 2008. The two schools are on the same site but separate allowing the separation of Roman Catholic and secular education but children are able to mix in a range of activities. Loanhead has a health centre. Transport A new park and ride facility, provides bus service into Edinburgh City Centre, opened in 2009. Loanhead is under a mile from the A720 city by-pass. Twin towns The town is twinned with Harnes in northern France, which also has a strong mining tradition. The town was formerly twinned with Dalum in Denmark, just south of Odense, on the island of Funen. In the 1960s, several exchange visits between the two towns took place, but the twinning formally ceased as a consequence of Dalum being absorbed by the much larger Odense.

During the American Civil War, he was a senior officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded cavalry in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. On September 6, 1863 Marmaduke killed Confederate Brigadier-General Lucius M. Walker in a duel. Major-General Sterling Price ordered Marmaduke's arrest, but suspended the order because of the impending Union advance on Little Rock, Arkansas. Marmaduke never faced a court martial for the duel.  Early life and education John Sappington Marmaduke was born on March 14, 1833, in Saline County, Missouri, the second son of ten children.Shoemaker's pp. 189–190 His father, Meredith M. Marmaduke (1791-1864), served as the 8th governor of Missouri, succeeding to office after the suicide of his predecessor. The family was quite political, and Marmaduke's great-grandfather, John Breathitt, had served as the governor of Kentucky from 1832 to 1834, dying in office.Parrish's pp. 16–17 Marmaduke attended Chapel Hill Academy in Lafayette County, Missouri and Masonic College in Lexington, Missouri, before attending Yale University for two years and then Harvard University for another year. U.S. Representative John S. Phelps appointed Marmaduke to the United States Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1857, placing 30th out of 38 students.Welsh's pp. 154 He served as a second lieutenant in the 1st United States Mounted Riflemen, before being transferred to the 2d United States Cavalry under Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston. Marmaduke later served in the Utah War and was posted to Camp Floyd, Utah, in 1858-1860.  American Civil War  John S. Marmaduke in uniform Marmaduke was on duty in the New Mexico Territory in the spring of 1861 when he received news that Missouri had seceded from the Union. He returned home to meet with his father, a strong Unionist. Afterwards, Marmaduke decided to resign from the United States Army, effective April 1861. Pro-secession Missouri Governor Claiborne F. Jackson, Marmaduke's uncle, soon appointed him as the colonel of the 1st Regiment of Rifles, a unit from Saline County, Missouri, in the Missouri State Guard. Governor Jackson departed Jefferson City, Missouri in June, along with State Guard commander Major-General Sterling Price, to recruit more troops. Marmaduke and his regiment met them at Boonville, Missouri. Within a short time, Price and Jackson left, leaving Marmaduke in charge of a small force of militia. Marmaduke realized his troops were not adequately prepared for combat, but Governor Jackson ordered him to make a stand against Union forces who had entered the state. Federal Brigadier-General Nathaniel Lyon's 1,700 well-trained and equipped soldiers easily routed Marmaduke's untrained and poorly armed force at the Battle of Boonville on June 17, 1861. The skirmish was mockingly dubbed \\"the Boonville Races\\" by Unionists, since Marmaduke's recruits broke and ran after 20 minutes of battle. Disgusted by the situation, Marmaduke resigned his commission in the Missouri State Guard and traveled to Richmond, Virginia, where he was commissioned a first lieutenant in the regular Confederate States Army. The Confederate War Department ordered him to report for duty in Arkansas, where he soon was elected lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Arkansas Battalion. He served on the staff of Lieutenant-General William J. Hardee, a former United States Military Academy instructor of infantry tactics. Marmaduke's former Mormon War commander, Albert Sidney Johnston, asked him to join his staff in early 1862.Johnston's pp. 583–584 Marmaduke was wounded in action at the Battle of Shiloh as colonel of the 3rd Confederate Regiment, incapacitating him for several months.Neal's pp. 142–143 In November 1862, the War Department confirmed Marmaduke's promotion to brigadier-general. His first battle as a brigade commander was at the Battle of Prairie Grove.Black's pp. 159 In April 1863, Marmaduke departed Arkansas with 5,000 men and ten artillery pieces and entered Union-held Missouri. However, he was repulsed at the Battle of Cape Girardeau and forced to return to Helena, Arkansas.Conard's pp. 199–200 Controversy soon followed. In September 1863, he accused his immediate superior officer, Brigadier-General Lucius M. Walker, of cowardice in action for not being present with his men on the battlefield. Walker, slighted by the insult, challenged Marmaduke to a duel, which resulted in Walker's death on September 6, 1863. Marmaduke later commanded a cavalry division in the Trans-Mississippi Department, serving in the Red River Campaign. During this period, he once again was involved in controversy. Commanding a mixed force of Confederate troops, including Native- American soldiers of the 1st and 2nd Choctaw Regiments, Marmaduke defeated a Union foraging detachment at the Battle of Poison Spring, Arkansas on April 18, 1864. Marmaduke's men were accused of murdering African-American soldiers of the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteer Infantry (later designated the 79th U.S. Colored Infantry). Marmaduke and other white officers claimed that the accusations of illegal killings were overblown, and blamed any murders that may have happened on the Choctaw troops who, in the words of one Confederate, did \\"kill and scalp some\\" of the black troops. He was hailed in the Confederate press for what was publicized as a significant southern victory. Marmaduke commanded a division in Major-General Sterling Price's Raid September–October 1864 into Missouri, where Marmaduke was captured at the Battle of Mine Creek in Kansas (by Private James Dunlavy of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry). While still a prisoner of war at Johnson's Island in Ohio, Marmaduke was promoted to major-general in March 1865. He was released after the war ended. His younger brother, Henry Hungerford Marmaduke, served in the Confederate States Navy, was captured and was imprisoned on Johnson's Island. He later served the federal government in negotiations with South American nations. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Two other Marmaduke brothers died in the American Civil War.  Later life and death  Marmaduke returned home to Missouri and settled in Carondelet, St. Louis. He worked briefly for an insurance company, whose ethics he found contrary to his own. He then edited an agricultural journal, and publicly accused the railroads of discriminatory pricing against local farmers. The governor soon appointed Marmaduke to the state's first Rail Commission.Reavis's pp. 510–511 Marmaduke decided to enter politics, but lost the 1880 Democratic nomination for governor to former Union general Thomas T. Crittenden, who had strong support and financial backing from the railroads. Undeterred, Marmaduke ran again for governor four years later, at a time when public opinion had changed, and railroad reform and regulation became more in vogue. Marmaduke conducted a campaign which apologetically highlighted his Confederate service, emphasized alleged abuses of Missourians by Union troops during the Civil War, celebrated the activities of pro-Confederate \\"partisan guerrillas\\" such as William Clarke Quantrill, claimed that the Republican Party in Missouri was a tool of \\"carpetbaggers\\" to oppress \\"native\\" Missourians, and made overt appeals to white racism. He was elected on a platform officially focused on cooperation between former Unionists and Confederates, promising an agenda which would produce a \\"New Missouri.\\" He settled potentially crippling railroad strikes in 1885 and 1886. The following year, Marmaduke pushed laws through the state legislature that finally began regulating the state's railway industry. He also dramatically boosted the state's funding of public schools, with nearly a third of the annual budget allocated to education. Marmaduke never married, and his two nieces served as hostesses at the governor's mansion.McClure pp. 175–176 Like his great-grandfather, he died while serving as governor. He contracted pneumonia late in 1887 and died in Jefferson City, Missouri, where he was buried in Woodland Cemetery.

Gordon later died of the infection caused by the wound. McCulloch was found guilty and sentenced to death. Although he initially escaped to France, he was captured when he returned to Edinburgh in 1697 and beheaded at the Mercat Cross. McCulloch had been living in Scotland since 1694 under the alias \\"Mr. Johnstoune\\". He was the last man to be executed on the Maiden. Following his death, much of his family emigrated to America, and Cardoness Castle, which had been owned by the family since c. 1470, was abandoned. =Legend= There is also a legend (quoted by Sir Walter Scott, a distant relation) that McCulloch was in fact saved from execution by a gnome whom he had done a favour for earlier in life, and that he was never seen again. Another story tells that after his beheading, his headless body ran 100 yards down the Royal Mile. Given his sensational trial and the number of witnesses present, either story is unlikely at best.

After graduating, she joined Square (now Square Enix) as a composer in 1998. =Career= Her first score was the soundtrack to 1998's The Fallen Angels, by developer Steel Hearts, which she composed with Masaki Izutani. That same year, she joined Square and composed her first soundtrack for them to a game in the Chocobo series, Chocobo's Dungeon 2, with Yasuhiro Kawakami, Tsuyoshi Sekito and Kenji Ito. Her second work in the series was also her first solo soundtrack, that of Dice de Chocobo, a video game adaption of a board game. She composed for two other projects over the next two years, All Star Pro-Wrestling with Tsuyoshi Sekito and Kenichiro Fukui and Blue Wing Blitz by herself. Her first major composing role was in 2002, when she was one of three composers chosen to write the soundtrack to Final Fantasy XI. Although she did not contribute more than one song to the multiple expansions to the game, during this period she joined The Star Onions, a band made of Square Enix composers that arranges and performs Final Fantasy XI music. The group has released two albums to date. After Final Fantasy XI, Tanioka returned to the Chocobo series to arrange her Dice de Chocobo soundtrack for the game's remake, Chocobo Land: A Game of Dice. After that, however, she composed the soundtrack to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, which led to her composing the soundtracks to the other five games in the series. Between the games, she worked on the soundtracks to Code Age Commanders, Code Age Brawls, Project Sylpheed, and Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon. On February 28, 2010 Tanioka announced her departure from Square Enix, following several other Square Enix composers such as Kenichiro Fukui, Junya Nakano, and Masashi Hamauzu; she joined the composer's group GE-ON-DAN with many other composers like Nakano. In 2011, she became one of the founding members of Ringmasters, a non-exclusive worldwide group of artists and composers, though she later left the group. She composed in 2011 music for iOS interactive storybooks, Snow White, The Ugly Duckling, and Hansel and Gretel, before founding her own independent company, Riquismo, in August 2012. Riquismo is not a full studio, and Tanioka continues to work independently. Tanioka has said that she decided to become a freelance composer because she wanted to write for a wider variety of subjects. Since its founding she has composed music for Ragnarok Odyssey, for which she wrote independently of any prior music from the Ragnarok series, and MA.YU.MO.RI. Unlike the soundtracks to the numbered Final Fantasy games, no songs from the Crystal Chronicles or Chocobo soundtracks have appeared in any compilation albums produced by Square Enix. Songs from the two series have also not appeared in any of the official Final Fantasy music concerts, although \\"Morning Sky\\" from the Crystal Chronicles soundtrack was played in the first Games in Concert performance in Utrecht, Netherlands on November 26, 2006. It was performed by Floor Jansen of the band After Forever and the Metropole Orchestra. Musical style and influences Kumi Tanioka at a performance by The Star Onions Kumi Tanioka's signature style, especially for the Crystal Chronicles games, is that of \\"world music\\". She has described the musical style for the soundtrack to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles as being based on \\"ancient instruments\\". The soundtrack has extensive use of many medieval and renaissance musical instruments like the recorder, the crumhorn and the lute, creating a distinctively rustic feel, and also follows the practices and styles of medieval music. She says the idea came to her while looking at illustrations of the game world, which gave her the idea of making \\"world music\\", where the tracks would \\"not [be] limited to a single country or culture\\". She feels that specific instruments do not necessarily need to be tied to a specific geographic region, and tries to see, for example, how an Indian instrument and a Celtic instrument might work with each other. For the soundtrack to Ring of Fates, Tanioka tried to focus on \\"creating a new landscape containing the same atmosphere\\". She returned to using instruments in an \\"ethnic manner\\" again in composing the soundtrack for Echoes of Time. The piano performances in the Ring of Fates soundtrack were done by Kumi Tanioka. She did the performances herself rather than use an outside performer as most Final Fantasy soundtracks have done primarily because she \\"likes to play piano\\", and they were done without any sheet music, as she preferred instead to improvise. She took extensive piano lessons as a child, and lists piano and choral music as the biggest influences on her musical style. She also claims to have been influenced by music from a wide variety of cultures, like Indonesian, Irish and Balinese music. Tanioka has performed live at several events, including 2011's Final Fantasy XI-themed VanaCon; she likes to do live performances as she feels it connects her with the listener's response to her music, unlike when composing where she can only imagine audience's responses to hearing her music.

More than 450 Juris Doctor students attend CUA Law. Incoming classes are typically composed of about 150 students, including day and evening programs. Around 1,900 students apply annually. According to CUA Law's 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 49% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term, employment requiring bar passage nine months after graduation.  History  Catholic University of America began offering instruction in law in 1895 as part of its decision to open \\"faculties for the laity.\\" The department was turned into an official school in 1898. Catholic University's law school has established a progressive history of inclusion. Its first African-American student was enrolled in 1902; its first female student in 1922. In 1919, the Knights of Columbus founded an educational program known as Columbus University which provided an evening education program for Catholic war veterans returning from World War I. This institution was closely affiliated with Catholic University and shared faculty at both institutions' Washington, D.C. locations. In 1954 Columbus University (now consisting only of an evening law school) merged with Catholic University's law school to form the Columbus School of Law. The law school has been accredited by the Association of American Law Schools since 1921 and the American Bar Association since 1925. Academics = Curriculum = Columbus School of Law Catholic University's J.D. program can be completed over three years of full-time day study or four years of part-time evening study. The first-year curriculum is prescribed for all students. The day-division curriculum consists of seven required courses totaling 29 credit hours. Evening-division students are required to complete the same basic courses within the first two years of their law school career. Revised for 2013, the new curriculum is designed to strengthen first-year doctrinal courses, to support the development of practice-area concentrations, and to emphasize training that will help graduates transition to the real world of practice. The upper-division curriculum comprises several requirements, courses that are strongly recommended, and elective options. CUA Law students must complete a minimum of 84 credits to earn the J.D. degree. Required upper division courses include Constitutional Law II, Professional Responsibility, Professional Skills, and Upper-Level Writing. The law school is developing a Transition-to- Practice requirement for students. This new requirement is expected to be fulfilled by taking either a clinical course, or a capstone course. Foundational courses for all areas of legal practice—and thus strongly recommended for all Upper Division students— include Evidence, Corporations, and Criminal Procedure. To respond to increasing demand for specialized legal services, the Law School has developed practice-area concentrations for upper division students in Civil Litigation, Criminal Litigation, Family Law, Intellectual Property, Labor and Employment Law and Securities Regulation. =Degrees offered= In addition to the J.D. program, the school offers LL.M. programs in Law & Technology, Securities Law, and Comparative and International Law. The school also offers an LL.M. program in American law with the Faculty of Law and Administration of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. It allows Jagiellonian law students and students enrolled in the CUA-JU LL.M. program to study the essential substantive and procedural elements of the legal system of the United States. The school offers a M.L.S. degree program, which enhances the ability of professionals to work with lawyers and legal issues, to gain a deeper knowledge of a particular legal field, and to understand laws and regulations. Students can choose to concentrate in the fields of Compliance and Corporate Responsibility, Employment and Human Resources, or Intellectual Property. Alternatively, students may choose a General U.S. Law option, which provides a broad overview of the law and legal practice. =Faculty= CUA Law had 42 full-time faculty members as of 2013. The school's student-faculty ratio was 10.27 to 1. =Institutes and programs= CUA Law offers five opportunities for specialized legal study; four of them are certificate-granting. The programs are designed to give students the opportunity to pursue a specified concentration of courses. Each institute accepts approximately 15 students each academic year. They are: *Law and Technology Institute *Comparative and International Law Institute *Law and Public Policy Program *Securities and Corporate Law Program *Interdisciplinary Program in Law and Religion = Experiential learning = Founded in 1969, Columbus Community Legal Services offers four legal clinics that offer students hands-on learning. The Columbus Community Legal Services clinics include the General Practice Clinic; the Families and the Law Clinic; Advocacy for the Elderly, and the Consumer Protection Clinic. In addition, the school offers the Criminal Prosecution Clinic, the Immigration Litigation Clinic, the Innocence Project Clinic and Clemency Project, the Virginia Criminal Defense Clinic, and an SEC Student Observer Program. The Columbus School of Law has an extensive legal externship program through which about 200 upperclass students per year earn course credits during the fall, spring, and summer by working in nonprofit organizations; federal, state, and local government agencies; Congress; and for judges, law firms, trade associations and corporations in the D.C. area. =Publications= The Columbus School of Law has two student-edited law journals: *Catholic University Law Review *Catholic University Journal of Law and Technology Student life CUA Law enrolled a total of 519 students for the 2013-2014, 65.9% of whom were full-time students. The school's incoming class included 161 students. CUA Law had the third largest drop in enrollment between the 2010-2011 academic year and the 2013-2014 academic year with enrollment falling 39.5%. There are more than 30 active student organizations on campus. The school has a moot court program, with teams practicing in international law, communications law, labor law, constitutional law, securities law, national security, and a trials competition. The moot court team holds an annual inter-school competition between 1Ls called SoapBox.  Campus  Completed in 1994, the law building contains the Kathryn J. DuFour Law Library, the Walter A. Slowinski and Haislip and Yewell Courtrooms, and the three-story Keelty Atrium. It features a cafeteria, student lockers, an underground attached parking garage, and an ATM. The Columbus School of Law is located on the campus of the Catholic University of America and law students have access to many of the same services and facilities as undergraduate students. The school is a five-minute walk from the Brookland-CUA metro station. Admissions CUA Law had a 55.4% acceptance rate in 2013 with the school receiving 1,869 applications. The school's matriculation rate was 15.6%, with 161 of the 1,035 admits enrolling. The median LSAT and GPA was 154 and 3.21 for students entering in Fall 2013. Employment outcomes According to CUA Law's official 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 49% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term, employment requiring bar passage nine months after graduation. None of those jobs were school-funded positions. CUA Law ranked 150th out of the 201 ABA-approved law schools in terms of the percentage of 2013 graduates with non-school-funded, full-time, long-term, bar passage required jobs nine months after graduation. CUA Law's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 26.1%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non- professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. The majority of CUA Law 2013 graduates were employed in Washington, D.C., Maryland or Virginia nine months after graduation. Costs and student debt The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, living expenses and health insurance) at CUA Law for the 2013-2014 academic year is $70,212. The average annual increase in tuition and fees at CUA Law for the past five years has been 4.02%. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $269,220. According to U.S. News & World Report, the average indebtedness of 2013 graduates who incurred law school debt was $144,801 (not including undergraduate debt), and 86% of 2013 graduates took on debt.

It is one of several radiometric dating techniques exploiting the uranium radioactive decay series, in which 238U undergoes 14 alpha and beta decay events on the way to the stable isotope 206Pb. Other dating techniques using this decay series include uranium–thorium dating and uranium–lead dating. Uranium series 238U, with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, decays to 234U through emission of an alpha particle to thorium-234 (234Th), which is comparatively unstable with a half-life of just 24 days. 234Th then decays through beta particle emission to protactinium-234 (234Pa)). This decays with a half-life of 6.7 hours, again through emission of a beta particle, to 234U. This isotope has a half-life of about 245,000 years. The next decay product, thorium-230 (230Th), has a half-life of about 75,000 years and is used in the uranium-thorium technique. Although analytically simpler, in practice 234U/238U requires knowledge of the ratio at the time the material under study was formed and is generally used only for samples older than the ca. 450,000 year upper limit of the 230Th/238U technique. For those materials (principally marine carbonates) for which these conditions apply, it remains a superior technique. Unlike other radiometric dating techniques, those using the uranium decay series (except for those using the stable final isotopes 206Pb and 207Pb) compare the ratios of two radioactive unstable isotopes. This complicates calculations as both the parent and daughter isotopes decay over time into other isotopes. In theory, the 234U/238U technique can be useful in dating samples between about 10,000 and 2 million years Before Present (BP), or up to about eight times the half-life of 234U. As such, it provides a useful bridge in radiometric dating techniques between the ranges of 230Th/238U (accurate up to ca. 450,000 years) and U–Pb dating (accurate up to the age of the solar system, but problematic on samples younger than about 2 million years).

The current Spokane Indian Reservation is located in northeastern Washington, centered at Wellpinit (Sčecuwe).Spokane Tribe Language and Culture The reservation is located almost entirely in Stevens County, but also includes two small parcels of land (totaling about ) in Lincoln County, including part of the Spokane River. In total, the reservation is about . The city of Spokane, Washington (Sʎˈetkʷ) is named after the tribe. It developed along the Spokane River, within the historic ancestral land of the tribe, but not within the reservation (see map). The Spokane language (Npoqínišcn) belongs to the Interior Salishan language family, being a dialect of Montana Salish. Therefore they are close kin both by language and culture to the neighboring Bitterroot Salish (Flathead) (Tˈatˈʔayaqn) and Pend d'Oreilles. They were in loose alliance with other Plateau tribes - and sometimes the Kutenai (Sqlˈse), Crow Nation (Stemčiʔ) and Cree-Assiniboine (Iron Confederacy) (Ncoʕʷaqs) joined in - against their common enemy (Sˈmen), the mighty Blackfoot Confederacy (Sčqˈʷišni) and later Lakota people (Hułnʔixʷtˈusm) on the east. The precontact population of the Spokane people is estimated to be about 1,400 to 2,500 people. The populations of the tribe began to diminish after contact with settlers and traders due to mortality from new infectious diseases endemic among the Europeans, and to which the Spokane had no acquired immunity. By 1829 a Hudson Bay Company trader estimated there were about 700 Spokane people in the area. Since the early 20th century, their population has been steadily increasing: in 1985 tribal enrolled membership was reported as 1,961. In 2000 the US census reported the resident population of the reservation to be around 2,000 people.  Etymology  Different hypotheses are presented for the origin and meaning of the name: * The \\"Spokane\\" or \\"Spokan\\" are known as \\"People of the Sun\\" or sometimes as the \\"Muddy People\\" (perhaps referring to the wetlands along the rivers), likely because of a faulty translation of their name. According to Gibbs this was originally only the name of the Coeur d'Alene for one band of the Spokane, which was later transferred by the Europeans to all allied bands; according to other tradition it goes back to a chiefs name. * One of their native legends says that the term Spokane came from the noise like Spukcane a snake made when a person beat on a hollow tree where the snake was hiding. * Their self-designation, or autonym, was Spoqe'ind, meaning \\"round head\\" or Spoqín,Plateau People' Web Portal - Spoqín (Spokan) sometimes the autonym Sqeliz, meaning \\"people\\" is mentioned. Other sources give Sp'q'n'iʔ or Sp'q'n'i.  History  For thousands of years the Spokane people lived near the Spokane River in the territory of present-day eastern Washington and northern Idaho, surviving by hunting and gathering. Spokane territory once sprawled over three million acres (12,000 km²) of land. The Spokanes lived along the river in three bands known as the Upper, Middle and Lower Spokane Indians. The Spokane bands were semi nomadic, following game and plants on a seasonal basis for nine months of the year, and settling in permanent winter villages for the other three. The first Europeans whom the Spokane people had contact with were fur traders and explorers. The Lewis and Clark expedition encountered the Spokane tribe in 1805. Already the Spokane people were dwindling in population from introduced Eurasian diseases, such as smallpox, which were endemic among Europeans. Shortly after the encounter with the Lewis and Clark expedition, fur traders and settlers arrived. In 1810, the North West Company opened the Spokane House near the confluence of the Spokane and Little Spokane (Nxweme'a'tkxy - \\"river where the Steelhead trout run\\") rivers as a trade post. The Pacific Fur Company established Fort Spokane (Čˈłyaqˈ) in 1811. Much later, the structure was used as an Indian boarding school for the Spokane children, from 1898 to 1906. The Spokane took prominent part in the so called Coeur d'Alene War (Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-Pend d'oreille-Paloos War) of 1858, a series of encounters between the allied Native American tribes of the Skitswish (\\"Coeur d'Alene\\"), Kalispell (\\"Pend'Oreille\\"), Spokane, Palouse and Northern Paiute against United States Army forces in Washington and Idaho which centered in ancestral Spokane territories. By treaty between the federal government and the tribe, the people ceded most of their territory, accepting removal to the Spokane Reservation, which was established in 1881. In 1877, the Lower Spokane people (Scqesciłni) agreed to move to the Spokane Reservation. In 1887 the Upper (Sntʔtʔúlixʷ) and Middle Spokane people (Snxʷme̓nʔey) agreed to move to the Colville Reservation predominately inhabited by the Colville people (Sxʷyelpetkʷ). Not all the Spokane people moved from their traditional territory, which caused some conflict with white settlers. In the Coeur d'Alene War of 1858, the Spokane had allied with the Coeur d'Alene (Sčicwˈi), Yakima (Yiʔaqmeʔ), Palouse, and Paiute peoples against the European Americans. In the Nez Perce War of 1877, they remained neutral despite pleas from Nez Perce (Saʕaptni) chief Chief Joseph to join him in trying to expel the settlers. Prior to colonization by European-Americans, Chewelah was home to a band of the Kalispel people. The band was known as the slet̓éw̓si, meaning \\"valley people\\". The Chewelah Band of Indians is currently part of the Spokane Tribe. =Post-World War II to present= Around the 1950s, uranium was discovered on the reservation. With the development of nuclear weapons and other tools, it was considered highly valuable. It was mined (under leases arranged on behalf of the Spokane by the federal government) from 1956 to 1962 out of an open pit. This practice was ended, and from 1969 to 1982, uranium was mined at the Midnite Mine. The now inactive mine is on the list of Superfund cleanup sites, as the mining process left the grounds and underground water highly contaminated by metals, radionucleides and acidic drainage. The creation of dams on the Spokane and related waterways, to generate hydroelectric power and provide water for irrigation in the arid eastern part of the state, has also affected the Spokane people. Construction of the Little Falls dam resulted in the end of most of the salmon run at Spokane Falls. The Grand Coulee Dam, on the Columbia River, blocked salmon from migrating upriver and ended all salmon runs on the Spokane River. = Organization = The Spokane tribe was divided into three geographic divisions, upper, lower, and middle. Each area was divided into bands, which were composed of groups of related families or kin groups. The Upper Spokane or Sntʔtʔúlixʷ (Sntu't'ulixi) (\\"People of the Falls\\") resided along the Little Spokane River and all the country east of the Lower Spokane to within the borders of the Coeur d'Alene and Kalispel, sometimes their name is given as Sineka'lt (\\"[People] at the Rapids\\"). The Middle Spokane or Snxʷme̓nʔey (Snx'w'meney) (\\"People of the steelhead river, i.e. Little Spokane River\\") occupied the area near Spokane Falls to Hangman (Latah) Creek and Deep Creek to Tum Tum, Middle Spokane territory includes Spokane House, the site of the first permanent white settlement in Washington State, another variant of their name is Snxwemi'ne (\\"People of the steelhead trout place\\"). The Lower Spokane or Scqesciłni (Scqecioni) (\\"People of Little Falls\\") traditionally occupied the lower Spokane River from Little Falls to the confluence of the Columbia River, also known as Squasi'lni (\\"Fishers\\", after a settlement name). Individual bands were led by a Ilmixʷm or chief and a sub chief, who were both selected to lead based on their leadership qualities. Decisions were made by consensus of the group. The Spokane had a matrilocal custom, in which the husband of a Spokane woman, after marriage, would join her and her people as the site of their home together. Occasionally, the wife would move to the husband's people. There was mobility between bands, by which a person or family could spend one winter with a band and the next winter with another. =Lifestyle= The Spokane diet consisted of fish, local game, and plants, including nuts and roots. The men hunted whitetail deer and mule deer, which provided essential protein and other nutrients in the winter. Individual hunters would track the deer and kill them using a bow and arrow. Fish, especially salmon, were a huge part of the Spokane diet and also a large part of the trade economy. The Spokane people also ate trout and whitefish. They would smoke or dry the fish for trade or for storage in winter. Fish eyes were considered delicacies. Plants gathered by women provided nearly half of the caloric intake for the Spokane tribe. = Gender roles = Men of the Spokane tribe created tools, fished, and hunted. After the tribe acquired horses, the men cared for and trained these animals, and horses became a measure of wealth. The animals allowed the people to travel wider territories, and were used also to carry or pull their supplies. The men rode the horses during hunting and warfare. Horses were introduced to the Spokane tribe from either the Nez Perce, Kalispel, or Flathead tribe. By about 1800, the Spokane tribe was acquiring herds, showing that they had fully embraced use of these animals. Spokane women made coiled baskets out of birch bark (or from cedar roots). They wove wallets and bags from strips of processed animal hide. They would also sew mats and other items which were sometimes traded with other Native peoples and white traders and settlers. Some of the plants they gathered were camas roots and local berries and barks. The women used digging sticks to uproot and gather their food. It was a fundamental tool for their lives, and it was a rite of passage for young girls to be given their first digging sticks. Women's graves were often marked with these sticks. = Religion = A Spokane religion was the Dreamer Cult, also called Washani, meaning \\"worship\\" or \\"dancers\\". It developed in the Columbia Plateau tribes and emerged from the pressures of colonization during the second half of the nineteenth century. The Dreamer Cult developed as a mix of traditional spirituality and aspects of Christianity. The Dreamer prophets rejected non- Native culture and belief systems. The prophets advocated returning to traditional ways of life. \\"[P]rior to contact, Plateau Indian spirituality revolved around a complex of Winter dances, personal vision quests, and seasonal feasts tied to the annual subsistence cycle and the acquisition of guardian spirit powers\\"(Fisher). A few examples of spiritual dances include the Prophet Dance and the Spirit Dance, which took place in mid-January. Dancers sought to identify with the Prophet's spirit. In the Spirit Dance a shaman would call upon the spirit to visit an individual. It is believed the prophet Smohalla in a vision > \\"foresaw the disappearance of the whites, the resurrection of the Indian > dead, and the restoration of the world to a pristine state. This millennial > transformation required no acts of violence — indeed, most Dreamers > counseled pacifism — but to achieve it, the Indians had to obey the > instructions of the Creator as conveyed through the prophets\\" (Fisher). The Dreamer Cult remained prominent within the Columbia Plateau peoples until the early 1890s, when the major prophets died and their followers began to lose faith in the promise of a world free of white people. The closest contemporary religion to the Washani is the Seven Drums Religion.

The molecule is one of the three isomeric amines of pyridine. It is used as a research tool in characterizing subtypes of the potassium channel. It has also been used as a drug, to manage some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and is indicated for symptomatic improvement of walking in adults with several variations of the disease. It was undergoing Phase III clinical trials , and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the compound on January 22, 2010. Fampridine is also marketed as Ampyra (pronounced \\"am-PEER-ah,\\" according to the maker's website) in the United States by Acorda Therapeutics and as Fampyra in the European Union, Canada, and Australia. In Canada, the medication has been approved for use by Health Canada since February 10, 2012. Production 4-Aminopyridine is prepared by the decarbonylation of pyridine-4-carboxamide using sodium hypochlorite via the Hofmann rearrangement. The pyridine carboxamide is generated from the corresponding nitrile, which in turn is obtained from ammoxidation of 4-methylpyridine.Shinkichi Shimizu, Nanao Watanabe, Toshiaki Kataoka, Takayuki Shoji, Nobuyuki Abe, Sinji Morishita, Hisao Ichimura \\"Pyridine and Pyridine Derivatives\\" in \\"Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry\\" 2007; John Wiley & Sons: New York. Applications In the laboratory, 4-AP is a useful pharmacological tool in studying various potassium conductances in physiology and biophysics. It is a relatively selective blocker of members of Kv1 (Shaker, KCNA) family of voltage-activated K+ channels. However, 4-AP has been shown to potentiate voltage-gated Ca2+ channel currents independent of effects on voltage-activated K+ channels. Convulsant activity 4-Aminopyridine is a potent convulsant and is used to generate seizures in animal models for the evaluation of antiseizure agents. =Vertebrate pesticide= 4-Aminopyridine is also used under the trade name Avitrol as 0.5% or 1% in bird control bait. It causes convulsions and, infrequently, death, depending on dosage.EPA Reregistration Eligibility Decision for 4-aminopyridine, pg.23, September 27, 2007. The manufacturer says the proper dose should cause epileptic-like convulsions which cause the poisoned birds to emit distress calls resulting in the flock leaving the site; if the dose was sub-lethal, the birds will recover after 4 or more hours without long-term ill effect. The amount of bait should be limited so that relatively few birds are poisoned, causing the remainder of the flock to be frightened away with a minimum of mortality. A lethal dose will usually cause death within an hour. The use of 4-aminopyridine in bird control has been criticized by the Humane Society of the United States. Retrieved on December 23, 2008. =Medical use= Fampridine has been used clinically in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and multiple sclerosis. It acts by blocking voltage-gated potassium channels, prolonging action potentials and thereby increasing neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. The drug has been shown to reverse saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin toxicity in tissue and animal experiments.Octopus Envenomations at eMedicine.com In calcium entry blocker overdose in humans, 4-aminopyridine can increase the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration very efficiently independent of the calcium channels. Multiple sclerosis Fampridine has been shown to improve visual function and motor skills and relieve fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the effect of the drug is strongly established for walking capacity only. Common side effects include dizziness, nervousness and nausea, and the incidence of adverse effects was shown to be less than 5% in all studies. 4-AP works as a potassium channel blocker. Strong potassium currents decrease action potential duration and amplitude, which increases the probability of conduction failure − a well documented characteristic of demyelinated axons. Potassium channel blockade has the effect of increasing axonal action potential propagation and improving the probability of synaptic vesicle release. A study has shown that 4-AP is a potent calcium channel activator and can improve synaptic and neuromuscular function by directly acting on the calcium channel beta subunit. MS patients treated with 4-AP exhibited a response rate of 29.5% to 80%. A long-term study (32 months) indicated that 80-90% of patients who initially responded to 4-AP exhibited long-term benefits. Although improving symptoms, 4-AP does not inhibit progression of MS. Another study, conducted in Brazil, showed that treatment based on fampridine was considered efficient in 70% of the patients. Spinal cord injury Spinal cord injury patients have also seen improvement with 4-AP therapy. These improvements include sensory, motor and pulmonary function, with a decrease in spasticity and pain. Tetrodotoxin poisoning Clinical studies have shown that 4-AP is capable of reversing the effects of tetrodotoxin poisoning in animals, however, its effectiveness as an antidote in humans has not yet been determined. =Overdose= Case reports have shown that overdoses with 4-AP can lead to paresthesias, seizures, and atrial fibrillation. Contraindications 4-aminopyridine is excreted by the kidneys. 4-AP should not be given to people with significant kidney disease (e.g., acute kidney injury or advanced chronic kidney disease) due to the higher risk of seizures with increased circulating levels of 4-AP. Branding The drug was originally intended, by Acorda Therapeutics, to have the brand name Amaya, however the name was changed to Ampyra to avoid potential confusion with other marketed pharmaceuticals. Four of Acorda's patents pertaining to Ampyra were invalidated in 2017 by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and a fifth patent expired in 2018. Since then, generic alternatives have been developed for the U.S. market. The drug is marketed by Biogen Idec in Canada as Fampyra and as Dalstep in India by Sun Pharma.  Research  = Parkinson's disease = Dalfampridine completed Phase II clinical trials for Parkinson's disease in July 2014.

The movie was based on the 1941 play by Clifford Odets, adapted by writer Alfred Hayes. This was the first major film in which Monroe was credited before the movie's title, albeit with fourth billing.. During the shooting, the now famous nude calendar photos of Monroe surfaced and reporters swarmed around and hounded the actress, creating considerable distraction for the film makers.Bogdanovich, Peter: Fritz Lang in America,p. 81. Frederick A Praeger, 1969. Plot Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Ryan Mae Doyle returns to her home town, the fishing village of Monterey, California after 10 years \\"back East.\\" Joe, her fisherman brother, is not particularly pleased to see her, but accepts her back into the family home. His girlfriend Peggy is more welcoming. When Joe asks Mae about the rich man she was seeing, she explains he was a married politician. He died and left her some money, but his wife and relatives took her to court and won. Mae begins to date Jerry D'Amato, a good- natured, unsophisticated fisherman with his own boat. Mae instantly despises Jerry's friend, Earl Pfeiffer, a bitter, dissatisfied film projectionist. Mae's politician lover had made her feel more confident in herself; in stark contrast, Earl has a low opinion of women in general and makes no attempt to hide it. His wife is a vaudeville performer who is away frequently on tour. Earl, sensing a kindred restless spirit, is attracted to Mae right away. Jerry is oblivious to the tension between the two and soon asks Mae to marry him, despite her warning that she is not good for him. Mae decides to accept, even though she does not love or even respect her future husband, for the security and in the hope that she can change. A year after having a baby girl with Jerry, Mae becomes bored and restless. Earl, now divorced, makes a move on Mae. She resists at first, but then begins an affair with him. Jerry's uncle Vince, who bears a grudge against Mae, knows of the affair and tells his disbelieving nephew. When Jerry confronts the couple, Mae admits that she wants to leave Jerry to be with Earl. After a few drinks and having been prodded by Vince, Jerry finds and starts strangling Earl, until Mae arrives and breaks up the fight. Jerry leaves, horrified that he came close to killing his friend. When Mae goes home to take her baby away, she finds the crib empty. Earl tries to coax Mae to leave with him anyway, without the baby, but this does not sit well with Mae. After trading bitter recriminations, she breaks up with him. Later, however, Mae repents and convinces Jerry to take her back. Cast * Barbara Stanwyck as Mae Doyle D'Amato * Paul Douglas as Jerry D'Amato * Robert Ryan as Earl Pfeiffer * Marilyn Monroe as Peggy * Keith Andes as Joe Doyle * Silvio Minciotti as Papa D'Amato * J. Carrol Naish as Uncle Vince * Diane and Deborah Stewart as Gloria D'Amato Background Odets' Clash by Night originally was performed in 1941 as a neo-realist Broadway play with Tallulah Bankhead in the Stanwyck role. Fritz Lang changed the locale from Staten Island to a fishing town in California, but he kept intact the oppressive seacoast atmosphere. The drama is structured into two almost equal parts and each is almost a complete drama in its own. The two parts are separated by a year in time. Each section begins with a non-fiction, documentary look at the fishing industry in Monterey, California. It then moves on to the story. Arguably, the motion picture is two films: each of around an hour's length and strung together as a serial. The title of the film comes from Matthew Arnold's poem \\"Dover Beach\\" (1851). Specifically: It is a place \\"where ignorant armies clash by night.\\" Joan Crawford originally was announced as star. Reception =Critical response= When the film first opened the staff at Variety magazine was harsh on the film but appreciated Barbara Stanwyck's work, writing, \\"Clifford Odets' Clash by Night, presented on Broadway over a decade earlier, reaches the screen in a rather aimless drama of lust and passion. Clash captures much of the drabness of the seacoast fishing town, background of the pic, but only occasionally does the narrative's suggested intensity seep through...Barbara Stanwyck plays the returning itinerant with her customary defiance and sullenness. It is one of her better performances. Robert Ryan plays the other man with grim brutality while Marilyn Monroe is reduced to what is tantamount to a bit role.\\" Critic Sam Adams wrote about Fritz Lang directorial style, \\"Restraint was never Fritz Lang's problem. Indeed, his version of Clifford Odets' Clash by Night is overwrought verging on camp... In Clash's wild kingdom, strong women can only be sated by the threat of male violence: After she marries sturdy lug Paul Douglas, Stanwyck is unerringly drawn towards Ryan's volatile woman-hater, while fish-canner Marilyn Monroe shows her affection to fiance Keith Andes by socking him in the arm, a gesture he threatens to return in spades. Lang tilled the same turf two years later in Human Desire, a similarly heavy-handed expose of man's bestial nature. Perhaps Lang should have stuck with the style of Clash's extraordinary, near-wordless opening, which begins with shots of seagulls and seals and slowly mixes in the actors in their natural habitats.\\"Adams, Sam . Philadelphia City Paper, August 18–24, 2005. Last accessed: February 22, 2008. Critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \\"The performances are stagy but filled with fiery emotion. The performers are able to bring out the complexities underlying each of their characters as they battle each other, hoping not to die of loneliness or of cynicism. Everything about these characters and their alienation seemed natural, something that was grounded by Lang's showing them at work, never cutting them off from all the other travails they were going through. Lang's point is how easy it is not to see the faults in yourself, as easy as it is to see them in someone else. Clash by Night brilliantly tells how some lonely folks break out from their shadowy existence, as if that darkness was a prison where survival at any cost is the name of the game.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ibid. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 73% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 15 reviews, marking the film as \\"Fresh.\\"Clash by Night at Rotten Tomatoes.

The Bowery Ballroom holds something of a cult status among musicians as well as audiences. Rolling Stone magazine has awarded it #1 Best Club in America. \\"It's both intimate and grand, with consistently great sound and sightlines, and touches of old-school class, like 84-year-old bronze rails.\\" It has a capacity of 575 people. History The Bowery Ballroom was founded in 1998 by Michael Swier, Michael Winsch, and Brian Swier, who still own and operate the business. The club was the team's second music venue after The Mercury Lounge. The building at 6 Delancey Street was built to be a high-end shoe store and haberdashery just before the devastating Wall Street Crash of 1929. It stood vacant until the end of World War II, when it housed a series of shops. Over time the neighborhood declined.\\"History of the Bowery Ballroom\\", Bowery Ballroom website (archived 2007) In 1998 the building was fully renovated to become The Bowery Ballroom. Cofounder Michael Swier told the Village Voice and LA Weekly that he and his partners' goals have always been about quality of sound, as well as giving the best experience to both artists and the audience. Architect and cofounder Brian Swier designed the venue and directed renovations of the historic building with an eye to optimal acoustics for live music. Today the club is one of the rare remaining independent music venues, and continues to be regarded as one of the best for music purists. Both Gothamist and Thrillist tout it as one of New York City's best Music Venues. “From the beginning, opening the Mercury Lounge, it was all about the stage and the music — for the band, for the people coming to see the bands,” Michael Swier says. “Whether it's the sound system, the acoustic treatment, the way the band sounds to themselves onstage, the sightlines — it was all about that. That reputation of building really good clubs and treating both bands and patrons with the respect they deserve and putting the focus on that kind of grew out of those things.\\" Notable acts Patti Smith performed New Year's Eve at the Bowery Ballroom for fourteen consecutive years. The venue has hosted numerous acts including R.E.M., Coldplay, Kanye West, Lou Reed, Joan Jett, Radiohead, Tony Bennett, The Roots, Lana Del Rey, The Black Keys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The White Stripes, Metallica, Robert Plant, Arcade Fire, The Killers, Lady Gaga, The Dandy Warhols, The Strokes, Jeff Buckley, Broken Social Scene, and Yo La Tengo. Brooklyn-based alternative rock band They Might Be Giants has performed several concerts at the Bowery Ballroom.

The last day on Corinth, Tony Robert-Fleury, 1870 Greece in the Roman era describes the period of Greek history when Ancient Greece was dominated by the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 1453), commonly referred to as the Byzantine Empire after about AD 395. The Roman era of Greek history began with the Corinthian defeat in the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC. However, before the Achaean War, the Roman Republic had been steadily gaining control of mainland Greece by defeating the Kingdom of Macedon in a series of conflicts known as the Macedonian Wars. The Fourth Macedonian War ended at the Battle of Pydna in 148 BC and defeat of the Macedonian royal pretender Andriscus. The definitive Roman occupation of the Greek world was established after the Battle of Actium (31 BC), in which Augustus defeated Cleopatra VII, the Greek Ptolemaic queen of Egypt, and the Roman general Mark Antony, and afterwards conquered Alexandria (30 BC), the last great city of Hellenistic Greece.Hellenistic Age. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2013. Retrieved 27 May 2013. Archived here. The Roman era of Greek history continued with Emperor Constantine the Great's adoption of Byzantium as Nova Roma, the capital city of the Roman Empire; in AD 330, the city was renamed Constantinople. Afterwards, the Roman/Byzantine Empire was a generally Greek-speaking polity. Roman Republic The Roman conquest of Ancient Greece in the 2nd century BC. The Greek peninsula fell to the Roman Republic during the Battle of Corinth (146 BC), when Macedonia became a Roman province. Meanwhile, southern Greece also came under Roman hegemony, but some key Greek poleis remained partly autonomous and avoided direct Roman taxation. The Hellenistic Kingdom of Pergamon (282–133 BC) was annexed to that territory in 133 BC, when King Attalus III (r. 138–133 BC) willed the lands to Rome,Livy: Periochae 58, but the Romans were slow in securing their claim to those lands, and a pretender to the throne of Pergamon, Eumenes III (Aristonicus) led a revolt with the help of the philosopher Blossius, which the Roman army suppressed in 129 BC, when the lands of Pergamon were divided among Rome, the Kingdom of Pontus, and Cappadocia. In 88 BC, Athens and other Greek city- states revolted against Rome and were suppressed by General Lucius Cornelius Sulla. During the Roman civil wars, Greece was physically and economically devastated until Augustus organised the peninsula as the province of Achaea, in 27 BC. Initially, Rome's conquest of Greece damaged the economy, but it readily recovered under Roman administration in the postwar period. Moreover, the Greek cities in Asia Minor recovered from the Roman conquest more rapidly than the cities of peninsular Greece, which had been much damaged in the war with Sulla. As an empire, Rome invested resources and rebuilt the cities of Roman Greece, and established Corinth as the capital city of the province of Achaea, and Athens prospered as a cultural hub of philosophy, education and learned knowledge. Early Roman Empire Life in Greece continued under the Roman Empire much the same as it had previously. Roman culture was highly influenced by the Greeks; as Horace said, Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit (\\"Captive Greece captured her rude conqueror\\"). The epics of Homer inspired the Aeneid of Virgil, and authors such as Seneca the Younger wrote using Greek styles. Some Roman nobles regarded the Greeks as backwards and petty, but many others embraced Greek literature and philosophy. The Greek language became a favorite of the educated and elite in Rome, such as Scipio Africanus, who tended to study philosophy and regarded Greek culture and science as an example to be followed. The Roman Emperor Nero visited Greece in AD 66, and performed at the Ancient Olympic Games, despite the rules against non-Greek participation. He was honoured with a victory in every contest, and in the following year, he proclaimed the freedom of the Greeks at the Isthmian Games in Corinth, just as Flamininus had over 200 years previously. Hadrian was also particularly fond of the Greeks; before he became emperor he had served as an eponymous archon of Athens. He also finished the Temple of Zeus there and the Athenians built the Arch of Hadrian in his honour nearby. Many temples and public buildings were built in Greece by emperors and wealthy Roman nobility, especially in Athens. Julius Caesar began construction of the Roman agora in Athens, which was finished by Augustus. The main gate, the Gate of Athena Archegetis, was dedicated to the patron goddess of Athens, Athena. The Agrippeia was built in the centre of the Ancient Agora of Athens by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Emperor Hadrian was a philhellene and an ardent admirer of Greece and, seeing himself as an heir to Pericles, made many contributions to Athens. He built the Library of Hadrian in the city and completed the construction of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, some 638 years after its construction had been started by Athenian tyrants but ended because of the belief that building on such a scale would cause hubris. The Athenians built the Arch of Hadrian to honor Emperor Hadrian. The side of the arch facing the Athenian agora and the Acropolis had an inscription stating, \\"This is Athens, the ancient city of Theseus.\\" The side facing the Temple of Zeus and the 'new city' (this was still part of the ancient city; e.g. the Panathenaic Stadium has always been on that side) had an inscription stating, \\"This is the city of Hadrian, and not of Theseus\\". Adrianou (Hadrian Street) exists to this day, leading from the arch to the Ancient Agora. The Pax Romana was the longest period of peace in Greek history, and Greece became a major crossroads of maritime trade between Rome and the Greek speaking eastern half of the empire. The Greek language served as a lingua franca in the East and in Italy, and many Greek intellectuals such as Galen would perform most of their work in Rome. During this time, Greece and much of the rest of the Roman east came under the influence of Early Christianity. The apostle Paul of Tarsus preached in Philippi, Corinth and Athens, and Greece soon became one of the most highly Christianized areas of the empire. Later Roman Empire During the 2nd and 3rd centuries, Greece was divided into provinces including Achaea, Macedonia, Epirus and Thrace. During the reign of Diocletian in the late 3rd century, Moesia was organized as a diocese, and was ruled by Galerius. Under Constantine (who professed Christianity) Greece was part of the prefectures of Macedonia and Thrace. Theodosius divided the prefecture of Macedonia into the provinces of Creta, Achaea, Thessalia, Epirus Vetus, Epirus Nova, and Macedonia. The Aegean islands formed the province of Insulae in the Diocese of Asia. Greece faced invasions from the Heruli, Goths, and Vandals during the reign of Romulus Augustulus. Stilicho, who pretended he was a regent for Arcadius, evacuated Thessaly when the Visigoths invaded in the late 4th century. Arcadius' chief advisor Eutropius allowed Alaric to enter Greece, and he looted Athens, Corinth and the Peloponnese. Stilicho eventually drove him out around 397 and Alaric was made magister militum in Illyricum. Eventually, Alaric and the Goths migrated to Italy, sacked Rome in 410, and built the Visigothic Kingdom in Iberia, which lasted until 711 with the advent of the Arabs. Greece remained part of the relatively cohesive and robust eastern half of the empire, which eventually became the center of the remaining Roman Empire, the Eastern Roman now referred to as Byzantine Empire. Contrary to outdated visions of Late Antiquity, the Greek peninsula was most likely one of the most prosperous regions of the Roman Empire. Older scenarios of poverty, depopulation, barbarian destruction, and civil decay have been revised in light of recent archaeological discoveries.Rothaus, p. 10. \\"The question of the continuity of civic institutions and the nature of the polis in the late antique and early Byzantine world have become a vexed question, for a variety of reasons. Students of this subject continue to contend with scholars of earlier periods who adhere to a much-outdated vision of late antiquity as a decadent decline into impoverished fragmentation. The cities of late-antique Greece displayed a marked degree of continuity. Scenarios of barbarian destruction, civic decay, and manorialization simply do not fit. In fact, the city as an institution appears to have prospered in Greece during this period. It was not until the end of the 6th century (and maybe not even then) that the dissolution of the city became a problem in Greece. If the early 6th century Syndekmos of Hierokles is taken at face value, late-antique Greece was highly urbanized and contained approximately eighty cities. This extreme prosperity is born out by recent archaeological surveys in the Aegean. For late-antique Greece, a paradigm of prosperity and transformation is more accurate and useful than a paradigm of decline and fall.\\" In fact the polis, as an institution, appears to have remained prosperous until at least the 6th century. Contemporary texts such as Hierokles' Syndekmos affirm that late antiquity Greece was highly urbanised and contained approximately eighty cities. This view of extreme prosperity is widely accepted today, and it is assumed between the 4th and 7th centuries AD, Greece may have been one of the most economically active regions in the eastern Mediterranean.

In some older texts, the resultant is also called the eliminant. The resultant is widely used in number theory, either directly or through the discriminant, which is essentially the resultant of a polynomial and its derivative. The resultant of two polynomials with rational or polynomial coefficients may be computed efficiently on a computer. It is a basic tool of computer algebra, and is a built-in function of most computer algebra systems. It is used, among others, for cylindrical algebraic decomposition, integration of rational functions and drawing of curves defined by a bivariate polynomial equation. The resultant of n homogeneous polynomials in n variables (also called multivariate resultant, or Macaulay's resultant for distinguishing it from the usual resultant) is a generalization, introduced by Macaulay, of the usual resultant. It is, with Gröbner bases, one of the main tools of effective elimination theory (elimination theory on computers). Notation The resultant of two univariate polynomials and is commonly denoted \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B) or \\\\operatorname{Res}(A,B). In many applications of the resultant, the polynomials depend on several indeterminates and may be considered as univariate polynomials in one of their indeterminates, with polynomials in the other indeterminates as coefficients. In this case, the indeterminate that is selected for defining and computing the resultant is indicated as a subscript: \\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B) or \\\\operatorname{Res}_x(A,B). The degrees of the polynomials are used in the definition of the resultant. However, a polynomial of degree may also be considered as a polynomial of higher degree where the leading coefficients are zero. If such a higher degree is used for the resultant, it is usually indicated as a subscript or a superscript, such as \\\\operatorname{res}_{d,e}(A,B) or \\\\operatorname{res}_x^{d,e}(A,B). Definition The resultant of two univariate polynomials over a field or over a commutative ring is commonly defined as the determinant of their Sylvester matrix. More precisely, let :A=a_0x^d +a_1x^{d-1} + \\\\cdots + a_d and :B=b_0x^e +b_1x^{e-1} + \\\\cdots + b_e be nonzero polynomials of degrees and respectively. Let us denote by \\\\mathcal{P}_i the vector space (or free module if the coefficients belong to a commutative ring) of dimension whose elements are the polynomials of degree strictly less than . The map :\\\\varphi:\\\\mathcal{P}_{e}\\\\times \\\\mathcal{P}_{d} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{P}_{d+e} such that :\\\\varphi(P,Q)=AP+BQ is a linear map between two spaces of the same dimension. Over the basis of the powers of (listed in descending order), this map is represented by a square matrix of dimension , which is called the Sylvester matrix of and (for many authors and in the article Sylvester matrix, the Sylvester matrix is defined as the transpose of this matrix; this convention is not used here, as it breaks the usual convention for writing the matrix of a linear map). The resultant of and is thus the determinant :\\\\begin{vmatrix} a_0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & b_0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_1 & a_0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & b_1 & b_0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_2 & a_1 & \\\\ddots & 0 & b_2 & b_1 & \\\\ddots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots &\\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & a_0 & \\\\vdots &\\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & b_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_d & a_{d-1} & \\\\cdots & \\\\vdots & b_e & b_{e-1} & \\\\cdots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & a_d & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & 0 & b_e & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & a_{d-1} & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & b_{e-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & a_d & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & b_e \\\\end{vmatrix}, which has columns of and columns of (the fact that the first column of 's and the first column of 's have the same length, that is , is here only for simplifying the display of the determinant). For instance, taking and we get :\\\\begin{vmatrix} a_0 & 0 & b_0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_1 & a_0 & b_1 & b_0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_2 & a_1 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_3 & a_2 & 0 & b_2 & b_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & a_3 & 0 & 0 & b_2 \\\\end{vmatrix}. If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to an integral domain, then :\\\\operatorname{res}(A, B) = a_0^e b_0^d \\\\prod_{\\\\begin{array}{c}1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq d\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq e\\\\end{array}} (\\\\lambda_i-\\\\mu_j) = a_0^e \\\\prod_{i=1}^d B(\\\\lambda_i) = (-1)^{de} b_0^d \\\\prod_{j=1}^e A(\\\\mu_j), where \\\\lambda_1, \\\\dots, \\\\lambda_d and \\\\mu_1,\\\\dots,\\\\mu_e are respectively the roots, counted with their multiplicities, of and in any algebraically closed field containing the integral domain. This is a straightforward consequence of the characterizing properties of the resultant that appear below. In the common case of integer coefficients, the algebraically closed field is generally chosen as the field of complex numbers. Properties In this section and its subsections, and are two polynomials in of respective degrees and , and their resultant is denoted \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B). =Characterizing properties= The resultant of two polynomials and of respective degrees and , with coefficients in a commutative ring , has the following properties that characterize the resultant, if is a field or, more generally, an integral domain * If is a subring of another ring , then \\\\operatorname{res}_R(A,B) = \\\\operatorname{res}_S(A,B). That is and have the same resultant when considered as polynomials over or . *If (that is if A=a_0 is a nonzero constant) then \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B) = a_0^e. Similarly, if , then \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B) = b_0^d. * \\\\operatorname{res}(x+a_1, x+b_1) = b_1-a_1 * \\\\operatorname{res}(B,A)=(-1)^{de} \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B) * \\\\operatorname{res}(AB,C) = \\\\operatorname{res}(A,C)\\\\operatorname{res}(B,C) In other words, the resultant is the unique function of the coefficients of two polynomials that has these properties. =Zeros= * The resultant of two polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain is zero if and only if they have a common divisor of positive degree. * The resultant of two polynomials with coefficients in an integral domain is zero if and only if they have a common root in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients. * There exists a polynomial of degree less than and a polynomial of degree less than such that \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B)=AP+BQ. This is a generalization of Bézout's identity to polynomials over an arbitrary commutative ring. In other words, the resultant of two polynomials belongs to the ideal generated by these polynomials. =Invariance by ring homomorphisms= Let and be two polynomials of respective degrees and with coefficients in a commutative ring , and \\\\varphi\\\\colon R\\\\to S a ring homomorphism of into another commutative ring . Applying \\\\varphi to the coefficients of a polynomial extends \\\\varphi to a homomorphism of polynomial rings R[x]\\\\to S[x], which is also denoted \\\\varphi. With this notation, we have: * If \\\\varphi preserves the degrees of and (that is if \\\\deg(\\\\varphi(A)) = d and \\\\deg(\\\\varphi(B))= e), then ::\\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B))=\\\\operatorname{res}(\\\\varphi(A), \\\\varphi(B)). * If \\\\deg(\\\\varphi(A)) < d and \\\\deg(\\\\varphi(B))< e, then ::\\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B)) = 0. * If \\\\deg(\\\\varphi(A)) = d and \\\\deg(\\\\varphi(B)) =f < e, and the leading coefficient of is a_0 then ::\\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B))=\\\\varphi(a_0)^{e-f}\\\\operatorname{res}(\\\\varphi(A), \\\\varphi(B)). * If \\\\deg(\\\\varphi(A)) = f and \\\\deg(\\\\varphi(B)) = e, and the leading coefficient of is b_0 then ::\\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B)) = (-1)^{e(d-f)}\\\\varphi(b_0)^{d-f}\\\\operatorname{res}(\\\\varphi(A), \\\\varphi(B)). These properties are easily deduced from the definition of the resultant as a determinant. They are mainly used in two situations. For computing a resultant of polynomials with integer coefficients, it is generally faster to compute it modulo several primes and to retrieve the desired resultant with Chinese remainder theorem. When is a polynomial ring in other indeterminates, and is the ring obtained by specializing to numerical values some or all indeterminates of , these properties may be restated as if the degrees are preserved by the specialization, the resultant of the specialization of two polynomials is the specialization of the resultant. This property is fundamental, for example, for cylindrical algebraic decomposition. =Invariance under change of variable= *\\\\operatorname{res}(A(x+a), B(x+a)) = \\\\operatorname{res}(A(x), B(x)) *\\\\operatorname{res}(A(ax), B(ax)) = a^{de}\\\\operatorname{res}(A(x), B(x)) * If A_r(x)=x^dA(1/x) and B_r(x)=x^eB(1/x) are the reciprocal polynomials of and , respectively, then ::\\\\operatorname{res}(A_r, B_r)= (-1)^{de}\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B) This means that the property of the resultant being zero is invariant under linear and projective changes of the variable. =Invariance under change of polynomials= *If and are nonzero constants (that is they are independent of the indeterminate ), and and are as above, then ::\\\\operatorname{res}(aA,bB) =a^eb^d\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B). *If and are as above, and is another polynomial such that the degree of is , then ::\\\\operatorname{res}(A-CB, B)=b_0^{\\\\delta-d}\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B). *In particular, if either is monic, or , then ::\\\\operatorname{res}(A-CB,B) = \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B), :and, if , then ::\\\\operatorname{res}(A-CB, B)=b_0^{e+f-d}\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B). These properties imply that in the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials, and all its variants (pseudo-remainder sequences), the resultant of two successive remainders (or pseudo-remainders) differs from the resultant of the initial polynomials by a factor which is easy to compute. Conversely, this allows one to deduce the resultant of the initial polynomials from the value of the last remainder or pseudo-remainder. This is the starting idea of the subresultant- pseudo-remainder-sequence algorithm, which uses the above formulae for getting subresultant polynomials as pseudo-remainders, and the resultant as the last nonzero pseudo-remainder (provided that the resultant is not zero). This algorithm works for polynomials over the integers or, more generally, over an integral domain, without any division other than exact divisions (that is, without involving fractions). It involves O(de) arithmetic operations, while the computation of the determinant of the Sylvester matrix with standard algorithms requires O((d+e)^3) arithmetic operations. =Generic properties= In this section, we consider two polynomials :A=a_0x^d +a_1x^{d-1} + \\\\cdots + a_d and :B=b_0x^e +b_1x^{e-1} + \\\\cdots + b_e whose coefficients are distinct indeterminates. Let :R=\\\\mathbb{Z}[a_0, \\\\ldots, a_d, b_0, \\\\ldots, b_e] be the polynomial ring over the integers defined by these indeterminates. The resultant \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B) is often called the generic resultant for the degrees and . It has the following properties. *\\\\operatorname{res}(A,B) is an absolutely irreducible polynomial. *If I is the ideal of R[x] generated by and , then I\\\\cap R is the principal ideal generated by \\\\operatorname{res}(A,B). =Homogeneity= The generic resultant for the degrees and is homogeneous in various ways. More precisely: * It is homogeneous of degree in a_0, \\\\ldots, a_d. * It is homogeneous of degree in b_0, \\\\ldots, b_e. * It is homogeneous of degree in all the variables a_i and b_j. * If a_i and b_i are given the weight (that is, the weight of each coefficient is its degree as elementary symmetric polynomial), then it is quasi-homogeneous of total weight . *If and are homogeneous multivariate polynomials of respective degrees and , then their resultant in degrees and with respect to an indeterminate , denoted \\\\operatorname{res}_x^{d,e}(P,Q) in , is homogeneous of degree in the other indeterminates. =Elimination property= ∗Let I=\\\\langle A, B\\\\rangle be the ideal generated by two polynomials and in a polynomial ring R[x], where R=k[y_1,\\\\ldots,y_n] is itself a polynomial ring over a field. If at least one of and is monic in , then: * \\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B)\\\\in I \\\\cap R * The ideals I\\\\cap R and R\\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B) define the same algebraic set. That is, a tuple of elements of an algebraically closed field is a common zero of the elements of I\\\\cap R if and only it is a zero of \\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B). * The ideal I\\\\cap R has the same radical as the principal ideal R\\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B). That is, each element of I\\\\cap R has a power that is a multiple of \\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B). * All irreducible factors of \\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B) divide every element of I\\\\cap R. The first assertion is a basic property of the resultant. The other assertions are immediate corollaries of the second one, which can be proved as follows. As at least one of and is monic, a tuple (\\\\beta_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\beta_n) is a zero of \\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B) if and only if there exists \\\\alpha such that (\\\\beta_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\beta_n, \\\\alpha) is a common zero of and . Such a common zero is also a zero of all elements of I\\\\cap R. Conversely, if (\\\\beta_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\beta_n, \\\\alpha) is a common zero of the elements of I\\\\cap R, it is a zero of the resultant, and there exists \\\\alpha such that (\\\\beta_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\beta_n, \\\\alpha) is a common zero of and . So I\\\\cap R and R\\\\operatorname{res}_x(A,B) have exactly the same zeros. Computation Theoretically, the resultant could be computed by using the formula expressing it as a product of roots differences. However, as the roots may generally not be computed exactly, such an algorithm would be inefficient and numerically unstable. As the resultant is a symmetric function of the roots of each polynomial, it could also be computed by using the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, but this would be highly inefficient. As the resultant is the determinant of the Sylvester matrix (and of the Bézout matrix), it may be computed by using any algorithm for computing determinants. This needs O(n^3) arithmetic operations. As algorithms are known with a better complexity (see below), this method is not used in practice. It follows from that the computation of a resultant is strongly related to the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. This shows that the computation of the resultant of two polynomials of degrees and may be done in O(de) arithmetic operations in the field of coefficients. However, when the coefficients are integers, rational numbers or polynomials, these arithmetic operations imply a number of GCD computations of coefficients which is of the same order and make the algorithm inefficient. The subresultant pseudo- remainder sequences were introduced to solve this problem and avoid any fraction and any GCD computation of coefficients. A more efficient algorithm is obtained by using the good behavior of the resultant under a ring homomorphism on the coefficients: to compute a resultant of two polynomials with integer coefficients, one computes their resultants modulo sufficiently many prime numbers and then reconstructs the result with the Chinese remainder theorem. The use of fast multiplication of integers and polynomials allows algorithms for resultants and greatest common divisors that have a better time complexity, which is of the order of the complexity of the multiplication, multiplied by the logarithm of the size of the input (\\\\log(s(d+e)), where is an upper bound of the number of digits of the input polynomials). Application to polynomial systems Resultants were introduced for solving systems of polynomial equations and provide the oldest proof that there exist algorithms for solving such systems. These are primarily intended for systems of two equations in two unknowns, but also allow solving general systems. =Case of two equations in two unknowns= Consider the system of two polynomial equations :\\\\begin{align} P(x,y)&=0\\\\\\\\\\\\ Q(x,y)&=0, \\\\end{align} where and are polynomials of respective total degrees and . Then R=\\\\operatorname{res}_y^{d,e}(P,Q) is a polynomial in , which is generically of degree (by properties of ). A value \\\\alpha of is a root of if and only if either there exist \\\\beta in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients, such that P(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)=Q(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)=0, or \\\\deg(P(\\\\alpha,y)) and \\\\deg(Q(\\\\alpha,y)) (in this case, one says that and have a common root at infinity for x=\\\\alpha). Therefore, solutions to the system are obtained by computing the roots of , and for each root \\\\alpha, computing the common root(s) of P(\\\\alpha,y), Q(\\\\alpha,y), and \\\\operatorname{res}_x(P,Q). Bézout's theorem results from the value of \\\\deg\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{res}_y(P,Q)\\\\right)\\\\le de, the product of the degrees of and . In fact, after a linear change of variables, one may suppose that, for each root of the resultant, there is exactly one value of such that is a common zero of and . This shows that the number of common zeros is at most the degree of the resultant, that is at most the product of the degrees of and . With some technicalities, this proof may be extended to show that, counting multiplicities and zeros at infinity, the number of zeros is exactly the product of the degrees. =General case= At first glance, it seems that resultants may be applied to a general polynomial system of equations :P_1(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)=0 :\\\\vdots :P_k(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)=0 by computing the resultants of every pair (P_i,P_j) with respect to x_n for eliminating one unknown, and repeating the process until getting univariate polynomials. Unfortunately, this introduces many spurious solutions, which are difficult to remove. A method, introduced at the end of the 19th century, works as follows: introduce new indeterminates U_2, \\\\ldots, U_k and compute :\\\\operatorname{res}_{x_n}(P_1, U_2P_2 +\\\\cdots +U_kP_k). This is a polynomial in U_2, \\\\ldots, U_k whose coefficients are polynomials in x_1, \\\\ldots, x_{n-1}, which have the property that \\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_{n-1} is a common zero of these polynomial coefficients, if and only if the univariate polynomials P_i(\\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_{n-1}, x_n) have a common zero, possibly at infinity. This process may be iterated until finding univariate polynomials. To get a correct algorithm two complements have to be added to the method. Firstly, at each step, a linear change of variable may be needed in order that the degrees of the polynomials in the last variable are the same as their total degree. Secondly, if, at any step, the resultant is zero, this means that the polynomials have a common factor and that the solutions split in two components: one where the common factor is zero, and the other which is obtained by factoring out this common factor before continuing. This algorithm is very complicated and has a huge time complexity. Therefore, its interest is mainly historical. Other applications =Number theory= The discriminant of a polynomial, which is a fundamental tool in number theory is the quotient by its leading coefficient of the resultant of the polynomial and its derivative. If \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are algebraic numbers such that P(\\\\alpha)=Q(\\\\beta)=0, then \\\\gamma=\\\\alpha+\\\\beta is a root of the resultant \\\\operatorname{res}_x(P(x),Q(z-x)), and \\\\tau = \\\\alpha\\\\beta is a root of \\\\operatorname{res}_x(P(x),x^nQ(z/x)), where n is the degree of Q(y). Combined with the fact that 1/\\\\beta is a root of y^nQ(1/y) = 0, this shows that the set of algebraic numbers is a field. Let K(\\\\alpha) be an algebraic field extension generated by an element \\\\alpha, which has P(x) as minimal polynomial. Every element of \\\\beta \\\\in K(\\\\alpha) may be written as \\\\beta=Q(\\\\alpha), where Q is a polynomial. Then \\\\beta is a root of \\\\operatorname{res}_x(P(x),z-Q(x)), and this resultant is a power of the minimal polynomial of \\\\beta. =Algebraic geometry= Given two plane algebraic curves defined as the zeros of the polynomials and , the resultant allows the computation of their intersection. More precisely, the roots of \\\\operatorname{res}_y(P,Q) are the x-coordinates of the intersection points and of the common vertical asymptotes, and the roots of \\\\operatorname{res}_x(P,Q) are the y-coordinates of the intersection points and of the common horizontal asymptotes. A rational plane curve may be defined by a parametric equation : x=\\\\frac{P(t)}{R(t)},\\\\qquad y=\\\\frac{Q(t)}{R(t)}, where , and are polynomials. An implicit equation of the curve is given by :\\\\operatorname{res}_t(xR-P,yR-Q). The degree of this curve is the highest degree of , and , which is equal to the total degree of the resultant. =Symbolic integration= In symbolic integration, for computing the antiderivative of a rational fraction, one uses partial fraction decomposition for decomposing the integral into a \\"rational part\\", which is a sum of rational fractions whose antiprimitives are rational fractions, and a \\"logarithmic part\\" which is a sum of rational fractions of the form :\\\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}, where is a square-free polynomial and is a polynomial of lower degree than . The antiderivative of such a function involves necessarily logarithms, and generally algebraic numbers (the roots of ). In fact, the antiderivative is :\\\\int \\\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}dx=\\\\sum_{Q(\\\\alpha)=0} \\\\frac{P(\\\\alpha)}{Q'(\\\\alpha)}\\\\log(x-\\\\alpha), where the sum runs over all complex roots of . The number of algebraic numbers involved by this expression is generally equal to the degree of , but it occurs frequently that an expression with less algebraic numbers may be computed. The Lazard–Rioboo–Trager method produced an expression, where the number of algebraic numbers is minimal, without any computation with algebraic numbers. Let : S_1(r) S_2(r)^2 \\\\cdots S_k(r)^k = \\\\operatorname{res}_r (rQ'(x)-P(x), Q(x)) be the square-free factorization of the resultant which appears on the right. Trager proved that the antiderivative is :\\\\int \\\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}dx=\\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\sum_{S_i(\\\\alpha)=0} \\\\alpha \\\\log(T_i(\\\\alpha,x)), where the internal sums run over the roots of the S_i (if S_i=1 the sum is zero, as being the empty sum), and T_i(r,x) is a polynomial of degree in . The Lazard-Rioboo contribution is the proof that T_i(r,x) is the subresultant of degree of rQ'(x)-P(x) and Q(x). It is thus obtained for free if the resultant is computed by the subresultant pseudo-remainder sequence. =Computer algebra= All preceding applications, and many others, show that the resultant is a fundamental tool in computer algebra. In fact most computer algebra systems include an efficient implementation of the computation of resultants. Homogeneous resultant The resultant is also defined for two homogeneous polynomial in two indeterminates. Given two homogeneous polynomials and of respective total degrees and , their homogeneous resultant is the determinant of the matrix over the monomial basis of the linear map :(A,B) \\\\mapsto AP+BQ, where runs over the bivariate homogeneous polynomials of degree , and runs over the homogeneous polynomials of degree . In other words, the homogeneous resultant of and is the resultant of and when they are considered as polynomials of degree and (their degree in may be lower than their total degree): :\\\\operatorname{Res}(P(x,y),Q(x,y)) = \\\\operatorname{res}_{p,q}(P(x,1),Q(x,1)). (The capitalization of \\"Res\\" is used here for distinguishing the two resultants, although there is no standard rule for the capitalization of the abbreviation). The homogeneous resultant has essentially the same properties as the usual resultant, with essentially two differences: instead of polynomial roots, one considers zeros in the projective line, and the degree of a polynomial may not change under a ring homomorphism. That is: * The resultant of two homogeneous polynomials over an integral domain is zero if and only if they have a non-zero common zero over an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients. * If and are two bivariate homogeneous polynomials with coefficients in a commutative ring , and \\\\varphi\\\\colon R\\\\to S a ring homomorphism of into another commutative ring , then extending \\\\varphi to polynomials over , ones has ::\\\\operatorname{Res}(\\\\varphi(P), \\\\varphi(Q)) = \\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{Res}(P,Q)). * The property of an homogeneous resultant to be zero is invariant under any projective change of variables. Any property of the usual resultant may similarly extended to the homogeneous resultant, and the resulting property is either very similar or simpler than the corresponding property of the usual resultant. Macaulay's resultant Macaulay's resultant, named after Francis Sowerby Macaulay, also called the multivariate resultant, or the multipolynomial resultant,, Chapter 3. Resultants is a generalization of the homogeneous resultant to homogeneous polynomials in indeterminates. Macaulay's resultant is a polynomial in the coefficients of these homogeneous polynomials that vanishes if and only if the polynomials have a common non-zero solution in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients, or, equivalently, if the hyper surfaces defined by the polynomials have a common zero in the dimensional projective space. The multivariate resultant is, with Gröbner bases, one of the main tools of effective elimination theory (elimination theory on computers). Like the homogeneous resultant, Macaulay's may be defined with determinants, and thus behaves well under ring homomorphisms. However, it cannot be defined by a single determinant. It follows that it is easier to define it first on generic polynomials. =Resultant of generic homogeneous polynomials= A homogeneous polynomial of degree in variables may have up to :\\\\binom{n+d-1}{n-1}=\\\\frac{(n+d-1)!}{(n-1)!\\\\,d!} coefficients; it is said to be generic, if these coefficients are distinct indeterminates. Let P_1, \\\\ldots, P_n be generic homogeneous polynomials in indeterminates, of respective degrees d_1, \\\\dots, d_n. Together, they involve :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\binom{n+d_i-1}{n-1} indeterminate coefficients. Let be the polynomial ring over the integers, in all these indeterminate coefficients. The polynomials P_1, \\\\ldots, P_n belong thus to C[x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n], and their resultant (still to be defined) belongs to . The Macaulay degree is the integer D=d_1+\\\\cdots+d_n-n+1, which is fundamental in Macaulay's theory. For defining the resultant, one considers the Macaulay matrix, which is the matrix over the monomial basis of the -linear map :(Q_1, \\\\ldots, Q_n)\\\\mapsto Q_1P_1+\\\\cdots+Q_nP_n, in which each Q_i runs over the homogeneous polynomials of degree D-d_i, and the codomain is the -module of the homogeneous polynomials of degree . If , the Macaulay matrix is the Sylvester matrix, and is a square matrix, but this is no longer true for . Thus, instead of considering the determinant, one considers all the maximal minors, that is the determinants of the square submatrices that have as many rows as the Macaulay matrix. Macaulay proved that the -ideal generated by these principal minors is a principal ideal, which is generated by the greatest common divisor of these minors. As one is working with polynomials with integer coefficients, this greatest common divisor is defined up its sign. The generic Macaulay resultant is the greatest common divisor which becomes , when, for each , zero is substituted for all coefficients of P_i, except the coefficient of x_i^{d_i}, for which one is substituted. Properties of the generic Macaulay resultant *The generic Macaulay resultant is an irreducible polynomial. *It is homogeneous of degree B/d_i in the coefficients of P_i, where B=d_1 \\\\cdots d_n is the Bézout bound. *The product with the resultant of every monomial of degree in x_1,\\\\dots, x_n belongs to the ideal of C[x_1,\\\\dots,x_n] generated by P_1,\\\\dots,P_n. =Resultant of polynomials over a field= From now on, we consider that the homogeneous polynomials P_1,\\\\ldots,P_n of degrees d_1,\\\\ldots,d_n have their coefficients in a field , that is that they belong to k[x_1,\\\\dots,x_n]. Their resultant is defined as the element of obtained by replacing in the generic resultant the indeterminate coefficients by the actual coefficients of the P_i. The main property of the resultant is that it is zero if and only if P_1,\\\\ldots,P_n have a nonzero common zero in an algebraically closed extension of . The \\"only if\\" part of this theorem results from the last property of the preceding paragraph, and is an effective version of Projective Nullstellensatz: If the resultant is nonzero, then :\\\\langle x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n\\\\rangle^D \\\\subseteq \\\\langle P_1,\\\\ldots,P_n\\\\rangle, where D=d_1+\\\\cdots +d_n-n+1 is the Macaulay degree, and \\\\langle x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n\\\\rangle is the maximal homogeneous ideal. This implies that P_1,\\\\ldots,P_n have no other common zero than the unique common zero, , of x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n. =Computability= As the computation of a resultant may be reduced to computing determinants and polynomial greatest common divisors, there are algorithms for computing resultants in a finite number of steps. However, the generic resultant is a polynomial of very high degree (exponential in ) depending on a huge number of indeterminates. It follows that, except for very small and very small degrees of input polynomials, the generic resultant is, in practice, impossible to compute, even with modern computers. Moreover, the number of monomials of the generic resultant is so high, that, if it would be computable, the result could not be stored on available memory devices, even for rather small values of and of the degrees of the input polynomials. Therefore, computing the resultant makes sense only for polynomials whose coefficients belong to a field or are polynomials in few indeterminates over a field. In the case of input polynomials with coefficients in a field, the exact value of the resultant is rarely important, only its equality (or not) to zero matters. As the resultant is zero if and only if the rank of the Macaulay matrix is lower than its number of its rows, this equality to zero may by tested by applying Gaussian elimination to the Macaulay matrix. This provides a computational complexity d^{O(n)}, where is the maximum degree of input polynomials. Another case where the computation of the resultant may provide useful information is when the coefficients of the input polynomials are polynomials in a small number of indeterminates, often called parameters. In this case, the resultant, if not zero, defines a hypersurface in the parameter space. A point belongs to this hyper surface, if and only if there are values of x_1, \\\\ldots,x_n which, together with the coordinates of the point are a zero of the input polynomials. In other words, the resultant is the result of the \\"elimination\\" of x_1, \\\\ldots,x_n from the input polynomials. =U-resultant = Macaulay's resultant provides a method, called \\"U-resultant\\" by Macaulay, for solving systems of polynomial equations. Given homogeneous polynomials P_1, \\\\ldots, P_{n-1}, of degrees d_1, \\\\ldots, d_{n-1}, in indeterminates x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, over a field , their U-resultant is the resultant of the polynomials P_1, \\\\ldots, P_{n-1}, P_n, where :P_n=u_1x_1 +\\\\cdots +u_nx_n is the generic linear form whose coefficients are new indeterminates u_1, \\\\ldots, u_n. Notation u_i or U_i for these generic coefficients is traditional, and is the origin of the term U-resultant. The U-resultant is a homogeneous polynomial in k[u_1, \\\\ldots, u_n]. It is zero if and only if the common zeros of P_1, \\\\ldots, P_{n-1} form a projective algebraic set of positive dimension (that is, there are infinitely many projective zeros over an algebraically closed extension of ). If the U-resultant is not zero, its degree is the Bézout bound d_1\\\\cdots d_{n-1}. The U-resultant factorizes over an algebraically closed extension of into a product of linear forms. If \\\\alpha_1u_1+\\\\ldots+\\\\alpha_nu_n is such a linear factor, then \\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n are the homogeneous coordinates of a common zero of P_1, \\\\ldots, P_{n-1}. Moreover, every common zero may be obtained from one of these linear factors, and the multiplicity as a factor is equal to the intersection multiplicity of the P_i at this zero. In other words, the U-resultant provides a completely explicit version of Bézout's theorem. Extension to more polynomials and computation The U-resultant as defined by Macaulay requires the number of homogeneous polynomials in the system of equations to be n-1, where n is the number of indeterminates. In 1981, Daniel Lazard extended the notion to the case where the number of polynomials may differ from n-1, and the resulting computation can be performed via a specialized Gaussian elimination procedure followed by symbolic determinant computation. Let P_1, \\\\ldots, P_k be homogeneous polynomials in x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, of degrees d_1, \\\\ldots, d_k, over a field . Without loss of generality, one may suppose that d_1\\\\ge d_2\\\\ge \\\\cdots \\\\ge d_k. Setting d_i=1 for , the Macaulay bound is D=d_1+\\\\cdots + d_n-n+1. Let u_1, \\\\ldots, u_n be new indeterninates and define P_{k+1}=u_1x_1+\\\\cdots +u_nx_n. In this case, the Macaulay matrix is defined to be the matrix, over the basis of the monomials in x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, of the linear map :(Q_1, \\\\ldots, Q_{k+1}) \\\\mapsto P_1Q_1+\\\\cdots+P_{k+1}Q_{k+1}, where, for each , Q_i runs over the linear space consisting of zero and the homogeneous polynomials of degree D-d_i. Reducing the Macaulay matrix by a variant of Gaussian elimination, one obtains a square matrix of linear forms in u_1, \\\\ldots, u_n. The determinant of this matrix is the U-resultant. As with the original U-resultant, it is zero if and only if P_1, \\\\ldots, P_k have infinitely many common projective zeros (that is if the projective algebraic set defined by P_1, \\\\ldots, P_k has infinitely many points over an algebraic closure of ). Again as with the original U-resultant, when this U-resultant is not zero, it factorizes into linear factors over any algebraically closed extension of . The coefficients of these linear factors are the homogeneous coordinates of the common zeros of P_1, \\\\ldots, P_k, and the multiplicity of a common zero equals the multiplicity of the corresponding linear factor. The number of rows of the Macaulay matrix is less than (ed)^n, where is the usual mathematical constant, and is the arithmetic mean of the degrees of the P_i. It follows that all solutions of a system of polynomial equations with a finite number of projective zeros can be determined in time d^{O(n)}. Although this bound is large, it is nearly optimal in the following sense: if all input degrees are equal, then the time complexity of the procedure is polynomial in the expected number of solutions (Bézout's theorem). This computation may be practically viable when , and are not large.

The Rose Atoll Marine National Monument that lies on the two outstanding islands of the Atoll is managed cooperatively between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the government of American Samoa. Fish and wildlife Rose Atoll contains the largest populations of giant clams, nesting seabirds and rare reef fish in all of American Samoa. The fish population is different from the rest of the region due to a high concentration of carnivorous fish and low concentration of herbivorous fish. Almost 270 different species of fish have been recorded in the last 15 years. Tuna, mahi-mahi, billfish, barracuda and sharks reside outside the lagoon. In deeper waters, tunicates and stalked crinoids have been spotted by scuba expeditions. Sea mammals such as the endangered humpback whale and the dolphin genus Stenella also use the waters. The atoll is a critical nesting habitat for the threatened green turtle and the endangered hawksbill turtle. The turtles migrate between American Samoa and other Pacific Island nations. Their nesting season is between the months of August and February. Approximately 97% of American Samoa's seabird population resides on Rose Atoll. Each of the 12 bird species is federally protected. Red-footed boobies and greater and lesser frigate birds nest in the buka trees. Black noddies and white terns nest in the middle and lower branches. The root system is used by reef herons and red- tailed tropic birds. Other birds can be found in the Pisonia forest, the only one left in Samoa.

The name Romana comes from a balance that was used to weigh merchandise for export. Santa Rosa de Lima is the patron saint of La Romana. The modern La Romana International Airport was opened in 2000. The city is near several other cities, such as San Pedro de Macorís and the national capital, Santo Domingo de Guzmán. The city is a hub for a growing tourist industry with several nearby local resort spots, such as the beachfront Bayahibe, Dominicus, Casa de Campo, and the growing number of golf resorts that surround the area. History The city of La Romana was founded in 1897 as an oil town. After 1917 with the construction of a large sugar-mill (owned by Italian immigrants in the region of Rome, Lazio) the economy quickly shifted to sugar production. The commissioning of the sugar mill coincided with the rise in sugar prices worldwide, prompting the sugar industry to welcome workers from other parts of the country, many poor families from the Dominican countryside moved to La Romana in search of a better life. In early 1960, Gulf and Western Industries, Inc. purchased the sugar mill and started to invest in the livestock industry which was cemented in the province. Meanwhile, $20 million were invested to rebuild La Romana and build schools, clinics, housing and other infrastructure for workers. During the mid-1970s the American conglomerate began selling its Dominican assets, and at the same time built what is now one of the largest exclusive tourist resorts in the Dominican Republic, Casa de Campo.  Tourism  Altos de Chavón Amphitheater. Casa de Campo resort complex is the flagship of the La Romana All Inclusive Resorts area. Built in 1975 by Gulf+Western to be the premiere destination in the Caribbean, it has lived up to the hype. In 1984 Casa de Campo was purchased by the Central Romana Corporation which is co-owned by the Fanjul brothers. Chavon river in La Romana, Dominican Republic. Altos de Chavón is a reconstruction of a 16th-century Mediterranean village located just minutes from La Romana.

Upon exceeding the capacity of its port, the Central Romana Corporation built its new tourism focused port on the east side of the river. The platform on the western bank was renovated and the river channel was dredged to a depth of . Inaugurated with the arrival of the vessel Costa Marina on December 2002, the Central Romana Corporation invested US$12 million to extend the existing port by over . The port is a modern platform and harbor terminal, with a capacity for two large modern cruise ships. Today the new facilities boast two docking platforms (East Dock: in length, West Dock: in length), a passenger terminal and parking facilities which accommodate 24 buses. Economy Casa de Campo Marina. La Romana has historically been a company town, with the Central Romana Corporation owning the majority of the town. It is a town with nearly 100% employment, mostly in the tourism industry or with The Central Romana Corporation, the Duty Free Zone (Zona Franca Romana), or one of the service businesses there. Romana del Oeste housing projects. La Romana has been a one-company town since the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company built the mammoth Central Romana mill in 1917. It was the only sugar operation not taken over by Rafael Trujillo during his reign. From 1964 to 1967, the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company, including properties in Florida, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic became part of the conglomerate Gulf+Western. In 1984, the Gulf+Western Corporation sold their stake in the Central Romana Corporation to a group of local and foreign investors which includes the Fanjul brothers. Gulf+Western acquired Consolidated Cigar in 1968 and shifted the Canary Island cigar-making operation to its Tabacalera de Garcia tobacco plant in La Romana. The Tabacalera de Garcia factory is currently one of the largest cigar factories in the world, and has been owned by the biggest cigar marketing company in the world, Altadis, since 1999. Three world-famous brands are produced in La Romana: Montecristo, H. Upmann, and Romeo y Julieta. This town is characterized by its tremendous influence in the country's tourism programs. It's filled with beautiful beaches and many hotels and resorts. There are also many growing suburban areas and fenced communities This town has a large population, and all the problems associated with high-density areas. It does not have many notable sights in terms of architecture or urban spaces, being barely 100 years old. It grew very fast compared to the much older and slower- paced La Vega or Seibo, which are more typical Dominican towns. Climate Sports Estadio Francisco Micheli is home to the Toros del Este, a baseball team in the Dominican Winter League. In 1983, the government of Salvador Jorge Blanco, through the fund for development of this region, built the Polideportivo de La Romana (La Romana Sports Center), which was named after Eleoncio Mercedes in honor of the flyweight boxer who became world champion. The Cañeros de La Romana, a Dominican basketball team, play their home games here.

It is written in the Chagatai language, known to Babur as \\"Turki\\" (meaning Turkic), the spoken language of the Andijan-Timurids. During Emperor Akbar's reign, the work was completely translated to Persian, the usual literary language of the Mughal court, by a Mughal courtier, Abdul Rahīm, in AH 998 (1589–90). Translations into many other languages followed, mostly from the 19th century onwards. Bābur was an educated Timurid prince and his observations and comments in his memoirs reflect an interest in nature, society, politics and economics. His vivid account of events covers not just his own life, but the history and geography of the areas he lived in as well as the people with whom he came into contact. The book covers topics as diverse as astronomy, geography, statecraft, military matters, weapons and battles, plants and animals, biographies and family chronicles, courtiers and artists, poetry, music and paintings, wine parties, historical monument tours as well as contemplations on human nature. Though Babur himself does not seem to have commissioned any illustrated versions, his grandson began as soon as he was presented with the finished Persian translation in November 1589. The first of four illustrated copies made under Akbar over the following decade or so was broken up for sale in 1913. Some 70 miniatures are dispersed among various collections, with 20 in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The three other versions, partly copied from the first, are in the National Museum, New Delhi (almost complete, dated 1597-98), British Library (143 out of an original 183 miniatures, probably early 1590s) with a miniature over two pages in the British Museum,Losty, 39; British Museum page and a copy, mostly lacking the text, with the largest portions in the State Museum of Eastern Cultures, Moscow (57 folios) and the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore (30 miniatures).Losty, 39, with pages at 40-44 Various other collections have isolated miniatures from these versions. Later illustrated manuscripts were also made, though not on as a grand a scale. Babur is at the centre of most scenes shown. As far is known, no contemporary images of him survive, but from whatever sources they had Akbar's artists devised a fairly consistent representation of him, \\"with a roundish face and droopy moustache\\", wearing a Central Asian style of turban and a short-sleeved coat over a robe with long sleeves.Crill and Jariwala, 60 Coming from a period after Akbar's workshop had developed their new style of Mughal painting, the illustrated Baburnamas show developments such as landscape views with recession, influenced by Western art seen at court.Crill and Jariwala, 24-26 Generally the scenes are less crowded than in earlier miniatures of \\"historical\\" scenes. Akbar's manuscripts Most images trimmed of borders File:2006AT3750 (cropped).jpgVictoria and Albert Museum: Babur and a group of men including his son, Humayun, the next emperor were encamped near Bagram and were told that a rhinoceros had been seen nearby.

According to historian Stephen Frederic Dale, Babur's Chagatai prose is highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology, and vocabulary, and also contains many phrases and smaller poems in Persian. The Bāburnāma begins abruptly with these plain words:English translation Bābur describes his fluctuating fortunes as a minor ruler in Central Asia – he took and lost Samarkand twice – and his move to Kabul in 1504. There is a break in all known manuscripts between 1508 and 1519. Annette Beveridge and other scholars believe that the missing part in the middle, and perhaps an account of Babur's earlier childhood, a preface and perhaps an epilogue, were written but the manuscript of those parts lost by the time of Akbar.Beveridge, xxxii, xxxvii-xxxviii There are various points in his highly active career, and that of his son Humayun, where parts of the original manuscript might plausibly have been lost.Beveridge, xxxv Ḥamzah Sulṭān, Mahdī Sulṭan and Mamāq Sulṭān pay homage to Babur By 1519 Bābur is established in Kabul and from there launches an invasion into north-western India. The final section of the Bāburnāma covers the years 1525 to 1529 and the establishment of the Mughal empire over what was by his death still a relatively small part of north-western India, which Bābur's descendants would expand and rule for three centuries. The account of the decisive First Battle of Panipat in 1526 is followed by long descriptions of India, its people, fauna and flora. Various exciting incidents are recounted and illustrated: Babur jumps off his horse just in time to avoid following it into a river, and when his army has formed its boats into a circle a fish jumps into a boat to escape from a crocodile.Losty, 44 The original Chagatai language text does not seem to have existed in many copies, and those that survive are mostly partial. The copy seen in the Mughal Library in the 1620s, and presumably used to base the Persian translation on, seems to have been lost.Beveridge, xxxix- xliii Translations It was first translated into English by John Leyden and William Erskine as Memoirs of Zehir-Ed-Din Muhammed Baber: Emperor of Hindustan and later by the British orientalist scholar Annette Beveridge. Widely translated, the Bāburnāma forms part of textbooks in no fewer than 25 countries – mostly in Central, Western, and Southern Asia. Context Babur, during his second Hindustan campaign, riding a raft from Kunar back to Atar The Baburnama fits into a tradition of imperial autobiographies or official court biographies, seen in various parts of the world. In South Asia these go back to the Ashokavadana and Harshacharita from ancient India, the medieval Prithviraj Raso, and were continued by the Mughals with the Akbarnama (biography), Tuzk-e-Jahangiri or Jahangir-nameh (memoirs), and Shahjahannama (genre of flattering biographies). Akbar's ancestor Timur had been celebrated in a number of works, mostly called Zafarnama (\\"Book of Victories\\"), the best known of which was also produced in an illustrated copy in the 1590s by Akbar's workshop. A work purporting to be Timur's autobiography, which turned up in Jahangir's library in the 1620s, is now regarded as a fake of that period. Praise Babur's autobiography has received widespread acclaim from modern scholars. Quoting Henry Beveridge, Stanley Lane-Poole writes: Lane- Poole goes on to write: Writing about the time Babur came to India, the historian Bamber Gascoigne comments:  Illustrations from the Manuscript of Baburnama (Memoirs of Babur)  File:The battle of Sultan Ḥusayn Mīrzā against Sultan Masʿūd Mīrzā at Hiṣṣār.jpgThe battle of Sultan Ḥusayn Mīrzā against Sultan Masʿūd Mīrzā at Hiṣṣār File:Animals of Hindustan small deer and cows called gīnī, from Illuminated manuscript Baburnama (Memoirs of Babur).jpgAnimals of Hindustan small deer and cows called gīnī, Walters File:Illuminated Manuscript Baburnamah.jpgForay to Kohat, Walters  Notes   References  * Beveridge, Annette, Introduction to her translation, The Babur-nama in English (Memoirs of Babur) at Internet Archive *Crill, Rosemary, and Jariwala, Kapil.

As a composer, he is best known for scoring Brave Fencer Musashi (1998), Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children (2005) and The Last Remnant (2008). He also plays the guitar in the rock bands The Black Mages and The Star Onions; both groups arrange and perform compositions from the Final Fantasy series. Biography Tsuyoshi Sekito was born in Osaka, Japan. His career as a video game composer began at the end of the 1980s when he joined Konami's sound team. The first game he scored was Space Manbow in 1989. The following year, he created the music for SD Snatcher and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake along with several other composers. He was subsequently assigned to score the sports titles Double Dribble: 5-on-5 (1991) and Soccer Superstars (1995) and the cartoon adaptations Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers (1991) and Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster's Hidden Treasure (1993), often as the leading composer. In 1994, he created the soundtrack to the arcade game Lethal Enforcers II: Gunfighters with Yuichi Sakakura. He left Konami in 1995 to join the Osaka branch of Square. After joining Square, Sekito did not compose any games until 1998; his first assignment for the company was to create the music for Brave Fencer Musashi. In 1999, he assisted in scoring the soundtrack to Chocobo's Dungeon 2 by creating 12 pieces. His fellow composers were Kumi Tanioka and Kenji Ito. The following year, he composed music for the Japan-only All Star Pro-Wrestling along with Kenichiro Fukui and Tanioka. Sekito went solo for the game's sequel, All Star Pro-Wrestling II (2001), and was joined by Fukui again for the third and final installment, All Star Pro-Wrestling III (2003). In 2002, after Sekito and Fukui's collaboration on All Star Pro-Wrestling, they decided to arrange some of the pieces in the Final Fantasy series, composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The two presented their arrangements to Uematsu who enjoyed their work. Although hesitant at first, Uematsu agreed to join Sekito and Fukui in forming the rock band The Black Mages; Sekito served as the group's guitarist. In 2003, Keiji Kawamori, Arata Hanyuda, and Michio Okamiya also joined the band. The Black Mages have released three studio albums, and have appeared at several concerts to promote their albums. To create the music for The Last Remnant, Sekito utilized his guitar collection for different tracks and used different guitar sounds and techniques including detuning and delay effects on the album. Sekito did not use an orchestra for the games music, but chose particular instruments and players to make the music an assortment of the best for each part. In Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, Sekito felt unrestricted while composing music for the Nintendo 3DS, saying that he was able to create songs that would make a game player feel that were in a large world even on a small device due to the game consoles 3D graphics. For the game Final Fantasy Explorers, Sekito had to begin composing music with very few visual effects finished, and thus composed a wide variety of music to fit however it turned out. Musical style and influences Sekito cites heavy metal bands Van Halen and Dream Theater and film score composer Jerry Goldsmith as musical influences.

The serial presents a more authentic version of the character than most other film adaptations, with Tarzan as a cultured and well educated gentleman as in the original Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. It was filmed during the same period as the Johnny Weissmuller/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Tarzan films. Film exhibitors had the choice of booking the serial in 12 episodes, as a feature film, also called The New Adventures of Tarzan, or as the feature film followed by 11 episodes of the serial. The serial was partly filmed in Guatemala, and Tarzan was played by Herman Brix (known post-war as Bruce Bennett). The final screenplay was credited to Charles F. Royal, and from Episode 6 onward, also Basil Dickey. It was produced by Ashton Dearholt, Bennett Cohen and George W. Stout under the corporate name of “Burroughs- Tarzan Enterprises, Inc.” (which also distributed) and was directed by Edward Kull and Wilbur F. McGaugh. Plot The original version of the plot proposed involvement of munitions runners and government agents, focussing more on the super-explosive formula hidden in the idol. This was re-written during production but some elements remain, such as the otherwise nonsensical final chapter name \\"Operator No. 17\\" and Ula Vale's unexplained periodic use of disguises in the first few chapters (Ula Vale was originally written as a government agent using \\"Operator No. 17\\" as her codename; and this plot element was dropped from the revised script, but only after some scenes from the earlier shooting script had been filmed, along with the main title cards). Several plot elements bring the characters together in search (and pursuit) of the Guatemalan idol known as The Green Goddess: Tarzan's friend D'Arnot has crash landed in the region and is in the hands of a lost tribe of jungle natives; Major Martling is leading an expedition to find the fabled artefact for a powerful explosives formula hidden within it; Ula Vale's fiancé died in an earlier expedition to rescue the artefact for its archaeological benefit and so she starts one of her own in his honour; and Raglan has been sent by Hiram Powers, Ula's lawyer, to steal the valuable idol for himself. In addition to containing the explosives formula, the idol also holds a fortune in jewels. Tarzan, Ula and Major Martling locate the lost city containing the idol and rescue D'Arnot from the natives that worship it in the 70-minute-long first episode. However, Raglan escapes with the Green Goddess and heads through the jungle for the coast. Tarzan and the others pursue him across the jungle, encountering many perils, including recapture by the natives to whom the idol belonged. The adventures end out at sea where, during a hurricane, they are able to permanently secure the idol while Raglan is killed by another of Powers' agents because of his failures. The murderer perishes when the ship sinks. Returning to Greystoke Manor in England with Tarzan, Ula consigns the explosives formula to fire in the final episode, where she and Tarzan also recount several adventures from the first part of the serial to an assembled party of friends and colleagues. Cast Herman Brix as Tarzan *Herman Brix as Tarzan, or Lord Greystoke, who travels from Africa to Guatemala to rescue his friend, French Lt. d'Arnot, who bailed out of his plane just before it crashed, following a lightning strike, into the uncharted jungles of Guatemala and he is believed to be held by a tribe of lost natives. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. had suggested Herman Brix to MGM to play Tarzan. However, Brix broke his shoulder filming Touchdown for Paramount and, because his recovery period was uncertain, MGM cast Johnny Weissmuller in Tarzan the Ape Man instead.ERBZine: New Adventures of Tarzan, retrieved 25th June 2007 Sources disagree about Burroughs' involvement with Brix's casting. Some stated that Brix was hand picked for this serial by Burroughs while others state that it was Dearholt who cast Brix and he only briefly met Burroughs afterwards for a handshake and some photographs.Herman Brix obituary at the Washington Post, retrieved 2nd July 2007 Official biography of Herman Brix Brix was never paid for his work on this film and after the war changed his name to \\"Bruce Bennett\\" in order to escape typecasting and work in quality projects again. *Ula Holt as Ula Vale, on her own expedition to find the Green Goddess in memory of her fiancé, who died in d'Arnot's crashed plane flying to Guatemala to find the Goddess. This was not Holt's only known film role. She was discovered by, and soon married, the producer, Ashton Dearholt. In the original version, the character was to be revealed as government agent Operator 17, but this was changed during production. *Ashton Dearholt as P.B. Raglan, a mercenary villain sent by one Hiram Powers to steal the valuable Green Goddess. Dearholt is also the producer of this serial. According to the pressbook, he had to take the role at the last minute after the original actor, Don Castello, became ill.BBC: The New Adventures of Tarzan, retrieved 25th June 2007Allmovie, retrieved 2nd July 2007 In reality, \\"Don Costello\\" was merely a pseudonym chosen by Dearholt, who had previously starred himself in several silent films of his own making, and planned all along to do so here. *Frank Baker as Major Francis Martling, archaeologist leader of another expedition to find the Green Goddess, with whom Tarzan and Ula Vale join forces. *Lewis Sargent as George, bumbling comic relief; Major Martling's assistant. *Jiggs as Nkima, Tarzan's chimpanzee. Nkima, rather than Cheeta, is the name of Tarzan's animal companion in Burroughs' books, though in the books he is a monkey rather than a chimp. Jiggs earned $2,000 for this role. *Dale Walsh as Alice Martling, The Major's daughter who accompanies him on his expedition. *Harry Ernest as Gordon Hamilton, Alice's fiancé and also part of Martling's expedition. The original draft story called for Gordon and Alice to become separated from the expedition and hunted and arrested by Guatemalan authorities as gun runners. However this entangling subplot was dropped, and Gordon and Alice both return to America in the third episode, along with d'Arnot, and are not seen again excepting some incidental shots in the final episode. *Jackie Genry as Queen Maya, leader of the natives of the Lost City, who, in the first chapter, offers Tarzan a chance to become her \\"consort\\" in lieu of being executed along with his captured friends, only to find herself sternly rebuffed; and who in unexplainedly missing from the Lost City during scenes set there in a later episode. In real life, Ms. Gentry was the wife of Tony Gentry, Nkima's trainer and handler. *Jack Mower as Captain Blade, in the eleventh chapter, a schooner-master associate of Raglan's who eventually turns on that villain before meeting his own demise in a shipwrecking hurricane. *Merrill McCormick as Bouchart, in the first chapter, who comes to Africa to alert Tarzan to d'Arnot's disappearance; and also as \\"Pedro\\", a Guatemalan associate of Ula Vale. *Unidentified Players who include the actors portraying D'Arnot (although, possibly the actor was Jean DeBriac), Tarzan's friend; Hiram Powers, Raglan's boss back in Africa; Padre Muller, Martling's priest-contact in Chichicastenango; and several prominent henchmen, including two who bedevil Tarzan by tossing him from a balcony, then later bind him tightly to a massive tree trunk. Production =Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises= In 1929, a would-be movie entrepreneur, Ashton Dearholt, arranged an introduction to Edgar Rice Burroughs, using his wife's friendship with Burroughs' daughter. Dearholt had held several jobs within the film industry during the 1920s, and had even produced, directed and starred in a brief series of western films. As of 1929, he was familiar with Burroughs' work and wanted to get the rights to one of Burroughs' several singleton novels and film it in conjunction with RKO-Pathé. Burroughs, long dissatisfied with Hollywood's treatment of his Tarzan character, refused but took a liking to Dearholt personally and they became friends. MGM's contract with Burroughs was for just two pictures and this had run out with Tarzan and His Mate. In the Summer of 1934, Dearholt and two business associates, George W. Stout, Bennett Cohen approached Burroughs to make an independent company, Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises, through which Dearholt and his partners would make films from Burroughs' works as they had been written, while Burroughs could use the business to coordinate his numerous other Tarzan-related products, organizations and franchises. Burroughs agreed, as he believed would receive a much larger amount of money than in his previous contracts with (MGM, which had made several million with their two Tarzan films despite only paying Burroughs about $75,000). Dearholt quickly outlined a story, which he called Tarzan and the Green Goddess, based on which Charles F. Royal and Edwin Blum then wrote the screen treatment, renaming it Tarzan in Guatemala. as Guatemala had been chosen by Dearholt as the film's location. He had visited that country in 1933 as a trouble-shooter for RKO Pictures and felt that he knew enough about the country, had the contacts there including within the government, and could make the film far more economically than in Hollywood. Therefore, in late 1934, Dearholt \\"led an expedition\\" of 29 cast and crew, with several tons of freight, aboard the liner Seattle to begin filming in highland ruins in Guatemala. The expedition almost never got started, however, as Dearholt's personal credit would not support the loan he estimated as needed to make the picture. Burroughs had to reluctantly involve himself as co-signatory and the loan was approved the day before the party was due to sail. Far from being the low-cost, exotically- located, adventurous film-making experience Dearholt anticipated, this decision caused unusual production problems. When the cast and crew arrived in Guatemala there was no harbour so they had to be shuttled ashore by boats across three miles of sea during a storm. Once there, they were held up by customs and security officers of President Jorge Ubico, whose assistance Dearholt had counted on and even had him written into the serial's final episode as a character (whether he intended to ask the Presidente to play himself is not known). Once ashore, the party was housed in a hotel with no in-room plumbing, having to use outhouses \\"stacked\\" alongside each story of the structure. It then took 18 hours to travel the 100 miles to Chichicastenango, on a plateau 6,447 ft above sea level. The production then moved on to Lake Atitlán, Tikal, and to Guatemala City.Pressbook material from ERBZine: New Adventures of Tarzan, retrieved 25 June 2007 Guatemala had no motion picture industry of its own, so everywhere they went, the company had to carry tons of equipment brought with them from the States, including an enormous sound truck which was not designed for the winding, dirt mountain highways which made up most of the country's transit infrastructure. Tropical diseases abounded and apparently every cast member was stricken at least once and laid up, unable to work, for weeks. The local wildlife was also a problem. According to an interview with Herman Brix in the Christian Science Monitor (1999), \\"there was only a single sharpshooter up in the trees to keep the croc away from me.\\" The local climate became another problem when the production was affected by tropical storms and some film was damaged by the humid environment of the very real jungle. The loan obtained in California was used up long before the picture was finished, and the expedition evidently had to waste additional time hiding from local creditors and the police in the jungles before returning to California, where the picture was finished. Nevertheless, the film was finished in four months, with the title changed again to The New Adventures of Tarzan. =Filming locations= In spite of the difficulties faced while filming in the jungles, most of the places visited by the filming crew and actors were served by the American company International Railways of Central America (IRCA). In 1935, the railroad service in Guatemala was at its peak, controlled by the American IRCA, and had major stations at Puerto San José, Guatemala City and Puerto Barrios, which allowed the crew to transport their equipment easily to these locations. The only difficult locations to reach were Chichicastenango and Tikal, since there were no IRCA services available to those places, although there was airline service to Peten available.

She was named Florence Watson, but he rechristened her Ula Holt. He brought her back to Los Angeles with him and installed her in the Dearholt household. Dearholt's wife, Florence Gilbert, left with their two children, and eventually filed for divorce shortly before the expedition's departure. While filming, Edgar Rice Burroughs divorced his wife Emma Hubert and married Florence Gilbert, 30-years his junior, on 4 April 1935, after which they escaped to Hawaii for their honeymoon. He would write in his personal diary that he had fallen in love with Florence when she accompanied Dearholt to his first meeting with Burroughs in 1929.Ashton Dearholt biography at the Internet Movie Database, retrieved 25 June 2007 Burroughs decided that he needed immediate money and that Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises was not going to make it for him after all. He re-optioned MGM's contract for a third Weissmuller film and approved the sale of three of Sol Lesser's remaining four options to MGM, who agreed to make a large \\"authorisation payment\\" to Burroughs. (Sol Lesser had acquired options for five Tarzan productions from a defunct company, the first of which he used to make Tarzan the Fearless in direct competition with MGM's films.) MGM paid Lesser $500,000 for his options and paid Burroughs $25–50,000 per film. Most modern reference sources allege that MGM campaigned to undermine their new film rival by threatening that theaters showing the Dearholt serial would not be allowed to show the third MGM film when it was released. However, no reference to such a campaign can be found in any primary contemporary resources, including Variety, The Film Daily, The Motion Picture Exhibitor or even the New York Times, all of which reviewed the film and covered its filming progress; and modern sources, which have relied heavily on pressbook material and rank assumptions by each other for other aspects of the serial's \\"history\\", do not provide any reference source for this allegation. Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises tried to make its serial more lucrative by releasing it in two different formats. The first involved having the first episode with a 65-minute running time and encouraging theater owners to book it as the \\"feature\\" film on a program with the last episode of a previous serial, with the remaining eleven episodes to follow; and the second was by creating a 70-minute feature film from the first episode and its cliffhanger resolution in the second chapter, plus a brief sequence showing the capture of Raglan, which could either be booked also as a longer first episode (to be followed by the remaining eleven) or as a stand- alone feature. Reports of use of yet another first episode being cut and played against seven subsequent episodes cannot be verified. In any event this plan was not successful in the USA. New Adventures of Tarzan was the last Tarzan serial ever produced. However the serial did much better abroad, especially in England, where it was re-released following World War II with its first episode shortened to 45 minutes, and its two feature versions also edited, all at the hands of E. J. Fancey's New Realm Pictures, Ltd. These truncated versions later became staples of U.S. television and even later videotape and DVA printings, to the extent that the original editions may be considered lost, at least to the general public: even the \\"restored\\" version issued in 2019 on DVD by The Roan Group has only the abridged first episode. Only one Beta videotape of the serial, marketed in the 1980s by Nostalgia Family Merchant, is known to have included the complete first episode. Fancey also dubbed, or re-dubbed, the first feature version, the poor quality of which he excused by adding an \\"apology\\" to the credits which claimed the problem was due to \\"variable atmospheric conditions\\" in Guatemala which had affected the original recording: in fact, the original release material contain no such apology and prints made from the original material have an adequate sound track. =Tarzan's Yell= Herman Brix posing for the Tarzan yell in the opening credits of the serial This serial features an alternate version of the famous Tarzan yell. This version is variously described as a rising pitch \\"Man-gan-i\\" or \\"Tar-man-gan-i\\" sound. The \\"Tar-man-gan-i\\" version originally comes from the 1932 Tarzan radio serial starring James Pierce.ERBZine: The Tarzan Yell, retrieved 25th June 2007 In the ape language used in the Burroughs' Tarzan novels, \\"Tarmangani\\" means \\"Great White Ape\\". MGM's Johnny Weissmuller films, featuring the now standard yell, had been in production for some time when this serial was created, starting with Tarzan the Ape Man (1932).The original version of the plot involved munitions runners and government agents, focussing more on the super-explosive formula hidden in the idol. This was re-written during production but some elements remain, such as the otherwise nonsensical final chapter name \\"Operator No. 17\\" (Ula Vale was originally written as a government agent using \\"Operator No. 17\\" as her codename but this entire plot line was dropped from the final script). =Stunts and effects= Brix performed his own stunts in the serial, including swinging from real jungle vines, but this presented further problems. Despite testing a vine for safety beforehand with a 200 lb weight, when Brix tried himself, with a run up, he over shot the pool of water he was meant to land in. \\"I still have the scars from that fall,\\" he told the Monitor. The scene where Brix bursts the ropes binding him is real. Critical reception Reviews in the United States were poor. There may have been suspicions that this was due to MGM's influence over the trade media, but with the low budget, major financial difficulties, and problems with the Guatemalan government while on location, it may just have been its fate as an independent picture. Variety, for example, said that \\"limpid direction makes it fall way short of even the limited possibilities of an independent production.\\" The Motion Picture Herald, however, described is as \\"spectacular and authentic.\\" The film was more of a success outside the United States, possibly due to MGM's lack of control in those markets. According to Gabe Essoe, \\"on the strength of the one picture alone, Brix became twentieth in popularity in France and Britain.\\" Despite its problems, the film was successful enough that a second feature film, Tarzan and the Green Goddess, was released in 1938. It was based on footage from the last ten chapters of the serial, with some minor additions, and follows much the same plot. William C. Cline believes The New Adventures of Tarzan to be the best of the Tarzan serials.

The ship served as the Greek flagship during most of the first half of the century. Although popularly known as a battleship (θωρηκτό) in Greek, she is in fact an armored cruiser (θωρακισμένο καταδρομικό),However she was usually classified as a battlecruiser after the Washington Naval Treaty (1922) because her displacement and main armament slightly exceeded the limits imposed on cruisers. the only ship of this type still in existence. The ship was initially ordered by the Italian Regia Marina, but budgetary constraints led Italy to offer it for sale to international customers. With the bequest of the wealthy benefactor George Averoff as down payment, Greece acquired the ship in 1909. Launched in 1910, Averof arrived in Greece in September 1911. The most modern warship in the Aegean at the time, she served as the flagship of admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis in the First Balkan War, and played a major role in the establishment of Greek predominance over the Ottoman Navy and the incorporation of many Aegean islands to Greece. The ship continued to serve in World War I, the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, and the interwar period, receiving a modernization in France in 1925 to 1927. Following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, Averof participated in the exodus of the Greek fleet to Egypt. Hopelessly obsolete and prone to mechanical breakdowns, she nevertheless spent the next three years as a convoy escort and guard ship in the Indian Ocean and at the Suez Canal. In October 1944, she carried the Greek government in exile back to liberated Athens, after the withdrawal of the German army. In 1952, she was decommissioned, before being moved to Poros, where she was berthed from 1956 to 1983. From 1984 until today, she has been reinstated on active duty as museum ship in the Naval Tradition Park in Faliro. After maintenance in late 2017, she achieved seaworthiness state once again, allowing the ship to sail (towed) accompanied by Greek frigate Kountouriotis (F-462) (Φ/Γ Κουντουριώτης) to Thessaloniki Greece where she received more than 130,000 visitors over her 53-day stay. History =Construction and arrival in Greece= Right elevation and plan drawing of Georgios Averof from Brassey's Naval Annual 1915 At the beginning of the 20th century, Greece decided to reinforce its fleet, whose ships were fast becoming obsolete due to the rapidly advancing naval technology of the era. The navy procured eight destroyers (then a relatively new type of ship) between 1905–1907, but the most important addition was the armored cruiser Georgios Averof. Like her Italian sisters and , she was being built at Orlando Shipyards, Livorno, Italy. When the Italian government cancelled the third ship of the class due to budgetary concerns, the Greek government immediately stepped in and bought her with a one-third downpayment (ca. 300,000 gold pound sterling), the bequest of a wealthy Greek benefactor, Georgios Averof, whose name she consequently received. Launching of Averof, 12 March 1910 Averof fitting out, summer 1910, in Livorno, Italy The Averof was fitted with a combination of Italian engines, French boilers, British guns, and German generators.www.bsaverof.com The most discernible difference between the cruiser and her Italian sisters was the shape of her six gun turrets. The Averof encased her British-built guns in rounded pillbox-form housings with convex roof plates. She was also fitted with a foremast, which her sister- ships did not receive until after the start of the First World War. Such was the urgency of the Greek Navy to see the ship in service, that they accepted her with a gouge inside one of the gun barrels. This had been caused by the slip of a rifling tool, but Armstrong Whitworth's chief ordnance engineer correctly judged the defect as inconsequential to the weapon's performance and safety. The Averof was launched on 12 March 1910. She would be the last commissioned armored cruiser in the world, a class of warship that had already been rendered obsolete by the battlecruiser. Her first captain, Ioannis Damianos, took command on 16 May 1911, and the Averof immediately sailed to England for the Coronation Naval Review of King George V. While there, she would also receive the first load of ammunition for her British-built guns. The stay in England was troubled by running aground at Spithead on 19 June, which forced her into drydock. While waiting for repairs, her crew was involved in a large brawl with the locals, caused by their unfamiliarity with the mould found on edible blue cheese. Captain Damianos was deemed inadequate to maintain discipline, and replaced by the esteemed taskmaster, Pavlos Kountouriotis. During the journey home, Captain Kountouriotis thoroughly trained his crew, with the exception of gunnery practice, as ammunition was limited to special deliveries from Britain. The Averof finally reached Faliro Bay, near Athens, on 1 September 1911. At that time, she was the most modern and powerful warship in the navies of the Balkan League or the Ottoman Empire. =Balkan Wars= Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, 1920 With the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912, Kountouriotis was named rear admiral and commander-in-chief of the Hellenic Royal Navy. Averof, under Captain Sofoklis Dousmanis, served as the flagship of the fleet, and she took part in the takeover of the islands of the northern and eastern Aegean. During the naval battles at Elli (3 December 1912) and Lemnos (5 January 1913) against the Ottoman Navy, she almost single-handedly secured victory and the undisputed control of the Aegean Sea for Greece. In both battles, due to her superior speed, armor and armament, she left the battle line and pursued the Turkish Fleet alone. During the Battle of Elli, Kountouriotis, frustrated by the slow speed of the three older Greek battleships, hoisted the Flag Signal for the letter Z which stood for \\"Independent Action\\", and sailed forward alone, with a speed of against the Turkish fleet. Averof succeeded in crossing the T of the Turkish fleet and concentrated her fire against the Ottoman flagship, thus forcing the Ottoman fleet to retreat in disorder. Likewise, during the Battle of Lemnos, when the older battleships failed to follow up with Averof, Kountouriotis did not hesitate to pursue independent action. Averof in dark gray paint, In each battle the ship suffered only slight damage, while inflicting severe damage to several Turkish ships. These exploits propelled her and her Admiral to legendary status in Greece. After the Battle of Lemnos, the crew of Averof affectionately nicknamed her \\"Lucky Uncle George\\". It is a notable fact that, due to the aforementioned need to conserve ammunition which had to be secured from Britain, Averof fired her guns for the first time during the Battle of Elli. Georgios Averof is credited with successfully closing the Aegean Sea to Ottoman transports bringing fresh troops and supplies to the front during the First Balkan War. This success had a concrete impact on the land action where the Ottoman forces suffered decisive defeats. It is hypothesized that in the lack of such decisive control of the sea by the Greek Navy, the Ottoman Empire might have reinforced its forces on the Balkan Peninsula and therefore fared better in the war.Ozturk, Cagri., \\"For Want of a Horseshoe: Alternate Histories of Turkey That Fared Better in the First Balkan War\\", paper presented at The Centenary of the Balkan Wars (1912–1913): Contested Stances Conference, 23–24 May 2013, Middle East Technical University, Ankara. =World War I and aftermath= Averof off the coast of Crete, 1919 Averof at Coronation Naval Review, Spithead, 1937 During World War I, Averof did not see much active service, as Greece was neutral during the first years of the war, and in deep internal turmoil (see National Schism). After the Noemvriana riots of 1916, she was seized by the French, and only returned after Greece formally entered the war on the side of the Allies in June 1917. After the armistice, Averof sailed with other Allied warships to Constantinople, where she received an ecstatic welcome from the city's many Greeks. Under Rear Admiral Ioannis Ipitis, the cruiser continued to serve as flagship of the Royal Hellenic Navy. During the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), she supported troop landings in Eastern Thrace, bombarded the Turkish Black Sea coastline, and helped to evacuate refugees after the Greek Army's defeat. From 1925 to 1927, the cruiser underwent a major refit in France, during which she received modern anti-aircraft armament, a new tripod-foremast and conning tower, improved fire-control equipment, and an overhaul of her engines, boilers, and furnaces. The ship's obsolete 17-inch torpedo tubes were also removed. Given her age, the cost of converting the vessel to fuel-oil firing was considered prohibitive. On 20 May 1937, Averof joined the warships of fourteen other nations at the Coronation Naval Review in Spithead, England. She was the only one of the 150 vessels present which had also attended the previous coronation review in 1911. King George VI was reminded of the fact, as he warmly welcomed Averofs captain, during the preliminary introduction of Britain's naval guests. =World War II and aftermath= Averof in camouflage paint, RN Bombay Station, 1942 In the early morning of 18 April 1941, after the collapse of the Greco-German front, the Averofs crew disobeyed direct orders to scuttle the ship in preventing her possible capture by the enemy. They cut through a closed harbor-boom with axes and handsaws to let the vessel escape, and their commanding officer dramatically embarked up a rope ladder to join them as the vessel was underway. Under the constant threat of Luftwaffe air strikes (which had sunk many Greek and British warships during the evacuation), the cruiser sailed to Souda Bay, Crete. Then on to the UK naval station at Alexandria, arriving in Egypt on 23 April. Averof in dazzle paint 1941–1942 Averof at Port Said, 23 February 1943 While too slow to serve with the British Fleet in the Mediterranean, and also lacking sufficient anti- aircraft armament for that theatre of operation, the old armored cruiser was considered quite appropriate for escorting Indian Ocean convoys. In this capacity, she could offer more firepower than a contemporary heavy cruiser (albeit with less gunnery range), and twice their respective armour protection, quite sufficient to deal with the threat posed by German raiders operating in the sector. This task also required no more speed than her then greatly reduced maximum of 12 knots. So from September 1941 through October 1942, under British control, she was assigned to convoy escort and patrol duties in the Indian Ocean and based at Bombay. The Averof left Alexandria on 30 June and passed through the Suez Canal to Port Tewfiq (Port Suez). The three weeks spent there saw her crew involved in the rescue of sailors and soldiers aboard the Cunard Line troopship MV Georgic, which was set ablaze and sunk at an adjacent berth during a Luftwaffe air raid on 6 July. With several of her boilers deactivated, and the fuel-oil spraying mechanism for her coal furnaces now inoperable, the Averof was then capable of only 9 knots, insufficient for her planned convoy duties. So on 20 July, the ship departed for Port Sudan, where she underwent three weeks of emergency repairs to her oil-accelerant apparatus, raising her cruising speed to the required minimum. The vessel then resumed her passage of the Red Sea and reached the port of Aden, in late-August. From there, she sailed in an unassigned convoy crossing of the Indian Ocean, arriving at Bombay on 10 September 1941. As the Averof had not seen an overhaul of her boilers and furnaces since 1926, mechanical problems continued to plague the vessel and ultimately cut short her usefulness in convoy service. On 28 September she was assigned to escort an oil tanker convoy (BP.16) from Bombay to Basra in the Persian Gulf, but was detached before completing the voyage due to faulty boilers. This was of extra concern because on 24 September, the German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran had sunk the Stamatios G. Embiricos at the equator, ending three months of raider inactivity in the sector. By the time the Averof was forced to leave her convoy, the Greek freighter was already four days overdue to Columbo, Ceylon, meaning the enemy would have had a week to sail in any direction from the Embiricos' last known position. However, the Kormoran had moved southeast towards Australia (and her fateful meeting with HMAS Sydney), and convoy BP.16 reached Basra safely on 5 October. The Averof returned to Bombay on 4 October, where the cruiser underwent emergency repairs. On 20 December, she finally sailed again from Bombay to “cover” a troop-support convoy (BM.31B) headed for Singapore with a stop at Columbo. Here she was detached, returning to Bombay on 5 January 1942. On 9 January the Averof again put to sea in advance of the unescorted departures of six troopships from Bombay and Karachi, headed for Basra (BP.31A – 31B). The cruiser could not hope to keep up with these vessels, traveling at 14 to 16 knots, so she was once again designated as a patrol vessel (“defensive cover”) for the sea lane in which they would eventually overtake her. Turning in the Gulf of Oman, the Averofs lookout spotted a modern freighter appearing to shadow the warship at a safe distance. The cruiser went to “battle stations” over the possible sighting of a merchant raider, but the suspicious vessel altered course and sped away. This incident appears to have prompted a call for gunnery practice after the ship returned to Bombay on 15 January. During these exercises in the bay outside the harbor, the recoil from one of the Averofs eight-gun broadsides fractured the mounts on two of her active boilers and sent them crashing to the deck. The vessel limped into port for major repairs and did not venture out again until she departed Bombay in early November 1942. By then, she had been dubbed, “Georgios Never-off”, by the base’s Royal Navy personnel. Again repaired to a cruising capability of 12 knots, she sailed for Port Said, Egypt, in an independent passage of the Arabian and Red Seas, and took up duties as a Suez Canal guard ship from mid-November 1942. Averoff in Piraeus, 20 October 1944 Averof was the only World War I-era armored cruiser to serve in her original capacity during World War II (several old Japanese vessels of the type acted as training ships, or were converted for minelaying). While her 9.2-inch British-built ordnance was no longer in sea service with the Royal Navy, many of these weapons had been moved to coastal batteries and their shells were readily available. The British 7.5-inch naval gun was still employed on three of the Royal Navy's Hawkins-class heavy cruisers, as well as shore installations, so its ammunition also remained in production. However, this was not to prove a factor in Averofs viability, as she was never again required to fire her guns in anger. On 17 October 1944, once again as the flagship of the exiled Hellenic Navy, and under the command of Captain Theodoros Koundouriotis (the Admiral's son), she carried the Greek government- in-exile from Cairo to liberated Athens. Averof continued as Fleet Headquarters until she was decommissioned in 1952. Afterward, the vessel remained anchored at Salamis until she was towed to Poros, where she was berthed from 1956 to 1983. Averof as a floating museum Georgios Averof with gangway in place for visitors in 2013 In 1984 the Navy decided to restore her as a museum ship, and in the same year she was towed to Palaio Faliro, where she is anchored as a functioning floating museum, seeking to promote the historical consolidation and upkeep of the Greek naval tradition. Free guided tours are provided to visiting schools and on holidays. In 2016 she has been retrofitted with an internal elevator allowing access to most decks by visitors with movement disabilities. She is berthed at Trocadero quay, as part of the Naval Tradition Park. The ship is crewed and regarded as in active service, carrying the Rear Admiral's rank flag a square blue flag with white cross, like the Greek jack, with two white stars in each of the two squares on the flagstaff sidehttp://www.pbase.com/drf/image/22944735 atop the mainmast with the masthead pennant (a long triangular blue flag with a white orthogonal Greek cross) displaced downward. Every Hellenic Navy ship entering or sailing in Faliro Bay honours Averof while passing. The crew are ordered to attention (with the \\"Still to\\" order) and from the relevant boatswain's pipe (or bugle call) every man on decks stands to attention, officers saluting, looking to the side where Averof is in sight until \\"Continue\\" is ordered.this link is an mp3 sound recording of the order in Greek \\"Still to port side\\", the boatswain's pipe call and the order \\"Continue\\"). In June 2010 the ship was involved in a scandal after being used as the stage for a lavish wedding party by Greek shipowner Leo Patitsas and TV persona Marietta Chrousala. The publication of photos from the party by the Proto Thema tabloid caused major political uproar, resulting in the dismissal of her commander, Commodore Evangelos Gavalas. On 26 April 2017, the Averof was towed from her museum dock at Palaio Faliro to the Skaramangas Shipyard, in Elefsis. Two commercial tugs and a pilot craft maneuvered the cruiser under the command of the Commodore Sotirios Charalampopoulos. A Greek Navy tug and a helicopter also assisted the operation. At the shipyard, the Averof underwent two months of maintenance and repairs, partially funded by Greek shipping magnate and philanthropist, Alexandros Goulandris. In May 2017, Goulandris, together with Hydra Ecologists Club, and several retired Hellenic Navy officers, announced their intention to begin a thorough review of the mechanical parts that would need to be newly machined or refurbished, so that the ship might eventually sail the Aegean under steam power. If realised, it would make the Averof the oldest operational steel warship in the world. Goulandris died on 25 May 2017, three weeks after the announcement. Averof sails again The cruiser's two months of dry dock inspection and hull maintenance were a prelude to the vessel's first voyage in 72 years. On 5 October 2017, the Averof left her long-time berth at Palaio Faliro, and was towed 250 miles across the open sea to a 50-day exhibition-docking on Thessaloniki's urban waterfront. The vessel was escorted by up to six large tugs and a pilot craft from Zouros Salvage & Towage. A Hellenic Navy tugboat also accompanied them. On 7 October, the group approached the Thessaloniki dock with horns and sirens blaring, their fire- fighting nozzles shooting great plumes of water skywards. An honor guard of Greek sailors and a Hellenic Navy band were arrayed along the dock to meet the ship. After 7 weeks of heavy visitation (over 130,000 visitors in 53 days) by the general public, the Averof returned to her Palaio Faliro museum dock on 13 December.

It stars Skeet Ulrich, Natasha Henstridge, Leslie Nielsen, and Rik Mayall and is about an Alaskan Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in which Kevin Manley, whose grandfather has passed on and now must participate in the state's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in order to prove he's worthy enough for his grandfather's estate. The film was released to DVD in the United States with the alternate title of Chilly Dogs on February 4, 2003. Plot Kevin Manley (Skeet Ulrich), a Los Angeles travel agent, receives the message that his grandpa has passed and left everything to him. However, he must go to Alaska in order to collect his inheritance. He leaves Canoga Park (Los Angeles), quits his job, despite his boss warning him that he will give up and decide to come back begging for his job back, and heads to Anchorage, Alaska. Upon arrival, Manley finds out that if he proves he is manly by participating in the yearly Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race he can obtain the land that his grandfather left to him and if he doesn't participate, the land wouldn't be signed over. While in Alaska, he meets some other participants including: the beautiful Bonnie Livengood (Natasha Henstridge), the stupid English Carter (Rik Mayall), ex- sheriff Ned Parker (Lochlyn Munro) and the local attorney Clive Thornton (Leslie Nielsen) who initially informed him of conditions of the race. Manley eventually discovers a box of various items that had belonged to his grandfather that included a fur cap and coat, a sword, and a diary which informed Manley that his grandfather had found gold on the land with a relative of a participant he had met earlier, Bonnie Livengood. While preparing for the event, two other participants, Clive and Carter, attempt to sabotage Manley's chances at winning the race so they can get the land and the gold. Clive promises to pay Carter a thousand dollars if he could prevent Kevin from entering or even finishing the race. Carter succeeds in stealing Kevin's team of huskies and burning down the shed containing his sled, tent, and supplies. Despite his losses, Kevin uses some of his remaining savings to buy a new sled, a tent, some winter clothing, and food supplies for him and his dogs. He also buys a new team of dogs to replace the ones he lost: Farty, a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Trooper, a German Shepherd, Pierre, a black poodle, Barker, a large dark-brown wiry-haired mongrel, Gumly, a large St. Bernard, Snowflake, a white American bulldog, and a Jack Russell terrier named Riddles. After the Iditarod race begins and the teams head off into the wilderness, Kevin begins to learn how to survive on the trail and face the perils that seem to pull on him. He and his dogs begin to form a bond of friendship. Along the trail, Kevin rescues Bonnie from Parker, who was in the process of trying to rape her, and gives him the \\"Canoga Park Coffee Zap\\", in which he pours hot coffee on his private area. Shortly afterwards, Bonnie and Kevin form a deep relationship and fall in love with each other. Clive and Carter, who are both anxious to have Kevin lose, try several plans to stop Kevin from finishing the race. Carter cuts half of one of the lines attached to the sled, in which it snaps free as the team rush on down the trail and Kevin has an accident, but is rescued by an Indian tribe and nursed back to health. Another night, Clive and Carter scatter strips of meat around the camp, which attracts a grizzly bear that tears down Kevin's tent and scares him and his dogs off. After the duo blow up Kevin's grandfather's cabin with dynamite, Kevin soon finds out of Clive's and Carter's plan and warn them both to stay away from him and his team. While camping in a snow cave during a blizzard, Bonnie and Kevin discover a map inside Kevin's jacket that belonged to his grandfather. The map tells them of a place known as Wolf Mountain, where Kevin believes that his grandfather hid his gold. When the storm clears, they reach Wolf Mountain and recovered the chest full of gold nuggets underneath the snow. Unfortunately, Clive and Carter arrive, take the chest of gold, and take Bonnie hostage after burying Kevin in the spot where they uncovered the gold. However, Kevin orders his lead dog, Farty to dig him out and he follows Clive and Bonnie all the way to Nome, which is the finish line of the Iditarod Sled Dog race. He manages to beat Parker and Carter, wins the race, and races onward to cut off Thornton's escape. He rescues Bonnie and Clive draws out a gun and fires at them, but he misses. The bullet glances off several metal objects inside an abandoned garage and finally hits an oil barrel, which blows up the garage with Clive inside it. At the same moment, the gold survives the explosion and falls around Bonnie and Kevin, who are surprised and overjoyed. Clive, who had recently survived the explosion, and Carter are arrested for their actions against Kevin and Bonnie, and Kevin is rewarded with the prize money of the race, a gold cup, and a bouquet of flowers, which he gives to Bonnie. He asks Bonnie to marry him and she happily agrees. With some of the prize money and his grandfather's gold, Bonnie and Kevin get married, build a new cabin, and settle down with their dogs and their first child, a baby girl.

Its first game premiered in Japan in 1987, and Final Fantasy games have subsequently been localized for markets in North America, Europe and Australia, on nearly every video game console since its debut on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Final Fantasy is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 97 million units worldwide to date. In addition to traditional role-playing games, the series includes tactical role-playing games, portable games, massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and games for mobile phones. Its popularity has placed it as the sixth-best-selling video game franchise, and the series has won multiple awards over the years. In addition to the 15 games released as part of the main (numbered) series and their many spin-offs and related titles, the Final Fantasy series has spawned many works in other media including anime, movies, novels and manga, and radio dramas. Final Fantasy: Unlimited, originally a stand-alone anime series, now has its own sub-franchise which includes video games. Many games, particularly the main series, have soundtrack album releases featuring their music in different arrangements. Square Enix has also consistently released companion books for its games which provide additional backstory and plot information, as well as detailed walkthroughs for the game. Since the announcement of Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Square Enix has focused on \\"polymorphic content\\", expanding each game world with material on many video game platforms, as well as other forms of media. Video games Each game in the main series takes place in a different fictional universe, although beginning with Final Fantasy X-2, additional video games set in the main series games' worlds have been released. Compilation of Final Fantasy VII and Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy are cross-platform multimedia projects consisting of games, films, books, and other media centered on their respective main series game, Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy XIII. Final Fantasy Tactics, although originally envisioned as a spin-off game, became its own series as part of Ivalice Alliance, which counts Final Fantasy XII in its membership. A large number of spin-off video games have also been made for the Final Fantasy series. These spin-off games vary in their relation to the main series; the first, The Final Fantasy Legend games, were marketed as related in North America but were considered to be the first three games of the SaGa series in their native Japan, and later SaGa games released outside Japan bear no Final Fantasy branding. Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series. Film and television Square's initial forays into film and television were critical and commercial failures. Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals was poorly received and the box office failure of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within lead to the merger between Square and Enix. The series did not have success in film until Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, which ultimately won several awards for \\"best anime feature\\" and sold over 2.4 million copies within a year. Radio drama Despite its decline in the United States, radio drama has remained popular in Japan. The series features a small number of radio drama releases. Soundtracks The primary composer of music for the main series was Nobuo Uematsu, who single-handedly composed the soundtracks for the first nine games, as well as directed the production of many of the albums. Music for the spin-off series and main series games beginning with Final Fantasy X was created by a variety of composers including Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta, Hitoshi Sakimoto, and Kumi Tanioka, as well as many others. In addition to the original soundtracks, listed below, many games have inspired orchestral, vocal, or piano arrangement albums, as well as compilation albums featuring music from several Final Fantasy games. Companion books Starting with Final Fantasy III, Square began publishing guide books for its games which traditionally include additional content such as developer interviews and expanded plot and setting information. Studio BentStuff wrote the first Ultimania book for Final Fantasy VIII in 1999, though the company had been contracted to write Final Fantasy VII True Script Dissection for the previous game. Since then, Ultimania books have been written for every major Final Fantasy title, including Battle Ultimania, Scenario Ultimania, and Ultimania Omega editions for some games. Square experimented with online content delivery with Final Fantasy IX Online Ultimania, but the move was criticized for forcing customers to buy a print guide while releasing most of the information online. Another online Ultimania was planned for Final Fantasy XI, but it was dropped during development. Square Enix has produced expanded editions to some books, such as Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania Revised Edition. In addition to the Ultimania series, Square Enix also publishes an Official Complete Guide series of guide books. A set of three artbooks have also been produced under the title The Sky: The Art of Final Fantasy. The set was first released in Japan in May 2002 by Digicube, then released in North America as a boxed set a decade later on October 17, 2012 by Dark Horse Books with additional postcards, prints, and booklets. A third edition was released in a slipcase by Dark Horse Books on July 17, 2013 without the additional pieces. Each book features concept art by Yoshitaka Amano, with the first book covering Final Fantasy I through III, the second IV through VI, and the third VII through X. Novels and manga Many Final Fantasy games have been adapted as novels and manga series. With the advent of the Internet, web novels and digital publishing have also become common. These stories act as companion pieces, offering an interpretation of the game's events or expanding the plot of the games by depicting additional scenarios.

In May 2006 the album was released and received a very warm reception. Larger magazines including Alternative Press, Metal Hammer, and Rock Sound started featuring the small-time Long Island band, creating a rise in popularity. Their slow rise to fame was also due to their non-stop touring. In 2006 and 2007, This Is Hell participated in the Sounds of the Underground tour which rivaled Ozzfest.

With this album, the band created a new more aggressive and raw sound not found on previous efforts. Only a few days after the release the band embarked on their first headlining tour, which included a full US tour followed by a small European tour. After the Euro tour, Chris Reynolds left the band to pursue his project Kill the Frontman and returned to life in upstate New York.

Its southern terminus is at U.S. Route 20 just south of Elmore, Ohio, and its northern terminus is at its interchange, along with State Route 184, at U.S. Route 23 in Sylvania, Ohio. Before an ODOT signage project in 2010, the northern (western) portion of the route, from its northern (western) terminus to the Maumee River was signed as an east-west route. The portion from the Maumee to its southern (eastern) terminus was signed north-south. ODOT has now signed all portions as north-south. Route description From its southern terminus, State Route 51 heads north to an interchange with the Ohio Turnpike before it enters Elmore. After exiting Elmore, the route heads northwest through the village of Genoa and near the town of Millbury before entering Northwood. The route from here to the Maumee River is also known as Woodville Road. The route interchanges with Interstate 280 before entering southwest Oregon and into Toledo. After it crosses the Maumee, it eventually moves onto Monroe Street, which moves in a generally northwesterly direction until it reaches U.S. Route 23 in Sylvania, where it ends. SR 184 and US 223 end here as well. History The original route of State Route 51 was that of current State Route 49 in western Ohio. The route was generally changed from 51 to 49 until the entire route became 49 in 1935. A new State Route 51 was certified in 1955, with its southern terminus where it is now and its northern terminus at then-State Route 120 (close to where I-280 is now) in Northwood. State Route 51 was extended to State Route 2 in Oregon in 1959. In 1989, State Route 51 replaced the route of U.S. Route 223 though Toledo and Sylvania across the Maumee River and on Monroe Street. U.S. Route 223 now officially ends at U.S. Route 23's interchange with State Routes 51 and 184 in Sylvania. State Route 51's interchange with the Ohio Turnpike was opened in 1997.

Description RGD-5 measurements Russian MUV booby trap firing device. A zero-delay pull fuze which is normally connected to a tripwire. The MUV fuze is fully compatible with the RGD-5. Fitting an MUV fuze makes it easier to conceal the grenade when setting a boobytrap e.g. partial burial.

RGD-5 data (in Russian) Typically, the RGD-5 uses the 3.2 to 4.2 second delay UZRG, UZRGM, or UZRGM-2 fuze, a universal Russian type that is also used in the RG-41, RG-42, and F1 grenades. The RGD-5 can be thrown about by the average male soldier and, when throwing, the grenade will make a loud \\"crack\\" sound as its spoon falls out activating the fuze, cooking off the grenade. This grenade is still manufactured in Russia with copies produced in Bulgaria, China (as the Type 59) and Georgia. Many millions of RGD-5s and its clones have been manufactured over the years and, although not as advanced as more modern grenades that are specifically designed to penetrate CRISAT standard body armour, the RGD-5 is still an effective and inexpensive weapon. A single RGD-5 grenade costs around $5 US, making it highly affordable during a major conflict when many grenades are sought.

When Bush began speaking, Arutyunian threw an RGD-5 hand grenade wrapped in a red plaid handkerchief toward the podium where Bush stood as he addressed the crowd. The grenade landed from the podium, near where Saakashvili, his wife Sandra E. Roelofs, Laura Bush, and other officials were seated. The grenade failed to detonate. Although original reports indicated that the grenade was not live, it was later revealed that it was. After Arutyunian pulled the pin and threw the grenade, it hit a girl, cushioning its impact. The red handkerchief remained wrapped around the grenade, and it prevented the striker lever from releasing. A Georgian security officer quickly removed the grenade, and Arutyunian disappeared.

High school Patulski was a star athlete at Christian Brothers Academy in Syracuse, New York, where he was a three-year letterman in football, basketball, and track and field. In his senior season in 1967, the 6-foot-5 fullback scored 140 points and led the Brothers to a 7–1 record. He was All-City in football and basketball. A High School All-American, he received over 60 scholarship offers to play football.Syracuse Hall Of Fame.com In 1991, Patulski was voted to the Greater Syracuse Sports Hall of Fame for his activities as a high school athlete.ibid College career At the University of Notre Dame, Patulski was converted into a defensive end. He was an All-American in 1971, and he won the 1971 Lombardi Award, which is given to college football's best lineman. A Fighting Irish captain, he finished ninth in that year's Heisman Trophy balloting. Selected the Nation's Lineman of the Year by UPI and Gridiron Magazine in 1971. Patulski was named to Football News sophomore All-America squad in 1969 and was an honorable mention All-American in 1970.University of Notre Dame website Started every game in his collegiate career, and totaled 186 tackles, 40 for losses; broke up 10 passes; recovered five fumbles and returned one blocked punt 12 yards. In his final football season at Notre Dame, 1971, he was the team defensive MVP. Patulski made 74 tackles, 22 more than his total for the 1970 season. Seventeen of those stops resulted losses for the opposing team. Patulski also broke up six passes, recovered one fumble.ibid The 1969-1971 Irish rushing defenses and total defenses were ranked in the nation's top six all three years and its scoring defense was in the top ten in 1970 and 1971 and compiled a record of 25–4–1 over those three seasons while Patulski was a starter.Notre Dame Media Guide He was awarded the game ball for his performance in the Irish initial 1971 contest against Northwestern and was acclaimed as national lineman of the week following the North Carolina game. His play versus Michigan State prompted the head coach Duffy Dougherty to hail him as Notre Dame's \\"finest defender\\". Patulski was later named to Notre Dame's All-Century team. He played in the 1971 Cotton Bowl Classic and the Hula Bowl. In the Hula Bowl he won the Defensive Lineman of the Game award. In the summer of 1972, Patulski played in the College All-Star game, in Chicago, IL.Walt Patulski bio Patulski was lauded by one team as \\"(T)he best we've seen for many years.\\" All but unstoppable on the pass rush, he dazzled the experts with his \\"amazing agility and lateral mobility.\\"Time magazine website Professional career Patulski was drafted by the Buffalo Bills with the first overall pick of the 1972 NFL Draft. He was the last Notre Dame player to be drafted #1 overall. His size and speed were among the reasons he was highly touted: At 6'6\\" and 250 pounds, he could run the 40 in 4.9 seconds. As a rookie, Patulski led the Bills with five sacks. In 1973 the Bills improved to a 9-5 record after going 4-9-1 in his rookie season of 1972, he recorded seven sacks, which was second on the team and was voted AP NFL Defensive Player of the Week November 28, 1973, after Week 11. In 1974, the Bills recorded another 9-5 record and made the playoffs for the first time in eight years as he recorded 5.5 sacks. The Bills were 8-6 during his third season, but did not advance to the AFC playoffs. He recorded four sacks, a career low, however, two came in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals offensive line, who gave up only eight sacks in 1975. He lined up against St. Louis all-pro and Pro Football Hall of Fame offensive tackle Dan Dierdorf. Patulski played four years (1972–1975) with the Bills, and then he was traded to the Cardinals for a second-round draft pick, and played one year with the St. Louis Cardinals (1977). He then suffered career-ending knee injury. The Bills considered Patulski expendable when they acquired Sherman White from the Cincinnati Bengals, who was selected second overall in the 1972 draft out of California. Patulski's career was considered unsuccessful. In fact, ESPN ranked him as the 27th biggest draft bust of all-time on April 18, 2008.ESPN.com Personal Walt is a recipient of the Key to Syracuse (New York) for his distinguished community service.

The name itself derives from eponymous plant's unusual growth pattern; against a wall as a stake or in cracks and gaps in stone walls. \\"Wallflowers\\" might literally stand against a wall and simply observe others at a social gathering, rather than mingle. This could be due to anxiety, shyness, lack of social skills or self-esteem. Wallflower can also be used on a grander scale. When a company or organization chooses or is forced to remain on the sidelines of any activity, they can be referred to as a \\"wallflower\\". Connection to sociology =Structural function theory= Structural functionalism is a sociological theory that sees society as a number of complex parts that form a stable and functional whole. This leads to a strong and coherent family unit made of smaller parts, with the functioning family unit then going on to form the smaller parts of a wider community, society and so on. =Social conflict theory= Social conflict theory in sociology claims that society is in a state of perpetual conflict due to competition for limited resources. It holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than consensus and conformity. According to conflict theory, those with wealth and power try to hold on to it by any means possible, chiefly by suppressing the poor and powerless. =Symbolic interaction theory= The most relevant sociological theory that the \\"wallflower\\" relates to, Symbolic Interaction describes specific gestures or social norms that are symbolic in meaning. The theory consists of three core principles: meaning, language and thought. These core principles lead to conclusions about the creation of a person’s self and socialization into a larger community. Because the \\"wallflower\\" will usually exhibit a lack of interaction with others, it becomes symbolic of their thoughts and feelings towards others. The most specific example would be in the body language. Many times people who are shy have little or no eye contact with others. You may see a man, woman, or child try to avoid eye contact with others while out walking around in public or even in private. For some this may be a condition that becomes consistent over time and become a normal action. In the case of parties or social gatherings, the \\"wallflower\\" will remain at a certain distance from the crowd or most of the people. When a shy person is around others you may see that they do what they can to stay away from the people that they do not know. Even with some friends you may or may not see the shy man or woman even near or in the Bell Bubble or within the intimate distance of friends. In a social setting you may not see a shy person in the center of the room without a friend or group of friends. Shy people tend to stay out of the possibility of even being the center of attention. =Social anxiety= Social anxiety the extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations: Social anxiety disorder can wreak havoc on the lives of those who suffer from it. Symptoms may be so extreme that they disrupt daily life. People with this disorder, also called social phobia, may have few or no social or romantic relationships, making them feel powerless, alone, or even ashamed. Although they recognize that the fear is excessive and unreasonable, people with social anxiety disorder feel powerless against their anxiety. They are terrified they will humiliate or embarrass themselves. The anxiety can interfere significantly with daily routines, occupational performance, or social life, making it difficult to complete school, interview and get a job, and have friendships and romantic relationships. Being a wallflower can be considered a less-intense form of social anxiety. A person with social anxiety may feel a sense of hesitation in large crowds, and may even have a sense of panic if forced to become the center of attention. This fear may cause them to do something as minor as stand away from the center of a party, but it may also cause a major or minor anxiety attack. People with social anxiety disorder do not believe that their anxiety is related to a mental or physical illness. This type of anxiety occurs in most social situations, especially when the person feels on display or is the center of attention. Once a person avoids almost all social and public interactions, it can be said that the person has an extreme case of social anxiety disorder, more commonly called Avoidant Personality Disorder. People with social anxiety disorder have an elevated rate of relationship difficulties and substance abuse. =Panic and anxiety attacks= Anxiety attacks are a combination of physical and mental symptoms that are intense and overwhelming. The anxiety is, however, more than just regular nervousness. Symptoms of anxiety attacks and panic attacks mimic serious medical issues, such as: * Heart attacks and heart failure. * Brain tumors. * Multiple sclerosis. Despite their intensity, anxiety attacks are generally not life-threatening. In popular culture * In the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Scott sees Ramona standing by herself at a party. Because she is separate from the crowd and not interacting with anyone, she could be considered a wallflower.\\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\".

Before working at Square Enix, he was employed at Konami. He was also an arranger and a keyboardist in the band The Black Mages. Additionally, Fukui arranged Angela Aki's \\"Kiss Me Good-Bye\\" from Final Fantasy XII. In October 2007, he left Square Enix to become a lecturer, although he continued to work with The Black Mages until the band dissolved in 2010, and continued to do freelance work with video games. His Konami Kukeiha Club nickname was \\"Funiki Fukui\\". He lives in Yokohama, Japan. Biography Fukui was born on March 4, 1960, in Hyōgo Prefecture. He joined the video game company Konami in 1991. While there, he contributed to the soundtracks of Lethal Enforcers, G.I. Joe and Violent Storm. He was also one of the keyboardists for the Kukeiha Club, and played in the live event at the Budokan in Tokyo. In 1995, he moved to Osaka to join \\"Solid\\", a subsidiary of Square (now Square Enix). He was later transferred to Square's main office in Tokyo. While there, he wrote music for games such as Einhänder, Front Mission 5: Scars of the War, and Project Sylpheed, and did arrangements for Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and Hanjuku Hero 4: 7-Jin no Hanjuku Hero. He played the keyboard and organ for 2005's Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song, the first game he worked on for which he neither composed nor arranged the music. In 2000, Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito formed an experimental partnership to compose music for the video game All Star Pro-Wrestling in a rock style. After the game's success, the two continued to compose in the same style. In 2002, Fukui and Sekito decided to arrange some of the compositions of Nobuo Uematsu, the primary composer for the music of the Final Fantasy series. Uematsu, a fan of rock music, enjoyed these arrangements, and Fukui and Sekito asked him to join them in making a rock band. Declining at first due to feeling too busy with his composing duties and attempts to become a music producer with his Smile Please label, Uematsu agreed to join them in a single live performance as a keyboardist, and afterwards decided to join the two in making The Black Mages; Fukui and Sekito had refused to start one if Uematsu was not involved as one of the musicians. The band went on to produce three albums before dissolving in 2010; while some of the members went on to form the Earthbound Papas, Fukui was not one of them. In 2007, Fukui was appointed at the HAL College of Tokyo (which opened in spring 2009), to teach classes relating to music composition and performance.

The final flight destination was San Francisco, California, with stops in Chicago, Denver and Salt Lake City. The aircraft operating the service, a Douglas DC-4 propliner, registration crashed into Medicine Bow Peak, near Laramie, Wyoming, killing all 66 people on board (63 passengers, 3 crew members). The victims included five female members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and military personnel. At the time, this was the deadliest airline crash in the history of American commercial aviation. Another 66 lives had been lost earlier that year in the March 22 crash in Hawaii of a United States Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster military transport aircraft,Aviation Safety Network Aircraft Accident Douglas R6D-1 (DC-6) 131612 Honolulu, HI and 66 had also died in the mid-air collision of two United States Air Force C-119G Flying Boxcars over West Germany on August 11, placing the three crashes in a three-way tie as the deadliest aviation incidents in 1955.Aviation Safety Network: Accident DescriptionAviation Safety Network: Accident Description  Timeline  Flight 409 left New York, New York one hour and 11 minutes late. Routine crew changes were made in Chicago and Denver. Flight 409 departed Denver, Colorado at 6:33 a.m. on October 6, 1955, 83 minutes after its scheduled departure time. The assigned path the airliner was expected to fly was along airways V-4 Denver to Laramie, Wyoming V-118 to Rock River, Wyoming radio, V-6 to Fort Bridger, Wyoming, and V-32 to a landing in Salt Lake City. The flight was operating under Visual Flight Rules and was assigned a cruising altitude of 10,000 feet. Because the aircraft was not pressurized, the altitude was chosen to keep the passengers and crew from experiencing the discomfort that flying higher could cause. The route assigned to the airliner was specifically designed to allow safe passage at 10,000 feet over the continental divide in the Rocky Mountains. (a text version is also available) (if links above fail to load report, visit http://dotlibrary.specialcollection.net and select \\"Historical Aircraft Accident Reports (1934-1965)\\", then retry report links) An expected position report from the United crew, scheduled for 8:11 a.m. while over Rock Springs, was not received, and repeated attempts to make radio contact with flight 409 were met with no response. With the airliner's status unknown, the Civil Aeronautics Authority was alerted to the missing aircraft. No radar was in place for civil aviation in this region in 1955. With no radar traces, manual searches were required to find the aircraft. Search effort The Wyoming Air National Guard launched two search aircraft: a two-seat T-33 Shooting Star piloted by Mel Conine and a single seat F-80 Shooting Star piloted by Ed Weed. Working on the assumption that the United plane may have taken an unauthorized short cut to make up for the 83-minute delay out of Denver, the two search planes pointed their aircraft toward the highest mountains in the region, Elk Mountain and Medicine Bow Peak. After a search of Elk Mountain failed to find the missing DC-4, Conine and his observer spotted at 11:40 a.m. a black stain and wreckage just southwest of the highest portion of Medicine Bow Peak. Turbulence kept them too far away to locate any possible survivors and they left the site to return to their base in Cheyenne. \\\\- extensive coverage and photographs The New York Times (Oct. 7, 1955) reported: > \\"First rescuers to reach the scene said they had found about 50 bodies > strewn along a 300-foot course down the face of the mountain. Only a tail > piece, part of the fuselage and a wing of the plane had been located at mid- > afternoon by rescuers who fought snowdrifts and a howling wind on the > 12,005-foot Medicine Bow Peak.

Recovery Recovery of the widely scattered remains of the victims was extremely challenging due to the difficult terrain at the crash site. At the base of the almost perpendicular cliff where the aircraft hit, movement was hindered by a wide talus of weathered, fragmented rock and large boulders, all piled loosely on a steep slope. Mountaineers doing the recovery work also had to be constantly wary of rock falls that might be triggered by the activities of those above them on the cliff face. Cold weather and occasional snow also played a role in impeding recovery efforts. The recovery of human remains was not completed until the evening of October 11, 1955, five full days after the accident. Investigation Due to safety concerns, the CAB accident investigation team —not trained in alpine mountaineering techniques— was unable to visit the cliff location where the DC-4 initially hit. Study of the wreckage that could be retrieved for examination suggested a nose up attitude and an unusually low airspeed of the plane, implying that the plane was attempting a climb at the time of its crash. The reasons for this are not explicitly known, but several theories exist: * An altimeter indicating an inaccurate altitude, leading the pilot to believe he was lower than he actually was; * Mountain obscuration by clouds, preventing visual sighting of the mountain peak before it was too late to react to prevent the crash; * Turbulence, specifically downdrafts, around Medicine Bow peak, pushing Flight 409 into the mountain. Possible incapacitation of crew by carbon monoxide emanating from a faulty cabin heater was speculated upon based on recovery crew observations that crew bodies appeared 'discolored.' This theory was never proven, and the CAB report specifically states that there was no evidence to support crew incapacitation. After the investigation of the accessible wreckage was completed, United Airlines requested that the remaining debris be destroyed by the military. Attempts were made to accomplish this, but despite the use of explosives, artillery fire and —according to most sources— napalm bombs dropped from aircraft, complete obliteration of the wreckage was not possible. One source, a 2007 book about the Rocky Mountain Rescue Group, contradicts the assertion that military jets bombed the site with napalm; instead, the book states that the cliff face was mined with explosives that were detonated in the spring of 1956, and the event was tightly controlled and not publicized. Regardless of the disposal method, small fragments of flight 409's airframe and parts of the engines still exist in the area surrounding the crash site. \\\\- extensive coverage from multiple sources Legacy Prior to the loss of United 409, the deadliest scheduled airline accident in U.S. history was the June 1950 disappearance of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2501 over Lake Michigan, when 58 died. The 66 lives lost on Medicine Bow Peak remained the highest death toll on a scheduled airline flight in the U.S. for less than a year. In June 1956 two airliners, a Super Constellation and a DC-7, collided over the Grand Canyon, killing 128 people. Flight 409's crash, and other crashes and mid-air collisions in the United States that occurred over the next several years, convinced the U.S. Congress to improve airline safety procedures, and to increase civil aviation radar coverage. On August 25, 2001, a privately funded bronze memorial plaque was dedicated in the Miner's Camp turnout (), along Wyoming Highway 130 (Snowy Range Road). The plaque faces the mountain where the crash occurred. The plaque reads, \\"In memory of the 66 passengers and crew that perished on Medicine Bow Peak October 6, 1955\\".

Officers of the Bavarian Bereitschaftspolizei (wearing the Bavarian uniform) Hundertschaft of the Saxony Bereitschaftspolizei (old green vans) The Bereitschaftspolizei (literally \\"Readiness Police/On-Call Police (Reserve)\\", effectively Anti-Riot Police) are the support and rapid reaction units of Germany's police forces. They are composed of detachments from the Federal Police and the State Police forces of Germany. Federal Republic The Federal Ministry of the Interior maintains an office of the Bereitschaftspolizei in Berlin which monitors and coordinates the deployment of all Bereitschaftspolizei units in Germany. The ministry also provides standardized weapons, vehicles and other equipment. =Federal Police= The Bundespolizei maintains 10 rapid reaction battalions (called Bundespolizeiabteilung or BPA) stationed around the country in Ratzeburg, Uelzen, Blumberg, Bad Düben, Duderstadt, Sankt Augustin, Hünfeld, Bayreuth, Bad Bergzabern and Deggendorf. These units can reinforce the federal police in any sphere of its missions and support the police forces of the Länder. They are also trained to assist local authorities in case of disasters and uprisings. Under new interior ministry plans, the number of Bereitschaftspolizei companies will increase from 28 to 29 comprising approx. 25 percent of Germany’s police support units. Official BPOL news release on reorganisation (in German) =Länder/State Police= Sonderwagen 4 police armoured car The state Bereitschaftspolizei units are part of the Landespolizei (state police) and are available for crowd control, (large) demonstrations, sport events and to assist the Schutzpolizei when needed. Aside from their primary functions, in some states they also train police recruits who serve about three years in combined training and service in these police support units. The units of one federal state can be deployed to assist the police of another state in case of riots, civil disturbances as well as catastrophes. Their day-to-day duties vary by locality. In Hamburg they patrol the subway system (alongside the security service), assist in raids (f.i. in the red-light district or organised crime), perform traffic control duty and support regular police officers on patrols. Some states (e.g. the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg) have a hybrid system, where units of the Schutzpolizei may act as units of the Bereitschaftspolizei (f.i. for sudden or large riots or terror attacks) - they form so-called Alarm-Hundertschaften with units from all Hamburg police stations (to ensure the performance of the regular tasks of the stations in the same time) to respond as fast as possible. =Structure= The structure, equipment and training of Bepo units is standard so that units from different parts of Germany can operate together without any problems. The Bereitschaftspolizei is assigned to barracks and organized into sections, platoons and 120 to 150 person training or rapid reaction companies called Hundertschaften. In most Länder, the Bereitschaftspolizei contingents are formed into 600 - 800 person battalions, but in the six largest Länder they are organized into regiments. Some police forces like Hamburg have additional alert platoons that are part of the state police and manned by regular police officers in case of urgent need when support from the state or the Federal Police is not available. The units are equipped with their own transport and rations allowing them to be deployed quickly to other Länder without having to rely on outside support. They are equipped with a wide varirty of specialised vehicles such as armoured cars, buses, water cannons, earth moving equipment and command and control vehicles. Arrest units give the Bepos special capabilities to secure evidence and arrest perpetrators at events where large crowds normally impede police operations. In the former German Democratic Republic See article: Volkspolizei- Bereitschaft Volkspolizei-Bereitschaft from Basdorf on duty at the Brandenburg Gate before the fall of the Berlin Wall The East German Ministry of the Interior maintained the independent Department of the Alert Units of the Volkspolizei known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). It consisted of between 12,000 and 15,000 men (sources disagree) in 21 Volkspolizei Alert Units of battalion strength. There was usually one unit per district of East Germany but the key districts of Halle, Leipzig and Magdeburg, with their large working class populations, and Potsdam all had two units. The Presidium of the People's Police in East Berlin had three units located in Basdorf. Each Alert unit was organized as follows: *Headquarters section *Four alert companies: **One mechanized company in wheeled armored personnel carriers **Three motorized companies in trucks *Support company **Anti-tank platoon with 3x45 mm/57 mm(later ATGM's) **Artillery platoon with 3x76.2 mm ZiS-3 field/anti-tank guns **Mortar platoon with 3x82 mm mortars *Headquarters and staff company with: **signals platoon **engineer platoon **chemical platoon **reconnaissance platoon **transport platoon **supply platoon **control section **medical section These units were equipped with light and medium infantry weapons, SK-1 wheeled armoured personnel carriers, SK-2 water cannon (both armoured and unarmoured versions) and buses. Their uniform was the standard Volkspolizei grey-green. The political reliability of the Alert Units was of particular importance to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) as they would be used against the population in the event of social disorders such as the strike of 17 June 1953 in the industrial areas of East Germany.

He trained as a topographical draughtsman, wrote and illustrated many books early in his career, before concentrating on his architectural practice. Life Crathes Castle, an illustration from Billings' Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland Billings was born in the Bayswater area of London in 1812. At the age of thirteen he was apprenticed to the topographical draughtsman John Britton for seven years. In 1837 he illustrated George Godwin's History and Description of St. Paul's Cathedral, and two years later, with Frederick Mackenzie, the two volumes of Godwin's Churches of London. He assisted Sir Jeffry Wyattville on drawings of Windsor Castle, and prepared many views of the ruins of the old Houses of Parliament after the fire. The works he undertook on his own account included Illustrations of the Temple Church, London, (1838); Gothic Panelling in Brancepeth Church, Durham (1841) and Kettering Church, Northamptonshire (1843). He produced important works on Carlisle Cathedral and Durham Cathedral, published in 1840 and 1843, and Illustrations of the Architectural Antiquities of the County of Durham (1846). The work for which he became best known was The Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of Scotland, published in four volumes between 1845 and 1852, which contained 240 illustrations, with explanatory text. The work was a great success and was reprinted several times, in 1899, 1900, 1901, 1908, 1909, 2008, 2012, 2015, 2016 and 2017. In the 1901 edition it was revealed that all the commentaries were written by John Hill Burton, the edition included a foreword by Robert Rowand Anderson. Anderson wrote in the foreword of it being \\"in the front rank of Architectural publications, and from this position it has yet to be displaced.\\" His other published works were An Attempt to define the Geometric Proportions of Gothic Architecture, as illustrated by the Cathedrals of Carlisle and Worcester (1840) Illustrations of Geometric Tracery, from the panelling belonging to Carlisle Cathedral 1842 ; The Infinity of Geometric Design exemplified (1849) and The Power of Form applied to Geometric Tracery (1851). The Attempt to Define the Geometric Proportions of Gothic Architecture has been the subject of scholarly interpretation. Gentlemans Magazine (1840) A reviewer in The Art Journal explained that Billings had deduced that the architect of Carlisle Cathedral: > had been guided by the repetition of a circle whose diameter was the extreme > width of the building; that the distribution and even the substance of the > columns were settled by some subdivision of the same circle; and lastly, > that a circle regulated by the width of the compartments thus formed, was > the basis upon which the heights of the various portions of the building > were framed. Eventually he gave up authorship, and devoted himself entirely to his architectural practice. He was employed on the restoration of the chapel of Edinburgh Castle (a government commission); the Douglas Room in Stirling Castle; Gosford House, Haddingtonshire, for the Earl of Wemyss; the restoration of Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire; Crosby-on-Eden Church, Cumberland and Kemble House and Vicarage, Wiltshire. In 1865 Billings erected an unusual memorial to fellow architect Peter Nicholson (1765–1844) in Carlisle cemetery, in the form of a pair of interpenetrating obelisks. From 1865 Billings lived at Putney, where he purchased the Moulinère, a house once occupied by the Duchess of Marlborough. He died there 14 November 1874.

It phosphorylates several key proteins that initiate activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis. Several of these targets, including p53, CHK2, BRCA1, NBS1 and H2AX are tumor suppressors. In 1995, the gene was discovered by Dr. Yosef Shiloh who named its product ATM since he found that its mutations are responsible for the disorder ataxia–telangiectasia. In 1998, the Shiloh and Kastan laboratories independently showed that ATM is a protein kinase whose activity is enhanced by DNA damage.  Introduction  Throughout the cell cycle DNA is monitored for damage. Damages result from errors during replication, by-products of metabolism, general toxic drugs or ionizing radiation. The cell cycle has different DNA damage checkpoints, which inhibit the next or maintain the current cell cycle step. There are two main checkpoints, the G1/S and the G2/M, during the cell cycle, which preserve correct progression. ATM plays a role in cell cycle delay after DNA damage, especially after double-strand breaks (DSBs). ATM is recruited to sites of double strand breaks by DSB sensor proteins, such as the MRN complex. After being recruited, it phosphorylates NBS1, along other DSB repair proteins. These modified mediator proteins then amplify the DNA damage signal, and transduce the signals to downstream effectors such as CHK2 and p53.  Structure  The ATM gene codes for a 350 kDa protein consisting of 3056 amino acids. ATM belongs to the superfamily of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs). The PIKK superfamily comprises six Ser/Thr-protein kinases that show a sequence similarity to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks). This protein kinase family includes ATR (ATM- and RAD3-related), DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Characteristic for ATM are five domains. These are from N-terminus to C-terminus the HEAT repeat domain, the FRAP-ATM-TRRAP (FAT) domain, the kinase domain (KD), the PIKK-regulatory domain (PRD) and the FAT-C-terminal (FATC) domain. The HEAT repeats directly bind to the C-terminus of NBS1. The FAT domain interacts with ATM's kinase domain to stabilize the C-terminus region of ATM itself. The KD domain resumes kinase activity, while the PRD and the FATC domain regulate it. Although no structure for ATM has been solved, the overall shape of ATM is very similar to DNA-PKcs and is composed of a head and a long arm that is thought to wrap around double-stranded DNA after a conformational change. The entire N-terminal domain together with the FAT domain are predicted to adopt an α-helical structure, which was found by sequence analysis. This α-helical structure is believed to form a tertiary structure, which has a curved, tubular shape present for example in the Huntingtin protein, which also contains HEAT repeats. FATC is the C-terminal domain with a length of about 30 amino acids. It is highly conserved and consists of an α-helix followed by a sharp turn, which is stabilized by a disulfide bond. Schematic illustration of the four known conserved domains in four members of the PIKKs family  Function  A complex of the three proteins MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1 (XRS2 in yeast), called the MRN complex in humans, recruits ATM to double strand breaks (DSBs) and holds the two ends together. ATM directly interacts with the NBS1 subunit and phosphorylates the histone variant H2AX on Ser139. This phosphorylation generates binding sites for adaptor proteins with a BRCT domain. These adaptor proteins then recruit different factors including the effector protein kinase CHK2 and the tumor suppressor p53. The ATM-mediated DNA damage response consists of a rapid and a delayed response. The effector kinase CHK2 is phosphorylated and thereby activated by ATM. Activated CHK2 phosphorylates phosphatase CDC25A, which is degraded thereupon and can no longer dephosphorylate CDK1-cyclin B, resulting in cell-cycle arrest. If the DSB can not be repaired during this rapid response, ATM additionally phosphorylates MDM2 and p53 at Ser15. p53 is also phosphorylated by the effector kinase CHK2. These phosphorylation events lead to stabilization and activation of p53 and subsequent transcription of numerous p53 target genes including CDK inhibitor p21 which lead to long-term cell-cycle arrest or even apoptosis. ATM-mediated two-step response to DNA double strand breaks. In the rapid response activated ATM phosphorylates effector kinase CHK2 which phosphorylates CDC25A, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, phosphorylated CDK2-Cyclin accumulates and progression through the cell cycle is blocked. In the delayed response ATM phosphorylates the inhibitor of p53, MDM2, and p53, which is also phosphorylated by Chk2. The resulting activation and stabilization of p53 leads to an increased expression of Cdk inhibitor p21, which further helps to keep Cdk activity low and to maintain long-term cell cycle arrest. The protein kinase ATM may also be involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, as a regulator of mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) whereby old, dysfunctional mitochondria are removed. Increased ATM activity also occurs in viral infection where ATM is activated early during dengue virus infection as part of autophagy induction and ER stress response.  Regulation  A functional MRN complex is required for ATM activation after DSBs. The complex functions upstream of ATM in mammalian cells and induces conformational changes that facilitate an increase in the affinity of ATM towards its substrates, such as CHK2 and p53. Inactive ATM is present in the cells without DSBs as dimers or multimers. Upon DNA damage, ATM autophosphorylates on residue Ser1981. This phosphorylation provokes dissociation of ATM dimers, which is followed by the release of active ATM monomers. Further autophosphorylation (of residues Ser367 and Ser1893) is required for normal activity of the ATM kinase. Activation of ATM by the MRN complex is preceded by at least two steps, i.e. recruitment of ATM to DSB ends by the mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) which binds to MRE11, and the subsequent stimulation of kinase activity with the NBS1 C-terminus. The three domains FAT, PRD and FATC are all involved in regulating the activity of the KD kinase domain. The FAT domain interacts with ATM's KD domain to stabilize the C-terminus region of ATM itself. The FATC domain is critical for kinase activity and highly sensitive to mutagenesis. It mediates protein-protein interaction for example with the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 (HIV-1 Tat interacting protein 60 kDa), which acetylates ATM on residue Lys3016. The acetylation occurs in the C-terminal half of the PRD domain and is required for ATM kinase activation and for its conversion into monomers. While deletion of the entire PRD domain abolishes the kinase activity of ATM, specific small deletions show no effect.  Role in cancer  Ataxia–telangiectasia (AT) is a rare human disease characterized by cerebellar degeneration, extreme cellular sensitivity to radiation and a predisposition to cancer. All AT patients contain mutations in the ATM gene. Most other AT- like disorders are defective in genes encoding the MRN protein complex. One feature of the ATM protein is its rapid increase in kinase activity immediately following double-strand break formation. The phenotypic manifestation of AT is due to the broad range of substrates for the ATM kinase, involving DNA repair, apoptosis, G1/S, intra-S checkpoint and G2/M checkpoints, gene regulation, translation initiation, and telomere maintenance. Therefore, a defect in ATM has severe consequences in repairing certain types of damage to DNA, and cancer may result from improper repair. AT patients have an increased risk for breast cancer that has been ascribed to ATM's interaction and phosphorylation of BRCA1 and its associated proteins following DNA damage. Certain kinds of leukemias and lymphomas, including mantle cell lymphoma, T-ALL, atypical B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and T-PLL are also associated with ATM defects. ATM mutation frequencies in sporadic cancers Mutations in the ATM gene are found at relatively low frequencies in sporadic cancers. According to COSMIC, the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer, the frequencies with which heterozygous mutations in ATM are found in common cancers include 0.7% in 713 ovarian cancers, 0.9% in central nervous system cancers, 1.9% in 1,120 breast cancers, 2.1% in 847 kidney cancers, 4.6% in colon cancers, 7.2% among 1,040 lung cancers and 11.1% in 1790 hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue cancers. A comprehensive literature search on ATM deficiency in pancreatic cancer, that captured 5,234 patients, estimated that the total prevalence of germline or somatic ATM mutations in pancreatic cancer was 6.4%. ATM mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers of response for certain therapies, since preclinical studies have found that ATM deficiency can sensitise some cancer types to ATR inhibition. Frequent epigenetic deficiencies of ATM in cancers ATM is one of the DNA repair genes frequently hypermethylated in its promoter region in various cancers (see table of such genes in Cancer epigenetics). The promoter methylation of ATM causes reduced protein or mRNA expression of ATM. More than 73% of brain tumors were found to be methylated in the ATM gene promoter and there was strong inverse correlation between ATM promoter methylation and its protein expression (p < 0.001). The ATM gene promoter was observed to be hypermethylated in 53% of small (impalpable) breast cancers and was hypermethylated in 78% of stage II or greater breast cancers with a highly significant correlation (P = 0.0006) between reduced ATM mRNA abundance and aberrant methylation of the ATM gene promoter. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the ATM promoter methylation status of paired tumors and surrounding histologically uninvolved lung tissue was found to be 69% and 59%, respectively. However, in more advanced NSCLC the frequency of ATM promoter methylation was lower at 22%. The finding of ATM promoter methylation in surrounding histologically uninvolved lung tissue suggests that ATM deficiency may be present early in a field defect leading to progression to NSCLC. In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, 42% of tumors displayed ATM promoter methylation. DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer, and deficiencies in DNA repair likely underlie many forms of cancer. If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage may increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error- prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage may also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations may give rise to cancer. The frequent epigenetic deficiency of ATM in a number of cancers likely contributed to the progression of those cancers. Meiosis ATM functions during meiotic prophase. The wild-type ATM gene is expressed at a four-fold increased level in human testes compared to somatic cells (such as skin fibroblasts). In both mice and humans, ATM deficiency results in female and male infertility. Deficient ATM expression causes severe meiotic disruption during prophase I. In addition, impaired ATM-mediated DNA DSB repair has been identified as a likely cause of aging of mouse and human oocytes. Expression of the ATM gene, as well as other key DSB repair genes, declines with age in mouse and human oocytes and this decline is paralleled by an increase of DSBs in primordial follicles. These findings indicate that ATM- mediated homologous recombinational repair is a crucial function of meiosis.

KSHE transmits on 94.7 MHz and currently uses the slogan \\"KSHE 95, Real Rock Radio\\". Owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, the station's studios are located in Creve Coeur, while the transmitter is located in Shrewsbury. KSHE recently announced its first HD Radio subchannel, which will broadcast a 24-hour version of longtime personality John Ulett's \\"KSHE Klassics\\" show. History After working as an engineer for 20 years with the Pulitzer stations, KSD and KSD-TV, Ed Ceries invested his life savings and his considerable engineering efforts in building his own FM station, which he called KSHE. He literally built some of the equipment himself, and on February 11, 1961, the station signed on from the basement of the Ceries' home in suburban Crestwood. The station called itself \\"The Lady of FM,\\" and had a classical music format. For a while, all the announcers were women. Most of the basement was used for the station operations, with the Associated Press Teletype installed next to the clothes washer. The record library room doubled as an administrative office where Mrs. Ceries also did her ironing. Listener loyalty was strong, and at times they would come to the station with copies of classical selections they thought were better than the ones being played on KSHE. Unfortunately, advertisers were not convinced FM radio—particularly classical music on FM radio—had much of an audience. After the first year, the format was adjusted to contain about 90% middle-of-the-road music and 10% classical, with nine daily news broadcasts. In 1964, the station was sold to Century Broadcasting. New general manager Howard Grafman was convinced by his friend Ron Elz to adopt a new format that Elz had heard on a trip to San Francisco on KMPX: album-oriented rock, with high latitude given to individual DJs as to what to play. During the 1970s and early 1980s, KSHE was influential in the growth of many midwestern bands such as Styx, Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon and Head East.Head East KSHE had a wide and varied play list, which popularized such rock artists as Lake from Germany, Stingray from South Africa, and rising bands from Australia and New Zealand like Midnight Oil and Split Enz, as well as playing the classics from the more well-known rock legends. The very first rock song played on KSHE in November 1967 that ushered in their format change ,was Jefferson Airplane's \\"White Rabbit\\".http://www.stlmediahistory.com/index.php/Radio/RadioArticles/kshe- imports-a-format-from-the-west KSHE sometimes played music nonstop for hours without station identification, which eventually was brought to the attention of the FCC and warnings from the agency to identify as required. In late 1967, '68 and most of '69 they would play whole albums in the late afternoon and late at night any day of the week. Albums played in their entirety included such titles as The Firesign Theatre's Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him, The Who's Tommy, Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band's Gorilla Gorilla (Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band album), Arlo Guthrie's Alice's Restaurant, and Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, just to name a few. KSHE would frequently play concept albums in their entirety, as well as entire album sides from favorites such as Rush. Sunday evenings were dedicated to playing seven albums from seven different artists on a show called the Seventh Day starting in the late 1970s, a program that continues to this day. The albums usually were played from 7:00 pm until after midnight. The Seventh Day concept was later used by other stations around the country. Instead of the broadcast convention of reading news ripped from the Associated Press or United Press International wire machine (\\"rip and read\\"), early KSHE newscasts introduced news topics by preceding the story with rock music excerpts that had lyrics introducing or commenting on the topic.http://www.kshe95.com/museum/index.aspx KSHE created a virtual museum on its website as a way of celebrating its 40th birthday. It contains video clips, audio clips, pictures and memorabilia. The first inductees (2007) were Rush, Kiss, Ted Nugent, and REO Speedwagon. In March 2010, KSHE held its annual March Bandness—the third-longest version of this contest in the US.March Bandness Along with the typical classic rock, KSHE's format also includes standard modern rock. KSHE also has various subgenres for various times of day, such as Hair Band Doran (DJ: Mike Doran) from 8pm-9pm weekdays (previously called '80s at 8 under the previous DJ, Katy Kruze) and Monday Night Metal with Tom \\"Real Rock\\" Terbrock on Tuesday nights from 9 pm to midnight (originally on Monday night at 10 pm with Radio/Radical Rich from the mid-'80s until 1987 when it was moved to Tuesday night, until it was canceled in the mid-'90s; returning with Terbrock in the summer of 2006). At 5 pm each weekday, KSHE plays \\"The Daily Dose\\", two Led Zeppelin songs presented with trivia about their creation or notable performances of the songs. Mascot The station mascot is a sunglasses-and-headphones-wearing pig named \\"Sweetmeat,\\" the likeness of which originally appeared on the cover of Blodwyn Pig's 1969 album 'Ahead Rings Out'. Like the pig pictured on the LP cover, Sweetmeat first appeared with a joint in his mouth. This \\"controversial\\" detail disappeared in the early '80s in favor of an updated, cartoon \\"rocker\\" pig. In recent years, the station has returned to using the original image, along with the original KSHE-95 text logo. At top, the cartoon Sweetmeat used in the 1980s; at bottom, \\"vintage\\" Sweetmeat used as of June 2013. Sweetmeat also inspired the name of Austin, Texas Christian Punk/Thrash band One Bad Pig.

Today, it operates approximately 31 active chapters and 1 colony and has approximately 28,000 initiated members. History and tradition Alpha Kappa Lambda was founded on April 22, 1914, by a group of young men attending the University of California, Berkeley. Its birth, however, dates back to 1906 when a group of friends discussed the \\"need of Christian men for a place to live and study that was within their (financial) means.\\" After assisting in the cleanup of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, four students re-addressed their desire to organize a house club during a YMCA conference in Pacific Grove, California. They decided to form \\"Los Amigos\\" in 1907, a house club named from the Spanish translation of \\"The Friends.\\" Shortly after, seven more men joined Los Amigos. Reverend Gail Cleland, one of the original eleven members of Los Amigos, recalled, \\"when we organized Los Amigos as a house club...house clubs and fraternities were dime a dozen. They came, they lived for a few months or a few years, then they went out of existence again. But Los Amigos did not go out of existence.\\" Fraternity motto The motto of the fraternity is \\"Aletheia Kai Logos,\\" which in Classical Greek means \\"The Truth and the Word\\". Fraternity badge The official badge of the fraternity is made of ten carat gold. An alpha and a lambda rest in the background (covered with the flowers of a dogwood, representing Christian principles) and the Kappa is raised, set with eleven whole pearls. The pearls represent the eleven founders of the Los Amigos Club. The badge is to be worn only on collared shirts, sweaters, or suit vests, and in the traditional position over the heart. It may only be worn by initiated members of the fraternity.  National service projects  =These Hands Don't Hurt= Alpha Kappa Lambda realizes that sexual assault is a serious problem on college campuses and believes that it can be fought through education, service, and philanthropic projects. The philanthropic fundraising aspect is the most visible of the three. The fundraising is performed via a \\"Promise Wall\\" displayed prominently in a high traffic area of campus. Students, faculty, and members of the community are asked to add their \\"hand\\" to the Promise Wall for a contribution of $1. By placing their \\"hand\\" on the wall they make a promise that their hand will not be used to harm others. These Hands Don't Hurt was started in ΑΚΛ by the Beta Zeta chapter (East Tennessee State University) in 1995.http://www.auburn.edu/student_info/greeks/alpha_kappa_lambda/philanthropy.html In the spirit of \\"growing the movement\\" Alpha Kappa Lambda has allowed other student organizations from around the country to use the program as a way to raise awareness about domestic violence. =Cystic Fibrosis= The fraternity adopted cystic fibrosis as a national philanthropy at the 1990 National Conclave. Chapters support the fight against cystic fibrosis in many ways. chapter fundraisers provide financial support to local organizations, research, and individuals. chapters provide manpower to help local organizations' events. Members can have holiday or birthday parties for children suffering from CF. There are countless ways to touch the lives of CF sufferers and their families. =Adopt-A-School= The Adopt-A-School program was endorsed by the National Executive Council during their 1994 Winter meeting. The goal of the program is to provide for the formation of one-on-one relationships between local college students and local elementary students. This program provides an opportunity for college students to give something back to their host communities while devoting time and energy to being a role model for children.

The roughly 35 species are all endemic to North and Central America. They are commonly known for their extensive tunneling activities and their ability to destroy farms and gardens. The name \\"pocket gopher\\" on its own may refer to any of a number of genera within the family Geomyidae. These are the \\"true\\" gophers, but several ground squirrels in the distantly related family Sciuridae are often called \\"gophers\\", as well. The origin of the word \\"gopher\\" is uncertain; French gaufre, meaning waffle, has been suggested, on account of the gopher tunnels resembling the honeycomb-like pattern of holes in a waffle; another suggestion is that the word is of Muskogean origin.A typical pocket gopher  Description  Gophers weigh around , and are about in body length, with a tail long. A few species reach weights approaching . Within any species, the males are larger than the females, and can be nearly double their weight. Average lifespans are one to three years. The maximum lifespan for the pocket gopher is about five years. Some gophers, such as those in the genus Geomys, have lifespans that have been documented as up to seven years in the wild. Most gophers have brown fur that often closely matches the color of the soil in which they live. Their most characteristic features are their large cheek pouches, from which the word \\"pocket\\" in their name derives. These pouches are fur-lined, can be turned inside out, and extend from the side of the mouth well back onto the shoulders. Gophers have small eyes and a short, hairy tail, which they use to feel around tunnels when they walk backwards. Pocket gophers have often been found to carry external parasites. Common predators of the gopher include weasels, snakes, and hawks. = Behavior = All pocket gophers create a network of tunnel systems that provide protection and a means of collecting food. They are larder hoarders, and their cheek pouches are used for transporting food back to their burrows. Gophers can collect large hoards. Unlike ground squirrels, gophers do not live in large communities and seldom find themselves above ground. Tunnel entrances can be identified by small piles of loose soil covering the opening. Burrows are in many areas where the soil is softer and easily tunneled. Gophers often visit vegetable gardens, lawns, or farms, as they like moist soil (see Soil biomantle). This has led to their frequent treatment as pests. Gophers eat plant roots, shrubs, and other vegetables such as carrots, lettuce, radishes, and any other vegetables with juice. Some species are considered agricultural pests. The resulting destruction of plant life then leaves the area a stretch of denuded soil. At the same time, the soil disturbance created by turning it over can lead to the early establishment of ecological succession in communities of r-selected and other ruderal plant species. The stashing and subsequent decomposition of plant material in the gophers' larder can produce deep fertilization of the soil. Pocket gophers are solitary outside of the breeding season, aggressively maintaining territories that vary in size depending on the resources available. Males and females may share some burrows and nesting chambers if their territories border each other, but in general, each pocket gopher inhabits its own individual tunnel system. Although they attempt to flee when threatened, they may attack other animals, including cats and humans, and can inflict serious bites with their long, sharp teeth. Depending on the species and local conditions, pocket gophers may have a specific annual breeding season, or may breed repeatedly through the year. Each litter typically consists of two to five young, although this may be much higher in some species. The young are born blind and helpless, and are weaned around 40 days old. Control Geomys and Thomomys species are classed as \\"prohibited new organisms\\" under New Zealand's Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, preventing them from being imported into the country.

LAUSD Journal. July 6, 2011. The purpose is to cluster students of similar capabilities and needs with teachers who can challenge them with greater academic and intellectual rigor while meeting their social and emotional needs. These relatively small programs are housed on larger campuses. In a Los Angeles Times review that separated Magnet test scores from their host schools, HGMs consistently had the highest standardized test scores of all LAUSD schools.\\"Magnet test scores unveiled \\". Los Angeles Times. Retrieved July 22, 2012. Purposes of clustering Despite their high scores, highly gifted children are especially vulnerable to so-called risks of giftedness, such as social isolation, de-motivation, low self-esteem, and deliberate underachievement. Research has shown that highly gifted children are different not only because of higher IQ scores, but that there are cognitive differences in the ways that they think, learn, and relate to others.\\"Exceptionally Gifted Children: Different Minds\\". SENG HGM schools bring together specialized teachers and compatible peers to give these children the challenge and support they need to develop to their maximum potential. Eligibility Eligibility to most HGMs is restricted to students who test at least in the 99.5th percentile on an intellectual giftedness assessment conducted by an LAUSD psychologist (equivalent to IQ of 140+). Priority is given to students with 99.9%, officially \\"Highly Gifted\\" by LAUSD definition (IQ 145+). If there are openings remaining, students with 99.5%-99.8% (considered \\"Highly Gifted Applicable\\") can be admitted. Priority within the HG-Applicable group is not based on IQ score but rather on Magnet points. IQ testing and eligibility is determined by the LAUSD's GATE (Gifted and Talented) office. Parents may request an IQ test by contacting the GATE Coordinator at their LAUSD school, but would need to justify why they believe their children may be highly gifted, above normal levels of giftedness that can be identified by the OLSAT test (see next paragraph). Beginning in 2011, all LAUSD second graders were given the OLSAT, an \\"ability test\\" (not IQ test) which may qualify students for regular Gifted/High Ability programs but NOT for Highly Gifted programs. If parents believe the OLSAT does not adequately reflect their child's intellectual capacity or that they need the higher challenge and social clustering of a Highly Gifted program, they can still request an IQ/intellectual assessment by contacting the GATE Coordinator at their school. Students must be currently enrolled in a LAUSD school to be eligible for LAUSD-administered testing. Students in LAUSD-affiliated charter schools are also eligible for testing but the school needs to pay LAUSD $75 per test because the school already received funds that would normally be allocated to LAUSD's GATE program. In all cases, families will need to justify why they believe their children may be highly gifted, above normal levels of giftedness that can be identified by the OLSAT test (see above paragraph). Admission Admission is usually through online eCHOICES Magnet applications, which are open around October-November for admission the following September. Students must already have been tested and officially identified as eligible for their application to go through. Eligible students might also enroll during the school year if the HGM has openings. To do this, parents must contact the Magnet Coordinator at the HGM school. Because these are unusual programs in their curriculum, pedagogy and community, HGM schools highly recommend touring their classes before applying. School bus transportation is available for students who live a certain distance from campus. Many students commute from great distances to attend HGM schools.

The largest is Delafield's never-built design; the irregular pentagon is the fort that exists today. Drawn by Lt. Montgomery C. Meigs. Fort Delaware is a former harbor defense facility, designed by chief engineer Joseph Gilbert Totten and located on Pea Patch Island in the Delaware River.Dobbs, Kelli W., et al. During the American Civil War, the Union used Fort Delaware as a prison for Confederate prisoners of war, political prisoners, federal convicts, and privateer officers. A three-gun concrete battery of 12-inch guns, later named Battery Torbert, was designed by Maj. Charles W. Raymond and built inside the fort in the 1890s. By 1900, the fort was part of a three fort concept, the first forts of the Coast Defenses of the Delaware, working closely with Fort Mott in Pennsville, New Jersey, and Fort DuPont in Delaware City, Delaware. The fort and the island currently belong to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) and encompass a living history museum, located in Fort Delaware State Park.  Background  In 1794, the French military engineer Pierre Charles L’Enfant was surveying for defensive sites. He identified an island that he called \\"Pip Ash\\" as an ideal site for the defense of the prize of American commerce and culture. The island that L'Enfant called Pip Ash was locally known as Pea Patch Island. This island was mostly unaffected by humanity with one exception. Dr. Henry Gale, a New Jersey resident, used Pea Patch as a private hunting ground. Gale was offered $30,000 for the island by the US Army, but he refused. The military was determined to get the island, so they appealed to the state of Delaware, which claimed ownership of the entire Delaware River and all islands therein within a twelve mile circle around New Castle's Court House. The state legislature passed an act in May 1813 ceding the island to the United States government, which subsequently seized it from Gale. In 1820, seeking to resolve questions surrounding the ownership of the island, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun requested a legal opinion from Attorney General William Wirt. Wirt's conclusion, based on a report by George Read, Jr. and former Attorney General Caesar A. Rodney was that the state of Delaware had the valid claim to the island, and so New Jersey could not have properly deeded it to Gale. War of 1812 During the War of 1812, efforts were made to fortify Pea Patch Island. This plan of defense was largely coordinated by Capt. Samuel Babcock, who was working nearby on similar defenses in Philadelphia. During this time a seawall and dykes were built around the island. There is no known evidence that any progress was made on the actual fortification by war's end. The original plan was to build a Martello tower on the island. One source states that an earthwork fort was built on the island during the war and torn down in 1821; also, a wooden fort existed from 1814 to 1824. Star fort Construction of a star fort on Pea Patch island began sometime before December 8, 1817. Chief Engineer Joseph Gardner Swift mentions a fort on the \\"Pea Patch in Delaware River\\" among forts that are progressing nicely.The Papers of John C. Calhoun, Letter from Brig. Gen. Joseph Gardner Swift, Chief Engineer to John C. Calhoun. Dec 8, 1817. Vol II, page 4. =Fort Mifflin's replacement= The attack on Fort Mifflin during the Revolutionary War proved that a fort was needed further away from Philadelphia in order to delay possible invaders. A fortification further downriver would also provide protection for other vital port cities such as Chester, Marcus Hook, Wilmington, and New Castle. On February 7, 1821, the Board of Engineers reported: \\"In the Delaware, the fort on the Pea Patch island, and one on the Delaware shore opposite, defend the water passage as far below Philadelphia as localities will permit: They force an enemy to land forty miles below the city to attack it by land, and thus afford time for the arrival of succors [...] The two projected forts will also have the advantages of covering the canal destined to connect the Chesapeake with the Delaware[.]\\"Mackie, Brendan., Peter K. Morrill, Laura M. Lee. Images of America: Fort DuPont. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2011., p 14. The fort on the Delaware shore was not built until the Civil War. =Construction issues= The star fort was designed by army engineer Joseph G. Totten and construction was supervised by Capt. Samuel Babcock.Dobbs, Kelli. et al, 1999: p.7 The five-pointed star design is viewed as \\"transitional\\" between the second and third systems of US fortifications. The fort was designed in 1815 and construction began within a few years. Babcock supervised the work from about August 1819 until August 20, 1824.American State Papers: Documents, Legislative and Executive, of the Congress of the United States, From the First Session to the Second Session of the Eighteenth Congress, Inclusive. Commencing December 27, 1819, and ending February 28, 1825. Washington: Gales and Seaton, 1834. Lt. Henry Brewerton was also on site, serving as an assistant engineer during the construction. Completion of the project was delayed years past the proposed date due to uneven settling, improper pile placement and the island's marshy nature. In one occurrence an entire section of 43,000 bricks had to be taken down, cleaned, and reworked due to massive cracking. In 1822, Colonel Totten and General Simon Bernard were on the island to inspect the faulty works. Captain Babcock was severely criticized for altering Totten's plans without orders. Babcock subsequently appeared before a court-martial for his actions in late 1824. It was determined he was not guilty of neglect but rather error in judgement and he was acquitted. During the trial his counsel was George Read Jr. of New Castle, Del. =Commanders and garrison= Fort Delaware's first documented commander was Maj. Alexander C.W. Fanning, who took command prior to 1825. That year, a letter documenting a lost mail shipment was written by him as post commander. Army records document that the fort was manned by soldiers of the 2nd U.S. Artillery. Circa 1829, Major Benjamin Kendrick Pierce took command of Fort Delaware. During his tenure, the fort was garrisoned by Companies A and B, 4th U.S. Artillery. Major Pierce was the older brother of the 14th President of the United States, Franklin Pierce. =1831 fire= In February 1831, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sent Lt. Stephen Tuttle to evaluate the foundation issue and offer possible solutions. On February 8, 1831, around 10:30 p.m, a fire originating in Lieutenant Tuttle's quartersLee, Laura M. et al., 2010: p.12. destroyed much of the work, burning until the next morning. Maj. Pierce, the post commander, was granted orders to use the federal arsenal in New Castle, Del. as barracks for his two companies until \\"Fort Delaware can be reoccupied.\\" Captain Richard Delafield, Babcock's replacement, asked for $10,000 to tear down the remaining structure the following year. In 1833, Fort Delaware was torn down to make room for a new fortification. According to official records, the rubble from the star fort served to reinforce the seawall around the island. The sandstone remnants can still be seen today. Polygonal Fort Captain Delafield designed the second version of Fort Delaware \\"as a huge bastioned polygonal form to be built in masonry.\\"Dobbs, Kelli W., et al. 1999, p. 7 Delafield desired his fort to be \\"a marvel of military architecture on Pea Patch\\", and the design was much larger than the star fort. In 1836, excavation work progressed on the north side of the island. Grillage timbers were driven into the island's soft mud to serve as a base for the foundation of Delafield's fort. In 1838, James Humphrey of New Jersey (a descendant of Dr. Henry Gale) sent legal representation to the island, claiming he had legal rights to the island.Catts, Coleman and Custer, p. 27, from \\"Substance of the Argument of John Clayton, of Delaware, for the United States in the matter of Pea Patch Island.\\" Philadelphia: J and G.S. Gideon, 1848, p.6 This began a decade-long legal battle over the island's ownership, which prevented Delafield's fort from being built. After conflicting opinions from two different circuit courts, President James K. Polk suggested an arbitrator resolve the disagreement, and Secretary of War William Marcy and Humphrey agreed. John Sergeant was appointed arbitrator, and in late 1847 heard arguments from the United States (represented by Senators John M. Clayton and James A. Bayard, Jr.) and Humphrey (represented by former Secretary of War John Eaton and former Secretary of the Treasury George M. Bibb). On January 15, 1848, he ruled that the island had belonged to the state of Delaware and therefore the title given to the United States government was valid. It appears no further work was done on this fort. Pentagonal fort The present Fort Delaware was erected mainly between 1848 and 1860 as one of the larger forts of the third system of US fortifications. Although major construction was wrapped up before the Civil War, the post engineer did not declare the fort finished until 1868.Dobbs, Kelli W., Life Outside These Walls: A Study of Community Life on Pea Patch Island, Fort Delaware, 1848-1860.Newark, DE: University of Delaware, Spring 1999. Construction of the counterscarp wall, slate pavement, and \\"hanging shutters and doors\\" was still ongoing.Record Group 77: Records of the Office of the Chief of Engineers. National Archives and Records Administration, Philadelphia Branch.Dobbs, Kelli W., Life Outside These Walls, 1999, p. 38. The fort was designed by Army chief engineer Joseph G. Totten, and construction was supervised by Major John Sanders. Engineers in supporting roles included Captain George B. McClellan, Major John Newton, Lieutenant William Price Craighill, Lieutenant Montgomery C. Meigs and civilian engineer Edwin Muhlenbrach.Dobbs, Kelli W., et al., 1999. The fort was about the size and location of the previous star fort. It was in the shape of an irregular pentagon, with five small bastions at the corners, called \\"tower bastions\\" by Totten. Four of the sides were seacoast fronts, with three tiers of cannon on each, two casemated tiers in the fort and one barbette tier on the roof. The irregular shape provided for more cannon on the east-facing fronts, where the deeper channel was. A total of 123 heavy cannon could be mounted on the seacoast fronts, with 15 more in the bastions. The long rear front was called a \\"gorge wall\\", with two tiers totaling 68 loopholes for muskets and a tier of 11 cannon on the roof. In the center of this wall was the sally port, the only entrance to or exit from the fort. Twenty short-range flank howitzers could be mounted in the bastions to defeat attacks on the curtain walls. Thus, the fort had positions for 169 cannon. The fort also had a moat, with a tide gate on a canal from the river to control the moat's level. =Foundation= Construction of a deep foundation was necessary since the island's soils were of \\"a compressible mud often forty feet deep; the level where sand was finally reached\\".Dobbs, Kelli W., Life Outside These Walls, 1999, p. 40. In 1849, Sanders' crews began using steam-powered pile drivers to place long piles (similar to modern telephone poles) in excavated areas to provide adequate support. In 1850 pile driving was complete; crews had driven 4,911 piles, reusing 1,095 piles from the Delafield fort.Dobbs, Kelli W., Life Outside These Walls, 1999, pp. 39-41. Because of the star fort's failed foundation, Totten and Sanders decided to evaluate the weight resistance before moving forward with construction. The engineers proposed a singular test consisting of 30 blows from an 8-foot height using an 800 pound weight. A total of 5,754 piles were tested and 2,955 failed more than one fifth of an inch. Roughly 1,700 piles were subsequently spliced and re-driven an additional 10 to 20 feet. The pile driving was finally complete in 1851 and the wooden grillage was the next layer constructed. =Stonework= The fort is primarily composed of gneiss, granite, brick, and cement. Initially, the stone for the scarp wall was gneiss imported from Port Deposit, Maryland.Dobbs, Kelli, et al, 1999: p.11 In 1852, Major Sanders reported the gneiss was too hard for his stone masons and cutters to shape, slowing the progress of construction. After that, purchase records show granite was bought from John Leiper's quarry in nearby Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Leiper's granite was also used throughout for various items such as the steps for the circular stairways. Stone from Vinalhaven, Maine was used for the stairways' large platforms.Snyder, Frank E., Brian H. Guss. The District: A History of the Philadelphia District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1866-1971. Library of Congress, January 1974, pp. 56-57. A huge storm damaged the island's dyke and seawall in 1854. Due to the threat of high-tide waters, efforts were directed toward repairing the dyke and adjacent seawall, slowing progress on the stonework. =Brickwork= More than two million bricks were purchased from Wilmington, Del. and Philadelphia, Pa. for the scarp wall's interior. These bricks were used in construction of underground cisterns, casemates, powder magazines, soldier barracks, officer quarters, bread ovens and the fort's breast high wall. Masonry arches and vaults were used throughout the entire fort to equally distribute weight and to provide stability. Poured concrete was used as a layer above the vaults to offer counter resistance and to \\"create a strong floor system\\".Dobbs, Kelli, et al, 1999: p.12 =Major Sanders dies= On July 29, 1858, Major Sanders died on the island due to \\"complications of carbunculous boils\\"; Lt. William Craighill replaced him until Maj. John Newton was able to assume the role of supervising engineer. In 1859, in official correspondence, Major Newton reported that the fort would be ready to arm and garrison by 1860. In 1861, before the war started, Capt. Augustus A. Gibson took command of the fort and a small garrison of only 20 regular army soldiers. Construction languished until the end of the Civil War; the garrison's focus was centered on mounting cannon inside the fort. In 1861, 20 columbiad guns were received and work to mount these guns quickly began. By 1862, another 17 guns were delivered. By 1866, approximately 156 guns were mounted in total, filling the fort's casemates and ramparts to capacity. Civil War During the Civil War, Fort Delaware went from protector to prison; a prisoner-of-war camp was established to house captured Confederates, convicted federal soldiers, and local political prisoners as well as privateers.Wilson, W. Emerson., A Fort Delaware Journal: The Diary of a Yankee Private, A.J. Hamilton, 1862-65, Wilmington, DE: Fort Delaware Society, 1981. The first prisoners were housed inside the fort in sealed off casemates, empty powder magazines, and two small rooms inside the sally port. In those small rooms, names of Confederates can still be seen carved into the brick. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the island \\"contained an average population of southern tourists, who came at the urgent invitation of Mr. Lincoln\\". The first Confederate general to be housed at the fort was Brig. Gen. Johnston Pettigrew. During the war, a total of about a dozen generals were held within the fort as prisoners-of-war. =Barracks & hospital= In 1862 and 1863, two separate phases of construction took place, building a \\"barracks for enlisted prisoners of war\\" that was known as the \\"bull pen,\\" said Pvt. Henry Robinson Berkeley a Confederate prisoner.Berkeley, Henry R., Four years in the Confederate Artillery: The Diary of Private Henry Robinson Berkeley. Richmond, VA: Virginia Historical Society, 1991., p. 128. Most of the Confederates captured at Gettysburg were imprisoned here. An L-shaped barracks building, using similar plans, was constructed for Union soldiers assigned as guards. A 600-bed hospital was also built around the same time and was designed by architect John McArthur Jr. of Philadelphia. \\"These Barracks [sic] were common wooden sheds, affording accommodation for about ten thousand persons,\\" wrote Lt. Francis W. Dawson, a Confederate POW captured in August 1862. \\"The bunks were arranged in tiers of three, and into one of these I crawled. The next morning I was told that these Barracks were the quarters for the privates and non-commissioned officers, and that, by requesting it, I could be removed to the quarters for the officers, which were inside the Fort.\\"Dawson, Francis W., Reminiscences of Confederate Service, 1861-1865. Baton Rouge and London: Louisiana State University Press, 1980., pp. 72-73. =Mortality rate= The first Confederate prisoner to die at Fort Delaware was Captain L. P. Halloway of the 27th Virginia Infantry. He was captured at Winchester, Va. on March 23, 1862, dying on April 9.Philadelphia Inquirer, Local Intelligence, Matters at Fort Delaware. July 21, 1862, p. 8. Captain Halloway, a Freemason, was given a full Masonic funeral by Jackson Lodge in Delaware City. The funeral procession was led by fort's commander, Captain Augustus A. Gibson, from the town's lock on Clinton Street, and ended in the cemetery on Jefferson Street. According to church records, Halloway's body was reclaimed by his family after the war. By August 1863, there were more than 11,000 prisoners on the island; by war’s end, it had held almost 33,000 men. The conditions were relatively decent, but about 2,500 prisoners died on Pea Patch Island.Jamison, Jocelyn P., They Died at Fort Delaware 1861-1865: Confederate, Union and Civilian. Delaware City, DE: Fort Delaware Society, 1997Jamison, Jocelyn P., 1997., referencing House Report No. 45. Statistically, the overall death rate for prisoners was about 7.6 percent. Half of the total number of deaths occurred during a smallpox epidemic in 1863. Inflammation of the lungs (243 deaths), various forms of diarrhea (315 deaths) and smallpox (272 deaths) were the leading killers amongst the prison population.Jamison, Jocelyn P., 1997., pp. 91-94.Mowday, Bruce., and Dale Fetzer, Unlikely Allies: Fort Delaware's Prison Community in the Civil War, Stackpole Books, 2000. About 215 prisoners died as a result of typhoid and/or malaria, according to records in the National Archives. Other causes of death include scurvy (70 deaths), pneumonia (61 deaths) and erysipelas (47 deaths). Five prisoners drowned, and seven died from gunshot wounds. During the war, 109 Union soldiers and about 40 civilians died on the island as well.Jamison, Jocelyn P., 1997., pp. 85-90. Many of the Confederate prisoners and Union guards who died at the fort are buried in the nearby Finn's Point National Cemetery in Pennsville, New Jersey. =Prisoner rations and living conditions (outside the fort)= By 1863, enlisted men and junior officers (mostly lieutenants and captains) of the prison population were living in the wooden barracks on the northwest side of the island. These two classes of prisoners were separated by a tall fence complete with a catwalk for the guards. In 1864, the War Department ordered the rations to be cut in retaliation for the treatment of Northern soldiers in southern POW camps. Although prisoners were only receiving two small meals, they were allowed to purchase extra food from the sutler, and allowed to fish in the waterways on the island and in the Delaware River.Handy, Isaac W.K., United States Bonds Or Duress By Federal Authority: A Journal Of Current Events During An Imprisonment Of Fifteen Months, At Fort Delaware, Turnbull Brothers, 1874. Official records also show that prisoners at Fort Delaware received more \\"care packages\\" than any other POW camp in the country. \\"Things here are not quite as bad as I expected to find them. They are, however, bad, hopeless and gloomy enough without any exaggeration,\\" said Pvt. Henry Berkeley. \\"We went into dinner about three o'clock, which consisted of three hardtack, a small piece of meat (about three bites) and a pint tin cup of bean soup. We only get two light meals a day.\\"Berkley, 1999., p. 129. \\"The mess-room is next to [Division] 22 and near the rear. It is a long, dark room, having a long pine table, on which the food is placed in separate piles, either on a tin plate or on the uncovered greasy table, at meal hours, twice a day,\\" said Capt. Robert E. Park, 12th Alabama Infantry Regiment. \\"The fare consists of a slice of baker's bread, very often stale, with weak coffee, for breakfast, and a slice of bread and a piece of salt pork or salt beef, sometimes, alternating with boiled fresh beef and bean soup, for dinner. The beef is often tough and hard to masticate.\\" \\"There are several large ditches running across the island which are filled daily by the bay water and which furnish the water for washing,\\" wrote Capt. William H. Burgwyn, 35th North Carolina Infantry. \\"Our drinking water is brought from Brandywine Creek about ten miles [away].\\"Schiller, Herbert M., edited, A Captain's War: The Letters and Diaries of William H. S. Burgwyn, 1861-1865. Shippensburg, PA: White Mane Publishing Company, Inc., 1994., p. 160. =Prisoner rations and living conditions (inside the fort)= High-ranking Confederate officers and some political prisoners were housed in former laundress quarters and open-bay barrack rooms inside the fort.Handy, Isaac W.K., 1874., pp. 13-16.Rosenburg, R.B., \\"For The Sake of My Country\\": The Diary of Col. W. W. Ward., 9th Tennessee Cavalry, Morgan's Brigade, C. S. A. Murfreesboro, TN: Southern Heritage Press, 1992., pp. 24-26. These prisoners were often afforded paroles of the island, access to more food, and allowed more freedoms than the outside prison population. \\"By the kindness of Gen. Albin Francisco Schoepf (the fort's commandant), Cols. Morgan, Tucker, Coleman and myself were paroled to the Island\\", said Col. William W. Ward, on March 24, 1864. Gen. M. Jeff Thompson, Gen. Robert B. Vance and the Cols of our command form a mess, and live very well. We give a negro woman $7.00 per week for cooking, $10.00 for washing.\\"Rosenburg, R.B., 1992., pp. 24-25. Also living in the former laundress quarters was Reverend Isaac W. K. Handy of Portsmouth, Va., a political prisoner. \\"Our supplies have, recently, been so abundant, that \\"Commissary\\" Tibbetts has appropriated [Room] No. 3 as a larder and pantry. We have been living upon hams, turkeys, chickens, tongues, jellies, pickles, butter, cheese, canned fruits, and jellies of various kinds, with all else that could be desired for comfortable and healthy diet,\\" wrote Reverend Handy in 1864. He further notes, \\"The only article regularly furnished by the Government commissary is bread. Each man gets a well baked loaf, every other day, which is quite sufficient in quantity.\\"Handy, Isaac W.K., 1874. pp. 336-347. \\"We were installed in a large barrack-room, which then contained seventy or eighty officers. The highest in rank was a Major Holliday,\\" wrote Lt. Francis W. Dawson. \\"Our room was dry, warn and well lighted, while the Barracks [outside of the fort] were cold, damp and dark. Our room had conveniences for washing [...], and there was plenty of water of a poor quality,\\" said Dawson. \\"We only left the room to march down into the mess-hall.\\"Dawson, Francis W., 1980., pp. 73-74. In late 1862, prisoners inside the fort were fed three meals a day instead of the usual two. \\"For breakfast we had a cup of poor coffee without milk or sugar, and two small pieces of bad bread. For dinner we had a cup of greasy water misnamed soup, a piece of beef two inches square and a half inch thick, and two slices of bread. At supper the fare was the same as at breakfast. This was exceedingly light diet,\\" wrote Lt. Francis Dawson. \\"We contrived to make some additions to our diet by purchases at the Sutler's store.\\"Dawson, Francis W., 1980., p. 73. =The \\"Immortal 600\\"= On August 20, 1864, six hundred Confederate officers boarded the Crescent bound for Morris Island, S.C., \\"for the purpose I believe of being placed under the fire of the Confederate batteries in retaliation for an equal number of Federal officers who have been placed in the city of Charleston, and are said to be exposed to the shelling of their own guns. I am glad of this move as it will be a diversion to the monotonous life led in prison,\\" said Capt. Leon Jastremski of the 10th Louisiana Infantry. This group of prisoners was later known as the \\"Immortal Six Hundred\\".Pinkowski, Edward. Pills, Pen & Politics: The Story of General Leon Jastremski, 1843-1907. Wilmington, DE: Captain Stanislaus Mlotkowski Memorial Brigade Society, 1974., pp. 62-63. \\"Aug. 20 - Am detailed to go to Charleston with the Rebel Officers. Was very busy in the forenoon hunting up shoes and packing up things,\\" said Pvt. Alexander J. Hamilton, Pittsburgh Heavy Artillery. \\"At 3 p.m. we fell in and marched up to the barracks and by 5 were on board the Crescent and under way. There are 35 of our boys and about 90 of the other two batteries and of Company C, 157th Ohio [Infantry].\\"Wilson, Emerson E., 1981., pp. 58-59. \\"After long delay - all being ready - the guards took their places, and the command was given to march through the sally-port, to the west end of the \\"bull-pen\\",\\" according to Reverend Isaac Handy. \\"As the noble fellows marched out, I stood at the opening of the sally-port, as near by as the guards would allow, and until the very last man disappeared from the enclosure. 'Good-bye! Good-bye!' was uttered, time and again, as the files moved on; and I could do nothing but return farewells, as some one or more in every rank would wave the parting salutation.\\"Handy, Isaac W.K., 1873., pp. 514-515. =Garrison units= Starting in 1861, volunteer troops were sent to garrison Fort Delaware that included Collis' Zouaves d' Afrique,Hagerty, Edward J., Collis' Zouaves: The 114th Pennsylvania Volunteers in the Civil War. Baton Rouge and London: Louisiana State University Press, 1997. pp. 26-27. the 19th New York Volunteers, Mlotkowski's Independent Battery A, Young's Independent Battery G (Pittsburgh Heavy Artillery), 5th Delaware Infantry, 6th Delaware Infantry, 9th Delaware Infantry, 5th Maryland Infantry, 11th Maryland Infantry, 6th Massachusetts Militia, 157th Pennsylvania Infantry (Battalion), 201st Pennsylvania Infantry, 215th Pennsylvania, 157th Ohio Infantry, 196th Ohio Infantry, and Zouaves of the 165th New York Infantry.Wilson, W. Emerson., 1981., p. 82. The fort was also used to organize and muster troops from Delaware. Ahl's Independent Battery of Heavy Artillery was organized at the fort on July 27, 1863 for garrison duty. Although listed as a Delaware unit, Ahl's Battery was composed of Confederate prisoners that took the oath of allegiance. The fort's artillery soldiers were responsible for manning the guard posts within the fort as well as serving on various duty positions on the island. Infantry troops were mainly responsible for manning guard posts along the seawall, which ran around the island. In August 1864, there were approximately 85 guard posts on the island that required about 255 men on each shift.Fletcher, William J. A Soldier for One Hundred Days, Madison: WI, 1955. 1870s and 1880s After the Civil War, the fort was operated by a small garrison of the 4th U.S. Artillery. In the early 1870s, plans were made to modify the five bastions to support 15-inch Rodman guns. During the Civil War a ten-gun battery was built on the river's west bank near the later Fort DuPont; this was rebuilt as a 20-gun battery in the 1870s but not fully armed. In October 1878, a massive hurricane struck the area causing considerable damage to structures outside the fort. The majority of buildings on the south side of the island were destroyed. The Trinity Chapel, built in 1863 by Confederate POWs, was partially destroyed in the storm. The chapel was subsequently used to store hay until totally demolished sometime after 1901. On August 3, 1885, a tornado struck the island, destroying the post-war hospital and caused considerable damage to other structures. \\"A storm took place here. We have had nothing like it since [October 1878] and a strong whirlwind with it, sweeping every thing before it, pulling trees out of the ground and carrying parts of the hospital all over the island and out on the river,\\" wrote Ordnance Sergeant James Maxwell.Maxwell, James., Letter to the Asst. Adjutant General, headquarters, Department of the East, New York Harbor, August 4, 1885. Spanish–American War Several years before the start of the war, in 1892, a mine control casemate was built on the northern tip of the island. This casemate was built semi-underground and then covered with dirt for concealment. This mining casemate served in conjunction with a one-story torpedo (mine storage) shed and a narrow-gauge railroad, which all supported water-tight mines that could be placed in the Delaware River as a defensive measure against a possible enemy attack. Another casemate at Fort DuPont was built for a mine field controlled by that fort. A similar mine casemate at Fort Delaware had been planned in the 1870s but never materialized due to lack of funding. =Modernization during the Endicott period= During the late 1890s new gun batteries were constructed at Fort Delaware. These batteries were part of a program initiated by the 1885 Board of Fortifications, a government board headed by Secretary of War William C. Endicott; the resulting system of fortifications is often called the Endicott program. Instead of many guns concentrated in a traditional thick-walled masonry structure, the Endicott batteries are spread out over a wide area, concealed behind concrete parapets flush with the surrounding terrain. As part of this program, Fort Delaware was supplemented by Fort DuPont on the river's west bank and Fort Mott on the east bank; these were the first forts of the Coast Defenses of the Delaware. Both of these were built new for the Endicott program, in both cases replacing earlier batteries. Part of an unfinished battery at Fort Mott from the 1870s was used for new batteries at that fort. In 1896, half of the soldier barracks and a set of officers' quarters were demolished inside the fort. The parade ground was excavated and thousands of piles were steam driven, to support a foundation for a concrete three-gun battery as a way to modernize the defenses protecting ports along the Delaware River. Construction halted for a brief period before resuming in August 1897. This main battery was designed by Army engineer Lt. Col. Charles W. Raymond, assisted by Lt. Spencer Cosby. The new Endicott structure was a three-story reinforced concrete emplacement, which was built from 1894 to 1900 to support three 12-inch breech-loading rifled guns on disappearing carriages. These guns, mounted in 1900, had a range of approximately 10 miles. The three-gun battery, later named Battery Torbert after Maj. Gen. Alfred Torbert, is one of two three-story Endicott batteries in the United States, the other being Battery Potter, with unique gun-lift carriages, at Fort Hancock, New Jersey.Lee, Laura M., Brendan Mackie. Images of America: Fort Delaware Arcadia Publishing, 2010. The unusual height of Battery Torbert was due to being initially designed for gun-lift carriages. On top of the fort, flanking the 12-inch battery, were two smaller rapid-fire batteries, which protected the short-range sectors around the island and the mine field. These positions were later named Battery Allen and Battery Alburtis, and were armed with two 3-inch M1898 guns on retractable masking parapet mounts each. They were built in 1899 and accepted for service in 1901. Outside of the fort, engineers built additional rapid-fire batteries, which were later named Battery Dodd and Battery Hentig. Battery Dodd was added as an emergency measure after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898. It had two 4.7-inch 40 caliber guns purchased from the United Kingdom; at that point few of the Endicott batteries were complete and it was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast. The battery was completed in 1899, after the war was over. Battery Hentig had two 3-inch M1903 guns and entered service in 1901. Battery Allen was named for Robert Allen, Jr., a cavalry officer who died at Gaines Mill in the Civil War. Battery Alburtis was named for William Alburtis, killed in the siege of Veracruz in the Mexican–American War. Battery Dodd was named for Captain Albert Dodd, also killed at Gaines Mill. Battery Hentig was named for Edmund C. Hentig, a cavalry officer killed fighting Native Americans at Cibiou Creek, Arizona in 1881. =Garrison units= During the Spanish–American War, the fort was garrisoned by artillery soldiers of the 4th U.S. Artillery and volunteers from Company I of the 14th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Names of soldiers from the 14th P.V.I. appear today, carved on the brick walls inside the fort. These soldiers were stationed on the island during the summer of 1898. World War I Following a period of caretaking status, the fort was garrisoned for a brief time during World War I. Nearby Fort DuPont was the main defense site, with Fort Delaware and Fort Mott serving as a sub-posts, according to army records.Mackie, Brendan., Peter K. Morrill, Laura M. Lee. Images of America: Fort DuPont. Charleston, SC: Arcadia Publishing, 2011. In March 1919, soldiers began the process of mothballing the old fort, removing everything except items pertaining to the three 12-inch guns of Battery Torbert, according to Pvt. James C. Davis, a Fort DuPont soldier who worked on the detail. In a Newark Post article, he recalls his orders were to bury everything with explicit orders not to throw anything in the river or remove articles from the island. According to Davis, soldiers buried three pieces of artillery on the island. Only one gun has since been recovered; a 15-inch Rodman gun exhumed from the northwest bastion was sold for scrap during World War II. The 4.7-inch guns of Battery Dodd were sent to San Francisco for use on Army troop transports; they were returned to Fort Delaware in 1919 but were soon removed from service and used as war memorials. In 1920 the 3-inch guns of Battery Alburtis and Battery Allen were scrapped as part of a general removal of M1898 3-inch guns from service. By the end of the First World War, Fort Saulsbury near Slaughter Beach, Del. was near completion, and with 12-inch guns on long-range carriages reduced the three upriver forts to secondary lines of defense. The Harbor Defenses of the Delaware were one of the most extreme examples of gun batteries being built seaward as gun ranges increased. World War II In 1940 Fort Delaware lost its three 12-inch guns, two of which were used to arm Battery Reed, Fort Amezquita in the Harbor Defenses of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the island was garrisoned by a detachment of soldiers from Battery C, 261st Coast Artillery Battalion, a unit from the Delaware Army National Guard. Battery C manned the two rapid-fire guns of Battery Hentig, located outside of the fort. These guns were removed in 1942 for use at Fort Miles in Lewes, Del., leaving Fort Delaware unarmed. Fort Miles, on the Atlantic Ocean south of Cape May, itself reduced Fort Saulsbury to a secondary line of defense. The fort was eventually stripped of the most of its electrical wiring, which was re-used at Fort Miles. Fort Delaware was declared as a surplus site by the federal government at the end of the war. The fort today Delaware acquired the fort from the United States government in 1947 after the federal government declared it a surplus site. Today, Fort Delaware State Park encompasses all of Pea Patch Island, including the Fort. As of 2018, transportation to Fort Delaware from Delaware City and Fort Mott is provided by a seasonal passenger ferry, the Forts Ferry Crossing. Once at the island, visitors are brought to the fort on a jitney. Tours and special programs are available to visitors. For example, visitors may see the 8 inch Columbiad gun, which is located on the northwest bastion, fired daily. Park staff and volunteers interpret the roles of people who were at the fort during the Civil War. Beach erosion affecting Pea Patch Island was recognized as a potential threat to the Fort in 1999. The United States Army Corps of Engineers erected a 3,500-foot-long seawall during the Winter of 2005-2006 which now protects the historical fort site and a migratory bird rookery, considered to be the largest such habitat north of Florida. =Popular events= Each year in the second week of June, there is an \\"Escape from Fort Delaware\\" triathlon, where entrants follow in the footsteps of the 52 escapees from the Civil War prison. A boat shuttles the athletes out to Fort Delaware, a Civil War historical interpreter fires a musket to start the race, the swimmers jump into the Delaware River, and swim back to land and then do the bike and run events, finishing on the town green in Delaware City, Delaware. Starting in 2009, Fort Delaware has hosted at least one game each summer of the Diamond State Base Ball Club, a vintage base ball team. The Diamond State Base Ball Club also typically plays 4-6 games per year at nearby Fort DuPont. The Diamond State Base Ball Club is a non-profit amateur organization created for the purposes of providing physical fitness to its members, educating the public on the history of baseball and local history, and serving as a point of public pride. =Television & pop culture= The A&E; Network's Civil War Journal recorded portions of an episode at the fort entitled \\"War Crimes: The Death Camps\\" that originally aired October 9, 1994. The Sci-Fi Channel investigation series Ghost Hunters conducted two cases there including a live televised investigation on Halloween in 2008. The Sci Fi Channel investigation series Ghost Hunters Academy recorded an episode, which aired June 23, 2010. The British series Most Haunted also did an investigation of the fort in their 11th series of the show.

Pool Re is a mutual reinsurer whose members comprise the vast majority of insurers and Lloyd’s Syndicates which offer commercial property insurance in the UK, with membership of the scheme affording them a guarantee which ensures that they can provide cover for losses resulting from acts of terrorism, regardless of the scale of the claims. The Scheme, which was the first public/private partnership to cover insured losses caused by acts of terrorism, is owned by its members but is underpinned by a HM Treasury commitment to support Pool Re if ever it has insufficient funds to pay a legitimate claim. Pool Re pays a premium to the Government for this guarantee and would repay the money over time if it ever used this facility. In the event of a loss resulting from an act of terrorism, each member must first pay losses up to a threshold that is determined individually for each insurer. If losses exceed that threshold, the insurer can claim upon Pool Re’s reserves. These reserves have been accumulated by the members of Pool Re since its inception. It is only in the event that these reserves are exhausted that Pool Re would draw upon Government support. History Pool Re was established following a series of terrorist incidents in the early 1990s in London and elsewhere in England related to the situation in Northern Ireland at that time. The cost of these losses caused insurers and reinsurers to consider ceasing to provide terrorism cover for commercial properties because of the high potential cost of losses and the lack of any reliable method of estimating what the future loss experience might be. Insurers depend on reinsurers for financial protection when very large claims occur and, accordingly, both insurers and reinsurers decided they could no longer provide terrorism cover using traditional methods. A withdrawal of terrorism insurance that left areas of business unprotected would potentially have had serious consequences for the UK economy. It became necessary, therefore, to devise a new mechanism for providing this type of cover, without leaving insurers or reinsurers open to substantial losses for which there was no reliable method of calculating accurate premiums. During the latter part of 1992 it became clear that any new scheme would require the joint involvement of the insurance industry and government. Following extensive dialogue, a suitable structure emerged and the details of the Pool Re scheme were developed. The Pool Re scheme began operations in 1993 and has subsequently been involved in claims arising from thirteen separate terrorism incidents covering losses of over £600 million. Changes to the scheme Since its inception, the scheme has adapted to changing circumstances in the insurance market. The most significant changes occurred after the attacks in America on September 11th 2001, which caused insurers and reinsurers to reconsider the way terrorism coverage should be offered. Until that date the conventional insurance and reinsurance market had been willing to dovetail the cover they provided with that available from the Pool Re scheme. Pool Re’s cover to insurers was restricted to damage caused by acts involving fire or explosion, and the international reinsurance market covered other types of terrorism. After 9/11, however, reinsurers were no longer in a position to do so. Had Pool Re continued with these restrictions, insurers would have been unable to provide their customers with cover for terrorist events not involving fire or explosion. In an attempt to avoid this situation, there were discussions between representatives of the insurance industry, buyers of insurance, the UK government, Pool Re and others. In July 2002 an agreement was reached to widen cover and amend certain other features of the scheme in a way that responded to these changing needs. In particular, Pool Re’s cover was extended to an “all risks” basis, and no longer restricted to fire or explosion. In addition, exclusions relating to chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) attack were removed. Risks related to war and cyber threats are still excluded until April 2018. Cyber-Terrorism cover On November 15, 2017 Steve Coates the Chief Underwriter for Pool Re announced wider cover, which now includes cyber-terrorism, and will be available from April 2018. The scope of our cover is designed to protect commercial property and will be offered as standard to all policyholders buying terrorism insurance from a Pool Re Member. \\"The cover is effectively Material Damage and direct Business Interruption (BI), so BI flows only from events happening at the policyholder’s premises. We will not be providing cover for intangible assets, specifically Money and Data, which are more appropriately covered by the cyber market.\\" See also *Terrorism Risk Insurance Act *Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation *Terrorism insurance  References Notes * External links *Pool Re website http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/riskcenter/terrorins.cfm * *HM Treasury: Pool reinsurance arrangements: technical notice to industry *Office of Fair Trading: Competition Act exemption for terrorism reinsurance by Pool Re Category:Financial services companies established in 1993 Category:Insurance companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Pool Re"},{"id":"2195254","text":"Glenn Mitchell (September 28, 1950 – November 20, 2005) was a radio personality from Dallas, Texas. Mitchell (who insisted that the only correct way to spell the name \\"Glenn\\" was with two \\"n\\"s) was born in Springfield, Missouri. He hosted a two-hour weekday talk show, The Glenn Mitchell Show, from 12 to 2 p.m. CST on NPR-member public radio station KERA 90.1 from 1995 to 2005. Mitchell interviewed a wide variety of guests on an even wider variety of subjects, showing a thirst for knowledge and an unusual skill at making his audience a part of the conversation. Shortly before his death he was praised by guest Mike Wallace, the CBS veteran reporter. Wallace noted that Mitchell was well known for being an extraordinary interviewer. Mitchell responded modestly, calling himself \\"the man who did his homework.\\" The popular \\"Anything You Ever Wanted to Know\\" edition of the show aired during the first hour every Friday with the tag line \\"All Questions Answered. All Knowledge Revealed.\\" Listeners called or emailed questions and answers to those questions every Friday, making it an interactive radio program for the audience. Occasionally, Mitchell would broadcast live from the Dallas Public Library. The librarians, or \\"professional smart people\\" as he referred to them, would help answer questions from callers. Mitchell won 19 Katie Awards from the Dallas Press Club, four of which were for best interview/talk show, and was recognized by the Dallas Observer's \\"Best of Dallas\\" awards. In 2006, Mitchell was inducted into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame and was honored posthumously by the Dallas Press Club with the Buck Marryatt Award for lifetime achievement. Mitchell also was known for the annual \\"Christmas Blockbuster\\" program, a 12-hour marathon of Christmas music, trivia, spoken word, and quizzes which ran for 30 years. A shorter version of the \\"Christmas Blockbuster\\" aired on national NPR as the \\"Christmas Stocking.\\" The Glenn Mitchell Show had been slated to begin airing nationally on XM Satellite Radio in February 2006.

He stepped down on 9 November 2009 in favor of Saad Hariri, the late Rafik Hariri's son. He is the leader of the parliamentary group of the Future Movement. Early life and education Sanioura was born into a Sunni Muslim family in Sidon on 19 July 1943. He earned a master of arts degree in Business Administration from the American University of Beirut after attending the American School for Boys in Sidon. Early career In the 1970s, Sanioura worked for Citibank and taught at the American University of Beirut, his alma mater, and at the Lebanese University. He then joined the audit committee at Lebanon's Central Bank in 1977. In 1982, he was recruited by Rafik Hariri to help him manage and expand his business empire. Upon the end of Lebanon's Civil War, Hariri became Lebanon's Prime Minister. Hariri appointed Sanioura as Minister of Finance in his successive cabinets. Sanioura was the Chairman and Managing Director of Groupe Mediterranee which encompasses four Hariri-owned banks. Member of National Assembly Siniora has strong ties with the international financial community. Strongly pro-business, he is considered a moderate partisan of free trade. He was a very close adviser to the late Rafik Hariri, and he is very close to his son Saad Hariri. He served as minister of state for financial affairs from 1992 to 1998, and as Minister of Finance from 2000 to 2004 during which he was the architect of the national debt that climbed from US $2 billion to US $50 billion. Siniora was the main architect of the Paris II Conference in November 2002 which allowed Lebanon to get US $2.6 billion, and the Paris III Conference in January 2007 which pledged 13 billion dollars to Lebanon. He was accused of corruption and mismanagement after Hariri's ousting in 1998, in what was mainly viewed as a conflict between Hariri and Syria, and a Syrian- orchestrated move to keep him in line. Siniora was cleared of all charges in 2003 by the parliament and the Judicial Court. In 2002, he abolished most of Lebanon's duty taxes and introduced a Value Added Tax. Prime minister After the victory of the anti-Syrian opposition in parliamentary elections held in May and June 2005, Fuad Siniora was asked by President Lahoud on 30 June 2005 to form a government. He resigned from the chairmanship of Group Méditerranée (a banking holding controlled by the Hariri family). After laborious negotiations with the President and the different political forces, Siniora formed a government on 19 July 2005. It is the first government formed after the Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and the first government to include members of the pro-Iranian militant group Hezbollah. In regard to Hezbollah, the Siniora cabinet's official stance in the Pre-Doha Government was that \\"The government considers the resistance a natural and honest expression of the Lebanese people’s national rights to liberate their land and defend their honour against Israeli aggression and threats\\". 2006 Lebanon War On 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched a deadly cross-border attack against Israel Israel started a 33-day heavy bombardment and land invasion of Lebanon, also known as the 2006 Lebanon War.ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) (18 July 2008). Israel buries soldiers recovered in prisoner swap. On 27 July 2006, Siniora, seeking to end the conflict, presented a seven-point Siniora Plan at a 15-nation conference in Rome. Siniora also called for an Arab League meeting in Beirut. During a televised address at the conference, he famously \\"sobbed\\" as he described the effects of the war on the Lebanese people.Siniora's Tears, Asharq Alawsat Newspaper. On 12 August 2006, Siniora cautiously welcomed the newly passed UNSCR 1701. The Lebanese Government even declared that unauthorised rocket launches towards Israel would constitute high treason, as the Israelis \\"would gain much propaganda\\". Events leading to the Doha Agreement On 13 November 2006, Shiite ministers backed by Hezbollah and Amal resigned from Siniora's cabinet. This took place on the eve of the day when the Special Tribunal for Lebanon trying the murderers of Rafik Hariri was to be discussed in a cabinet meeting. Although there were only six resigning ministers, nearly 40% of the Lebanese MPs are in the opposition. The Lebanese opposition claimed that this resignation meant that the Siniora Government was not a legitimate one because it did not represent all religious groups in Lebanon, namely the Shiite Lebanese. According to the constitution, the government is legal as long as it has two-thirds of the ministers, and so the majority believed the Siniora government was still a totally legal cabinet.Lebanese Constitution: http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/le00t___.html The opposition demanded an increase in opposition representation in the cabinet, sufficient to hold veto power over decision making, as their requirement for returning. The majority saw this as a Syrian-orchestrated move to block the establishment of the Hariri tribunal. On 1 December 2006, the parliamentary minority, primarily the pro-Syrian parties of Amal, Hezbollah and the Free Patriotic Movement of Michael Aoun launched a campaign of street demonstrations with the goal of getting veto power in the government. The country was further put into paralysis when the opposition refused to attend the parliament and vote for a new president, after Emile Lahoud's Presidential term expired. This meant the Fuad Siniora was an acting president until the new president was voted in. The demonstrations continued for 17 months until 7 May 2008 (which was a reply to 5 May 2008). The day is remembered by many Lebanese as the darkest day they had witnessed since the end of the Lebanese Civil War. Hizbollah, Amal, Syrian Social Nationalist Party, amongst others launched an armed strike against Beirut. The Rafik Hariri Intl. Airport, the Government's Grand Serail, and houses of Majority leaders, Saad Hariri and Walid Jumblatt, were all put under siege. Mount Lebanon was also attacked in the operation. Vengeance attacks broke out in other areas of Lebanon. It is thought that about 200 people died in the few days of fighting. The Beirut siege ended shortly after the Lebanese leaders met in Doha and agreed to what is referred to as the Doha Agreement. The agreement promised the minority veto power, led to the election of President Michel Suleiman, and a promise to the majority the weapons will no longer be used for internal political gains. Personal life Siniora is known for his interest in Arab literature and poetry. He also participates in the annual Global Baku Forum, and is a member of the Nizami Ganjavi International Center, a global policy think-tank composed primarily of current and former presidents and prime ministers, and has lately contributed an article Are there new possibilities for the Middle East? for its journal.

Alleged parentage Recent scholarship (particularly by Mollie Gillen, who was granted access to the Royal Archive at Windsor Castle)The Prince and His Lady- The Love Story of the Duke of Kent and Madame de St Laurent, Mollie Gillen, Griffin Press Ltd, 1970, pp. 25, 44 has established that no children were born of the 27-year relationship between Edward Augustus and Madame de Saint-Laurent; although many Canadian families and individuals (including the Nova Scotian soldier Sir William Fenwick Williams, 1st Baronet)http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/williams_william_fenwick_11E.html have claimed descent from them, such claims can now be discounted in light of this new research.Elizabeth Longford, ‘Edward, Prince, duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767–1820)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Based on the absence of birth or baptism records for Wood (with such an absence often considered to be indicative of royal descent), subsequent generations of the Wood family had a tradition that claimed that the infant Wood was given by the Prince to his former servant, Robert Wood senior. Exactly when Robert Wood and his parentage became the subject of such speculation is unclear, but the only source appears to have been the family itself.The Affair of the Veiled Murderess: An Antebellum Scandal and Mystery, Jeanne Winston Adler, State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 263 Parentage Wood was in fact the biological son of the aforementioned Robert Wood, who was a servant to the Prince when he went to Quebec in 1791. Robert Wood senior married, in December of that year, Marie Dupuis (also known as Marie Caton). Subsequently appointed doorkeeper of the Executive Council, and later a merchant, he died in 1806, survived by seven children, Robert junior being the eldest. Career By 1812, Wood was commissioned culler of timber, and by 1815 master culler and measurer of masts and timber. He and his brother George started their own business as timber merchants and carpenters; the business flourished and floundered on the vicissitudes of the timber market, and Wood was bankrupted in 1826, only to recover (building a large house at Anse St Michel, Sillery) by 1829. Death At some time around the end of 1846 or early 1847, Wood visited the West Indies to benefit his health; this failed to do any good, and he died in April of that year. He was survived by his wife, Charlotte (née Gray), daughter of a military clerk, whom he had married in 1817 and with whom he had eleven children.

In 1966, he graduated from Yale Law School, and then clerked for Justice Hugo Black of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1968 Term. On March 18, 2008, he unsuccessfully represented the District of Columbia before the United States Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller.

On March 5, 2010, the Washington Post published an op-ed by Dellinger defending Karl Thompson, a former subordinate of his. Nine lawyers who had been appointed to positions within the Presidency, including Thompson, became the focus of criticism, because they had all worked on behalf of Guantanamo captives. In the op-ed Delligner said that Thompson had added assisting Lieutenant Commander William Keubler in his defense of Omar Khadr at his request. He said Thompson had helped assist Keubler for several months, in addition to his previous duties. In 2010, North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue inducted Dellinger into the Order of the Long Leaf Pine, calling him \\"North Carolina’s best friend, legally, that we’ve ever had.\\"News & Observer: Perdue recognizes Dellinger In early 2012, with Dellinger representing the defendant in United States v.

The school was built to accommodate the children of United Nations (UN) employees and diplomats when the UN decided to locate one of its offices in Vienna (at the Vienna International Centre), and it remains affiliated to the UN. About 50% of students are children of UN employees and receive education grants, while much of the remaining students are children mainly of embassy staff and company staff. The school has an enrollment of 1700 students, from pre-primary to twelfth grade. History =International Community School= The first English language medium school in Vienna was set up in August 1955 as the International Community School. Previously, it had been the 'British Army School' in Schönbrunn barracks and catered for the children of the British occupying forces in Vienna. The Austrian State Treaty signed in May 1955 resulted in the occupying forces leaving Austria, so the school transformed into the International Community School under the patronage of the British, American and Indian Missions. It opened on 1 September 1955 in the 18th district of Vienna. By the end of the year, 150 students between the ages of 3 and 15 years attended the International Community School. Soon the building proved too small for the expanding school, which moved into the 19th district. By 1959, 300 children represented 25 different nationalities in ICS. However, most of the children were American or Canadian, so the British and Indian Embassies started a separate British style school in 1959, the English School, while the ICS changed into the American International School. =English School= The English School moved into Grinzinger Straße 95, a premises found with the help of the British Ambassador, Sir James Bowker, the legal advisor at the Embassy Walter Rhodes, and Vienna's Deputy Lord Mayor, Hans Mandl. The English School quickly expanded and was visited by the British Minister of Education in 1961. Some of the first staff of the International Atomic Energy Agency sent their children to the English School in 1959. The school year 1961-62 saw the introduction of William Kirk as director. In May 1969, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited the English School on a state visit to Vienna. In 1974, some families of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) started sending their children to the school. =Vienna International School= In September 1977, Maurice Pezet was invited by the Austrian Government to start the project of developing a Vienna International School on the model of the Geneva and New York United Nations Schools in preparation for the expansion of the United Nations to Vienna. {Vienna is one of the four headquarters of the UN, along with New York, Geneva and Nairobi. The Vienna International Centre (UNO City) is leased to the United Nations for 1 Austrian schilling (7 euro cent) per year.} It was anticipated that there would be two years of preparation for the small existing English School to be incorporated into the school development plan for the Vienna International School (VIS). The Vienna International School officially opened its doors on 11 September 1978 to pupils of 60 nationalities. Primary and Secondary were accommodated on Grinzingerstrasse and Kindergarten was located on Heiligenstädter Strasse. A part of Secondary moved briefly to Zollergasse and then Schloss Pötzleinsdorf. A year later, Secondary School moved to Peter-Jordan-Straße, where it remained until the custom built present campus was opened in September 1984 with Maurice Pezet as Director. The then Chancellor, Dr Bruno Kreisky had initiated the idea of a new, specially built school and the campus was entirely funded by the Austrian Government. Dr. Kreisky employed Maurice Pezet, formerly associated with the UN School in New York (UNIS), to manage the project and he became the first Director of the new Vienna International School. Dr. Kreisky was present at some of the opening events at the VIS. The new building was constructed in the 22nd District, two U-Bahn (underground) stops from the VIC, and opened in September 1984. It is located on Straße der Menschenrechte, two hundred metres away from the U1 Kagran underground station and the Donau Zentrum Shopping Mall.VIS School History Main entrance of Vienna International School Facilities The school is divided into 3 wings.

His social teachings became influential during the papacy of Leo XIII and his encyclical Rerum novarum. Early life and ordination Ketteler was born in Münster in Westphalia. In 1828 he finished the Matura in Brig, Switzerland far away from his home. He studied theology at Göttingen, Berlin, Heidelberg and Munich, and was ordained priest in 1844. He resolved to consecrate his life to maintaining the cause of the freedom of the Church from the control of the State. This brought him into collision with the civil power, an attitude which he maintained throughout a stormy and eventful life. Scholar and politician Ketteler was rather a man of action than a scholar, and he first distinguished himself as the deputy for District of Tecklenburg and Warendorf at the Frankfurt National Assembly, a position to which he was elected in 1848, and in which he soon became noted for his decision, foresight, energy and eloquence. Bishop In 1850 he was made bishop of Mainz, by order of the Vatican, in preference to the celebrated Professor Leopold Schmidt, of Gießen, whose Liberal sentiments were not agreeable to the Papal party. When elected, Ketteler refused to allow the students of theology in his diocese to attend lectures at Giessen, and ultimately founded an opposition seminary in the diocese of Mainz itself. Educator He also founded religious institutes of School Brothers and School Sisters, to work in the various educational agencies he had called into existence, and he labored to institute orphanages and rescue homes. In 1851, he founded the congregation of the Sisters of Divine Providence, with Stephanie Amelia Starkenfels de la Roche. Death and legacy He died at Burghausen, Upper Bavaria in 1877. In Mainz, \\"Workers' Day\\" is celebrated in honor of the Bishop. The Herz-Jesu-Kirche, Mainz was built in the honour of Ketteler. The fuchsia cultivar \\"Baron de Ketteler\\" is named after him. Ketteler's nephew, Klemens von Ketteler, was Germany's envoy in China and was murdered during the Boxer Rebellion. He is cited in Pope Benedict's encyclical Deus caritas est for his role in the Catholic social tradition. Views =Protestantism= In 1861, Ketteler published a book on reconciliation between Catholics and Protestants in Germany, Freiheit, Autorität, und Kirche; in it, he proposed the founding of a prayer society \\"for the Reunion of Christendom\\". Ketteler was friends with Julie von Massow, a Lutheran woman from Prussian nobility, who indeed founded such a prayer society. =Church rights= In 1858, Ketteler threw down the gauntlet against the State in his pamphlet on the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. In 1863 he adopted Ferdinand Lassalle's views and published his Die Arbeitfrage und das Christenthum. =Papal infallibility= When the question of papal infallibility arose, he opposed the promulgation of the dogma on the ground that such promulgation was inopportune. But after the dogma was defined, he submitted to the decrees (in August 1870). =Kulturkampf= He was the warmest opponent of the State in the Kulturkampf provoked by Prince Otto von Bismarck after the publication of the Vatican decrees, and was largely instrumental in compelling that statesman to retract the pledge he had rashly given, never to \\"go to Canossa.\\" =Battle of Sedan= To such an extent did Bishop von Ketteler carry his opposition, that in 1874 he forbade his clergy to take part in celebrating the anniversary of the Battle of Sedan, and declared the Rhine to be a \\"Catholic river.\\"  Notes  References *  External links  *A Catholic View of the Economy: Excerpt from Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler’s “The Labor Question and Christianity” (1864) Category:1811 births Category:1877 deaths Category:People from Münster Category:People from the Province of Westphalia Category:Barons of Germany Category:Bishops of Mainz (1802-present) Category:Centre Party (Germany) politicians Category:Members of the Frankfurt Parliament Category:Members of the First Chamber of the Estates of the Grand Duchy of Hesse Category:Members of the 1st Reichstag of the German Empire Category:19th-century German Catholic theologians Category:19th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:19th-century German male writers Category:Participants in the First Vatican Council Category:University of Göttingen alumni Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumni Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:German male non-fiction writers ","title":"Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler"},{"id":"2195286","text":"The Almighty were a hard rock/heavy metal band, from Glasgow in Scotland who formed in 1988. Three of the founding members, Ricky Warwick, Stump Monroe and Floyd London were friends who met at school. Although the band members musical roots were in punk, The Almighty adopted a more heavy metal/hard rock oriented musical direction in their early years. Later albums saw the band's musical style move towards the band members' original punk roots. They have released seven studio albums, two anthologies and one live album. History =1988–93= Blood, Fire and Love, the band's debut album, recorded and released in 1989The Almighty were formed in Strathaven, Scotland, on 19 January 1988. Most of the musicians came from a punk background. Lead singer Ricky Warwick had previously done some session and tour work with New Model Army, although not on any of their recordings. Ricky, drummer Stump Monroe and bass guitarist Floyd London were friends at school and had previously played together in a local band called Rough Charm. The three were joined by guitarist Andy 'Tantrum' McCafferty to complete the band line-up. Despite the band members largely punk rock roots, The Almighty followed a more heavy metal/hard rock oriented musical direction, and recorded an eight-track demo to help promote their early gigs. They were signed by Polydor in March 1989 and recorded their first album, Blood, Fire and Love which was released in October to generally positive reviews. The band were also signed to a long- term songwriting agreement to Chrysalis Music, having been scouted by Dave Massey. In the same year they were voted in third place on the Kerrang! readers poll for Best New Act. In 1990 they toured the UK and also embarked upon a short US tour in an attempt to break into the American market. However, a more extensive follow up tour of the US did not go ahead, although they did embark on a European club tour. The band's hard rock sound was compared favourably with the likes of The Cult, AC/DC and Motörhead in press reviews of their live shows. A live album, Blood, Fire and Live, was released on 8 October 1990, having been recorded at July gigs in Edinburgh and Nottingham. The track list featured songs from Blood, Fire and Love, plus a cover of Bachman–Turner Overdrive's \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\". Recording of The Almighty's second studio album, Soul Destruction, began in December 1990 with Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor as producer. The album was released in March 1991 along with the lead single \\"Free'n'Easy\\". In February and March the band toured the UK supporting Motörhead and Megadeth. In June 1991 they embarked on a headline UK tour. The concert at the Town and Country club in London was filmed and released later that year on VHS as Soul Destruction - Live. Later in the year they supported Alice Cooper on a European tour. In March 1992 internal differences within the band came to a head causing guitarist Tantrum to leave the band. He was replaced by Canadian Pete Friesen who had previously played for Alice Cooper, and had met The Almighty when they played support for him the previous year. In the spring the band were invited to tour Australia in support of The Screaming Jets, who had just released their Living in England EP and wanted a British band for the support on their tour. That summer the band were the opening act at the Donington Monsters of Rock festival, and during their set played a new song entitled \\"Addiction\\". Towards the end of the year they began preparing material for a third album. In April 1993 Powertrippin', their third album, was released, charting at Number 5. The album displayed Grunge influences, with Alice in Chains being a regular comparison in reviews. The Almighty embarked upon a European tour supporting Iron Maiden, their longest tour to date. This was followed with a support slot at that year's Milton Keynes Bowl festival, which substituted for Donington as the Monsters of Rock festival was not staged in 1993. In Autumn 93 they finally toured America, but failed to make the hoped-for impact. On their return they started a headline European tour, but had to abandon it after the first two London dates due to poor health. In November, The Almighty parted from manager Tommy Tee and moved to Sanctuary Records. At the same time they left Polydor and signed with Chrysalis. They were able to perform some replacement UK shows the same month, but were not able to tour Europe as planned. =1994–96= Their fourth album, Crank, was released on Chrysalis in late 1994. The album saw The Almighty's musical style shift towards the band members original punk roots. They appeared on Top of the Pops in support of the first single, \\"Wrench\\", which reached Number 26 in the UK singles chart. The second single from the album, \\"Jonestown Mind\\", also reached Number 26. In the autumn they toured the UK in support of the album and spent seven weeks in Europe supporting Pantera. The band returned to tour Europe as headliners in early 1995. In May they recorded four tracks for a proposed EP. However, the band decided that the tracks were good enough to form the basis for a fifth album. They therefore decided to arrange two more recording sessions during 1995, recording four tracks each time, so that they would have enough for an album release in 1996. Their fifth album, Just Add Life, was released in 1996, with the lead single \\"All Sussed Out\\" reaching Number 28 in the UK singles chart. However, various record company issues and frustrations with the music industry in general saw the band disband later that year. =2000–02= The band reformed in 2000 and released the self-titled album The Almighty, replacing guitarist Pete Friesen with Nick Parsons. A second album followed in 2001, Psycho-Narco, with a new bass player Gav Gray who replaced longtime bassist Floyd London. The band disbanded again with vocalist Ricky Warwick pursuing a solo career. In 2002 a compilation album, Wild and Wonderful was released, which included material from their three Polydor albums, along with covers of \\"Bodies\\", by the Sex Pistols, \\"You Ain't Seen Nuthin Yet\\" from Blood Fire and Live and \\"Keep on Rocking in the Free World\\" by Neil Young. =2006–present= The classic lineup (Ricky, Stump, Floyd and Pete) reformed for benefit shows in January 2006 and then appeared at the 2006 Bulldog Bash. They undertook a short five show tour at the end of December 2006. In 2007, the band released their second compilation album, Anth F***in'Ology - the Gospel According to The Almighty, covering their entire career and including a DVD of all their promo videos to date. A lengthier UK tour took place in January 2008 to mark the band's twentieth anniversary. It was announced on 17 January that the band would be recording footage with multiple cameras at various shows on the upcoming tour for a 20th Anniversary DVD. Ricky Warwick announced in an interview with Komodo Rock that there were plans to record a new album following the band's UK Tour. He said \\"I would like to. ... I'm inspired again though, and I feel to me it might be time to turn round and make that definitive Almighty Album.\\" In November 2008, Floyd announced on the band's forum and MySpace pages that he had decided to leave the band. The Almighty have been on hiatus since then, aside from a one-off benefit gig in June 2009 for the family of former manager Tommy Tee who had died in December 2008. It was announced in December 2014 that the band's first two studio albums, Blood, Fire & Love and Soul Destruction were to be re-released in early 2015 with additional tracks and live recordings.

It continued in use with the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies in the post-war period until replaced in 1954 by the RGD-5 grenade. Stockpiles were held for emergency or reserve issue, military aid, or foreign sales. They were eventually destroyed in the 1980s due to the TNT filling degrading and becoming unsafe. Unlike the RGD-33, the RG-42's components were simple to produce and assemble. Only the fuze required specialized manufacture and the parts could be easily assembled by hand by cottage labor. Partisans often made copies of the simple design when out of contact. It contained about 200 grams of explosive charge (TNT) in a cylindrical stamped-metal can. It used the 3.2 to 4 second UZRGM fuse, also used in the RGD-5, RG-41, and F1 grenades. The grenade could be thrown about 35–40 meters and has an effective blast radius of around 10 meters.

In classical antiquity, it was part of Arcadia. Bassae lies near the village of Skliros, northeast of Figaleia, south of Andritsaina and west of Megalopolis. It is famous for the well-preserved mid- to late-5th century BC Temple of Apollo Epicurius. Although this temple is geographically remote from major polities of ancient Greece, it is one of the most studied ancient Greek temples because of its multitude of unusual features. Bassae was the first Greek site to be inscribed on the World Heritage List (1986).Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae, World Heritage List. History of the Temple of Apollo Epicurius  The temple was dedicated to Apollo Epikourios (\\"Apollo the helper\\"). It sits at an elevation of 1,131 metres above sea level on the slopes of Kotylion Mountain. Its construction is placed between 450 BC and 400 BC. It was supposedly designed by Iktinos,The attribution was noted by Pausanias, 8.41.7ff. architect at Athens of the Parthenon. The ancient writer Pausanias praises the temple as eclipsing all others but the Temple of Athena Alea at Tegea by the beauty of its stone and the harmony of its construction.Pausanias, 8.41.7 ff. Pausanias described it in the 2nd century: :Phigalia is surrounded by mountains, on the left by the mountain called Kotilios . . . The distance from the city to Mount Kotilios is about forty stades. On the mountain is a place called Bassai, and the temple of Apollon Epikourios (the Helper), which, including the roof, is of stone. Of the temples in the Peloponnesos, this might be placed first after the one at Tegea for the beauty of its stone and for its symmetry. Apollon received his name from the help he gave in time of plague, just as the Athenians gave him the name of Alexikakos (Averter of Evil) for turning the plague away from them. It was at the time of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians that he also saved the Phigalians, and at no other time; the evidence is that of the two surnames of Apollon, which have practically the same meaning, and also the fact that Iktinos, the architect of the temple at Phigalia, was a contemporary of Perikles, and built for the Athenians what is called the Parthenon. My narrative has already said that the tile image of Apollon is in the market-place of Megalopolis.Pausanias, Description of Greece 8. 41. 7 - 9 It was in use until the 4th- or 5th-century AD, when all pagan temples were forcibly closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. Floor plan of the Temple of Apollo 1 = Opisthodomos, 2 = Adyton, 3 = Naos, 4 = Pronaos =Construction and decoration= The temple is aligned north-south, in contrast to the majority of Greek temples which are aligned east-west; its principal entrance is from the north. This was necessitated by the limited space available on the steep slopes of the mountain. To overcome this restriction a door was placed in the side of the temple, perhaps to let light in to illuminate the cult statue. The temple is of a relatively modest size, with the stylobate measuring 38.3 by 14.5 metresTemple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae , World Heritage Site. containing a Doric peristyle of six by fifteen columns (hexastyle). The roof left a central space open to admit light and air. The temple was constructed entirely out of grey Arcadian limestoneTakis Theodoropoulos, \\"The temple of Apollo the Helper - Heritage\\", UNESCO Courier, January 1996. except for the Bassae Frieze which was carved from marble (probably in ancient times colored with paint). Like most major temples it has three \\"rooms\\" or porches: the pronaos, plus a naos and an opisthodomos. The naos may have housed a cult statue of Apollo, although it is also surmised that the single 'proto- Corinthian' capital discovered by Charles Robert Cockerell and subsequently lost at sea, may have topped the single column that stood in the centre of the naos, and have been intended as an aniconic representation of Apollo Borealis. The temple lacks some optical refinements found in the Parthenon, such as a subtly curved floor, though the columns have entasis.Dinsmoore 1933:207 metope, depicting an Amazon, displayed at the British Museum The temple is unusual in that it has examples of all three of the classical orders used in ancient Greek architecture: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Hellenic Ministry of Culture: The Temple of Epicurean Apollo . Doric columns form the peristyle while Ionic columns support the interior and a single Corinthian column features in the centre of the interior. The Corinthian capital is the earliest example of the order found to date. It was relatively sparsely decorated on the exterior.William Dinsmoor made a detailed case for recognising former pedimental sculptures from Bassae, looted by Romans, in three pedimental figures of Niobids discovered at various times in the later nineteenth century on the site of the Gardens of Sallust, Rome (Dinsmoor, \\"The Lost Pedimental Sculptures of Bassae\\" American Journal of Archaeology 43.1 (January-March 1939:27-47). Inside, however, there was a continuous Ionic frieze showing Athenians in battle with Amazons and the Lapiths engaged in battle with Centaurs. This frieze's metopes were removed by Cockerell and taken to the British Museum in 1815 (they are still to be seen in the British Museum's Gallery 16, near the Elgin MarblesBassae Sculpture, British Museum.). Cockerell decorated the walls of the Ashmolean Museum's Great Staircase and that of the Travellers Club with plaster casts of the same frieze.Beazley Archive =Re-discovery and removal by the British= The Bassae Frieze has its own room at the British Museum. Foot fragment of a colossal statue at Bassae, displayed at the British Museum The temple had been noticed first in November 1765 by the French architect J. Bocher, who was building villas at Zante and came upon it quite by accident; he recognized it from its site, but when he returned for a second look, he was murdered by bandits.William Bell Dinsmoor, \\"The Temple of Apollo at Bassae\\" Metropolitan Museum Studies 4.2 (March 1933:204-227) p 204, notes Bocher's drawings, acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1914. Charles Robert Cockerell and Carl Haller von Hallerstein, having secured sculptures at Aegina, hoped for more successes at Bassae in 1811; all Haller's careful drawings of the site were lost at sea, however.Dinsmoor 1933:205. The site was explored in 1812 with the permission of Veli Pasha, the Turkish commander of the Peloponnese, by a group of British antiquaries who removed 23 slabs from the Ionic cella frieze and transported them to Zante along with other sculptures. Veli Pasha's claims on the finds were silenced in exchange for a small bribe, and the frieze was bought at auction by the British Museum in 1815. This frieze's metopes were removed personally by Cockerell. The frieze sculptures were published in Rome in 1814 and officially, by the British Museum in 1820. Other hasty visits resulted in further publications. The first fully published excavation was not begun until 1836; it was carried out by Russian archaeologists, among which the painter Karl Bryullov. Perhaps the most striking discovery was the oldest Corinthian capital found to date. Some of the recovered artefacts are on display at the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow. In 1902, a systematic excavation of the area was carried out by the Greek Archaeological Society of Athens under archaeologist Konstantinos Kourouniotis along with Konstantinos Romaios and Panagiotis Kavvadias. Further excavations were carried out in 1959, 1970 and from 1975–1979, under the direction of Nikolaos Gialouris. =Preservation= The temple's remoteness— Pausanias is the only ancient traveller whose remarks on Bassae have survived— has worked to its advantage for its preservation. Other, more accessible temples were damaged or destroyed by war or preserved only by conversion to Christian uses; the Temple of Apollo escaped both these fates. Due to its distance from major metropolitan areas it also has less of a problem with acid rain which quickly dissolves limestone and damages marble carvings. The temple of Apollo is presently covered in a white tent in order to protect the ruins from the elements. Conservation work is currently being carried out under the supervision of the Committee for the Conservation of the Temple of Apollo Epikourios of the Greek Ministry of Culture, which is based in Athens.

It dwells under rocks in limestone forest areas of the Korean peninsula. It was discovered by Stephen J. Karsen, an American science teacher working in Daejeon, South Korea, in 2003, and described in 2005. Although plethodontid salamanders comprise seventy percent of salamander species worldwide, Karsenia koreana is the first member of this taxon known from Asia. Like other plethodontids, it lacks lungs and breathes through its moist skin. It is the only species in the genus Karsenia. Systematics and biogeography Cladistic analysis using Bayesian analysis of molecular data places Karsenia koreana as sister group to the clade containing Aneides and the desmognathine salamanders. This implies that plethodontid salamanders may have had a worldwide range 60 to 100 million years ago. As the global climate cooled, New World taxa thrived while Old World populations declined. Other plants and animals currently found in Asia and North America share close relationships, showing a similar pattern of biogeography. Description Males measure and females in snout–vent length. The habitus is moderately robust. The head is relatively broad. The eyes are small and moderately protuberant. There are 14–15 costal grooves. The tail is round basally but becomes in some individuals laterally compressed towards its tip. Complete tail (i.e., non- regenerated) is about as long as the snout–vent length. The species is darkly pigmented. There is a broad dorsal stripe of variable color (reddish to yellowish brown, tan, or dark brown) and distinctness (prominent and bright to obscure). The lateral surfaces are uniformly dark but have an obscure overlay of small, whitish speckles. The ventral surfaces are pale with moderately large, whitish flecks that are absent along the midline. Habitat and conservation The species occurs in damp talus slopes and rockslides of limestone in young forests dominated by Pinus densiflora and Quercus mongolica, mostly under small stones. Although the species is considered locally common, and reasonably widespread (as of 2006, it was known from more than 20 sites), it has not been well studied in the field. Thus, its natural history, population dynamics, and reproductive behavior remain unknown.

The son of farmers, he was educated at Ruzawi School and then Falcon College where he captained the school cricket XI and played both hockey and rugby union.Ward J (2000) Guy Whittall - a short biography, CricInfo, 2000-11-10. Retrieved 2019-08-11. He was selected for the national schools cricket side aged 16 and toured New Zealand and England. The side was coached by former international David Houghton and they were unbeaten on both tours. His first Logan Cup century came for Zimbabwe Schools against Harare Central, although the tournament did not have first class status at the time. Whittall also played rugby for Zimbabwe schools, playing as a centre. He went on to play for the national side, including going as a squad member to the qualification tournament for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Cricket career His first-class cricket debut came at the age of 18, playing for Young Zimbabwe. He first played for Zimbabwe against Worcestershire, opening the batting and was selected for the Zimbabwean team to tour England in 1993. Although he would not get a game in England, he was included in the side for the tour to Pakistan later the same year. Whittall made his Test debut in December against Pakistan, scoring 33 runs and taking the wicket of Basit Ali. He made his maiden Test century in his sixth Test, at Harare Sports Club in February 1995, making an unbeaten 113 to help his side to a historic first Test victory against the touring Pakistanis. Two years later he scored Zimbabwe's first double-century, making an unbeaten 203 at Queens Sports Club against New Zealand. Whittall was well short of his double ton when the number 11, Everton Matambanadzo, came in to bat. The New Zealanders did their bit to help, giving field placings designed to give easy singles thus giving Matambanadzo the strike. The milestone eventually came with a boundary through the slips. Against the same opponents in September 2002, Whittall fell just short of registering another double hundred, finishing unbeaten on 188 in controversial circumstances when Pommie Mbangwa was run out with Whittall possibly impeded by Dion Nash. Although he never took a five wicket haul, Whittall took over 50 Test wickets for Zimbabwe. His career best was 4/18 against England. His ODI career included three World Cups, and he did particularly well in 1999 as Zimbabwe made the final six. In 2000, he became the first fielder for Zimbabwe to take four catches in an innings of an ODI  References  External links * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Falcon College Category:Manicaland cricketers Category:Matabeleland cricketers Category:Zimbabwean ODI captains Category:Zimbabwe One Day International cricketers Category:Zimbabwe Test cricketers Category:Zimbabwean cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 1996 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 1999 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 2003 Cricket World Cup Category:White Rhodesian people ","title":"Guy Whittall"},{"id":"2195326","text":"In the United States and Canada, an attending physician (also known as an attending, rendering doc, or staff physician) is a physician (M.D. or D.O.) who has completed residency and practices medicine in a clinic or hospital, in the specialty learned during residency. An attending physician typically supervises fellows, residents, medical students, and other practitioners. Attending physicians may also maintain professorships at an affiliated medical school. This is common if the supervision of trainees is a significant part of the physician's work. Attending physicians have final responsibility, legally and otherwise, for patient care, even when many of the minute-to-minute decisions are being made by house officers (residents) or Advanced Practice Providers (i.e. physician assistants and nurse practitioners). Attending physicians are sometimes the 'rendering physician' listed on the patient's official medical record, but if they are overseeing a resident or another staff member, they are 'supervising.' Attending physicians may also still be in training, such as a fellow in a subspecialty. For example, a cardiology fellow may function as an internal medicine attending, as he or she has already finished residency in internal medicine. The term is used more commonly in teaching hospitals. In non-teaching hospitals, essentially all physicians function as attendings in some respects after completing residency. The term \\"attending physician\\" or \\"attending\\" also refers to the formal relationship of a hospitalized patient and their primary medic during the hospitalization, as opposed to ancillary physicians assisting the primary care physician. However, even on a consultation service, at an academic center, the physician who has finished his or her training is called the attending or consultant, as opposed to a resident physician.

Professional career = TV Host and author = After hosting the 26-part PBS television series Cooking Mexican in 1978–1979, Bayless dedicated over six years to culinary research in Mexico, culminating in 1987 with the publication of his Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico, which Craig Claiborne described as \\"the greatest contribution to the Mexican table imaginable.\\" Following Authentic Mexican, Bayless has written a number of highly regarded cookbooks (see §Awards and accolades), often co-authoring with Deann and his daughter, Lanie. Perhaps his best-known cookbook is his 2001 James Beard Foundation award-winning Mexico: One Plate at a Time, a companion to the first season of Bayless' PBS television show of the same name. At least one other of his cookbooks, Mexican Everyday (2005), provides recipes that directly tie into the show. In 2003, PBS began broadcasting Bayless' television series, Mexico: One Plate at a Time. Bayless and the show have been nominated for several Daytime Emmy Awards over the years. Bayless was personally nominated twice for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lifestyle/Culinary Host for his work on the show, in 2012, and again in 2017. One Plate at a Time's director, Scott Dummler, was nominated for Outstanding Directing in a Lifestyle/Culinary Program in 2012, and the show was nominated overall for Outstanding Culinary Program in 2016. Seasons of Mexico: One Plate at a Time sometimes focus on the cuisine of a specific region: for example, season 8 was centered around cuisine from Tijuana and the Baja Peninsula, season 9 focused on Oaxaca, and season 11 was produced entirely on the Yucatán Peninsula. = Chef and restaurateur = Before opening his own restaurant, Bayless began his career as a professional chef in 1980 as the executive chef at Lopez y Gonzalez, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. In 1987 Bayless and his wife Deann opened Frontera Grill in Chicago, specializing in contemporary regional Mexican cuisine, with special emphasis on the varied cuisines of the Oaxaca region. In 1989 Rick and Deann opened Topolobampo, one of Chicago's first fine-dining Mexican restaurants. As of 2019, Topolobampo has 1 Michelin star. In 1995, Rick and partners started the Frontera Foods line of prepared food products. They sold Frontera Foods to ConAgra Foods in 2016. Bayless remains involved as a product-development advisor to the brand. The Frontera restaurants were not included in the deal. He was one of the founding members of Chefs Collaborative, in support of environmentally sound agricultural practices and is active in Share Our Strength, the nation's largest hunger advocacy organization. Often his TV shows emphasize responsible use of foodstuffs with focus on sustainable farming and cooking. Rick Bayless is a restaurant consultant and teaches authentic Mexican cooking throughout the United States. He is a visiting staff member at the Culinary Institute of America and leads cooking and cultural tours to Mexico. Fluent in Spanish, Bayless favors coastal (seafood) fare, and dishes that feature very traditional Mexican and pre-Columbian Incan, Mayan and Aztecan ingredients native to Mexico like chocolate, peppers, and vanilla bean. Bayless and his staff also began the Frontera Farmer Foundation in 2003. This foundation was set up to support Chicago-area local farmers by offering capital improvement grants. , more than $400,000 has been given to local family farms. In December 2007, Bayless opened Frontera Fresco restaurant inside Macy's Union Square store in San Francisco. He later opened Frontera Fresco restaurants inside Macy's State Street store in Chicago, Macy's in nearby Skokie, on the campus of Northwestern University and in Walt Disney World. The San Francisco restaurant closed in April 2014. The Northwestern outlet closed in June 2018 at the end of the school year. In 2008, Bayless was widely considered to be a serious contender for the position of White House Executive Chef under the administration of Barack Obama. In 2010, after having spent significant time at local Mexican dining spots, Bayless made his Los Angeles debut running the kitchen at the Red O. Bayless was guest chef for the May 19, 2010, White House state dinner honoring Mexican President Felipe Calderón and his wife Margarita Zavala. = Other media appearances = In 2005, Bayless competed on Iron Chef America and lost by one point to Iron Chef Bobby Flay on what was the first broadcast episode of season 1, with American bison meat as the secret ingredient. Bayless appeared as a guest judge in episode 3 of Season 4's Top Chef, judging both the quickfire and elimination challenges. He later went on to become a contestant in episode 3 of the first season of Top Chef Masters, winning that episode and advancing to the Champion's round. In the championship round he won the title of Top Chef Master on August 19, 2009. In 2012, Bayless ventured into the world of theatre, partnering with Lookingglass Theatre Company in Chicago to put on the play Rick Bayless in Cascabel, which Bayless created along with Tony Hernandez and Heidi Stillman. The show opened on March 21, 2012 to favorable reviews and ran through April 29. Rick Bayless' name was again brought up on air during the First Take segment where his brother, Skip Bayless, spoke of him as a self-made man who never worked for another boss.

The Flatirons are rock formations in the western United States, near Boulder, Colorado, consisting of flatirons. There are five large, numbered Flatirons ranging from north to south (First through Fifth, respectively) along the east slope of Green Mountain (elev. ), and the term \\"The Flatirons\\" sometimes refers to these five alone. Numerous additional named Flatirons are on the southern part of Green Mountain, Bear Peak, and among the surrounding foothills. Etymology The Flatirons were known as the \\"Chautauqua Slabs\\" c. 1900 and \\"The Crags\\" c. 1906. There are two hypotheses regarding the origin of the current name, one based on resemblance to old-fashioned clothes irons, the other based on resemblance to the Flatiron Building completed in 1902. Geology Fairview High School in southern Boulder Morning view of Flatirons from Broomfield, Colorado The Flatirons consist of conglomeratic sandstone of the Fountain Formation. Geologists estimate the age of these rocks as 290 to 296 million years; they were lifted and tilted into their present orientation between 35 and 80 million years ago, during the Laramide Orogeny. The Flatirons were subsequently exposed by erosion. Other manifestations of the Fountain Formation can be found in many places along the Colorado Front Range, including Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs, Roxborough State Park in Douglas County, and Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Morrison. Climbing The Flatirons on Green Mountain are within the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks system. They are popular destinations for hikers and rock climbers, with rock grades ranging from easy (5.0) to world-class (5.14b). Of note is the East Face Standard route on the Third Flatiron; guidebook author and longtime climber Richard Rossiter calls it \\"The best 5.4 in the solar system.\\"https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105748047/east-face-standard A symbol of Boulder Images of the numbered Flatirons on Green Mountain are ubiquitous symbols of the city of Boulder. The area abounds with Flatirons photographs, drawings, paintings, and sculptures. The city government, the University of Colorado, and many businesses make use of this symbol in their logos, advertisements, and marketing materials. Many businesses also use the word Flatirons or Flatiron in their names. In addition, Boulder often is referred to in the tech industry as the \\"Silicon Flatirons\\", analogous to Santa Clara Valley's famous nickname. The third Flatiron bore a \\"CU,\\" for the University of Colorado, in white letters from the 1950s until 1980, when the city painted over the initials to restore the natural look of the stone formation. CU students Dale Johnson and Robert Rowlands climbed the flatiron one night in November 1949 to paint the original \\"C.\\" The \\"C\\" was removed and painted again, with a \\"U\\" being added in the 1950s. The letters are still faintly visible under the reddish paint used by the city in 1980.

It encompasses engineering which focuses on fire detection, suppression and mitigation and fire safety engineering which focuses on human behavior and maintaining a tenable environment for evacuation from a fire. In the United States 'fire protection engineering' is often used to include 'fire safety engineering'. The discipline of fire engineering includes, but is not exclusive to: * Fire detection - fire alarm systems and brigade call systems * Active fire protection - fire suppression systems * Passive fire protection - fire and smoke barriers, space separation * Smoke control and management * Escape facilities - emergency exits, fire lifts, etc. * Building design, layout, and space planning * Fire prevention programs * Fire dynamics and fire modeling * Human behavior during fire events * Risk analysis, including economic factors * Wildfire management Fire protection engineers identify risks and design safeguards that aid in preventing, controlling, and mitigating the effects of fires. Fire engineers assist architects, building owners and developers in evaluating buildings' life safety and property protection goals. Fire engineers are also employed as fire investigators, including such very large- scale cases as the analysis of the collapse of the World Trade Center. NASA uses fire engineers in its space program to help improve safety. Fire engineers are also employed to provide 3rd party review for performance based fire engineering solutions submitted in support of local building regulation applications. History Fire engineering's roots date back to Ancient Rome, when the Emperor Nero ordered the city to be rebuilt utilizing passive fire protection methods, such as space separation and non-combustible building materials, after a catastrophic fire. The discipline of fire engineering emerged in the early 20th century as a distinct discipline, separate from civil, mechanical and chemical engineering, in response to new fire problems posed by the Industrial Revolution. Fire protection engineers of this era concerned themselves with devising methods to protect large factories, particularly spinning mills and other manufacturing properties. Another motivation to organize the discipline, define practices and conduct research to support innovations was in response to the catastrophic conflagrations and mass urban fires that swept many major cities during the latter half of the 19th century (see city or area fires). The insurance industry also helped promote advancements in the fire engineering profession and the development of fire protection systems and equipment. In 1903 the first degree program in fire protection engineering was initiated as the Armour Institute of Technology (later becoming part of the Illinois Institute of Technology). As the 20th century emerged, several catastrophic fires resulted in changes to buildings codes to better protect people and property from fire. It was only in the latter half of the 20th Century that fire protection engineering emerged as a unique engineering profession. The primary reason for this emergence was the development of the “body of knowledge,” specific to the profession that occurred after 1950. Other factors contributing to the growth of the profession include the start of the Institution of Fire Engineers in 1918 in the UK, and the Society of Fire Protection Engineers in 1950 in the US, the emergence of independent fire protection consulting engineer, and the promulgation of engineering standards for fire protection.  Education  Fire engineers, like their counterparts in other engineering and scientific disciplines, undertake a formal course of education and continuing professional development to acquire and maintain their competence. This education typically includes foundation studies in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and technical writing. Professional engineering studies focus students on acquiring proficiency in material science, statics, dynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, engineering economics, ethics, Systems in engineering, reliability, and environmental psychology. Studies in combustion, probabilistic risk assessment or risk management, the design of fire suppression systems, fire alarm systems, building fire safety, and the application and interpretation of model building codes, and the measurement and simulation of fire phenomena complete most curricula. New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to introduce performance based assessment methods into their building codes in regard to fire safety. This occurred with the introduction of their 1991 Building Act. Professor Andy Buchanan, of the University of Canterbury, established the first post graduate and only course available in New Zealand, at the time, in fire safety engineering in 1995. Applicants to the course require a minimum qualification of a bachelor's degree in engineering or bachelor's degree in a limited list of science course. Notable alumni from the university of Canterbury include Sir Ernest Rutherford, Robert (Bob) Park, Roy Kerr, Michael P. Collins, and John Britten. A master's degree in fire engineering from the University of Canterbury is recognized under the Washington Accord. In the United States, the University of Maryland (UMD) offers the ABET-accredited B.S. degree program in Fire Protection Engineering, as well as graduate degrees and a distance M.Eng. program. Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) offers an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Fire Protection Engineering as well as online graduate programs in this discipline (M.S. and a Graduate Certificate). , Cal Polycalpoly.edu offers an M.S. in Fire Protection Engineering. Oklahoma State University offers an ABET- accredited B.S. in Fire Protection and Safety Engineering Technology (established in 1937), Eastern Kentucky University also offers an ABET- accredited B.S. in Fire Protection and Safety Engineering Technology, the Case School of Engineering at Case Western Reserve University offers a master's degree track in Fire Science and Engineering, University of New Haven offers a B.S. in Fire Protection Engineering. and the University of Cincinnati offers an associate degree in Fire Science and a bachelor's degree in Fire and Safety Engineering Technology as distance learning options, the only university in the U.S. and Canada to hold this distinction. Other institutions, such as the University of Kansas, Illinois Institute of Technology, University of California, Berkeley, University of California, San Diego, Eastern Kentucky University, and the University of Texas at Austin have or do offer courses in Fire Protection Engineering or technology. Canada has fire engineering programs at York University and the University of Waterloo. The practice of final fire sprinkler systems design and hydraulic calculations is commonly performed by design technicians who are often educated in-house at contracting firms throughout North America, with the objective of preparing designers for certification by testing by associations such as NICET (National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies). NICET certification is commonly used as a proof of competency for securing a license to design and install fire protection systems. In Europe, the University of Edinburgh offers a degree in Fire Engineering and had its first fire research group in the 1970s. These activities are now conducted at the new BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering. The University of Leeds uniquely offers an MSc award in Fire and Explosion Engineering. Other European Universities active in fire engineering are: * Bergische Universität Wuppertal * Ghent University * Imperial College London * Letterkenny Institute of Technology * Linnaeus University * Luleå University of Technology * London South Bank University * Lund University * Norwegian University of Science * Otto-von-Guericke-Universität Magdeburg * Stord/Haugesund University College * University of Applied Sciences Cologne * University of Cantabria * University of Central Lancashire * University of Greenwich * University of Manchester * University of Poitiers * University of Sheffield * University of Ulster * University of Wales (Newport) * University of Warwick * Glasgow Caledonian University * Vilnius Gediminas Technikal University The University of Ulster introduced its first fire safety programmes in 1975, followed by the first MSc Programme in Fire Safety Engineering in the United Kingdom introduced in 1990. In 2005 this MSc Programme will celebrate 25 years of unbroken service to higher fire safety engineering education. In 2004 the Institute for Fire Safety Engineering and Technology at the University of Ulster FireSERT occupied its new fire safety engineering laboratories which were funded by £6 million pound Infrastructure Award. The new facilities are state of the art fire safety engineering laboratories including a large scale burn hall and a 10 megawatt calorimeter. In Australia, Victoria University in Melbourne offers postgraduate courses in Building Fire Safety and Risk Engineering as does the University of Western Sydney. The Centre for Environmental Safety and Risk Engineering (CESARE) is a research unit under Victoria University and has facilities for research and testing of fire behaviour. The Charles Darwin University and the University of Queensland have active programs. Asian universities active in fire engineering include: Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Tokyo University of Science, Toyohashi University of Technology, and the University of Science and Technology of China. Professional registration Suitably qualified and experienced fire protection engineers may qualify for registration as a professional engineer. The recognition of fire protection engineering as a separate discipline varies from state to state in the United States. NCEES recognizes Fire Protection Engineering as a separate discipline and offers a PE exam subject.NCEES This test was last updated for the October 2012 exam and includes the following major topics (percentages indicate approximate weight of topic): * Fire Protection Analysis (20%) * Fire Protection Management (5%) * Fire Dynamics (12.5%) * Active and Passive Systems (50%) * Egress and Occupant Movement (12.5%) Few countries outside the United States regulate the professional practice of fire protection engineering as a discipline, although they may restrict the use of the title 'engineer' in association with its practice. The titles 'fire engineer' and 'fire safety engineer' tend to be preferred outside the United States, especially in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries influenced by the British fire service. The Institution of Fire Engineers is one international organization that qualifies many aspects of the training and qualifications of fire engineers and has the power to offer chartered status.

It is a pattern from which many subsequent tarot decks derive. Origins left Michael Dummett's research led him to conclude that (based on the lack of earlier documentary evidence) the Tarot deck was probably invented in northern Italy in the 15th century and introduced into southern France when the French conquered Milan and the Piedmont in 1499. The antecedents of the Tarot de Marseille would then have been introduced into southern France at around that time. The 78-card version of the game of Tarot died out in Italy but survived in France and Switzerland. When the game was reintroduced into northern Italy, the Marseilles designs of the cards were reintroduced with it. All Italian-suited tarot decks outside of Italy are descended from the Milan-Marseilles type with the exception of some early French and Belgian packs which show mixed influence from Bolognese tarot (see below). The earliest surviving cards of the Marseilles pattern were produced by Jean Noblet of Paris around 1650. The documentary \\"Les mystères du Tarot de Marseille\\" (Arte, 18 February 2015) claims that the work of Marsilio Ficino can be credited as having inspired imagery specific to the Marseilles. Etymology and English translation The name Tarot de Marseille is not of particularly ancient vintage; it was coined as late as 1856 by the French card historian Romain Merlin, and was popularized by French cartomancers Eliphas Levi, Gérard Encausse, and Paul Marteau who used this collective name to refer to a variety of closely related designs that were being made in the city of Marseilles in the south of France, a city that was a centre of playing card manufacture, and were (in earlier, contemporaneous, and later times) also made in other cities in France. The Tarot de Marseille is one of the standards from which many tarot decks of the 19th century and later are derived. The term Tarot de Marseille has, in the past, most often been translated into English as Tarot of Marseilles because of the English exonym Marseilles for the city whose name in French is spelled \\"Marseille\\". The spelling Marseille is gradually enjoying greater, concurrent usage in the English language to describe the city generally; likewise, the alternative English translation Tarot of Marseille for the French term Tarot de Marseille is gradually increasing in usage. Others have also tended to use the initials TdM, allowing for ambiguity as to whether the M stands for Marseille or Milan, a region claimed for the origins of the image design. In deference to the common appellation Marseille for the style and in recognition that the deck appears in other places, the term \\"Marseille-style\\" is at times also used. Structure Traditional North Italian playing cards, like the Tarot of Marseilles, distinguish batons from swords by the use of straight versus curved lines. Like other Tarot decks, the Tarot de Marseille contains fifty- six cards in the four standard suits. In French-language versions of the Tarot de Marseille, those suits are identified by their French names of Bâtons (Batons), Épées (Swords), Coupes (Cups), and Deniers (Coins). These count from Ace to 10. There was also an archaic practice of ranking the cards 10 to Ace for the suit of cups and coins in line with all other tarot games outside of Sicily. As well, there are four face cards in each suit: a Valet (Knave or Page), Chevalier or Cavalier (Horse-rider or Knight), Dame (Queen) and Roi (King). Occultists (and many tarot readers nowadays, whether English- or French-speaking) call this series the Minor Arcana (or Arcanes Mineures, in French). The court cards are sometimes called Les Honneurs (The Honors) or Les Lames Mineures de Figures (The Minor Figure Cards) in French, and the \\"Royal Arcana\\" in English. For the Valet de Bâtons (French > \\"Page of Batons\\"), the title of that card generally appears on the side of the card, while in some old versions of the Tarot de Marseille that card, along with either some or all others, is left unnamed. In the Tarot de Marseille, as is standard among Italian suited playing cards, the pip cards in the suit of swords are drawn as abstract symbols in curved lines, forming a shape reminiscent of a mandorla. On the even numbered cards, the abstract curved lines are all that is present. On the odd numbered cards, a single fully rendered sword is rendered inside the abstract designs. The suit of batons is drawn as straight objects that cross to form a lattice in the higher numbers; on odd numbered baton cards, a single vertical baton runs through the middle of the lattice. On the tens of both swords and batons, two fully rendered objects appear imposed on the abstract designs.Sedillot, below, pl. 1-4. The straight lined batons and the curved swords continue the tradition of Mamluk playing cards, in which the swords represented scimitars and the batons polo mallets.Huson In this abstraction, the Tarot, and the Italian playing cards tradition, diverges from that of Spanish playing cards, in which swords and batons are drawn as distinct objects. Cups and coins are drawn as distinct objects. Most decks fill up blank areas of the cards with floral decorations. The two of cups typically contains a floral caduceus-like symbol terminating in two heraldic dolphin heads. The two of coins usually joins the two coins by a ribbon motif; the ribbon is a conventional place for the manufacturer to include his name and the date.Sedillot, op. cit., plates 1-2. There is also a suit of twenty- two atouts (trump cards). The Fool, which is unnumbered in the Tarot de Marseille, is viewed as separate and additional to the other twenty-one numbered trumps because it usually cannot win a trick. Occultists (and many tarotists nowadays) call these twenty-two cards Les Lames Majeures de Figures (The Major Figure Cards) or Arcanes Majeures (major arcana) in French. The labelling of cards is a practice of French origin, Italians remembered their names by heart. The XIII card is generally left unlabelled in the various old and modern versions of the Tarot de Marseille, but it is worth noting that in Noblet's deck (circa 1650), the card was named LAMORT (Death). In at least some printings of the French/English bilingual version of Grimaud's pack, the XIII card is named \\"La Mort\\" in French and named \\"Death\\" in English. In many modern cartomantic tarot decks (e.g., Rider-Waite-Smith), the XIII card is named Death. The names given to the Marseilles pattern trumps differ from those in early Italian sources. The French la Force (Strength) is in Italian la Fortezza (Fortitude) for the cardinal virtue of Courage. L'Amoureux (the Lover) is in Italy l'Amore (Love). Le Jugement (the Judgement) is l'Angelo (the Angel) or le Trombe (the Trumpets). L'Ermite (the Hermit) is given either as il Gobbo (the Hunchback), il Vecchio (the Old Man), or as il Tempo (Time). Le Pendu (the Hanged Man) is il Traditore (the Traitor). La Torre/la Maison Dieu (the Tower/the House of God) is given either as la Sagitta (the arrow), la Saetta (Lightning), la Casa del Diavolo (the House of the Devil), la Casa del Dannato (the House of the Damned), il Fouco (the Fire), or as l'inferno (Hell). The ranking of the trumps vary according to region or time period. The following trump images are from Jean Dodal's deck printed in Lyon in the early 18th century. Like most other tarot decks, it uses additive Roman numerals, hence \\"IIII\\" instead of \\"IV\\". Image:Jean Dodal Tarot trump 01.jpgI.

There is no solid historical evidence of a female pope, but this card may be based around the mythical Pope Joan. One variant of the Tarot de Marseille, now called the Tarot of Besançon, removes the controversial Popess and Pope and, in their stead, puts Juno with her peacock, and Jupiter with his eagle.Tarot de Besançon at the International Playing-Card Society. Retrieved 3 March 2017. Developed in Alsace at the beginning of the 18th century, this deck was popular among Catholics living in regions that bordered Protestant communities. Protestants, and Catholics living outside contentious zones, preferred using the Marseilles pattern. During the French Revolution, the Emperor and Empress cards became the subject of similar controversies and were displaced by Grandfather and Grandmother. It arrived in Besançon only at the beginning of the 19th century where mass- production caused the current association of this deck to that city. An updated variant of the Besançon pattern is the Swiss 1JJ Tarot which is still in use by Troccas and Troggu players.Swiss Tarot at the International Playing- Card Society. Retrieved 3 March 2017. =Piedmontese and Lombard patterns= Le Fol - Il Matto. Two different versions of The Fool, from the Vergnano Tarot printed in Turin (northern Italy) by Stefano Vergnano: 1827 (left) and around 1830 (right). In the early eighteenth century the Marseilles Tarot was introduced in Northern Italy starting from the Kingdom of Sardinia, which also included the Savoy (now in France) and Piedmont, where the card manufacturing industry collapsed following a severe economic depression. The Piedmontese players did not have difficulties to accept the Marseilles Tarot, because the images were similar and even the French language captioning was widespread in many areas of Piedmont. Around 1820 some manufacturers active in Turin, capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia, began to produce Tarot decks in Marseille's pattern, but after few years they introduced captions in Italian and small variations in certain figures. For example, the Fool was not chased by a wild animal but had a butterfly in front of him. In a few decades, variation after variation, was consolidated the iconography of the Piedmontese Tarot, which therefore must be considered as a derivation of the Tarot of Marseilles.See. Giordano Berti, Old Italian Tarot. 78 cards engraved by Stefano Vergnano, Turin, 1830 ca. Booklet attached to \\"Vergnano Tarot 1830\\", Araba Fenice, Boves 2014. It is currently the most widely used tarot deck in Italy. In the Austrian-ruled Duchy of Milan (modern-day Lombardy), the Marseilles pattern also took root with Italian captioning starting around 1810. The \\"Death\\" card was given several names by different manufacturers such as il Tredici (Thirteen), lo Specchio (the Skeleton), and Uguaglianza (Equality). Production of this pattern stopped before the First World War. Around 1835, Carlo Della Rocca of Milan engraved an elaborate interpretation of the Marseilles pattern.Tarocchino Milanese at the International Playing- Card Society. Retrieved 5 March 2017. It became popular throughout Lombardy for the duration of the 19th century. It spread to Piedmont where a double- ended version was adapted to local tastes and was popular until the 1950s.Piedmontese Della Rocca Tarot at the International Playing-Card Society. Retrieved 5 March 2017. =Early French decks and the Belgian pattern= A few early French decks exhibit certain curiosities. The 1557 luxury tarot deck by Catelin Geoffrey of Lyon, the early 17th century Tarot de Paris, and Jacques Viéville's Parisian deck (c.1650) share many things in common with each other and the Marseilles pattern but also have designs that seem to be derived from the Bologna-Florence tradition as seen in the Tarocco Bolognese and the Minchiate. Adam de Hautot of Rouen produced a deck similar to Viéville's around the second quarter of the 18th century where la Papesse is replaced with Le 'Spagnol Capitano Eracasse (Italian > the 'Spanish Captain' Fracasso, a stock character from Commedia dell'arte). The Pope, often depicted holding an orb or a covered communion chalice, is replaced by Bacus (Bacchus, the Greek god of wine) holding a wine cup or bottle and a fruited vine cane or bunch of grapes while astride a beer barrel or wine cask; this was copied from the Deuce of Acorns found in some German-suited patterns. The Hanged Man is shown still pendant but right-side up. Temperance bears the motto FAMA SOL (Latin > \\"The Rumored or Omened Day\\") in a scroll, probably counseling patience until the day of their deliverance from Spain. The Tower is renamed La Foudre (French > \\"The Lightning\\"), and shows a man sitting beneath a tree being struck by lightning. The Star shows a man with compasses staring up at the sky next to a tower. The Moon shows a woman holding a distaff and The Sun shows a man on horseback bearing a banner. The World depicts a naked woman atop a globe parted into a moon in a starry sky and a sun in a blue sky over a tower on land. Unusually, the Fool is numbered as trump XXII likely showing that it functioned as the highest trump. Very similar decks were soon produced in the Austrian Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) until the beginning of the 19th century. Packaging indicates that they were locally called \\"Cartes de Suisse\\".Belgian Tarot at the International Playing-Card Society. Retrieved 3 March 2017. This may suggest that Belgian players were being influenced by a new mode of play emanating from Switzerland in which the Fool is treated like the highest trump as in Troggu. Dummett conjectures that this family of decks, especially those of Viéville's design, originate from the Savoy-Piedmont- Lombardy region and were used until the collapse of the local card manufacturing industry at the end of the 17th century (as described above). Viéville's ordering of the trumps is almost identical to 16th century orders in Pavia and Mondovì. However, no cards from this region before the 18th century are known to have survived to prove or disprove this theory. Later history All cards were originally printed from woodcuts; the cards were later coloured either by hand or by the use of stencils. Tarot was recorded as being very popular card game throughout France during the 16th and early 17th century but later fell into obscurity with the exception of eastern France and Switzerland. Very few Marseilles pattern cards from the 17th century have survived, chiefly among them are Noblet's. In contrast, dozens of decks from the 18th century have made it to the present. From eastern France and Switzerland, the game spread north to Sweden and east to Russia starting from the middle of the 18th century, making it one of the most popular card games of that era until being overtaken by Whist in the 19th century. One well-known artisan producing tarot cards in the Marseilles pattern was Nicolas Conver (circa 1760). It was the Conver deck, or a deck very similar to it, that came to the attention of Antoine Court de Gébelin in the late 18th century. Court de Gébelin's writings, which contained much by way of speculation as to the supposed Egyptian origin of the cards and their symbols, called the attention of occultists to tarot decks. As such, Conver's deck became the model for most subsequent esoteric decks, starting with the deck designed by Etteilla forward. Cartomancy with the Tarot was definitely being practised throughout France by the end of the 18th century; Alexis-Vincent-Charles Berbiguier reported an encounter with two \\"sibyls\\" who divined with Tarot cards in the last decade of the century at Avignon. From the mid-18th to early 19th centuries, Marseilles and Besançon tarots were replaced by the French-suited animal tarots throughout most of Europe. These were then superseded by genre art tarots like the Industrie und Glück. French players ignored animal tarots but during the 20th century, they switched over to the genre art Tarot Nouveau. French truck drivers were still using the Marseilles pattern for French tarot as late as the 1970s. In 1997 Alejandro Jodorowsky and Phillipe Camoin completed their reconstructed version of the Tarot of Marseille. Since then Jodorowky, in collaboration with Marianne Costa, published a Tarot book based around this reconstructed version of the Marseille deck.Alejandro Jodorowsky & Marianne Costa (authors), Jon E. Graham (translator), The Way of Tarot: The Spiritual Teacher in the Cards, Destiny Books (2009) Influence on French and English tarot design and usage In the English-speaking world, where there is little or no tradition of using tarots as playing cards, tarot decks only became known through the efforts of occultists influenced by French tarotists such as Etteilla, and later, Eliphas Lévi. These occultists later produced esoteric decks that reflected their own ideas, and these decks were widely circulated in the anglophone world. Various esoteric decks such as the Rider-Waite-Smith deck (conceived by A. E. Waite and rendered by Pamela Colman Smith), and the Thoth Tarot deck (conceived by Aleister Crowley and rendered by Lady Frieda Harris)—and tarot decks inspired by those two decks—are most typically used. Waite, Colman Smith, Crowley and Harris were all former members of the influential, Victorian-era Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn at different respective points in time; and the Golden Dawn, in turn, was influenced by Lévi and other French occult revivalists. Although there were various other respective influences (e.g., Etteilla's pip card meanings in the case of Waite/Colman Smith), Waite/Colman Smith's and Crowley/Harris' decks were greatly inspired by the Golden Dawn's member-use tarot deck and the Golden Dawn's tarot curriculum. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was essentially the first in the Anglophone world to venture into esoteric tarot. Francophone occultists such as Court de Gebelin, Etteilla, Eliphas Lévi, Oswald Wirth and Papus were influential in fashioning esoteric tarot in the French-speaking world; the influence of these Francophone occultists has come to bear even on interpretation of the Tarot de Marseille cards themselves. Even though the Tarot de Marseille decks are not 'occult' \\"per se\\", the imagery of the Tarot de Marseille decks is claimed by Levi to have Hermetic influences (e.g., alchemy, astronomy, etc.). Referring to the Tarot, Eliphas Levi declares: \\"This book, which may be older than that of Enoch, has never been translated, but is still preserved unmutilated in primeval characters, on detached leaves, like the tablets of the ancients... It is, in truth, a monumental and extraordinary work, strong and simple as the architecture of the pyramids, and consequently enduring like those - a book which is the summary of all sciences, which can resolve all problems by its infinite combinations, which speaks by evoking thought, is the inspirer and moderator of all possible conceptions, and the masterpiece perhaps of the human mind. It is to be counted unquestionably among the very gret gifts bequeathed to us by antiquity...\\"Eliphas Levi Transcendental Magic, pp. 3-4, Samuel Weiser Inc., 1995 ; 1st English edition 1896 In the French-speaking world, users of the tarot for divination and other esoteric purposes such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Kris Hadar, and many others, continue to use the Tarot de Marseille, although Oswald Wirth's Atouts-only (major-arcana) tarot deck has enjoyed such popularity in the 20th century (albeit less so than the Tarot de Marseille). In the mid-1990s Jodorowsky contacted a late descendant of the Camoin family, who has printed the Tarot of Marseilles since the 19th century. They worked together for almost a decade to put together a 78-card deck, including the original detail and 11 color printing. Tarot decks from the English-speaking tradition (such as Rider-Waite-Colman Smith and decks based on it) are also gaining some popularity in French-speaking countries. Paul Marteau pioneered the number-plus-suit-plus-design approach to interpreting the numbered minor arcana cards ['pip cards'] of the Tarot de Marseille. Before Marteau's book Le Tarot de Marseille (which was first published \\"circa\\" 1930s), cartomantic meanings (such as Etteilla's) were generally the only ones published for interpreting Marseille pip cards. Even nowadays, as evidenced by tarot readings of members of French-language tarot lists and forums on the Internet, many French tarotists employ only the major arcana cards for divination. In fact, in recognition of this, many French-language Tarot de Marseille tarot books (even good ones, such as Picard's) discuss the symbolism and interpretation of only the major arcana. Many fortune-tellers in France who use the \\"Tarot de Marseille\\" for readings will use only the major arcana and will use an Etteilla deck if they are to use all 78 cards for the reading. Many of the images of the Rider-Waite-Colman Smith (RWS or WCS) deck are derived from the \\"Tarot de Marseille\\". However, the influence of other decks is also apparent in the RWCS deck, e.g., the 17th century Jacques Viéville deck for the Sun card and the 16th century Sola Busca tarot deck for certain pip cards, notably the 3 of Swords and 7 of Swords. The 19th century deck of Swiss-French occultist Oswald Wirth was also influential for certain of the iconographic features of the Atouts or major arcana cards of the RWCS deck. Reproductions Various facsimiles of Conver's deck and other old decks are available. The Italian firm Lo Scarabeo prints a reproduction of an 18th- century deck by Nicholas Conver (with a re-constructed card missing from their original), mentioned above . The French firm Héron also publishes a photoreproduction of the complete Conver held in the Bibliothèque Nationale. Others offer redrawn decks based on the old models. Grimaud is perhaps the best known such maker; their deck was designed by Paul Marteau, mentioned above. The Spanish firm Fournier prints an edition. Lo Scarabeo prints a version based on a 1751 Swiss deck by Claude Burdel, with an unwarranted alteration that sees a 'zero' added upon the Fou (But see Stuart Kaplan, Encyclopedia of Tarot Vol. II, page 327, which shows a 1750 Swiss deck by Rochus Schär. The Schär deck's Le Mat card is numbered with a zero). U.S. Games / Cartamundi also printed a version based on the 1701 Dodal Tarot de Marseille, but that version has gone out of print. Jean-Claude and Roxanne Flornoy have also published a careful rendition of the Noblet and the Dodal decks. In 1998, after four years of research, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Philippe Camoin published a restored version of the Tarot of Marseilles based on a study of all the oldest existing decks and wooden moulds (www.camoin.com). Also, Daniel Rodes and Encarna Sanchez have published a new edition called The anciens icons of tarot reconstructed about Marseille's Tarot. More recently, Igor Barzilai has published a restoration of the Nicolas Conver tarot, hand-painted and using old paper techniques. The Dodal deck held in the Bibliothèque Nationale has been photographically published by Dussere, but is now out of print.

It is the only one of its kind in France. The pedestal of the monument is made of Canigou granite. On it rest two white marble statues representing France and Britain. The pedestal itself is set upon a circular base. That in turn is located on a raised, level area of ground which covers 1,000 square metres and which is bounded by low stone walls. The idea of erecting this monument was conceived around 1912 by the town council and its then mayor, Monsieur Joseph Mercader. The wealthy British visitors who regularly came to this health spa at that time actively supported the project. A committee of prominent French and British patrons was set up to promote the scheme. Its leading members were Lord Roberts and General Joffre. Monsieur Lambert-Violet, a leading Perpignan businessman, gave the land for the memorial to Vernet. The monument itself was the work of the Roussillon sculptor Gustave Violet, who displayed a model of his proposed work in 1913. However, progress came to a halt in 1914 with the outbreak of World War One. Little further happened until August 1920, when it was proclaimed by presidential decree that work on the monument would proceed but that it would be dedicated both to the Entente Cordiale and to the memory of those killed during the war. At the same time a new appeal was launched for funds to complete the project. Work on erecting the monument soon got underway. Granite was hauled up from the bed of the River St-Vincent in carts pulled by oxen. The stonemason, Monsieur Herbetta, worked up to fourteen hours a day, often in the sun's full glare, fashioning and putting into place the enormously heavy blocks of stone. A circle of wrought-iron fencing was erected around the base of the monument. Monsieur Antoine Mercader remembers, as a six-year-old child, how he and other children watched as the craftsman, Monsieur Serra, poured molten lead into small holes in the ground to seal in place the fence's iron bars. When the monument was completed, it bore the following dedications: \\"To the Entente Cordiale between France and Britain. To the glory of the Allied Nations.

History The establishment of a constitutional monarchy in 1834 granted limited religious toleration to non-Roman Catholics, and consequently led to the opening of an Anglican chapel in Lisbon. A second chapel was opened in 1868. The Anglican mission coincided with the growing influence of the Old Catholic movement in Portugal. Congregations were created from Catholic priests and laypeople who refused to accept the dogmas of the infallibility and universal ordinary jurisdiction of the Pope, as defined by the First Vatican Council in 1870. The Lusitanian Church was formed in 1880 as representatives of these congregations met at a synod presided over by H.C. Riley, bishop of the newly formed mission in Mexico. The synod resulted in a constitution and a decision to abide by the doctrinal and liturgical standards of the Anglican Communion. In 1884, a Portuguese Book of Common Prayer was created, incorporating elements of Anglican, Roman, and Mozarabic liturgies. From the beginning the church was assisted by a Council of Bishops presided over by Lord Plunket, at that time Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath, and years afterwards there were some American Episcopal Bishops who provided Episcopal ministrations and pastoral care, particularly Bishops in Charge of the Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe, until the consecration of the first Lusitanian Bishop in 1958. Under the terms of the Bonn Agreement, the Lusitanian Church established full communion with various branches of the Anglican and Old Catholic Communions. Full integration into the Anglican Communion occurred in 1980 when the Church became an extra-provincial diocese under the metropolitical authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Membership The church has around 5,000 members.Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church membership Structure As an Episcopal denomination, the church is governed by a bishop (Greek, επίσκοπος episcopos). The Lusitanian Church is a diocese with two archdeaconries, for the North and South of Portugal, and 14 parishes. It also has missions. The bishop has his episcopal see at Lisbon, where his throne is located in St Paul's Cathedral. The administration of the diocese is centred at Oporto. Worship and liturgy The Lusitanian Church embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest, and bishop. Increasingly, an emphasis is being placed on these orders working collaboratively within the wider ministry of the whole people of God. A Portuguese language Prayer Book is the basis of the Church's liturgy. In the early days of the church, a translation into Portuguese from 1849 of the 1662 edition of the Book of Common Prayer was used. In 1884 the church published its own prayer book based on the Anglican, Roman and Mozarabic liturgies. The intent was to emulate the customs of the primitive apostolic church.Rowthorn, Jeffery. \\"Anglican Churches in Europe.\\" Pages 439-442. IN: Hefling, Charles C., and Cynthia L. Shattuck.The Oxford Guide to the Book of Common Prayer: A Worldwide Survey. Page 440. Ecumenical relations Like many other Anglican churches, the Lusitanian Church has entered into full communion with the Old Catholics. The church is now also a part of the Porvoo Communion, a communion of Anglican and Nordic Lutheran churches.

As of the 2010 Census, its population was 31,665. Veliky Ustyug has a great historical significance and was one of the major cities of the Russian North. It preserved some of the past urban structure and many of the architectural monuments. It has lost its former leading role and is nowadays mostly known for tourism. Location and etymology Veliky Ustyug is close to the confluence of the Sukhona (flowing from the west) and the Yug (from the south) rivers. Downstream from this confluence the rivers form a single waterway known as the Northern Dvina, sometimes referred to as the Little Northern Dvina. The historical center of the town is on the left (high) bank of the Sukhona and, in contrast to many historical Russian towns, there is an embankment along the Sukhona. Dymkovskaya Sloboda and Troitse-Gledensky Monastery are on the right bank of the Sukhona. New parts of the town, mostly industrial areas, face the Northern Dvina. The only bridge in Veliky Ustyug is across the Sukhona upstream of the town center. Previously, Gleden was a fortress, and the left bank of the Sukhona was a posad—a territory outside the fortress populated by craftsmen. In the 15th century, the fortress was destroyed in an attack by Vyatka army, and the new fortress was built in the former posad area. The fortress was demolished when it became apparent than no military threat to Veliky Ustyug exists. The first recorded settlement in the area was the monastic settlement at Gleden (), founded near the confluence of the Yug and the Sukhona, where Troitsko-Gledensky Monastery is now. The name Ustyug means \\"the mouth of the Yug\\". By the late 15th century, the name changed to Veliky (Great) Ustyug. History St. Prokopy, the Ustyug icon from 1669, Velikoustyugsky Museum of History, Art, and Architecture The town of Veliky Ustyug was first mentioned in a chronicle in 1207. In 1212, Mikhaylo-Arkhangelsky Monastery was founded. It was a part of the Vladimir- Suzdal Principality (in contrast to the neighboring lands, most notably Totma, colonized by Novgorod). Thus Veliky Ustyug created the only obstacle to Novgorod's trade with the north, as the Sukhona and the Northern Dvina were the main waterways connecting Novgorod with the White Sea. Clashes between Novgorod and Ustyug became regular, especially throughout the whole 14th century. In 1328, Ustyug was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The town was not immediately affected by the Mongol invasion of Rus' in the 13th century; however, its rapid growth in the second half of the century was due to influx of refugees from Central Russia. In the 15th century, Veliky Ustyug became notable for the war between Vasily II of Moscow and his cousin Dmitry Shemyaka, which left northern Russia deserted. Shemyaka took Veliky Ustyug in 1450, drowned in the Sukhona those citizens who refused to accept him as a prince, and made the town his residence for two years, until he was driven off by the forces of Vasily. In the 15th century, the town had a great military importance and became the base for the operations against the Finno-Ugric peoples. In 1613, during the Time of Troubles, Veliky Ustyug was besieged by Polish troops but never taken. At the junction of important trade routes, the town turned into a significant commercial and industrial center in the 16th and 17th centuries. Veliky Ustyug area was the birthplace of the explorers Semyon Dezhnyov, Yerofey Khabarov, Vladimir Atlasov, and of St. Stephen of Perm. Veliky Ustyug lost its key role as a river port with the diminishing importance of the Sukhona River route for trade between China and western Europe, which started with the foundation of Saint-Petersburg in 1703, whereby the trade was diverted to the Baltic Sea. The 16th and 17th centuries were the time of the highest rise of the culture in Veliky Ustyug, in which it acquired a national-wide significance. The town is known for its remarkable handicrafts, such as silver filigree, birch bark fretwork, decorative copper binding, and niello. The town developed a distinct manner of icon painting — Ustyug icon painting. In the 17th century, Veliky Ustyug was a major producer of tiles, which are visible on many Ustyug churches and were sold to neighboring towns of the Russian North. On January 25, 1613, the town was unsuccessfully besieged by Polish-Lithuanian vagabonds (see Lisowczycy) led by Jakub Jacki. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Veliky Ustyug was explicitly mentioned as one of the 20 towns included into the Archangelgorod Governorate. From 1719, it was the center of Ustyug Province, one of the four provinces of the Governorate. In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. The latter was abolished in 1796, and Veliky Ustyug became the center of Velikoustyugsky Uyezd of Vologda Governorate. In 1918, the town became the administrative center of the newly established Northern Dvina Governorate. In 1924, the uyezds were abolished in favor of the new divisions, the districts (raions). In 1929, Northern Dvina Governorate was merged into Northern Krai. The krai consisted of five okrugs, one of which, Northern Dvina Okrug, had its administrative center in Veliky Ustyug. In July 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to Northern Krai. In 1936, Northern Krai was transformed into Northern Oblast, and in 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Veliky Ustyug remained in Vologda Oblast ever since. Veliky Ustyug, in contrast to the majority of historical Russian towns, managed to preserve almost all of its architectural and cultural monuments. This was in a great part due to the efforts of the local intellectuals grouped around the Regional Museum, and most notably of Nikolay Bekryashev, the museum director from 1924 to 1938. This group managed to convince the authorities that the churches and old buildings have a historical significance and must be handed in the museum rather than demolished. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Veliky Ustyug serves as the administrative center of Velikoustyugsky District, even though it is not a part of it.Resolution #178 As an administrative division, it is, together with the town of Krasavino and the work settlement of Kuzino, incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Veliky Ustyug—one of the four administrative units in the oblast with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #371-OZ Within the framework of municipal divisions, the town of Veliky Ustyug, together with the village of Slobodka in Yudinsky Selsoviet of Velikoustyugsky District is incorporated as Veliky Ustyug Urban Settlement within Velikoustyugsky Municipal District.Law #1109-OZ The town of Krasavino, together with six rural localities in Krasavinsky Selsoviet of Velikoustyugsky District, is incorporated as Krasavino Urban Settlement, and the work settlement of Kuzino is incorporated as Kuzino Urban Settlement; both also within Velikoustyugsky Municipal District. Economy =Industry= There are timber industry enterprises in Veliky Ustyug, as well as a shipyard, food industry, and enterprises serving the tourist industry — in particular, the jewelry production plant. Tourism is an important branch of economy in Veliky Ustyug. It started in the 1960s and got a further boost in 1990s when Veliky Ustyug started to be marketed as the residence of Ded Moroz, also known as \\"Grandfather Frost\\". =Transportation= Roads connect Veliky Ustyug with other towns. The road to the north runs to Krasavino and further to Kotlas. The one to the south runs to Nikolsk and further to Manturovo, where it connects to the road to Kostroma. The road to the southwest connects Veliky Ustyug with Vologda via Totma. It was built in the beginning of the 21st century; before this road was opened, the only way to get from Veliky Ustyug to Vologda was via Nikolsk and Totma. All these roads are paved. An unpaved road, originating from Kuzino (which is connected with Veliky Ustyug by a ferry crossing) runs to Luza and continues to Lalsk and further to the Komi Republic. The railroad connects Veliky Ustyug with Yadrikha railway station on the railroad connecting Konosha and Kotlas. The passenger service to Veliky Ustyug was discontinued in 2005. The Sukhona, the Yug, and the Northern Dvina are all navigable in Veliky Ustyug, but there is no passenger navigation except for ferry crossings. Veliky Ustyug is served by the Veliky Ustyug Airport with occasional passenger service to Vologda. Demographics The population of Veliky Ustyug was steadily growing until the second half of 20th century, but in the recent years it has been on decline, as is the general trend in Russia. Main sights Veliky Ustyug by Ivan Bilibin, around 1900 St. Nicholas Church and the bell-tower Veliky Ustyug preserves much of its architectural heritage and has one of the best preserved architectural ensembles in Russia. The town contains 152 objects classified as cultural and historical heritage by the Russian Federal law and 25 objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local importance. It is classified as a historical town by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in the historical center. Most of the architectural monuments are on the left bank of the Sukhona, and many of these are the living houses. The exceptions are Troitsko-Gledensky Monastery and the Dymkovo Sloboda, on the right bank of the Sukhona. Troitsko-Gledensky Monastery is in the village of Morozovitsa, in Velikoustyugsky District. The principal architectural ensembles of Veliky Ustyg are *The old Sobornoye Dvorishche (Cathedral Square), with the ensemble of Assumption Cathedral (1619–1659), the St. Prokopius Cathedral (1668, Prokopius is the local saint who lived in Ustyug), the Cathedral of St. John the Righteous (1656—1663), and the Epiphany Church (1689) *Mikhaylo-Arkhangelsky Monastery with the Cathedral of Archangel Michael (1653—1656), the Presentation Church (1653), the Gate Church of St. Vladimir (1682), and the Church of Mid-Pentecost (1710), the wall with towers and the cells *Former transfiguration monastery: The Transfiguration Church, the Presentation Church (1725–1739), and the St. George Church (1696–1704) *The St. Nicholas Church with the bell-tower (17th century) *The Ascension Church (1648) *The Church of Women Bearing Myrrh (1714–1722) *The Church of St. Simeon the Stylite (18th century) The monuments of civil architecture are mostly concentrated along the Sukkhona, along Sovetsky Avenue and Krasnaya Street. Some of these buildings belong to the Velikoustyugsky Museum of History, Art, and Architecture. The museum was open in 1909 in the premises of Mikhaylo-Arkhangelsky Monastery. In 1918 it was transformed into the Museum of the Northern Dvina Culture. Between 1924 and 1938 the museum director was Nikolay Bekryashev, an artist, who devoted his energy to extending the museum to the old buildings, mostly churches, of the town, which thus were saved from destruction. In particular, a big collection of icons and objects of applied arts survived. Despite the efforts of Bekryashev and other museum employees, some of the buildings were destroyed by the authorities. The museum currently serves as an umbrella institution that organizes permanent and temporary exhibits in the former church buildings. Culture In 1998, Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov proposed to officially locate the residence of Ded Moroz, a fictional character somewhat similar to Santa Claus, in Veliky Ustyug. The residence, which is a resort promoted as the Votchina (\\"estate\\") of Ded Moroz, is a major tourist attraction. It is 16 km from the town, on the premises of Velikoustyugsky District. There is a dedicated post office there that answers children's mail to Ded Moroz. See also *Ustyug Annunciation References =Notes= =Sources=  Further reading * Ustyug Great.

The Kiran was developed at the behest of the Indian Air Force (IAF), who sought a new intermediate trainer aircraft for its pilots. On 4 September 1964, the type performed its maiden flight; mass production commenced shortly thereafter. It has been adopted by the IAF, which uses the type to conduct intermediate training of pilots following on from basic trainers such as the HPT-32 Deepak and Pilatus PC-7. Furthermore, during the 1980s, the IAF procured a number of Kirans that were furnished with a more powerful engine and a higher number of hard points; the variant was designated Kiran Mk II. It has also been adopted by the Indian Naval Air Arm. The last Kiran was completed during 1989, after which the assembly line was shuttered. The Kiran has been in operational use for over 50 years. Since the late 1990s, an indigenously designed successor, the HAL HJT-36 Sitara, has been in development, but has yet to enter service as of 2019. By the 2010s, use of the type was gradually declining as increasing numbers of newer BAE Systems Hawks, built under license by HAL, have been introduced to IAF service. The Kiran has been used by the Indian naval aerobatic team Sagar Pawan and was also used by the aerobatic team Surya Kiran of the IAF up until February 2011, at which point the team was disbanded after its aircraft were diverted to train fighter pilots. The Surya Kiran display team has been reequipped with specially- equipped Hawks. During December 2018, a handful of Kirans were donated by India to Myanmar. Development A Kiran II on static display at the HAL Museum, Bangalore, 2011 The Kiran was developed by Indian aircraft manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in response the issuing of an Indian Air Force (IAF) requirement that called for a new intermediate jet- powered trainer aircraft. HAL's design team devised a relatively conventional trainer; according to author Chris Smith, their design was closely modelled on the BAC Jet Provost, an existing British jet trainer.Smith 1994, p. 157. HAL chose to adopt the British-sourced Rolls Royce Viper 11 turbojet engine, capable of generating up to of thrust, to serve as its powerplant. According to Smith, the development of what would become Kiran proved beneficial to other HAL projects, the design team being later redeployed to the HF-24 Marut, an indigenously designed fighter-bomber.Smith 1994, p. 157. On 4 September 1964, a prototype performed the type's maiden flight.Taylor 1982, p. 92. The initial production aircraft was designated Kiran I; during March 1968, the first deliveries of the pre-production aircraft were made to the IAF. Proving satisfactory, full-scale production of the type was approved shortly thereafter. Later production aircraft were fitted with hard points underneath each wing, which were intended for weapon training purposes; this modification led to such aircraft being redesignated as Kiran IA. A total of 190 Mk I and 1A aircraft were manufactured. During the 1970s, work was undertaken by HAL on an uprated version of the aircraft; it was instead powered by the Bristol Siddeley Orpheus turbojet engine, capable of generating a maximum thrust of . This variant, which was also furnished with an enhanced weapon-carrying capability, was designated Kiran Mk II. On 30 July 1976, this variant performed its first flight.Taylor 1988, p. 98. Around this time, India was seeking a more advanced trainer aircraft in response to difficulties experienced with trainee pilots transitioning from the original Kiran to frontline fighter aircraft.Smith 1994, p. 165. Deliveries of the improved model commenced during 1985; production of the Kiran was terminated during 1989.Donald and Lake 1996, p. 201. Operational history Since the initial aircraft first being delivered in 1968, the Kiran has been operated by both the IAF and the Indian Navy for the intermediate elements of their training syllabuses. Since the late 1990s, HAL has been working on developing a successor to the Kiran, which has been designated HJT-36 Sitara.\\"Indian air force Kirans to fly on, as IJT wait continues.\\" Flight International, 14 February 2014.

It was named after the Welsh language S4C programme magazine called Sbec (Welsh for 'peek') which was originally a pull-out of the TVTimes in the ITV Wales area. Content Sbectel provided listings and information about S4C's programmes, such as previews of programmes and further information related to the programmes. Pages were provided in both Welsh and English. The programme was separate from the auxiliary and separately-licensed teletext service also available on the channel. Sbectel also provided subtitles for S4C's programmes on page 888 in English and page 889 in Welsh. History / Future Sbectel was first run in conjunction with ORACLE, the auxiliary teletext provider on Channel 4 in the 1980s. Sbectel occupied pages 410-499 within the page space. When ORACLE lost its licence and was replaced by Teletext Ltd. in 1993, Sbectel moved to its own page space on pages 300-399 and became directly run by S4C. In 2003, Sbectel moved to pages 400-499 (which replaced pages 300-399 as S4C's page space). This was due to Channel 4 (the equivalent of S4C in the United Kingdom outside Wales) closing their Sbectel equivalent, FourText (formerly 4-Tel), and launching a new teletext service in conjunction with Teletext Ltd, Teletext on 4, on pages 400-499.

Performing In 1987, Banks landed his first acting role, performing as a minor character in the fantasy-comedy Date with an Angel. Banks hit it big when he developed (and starred in) a one-man theatrical show titled Home Entertainment Center – a comedic play about an easily distracted procrastinator trying to meet a work deadline. He gave 440 performances of Home Entertainment Center at venues like the Canon Theater, Pasadena Playhouse, Marines' Memorial Theater, and The One Act in San Francisco (where the show ran for eleven months). For his performances, he was awarded the LA Weekly Theater Award, four Drama-Logue Awards, and three San Francisco Bay Area Critic's Awards. He also performed at the Aspen Comedy festival, the Cast Theater, Callboard Theater, and Las Palmas Theater. In 1989, Home Entertainment Center achieved national fame when it was filmed and aired on Showtime; the filming was done at the Marines' Memorial Theater. The show featured original songs written and performed by Banks. On May 14, 1989, he appeared (with Penn Jillette) on the Dr. Demento radio program (that year's Mother's Day Special) and performed a number of his songs live on-air. The ensuing fame landed him a TV pilot on Showtime in January 1991 – The Steven Banks Show (sometimes inaccurately referenced as The Steven Brooks Show). The plot of the show was much the same as his one-act play: Banks portrayed Steven Brooks – an underachieving, chronic procrastinator fascinated by trivia and cursed with a penchant for comedic songs. In the summer of 1991, after Paul Reubens was arrested for allegedly masturbating in an adult movie theater, Banks was among a number of entertainers who protested the decision of CBS to drop Reubens' show from their lineup. Banks can be seen in a crowd of protestors on an LA street in the E! True Hollywood Story episode about Reubens' arrest. Reubens was later offered (and declined) a supporting role on Banks' fledgling TV program. Showtime aired the pilot for Banks' show, but never ran any other episodes. In 1994, PBS took an interest in his act. They filmed and aired The Steven Banks Show that summer – the first original sitcom ever produced and run by PBS. Brandon Tartikoff produced the show, filmed at WYES in New Orleans. A CD album for the show was also released, consisting of original songs written and performed by Banks. Thirteen episodes were shot and the program garnered critical acclaim, but one episode, \\"Miss Janie Regrets\\", was not aired due to controversy over a PBS- like children's show parody. Banks' show has attained a kind of cult status despite its short run on PBS. In one episode, Penn Jillette sang and played guitar, Teller on keyboard, joining Steven Banks. The song was \\"I wear the clothes of the dead\\", the setup for which was Penn wearing suits bought at estate sales. Banks has appeared in movies and several TV shows such as Beverly Hills Cop III, Dharma & Greg, King of the Hill, Dream On, Caroline in the City, The Jimmy Kimmel Show, Parks and Recreation, Mom, and My Crazy Ex- Girlfriend. Billy the Mime Banks performed as \\"Billy the Mime\\" in the 2005 comedic documentary The Aristocrats which was created by Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza. Other appearances include Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Penn & Teller's Bullshit!, Parks & Recreation (his scene was cut out), and The Green Room with Paul Provenza. Billy the Mime presented a six-week engagement at The Flea Theater in New York and has also appeared at The Upright Citizens Brigade Theater (LA and NYC), The New York International Fringe Festival, The Montreal Just For Laughs Festival, The Aspen Comedy Festival, SketchFest (San Francisco), The Revolutions International Theater Festival (New Mexico), The Lakeshore Theater (Chicago), and in Los Angeles at The Actors Gang, Sit 'n Spin, Largo, The Comedy Central Stage, The Steve Allen Theater in Girly Magazine Party and The Rudy Casoni Show and the Sacred Fools Theater Company. In March 2012, he performed in San Paolo, Brazil at the Risadaria Comedy Festival and did 24 shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August. He founded Billy's Moving Art Gallery in 2014. Their slogan is \\"Bringing Affordable Art To The Masses Since 2014\\". His paintings have hung in The Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Whitney Art Museum in New York, in The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Getty, The Broad and The Armand Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, The Hamburger Bahnhof Museum and The East Side Berlin Wall Gallery in Berlin. Writing In 1998, Banks began writing for Nickelodeon's animated series CatDog. He wrote several CatDog books as well. He continued working for Nickelodeon, penning several SpongeBob books (including The Big Halloween Scare, which actually charted on The New York Times bestseller list). In 2002, Banks was named head writer for The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, and in 2004, he was nominated for one of the 56th Annual Writers Guild Awards for the episode Rescue Jet Fusion. In 2004, he wrote for Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi, an animated series from the Cartoon Network about the adventures of real life J-pop music stars Ami Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura. In late 2004, he became story editor and then head writer for SpongeBob SquarePants for seasons 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. He was nominated for an Emmy in 2008 for the SpongeBob episode he wrote, \\"The Two Faces of Squidward.\\" Banks and Penn Jillette also collaborated in writing Love Tapes – an unconventional love story for the stage which premiered February 2005 at Sacred Fools Theater in Hollywood. Banks' novel, King of the Creeps, was published by [Knopf] in 2006. In 2009, he collaborated with the dance company Pilobolus co-creating a full-evening piece, Shadowland, currently touring internationally. He developed the CGI series and wrote the pilot for Nickelodeon's Planet Sheen. His play, Looking at Christmas, opened in New York at The Flea Theater November 20, 2010 and was filmed by local television station WNET. That play aired on WNET the following year in December 2011. Banks was profiled in the New York Times Sunday Arts & Leisure Section on November 28, 2010. He wrote the pilot for the Arnold Schwarzenegger / Stan Lee animated series The Governator.http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/governator- recruits-spongebob-writer-steven-banks/ In 2012, he wrote the pilot for a new updated version of the 1960s animated classic Underdog for Red Kite Animation, and co-developed Supernuts! with Niki Yang for Nickelodeon. In October 2012, he joined the staff of Two and a Half Men as Co-Producer. In 2013, he wrote a one-hour dramedy pilot called A Beautiful Mess for Chuck Lorre Productions. He co-created and directed, with Pilobolus, Shadowland, which has been performed in 31 countries and sold over 500,000 tickets. It is currently touring the US. A new full-evening piece, Shadowland II: The Adventure Continues, premiered in Berlin in 2016. His play Looking at Christmas was published by Broadway Play Publishing in 2016. In 2016, he was also the head writer for Genius Brands' SpacePOP series.https://www.awn.com/news/gbi-debut-spacepop-summer-2016 As of 2017, Banks is developing an adult animated action/comedy project for Sony Animation and Netflix about a very famous rock and roll star who faked his own death in 1977 and became a secret agent. As of 2018, Banks is consulting/writing on a Lego animated series project. The first book in his original book series, Middle School Bites, will be published by Holiday House and distributed by Penguin Random House in 2020.  SpongeBob SquarePants  In 2005, Banks joined SpongeBob in season 4 as head writer and story editor for six years. SpongeBob producer Eric Coleman, called Banks to tell him he was being considered by executive producers Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt to become a writer on the show. Banks was already a huge fan of the show and described the hiring process as being interviewed by Paul Tibbitt for about five minutes.

His noted comic book work includes the series DMZ, Demo, Northlanders, his web series work includes adaptations of short stories from the comics series The Massive for Geek & Sundry, and his video game work includes co-writing 1979 Revolution: Black Friday. Early life Wood graduated from Parsons School of Design in 1997. Comics career Wood's first professional work in comics was the 5-issue miniseries Channel Zero, published by Image Comics from 1997 to 1998, initially created as part of a final project for graduation from Parsons School of Design. Channel Zero is set in a dystopian near-future New York City where the tenets of Mayor Giuliani have grown into a freedom-restricting government initiative called 'The Clean Act'. The protagonist is Jennie 2.5, a DIY media personality. Channel Zero was orphaned shortly after Image Comics sold out of the first print run of the collection, opting not to return to press. AiT/Planet Lar acquired it soon afterwards. Wood was absent from comics for two years, working at a series of Internet design jobs during the dot-com boom.Varmus, Chris (July 14, 2007). \\"Sketched out\\". The Brooklyn Paper. In early 2000, Warren Ellis offered Wood a co-writing job on Marvel Comics' Generation X, as part of Ellis's Counter-X run (in which Ellis served as \\"Plotmaster\\"). Wood co-wrote issues #63–70 with Ellis, and wrote #71–75 on his own. Wood returned to creator-owned comics between 2000 and 2003, producing several graphic novels and miniseries, including Couscous Express, The Couriers, and Jennie One for AIT, Pounded for Oni Press, and Fight For Tomorrow for DC's imprint Vertigo. He was employed as AIT's art director for roughly six months, creating not only their logo and branding, but covers for many of the books they published during this time. He worked again with Ellis, creating 14 covers for the Wildstorm series Global Frequency. In late 2003, Wood quit his staff job at Rockstar GamesManning, Shaun (August 4, 2003). \\"WWC: Brian Wood One-on-One\\". Comic Book Resources. and teamed with artist Becky Cloonan to create the monthly series Demo. Each of the 12 issues told its own complete story, and included eight pages of \\"backmatter\\", bonus material that was intentionally left out of the eventual collected edition. The Demo format proved so successful that Wood went on to replicate it, with minor changes, for his 12-issue series Local at Oni Press, begun in 2005 and drawn by artist Ryan Kelly. Local differs from Demo in that it includes a focal character, Megan McKeenan, whose character arc is gradually traced through the series, although she is not always the protagonist within each issue. This difference has led Local down its own path; Wood refers to it as \\"transcending its 'done in one' format to really be about Megan's story, her life, that progression over time\\". 2006 saw the publication of the graphic novel The Tourist from Image Comics, and Supermarket, a four-issue series from IDW co-created and drawn by Kristian Donaldson. In August 2006, DC Comics announced that Wood was signed to an exclusive contract. Wood co-created the Vertigo series DMZ, Northlanders, a historical-fiction series set during the Viking Age, The New York Four and The New York Five, a young adult series, and a new Demo miniseries. For DC/Wildstorm, he wrote a DV8 miniseries with Rebekah Isaacs, and a Supernatural miniseries with Grant Bond. In August 2011, Wood discussed the conclusion of Northlanders, the ending of his exclusive and regular work for DC Comics, and the rumors he was working on a Supergirl series for the New 52. Shortly after his DC Comics exclusive ended, Wood wrote a series of X-Men comics for Marvel, starting with the Wolverine & The X-Men: Alpha and Omega miniseries. He was then announced as the ongoing writer of the \\"adjectiveless\\" X-Men title and penned issues #30–37. He signed on to Ultimate Comics: X-Men and wrote issues #13–33.

Newsarama Wood returned to Image Comics with an omnibus edition of The Couriers, followed by three new monthly series: Mara with Ming Doyle, Starve with collaborators Danijel Zezelj and Dave Stewart, and Black Road with Garry Brown. Wood shifted the bulk of his creator owned work to Dark Horse Comics following his time at DC Comics. He created and authored the five-volume The Massive, followed by the prequel series The Massive Ninth Wave, with art by Garry Brown, JP Leon, and Kristian Donaldson, among others. Rebels, a historical series set during the American Revolution, was co-created in 2014 with artist Andrea Mutti. In 2017, Wood and Andrea Mutti returned for a second Rebels series, entitled These Free and Independent States. Briggs Land, described as a crime series set within an American secessionist movement, is Wood's newest socio-political series, and secured a television deal with AMC prior to publication of the comic. Currently there are two volumes of Briggs Land in print. Wood also brought the Channel Zero, Demo, and The New York Four properties to Dark Horse, who collected and printed them in comprehensive omnibus editions. He also did a 25-issue stint on Dark Horse's Conan the Barbarian, a 20-issue run on Star Wars, and a miniseries leading into the release of the Eve: Valkyrie virtual reality video game. In 2016, Wood and artist Tristan Jones launched Aliens: Defiance, a new monthly series in the mold of the original 1979 film, in which they introduced the point-of-view character Zula Hendricks, who was later featured in the video game Alien: Isolation and the novel Alien: Prototype. In September 2018, Dark Horse announced Aliens: Resistance, written by Wood with art by Robert Carey, Dan Jackson, and Tristan Jones. It was followed soon after by Aliens: Rescue. In June 2018, Wood and Mack Chater launched the monthly series Sword Daughter. Video game career Prior to his comics career, Wood held a day job for several years as a staff designer for Rockstar Games, designing for video game franchises such as Grand Theft Auto, Midnight Club, Max Payne, Smuggler's Run, and Manhunt. Wood is credited with co-writing 1979 Revolution: Black Friday, created by Navid Khonsari. Film and television career Wood is credited as writing two web series in 2012 for Geek & Sundry adapting three The Massive short stories and the first story arc of his and Becky Cloonan's Conan the Barbarian. In January 2007 Intrepid Pictures acquired the feature film rights to The Couriers, the graphic novel series by Wood and artist Rob G. Javier Grillo-Marxuach is set to pen the screenplay. In 2014, Warner Horizon were reported to be developing a DMZ television show, based on Wood and Burchielli's comic book, with producer David Heyman and Andre and Maria Jacquemetton for the Syfy network. In May 2016, Wood's comic book series Briggs Land was reported to be in development for AMC, with A24 as producing partners. Wood is acting as executive producer as well as writing the pilot episode. In January 2020, a new DMZ deal was announced, this time for HBO Max, with Ava DuVernay directing, Roberto Patino showrunning, and Rosario Dawson in a lead role. Accusations of sexual misconduct In November 2013, cartoonist Tess Fowler accused Wood of sexual harassment in offering her his hotel room number at a bar during San Diego Comic-Con in 2003. In August 2019, Laura Hudson stated that in 2007, before she founded ComicsAlliance, Wood had attempted to kiss her at a bar. Laura Hudson's account brought her to the attention of Ava DuVernay, who hired her as a staff writer on the television pilot of Wood's DMZ. On August 21, 2020, The Comics Journal reported that following Hudson's employment on DMZ, her tweets about Brian Wood were deleted. In 2013, Wood apologized to Fowler, stating in part, \\"when she declined, that was the conclusion of the matter for me. There was never an exertion of power, no threats, and no revenge...\\" He went on to state, \\"I think the larger issues of abuse in the comics industry are genuine and I share everyone's concerns. I don't want our difference of accounts to take attention away from that industry-wide discussion that needs to happen.\\" Fowler acknowledged that she had forgiven Wood years earlier, and responded in part: \\"Brian Wood has every right to be a part of comics. To make books and make a living unhindered. I believe that. I also believe his behavior is a symptom of a much bigger disease.\\" Bibliography =DMZ= DMZ (script and art, with Riccardo Burchielli, Kristian Donaldson, Nathan Fox, Danijel Žeželj, Nikki Cook, Ryan Kelly, Andrea Mutti, Cliff Chiang, David Lapham, Shawn Martinbrough and others, DC Comics/Vertigo, 2006–2012) collected as: *On the Ground (collects #1–5, tpb, 128 pages, 2006, ) *Body of a Journalist (collects #6–12, tpb, 168 pages, 2007, ) *Public Works (collects #13–17, tpb, 128 pages, 2007, ) *Friendly Fire (collects #18–22, tpb, 128 pages, 2008, ) *The Hidden War (collects #23–28, tpb, 144 pages, 2008, ) *Blood in the Game (collects #29–34, tpb, 144 pages, 2009, ) *War Powers (collects #35–41, tpb, 168 pages, 2009, ) *Hearts and Minds (collects #42–49, tpb, 192 pages, 2010, ) *M.I.A.

Paeonia once stretched north of Macedon, into Dardania, and in earlier times into southwestern Thrace. Classification Classical sources usually considered the Paeonians distinct from Thracians or Illyrians, comprising their own ethnicity and language. Athenaeus seems to have connected the Paeonian tongue to the barely-attested Mysian language, possibly a member of the Anatolian family. On the other hand, the Paeonians were also regarded as being related to Thracians and ancestors of the Phrygians. Modern linguists are uncertain on the classification of Paeonian, due to the extreme scarcity of surviving materials in the language. Wilhelm Tomaschek and Paul Kretschmer claim it belonged to the Illyrian family, while Dimitar Dechev claims affinities with Thracian. Irwin L. Merker considers Paeonian closely related to Greek, a Hellenic language with \\"a great deal of Illyrian and Thracian influence as a result of this proximity\\". Paeonian vocabulary Several Paeonian words are known from classical sources: *monapos, monaipos, the European bison *tilôn, a species of fish once found in Lake Prasias *paprax, a species of fish once found in Lake Prasias. Paprakas, masc. acc. pl. A number of anthroponyms (some known only from Paeonian coinage) are attested: Agis (Άγις), Patraos (Πατράος), Lycpeios (Λύκπειος), Audoleon (Αυδολέων), Eupolemos (Εὐπόλεμος), Ariston (Αρίστων), etc. In addition several toponyms (Bylazora (Βυλαζώρα), Astibos (Άστιβος) and a few theonyms Dryalus (Δρύαλος), Dyalos (Δύαλος), the Paeonian Dionysus, as well as the following: * Pontos, affluent of the Strumica River, perhaps from *ponktos, \\"boggy\\" (cf. German feucht, \\"wet\\", Middle Irish éicne \\"salmon\\", Sanskrit pánka \\"mud, mire\\", pontos \\"passage\\", \\"way\\" Greek); * Idomenae (Ιδομένη) (nowadays near Gevgelija), name of a city (cf.

Old Prussian stabis \\"rock\\", Old Church Slavonic stoboru, \\"pillar\\", Old English stapol, \\"post\\", Ancient Greek stobos, \\"scolding, bad language\\"); * Dysoron (Δύσορον) (nowadays Dysoro (Δύσορο)), name of a mountain, from \\"dys-\\", \\"bad\\" (cf. Greek dyskolos \\"difficult\\", and \\"oros\\" Greek oros, \\"mountain\\"); * Agrianes, name of a tribe, possibly from *agro- \\"field\\" (cf.

He served as the non-executive chairman of Freddie Mac from September 2008 to December 2011, retiring from the board in February 2012. On December 20, 2013, Koskinen was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to head the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. On December 23, 2013, Koskinen was sworn in as the 48th IRS Commissioner after being nominated by President Barack Obama. His term ended on November 12, 2017, with David Kautter becoming his interim replacement, followed by Charles P. Rettig as his permanent replacement. Early life Koskinen was born on June 30, 1939 in Cleveland, Ohio. In 1957, Koskinen graduated High School at Ashland High School (now known as Paul G. Blazer High School) in Ashland, Kentucky. He graduated magna cum laude with a BA in physics from Duke University in 1961, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity and Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated with an Bachelor of Laws, cum laude from Yale Law School in 1964, and did postgraduate work at Queens' College, Cambridge in England from 1964–65. Career Koskinen served as president of the U.S. Soccer Foundation from 2004–08. He previously served as the deputy mayor of the District of Columbia, the deputy director for management of the Office of Management and Budget, and then later President Clinton's chairman of the President's Council on Y2K, 2000 Conversion, the Year 2000 problem. He served on the board of AES from 2004–13 and American Capital, Ltd from 2007–13. On March 11, 2009, he was announced as the interim CEO at Freddie Mac. On April 23, 2009, he became the principal financial officer after the death of Freddie Mac's acting CFO, David Kellermann. In August 2009, with the hiring of a new CEO, he returned to his position as non- executive chairman of the board of Freddie Mac. Prior to entering government service, Koskinen worked for 21 years for The Palmieri Company as vice president, president, CEO, and chairman, working on the turnaround of large, failed enterprises such as the Penn Central Transportation Company, Levitt and Sons, the Teamsters Pension Fund, Mutual Benefit, and Equity Programs Investment Corporation. Earlier in his career, Koskinen served as administrative assistant to Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn.) from 1969–73, was legislative assistant to Mayor John Lindsay of New York City from 1968–69, served as assistant to the deputy executive director of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (the \\"Kerner Commission\\") from 1967–68, practiced law with the firm of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher from 1966–67, and clerked for Judge David Bazelon, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, from 1965 to 1966. Koskinen chaired the Washington, D.C. host committee for the 1994 World Cup and the Duke University board of trustees. He is a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration. =Appointment as IRS Commissioner= On August 1, 2013, the White House announced President Obama would nominate Koskinen as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. On December 20, 2013, Senate Democrats voted 56–39 for cloture on the nomination, cutting off a Republican-led filibuster. Senators then confirmed Koskinen in a 59–36 vote, along party lines. On December 23, 2013, he was sworn in as the 48th IRS Commissioner. Koskinen took office following the IRS scandal in which conservative political groups were targeted for extensive scrutiny by the IRS. The Washington Post awarded Koskinen \\"Three Pinocchios\\" for stating during congressional testimony on March 26, 2014, that \\"the inspector general found inappropriate criteria were used to select organizations for further review—he did not refer to it as targeting.\\" In June 2014, Koskinen informed Congress that 30,000 emails from the account of a central figure in the scandal, Lois Lerner, had been lost. It later came to light that Koskinen had known about the lost emails in April and had waited until the information was disclosed in a court case to notify Congress. Koskinen stated: \\"We confirmed that backup tapes from 2011 no longer existed because they have been recycled, pursuant to the IRS normal policy.\\" In September 2014, however, the Treasury Department inspector general reported that it had found 760 tapes from which it later recovered Lerner's emails. On November 24, 2015, Koskinen signed a memorandum that commits the IRS to fostering a model workplace free of conduct that negatively impacts employee engagement and productivity.https://www.irs.gov/irm/part1/irm_01-020-003 =Impeachment proceedings= After the Justice Department notified Congress in October 2015 that there would be no charges against Lois Lerner or anyone else in the IRS, 19 Republican members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee led by the committee's chairman, Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), filed a resolution to impeach Koskinen.\\"House Republicans, in last-ditch effort, move to impeach IRS commissioner over targeting scandal\\", Washington Post, October 28, 2015.Theodore Schleifer and Tom LoBianco, \\"House Republicans move to impeach IRS head\\", cnn.com, October 27, 2015; retrieved October 28, 2015. Those sponsoring the impeachment resolution to remove Koskinen from office accused him of failing to prevent the destruction of evidence in allowing the erasure of backup tapes containing thousands of e-mails written by Lerner, and of making false statements under oath to Congress. In a statement released by the committee, Chaffetz said Koskinen \\"failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress.\\" The IRS declared on October 27 that it did not have an immediate comment on the impeachment resolution. Representative Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland), the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement: \\"This ridiculous resolution will demonstrate nothing but the Republican obsession with diving into investigative rabbit holes that waste tens of millions of taxpayer dollars while having absolutely no positive impact on a single American. Calling this resolution a 'stunt' or a 'joke' would be insulting to stunts and jokes.\\" The resolution was referred to the House Judiciary committee, which held hearings on the matter on May 23 and June 22, 2016. The House leadership decided not to proceed further which led to threats to offer a privileged resolution for impeachment. On December 6, 2016, such a privileged resolution was offered, but the House voted to send the question back to the Judiciary Committee. Personal life Koskinen is married to Patricia Salz and has a daughter, Cheryl, and a son, Jeffery Koskinen. As of June 25, 2014, Koskinen had contributed almost USD $100,000 to Democratic candidates and groups. Legacy Koskinen Stadium at Duke University, which hosts the Duke soccer and lacrosse teams, was named and dedicated in 1999 in honor of the support of John and Patricia Koskinen, who have various foundations.

The term usually refers to oxygenated chemical compounds added to fuels. Oxygenates are usually employed as gasoline additives to reduce carbon monoxide and soot that is created during the burning of the fuel. Compounds related to soot, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrated PAHs, are also reduced. The oxygenates commonly used are either alcohols or ethers: * Alcohols: ** Methanol (MeOH) ** Ethanol (EtOH); see also Common ethanol fuel mixtures ** Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) ** n-Butanol (BuOH) ** Gasoline grade tert-butanol (GTBA) * Ethers: ** Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) ** tert-Amyl methyl ether (TAME) ** tert-Hexyl methyl ether (THEME) ** Ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) ** tert-Amyl ethyl ether (TAEE) ** Diisopropyl ether (DIPE) In the United States In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency had authority to mandate that minimum proportions of oxygenates be added to automotive gasoline on regional and seasonal basis from 1992 until 2006 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, in particular ground-level ozone and smog. In addition to this North American automakers have in 2006 and 2007 promoted a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, marketed as E85, and their flex-fuel vehicles, e.g. GM's Live Green, Go Yellow campaign. U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards give an artificial 54% fuel efficiency bonus to vehicles capable of running on 85% alcohol blends over vehicles not adapted to run on 85% alcohol blends. There is also alcohols' intrinsically cleaner combustion, however due to its lower energy density it is not capable of producing as much energy per gallon as gasoline. Much gasoline sold in the United States is blended with up to 10% of an oxygenating agent. This is known as oxygenated fuel and often (but not entirely correctly, as there are reformulated gasolines without oxygenate) as reformulated gasoline. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was the most common fuel additive in the United States, prior to government mandated use of ethanol.

According to Guppy and Shepard (2001), its specific name phlaeas is said to be derived either from the Greek phlego, \\"to burn up\\" or from the Latin floreo, \\"to flourish\\". Description The upperside forewings are a bright orange with a dark outside edge border and with eight or nine black spots. The hindwings are dark with an orange border. Some females also have a row of blue spots inside the orange border and are known as form caeruleopunctata. The undersides are patterned in a similar way but are paler. The black spots on the forewings are outlined in yellow and the dark colouring is replaced by a pale brownish grey. The hindwings are the same brown/grey colour with small black dots and a narrow orange border. The caterpillars (larvae) are usually green, but some have a purple stripe down the middle of the back and along each side. Small copper (Lycaena phlaeas eleus) ab. caeruleopunctata.jpgmale L. p. eleus ab. caeruleopunctata Oxfordshire, UK Small copper (Lycaena phlaeas) female.jpgfemale L. p. eleus Buckinghamshire, UK Small copper (Lycaena phlaeas phlaeas) male underside autumn brood.jpgL. p. phlaeas male Amarante, Portugal Small copper (Lycaena phlaeas pseudophlaeas) underside.jpgL. p. pseudophlaeas Bale Mountains, Ethiopia Range It is a Holarctic species, widespread and common across Europe, Asia, North America, and also found in North Africa south through to Ethiopia. It can be found almost anywhere in south/central England and Wales although never, it seems, in large numbers. Its distribution becomes more patchy in northern England, Scotland and Ireland. Habitat It is found in a wide variety range of habitats from chalk downlands, heathland, woodland clearings to churchyards and waste ground in cities. Habits In bright sun it is a very active little butterfly with the males setting up small territories which they will defend vigorously against rival males or indeed any unlucky passing insect. Even the shadow of a large bird passing overhead is enough to elicit a response. Females are pursued and mating usually occurs in vegetation. Life cycle The eggs are laid singly and conspicuously on the upperside of food plant leaves and the young caterpillar feeds on the underside of the leaf creating \\"windows\\" by leaving the upper epidermis of the leaf untouched. Pupation takes place in the leaf litter and the pupa is thought to be tended by ants. There are between two and three broods a year, fewer further north. In exceptionally good years, a fourth brood sometimes occurs in the south and adults can still be seen flying into November. The species overwinters as a caterpillar. Image:Lycaena phlaeas egg.jpgEgg Image:Lycaena phlaeas larva.jpgLarva Host plants Depending on the habitat, common sorrel (Rumex acetosa) and sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella) are the two main food plants, although other docks (Rumex species) are occasionally used. Systematics Lycaena phlaeas belongs to the subgenus Lycaena and is the type-species of genus Lycaena. The species is in turn divided into several subspecies, although many probably lack reason to be named, and others may merit an elevation of rank to be considered autonomous species: * L. p. hibernica Goodson, 1948 — Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland * L. p. eleus Fabricius, 1798 — England, Wales, Scotland * L. p. phlaeas Linnaeus, 1761 — Europe, western Siberia, Caucasus, South Caucasus (type locality = Sweden) * L. p. polaris Courvoisier, 1911 — northern Ural Mountains, northern Siberia, Chukotka Peninsula (Russia) * L. p. kamtschatica Gorbunov, 1994 — Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) * L. p. ganalica Gorbunov, 1995 — Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) * L. p. daimio (Seitz, [1909]) — south Kurile Islands, Sakhalin (Russian islands) * L. p. gonpaensis (Yoshino, [2019]) — North Yunnan, China * L. p. hypophlaeas (Boisduval, 1852) — N California Sierra Nevada Mts (Type location) and White Mts.,Boisduval.

The name is a play on the word F-Stop. History The F-Spot project was started by Ettore Perazzoli and is maintained by Stephen Shaw. F-Spot is written in the C# programming language using Mono. Before its shutdown and discontinuation in 2017, F-Spot was the standard image tool for several GNOME based distributions. Even before that, Fedora replaced F-Spot with Shotwell in Fedora 13.4\\\\. Changes in Fedora for Desktop Users Ubuntu has done the same as of 10.10 Maverick Meerkat.http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/05/see-ya-f-spot-shotwell-to-be- default-image-app-in-ubuntu-10-10 There is some new work to update f-spot and potentially bring it to Windows and Mac. Features F-Spot aimed to have an interface that is simple to use but also facilitate advanced features such as tagging images, and displaying and exporting image metadata in Exif and XMP formats. All major photographic image formats are supported, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, DNG, GIF, SVG and PPM, as well as several vendor-specific RAW formats (CR2, PEF, ORF, SRF, CRW, MRW and RAF). As of 2008, the RAW formats were not editable with F-Spot. However, newer releases of F-Spot have the DevelopInUFRaw extension, which calls on UFRaw for the conversion work, and then re-imports the resulting JPEG back into F-Spot as a new version of the original RAW. Photos can be imported directly from the camera. The driver support is provided by libgphoto2. The GNOME desktop environment can also optionally detect if a camera or a memory card has been attached, and import images to F-Spot automatically. Photo CDs can be created by selecting multiple photographs and selecting \\"Export to CD\\" from the main menu. Basic functions such as crop and rotate available alongside more advanced features such as red-eye removal and versioning. The rotate function allows for movements in single degree increments with autocrop, not just 90-degree adjustment. Color adjustments are supported with a histogram. They include an auto-improve and individual brightness, contrast, hue, saturation and temperature. Photos in the F-Spot library can be uploaded to a number of online photo storage sites. F-Spot supports two major gallery sites, Flickr and Picasa Web Albums,F-Spot with PicasaWeb Export and also using stand-alone web gallery software, including Gallery and O.r.i.g.i.n.a.l.Original Photo Gallery F-Spot can also generate static web gallery sites and export to Facebook. F-Spot automatically downsizes photos before exporting to Flickr, and though it describes this as \\"optional,\\" there is no option to not downsize photos before export. Technical information When images are imported into F-Spot, they are written to disk. The folder is \`/username/Pictures/Photos/[year]/[month]/[Day]\`.

It lies about 12 km north of Karlsruhe and is the site of the northern campus of the research centre Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (with the former Forschungsreaktor 2 (FR2). In the west, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen borders on the Rhine River and in the east it is connected with the Bundesstraße 36. The two villages that make up the incorporated municipality evolved from medieval villages specializing in freshwater fishing and farming. Today, gravel extraction for construction purposes is important to the local economy, as is the cultivation of white asparagus (Spargel). Because of its location in the Rhine valley, hot humid summers are the norm for Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen. Numerous public beaches exist on the shores of artificial lakes that have been formed by extensive gravel extraction. Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen has numerous active community associations and sports clubs such as most notably TG Eggenstein 1894 e.V.. Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen is also home to the Sportpark Fassbender, a noted tennis school and training facility.  Economy and Infrastructure  The most important economic factor for Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen is the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), which was formerly founded there in 1956 under the name Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe. This is why the municipality is currently the most important destination for commuters for people living in the nearby city of Karlsruhe. In addition, the municipality has had a balanced municipal budget for years and remains one of the region's plenty debt-free communities. Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen as part of Karlsruhe (district) has one of the lowest unemployment rates in all of Baden-Württemberg with an unemployment rate of approximately around 2.6%. An automobile and pedestrian ferry crossing across the Rhine River runs from Leopoldshafen to Leimersheim. The town is served by routes S1 and S11 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, which is operated by the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft over the Hardtbahn. Seven stops are served, at Eggenstein Süd, Eggenstein Station, Eggenstein Spöcker Weg, Eggenstein Schweriner Strasse, Leopoldshafen Viermorgen, Leopoldshafen Leopoldstrasse and Leopoldshafen Frankfurter Strasse.

L. dispar has been commonly arranged into three subspecies: L. dispar dispar, (single-brooded) which was commonly found in England, but is now extinct, L. d. batavus, (single-brooded) can be found in the Netherlands and has been reintroduced into the United Kingdom, and lastly, L. d. rutilus, (double- brooded) which is widespread across central and southern Europe. The latter has been declining in many European countries, due to habitat loss. Currently L. dispar is in severe decline in northwest Europe, but expanding in central and northern Europe. Native to Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Poland, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. It is regionally extinct in the United Kingdom, due to habitat loss. As well it has been extinct in the British Isles, since the 1860s, with declining numbers occurring across numerous, other western European countries.

Amur, Ussuri. =Subspecies Lycaena dispar batava= The subspecies Lycaena dispar batava is only found in marshy areas in North West Overijssel (the areas Weerribben and Wieden) in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it only feeds on Rumex hydrolapathum, making it a vulnerable subspecies. To protect the subspecies, there is a conservation plan, mainly aimed at expanding its habitat. History Various species of Lepidoptera are described across Europe. Lycaena dispar was first recorded in 1749, from the Huntingdonshire fens, England. Documentation of the large copper was done by the Committee appointed by the Entomological Society of London for the Protection of British Lepidoptera. =Reintroduction= Britain first attempted to reintroduce L. dispar in 1901, when G.H. Verbal released a number of caterpillars in Wicken Fen; however, due to a lack of host plants, the reintroduction was not viable. The first successful reintroduction of the species came in 1913, when W.B. Purefoy, established a colony of L. d. rutilus in Greenfields, Tipperary, a small bog made suitable for L. dispar through the planting of preferred food plants. In 1915, L. d. batavus was described in the Netherlands, despite being almost indistinguishable from extinct L. d. dispar. L. d. batavus populations in Britain, occurred in the fenland area around Whittlesea Mere, extending to Yaxley and Holme Fens, all are characterized by acidic peat bogs, however this population is currently extant. Distribution L. dispar, is widely distributed in central Europe, as far north as southern Finland, extending across temperate Asia to the Amur region and to Manchuria Korea. Occurring throughout much of mainland Europe, L. dispar, is found between 40° and 60° latitudes. =Central Europe= In central Europe L. dispar commonly inhabits drier areas, such as fallows and urban wetlands. =Estonia= L. dispar is one of the newer lepidopteran fauna in Estonia. It was absent from the area up until the 20th century, when it was recorded in 1947, close to the town of Tartu, in the eastern part of Estonia. Over Recent decades the species has remained absent on the islands off the Estonian western coast, scarce in the western regions, and has been expanding into the northwestern part of the country. L. dispar, has been considered univoltine, in Estonia, with a flight time between the end of June and to the end of July. In Estonia the butterfly has two primary host plants, R. crispus and R. obtusifolius. Notably, L. dispar has been considered an expansive species, in Estonia, with the acquired status of a widespread butterfly. As a result, L. dispar is not restricted by habitat requirements, as is common in other populations of L. dispar across Europe. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands populations of L. dispar appear to be more monophagous on R. hydrolapathum. =Germany and Austria= L. dispar is characteristically oligophagous on various Rumex species. England, Ireland and the Netherlands The British subspecies of this butterfly (L. d. dispar) has been extinct since 1864. Most of our knowledge of its life cycle and ecology comes from studies of the similar subspecies (L. d. batava') found in the Netherlands. The species can be identified by the silvery hindwing undersides, from the large specimens of the related, more common, drier habitat species Caena virgaureae and Lycaena hippothoe. Female Egg Habitat L. dispar is a wetland species in decline throughout Europe. The primary habitat of this butterfly has been drained for agricultural and other land usage, limiting their habitat. When it can, L. dispar will utilize plants growing away from watersides and among reed-fen vegetation. In this way L. dispar can avoid possible flooding that can occur in lower lying areas closer to the water's edge. The species prefers undisturbed grasslands along the riverbanks and stream banks, where its larval food plant, the greater water dock, (R. hydrolapathum) can be found. Warmer microclimates, as well as warmer regions in general are preferred by L. dispar, allowing for faster growth time of larvae. Land disturbances through agriculture, primarily the mowing of grass, and other foliage has a negative influence on populations of L. dispar, such that mowing shortly after egg-laying, will result in disastrous losses due to the eggs being destroyed and the newly hatched larvae being deprived of host plants, for food: L. dispar lays its eggs on host food plants, commonly low-lying, with larval migration limited to the area around their birth, host plant. For conservation purposes, it is highly recommended that L. dispar habitats be closely managed, with promotion in increased habitat heterogeneity, being most important: this strategy has proven beneficial for many other species of butterfly. =Host plants= The greater water dock, (Rumex) is host plant of L. dispar, with a broad range of species in the Eastern part of its distribution, and a more limited range of species in its Western distribution. Plant specifications, such as height, size, phonological stages (increase in variables is preferable) and nutrition, as L. dispar is sensitive to its host plants acidity, are all conditions that are taken into consideration when a females chooses host plants to lay her eggs on: these plant will also provide emerging larvae with a source of food. Favourable host plants include R. cripus, the preferred food plant in southwest Germany and Austria, R. obtusifolius, being the preferred food plant in Southwest France, R. patientia, and the lesser common R. hydrolapathum, which is the main food plant in the butterflies northwestern range (Poland and North Germany), where decline in populations has been most severe, and R. stenophyllus. Other commonly distributed Rumex species, that are used by L. dispar are: R. obtusifolius, R. conglomeratus, R. sanguineus, R. aquaticus, R. patientia, and R. stenophyllus. The sorrels, the Rumex species containing oxalic acid, Rumex acetosa, have less commonly been reported as host plants for L. dispar. Life cycle L. dispar has a bivoltine life cycle, throughout most of its European distribution, stretching from May to June, and from the end of July to early September, with peak flight occurring in July. Two generations of L. dispar are standard, the first is characterized by fewer numbers, with the second generation producing more offspring that overwinter, as half-grown, third instar larvae. In the warmer parts (southern distribution) of its European habitat range, L. dispar can be capable of third generations. During the winter months, larvae enter diapause, a period of metabolic inactivity, that is characterized by the development of physiological tolerance to various environmental stressors: cold temperatures, starvation, in order to survive winter conditions. Overwinter survival can be greatly reduced due to flooding for prolonged periods of time, resulting in high mortality of L. dispar larvae in diapause. L. dispar larvae have three characteristic stages: pre-diapause in the autumn, winter diapause and post-diapause in the spring. Heavy mortality is common between oviposition (when females lay their eggs) in the late summer and the resumption of larval feeding in late spring: larvae begin feeding again in early may. In order to enter diapause, L. dispar uses temperature and photoperiodic indicators to determine when to start the overwinter process: entering diapause at low temperatures (<15°C) As well as temperature, environmental and endogenous factors also determine when larvae terminate diapause: generally when ambient temperature is high (>25°C). Females L. dispar females are capable of producing on average 32 chorionated eggs per egg load with an average of 714 eggs being laid in their lifetime. Ovipositing females are specific about the quality of host plant they chose to lay their larvae on with plants preferably lacking flowering or fruiting stems and having inflorescences. Plants that receive greater sunlight allow for larvae to grow faster and develop within a shorter period. Females, for this reason prefer warmer microclimates where host plant conditions are optimal. Notably herbivore leaf damage and fungal infections of host plants, are not significant in reducing egg densities, laid by females. In late June, the L. dispar larvae leave their host, food plant, migrating to vegetation no further than 25cm away from their original host and roughly 10cm above ground. Once there larvae begin to change color, from bright green to pale yellow- brown, allowing them to blend in better with their surroundings during pupation, which lasts between 10 to 14 days. Predation L. dispar is subject to predation from invertebrate species as well as parasitoids (Phryxe vulgaris). During pre-diapause invertebrate predation is responsible for a large proportion of mortality. Parasitoids are commonly found in post-diapause larvae, and results in the death of late, instar larvae. Vertebrate predators often include reed-nesting birds amphibians and small mammals.John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 5 Conservation This species was formerly classified as a priority for protection and re-introduction in the UK under its national Biodiversity Action Plan. The species was driven to extinction in Britain by drainage and consequently great reduction of fen habitat. In the rest of the Western Europe, the draining of wetlands and building and agricultural activity on shallow riverbanks has caused a strong decline. In eastern Europe, undeveloped riverbanks and deltas are a habitat for the species, though even there it is somewhat threatened due increasing human influence on these areas. There have been several reintroduction attempts to sites in both Britain and Ireland, but these have all ultimately failed. This is largely due to L. dispar stock being raised in captivity for long periods of time, before being released into the wild, resulting in adults that are maladapted to their natural environment, and ultimately do not survive. Research is now being conducted to see whether a further attempt is worthwhile in more extensive habitats available in the Great Fen project and the Norfolk Broads. Today, L. dispar is a near threatened species in some regions, leading to a growing concern over its conservation. It is listed in the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, and is protected via Annexes II and IV of the European Community Habitats Directive. In order to boost population numbers, mass rearing would be beneficial, therefore further research is needed to improve survivorship of mass-reared, L. dispar individuals. Conservation efforts need to address the species' high sensitivity to climate and land usage, such as reclamation of wetlands for agricultural purposes and intensive management of grasslands through mowing of vegetation, having a negative influences on population numbers of L. dispar.

He was mortally wounded in a duel with fellow general John S. Marmaduke. Early life and education Lucius Marshall Walker was born in Columbia, Tennessee. He was a nephew of President James K. Polk. Walker graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1850, placing 15th of a class of 44. He was brevetted second lieutenant of dragoons and served on frontier duty in Texas. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1852, shortly before resigning to return to Tennessee, where he established a successful mercantile business. Walker lived in St. Francis County, Arkansas at the time of his enlistment. American Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War, Walker was commissioned Colonel of the 40th Tennessee Volunteer Infantry on November 11, 1861. His first assignment was to command the post at Memphis, Tennessee. In 1862, he and his 40th Tennessee were ordered to New Madrid, Missouri to prepare for the Battle of Island Number Ten. Walker was commissioned brigadier general on March 11, 1862, and was posted at Kentucky Bend, with the command of the 40th Tennessee falling to Lt. Col. C. C. Henderson. He retreated in the face of a much larger Union force, which threatened to capture all of Walker's command. Being forced to surrender at Island #10, Walker was exchanged and rejoined the army at Corinth, Mississippi, before it retreated to Tupelo. At the May 9, 1862, Battle of Farmington, his brigade attacked and drove a Union force from its entrenchments. He was reassigned to the Trans-Mississippi Department on March 23, 1863, commanding a brigade of cavalry under Lt. Gen. Theophilus Holmes at the Battle of Helena. Duel with Marmaduke and death After the Battle of Reed's Bridge on August 26, 1863, Brig. Gen. John S. Marmaduke accused Walker of imperiling Marmaduke's men by being absent from the field in the face of the enemy. Walker, judging from the indications that the enemy was about to flank his position, had withdrawn his troops after dark. Walker felt that he had been unjustly accused of cowardice and challenged Marmaduke to a formal duel. \\"I have not pronounced you a coward,\\" Marmaduke wrote, \\"but I desire to inform you that your conduct as commander of the cavalry was such that I determined no longer to serve you.\\" Maj. Gen. Sterling Price ordered both officers to remain in their quarters in an attempt to prevent the duel. However, by an unfortunate series of mishaps, the orders were not delivered to Walker. At dawn on Sunday, September 6, Walker and Marmaduke squared off with Colt Navy revolvers on the north bank of the Arkansas River near Little Rock. Both fired and missed. Marmaduke then recocked and fired a second time, mortally wounding Walker in the right side, just above the beltline. Walker forgave Marmaduke when the latter offered his assistance. As General Walker lay dying, his wife rode from St. Francis to Little Rock, and gave birth to their son, Lucius Marshall Walker, Jr. Lucius M. Walker died at 5 p.m. the next day. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis. Gen. Frank C. Armstrong married Maria Polk Walker, daughter of Lucius's brother Confederate Col. Joseph Knox Walker. Colonel Walker died on August 21, 1863. See also *List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) References * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1935 as a member of the Progressive Party, and was a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken. McLeod was born in Glen Huron, Ontario, and was educated at Collingwood Collegiate Institute. He worked as a teacher, and continued in this profession after moving to Manitoba in 1902. McLeod served a councillor and reeve in the municipality of Albert, and was active in various farming organizations. He first campaigned for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1920, when he lost by ten votes to Liberal incumbent John Williams in the rural southwestern constituency of Arthur. McLeod ran as an independent farmer candidate, and might have also been endorsed by the local Conservative organization. He later joined the United Farmers of Manitoba. Under its banner, he defeated Williams by 353 votes in the 1922 election. The United Farmers won an unexpected majority in this election, and formed government as the Progressive Party. McLeod was appointed as Manitoba's Provincial Secretary and Municipal Commissioner on August 8, 1922. He gave up the former position on December 3, 1923. McLeod was re- elected in the 1927 election, defeating Conservative challenger J. Arthur Ross by 324 votes. He was retained as Municipal Commissioner, and was appointed Provincial Secretary for a second time on December 31, 1929. On May 27, 1932, he was also appointed as Manitoba's Railway Commissioner. McLeod defeated Ross again in the 1932 election, and was retained in all three cabinet positions. He was still a member of the government at the time of his death in Winnipeg in 1935.

Despite its common name, it is not particularly blue. The male has some bluish suffusion at the base of its upper wings but is mostly dark brown like the female. The species can live in colonies of up to several hundred and in its caterpillar stage is cannibalistic. Description Paratype of subspecies pilyachuch from Kamchatka, in the Natural History Museum, London Small blue males are dark brown with a scattering of bright blue scales that speckle their wings. Females lack this blue speckling. Both males and females exhibit the characteristic silver underside with black spots. The male has a bluish tint at the base of its wings similar to the upper side. Their wingspan can fall anywhere from 16-27mm, but males tend to be the smaller sex. Small blues are often confused with the female Osiris Blue, whose coloring is similar to that of the male small blue. Geographic range C. minimus is found in Europe, Asia Minor, Transcaucasia, Tian-Shan, western Siberia, central Siberia, southern Siberia, the Russian Far East, Amur, Mongolia, Magadan and Kamchatka. =UK and Ireland= The small blue is known for being the smallest butterfly found in the United Kingdom. It has a very patchy distribution across the UK with its strongholds on the chalk and limestone grasslands of southern England such as the Cotswolds and Salisbury Plain. Across the rest of Britain and Ireland it is often associated with coastal habitats with widely scattered colonies in northern England and the far north of Scotland. It is a Priority Species for conservation in Northern Ireland and under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Habitat C. minimus live in calcareous grasslands, abandoned quarries, railway and embankments and woodland edges and clearings.  Food resources  Recorded larval food plants are Oxytropis campestris, Astragalus alpinus, Lotus corniculatus, Anthyllis vulneraria, Melilotus, Coronilla, Medicago, Anthyllis vulneraria, Astragalus glycyphyllos and Astragalus cicer. In the UK, small blues lay their eggs, live, and feed exclusively on the kidney vetch. While females obtain all of their nutrients from plants, males will extract salts and minerals from carrion, dung, and mud puddles. Mating When courting, males will find a perch on a covered piece of grass or shrub while waiting for females. During this period, males are very territorial of their perch. Virgin females flying by will mate with the males without elaborate courtship. Mated females will attempt to avoid other males by waiting in the grasses out of sight when a male is nearby. Oviposition After mating, the female will search for a suitable place to lay a single egg, such as a healthy food plant. Once found, she will lay it between two florets on the flower head in order to keep it mostly hidden, and secure the egg. In order to keep other females from laying eggs on the same flower, the female small blue will rub her abdomen against the florets before she leaves to leave a scent marker. The caterpillars are cannibalistic and will eat one another if multiple hatch on the same flower. However, this scent marker will not last more than a few days, so multiple eggs are often found on a plant. Life cycle Eggs =Ovum= Eggs will typically hatch between one and three weeks, depending on location and temperature. They are .40mm in diameter and .2mm in height. The eggs are light green with white reticulations. =Larvae= First instar Larvae in the 1st instar are typically very pale blue, almost white, with a black head. When the caterpillar first emerges from the egg, it is about .80mm long and will grow to 1.3 mm by the end of the first instar. They have several small hairs along the length of their bodies. Once hatched, the larvae will eat through the calyx of the plant as well as the young green legumes they are typically laid on. The first instar is also cannibalistic, and will feed on any smaller larvae that cross its path.Caterpillar Second instar During the second instar, the caterpillar will grow to about 4mm long. Hairs will begin to grow more densely packed. While the head is still black, the main color is very pale yellow. By this point, the larvae has developed a scent gland on the tenth segment that can be seen pulsing while it moves. Third instar In this stage, the caterpillars will attack and eat one another. It has more hairs even still and is deeper yellow in color. Fourth instar By the fourth instar, the caterpillar is about 1 cm long. They range from pale green to pale yellow, with a dorsal stripe. Come late summer, they will form small cocoons out of silk for hibernation, and will stay motionless for ten months. Their cocoons resemble dead calyces, and thus provide camouflage from predators. =Pupa= The pupa stage can last between 1 and 3 weeks, and is usually temperature dependent. Caterpillars will attach themselves, head up, to the underside of a leaf or blade of grass via a silk cincture that is in turn attached to a silk pad. The pupa is light green in color with brown specks and small hair like structures along the width =Imago= The adult small blue has a lifespan of about three months. In the southern United Kingdom, there are two broods a summer. One is in June, and the other in August with the second brood being smaller. However, in the northern part of the United Kingdom, only the June brood is present. The small blue is diurnal, and often lives in colonies. While most colonies consist of a few dozen individuals, colonies of several hundred have been recorded. Subspecies Cupido minimus trinacriae Verity, 1919 Sicily Conservation status In recent years, the small blue has lost much of its habitat in the United Kingdom, thus making it a Priority Species for conservation in Northern Ireland and under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. It is listed under the 41 species of principal importance under the Schedule 5 of the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act and the 1985 Northern Ireland Wildlife Order. References *Jim Asher et al.

It lies between the Agogna and Terdoppio rivers, in the historical district known as Lomellina, a rice-growing agricultural center. It received the honorary title of city with a royal decree in 1706. History The town has Roman origins proved by several archaeological discoveries and its first name was Pulchra Silva. After the bloody battle during which Charlemagne defeated the Longobard King Desiderius in 773, its name changed. In the Orlando Furioso (second canto) it can be read: > Quivi cader de’ Longobardi tanti, > e tanta fu quivi la strage loro, > che ‘l loco de la pugna gli abitanti > Mortara dapoi sempre nominoro. > > Ludovico Ariosto, I cinque canti - canto II, 88 > The prose translation sounds as follows: > \\"Here so many Longobards died and the slaughter of them was so great here > that, from then on, the inhabitants gave the place of the battle the name of > Mortara\\". It prospered as a hunting place of pastimes thanks to Gian Galeazzo Visconti, who decreed unsuccessfully to change its name into Beldiporto (1384). It was transformed by Charles V into a fortress called «The Star» and in 1658 was besieged by the French-Piedmontese Army led by Francesco d'Este. It was restituted to Spain and remained a Spanish possession until 1706, when it was annexed to the Savoy Kingdom. In the same year it became the capital of the Province of Lomellina. On March 21, 1849 it was the site of a bloody Austro- Piedmontese battle just before the defeat of Novara. Mortara is now an agricultural center of national importance for its rice production, but it is also an interesting and tasty gastronomical destination thanks to the goose sausages and products. Main sights *San Lorenzo, Mortara: Gothic basilica with brick façade, was built (1375-1380) by Bartolino da Novara and renovated in 1840 and 1916. Two 15th-century tondoes are found outside the main entrance. The pilaster strips depict SS. Albin, Amìcus and Amelius; these are 19th-century copies of a 15th-century polyptych by Paolo da Brescia, previously found in the Church of St Albin and now conserved in Sabauda Gallery. Inside the church, to the right of the entrance, in the first span is a 15th-century fresco depicting the Virgin with Her Child; in the 2nd span Virgin between Saints Roch and Sebastian (1524) attributed to Gaudenzio Ferrari. In the first chapel is housed a panel by Bernardo Lanino, dated 1578 and representing The Lady of the Rosary crowned by 15 tablets by the same author illustrating the fifteen mysteries of the Rosary. The niche is completed by four canvasses by G. C. Procaccini representing the Archangel and Our Lady of the Annunciation, The Escape from Egypt and The rest of the Holy Family, in addition to a Glory in Paradise attributed to Camillo Procaccini. In the second chapel, above the altar, is a Crucifixion with Ss. Ambrogius, Laurentius and Mary the Magdalen (1610) by Giovanni Battista Crespi (il Cerano). Left aisle, first chapel - Here we can find a magnificent wooden Christmas crib with about 80 low relieved figures (beginnings of the fifteenth century) by Lorenzo da Mortara. A St Charles in prayer and Ste Anne with Virgin attributed to Morazzone. Second chapel - There is the fifteenth-century polyptych on a six-parted table, a work by A. De Munini. *Santa Croce: founded in 1080, outside the walls under the patronage of Pope Gregorius VII; after town expanded, rebuilt by Tibaldi in 1596. Repairs in 1960s altered decoration. In the pilaster strip dividing 1st and 2nd chapels is an indentation in Carrara marble said to be a footprint of the Christ retrieved from the Holy Land during the Crusades. The 3rd chapel on the right hosts a Adoration of the Magi (1533) by Bernardino Lanino. The 4th chapel houses a Saint Michael by Guglielmo Caccia (Il Moncalvo). In the counterfaçade there are two watercolours (1545) depict a Virgin of Annunciation and Archangel Gabriel, attributed to Vigevanese Bernardino Ferrari. The 4th chapel on the left houses a Virgin with Child and Saints by the 16th-century Venetian school and a 15th-century fresco representing Saint Augustin. *Santa Maria del Campo, located about west of Mortara, near road to Novara. Founded in 1145, now has Lombard-Gothic layout of the hall churches, typical of Lomellina. Houses works attributed to Giovanni Battista Crespi (il Cerano). The main altar has a fresco depicting a Glory of Angels-Musicians, attributed to Cerano. *Sant'Albino, Mortara, one of the Christian «mother-churches» of the 5th century Lomellina, re-used by Charlemagne as a burial ground for the numerous soldiers who fell in the battle between the Lombard and the Frank armies, on October 12, 773. Among the casualties there were also two paladins of Charlemagne's, Amelius of Alvernia and Amicus from Beyre, whose death inspired a lot of French chansons de geste. In 774 the famous abbott Alkwin Albin added a canonical college to the Church. During the Middle Ages Sant'Albino was a compulsory halting-piace for the pìlgrims going from Britain and France to Rome. The architectural style developed from an originai mingling of the Romanesque style, clearly recognizable in the apse, with the Renaissance style, to be found in the façade and in the nave. Against the southern side of the portico of the façade, is a building, perhaps a part of the ancient monastery. Beside the church, there are the ruins of the cloister, a brick open gallery with wooden architraves and with a 14th-century Gothic window decorated with rural motives. In the interior, on the right wall, are three frescoes painted by Giovanni da Milano in 1410 and representing Abbott St Anthony, The Baptism of Jesus, Enthroned Virgin with Saints Albin, Jacob, St. Augustine and Donor. Another fresco, by an unknown painter working during the first half of the 15th century, can be seen under the triptych, representing St. Laurentius with the symbol of his martyrdom in his hand. Next to this fresco are located some visible marks carved in the bricks by the pilgrims to remember their passage: the most ancient readable date is the year 1100. Another anonymous fresco is on the left part of the presbytery and represents a Virgin with Child and Saints.

He traced his lineage to a certain marquis whose family name was \\"Kou\\" (). He was also related to the House of Liu – the imperial clan of the Han dynasty from which Liu Bei descended – albeit not directly. He served as a general in his adoptive father's military forces. Life Liu Feng was a descendant of the Marquis of Luo (), whose family name was Kou (). He was also related (but not directly) to the Liu () family of Changsha (長沙; around present-day Changsha, Hunan), who descended from Liu Fa (), one of Emperor Jing's sons. When Liu Bei seized control of four commanderies – Changsha, Lingling (), Guiyang (), Wuling () – in southern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) in 209, he adopted Liu Feng as his son because he had no suitable heir at the time. In 211, Liu Bei led an army from Jing Province to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), ostensibly to help Yi Province's governor Liu Zhang counter a rival warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. When war broke out between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang in the following year, Liu Feng, then in his early 20s and famous for his combat skills and great physical strength, led forces from Jing Province together with Liu Bei's other followers to assist his foster father in the Yi Province campaign. Liu Zhang surrendered to Liu Bei in 214, after which Yi Province came under Liu Bei's control. Liu Bei appointed Liu Feng as a Vice-General of the Household ().(劉封者，本羅侯寇氏之子，長沙劉氏之甥也。先主至荊州，以未有繼嗣，養封為子。及先主入蜀，自葭萌還攻劉璋，時封年二十餘，有武藝，氣力過人，將兵俱與諸葛亮、張飛等泝流西上，所在戰克。益州旣定，以封為副軍中郎將。) Sanguozhi vol. 40. In 219, Liu Bei ordered his general Meng Da to lead an army from Zigui County to attack Fangling County (房陵縣; present-day Fang County, Hubei), which was defended by Kuai Qi (). Meng Da defeated Kuai Qi in battle, conquered Fangling County, and then proceeded to attack Shangyong Commandery (上庸郡; around present-day Zhushan County, Hubei). Liu Bei was worried that Meng Da could not manage alone, so he sent Liu Feng to lead a force from Hanzhong Commandery and sail down the Mian River () to rendezvous with Meng Da at Shangyong. Shen Dan (), the Administrator of Shangyong, surrendered to Meng Da and Liu Feng. For his achievement, Liu Feng was promoted to Vice-General (). Later that year, when Liu Bei's general Guan Yu led an army from Jing Province to attack an enemy garrison at Fan (樊; or Fancheng, present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), he repeatedly asked Meng Da and Liu Feng to lead reinforcements from Shangyong to support him but they refused, claiming that the situation in Shangyong was not stable yet. Eventually, Guan Yu not only failed to conquer Fan, but also lost his lord's territories in Jing Province in a stealth invasion by Liu Bei's ally Sun Quan, who had turned against Liu. Guan Yu was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces. Liu Bei resented Liu Feng and Meng Da for not aiding Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Feng had a quarrel with Meng Da. Meng Da became afraid when he heard of Liu Bei's anger towards him and was also worried about his dispute with Liu Feng, so he brought along his followers and defected to the state of Cao Wei, which was established by Liu Bei's rival Cao Pi.(建安二十四年，命達從秭歸北攻房陵，房陵太守蒯祺為達兵所害。達將進攻上庸，先主陰恐達難獨任，乃遣封自漢中乘沔水下統達軍，與達會上庸。上庸太守申耽舉衆降， ... 遷封為副軍將軍。自關羽圍樊城、襄陽，連呼封、達，令發兵自助。封、達辭以山郡初附，未可動搖，不承羽命。會羽覆敗，先主恨之。又封與達忿爭不和，封尋奪達鼔吹。達旣懼罪，又忿恚封，遂表辭先主，率所領降魏。) Sanguozhi vol. 40. After defecting to Wei, Meng Da wrote a letter to Liu Feng, in which he attempted to persuade Liu Feng to join him by noting two important points: Liu Bei already had other sons at the time so he no longer regarded Liu Feng as highly as before; the Wei imperial court was willing to allow Liu Feng to inherit the Luo marquisate which belonged to his biological family. Liu Feng ignored Meng Da's advice and returned to his foster father. Liu Bei reproached his adoptive son for not helping Guan Yu and blamed him for Meng Da's defection. Liu Bei's chancellor, Zhuge Liang pointed out Liu Feng's martial prowess and expressed worries that Liu Feng might become a threat to them if he switched his allegiance to their enemies, hence he urged his lord to eliminate Liu Feng. Liu Bei eventually condemned Liu Feng to death but permitted him to take his own life. Before committing suicide, Liu Feng said, \\"I regret not listening to Meng Da!\\" Liu Bei shed tears after Liu Feng died.(達與封書曰：[...] 封不從達言。 ... 封旣至，先主責封之侵陵達，又不救羽。諸葛亮慮封剛猛，易世之後終難制御，勸先主因此除之。於是賜封死，使自裁。封嘆曰：「恨不用孟子度之言！」先主為之流涕。) Sanguozhi vol. 40. Liu Feng's son, Liu Lin (), was appointed as an Officer of the Standard () and served in the state of Shu Han – founded by Liu Bei in 221 – in the Three Kingdoms period throughout the reign of Liu Bei's eldest son and successor, Liu Shan. In 264, after the fall of Shu, Liu Lin was ordered to move out of former Shu territory to Hedong Commandery.(封子林為牙門將，咸熙元年內移河東。) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 40. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong, Liu Feng was adopted after Liu Shan was born, which proved controversial because Liu Bei already had a biological son at the time who was far younger than Liu Feng. Guan Yu, in particular, voiced his opposition, citing the family feud between Liu Biao's sons. However, Liu Feng showed his worth in battle and proved to be a valuable asset to his foster father. In 219, when Guan Yu was being surrounded by Sun Quan's forces in Maicheng (), Liu Feng refused to provide reinforcements partly because Meng Da reminded Liu Feng of Guan Yu's disapproval. When the general Liao Hua told Liu Bei that Guan Yu died because Liu Feng and Meng Da did not send reinforcements, Liu Bei began to resent the two and even plotted their arrest. Meng Da became afraid and defected to the state of Cao Wei and sent Liu Feng a message, urging him to defect as well. In anger, Liu Feng executed the messenger and went to battle Meng Da, who was now aided by the Wei generals Xu Huang and Xiahou Shang. As Liu Feng was out of the city, the defender Shen Dan surrendered to Wei and shot arrows at Liu Feng's men. Defeated, Liu Feng returned to Chengdu with only slightly more than a hundred horsemen. Liu Feng sought an interview with Liu Bei, but gained scant sympathy. In response to Liu Feng's petition, Liu Bei instructed the executioners to expel Liu Feng and put him to death. Liu Bei felt some regret later when he heard of Liu Feng's staunch rejection of Meng Da's enticement. This, adding to the recent death of Guan Yu, made Liu Bei grieve until he fell sick.

The player controls a vast array of units ranging from infantry, armoured divisions and aircraft, completing missions through a mixture of unit management and strategic planning. In the game's story, the player operates as a commander of a battalion, who initially take part in a conflict between two nations that culminates in an eventual alliance between them, in response to a surprise attack by a third nation. The game received generally favorable reviews upon release, and led to the creation of a sequel, entitled Battalion Wars 2, for the Wii in 2007.  Community  Over 10 years after the games release there remains an online community of people whom aim to modify the game's source code to create playable \\"mods\\". To play online games using auxiliary third party servers, and to generally discuss the game and its development. Gameplay The game features only a single-player campaign, played from a third-person perspective, in which players take control of a variety of units that form a battalion, to complete a series of missions. Gameplay features a mixture of elements from both third-person shooters and real-time tactics games. In each mission, players complete a series of objectives, both primary and secondary, earning a rank depending on the final score they achieve, much like in Advance Wars, determined in three categories - Power is determined by how many enemy units were destroyed in the mission; Technique is determined by how many of the player's units survived; and Speed is determined by how long it took the player to complete a mission, against the mission's Par time. While the campaign's missions focus primarily on controlling forces from one of the game's four factions, bonus missions are unlocked if the player achieves an average score for a set of missions, allowing them to take control of troops from one of the other four factions. For each mission, the player is given a variety of units to utilise, including infantry, armoured vehicles, and aircraft (with the exception of Air Transports), in which the number and types that can be used vary between missions; more troops can be earned as reinforcements depending on the player's progress in a mission or from capturing POW camps and helipads. While one single unit is controlled fully by the player, whom the camera focuses primarily on, the rest are given orders by the player that range from following them, moving to a location, holding ground, or guarding another unit, to attacking enemy units and structures. Players can give orders to the whole battalion, a company of the same units, or individual units, allowing for flexibility and strategic planning for upcoming engagements, depending on a given situation (i.e. defending a location). While the camera is focused on the player's unit, it can be freely switched between an over-the-shoulder viewpoint, to a battlefield overview viewpoint. The in-game HUD comprises a mini-radar that denotes the location of objectives, and units - friendly, allies, and hostile - along with the battalion bar at the bottom, which lists the units and the number in a company that the player has. In addition to the HUD, the player can also pause the game to review Mission Logs, Objectives, and view the map of the mission's battlefield, allowing them to locate the position of units and current objectives. Units featured in the game are based on those from the Advance Wars series, though Battalion Wars features unique units, including: light and heavy recon units; a wider variety of infantry units that cover basic riflemen, to units specialised against particular units (i.e. anti-air), and long-range mortar companies; \\"battlestation\\" tanks; and \\"stratodestroyer\\" aircraft. Units function similarly to their counterparts in Advance Wars, though with some differences. Infantry units can use cover to reduce the threat of enemy fire, can man mounted gun emplacements, and can be healed individually by collecting first aid kits dropped by eliminated enemy infantry. Furthermore, some objectives require players to take control of certain points (represented as flags), which only infantry can capture. Vehicle and air units, along with their primary weapons and abilities, have manned machine guns that work autonomously against enemy units, and can be repaired by picking up jerry cans dropped by destroyed enemy vehicles. With the exception of ground vehicles, players gain additional controls when taking full control of an infantry unit, allowing them to jump over obstacles and dodge enemy fire by rolling to the side, while taking control of an air unit allows them to adjust its altitude in order to avoid enemy fire. Plot =Setting= The game's world consists of five nations, spread across two large continents and a series of islands and archipelagos. The western continent consists of a mixture of rugged canyons in the west and wide plains and forests, to frozen tundra and snowy mountains and forested valleys in the east. The continent is shared between the Western Frontier in the west, based upon the United States and whom the player controls throughout the campaign, and the Tundran Territories in the east, based upon Russia. The eastern continent consists of a desert province in the west, called the Dune Sea, and a large gothic-themed landscape in the east, which is home to the nation of Xylvania, a country based on a mixture of pre-World War I Germany, modern Romania, vampires, and Gothic themes. The southern seas consist of several islands, including a large archipelago to the south of the western continent, which is home to the Solar Empire, a nation based upon Japan with a mixture of traditional Japanese and high-tech futuristic themes. =Characters= The game's main protagonists are the commanding officers of the Western Frontier - General Herman, the leader of the Frontier forces; Colonel Austin, a resourceful officer; and Brigadier Betty, a young, energetic woman, whose uniform is based on a cheerleaders outfit. Leading the Tundran Territories are its officers - Tsar Gorgi, the country's former ruler who believes in strength; Marshall Nova, Gorgi's son and successor, devoted to modern progress and peace; and Major Nelly, an experienced female officer. leading the Solar Empire is its ruler, Empress Lei-Qo - a wise woman with mystical powers. Their main antagonists are the commanding officers of Xylvania - Kaiser Vlad, the country's ruler; Kommandant Ubel, a hulking monster of a man; and Countess Ingrid, a devoted female pilot veteran. =Story= Following a previous war between the Western Frontier and Tundran Territories, both sides maintain an uneasy truce with each other, while maintaining a constant vigil of each other's forces at the demilitarized zone along their borders. General Herman, head of the Frontier's armies, agrees to a suggestion made by his subordinate, Brigadier Betty, to hold a military exercise for their troops to ensure they remain fit for duty. During the exercise, a recon scout spots several Tundran armored divisions invading their territories at the command of Tsar Gorgi. Having recently been succeeded by his son Marshal Nova as the country's new political and military leader, Gorgi despised the promise of peace between the two nations and decided to strengthen his nation's might by secretly invading and defeating the Frontier, effectively ending the truce between the two nations. Learning of his father's actions, Nova forbids Gorgi from participating further in the war he started, determined to end the conflict himself with his second-in-command, Major Nelly, leading Tundran forces. As the Frontier forces begin to start winning the conflict, defeating Tundran forces in a series of battles, Gorgi travels to Xylvania, a country that had been ravaged by the rivalry of the two nations, to form a pact with its leader Kaiser Vlad. However, Vlad betrays him by having bombers, commanded by his subordinate Countess Ingrid, attack both armies. Horrified by this, Gorgi goes into exile out of shame for his actions. Weakened after the Xylvanian assault, both Herman and Nova call a ceasefire between their armies, effectively ending the conflict. Both nations decide to join forces, forming the Alliance of Nations, in order to retaliate against the Xylvanians as they prepare to attack both countries. Seeking to weaken their enemies, the Alliance conducts operations within the Dune Sea, in order to prevent their enemies from drilling for nerocite, an essential resource used as vehicle fuel. Despite difficulties in their final battle, the Alliance is aided by Gorgi, after he comes out of exile to assist in the conflict in his own personal fighter. Although the Xylvanians are driven out for good, Gorgi is mortally wounded by Vlad's right-hand man Kommandant Ubel. Before dying, Gorgi apologizes to Nova for his actions, leaving his son to vow for revenge for his father's death. Learning that the Xylvanians seek to invade the Solar Empire, Colonel Austin, a Frontier officer, has the Alliance make contact with its leader, Empress Lei-Qo, in order to offer assistance in repelling Vlad's invasion, in exchange for her assistance in invading Xylvania. As the Alliance begins invading into Xylvanian territory, Ingrid decides to take action to stop the invasion. Stealing an ancient sword from Vlad, Ingrid uses it to awaken the country's ancient army, known as the Iron Legion. In doing so, Ingrid is driven insane by the Legion's power, causing her to attack both the Alliance and Xylvanian forces. Finding themselves forced to stop the Legion, the Alliance fights towards the Legion's source of power, the Cenotaph, and destroy it. In the wake of its destruction, Lei-Qo arrives and kills Ingrid, ending her madness and the threat of the Legion. Following the conflict, the Alliance finally reaches the Xylvanian capital of Vladstag, and defeat the last remaining forces guarding it. Although Vlad escapes, the Alliance captures Ubel, imprisoning him. With the Xylvanians defeated, the Alliance celebrates the end of the war, though Nova points out to Betty that his father left him a parting lesson - in order for him to strive for peace, he must be prepared for war.  Development  The game was originally titled Advance Wars: Under Fire during development and was originally planned to be tie into the Advance Wars series of games. However, its concept never intended to have this connection in mind, and because of its otherwise unrelated gameplay elements and storyline, the title was ultimately changed for Western release to avoid connections to the Advance Wars branding, while the Japanese version was released under the Famicom Wars branding. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40. X-Play complemented the game's emphasis on strategy and third person shooting as well as its cartoonish art style while criticizing the sometimes clunky controls and lack of multiplayer. Sequel There is a sequel to Battalion Wars, titled Battalion Wars 2 for the Nintendo Wii, with a storyline that continues shortly after where the original Battalion Wars leaves off. The sequel delves further into the backstory and includes more territories, along with introducing new land, air, and sea vehicles for the players to utilize.

Other accounts The earliest mention of Trieu Thi Trinh can be found in the \\"Jiaozhou Ji\\"(交州记) written in the Jin dynasty, and collected in the Taiping Yulan *《太平御览 卷371 ◎人事部十二 ○乳》引刘欣期《交州记》曰：赵妪者，九真军安县女子也。乳长数尺，不嫁，入山聚群盗，遂攻郡。常着金扌翕，踪屐，战退辄张帷幕，与少男通，数十侍侧。刺史吴郡陆胤平之。 *《太平御览 卷499 ◎人事部一百四十 ○盗窃》引刘欣期《交州记》曰：赵妪者，乳长数尺，不嫁，入山聚群盗。遂北郡常着金蹋踶，战退辄张帷幕，与少男通，数十侍侧。刺史陆胤平之。 *《太平御览 卷698 ◎服章部十五○屐》引刘欣期《交州记》曰：赵妪者，九贞军安县女子，乳长数尺，不嫁。入山聚群盗，常着金擒踶屐。 *《太平御览 卷811 ◎珍宝部十○金下》引刘欣期《交州记》曰：赵妪者，九真人，乳长数尺。入山聚盗，遂攻郡。常着金擒提屐。. In the book Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945 written by David G. Marr, an American Professor, told the story of Trieu Thi Trinh as follow: Trieu Thi Trinh was a woman who had breasts. She also had a voice which sounded like a temple bell, and she could eat many rice pecks and walk 500 leagues per day. Moreover, Trinh had a beauty that could shake any man's soul. Because of repeated altercations, she killed her sister and went to a forest in which she gathered a small army and attacked the Chinese. When her brother tried to persuade her from rebelling, she told him: > I only want to ride the wind and walk the waves, slay the big whales of the > Eastern sea, clean up frontiers, and save the people from drowning. Why > should I imitate others, bow my head, stoop over and be a slave? Why resign > myself to menial housework? After hearing Trinh's words, her brother decided to join her. At first the Chinese underestimated Trinh for her being a female leader but after some encounters, they feared her because of her gaze. Three centuries later, she still offered spiritual support for male Vietnamese opponent of the Chinese. In the Lý dynasty she was honored by the court with a lot of posthumous titles. During the Lê dynasty, Neo-Confucianism became Vietnam's national ideology and many scholars aggressively tried to bring the practices of Trieu Thi Trinh into conformity with Neo-Confucianism. Nevertheless, she survived all their manipulations. Historical differences Most available information comes solely from Vietnamese sources that were written during or after the late Ming dynasty. However, the Sanguozhi (Records of the Three Kingdoms), a classical Chinese historical account, does mention a rebellion at this time in the commanderies of Jiaozhi (交趾; Vietnamese: Giao Chỉ) and Jiuzhen (九真, Vietnamese: Cửu Chân): > “In the 11th year of Chiwu (赤烏) [248] in Jiaozhi (交趾), Jiuzhen (九真) rebels > attacked walled cities which caused a great uproar. Lu Yin (陸胤) [of Hengyang > (衡陽) ] was given rank of the Inspector of Jiaozhou by the Sovereign of Wu. > He took his troops and entered the southern border and sent word to the > rebels. He used his craftiness to convince them to accept his terms. [In] > Gaoliang (高涼), the commander Huang Wu (黄吳) with 3,000 households came out to > surrender. Lu Yin now led the army south to that region. He announced his > sincerity [to the aborigines] and distributed gifts. The [remaining] 100 > rebel leaders and 50,000 households, who had been unruly and unapproachable, > kowtowed [to Lu Yin]. Thus the territory was handed over peacefully. At once > Lu Yin was given the rank of General who Tranquilizes the South. Again he > was sent on a punitive expedition against the rebels in Cangwu (蒼梧). He > defeated them quickly. From start to finish Lu Yin's military troops totaled > 8,000. (Later commentaries also cited that Lu Yin then helped to plant crops > and kept the people fed.)” Keith W. Taylor, an American professor, explained these differences as following: > “Chinese records do not mention Lady Trieu; our knowledge of her comes only > from Vietnamese sources. From this it is evident that the events of 248 were > remembered differently by the two sides. The Chinese only recorded their > success in buying off certain rebel leaders with bribes and promises. The > resistance led by Lady Trieu was for them simply a kind of stubborn > barbarism that was wiped out as a matter of course and was of no historical > interest. On the other hand, the Vietnamese remembered Lady Trieu's uprising > as the most important event of the time. Her leadership appealed to strong > popular instincts. The traditional image of her as a remarkable yet human > leader, throwing her yard-long breasts over her shoulders when going into > battle astride an elephant, has been handed down from generation to > generation. After Lady Trieu's death, her spirit was worshipped by the > Vietnamese. We owe our knowledge of her to the fact that she was remembered > by the people.” Legacy Triệu Thị Trinh is a greatly celebrated hero and many streets are named after her in Vietnamese cities (there are Bà Triệu streets in Huế, Hà Nội, Ho Chi Minh City, and several other cities).

As manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers (1947; 1948–50), he won two National League pennants and served as Jackie Robinson's first permanent Major League manager. Playing career: Fleet-of-foot outfielder Shotton was born in Brownhelm, a township in Lorain County, Ohio. In his playing days, he was a speedy outfielder — he was nicknamed \\"Barney\\" after race car driver Barney Oldfield — who batted left-handed and threw right-handed. The , Shotton compiled a .271 batting average with 1,338 hits in 1,387 Major League games played for the St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators and St. Louis Cardinals (1909; 1911–23). Although he stole over 40 bases in four consecutive seasons (1913–16), he was also caught stealing over 26 times in each of those seasons. In an American League dominated by speedsters such as Ty Cobb and Clyde Milan, Shotton was never among the top five base stealers in the league, and he had a high rate of being caught stealing, but he pilfered 294 bases during his MLB career. His real talent, however, may be shown in his on-base percentage, in which he finished in the top ten in the league four times in his career. He twice (in 1913 and 1916) led AL batters in walks,McMillan's Baseball Encyclopedia, 10th edition. and finished in the top ten six seasons.https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/s/shottbu01.shtml In the early 1920s, as a player and coach, he was the Cardinals' \\"Sunday manager\\", relieving skipper Branch Rickey, who always observed the Christian Sabbath. Rickey and Shotton had formed a longstanding friendship and professional relationship dating back to their years together (1913–15) with the Browns, when Rickey was his manager. After Shotton retired as a player, he was on the Cardinals' coaching staff from 1923–25Retrosheet until he took over as manager of their top farm club, the Syracuse Stars of the International League, in 1926–27.http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/the-story-of-kindly-old- burt-shotton/ Baptism of fire in Philadelphia Shotton's first formal Major League managing opportunity came with the NL's then-habitual tailending team, the Philadelphia Phillies. He lasted six seasons (1928–33) with the Phils, who twice lost more than 100 games during his tenure. The Shotton-era Phillies included two notable teams. The 1930 edition compiled a team batting average of .315 (paced by Chuck Klein's .386 and Lefty O'Doul's .383) and scored 944 runs; but the Phillie pitching staff allowed 1,199 runs and posted a horrendous 6.71 earned run average as the team finished last, at 52–102.ESPN.com Then, only two years later, the 1932 club compiled a 78–76 record, good enough for fourth place in the National League. It would be the Phillies' only winning season and first-division finish between 1917 and . Altogether, Shotton's win-loss mark in Philadelphia was 370–549 (.403). Shotton then coached for the Cincinnati Reds in 1934. On July 28, he had a one-game stint as interim manager after the firing of Bob O'Farrell and before new skipper Chuck Dressen arrived from Nashville to take command of the last- place Reds; in that game, Cincinnati defeated the Chicago Cubs, 11–2.Retrosheet: The 1934 Cincinnati Reds Then Shotton returned to the Cardinals for a seven-year term (1935–41) managing their top-level Rochester Red Wings and Columbus Red Birds farm clubs, and spent four years (1942–45) on the coaching staff of player-manager Lou Boudreau of the Cleveland Indians. But prior to the season, Shotton hung up his uniform and settled into a scouting role for the Brooklyn Dodgers, for whom Rickey was now part-owner, president and general manager. A stand-in for Durocher On the eve of the 1947 season, Shotton received a telegram from Rickey; it read: \\"Be in Brooklyn in the morning. Call nobody, see no one\\". Flying immediately from his Florida home to New York, not knowing what to expect, Shotton was ushered into Rickey's presence. Leo Durocher, the Dodgers' manager since 1939, had been suspended for the entire 1947 campaign by Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler for \\"conduct detrimental to baseball.\\" In his search for a temporary replacement, Rickey had been rebuffed by former New York Yankees manager Joe McCarthy, then in retirement, and two of Durocher's coaches, Clyde Sukeforth (who managed the first two games of the season on an emergency basis) and Ray Blades. Rickey pleaded with Shotton to take over the Dodgers for the remainder of the season. Then 62, and convinced that his on-field career was over, Shotton reluctantly took the reins on April 18, still in street clothes. (Shotton was one of the last baseball managers to wear everyday apparel rather than the club uniform. Unlike Connie Mack, however, he did usually add his team's cap and jacket.) He inherited a contending Brooklyn team that had finished in a flatfooted tie for the National League pennant before losing a playoff series to the Cardinals. He also inherited what historian Jules Tygiel called Baseball's Great Experiment — the Dodgers' breaking of the infamous color line by bringing up Jackie Robinson from their Triple-A Montreal Royals farm club at the start of the 1947 season to end over sixty years of racial segregation in baseball. The rookie was facing withering insults from opposing players, and a petition by Dodger players protesting Robinson's presence had only recently been quashed by Durocher. Shotton's calm demeanor, however, provided the quiet leadership the Dodgers needed.Barber, Red (1982). 1947: When All Hell Broke Loose in Baseball. Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Co. . pp. 213–228 They won the National League pennant by five games, and took the New York Yankees to seven games in the 1947 World Series. In Game 4, Shotton helped to thwart Bill Bevens' no-hit bid in the ninth inning, sending into the game two pinch hitters and two pinch runners in an attempt to overcome a 2–1 deficit. The gambit worked, as Dodger pinch hitter Cookie Lavagetto drove home both pinch runners, Al Gionfriddo and Eddie Miksis, with his opposite-field double — Brooklyn's only hit — for a 3–2 victory.Retrosheet With Durocher's suspension over, Shotton retired again, this time to a front office post as \\"managerial consultant\\" in the Dodgers' vast farm system. But the 1948 Dodgers did not respond to Durocher's return; they even (briefly, on May 24) fell into the NL cellar. Durocher was still under siege by the Catholic Youth Organization because of his extramarital relationship with, and then quick marriage to, actress Laraine Day. Return to Brooklyn's bench With the New York Giants also floundering, owner Horace Stoneham decided to replace his manager, Mel Ott, with Shotton. He called Rickey to ask permission to speak with Shotton about the Giants' job, and was stunned when Rickey offered him the opportunity to hire Durocher instead.Durocher, Leo, with Linn, Ed, Nice Guys Finish Last. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1975 On July 16, 1948, Durocher moved from Brooklyn to Upper Manhattan to take over the Giants. The following day, Shotton was back in the Dodger dugout — still in street clothes. On that day, Brooklyn was 37–37 and in fourth place, 8 games behind the Boston Braves. After his return, the Dodgers rallied to take the lead in the 1948 NL standings by the end of August, before they faltered in September to finish third, 7 games behind Boston. Then, in , Shotton won his second pennant, with Brooklyn capturing 97 regular-season victories to finish a game ahead of the Cardinals. Robinson won the National League's Most Valuable Player award and batting championship. But Brooklyn again bowed to the Yankees in the World Series, this time in only five games. Despite Shotton's two pennants in three seasons, he continually faced criticism from Durocher loyalists on the Dodgers, who claimed that Shotton was a poor game strategist and lacked Durocher's competitive intensity. Because he eschewed wearing a uniform, Shotton was prohibited from stepping onto the field of play during games to argue with umpires and make pitching changes; those tasks fell to one of his uniformed coaches.Spatz, Lyle, The People's Choice. SABR Shotton also had severe critics within the press, notably New York Daily News baseball writer Dick Young, who came to refer to him in print only by the derisive acronym KOBS, short for \\"Kindly Old Burt Shotton.\\" Shotton's poor relationship with the New York media partly was self-inflicted: according to author Roger Kahn, he attempted to ban Young from the Brooklyn clubhouse, and alienated and infuriated the New York Herald-Tribunes Harold Rosenthal by repeatedly addressing him as \\"Rosenberg\\" and \\"Rosenbloom.\\" In 1950, despite chronic pitching woes, Shotton guided the Dodgers to within a game of first place on the final day of the season. But Dick Sisler's tenth-inning home run off Don Newcombe won the pennant for the Phillies' \\"Whiz Kids\\", and ended both the Dodger season and Shotton's managerial career. Rickey was forced from the Brooklyn front office by new majority owner Walter O'Malley at the end of October. At his home in Bartow, Florida, Shotton ignored O'Malley's repeated suggestions that he fly to Brooklyn to \\"discuss [his] future\\", declaring, \\"I don't intend to go all the way up there just to be fired.\\" Indeed, O'Malley had already decided on Chuck Dressen as his new manager; his hiring was formally announced November 28. In contrast to Shotton, the fiery Dressen would be conspicuous on the field wearing uniform No. 7 and doubling as Brooklyn's third-base coach.Stewart, Mark, Chuck Dressen. SABR biography project In retirement Shotton's last connection with baseball was as a consultant for Rickey's Continental League, the planned \\"third major league\\" that ultimately forced expansion of MLB in 1961–62. In 1960, Rickey, the CL president, engaged Shotton to assist and supervise the managers in the Western Carolinas League, a Class D minor league originally set up to groom talent for the CL. Shotton died in Lake Wales, Florida, from a heart attack at age 77 during the second All-Star break in 1962. Although his career win-loss record as a big league manager was 697–764 (.477), his mark with the Dodgers was 326–215 (.603). According to an informal study by researchers at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the last manager to wear street clothes is believed to be Shotton, who last managed a game on Sunday, October 1, 1950.Major League Baseball's Worst Idea (Connie Mack, who famously wore a full suit during his 50 years as manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, also retired on October 1, 1950, but his game that day ended earlier.)Baseball Reference In popular culture In the 2013 film 42, Shotton is played by Max Gail.

The album was recorded in a style which drew on the club culture and house music of the time, but also incorporates the group's characteristic love of 1960s pop, with tracks also bridged by samples from films or by short songs. At the time of recording, Sarah Cracknell was not fully part of the group, and as a result she does not sing on \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\", which is sung by Moira Lambert. Foxbase Alpha was on the short list of nominees for the 1992 Mercury Prize. It was accompanied by several successful singles, including \\"Nothing Can Stop Us.\\" Songs The album includes one of the group's best-known songs: a cover of Neil Young's \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\". The cover quite differs from the original in that the original's mostly major chord progression is turned here into mostly minor, which emphasises a more melancholic feel. It is also arranged in 4/4 (as opposed to the original's waltz time), with a driving piano-bass-drum section. Andrew Weatherall later remixed the song to further emphasise the dub bassline; this remix was featured on both releases of the single and on the compilation Casino Classics (on American and European versions of the single, a Flowered Up remix is erroneously featured instead of the Andrew Weatherall mix). The follow-up single \\"Kiss and Make Up\\" is also a cover version of a (comparatively obscure) song written and originally recorded by The Field Mice. Ian Catt was the engineer/co-producer on both versions. \\"Carnt Sleep\\" is based on the Youthman riddim, a backing track that reggae producer Glen Brown has used on dozens of records since the late 1970s. \\"Wilson\\" is based on a loop of the intro to Wilson Pickett's version of \\"Hey Jude\\" and spoken samples from a decimalisation training record. \\"Nothing Can Stop Us\\", one of the group's most famous singles, features a very prominent sample of Dusty Springfield's track, \\"I Can't Wait Until I See My Baby's Face\\" (from her 1967 album Where Am I Going?.) Saint Etienne later recorded a version of \\"Nothing Can Stop Us\\" with vocals by Kylie Minogue. The dialogue heard in the track \\"Etienne Gonna Die\\" is from the movie House of Games. Saint Etienne members have named OMD's Dazzle Ships as a prominent influence on the album. Artwork The young woman on the cover of Foxbase Alpha, Celina Nash, was a member of the group Golden alongside Lucy Gillie and Candida Richardson; they released two singles (Anglo American/ Don't Destroy Me in 1992, and Wishful Thinking, written by Jarvis Cocker, in 1993) on Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs's Icerink Records label.http://www.saintetiennedisco.com/connected/golden/golden.htmlhttps://www.discogs.com/artist/561477-Celina- Nashhttps://intothepopvoid.com/2015/04/20/golden-anglo-american Nash also appears in Saint Etienne's 1993 album So Tough; she is the waitress who can be heard on \\"Chicken Soup\\". She is also in the video for the Pulp song \\"Babies\\".http://www.saintetiennedisco.com/connected/golden/golden.html Releases =US edition= The US version of the album, released in January 1992, adds two bonus tracks: a new version of \\"Kiss and Make Up\\", rerecorded with Cracknell, and a unique version of \\"People Get Real\\", which was released as a double 'A' side single with \\"Join Our Club\\" later the same year. =2009 Deluxe Edition= The album was re-released in May 2009 as part of the Universal Music Deluxe Edition re-issue program. The album has been remastered, and is accompanied by a second disc featuring B-sides, mixes and five previously unreleased tracks.

In addition to the two CDs this package also included a 6\\" Subbuteo figure and a replica Foxbase Alpha poster, as well as a set of four badges. =Foxbase Beta= In 2009, Foxbase Alpha was 're-produced' and remixed from the original multi-tracks by Richard X. This new version was called Foxbase Beta, and formed the basis of much of what was played during the band's May 2009 tour, which saw Foxbase Alpha played live in its entirety for the first time. Foxbase Beta was packaged with an additional CD titled Foxbase Extra, featuring a commentary on the album by Bob Stanley, Pete Wiggs and Richard X, and additional out-takes. A single disc version was sold at their 2009 shows and through Rough Trade Records in London. =25th Anniversary Edition= Available for pre-order in 2016, the 25th Anniversary Edition shipped in 2017. The set included the original album pressed on two 12\\" vinyl records, a second 12\\" vinyl record entitled Remains of the Day with additional tracks not previously available on vinyl, and a 7\\" single of Kiss and Make Up, featuring vocals by Moira Lambert.

Early life and studies Murail was born in Le Havre, France. His father, Gérard Murail, is a poet and his mother, Marie-Thérèse Barrois, a journalist. One of his brothers, Lorris Murail, and his younger sister Elvire Murail, a.k.a. Moka, are also writers, and his younger sister Marie-Aude Murail is a French children's writer. Following his university studies in Arabic and economics, Murail attended the Paris Conservatory, where he studied composition with Olivier Messiaen Kennedy, Michael (2006), The Oxford Dictionary of Music, from 1967 to 1972. He taught computer music and composition at IRCAM in Paris from 1991 to 1997. While there, he assisted in the development of Patchwork composition software. In 1973 he was a founding member of the Ensemble l'Itinéraire. From 1997 until 2010, he was a professor of composition at Columbia University in New York City.http://www.tristanmurail.com/en/biographie.html Music Murail is associated with the \\"spectral\\" technique of composition, which involves the use of the fundamental properties of sound as a basis for harmony, as well as the use of spectral analysis, FM, RM, and AM synthesis as a method of deriving polyphony.http://www.compositiontoday.com/articles/tristan_murail.asp Major pieces by Murail include large orchestral pieces such as Gondwana, Time and Again and, more recently, Serendib and L'Esprit des dunes. Other pieces include his Désintégrations for 17 instruments and tape, Mémoire/Erosion for French horn and nine instruments Ethers for flute and ensemble, Winter Fragments for flute, clarinet, piano, violin, cello and electronics as well as Vampyr! for electric guitar. Murail also composed a set of solo pieces for various instruments in his cycle Random Access Memory, of which the sixth, Vampyr!, is a rare classical piece for electric guitar.

The conference is noted for producing the Manila Manifesto, a renewed and expanded commitment to the Lausanne Covenant, an influential document in modern Evangelical Christianity. It was also here that the Christian mission strategist Luis Bush first highlighted the need for a major focus of evangelism in the \\"Resistant Belt\\", covering the middle of the eastern hemisphere. Further research in mid-1990 led to the 10/40 Window concept, which contrasts the major needs and few resources devoted to this part of the world. The congress was a very influential world conference of over 4,000 Evangelical Christian leaders that was held in Manila, the Philippines, in 1989 to discuss the progress, resources, and methods of evangelizing the world. The First International Congress on World Evangelization was held in 1974. Notably, it produced the Lausanne Covenant.

Military Career Munro was born as eldest son of William Munro in Druid Stoke, Gloucestershire (now in Bristol), in 1818. In 1834 he entered the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot as an ensign. He was promoted and given the rank of lieutenant in April 1836, captain in July 1844, major in May 1852 and lieutenant colonel in November 1853. He served many years with his regiment in India. However, it was during the Battle of Maharajpore where he was severely wounded on 24 December 1843. In 1876 he was given the colonelcy of the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot for life and on 25 June 1878 promoted to the rank of general. Plant Collecting and Agrostology Munro became a fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1840. He conducted collecting expeditions to India (1834–1838), Kashmir (1847), and Barbados (1870–1875). His main research field was tropical grasses, including the bamboo species of which he published a monograph in 1868. The genera Munroa, Munronia and Munrochloa are named in his honour. Death Munro died in Taunton, Somerset, on 29 January 1880. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Munro when citing a botanical name.

Examples of such techniques are actions that disturb the normal activities of society such as demonstrations, general strike action, riot, terrorism, civil disobedience, and even revolution or insurrection. Social movements often engage in contentious politics. The concept distinguishes these forms of contention from the everyday acts of resistance explored by James C. Scott, interstate warfare, and forms of contention employed entirely within institutional settings, such as elections or sports. Historical sociologist Charles Tilly defines contentious politics as \\"interactions in which actors make claims bearing on someone else's interest, in which governments appear either as targets, initiators of claims, or third parties.\\"Tilly, Charles. Contentious Performances. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008: 5. Contentious politics has existed forever, but its form varies over time and space. For example, Tilly argues that the nature of contentious politics changed fairly dramatically with the birth of social movements in 18th-century Europe. The concept of contentious politics was developed throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century by its most prominent scholars in the United States: Sidney Tarrow, Charles Tilly, and Doug McAdam. Until its development, the study of contentious politics was divided among a number of traditions each of which were concerned with the description and explanation of different contentious political phenomena, especially the social movement, the strike, and revolution. One of the primary goals of these three authors was to advance the explanation of these phenomena and other contentious politics under a single research agenda.McAdam, Doug, Sidney Tarrow, and Charles Tilly. Dynamics of Contention. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. There remains a significant plurality of agendas in addition to the one these three propose. Contentious and disruptive political tactics may overlap with movements for social justice. For example, the political theorist Clarissa Rile Hayward has argued that theories, in particular that of Iris Marion Young, that situate the responsibility to correct large-scale injustices like institutional racism with the groups that benefit from oppressive institutions overlook the fact that people will rarely challenge institutions that benefit them. She argues that in certain cases contentious politics are the only practical resolution.

MacLaine plays a fictional former First Lady protected by an entourage of Secret Service agents led by one she continually exasperates (Cage). The film is set in Somersville, Ohio (played by Parkton, Maryland\\"Parkton Community Profile\\" , ePodunk) and was nominated for a Golden Globe award in 1995 (Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Comedy/Musical: Shirley MacLaine). Plot Doug Chesnic is a Secret Service agent who takes great pride in his job, performing his duties with the utmost professionalism. His assignment for the last three years has been a severe test of his patience. Doug is in charge of a team stationed in Ohio to protect Tess Carlisle, the widow of a former U.S. President. Tess is well known for her diplomatic and philanthropic work, but seems to regard Doug less as a security officer and more as a domestic servant—not unlike her chauffeur, Earl, or her nurse, Frederick. Doug's assignment with Tess comes to an end, so he is eager to be given a more exciting and challenging assignment. Tess decides that she wants him to stay, and Doug's assignment is extended. Doug regards it as beneath his professional dignity to perform little chores around the house or bring Tess her breakfast in bed. Tess orders him to do so, even to fetch her ball during a round of golf. When Doug defies her, Tess contacts a close friend - the current President of the United States – to express her displeasure. The annoyed President - under the impression Doug is substandard - chastises him by phone. The bickering between Doug and Tess continues, even in the car. While alone with Earl, Tess orders him to drive off, stranding her bodyguards. A humiliated Doug must phone the local sheriff—not for the first time—to be on the lookout for her. He fires Earl when they return, but Tess countermands that decision. After returning from a hospital checkup, Tess watches old television footage of her husband's funeral, concentrating on a momentary glimpse of Doug among the mourners, overcome with grief. She makes an effort to get on his good side, sharing a drink and a late-night conversation. She explains that she is not close to her children, in part due to the awkward upbringing they had as political family. Morale for the agents improves when Tess tells them that the President will be visiting her late husband's presidential library, but his subsequent cancellation lowers her spirits. During a day out, Tess and Earl take off again without Doug on another apparent joy ride. When they don't return that night, Doug and his security detail realize Tess was likely kidnapped and contact the FBI. The FBI's investigation reveals Tess' recent dizzy spells were caused by an inoperable brain tumor (which she had indirectly told Doug about) and eventually, the car is found with an unconscious Earl but no Tess. Earl is found with small crescent-shaped burns on the back of his neck which Doug soon suspects was caused by Tess, fighting back with the car's cigarette lighter. In Earl's hospital room, Doug and FBI agent Schaeffer question the chauffeur. Earl gets nervous and defensive when he sees Doug holding the lighter and the furious Secret Service agent threatens to shoot off the chauffeur's toes, one by one, until he confesses to them where Tess is being held. Doug goes so far as to shoot one toe.Guarding Tess Script Scriporama Earl admits that Tess is being held captive by his sister and her husband. The FBI and Secret Service raid the kidnappers' home and arrest them. When they find Tess buried, but alive, beneath the floor of the farmhouse, Doug and his agents volunteer to do the digging. Tess then insists that her Secret Service detail accompany her to the hospital. Upon being released from the hospital, Tess refuses to obey the hospital rule that patients must be discharged in a wheelchair. Doug tells her, using her first name for the first time, \\"Tess, get in the God damn chair.\\" After a brief pause, Tess complies, pats Doug's hand and says, \\"Very good, Douglas.\\" Cast * Shirley MacLaine as Tess Carlisle * Nicolas Cage as Doug Chesnic * Austin Pendleton as Earl Fowler * Edward Albert as Barry Carlisle * James Rebhorn as Howard Schaeffer * Richard Griffiths as Frederick * John Roselius as Tom Bahlor * David Graf as Lee Danielson * Don Yesso as Ralph Buoncristiani * James Lally as Joe Spector * Brant von Hoffman as Bob Hutcherson * Harry J.

Zhang Ren Tomb Zhang Ren's grave is located in Weigan Village (桅杆村), Beiwai District (北外鄉), Guanghan, Sichuan. During the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor in the Qing dynasty, the local government erected a tombstone for the grave with the words \\"Tomb of the Han General Zhang Ren\\" (漢將軍張公任之墓) inscribed on it. In 1954, a brick bearing the words \\"Built in the 8th month of the 6th year of Yuankang\\" was unearthed at the site of the tomb. The brick serves as evidence that the tomb was constructed in as early as 296 during the Yuankang era (291–300) of the reign of Emperor Hui in the Western Jin dynasty. In July 1990, the tomb became a Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the County Level under the Guanghan administration. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Zhang Ren appears in chapters 60–64 of the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. Like his historical counterpart, Zhang Ren serves under Liu Zhang and is known for being very loyal to his lord. When Liu Bei first enters Yi Province in the name of helping Liu Zhang counter a rival warlord, Zhang Lu, Zhang Ren and others warn Liu Zhang to be wary of Liu Bei and take precautionary measures, but Liu Zhang ignores them. When Liu Zhang attends a banquet hosted by Liu Bei, Liu Bei's strategist Pang Tong instructs the general Wei Yan to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to assassinate Liu Zhang. Zhang Ren senses danger so he draws his sword and pretends to join the sword dance while secretly protecting Liu Zhang from Wei Yan's advances. When war breaks out between Liu Bei and Liu Zhang, Zhang Ren sets up an ambush at the Valley of the Fallen Phoenix, where his archers kill Pang Tong. After Zhang Ren is captured alive, Liu Bei asks him to surrender but he firmly refuses and is executed. Liu Bei feels it was a pity so he has Zhang Ren buried with full honours.
