Similar to the microgames produced by Steve Jackson Games, it was sold in a transparent plastic shell case and came with rulebook, full-color hex-map, counters, and one six-sided die. Other games in this series (called \\"minigames\\" by TSR) include They've Invaded Pleasantville!, Remember the Alamo, Attack Force, Vampyre, Viking Gods, Icebergs and Saga. The action of the game takes place on Imhirrhos, the ninth planet in the Antares system. Two to four players assume the roles of leaders of different factions fighting for control of the planet as the influence of Earth's Imperial Terran Empire begins to weaken. The factions include seven different ruling families or houses, Terran Empire forces, natives, and alien Silakkans. Players can choose from one of three different game scenarios. House Leaders Each of the seven houses has a leader with varying numbers of forces to command such as Hovercrafts, Jump Troops, Laser Tanks, and Power Infantry as well as one Artifact (see below). Each leader also possesses a special ability. *House Braganza, led by Catherine \\"the Mad\\" Braganza who can summon lightning *House Edistyn, led by Nureb Khan Edistyn who has the power of precognition *House Fitzgerald, led by Simon Fitzgerald who can create morale-boosting ion waves *House Kinrabe, led by Barracuda Kinrabe, an illusionist *House Mackenzie, led by Black Dougal Mackenzie who can teleport *House Orsini, led by Messalina Orsini who has the power of fascination *House Sessedi, led by Ariton Sessedi, a telepath Galactic Heroes If a house leader is killed during combat, the player has the opportunity to recruit a Galactic Hero to replace him. Like house leaders, Galactic Heroes also have special powers or lead additional forces. *Andros, an alien android who can summon a \\"Phantom Regiment\\" *Corvus Andromeda, an intergalactic assassin *Doctor Death, a criminal who has the power to create an army of zombies *Emerald Eridani, the commander of the Emerald Company laser tank battalion *The Iron General, the cyborg leader of a group of mercenary laser tanks *Lyra Starfire, a scantily clad adventuress and commander of an airjet squadron *The Nullspace Kid, a young adventurer and airjet squadron pilot *Skarn 3, an alien mercenary who commands a band of jump troops *Subadai O'Reilly, the commander of \\"O'Reilly's Raiders,\\" a power infantry battalion *Tovan Palequire, an intergalactic smuggler and arms dealer Other Factions In addition to the seven house leaders there are three other power groups that may or may not come into play depending on the game scenario. *Ward Serpentine, leader of the Terrans *Mirrhos, leader of the natives *Magron, leader of the alien Silakkans Artifacts Each house has possession of a special alien artifact, chosen at random at the beginning of the game. *Devastator *Dimensional Plane *Energy Drainer *Field Generator *Force Cannon *Sonic Imploder *UFO Scenarios and Gameplay Revolt on Antares has three different game scenarios: Revolt Against Terra (the basic game), The Silakka Invasion, and Power Politics on Imirrhos. *In Revolt Against Terra, the game is played over the course of ten turns. Each turn consists of ten ordered phases where players take actions such as movement, combat, recruitment, and forging alliances. The player with the greatest number of victory points at the end of ten turns wins the game. Victory points are earned for owning or capturing different economic zones and for owned or captured house fortresses. *The Silakka Invasion *Power Politics on Imirrhos Reception William A. Barton reviewed Revolt On Antares in The Space Gamer No. 44. Barton commented that \\"Although Revolt On Antares isn't overly exciting, it can be an interesting little game to play, especially if you like the smaller games with an SF (make that science fantasy) flavor.\\" References External links * Category:Board games introduced in 1981 Category:Board wargames Category:TSR, Inc. games ","title":"Revolt On Antares"},{"id":"9902194","text":"Arcticoceras is an extinct ammonoid cephalopod genus from the late Middle Jurassic belonging to the ammonite family Cardioceratidae, more commonly found to high northern latitudes.

It is based on principles explained in 1989 by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM). The NCTM document, Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, attempted to set forth a vision for K-12 (ages 5-18) mathematics education in the United States and Canada. Their recommendations were adopted by many education agencies, from local to federal levels through the 1990s. In 2000, NCTM revised its standards with the publication of Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (PSSM). Like the first publication, these updated standards have continued to serve as the basis for many states' mathematics standards, and for many federally funded textbook projects. The first standards gave a strong call for a de-emphasis on manual arithmetic in favor of students' discovering their own knowledge and conceptual thinking. The PSSM has taken a more balanced view, but still emphasizes conceptual thinking and problem solving. Mathematics instruction in this style has been called standards-based mathematics\\"Standards-Based Mathematics Curriculum Materials: A Phrase in Search of a Definition\\" By Paul R. Trafton, Barbara J. Reys, and Deanna G. Wasman or reform mathematics.Reform Mathematics vs. the Basics Principles and standards The momentum for reform in mathematics education began in the early 1980s, as educators reacted to the \\"new math\\" of the 1960s and 1970s. The work of Piaget and other developmental psychologists was shifting the focus of mathematics educators from mathematics content to how children best learn mathematics. John A. Van de Walle, Elementary and Middle School Mathematics: Teaching Developmentally Longman, 2001, The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics summarized the state of current research with the publication of Curriculum and Evaluation Standards in 1989 and Principles and Standards for School Mathematics in 2000, bringing definition to the reform movement in North America.See Van Hiele model for an example of research that influenced the NCTM Standards. Reform mathematics curricula challenge students to make sense of new mathematical ideas through explorations and projects, often in real contexts. Reform texts emphasize written and verbal communication, working in cooperative groups, making connections between concepts, and connections between representations. By contrast, \\"traditional\\" textbooks emphasize procedural mathematics and provide step-by-step examples with skill exercises. Traditional mathematics focuses on teaching algorithms that will lead to the correct answer. Because of this focus on application of algorithms, the traditional math student must always use the specific method that is being taught. This kind of algorithmic dependence is de-emphasized in reform mathematics.The NCTM Calls it \\"Math\\" Reformers do not oppose correct answers, but prefer to focus students' attention on the process leading to the answer, rather than the answer itself. The presence of occasional errors is deemed less important than the overall thought process. Research has shown that children make fewer mistakes with calculations and remember algorithms longer when they understand the concepts underlying the methods they use. In general, children in reform classes perform at least as well as children in traditional classes on tests of calculation skill, and considerably better on tests of problem solving. Controversy \\"Principles and Standards for School Mathematics\\" was championed by educators, administrators and some mathematiciansThe position of the MAA is \\"We believe that PSSM outlines an ambitious, challenging and idealized program whose implementation would be a vast improvement over the current state of mathematics education.\\"The MAA and the New NCTM Standards as raising standards for all students, but it was criticized by some for valuing understanding processes more than learning standard procedures. Parents, educators and some mathematicians opposing reform mathematics complained about students becoming confused and frustrated, claiming that it was an inefficient style of instruction characterized by frequent false starts. Proponents of reform mathematics countered that research showed that, when done correctly, students in reform math curricula learned basic math skills at least as well as those in traditional programs, and additionally understood the underlying concepts much better. Communities that adopted reform curricula generally saw increased math scores by their students. However, one study has found that first-grade students with a below-average aptitude in math responded best to teacher-directed instruction. During the 1990s, the development and large- scale adoption of curricula such as Mathland was criticized for partially or entirely abandoning teaching of standard arithmetic methods such as regrouping or common denominators. Protests from groups such as Mathematically Correct led to many districts and states abandoning such textbooks. Some states such as California revised their mathematics standards to partially or largely repudiate the basic beliefs of reform mathematics, and re-emphasize mastery of standard mathematics facts and methods. The American Institutes for Research (AIR) reported in 2005 that the NCTM proposals \\"risk exposing students to unrealistically advanced mathematics content in the early grades.\\" This is in reference to NCTM's recommendation that algebraic concepts, such as understanding patterns and properties like commutativity (2+3=3+2), should be taught as early as first grade. Some, such as the 2008 National Mathematics Advisory Panel, called for a balance between reform and traditional mathematics teaching styles rather than a \\"war\\" between the two styles.February 17, 2008 10:44 p.m. State's proposed new math standards don't add up, critics say By JESSICA BLANCHARD \\"the district's elementary and middle-school math textbook choices lack a good balance between reform and traditional learning styles\\" In 2006 NCTM published its Curriculum Focal Points, which made clear that standard algorithms were to be included in all elementary school curricula, as well as activities aiming at conceptual understanding. A common misconception was that reform educators did not want children to learn the standard methods of arithmetic. As the NCTM Focal Points made clear, such methods were still the ultimate goal, but reformers believed that conceptual understanding should come first. Reform educators believed that such understanding is best pursued by allowing children at first to solve problems using their own understanding and methods. Under guidance from the teacher, students eventually arrive at an understanding of standard methods. Even the controversial NCTM Standards of 1989 did not call for abandoning standard algorithms, but instead recommended a decreased emphasis on complex paper-and-pencil computation drills and greater attention to mental computation, estimation skills, thinking strategies for mastering basic facts and conceptual understanding of arithmetic operations. During the peak of the controversy in the 1990s, unfavorable terminology for reform mathematics appeared in press and web articles, including Where's the math?,San Francisco Chronicle: Where's the Math? anti-math,The State's Invisible Math Standards: \\"With Zacarias' anti-math policies in force...\\" math for dummies,Math Framework in California NCTM \\"A State Dummies Down\\", editorial, The Business Journal (Sacramento), 10 April 1995 rainforest algebra, Texas adopts textbook rejected by nation: Adoption of \\"Rainforest Algebra\\" appears to contradict this logic math for women and minorities, David Klein: \\"This misguided view of women and minorities...\\" and new new math. New, New Math = Controversy CBS News 5/28/2000 Most of these critical terms refer to the 1989 standards rather than the PSSM. Beginning in 2011, most states adopted the Common Core Standards, which attempted to incorporate reform ideas, rigor (introducing ideas at a younger age) and a leaner math curriculum.

He is played by actor Dave Annable. In a 2010 episode, actor Dylan Larsen portrayed Justin as a young child in flashback sequences set in 1986. Character history =Background= Justin is the youngest child of Nora and William Walker. Born in 1982, he was an unexpected pregnancy and is considerably younger than the rest of the Walker family and often feels over- protected by his parents and siblings as a result. When Justin was in his early teens, a family friend named Tucker Booth introduced him to drugs. After September 11, when Kitty returned from New York to stay with her family, she confides to Justin her experiences and fears stemming from that catastrophic event. It was for these reasons that he was compelled to join the Army. When he returned from Afghanistan, he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder, leading to his drug addiction. Nora blamed Kitty for encouraging Justin to join the army, leading to their estrangement. =The Black Sheep= Justin spent much of his time getting high up north with his buddies and spending little time doing anything else in his youth. The closest thing in his life to a relationship was with a fellow aimless drug addict named Fawn. One day at while visiting his father at Ojai Foods (the family company), Justin saw his father talking to a mysterious woman - Holly Harper - at the company. After his father's death, Justin saw her again making a brief appearance at the funeral. He tracked her down and asked her how she knew his father; Holly told him they'd been lovers for years. To make matters worse, his father's will stipulated that Justin's inheritance would go in a conservatorship due to his worry that he would blow it all on drugs and alcohol, with Kitty as the conservator. Justin was humiliated, didn't show up for his job at a restaurant, and wasn't heard from until the next day when Nora got a call that he'd been picked up by the police. Nora, Kevin, and Kitty got him out of jail, but he bristled at Nora telling him how disappointed William would be in him. Despite his problems, Justin has redeeming characteristics. But he had his own serious issues. He continued taking prescription painkillers, like Oxycodone and Vicodin, for his posttraumatic stress disorder, nearly costing him another job (as a bell boy). His boss was a young woman named Tyler, whom he knew casually in high school. They began dating. Also, when Justin's brother Tommy found out he was sterile and asked Kevin to be a sperm donor, for his wife Julia, Kevin initially refused, so Justin said he'd be a donor. Tommy said he didn't want Justin to be a donor, since he wasn't reliable and used drugs. Justin was hurt but eventually Tommy changed his mind. Both Kevin and Justin were donors, and agreed they would never find out who the father was. =Iraq & Drug Use= At this point, things were looking up for Justin. Unfortunately, he got orders to go to Iraq. He was so devastated by the news that he relapsed, badly, and overdosed. He also ruined his relationship with Tyler, as she had seen him with Fawn on a drug high and told him she didn't want to deal with his behavior (she didn't know about his learning he had to go to Iraq). With Kevin's help, Justin was given a reprieve for six months, as long as he went to rehab. His former boss and girlfriend, Tyler, returned after Justin cleaned up his drug habit. He ran into her when she was with her new boyfriend for a Valentine's Day dinner. He apologized to her for his past behavior, and she decided to give their relationship another go. They were happy together briefly, but soon he decided that until he dealt with all his problems, he shouldn't put another person through what he was dealing with. Eventually, the time came for Justin to return to active duty. Justin wanted to ship out to Iraq without letting his family know, so he slipped away from his sister, Kitty's, engagement party informing only Rebecca. Rebecca told Kitty and Nora and they rushed to the airport for a tearful goodbye. Several months later, Justin returned from Iraq with a leg injury. He suffered from tremendous pain, but refused to take meds because of his history as an addict. Eventually, after strong pressure, Nora convinced him to start taking pain medication, to which he became addicted once more. =Rebecca= Justin found out that he had a half-sister, Rebecca Harper, the product of William and Holly. Most of the Walkers were hesitant about how to deal with this new relation, but Justin went to visit her as soon as he learned of her existence. She helped him steer clear of drugs and he ardently defended her when she said Sarah's husband made a pass at her. Justin later had an inkling that Rebecca may not, in fact, be his sister. She took a paternity test and told him that she was his sister, to his relief. This relief was short-lived however, as he began to develop what could only be called \\"inappropriate\\" feelings for her - of a romantic nature. He told his brother Kevin about it and Kevin told him to stay away from her, which he did. But eventually, he told her his feelings and she \\"freaked out\\". The day after, he apologized to her. She then revealed to him that she was not actually his half-sister, but the daughter of David Caplan. He became very angry at her about this and immediately told his mother, and as a result, the rest of the Walker family. In the season 2 season finale, they made amends and he asked if they could start over. Later, they met at a hill and she told him she believed all the craziness was supposed to lead her to him and they shared their first kiss. In season 4 Justin misses their wedding rehearsal over the stress of med school and becoming a father. He witnesses a small boy being hit by a car and comes to the boy's aid. He then realizes how much he wants to be a husband and a father, and he later tells an upset Rebecca what happened and professes his love to her. She says the wedding is back on however it is interrupted when Kitty collapses, Kitty is fine after getting a bone marrow transplant from Ryan but Rebecca miscarries the baby, putting a toll on their relationship. Later Rebecca and Justin elope and spend their honeymoon at the Ojai Ranch. =Medical School= Justin, after Robert's heart situation, told Rebecca that he wanted to become a doctor in the first place. In the next episodes we see him applying for a series of universities, and he even got a recommendation letter from Robert. Later we see that he was accepted. In Pregnant Pause he gets his midfinals mailed to him and discovers he's on academic probation. Rebecca later helps Justin realize that the reason he has so much trouble in school may be caused by Dyslexia. =Homecoming= In the start of season 5, Justin returns from the army to find that Rebecca has moved out and reveals to the Walkers that they divorced because Justin went back to the army blaming himself for not saving Robert, leaving Rebecca to deal with the problems of her mother on her own. They later come to an understanding. Justin and Rebecca love each other but she goes to New York after being offered a photography job. Justin also begins dating a nurse, Annie and starts working as a paramedic. However, after performing a procedure to inflate a man's lung to keep him from dying Justin discovers that it could lead him to a suspension. But Annie's ex-boyfriend Dr. Rick bails him out and Justin gets in a fight with him during a staff baseball game and breaks up with Annie, telling her that he doesn't think she's over Dr. Rick. Later Justin meets Zach, an ex-marine, living on the streets and takes it upon himself to help him sort out his life by letting him stay in his house and getting him a job in Scotty's restaurant. It soon becomes clear after spending his time trying to help everyone else that Justin needs to focus on sorting out his own life and Zach moves out thanking Justin for what he has done. When he and Luc check bookings at a hotel for Luc's cousins visiting for his bachelor party Justin bumps into his old love Tyler. Justin asks if she would like to meet up and although he is hesitant at first Tyler explains that she is married but separated. Justin opens up about his own divorce and the two share a kiss.

Originating in the United States in the 1990s, it has spread to be practiced by amateur and professional dancers around the world, and it is growing with the spread of tribal belly dance formats. History Originating in the Middle East, South Asia (India), and North Africa, the art of belly dance arrived in the West with the trend of Orientalism. Exotic to the Western eye and mysterious in its roots, belly dance has always attracted interpretive dance artists who have woven it into trends of Western culture. As a modern and versatile world dance genre, belly dance has evolved into an array of interpretive dance sub-styles compatible with modern music and imagery. The new millennium brought a revival of popular interest in Goth subculture and Gothic art motifs in dance, and a new interpretive style, Gothic belly dance, was propelled to prominence. Dance publications started exploring this new phenomenon,Dancing Darkly: Laura Tempest Schmidt, \\"The Phenomenon of Gothic Belly Dance\\" thousands of Gothic belly dance enthusiasts have subscribed to online discussion groups dedicated to this genre, leading artists started traveling across the US and overseas with workshops and tours, DVDsGothic Bellydance (2006) featuring Gothic belly dance performances,\\"Shades of Goth Fall Upon Belly Dance; Gothic Bellydance: The Darker Side of Fusion produced by WorldDance New York\\" DVD review by Amulya and instructional materials have appeared on retail shelves. The cover of Gothic Bellydance DVD, 2006, World Dance New York, featuring Tempest and Ariellah Aflalo The cover of Gothic Bellydance - Revelations DVD, 2007, World Dance New York, featuring Blanca and Jeniviva Gothic belly dance was born in the US urban centers as a blend of Goth and world music, the movement vocabulary of belly dance and other dance forms, and Gothic fashion and aesthetics. Performing at Gothic-themed events and Goth clubs, dancers started to explore Goth music and adopt costuming styles incorporating Victorian, vampire, dark cabaret, silent-movie vamp, industrial, and other visual themes related to Goth subculture. Gothic belly dance is not just a US phenomenon. Its popularity has been growing in the UK and Germany where belly dance artists have been dancing darkly since the early 1990s. Early Goth dancers did not have a label for what they did, but thanks to the Gothla dance festivals, Gothic belly dance came to be recognised in Europe. Dancers performing Gothic belly dance usually retain their preferred technique -- mostly modern cabaret and tribal fusion belly dance -- but also bring new emphasis to the dramatic and theatrical features of their dance to match the intensity and vibe of Goth music. The 21st century Gothic belly dance discussion groups hosted by tribe.net, MySpace, and other online community sites connected dancers from around the world, making possible workshops and tours, and helping this new genre to solidify and gain recognition within the larger dance community. In addition, the rapidly expanding global access to free online video resources at YouTube and similar sites has allowed artists to unify and combine their efforts in promoting and developing their genre -- unconstrained by national borders, scarcity of funds, or lack of support from their local communities. In 2007 Southern California-based dancers and instructors, Tempest and Sashi, launched the annual Gothla, described by the L.A. Weekly as \\"a \\"Gothic hafla\\" that combined weekend-long workshops with a Saturday festival featuring 12 hours of performances and merchant booths where dancers could find costumes and accessories.\\" Gothla UK was also first held in 2007, in Leicester, England, and is now a highly successful festival covering three days, usually in July. International teachers are joined by UK teachers such as Lucretia (Christine Emery), Fulya (Lynn Chapman), and Akasha (Heike Humphreys) to offer a range of themes not often covered by general belly dance events from Steampunk and 1920s to zombie and vampire belly dance.

Members of the Scottish Junior Football Association, they currently play in the East Region Super League. History Formed in 1920 as Broughty Ex-Servicemen, the club was retitled Broughty Athletic in 1951. Around the same time they moved to Claypotts Park, directly opposite the medieval Claypotts Castle. In 1989 the ground was renamed Whitton Park, in memory of player and club official Eddie Whitton, who had died on 5 June 1989. The SJFA restructured its leagues prior to the 2006‚Äì07 season, and \\"The Fed\\", as the club is known, found themselves in the twelve-team East Region, North Division. In seasons 2007‚Äì08 and 2008‚Äì09, Broughty Athletic narrowly missed out on promotion, finishing second top of the Scottish Junior Football Association's North Division in both seasons. In 2009‚Äì10 promotion to the twelve-team Premier League was finally achieved. The club maintained Premier Division status by finishing eighth at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season. They extended their stay in the Premier League when they finished in ninth place at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. The Fed finished bottom in the 2012‚Äì13 season, but stayed up due to a league reconstruction. They finished seventh in 2013‚Äì14 season and were promoted in season 2014‚Äì15 to the Super League following a two-legged play-off win over Armadale Thistle. In their first season in the Super League the Fed finished a respectable tenth in the sixteen team league. In season 2016‚Äì17 they went on to finish as high as seventh in the league and also triumphed in the GA Engineering Cup, beating rivals Tayport 5-1 in the final. The team have been managed since February 2018 by former Dundee United and Scotland U21 midfielder Jamie McCunnie, who assumed the role after a short interim period. Dundee East Community Sport Club Project Dundee East Community Sports Club is currently the most developed model of a Community Sports Club which Broughty Athletic are part of. The Hub is made up of 5 local football clubs, a Rugby Club, Cricket Club, Tennis and Table Tennis Club, Bowling Club, a local Handball Club and also a Karate Club providing a pathway from ages 5 up to Adult's including Amateur and Junior level football clubs, The Hub itself is based in the East side of Dundee and is situated around Whitton Park, Forthill Sports Club, Douglas Sports Centre, Claypotts and Dawson grass pitches. DECSC are also developing strong links with the local primary and secondary schools. The Hub currently has 12 clubs involved within its structure and has over 1200 members and 150 qualified coaches and volunteers. The Community Club already has a development plan in place and is working hard to implement the plan within the five-year set timescale. Their development plans are centred on the current development of Whitton Park facility to include a 7-a-side 3G floodlit training pitch and also an 11-a-side floodlit playing pitch which will be fully utilised by the local community. The 7-a-side pitch has been built and has been in use since July 2012. There will also be significant developments in changing facilities with a new state of the art stand to be built on the West side of the Whitton park which will include 6 changing rooms, fitness suite and also meeting and socialising facilities. The Dundee East Community Sports Club has benefited from having a very strong committee in place. They have been successful in attracting committee members from all of the resulting clubs within the community club structure. They are a very ambitious committee and they are all working hard to ensure all the proposed developments come to life. The Club has already established a branding and marketing profile which all teams affiliated are displaying on their team colours and the club have also already delivered fun day events and football festivals on a citywide basis. They hope that the new Whitton Park facilities will be built and be running before 2016 Colours and crest Broughty Athletic's traditional colours are red and white. In addition to Claypotts Castle, Broughty Ferry also has its own castle, which appears on the club badge shown.

The campaign resulted in the communist victory. Prelude In mid October 1947, the nationalists had gathered forces included the V Corps centered at Luoyang at the east, and the Reorganized 1st Division and the Reorganized 36th Division at Tongguan County at the west for the preparation to reopen the Longhai railway transportation / communication line by first surrounding and then annihilating the communist force led by commander Chen Geng (ÈôàËµì) and political commissar Xie Fuzhi. On October 20, 1947, the communist high command ordered Chen Geng (ÈôàËµì) and Xie Fuzhi to split their force into three: one part would remain along the railroad to distract the enemy, and the other would strike southern Shaanxi. The third part, the main force, should cross the railroad to push southward, and would strike regions included Nanzhao (ÂçóÂè¨), Wuyang (ËàûÈò≥), and Fangcheng (ÊñπÂüé) in western Hubei to establish new bases. To carry out this strategy, Chen Geng (ÈôàËµì) and Xie Fuzhi decided to launch the Campaign in the Eastern Foothills of the Funiu Mountains. Order of battle Both sides were equally matched in terms of numbers, but the nationalists enjoyed significant technical advantage in terms of weaponry. *Nationalist order of battle: 9 divisions total **The Reorganized 1st Division **The Reorganized 3rd Division **The Reorganized 10th Division **The Reorganized 15th Division **The 20th Division **The Reorganized 36th Division **The Reorganized 41st Division **The 206th Division **Local security brigades and regiments *Communist order of battle: 9 divisions total **The 4th Column **The 9th Column **The 38th Army First stage The campaign started on October 29, 1947 with the communist 55th Division of the 38th Army deployed along the Longhai Railroad to tie down the nationalist forces, and the rest units of the communist 38th Army and the 12th Brigade of the communist 4th Column struck toward southern Shaanxi. The rest units of the communist 4th Column and the communist 9th Column struck the nationalist controlled regions in multiple fronts. From November 1, 1947 to November 4, 1947, Linru (‰∏¥Ê±ù), Jia (ÈÉè) County, Dengfeng (ÁôªÂ∞Å), Lushan (È≤ÅÂ±±), and Baofeng (ÂÆù‰∏∞) fell into the communist hands. The nationalist Reorganized 15th Division guarding these regions suffered greatly in the process, with more than 2,500 killed in the battle of Jia (ÈÉè) County alone on November 4, 1947. The nationalists were forced to redeploy by dispatching the Reorganized 3rd Division and the 20th Division toward Baofeng (ÂÆù‰∏∞) and Jia (ÈÉè) County, the 124th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 41st Division toward Linru (‰∏¥Ê±ù), and the 125th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 41st Division toward Xiang City (Xiang Cheng, Ë•ÑÂüé) in hope of luring the communists out to fight a decisive battle. However, the enemy would not take the bait and instead, took advantage of the nationalist redeployment by striking regions where nationalist defense was weakened by the redeployment. On November 3, 1947, the communist 27th Brigade of the 9th Column besieged the town of Nanzhao (ÂçóÂè¨), and launched the assault on the town at 1:00 AM on November 4, 1947. The strongest fortification at the Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, ‰∏úÂÖ≥) was blown up and attacking enemy subsequently penetrated into the town and annihilated most of the nationalist garrison consisted of two battalions. As the survivors attempted to flee via the western gate, they were ambushed by the waiting enemy and the entire 500 strong nationalist garrison was thus completely wiped out. After taking the town, the communists opened up the nationalist food depot and treasury to distribute food and money to the local populace, most of which was in severe poverty, and thus completely won over the local popular support. On November 5, 1947, the 75th Regiment of the 25th Brigade of the communist 9th Column reached the outskirt of the Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé). Although the nationalists had built many fortifications both inside and outside the town, the local nationalist commander Wang Jingxiu (ÁéãÊï¨‰øÆ) was well aware that his four-regiments strong security brigade was not a match for the enemy, and in order to avoid annihilation, the nationalist garrison wisely abandoned the town without a fight, thus successfully retreated before the enemy besieged the town. After entering the town, the communist force with strict discipline discredited the negative nationalist propaganda about the communists and consequently, the local popular support drastically switched to the communist side. The initial communist success was totally unexpected by the nationalists, who was completely shocked by the rapid territorial expansion of the enemy. Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered the commander-in- chief of the 5th Corps Li Tiejun (ÊùéÈìÅÂÜõ) to personally lead the nationalist Reorganized 3rd Division and the 20th Division totaling seven brigades to pursuit the communists for the subsequent elimination. The communists held a conference in the town of Nanzhao (ÂçóÂè¨) on November 8, 1947 and decided not to engage the technically superior nationalist adversary. Instead, the nationalists would be lured into the Funiu Mountains and tricked into dispersing themselves into smaller fragments first, and then when the situation allowed, the communists would annihilate these small fragments one by one. While some communist units would fake as the main force to lure the nationalists into the mountains, the actual main force would take advantage of the overstretched nationalist defense by establishing new communist bases in the remote and rural regions. Second stage The communist 13th Brigade of the 4th Column and the 25th Brigade of the 9th Column under the political commissar Huang Zhen (ÈªÑÈïá) and the deputy commander-in-chief Huang Xiyou (ÈªÑÊñ∞Âèã, unrelated to the political commissar Huang Zhen ÈªÑÈïá) of the communist 9th Column had successfully tricked the nationalists in believing that they were the main communist force by faking as a much larger force on their attack toward Zhenping (ÈïáÂπ≥), Internal Township (Nei Xiang, ÂÜÖ‰π°) and Western Gorge Entrance (Xi Xia Kou, Ë•øÂ≥°Âè£) regions. The nationalists were tricked to deploy the 3rd Reorganized Division and the 125th Brigade of the 41st Division to pursuit the fake enemy main force, and after wasting more than half a month at Summer Hotel (Xia Guang, Â§èÈ¶Ü) and (Xi Xia Kou, Ë•øÂ≥°Âè£) regions, the nationalist force not only failed to annihilate the enemy, but was also incapable of stopping the enemy from cutting the communication / transportation line between (Xi Xia Kou, Ë•øÂ≥°Âè£) and Jingzi Pass (Jing Zi Guang, ËçÜÁ¥´ÂÖ≥). The enemy had planned to lure the nationalists into the Funiu Mountains and then annihilate them in ambushes when the opportunity presented itself, but due to the lack of supplies, the nationalists was forced to withdraw and thus escaped unscratched. The enemy did, however, successfully establish two new bases in the regions: the sixth military district by the communist 39th Regiment of the 13th Brigade in the region of Li Qing's Hotel (Li Qing Dian, ÊùéÈùíÂ∫ó) of Nanzhao (ÂçóÂè¨) county, under the command of the deputy commander of the communist 13th Brigade, Li Xifu (ÈªéÈî°Á¶è), and the seventh military district by the communist 33rd Regiment of the 11th Brigade under the command of the political commissar of the 11th Brigade, Hu Rungui (ËÉ°Ëç£Ë¥µ). Meanwhile, the main force of the communist 9th Column and the 22nd Brigade of the communist 4th Column threatened Luoyang by penetrating into the vicinity of the city, forcing the nationalist 206th Division to be redeployed to strengthen the defensive of the city. The 10th Brigade and the 11th Brigade of the communist 4th Column penetrated into regions of Wuyang (ËàûÈò≥), Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé), and Miyang (Ê≥åÈò≥), forcing the nationalist Reorganized 10th Division and the 124th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 41st Division to be redeployed to east of Beijing-Hankou railroad. In order to take the initiative by luring the nationalists to overstretch themselves, the newly taken towns of Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé) and Nanzhao (ÂçóÂè¨) were intentionally abandoned by the communists, and the nationalists subsequently fell for the trick by ordering Song Kezun (ÂÆãÂèØÂ∞ä), the nationalist chief-of-staff of the sixth regional security command of Henan to reenter the Nanzhao (ÂçóÂè¨) as the new mayor of the town and the commander the local garrison. The former nationalist garrison of the Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé), meanwhile, was ordered back to the town under Wang Jingxiu (ÁéãÊï¨‰øÆ), the commander. On November 11, 1947, the communist 10th Brigade of the 4th Column in the eastern foothills of the Funiu Mountains launched a surprise attack on Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé), and the nationalist defenders abandoned the town and fled, and the town fell into the enemy hands for the second time. On November 13, 1947, the fleeing nationalists were caught up by the 31st Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the communist 4th Column at Erlang Temple, and were thus badly mauled by the pursuing enemy. The nationalist commander Wang Jingxiu (ÁéãÊï¨‰øÆ) learned that the nationalist 20th Division was moving toward Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé), so he ordered his surviving troops to move toward the town in an attempt to link up with his nationalist comrades-in-arms. Little did the nationalists know that their enemy was waiting to ambush them. On November 21, 1947, the communist 10th Brigade of the 4th Column suddenly struck the town of Nanzhao (ÂçóÂè¨), and the nationalist garrison consisted on a security regiment and two companies was overwhelmed. After losing three companies, including more than 50 killed and over 270 captured alive by the attacking enemy, the surviving nationalists were forced to abandon the town and flee, and thus town of Nanzhao (ÂçóÂè¨) had fallen into the enemy hands for the second time, and this time for good. On November 22, 1947, as the nationalist commander Wang Jingxiu (ÁéãÊï¨‰øÆ)'s surviving Self Defense of the Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé) reached Eight Mile Intersection (Ba Li Cha, ÂÖ´ÈáåÂ≤î), King Yu's Village (Wang Yu Zhuang, ÁéãÁ¶πÂ∫Ñ), and Eastern Qi Village (Dong Qi Zhuang, ‰∏úÈΩêÂ∫Ñ) regions south of Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé), it was ambushed by the communist 31st Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the 4th Column. Only 100 or so under the command of the commander of the nationalist force Bai Guixuan (ÁôΩÊ°ÇÁÖä) was lucky enough to escape, while all of the rest were annihilated by the waiting enemy. The nationalists suffered 740 fatalities and another 400+ were captured alive by the enemy, including the deputy commander Ma Lianfu (È©¨ÂªâÂ∫ú), who was able to successfully escape later during a forced march. After his escape, Ma Lianfu (È©¨ÂªâÂ∫ú) immediately went to Kaifeng to ask the nationalist provincial chairman Liu Maoen (ÂàòËåÇÊÅ©) for help, but instead, he was executed on the spot for his failure as Liu Maoen (ÂàòËåÇÊÅ©) ordered him to be shot in front of other nationalist commanders. On the other front, the communist 38th Army established a new base in the regions of Merchant County (Shang Xian, ÂïÜÂéø), Luonan (Ê¥õÂçó) and Merchant Southern (Shang Nan, ÂïÜÂçó), while the communist 12th Brigade established another new base in the regions of Mountain Sun (Shan Yang, Â±±Èò≥), Yun Xi (ÈÉßË•ø), Zhen'an (Zhen An, ÈïáÂÆâ), Upper Pass (Shang Guan, ‰∏äÂÖ≥). On November 23, 1947, the nationalist 133rd Brigade of the 20th Division under the Divisional commander Yang Gancai (Êù®Âπ≤Êâç) begun its push toward Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé) from Independent tree (Du Shu, Áã¨Ê†ë) Town, but the progress was slow due to the stubborn resistance from the 10th Brigade and the 11th Brigade of the communist 4th Column at Yueyang Village (Yue Yang Zhuang, Â≤≥Êù®Â∫Ñ), Zan Village (Zan Zhuang, ÊòùÂ∫Ñ), and Northern New Street (Bei Xin Jie, ÂåóÊñ∞Ë°ó) regions. On November 24, 1947, the nationalist 134th Brigade of the 20th Division also begun its push toward Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé) from Nanyang, Henan, and after some setback at Pengyao (ÁõÜÁ™ë) regions due to enemy resistance, managed to link up with the nationalist133rd Brigade of the 20th Division in the region to east of Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé). The enemy gave up the town without a fight in attempt to lure the nationalists into the mountain for an ambush but the nationalists refused to be baited and would not venture out of the protection of the city wall. Realizing the isolated was in danger being besieged by the enemy and thus suffering possible annihilation, the nationalists wisely decided to abandon Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé) on November 25, 1947, and retreated toward Wuyang (ËàûÈò≥), and the campaign concluded with Square City (Fang Cheng, ÊñπÂüé) fell into the enemy hands for a third time, and this time for good. Outcome The nationalists suffered more than 12,000 fatalities in their defeat, and a total of eighteen cities and towns had fallen into the enemy hands. In addition, the enemy had successfully turned the guerilla base in the Funiu Mountains into a new communist base, furthermore, the enemy was successful in establishing several brand new communist bases and thus further threatened the nationalist reign in the North China Plain. The communist success was mainly due to the correct strategy of first luring the technically superior nationalist opponent into dispersing its forces into many smaller fragments, and then to concentrate overwhelmingly numerically superior force in one battle on a single fragmented nationalist force for annihilation, and eventually, accumulate many small victories into large ones. The result of the communist strategy was that a total of eighteen towns and cities fell into the communist hands, and the communists had established themselves firmly in the border areas of Henan, Hubei and Shaanxi provinces.

Its mission was to provide air support at fronts, and to protect Bratislava and metropolitan areas against enemy air attack. History One of the SVZ's first air battles was in the Slovak‚ÄìHungarian War in March 1939 in which Hungary reoccupied Carpathian Ruthenia and parts of southern Slovakia. In this the SVZ suffered some losses against Royal Hungarian Air Force. The SVZ also took part in the German Invasion of Poland. The SVZ took part in Axis offensives in the Ukraine and Russian Central front sectors of the Eastern Front under the lead of Luftwaffe in the Stalingrad and Caucasus operations. The engagement in the cost it great losses of aircraft and personnel. For the rest of the war the SVZ fought US Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force raids against Slovakia. The symbol of the Slovak air force was a blue and white cross similar to the German Balkenkreuz, with a red disc in the centre. It was carried on the tail and wings. Engine covers were painted yellow and there was a vertical line on the fuselage. Training aircraft were supplied by Germany and Italy. To defend Slovak air space, the air force used Messerschmitt 109 (E and G types), Avia B-534, and some other interceptor types. It was also helped by Luftwaffe units active in the area. When Romania and the Soviet Union entered Slovakia, with some captured aircraft and defectors they organized a local Insurgent Air Force to continue the fight against Axis forces in country. Others served voluntarily in Luftwaffe units; later these air units were integrated to the reconstituted Czechoslovak Air Force after the end of the war.

The substance makes impressive demonstrations when sprinkled on a white card placed on top of a permanent magnet, such as a bar magnet. The filings can be found in toys that allow one to draw with a magnetic pen. By sprinkling fine iron on a magnetic stripe card, it is possible to see the magnetic encoding on the stripe.

It was extremely popular in Venezuela, due to its very realistic approach to the day-to-day life of the country and local tone. It was the first Venezuelan program to give a realistic view of the corruption in political life, as well as the first to show the day-to-day life in the poor barrios. For example, it showed the impact on poor people's lives of the intermittent water supply, showing community meetings and lovers' trysts cut short by the news that the water was on, sending everyone running to fill storage tanks and barrels.Jones (2008:184) It was considered by the Spanish edition of the magazine Rolling Stone as the 8th best show between the 100 Best TV Shows Ever in all Latin America. It is believed to be the longest telenovela ever produced in Venezuela.Los 100 mejores programas de la TV (Spanish). RollingStone.com.ar. Retrieved on January 4, 2016. History In early 1992 Venezuela was in a very unstable political situation. At the same time, RCTV was in a low-rating stage. The network decided to take the risk of making a story which took place in the poorest slums of the city in a realistic fashion. Por estas calles began as a traditional telenovela called Eva Marina. During the pre-production stage, however, the concept changed from a traditional romance to a more actual, street-related story. The original chapters were wiped and the history, now under its new name and concept, began its filming. The name change took place after a meeting with Yordano about using his new song Por estas calles for the telenovela. Producers had realized that the theme of song matched the politico-social situations in Venezuela that they wanted to portray in the telenovela and decided to name the telenovela after the song. The telenovela was initially written by Ibsen Mart√≠nez, but he resigned six months later. It is believed that RCTV demanded him not only an extension (something very usual when a telenovela is very successful) but also a better ending for characters who were very popular but morally questionable, something he was not willing to do. Despite his absence, the telenovela lasted for another year under a team of scriptwriters, and when it ended it was still popular. Plot There was not a central story in Por estas calles. At the beginning, the main story revolved around the tribulations of elementary teacher Eur√≠dice Brice√±o, falsely accused of murder, who has to hide under a new identity. But the other characters soon took bigger screen time, and it became an ensemble story. During its runtime, the telenovela adapted many stories inspired by news headlines. One of the show's characters, Don Chepe Orellana, \\"bore a striking resemblance to former president Jaime Lusinchi, who in real life had of course been manipulated by Blanca Ib√°√±ez. On the show, Don Chepe and his mistress Lucha (Carlota Sosa) pocketed public money with one sleight-of-hand move after another, doled out favors to campaign contributors, developed all kinds of illegal schemes to hold on to power, and ruthlessly eliminated political enemies.\\"Jones, Bart (2008), Hugo! The Hugo Chavez Story from Mud Hut to Perpetual Revolution, London: The Bodley Head, p183 Characters The cast was one of the greatest and most memorable in the entire history of Venezuelan telenovelas. Many actors made their big leap to fame with this telenovela, although some of them never escaped from the type of characters they played for this production. Some of the most popular characters were: * Eur√≠dice Brice√±o (Marialejandra Mart√≠n): the main character. A barrio-raised school teacher who is falsely blamed for the killing of a man. She hides by taking the false identity of \\"Eva Marina\\". During the soap opera, she was romantically involved with a judge named √Ålvaro Infante (interpreted by Aroldo Betancourt) and, later, with the drug lord Sarr√≠a V√©lez. Although she was the protagonist, she was somewhat overshadowed by the other characters. * Eudomar Santos (Franklin Virg√ºez): an archetypical \\"barrio\\" man, who cared only about the present day and had no ambition or working disposition. Eudomar is a very opportunistic man, who knows his attractiveness and uses it as his advantage. His catchphrases \\"que es lo que est√° pa'sopa\\" and \\"Como vaya viniendo vamos viendo\\" became very popular, and very descriptive of Venezuelan idiosyncrasy. At the beginning of the novela he has an on-off relationship with Elo√≠na Rangel, but later he got another girlfriend. * Elo√≠na Rangel (Gledys Ibarra): a nurse and single mother, who has to struggle with her daughter and her boyfriend, her feelings towards Eudomar and Dr Valerio, and the hardships of poverty. * Dr. Valerio (Roberto Lamarca): an unscrupulous doctor with big ambitions and an overt passion for beautiful women, having many mistresses (Elo√≠na Rangel among them) even if he is married with a beautiful woman. He is basically evil, but in a mischievous and almost playful way, which made him difficult to hate. His main gimmick was that while he says one thing, his real thoughts were heard by the watcher. * Don Chepe Orellana (Hector Myerston): a rich businessman with political ambitions, and a penchant for breaking the law. * Natalio Vega \\"el hombre de la etiqueta\\" (Carlos Villamizar): an ex-policeman whose son was killed very early in the story. He then becomes a serial killer with a \\"punisher\\" attitude, killing criminals he considers beyond rehabilitation. He puts on the big toe of his victims a forensic tag with the word \\"Irrecuperable\\" (Unrecoverable); because of this the police (ignoring his real identity) named him \\"el hombre de la etiqueta\\" roughly translated as \\"Tag man\\". He blames Eur√≠dice for the death of his son, and pursues her. * Mauro Sarr√≠a V√©lez (Roberto Moll): a drug lord who likes to show his powers, and falls in love with Eur√≠dice Brice√±o. First appearing around the middle of the plot, soon became popular. * The Narrator: although the novela has no narrator per se, every chapter ended with a famous phrase, usually related to the main theme of the chapter, read by the veteran actor Tom√°s Henr√≠quez. * Roberto Lamarca as Ar√≠stides Valerio Controversy and Legacy The telenovela was initially received less than warmly. Many show-business journalists placed little confidence on the success of such a story, which was so radically different from both the classic soap opera and the then relatively new movement of \\"Telenovela Cultural\\". The telenovela was surrounded by a lot of controversies, mostly related to an alleged glorification of violence and crime, and with the ripped-off-the-headlines late nature of the story. One of the most notable controversies was related to a boy actor who played a street kid and who became a precocious criminal. The success of Por estas calles allegedly drove many independent producers into financial ruin, including the then powerful rival Marte TV, which attempted to produce a rival telenovela with similar themes titled El paseo de la gracia de Dios. Unlike Por estas calles, El paseo de la gracia de Dios was not a success, and lasted only a few months. Trivia * The opening theme song,Por estas calles, composed and performed by Venezuelan singer Yordano, became a big hit and topped the charts for a year. * It was the first telenovela that contained difficult themes such as corruption, drug trafficking, and children on the streets. * While promoting the telenovela prior to its debut, one of the stunts was a fake commercial for a brand of maize flour called Don Chepe. Many people believed that was in fact a new product, and tried unsuccessfully to find it in supermarkets. * In the 1996 comedic telenovela Los amores de Anita Pe√±a\\", starred by many of the actors from Por estas calles, many gimmicks of the latter were parodied, like the phrase of the end of the chapter. During an episode, the characters were transported to the Por estas calles era and met the characters they played then.

The native habitat of Lewisia species is north facing cliffs in western North America. Local Native Americans ate the roots, which have also been used to treat sore throats. Characteristics Lewisias are perennial flowering plants native to western North American habitats including rocky outcrops from the high elevation alpine to lower elevation chaparral, oak woodlands, and coniferous forests. They produce rosette-shaped flowers in a range of different colours. Lewisia cotyledon grow up to in height and width. About half of the species of Lewisia are deciduous, including the original Lewisia rediviva. Lewisia longipetala is the only semi-deciduous species. Some species, such as Lewisia cotyledon, are evergreen. Taxonomy Meriwether Lewis, of Lewis and Clark fame, is credited with the first discovery by a European or American of Lewisia, which was known to the local Native Americans as bitterroot. Lewis discovered the specimen in 1806 at Lolo Creek, in the mountain range that became known as the Bitterroot Mountains.

Lewisia rediviva has a large edible root and as a result became a food source for local Native Americans. The root is peeled before boiling or steaming; cooking the root reduces its bitterness. L. rediviva has also been used for medicinal purposes; chewing the root was used to relieve a sore throat. It has also been used to promote milk flow during lactation. For gardening, Lewisia species are usually planted in rockeries, because this mimics their natural habitat. Rockeries also provide the free drainage that lewisias need to prevent their roots rotting. They may also be planted in pots, though they need to be well drained and protected from sustained wet weather.

She is wife to fellow singer and composer Farid Rastagar. She sings in Persian and Pashto, She currently lives in Germany along with her husband & children, and she continues her career from there. Wajiha Rastagar was a student of primary school when she participated in the school‚Äôs cultural programmes. In the mid 1980s she and her band experimented with Synthesizers and therefore the sound of her music at that time had a lot of influence of British and American new wave bands like A flock of seagulls or Missing Persons. She married Farid Rastagar, who was the music arranger and singer in GULI SURKH. Wajiha Rastagar has been singing a number of Afghanistan‚Äôs songs among which range some Afghani folksongs. She came into focus again when she performed her album Delk-i-khoshbawar very nice. Delk-i- khoshbawar won the bestseller award in 2003 from KHORASAN MUSIC. Wajiha Rastagar has received the title of the Best singer of the year in Afghanistan and in Europe. Farid And Wajiha have been living in exile in Germany since 1992.

Christmas, 2011 Giorgi \\"Gigi\\" Ugulava () (born August 15, 1975) is a Georgian politician and the former Mayor of Tbilisi (2005‚Äì2013). He was one of the former leaders of the United National Movement (UNM) party and former close ally of the former President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili. On 10 February 2020, he was sentenced to 3 years in prison . However, on May 15, President Salome Zourabichvili pardoned Ugulava.  Early career  Born in Tbilisi, Ugulava studied at the Tbilisi Theological Seminary (1992-4) and the University of Saarbr√ºcken (1995-7), and graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy and Sociology at the Tbilisi State University in 1998. Having briefly worked as a journalist for a Tbilisi-based Iberia TV, Internews, and Transparency International (1997-9), he became a consultant for the Eurasia Foundation in 2000. He directed the World Bank Association of Legal and Public Education from 2001 to 2003, and helped organize the youth organization Kmara! (\\"Enough\\"). The Kmara movement played a critical role in the bloodless Rose Revolution, which would bring the reformist leader Mikheil Saakashvili to power. Ugulava assumed the position of Deputy Security Minister in the new government and was moved to the post of Governor of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti in September 2004. On April 20, 2005, he was appointed Chief of the Administration of the President of Georgia. Mayor of Tbilisi Ugulava was appointed Mayor of Tbilisi on July 12, 2005. When this post became elective in 2006, he ran successfully for mayor, and was elected by the Tbilisi Assembly on October 12, 2006 and re-elected through a direct vote on May 30, 2010. After the UNM-dominated central government was defeated by the Georgian Dream coalition in the 2012 parliamentary election, Ugulava was suspended on 22 December 2013 from his functions by a court for alleged misuse of funds. He was arrested on July 3, 2014 on charges of money misspending and laundering in the funding of his party's campaign in June municipal elections. His supporters accused the government of politically motivated persecution of Ugulava. On 18 September 2015 a court sentenced him to 4.5 years in jail. On 6 January 2017, Ugulava was released from prison after the Tbilisi Court of Appeal requalified the misspending charges, found him guilty of exceeding official powers, acquitted him of money laundering charges, and shortened his sentence by three years and three months. Shortly after his release he (along with several other senior members of the UNM) left the United National Movement to found a new political party: Movement for Freedom - European Georgia. The split occurred due to ideological and political differences between the elite and educated wing of the UNM, and its pro-Saakashvili populist supporters.

The result provides a simple framework to understand various canonical form results for square matrices over fields. Statement When a vector space over a field F has a finite generating set, then one may extract from it a basis consisting of a finite number n of vectors, and the space is therefore isomorphic to Fn. The corresponding statement with the F generalized to a principal ideal domain R is no longer true, since a basis for a finitely generated module over R might not exist. However such a module is still isomorphic to a quotient of some module Rn with n finite (to see this it suffices to construct the morphism that sends the elements of the canonical basis of Rn to the generators of the module, and take the quotient by its kernel.) By changing the choice of generating set, one can in fact describe the module as the quotient of some Rn by a particularly simple submodule, and this is the structure theorem. The structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain usually appears in the following two forms. =Invariant factor decomposition= For every finitely generated module over a principal ideal domain , there is a unique decreasing sequence of proper ideals (d_1)\\\\supseteq(d_2)\\\\supseteq\\\\cdots\\\\supseteq(d_n) such that is isomorphic to the sum of cyclic modules: :M\\\\cong\\\\bigoplus_i R/(d_i) = R/(d_1)\\\\oplus R/(d_2)\\\\oplus\\\\cdots\\\\oplus R/(d_n). The generators d_i of the ideals are unique up to multiplication by a unit, and are called invariant factors of M. Since the ideals should be proper, these factors must not themselves be invertible (this avoids trivial factors in the sum), and the inclusion of the ideals means one has divisibility d_1\\\\,\\\\,d_2\\\\,\\\\,\\\\cdots\\\\,\\\\,d_n. The free part is visible in the part of the decomposition corresponding to factors d_i = 0. Such factors, if any, occur at the end of the sequence. While the direct sum is uniquely determined by , the isomorphism giving the decomposition itself is not unique in general. For instance if is actually a field, then all occurring ideals must be zero, and one obtains the decomposition of a finite dimensional vector space into a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces; the number of such factors is fixed, namely the dimension of the space, but there is in a lot of freedom for choosing the subspaces themselves (if ). The nonzero d_i elements, together with the number of d_i which are zero, form a complete set of invariants for the module. Explicitly, this means that any two modules sharing the same set of invariants are necessarily isomorphic. Some prefer to write the free part of M separately: :R^f \\\\oplus \\\\bigoplus_i R/(d_i) = R^f \\\\oplus R/(d_1)\\\\oplus R/(d_2)\\\\oplus\\\\cdots\\\\oplus R/(d_{n-f}) where the visible d_i are nonzero, and f is the number of d_i's in the original sequence which are 0. =Primary decomposition= :Every finitely generated module M over a principal ideal domain R is isomorphic to one of the form ::\\\\bigoplus_i R/(q_i) :where (q_i) eq R and the (q_i) are primary ideals. The q_i are unique (up to multiplication by units). The elements q_i are called the elementary divisors of M. In a PID, nonzero primary ideals are powers of primes, and so (q_i)=(p_i^{r_i}) = (p_i)^{r_i}. When q_i=0, the resulting indecomposable module is R itself, and this is inside the part of M that is a free module. The summands R/(q_i) are indecomposable, so the primary decomposition is a decomposition into indecomposable modules, and thus every finitely generated module over a PID is a completely decomposable module. Since PID's are Noetherian rings, this can be seen as a manifestation of the Lasker-Noether theorem. As before, it is possible to write the free part (where q_i=0) separately and express M as: :R^f \\\\oplus(\\\\bigoplus_i R/(q_i)) where the visible q_i are nonzero. Proofs One proof proceeds as follows: * Every finitely generated module over a PID is also finitely presented because a PID is Noetherian, an even stronger condition than coherence. * Take a presentation, which is a map R^r \\\\to R^g (relations to generators), and put it in Smith normal form. This yields the invariant factor decomposition, and the diagonal entries of Smith normal form are the invariant factors. Another outline of a proof: * Denote by tM the torsion submodule of M. Then M/tM is a finitely generated torsion free module, and such a module over a commutative PID is a free module of finite rank, so it is isomorphic to R^n for a positive integer n. This free module can be embedded as a submodule F of M, such that the embedding splits (is a right inverse of) the projection map; it suffices to lift each of the generators of F into M. As a consequence M= tM\\\\oplus F. * For a prime element p in R we can then speak of N_p= \\\\\\\\{m\\\\in tM\\\\mid \\\\exists i, mp^i=0\\\\\\\\}. This is a submodule of tM, and it turns out that each Np is a direct sum of cyclic modules, and that tM is a direct sum of Np for a finite number of distinct primes p. * Putting the previous two steps together, M is decomposed into cyclic modules of the indicated types. Corollaries This includes the classification of finite-dimensional vector spaces as a special case, where R = K. Since fields have no non-trivial ideals, every finitely generated vector space is free. Taking R=\\\\mathbb{Z} yields the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups. Let T be a linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space V over K. Taking R = K[T], the algebra of polynomials with coefficients in K evaluated at T, yields structure information about T. V can be viewed as a finitely generated module over K[T]. The last invariant factor is the minimal polynomial, and the product of invariant factors is the characteristic polynomial. Combined with a standard matrix form for K[T]/p(T), this yields various canonical forms: * invariant factors + companion matrix yields Frobenius normal form (aka, rational canonical form) * primary decomposition + companion matrix yields primary rational canonical form * primary decomposition + Jordan blocks yields Jordan canonical form (this latter only holds over an algebraically closed field) Uniqueness While the invariants (rank, invariant factors, and elementary divisors) are unique, the isomorphism between M and its canonical form is not unique, and does not even preserve the direct sum decomposition. This follows because there are non-trivial automorphisms of these modules which do not preserve the summands. However, one has a canonical torsion submodule T, and similar canonical submodules corresponding to each (distinct) invariant factor, which yield a canonical sequence: :0 < \\\\cdots < T < M. Compare composition series in Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem. For instance, if M \\\\approx \\\\mathbf{Z} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{Z}/2, and (1,0), (0,1) is one basis, then (1,1), (0,1) is another basis, and the change of basis matrix \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\0 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix} does not preserve the summand \\\\mathbf{Z}. However, it does preserve the \\\\mathbf{Z}/2 summand, as this is the torsion submodule (equivalently here, the 2-torsion elements). Generalizations =Groups= The Jordan‚ÄìH√∂lder theorem is a more general result for finite groups (or modules over an arbitrary ring). In this generality, one obtains a composition series, rather than a direct sum. The Krull‚ÄìSchmidt theorem and related results give conditions under which a module has something like a primary decomposition, a decomposition as a direct sum of indecomposable modules in which the summands are unique up to order. =Primary decomposition= The primary decomposition generalizes to finitely generated modules over commutative Noetherian rings, and this result is called the Lasker‚ÄìNoether theorem. =Indecomposable modules= By contrast, unique decomposition into indecomposable submodules does not generalize as far, and the failure is measured by the ideal class group, which vanishes for PIDs. For rings that are not principal ideal domains, unique decomposition need not even hold for modules over a ring generated by two elements. For the ring R = Z[‚àö‚àí5], both the module R and its submodule M generated by 2 and 1 + ‚àö‚àí5 are indecomposable. While R is not isomorphic to M, R ‚äï R is isomorphic to M ‚äï M; thus the images of the M summands give indecomposable submodules L1, L2 < R ‚äï R which give a different decomposition of R ‚äï R. The failure of uniquely factorizing R ‚äï R into a direct sum of indecomposable modules is directly related (via the ideal class group) to the failure of the unique factorization of elements of R into irreducible elements of R. However, over a Dedekind domain the ideal class group is the only obstruction, and the structure theorem generalizes to finitely generated modules over a Dedekind domain with minor modifications. There is still a unique torsion part, with a torsionfree complement (unique up to isomorphism), but a torsionfree module over a Dedekind domain is no longer necessarily free. Torsionfree modules over a Dedekind domain are determined (up to isomorphism) by rank and Steinitz class (which takes value in the ideal class group), and the decomposition into a direct sum of copies of R (rank one free modules) is replaced by a direct sum into rank one projective modules: the individual summands are not uniquely determined, but the Steinitz class (of the sum) is. =Non-finitely generated modules= Similarly for modules that are not finitely generated, one cannot expect such a nice decomposition: even the number of factors may vary. There are Z-submodules of Q4 which are simultaneously direct sums of two indecomposable modules and direct sums of three indecomposable modules, showing the analogue of the primary decomposition cannot hold for infinitely generated modules, even over the integers, Z. Another issue that arises with non-finitely generated modules is that there are torsion-free modules which are not free. For instance, consider the ring Z of integers. Then Q is a torsion-free Z-module which is not free. Another classical example of such a module is the Baer‚ÄìSpecker group, the group of all sequences of integers under termwise addition. In general, the question of which infinitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free depends on which large cardinals exist. A consequence is that any structure theorem for infinitely generated modules depends on a choice of set theory axioms and may be invalid under a different choice.

It is an expanded version of the PlayStation Portable game Every Extend Extra which is, in itself, an expanded version of the 2004 freeware title Every Extend. The game runs in high- definition 1080i and supports 5.1 surround sound. It supports online multiplayer; Achievements; Leaderboards and GamerScore support; and online competitive modes. Gameplay In Every Extend Extra Extreme, the player controls a ship which can detonate at any time. This causes any enemies within a certain radius to explode, which in turn cause other enemies to explode in a chain reaction. As the game continues more and more enemies populate the screen allowing longer and higher scoring explosions. The player may halt the chain at any time to pick up power-ups (such as to increase enemy speed, add time, add temporary shield) or to start a new chain reaction. The explosions add a percussive beat to the background music. The player's ship is destroyed when coming into contact with or being shot by an enemy while the player's shields are down. This resets the level to its initial slow pace and bonus multiplier, therefore hindering the player's scoring. The game contains four modes of gameplay: E4: The Game Time Unlimited, E4: The Game Time Limited, S4: Wiz ur Musik (taps into the music on the Xbox 360 hard drive and creates randomly generated wire-frame visuals to move across the screen using bass and treble as their director), R4: The Revenge (a shooter mode where the players have to avoid certain enemies) Reception Every Extend Extra Extreme was met with \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 78/100 on Metacritic. IGN gave the game an 8.5 out of 10, describing the game as \\"unique\\" and \\"trippy\\". GameSpot complimented the visuals, stating \\"It's as much an interactive lightshow as it is a game, and the flashing, spacey visuals in combination with the pulsing, electronic soundtrack make it a hypnotic and singular experience.\\" Eurogamer was more negative towards the game, criticizing how easy it was to get on the top leaderboard and unable to do anything during chains.

An ally of Mikhail Saakashvili, Targamadze was one of the leaders of the United National Movement and the 2003 Rose Revolution. He served as Defense and Security Committee Chairman of the Georgian Parliament from 2004 to 2010, a period marked by tensions with Russia and a brief 2008 war over the breakaway province of South Ossetia. On 5 October 2012, the Russian channel NTV aired a documentary titled Anatomy Of A Protest 2, which claimed to show secret footage of Targamadze meeting with Russian opposition activists Sergei Udaltsov and Leonid Razvozzhayev to plot the overthrow of President Vladimir Putin. Targamadze and Udaltsov both claimed that the documentary had been faked.  Role in \\"color revolutions\\"  He is closely allied with President Mikhail Saakashvili, and in 2003, was one of the leaders of the Rose Revolution which forced the resignation of long-time president Eduard Shevardnadze, allowing Saakashvili to assume the office. He also traveled to Ukraine during the 2004 Orange Revolution, in which Viktor Yushchenko assumed office following an annulled presidential election found to have been fraudulent, and to Kyrgyzstan during the 2005 Tulip Revolution, which overthrew President Askar Akayev. In March 2006, Belarus accused him of a role in \\"an alleged election-day terror plot aimed at overthrowing the government\\", a claim the Associated Press described as \\"widely dismissed as scare tactics\\".  Defense and Security Committee Chairman  From 2004 to 2009, Targamadze served as Defense and Security Committee Chairman of the Georgian Parliament, during which time he frequently criticized the Russian government and military. In August 2004, Targamadze showed footage to journalists of Russian military forces moving to the border of the disputed territory of South Ossetia, a breakaway Georgian province that had declared independence. He called for a greater Georgian military build-up in response, calling Russian aggression \\"evidently unavoidable\\". In March 2005, he urged the Georgian government to develop a plan \\"to prevent any movement on Georgian territory by Russian servicemen\\" if Russia failed to withdraw from its two remaining military installations on Georgian territory. In May, following a unanimous vote by the Georgian Parliament to force the closing of the bases by 2006, he warned that Russia would face sanctions followed by more severe measures if it failed to withdraw. In July 2005, Targamadze accused Russia of \\"taking a direct part in an internal conflict in Georgia\\" through as many as 120 military intelligence agents on sabotage missions. In November, Russia initially denied him a visa to travel to St. Petersburg for a Commonwealth of Independent States meeting, causing the Georgian delegation to boycott the gathering. When the Russian State Duma banned Georgian and Moldovan wine imports in April 2006, Targamadze described the decision as \\"revolting\\". In April 2008, when Russia stated that it would consider military action if Georgia came into conflict with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another breakaway province, Targamadze condemned the statement as \\"aggressive\\" and \\"a direct threat to Georgia\\". Following an unsuccessful August war in South Ossetia, in which Georgian troops had been quickly repulsed by Russian forces, Targamadze headed negotiations for the release of Georgian prisoners. In November, when Erosi Kitsmarishvili, a former Georgian ambassador to Russia, testified before a parliamentary committee that Georgia had been responsible for the war, Targamadze threw his pen at the man and had to be restrained from attacking him. Targamadze joined his party in November 2007 in criticizing former defense minister Irakli Okruashvili, who accused Saakashvili of corruption after leaving office. Targamadze described the remarks as a \\"ploy\\" by opposition candidate Badri Patarkatsishvili. Later that month, he announced that the government was suspending the broadcasts of pro-opposition television stations Imedi and Kavkasia as part of a state of emergency declared by the president.  Anatomy Of A Protest 2  On 5 October 2012, Russian pro- government news channel NTV aired a documentary titled Anatomy Of A Protest 2, which accused Russian opposition leader Sergei Udaltsov, Udaltsov's assistant Konstantin Lebedev, and Leonid Razvozzhayev, a parliamentary aide to Russian opposition MP Ilya V. Ponomaryov, of meeting with Targamadze for the purpose of overthrowing Putin. The documentary purported to show a low-quality secret recording of a meeting between Targamadze and Russian activists, which NTV stated had been given to its staff \\"on the street by a stranger of Georgian nationality\\". The Investigative Committee of Russia (SK) stated it had found the footage to be genuine, while bloggers debated its validity, stating that at least one fragment of footage was used twice with different voice-overs. Targamadze stated he had not met Udaltsov, and dismissed the video as \\"propaganda\\" without further comment. Razvozzhayev attempted to apply for asylum in Kiev, Ukraine through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, but was allegedly kidnapped and returned to Moscow. Udaltsov, Razvozzhayev, and Lebedev were subsequently charged with plotting riots, carrying a potential ten-year prison sentence.

These salts are often produced by reactions of picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol). The picrate ion is intensely yellow. Explosives Many picrates are explosives, for example ammonium picrate (known as Dunnite). Some are used as primary explosives, namely lead picrate or potassium picrate which find their use as primers for cartridge ammunition. Picrates of some metals tend to be significantly more sensitive to impact, friction and shock than picric acid itself. As a result, storage of picric acid (or mixtures containing it) in metal containers is strongly discouraged due to the high risk of accidental explosion. Other uses Ferrous picrate is used in some applications as a diesel fuel additive to achieve better mileage.

A radical historicist, he has published many books critical of the central assumptions of Western philosophy, and has elaborated a robust form of relativism. His philosophical affinities include Protagoras, Hegel, C. S. Peirce, John Dewey, Ludwig Wittgenstein, W.V. Quine.  Biography  Joseph Margolis was the son of Jewish immigrants from central Europe. His father, a dentist, read widely in literature and was proficient in four languages. Margolis served in World War II as a paratrooper and was wounded during the Battle of the Bulge, where he lost his only brother, a twin. He studied at Columbia University, earning the M.A. (1950) and Ph.D (1953) in philosophy. His contemporaries at Columbia have included the art theorist Arthur C. Danto and the philosopher Marx W. Wartofsky. Margolis has taught at numerous universities in the United States and Canada and has lectured throughout Europe, in Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. Since 1991, he has held the Laura H. Carnell Chair of Philosophy at Temple University.For a list of the many associations of which Margolis is a member, see pragmatism.org In 1973 Margolis was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.  Philosophy  =Introduction= As set out in Historied Thought, Constructed World (California, 1995), Margolis holds that philosophy is concerned principally with three things: # what we assume to be the nature of the real world, and why; # what we assume to be how much we might know about the real world, and why; # and after having answered those questions as best we can, how we should live out our lives, and why. He sees the history of philosophy concerning these three questions of reality, knowledge and ethics as a gradual movement away from the idea that any of these three realms is changeless and towards an increasing acceptance of real change infecting all three spheres. Margolis emphasizes that legitimation is philosophy's principal task. Margolis defends the Protagorean dictum that \\"man is the measure of all things\\", arguing that all changeless first principles must give way to consensual, though not criterial, truth claims. Since \\"man\\", the measure, is himself a creature of history, no modal claims of invariance can possibly be sustained. Margolis further avers that there need be no fixities either de re or de dicto or de cogitatione. The world is a flux and our thought about it is also in flux. Margolis sees the whole history of Western philosophy as a struggle between the advocates of change and those who either, like Parmenides, deny that change is intelligible, or those, like Heraclitus, who find some logos or law which allegedly governs whatever changes are admitted. He has argued that cognitive privilege of the changeless lingers even in relatively pragmatic philosophy such as the work of W.V. Quine. Nonetheless, Margolis proposes possible modes of legitimation even under the ubiquity of flux. Contrary to postmodern philosophers like Richard Rorty or Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, he argues that our lack of cognitive privilege means that the need for philosophical justification becomes more, not less, pressing. Margolis began close to the so-called analytical school of English-speaking philosophy but his mature work draws freely on both analytic and Continental philosophy. In large part this disciplinary eclecticism reflects his ambition to overcome the apparent opposition between the naturalist tradition of analytic philosophy and the humanistic tradition of Continental philosophy. To achieve this, Margolis treats the \\"natural\\" as ontologically prior to the cultural, while emphasizing that we only know nature via cultural means, hence, that the cultural is epistemologically prior to the natural. This position is developed at length in his Selves and Other Texts (Penn State, 2001). His philosophical pursuits, expressed programmatically, are: # a critique of most mainstream Western philosophers, classical and modern; # the advocacy of a consistent form of relativism; # the defence of a radical historicism, which avoids the pitfalls of past historicisms, such as those of Hegel, Marx, or Michel Foucault; # and an account of how legitimation functions under his historicist conditions. =Themes= Margolis has published more than thirty books, on a variety of topics in philosophy. In Historied Thought, Constructed World (California, 1995), he argues that philosophy uncritically adopts the Platonic-Aristotelian view that \\"necessarily, reality is invariantly structured and, when known, discernibly known to be such\\". Beginning with his counterproposal - \\"(2.1) It is not in any way conceptually necessary that reality possess invariant structures or an invariant nature\\" - Margolis gradually traces out an alternative view. For instance, Margolis argues that Aristotle's discussion of the principle of non-contradiction presupposes the changelessness of individual things rather than providing any proof of the alleged law. In Margolis's view non-contradiction applies to \\"sentential formulas\\" and not to \\"meaningful sentences\\", since discourse in use may always offset any seeming contradiction via re-interpretation, as is routinely done in science (for instance, in the case of the wave theory versus the corpuscular theory of light). In other words, there is no conceptual necessity to accept a strictly bivalent logic; our logics depend, in a deep sense, on what we pre-thinkingly take the real world to be like. Hence, there is no reason to disallow relativism at all, for the world may well be the kind of place where incongruent judgments - judgments which on a bivalent reading would be \\"true\\" or \\"false\\", but are now no longer so, adhering to a many valued logic, one consisting of more than two exclusive truth-values - are all that creatures such as ourselves may ever hope to legitimate. Margolis goes on to examine reference and predication as our ability to probe and communicate the results of our probings. Constative discourse ‚Äì the making of statements of fact ‚Äî for instance need only rely on identification, and reidentification, of items for it to prove effective in use. Therefore, historical memory and consensus, together with a narratizing ability, are all that are necessary to ensure the stability of what we make reference to, there need be nothing essential at all in things themselves, for our constative discourse to be able to flourish and even thrive. Margolis inveighs against postmodernists of Rorty‚Äôs stamp, claiming that they risk disabling constative discourse in their objectivist fears of privilege. There need be, according to Margolis, no conceptual privilege involved in making statements, nor in the justifications proferred for the statements made. Still, Margolis emphasizes that justifications cannot be dispensed with, as any statement implies a whole set of beliefs about the way the world is and about how we know that. We must legitimize our statements as best we can, else we should never know why we should choose some over others, nor should we know how to proceed to make other statements building upon, but going beyond, our original exemplars. The key to how we in fact \\"go on\\" is to be found in Margolis's major postulate of Historied Thought, Constructed World: \\"Thinking is a History\\". Making meaningful reference within constative discourse is a thoroughly historical skill. What we predicate - about what is thus referred to - is likewise historical. Margolis argues that the struggle to entrench changelessness either in human thought or human nature or physical nature has, in large part, been a futile struggle against acknowledging the lack of any fixed-kind nature of the human being. It is futile, Margolis claims, in that we have no natures but are histories. Nevertheless, Margolis admits that there are enough man-made would-be stabilities and fixities to go round. There is the habituating weight of the customary, the slow change in human languages, the inertia of institutions. Margolis acknowledges that the historized \\"nature\\" of the human‚Äîand therefore of truth, of judgment, of reality, and the rest - is not his own discovery, but criticizes most previous versions of historicism as falling victim to some theological or teleological yearning, as in Hegel's Geist, Marx's utopianism, or Heidegger's history of being. In Margolis's view, the truth claims of earlier historical epochs are given their historical weight, from our own historical present, our own truth claims regarding theirs are subject to our own bias and blindness, but ours must still be legitimated as best we can legitimate them, taking into account as far as humanly possible ‚Äì though never overcoming - our limited horizon via self-critique. Margolis claims that five philosophical themes have gathered momentum from the time of Kant on. They are: # Reality is cognitively intransparent. That is, everything we say about the world must pass through our conceptual schemes and the limits of our language, hence there is no way of knowing whether what we say \\"corresponds\\" to what there is; what the world is like independent of our investigating it; # The structure of reality and the structure of thought are symbiotized. That is, there is no way of knowing how much of the apparent intelligibility of the world is a contribution of the mind and how much the world itself contributes to that seeming intelligibility; # Thinking has a history. That is, all we take to be universal, rational, logical, necessary, right behaviour, laws of nature, and so on, are changing artifacts of the historical existence of different societies and societal groups. All are open to change and all are the sites of hegemonic struggle; # The structure of thinking is preformed. That is, our thinking is formed by the enculturing process by which human babies become adults. The infant begins in a holistic space which is immediately parsed according to the norms and conduct and language they are brought up in. By taking part in the process, we alter it, alter ourselves, and alter the conditions for the next generation; # Human culture, including human beings, are socially constructed or socially constituted. That is, they have no natures, but are (referentially) or have (predicatively) histories, narratized careers. He embraces all five themes separately and conjointly, defends them all, and concludes that our future investigations of ourselves and of our world risk ignoring them at our own peril. His own investigations into \\"ourselves\\" have proceeded with a focus on a consideration of the arts as an expression of human being. In What, After All, Is a Work of Art (1999) and Selves and Other Texts (2001), he elaborated upon his earlier work on the ontological similarity between human persons and artworks. The latter ‚Äì defined as \\"physically embodied, culturally emergent entities\\" ‚Äì he treats as examples of \\"human utterance\\". Margolis argues that the cultural world is a semantically and semiotically dense domain, filled with self-interpreting texts, acts and artifacts. =Affinities and critique= Margolis has philosophical affinities with Hegel, Marx, Peirce, John Dewey, the later Wittgenstein, and Michel Foucault. From Hegel and Marx, he takes on their historicism without their teleologisms, or theories of some historical goal. From Peirce, he takes the idea of Secondness, the brute thingness of things which guides our sense of reality. With Dewey, he shares the conviction that philosophy should never exceed \\"natural\\" bounds. With Wittgenstein, he holds that \\"what has to be accepted, the given, is ‚Äì so one could say ‚Äì forms of life\\" (PI; 226). Finally, Margolis sees Foucault's \\"historical a-priori\\" as a fair replacement for Kant's transcendental a-priori. Margolis has extensively criticized what he sees as scientism in philosophy, singling out thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, Paul Churchland, Jerry Fodor, and Daniel Dennett as modern- day defenders of invariance.

It lies on the left bank of the River Medway in the North Downs. It is served by the A228, and Cuxton railway station on the Medway Valley Line between Strood and Maidstone. A low valley leads up from the river to the hamlet of Lower Bush. History Cuxton Library in 2008 Archaeological evidence suggest the first human occupation was around 200,000 years ago. A hoard of 196 handaxes from the Acheulian era was excavated in 1962. This is now displayed in the British Museum. The name is believed to have developed from \\"Cucula's stone\\".Judith Glover, The Place Names of Kent, 1976, Batsford. Remains of a Roman villa was found under the church yard. The Saxons occupied the town and it became known as Cuckelstane. The church and parish was given by √Üthelwulf, King of the West Saxons to the Cathedral church of St. Andrew, Rochester. The church contains much Norman architecture, and is unusual as it lies on a southeast‚Äìnorthwest axis. This gave rise to the rhyme, He that would see a church miswent / Let him go to Cucklestane in Kent. In Tudor times the principal house in the town was Whorne's Place, erected on the river by Sir William Whorne, Lord Mayor of London in 1487.

This was taken over by the Mashams, strong royalists who moved on to the Mote in Maidstone. The mansion was demolished in 1782 and only an outlying granary, now a house still bearing the name Whorne's Place, survives in 2011.

Famous for his involvement in the Enfield Poltergeist case from 1977 to 1979, he has subsequently been portrayed in The Enfield Haunting (2015) by Timothy Spall and most recently in The Conjuring 2 (2016) by Simon McBurney. Early life Grosse was educated at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London. After serving an apprenticeship in commercial art and design, he served in the Second World War with the Royal Artillery and was among those evacuated from Dunkirk in June 1940. Commissioned in 1941, he became responsible for the guarding and welfare of Italian prisoners of war for the remainder of the war. He married his wife Betty YasnyAncestry UK https://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi- bin/sse.dll?_phsrc=EbW24&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs;=true&indiv;=1&dbid;=8753&gsfn;=maurice&gsln;=grosse&cp;=0&msgdy;=1944&new;=1&rank;=1&uidh;=ix1&redir;=false&msT;=1&gss;=angs-d&pcat;=34&fh;=0&h;=48287679&recoff;=&ml;_rpos=1&queryId;=f2df3f696c5640a123e9d9f20baf2ea6 in 1944 and they had two daughters and a son. After the war he became an inventor, and he filed the first of his many mechanical patents in 1945. His most successful invention was the rotating advertising billboard. In 1961 Grosse founded his own design and engineering consultancy business which became responsible for launching many patents throughout the world.Grosse's obituary in Fortean Times Psychical investigator A personal tragedy launched Grosse into psychical research, when his daughter Janet was killed in a motorbike accident in August 1976. Following her death, Grosse reported that members of his family experienced a number of coincidences and psychic happenings, and this led him to join the Society for Psychical Research and The Ghost Club. In September 1977 he investigated an alleged poltergeist in a house in Green Street, Enfield, North London, that later became known as the Enfield poltergeist. Grosse claimed to have recorded many hours of audio and video evidence of the poltergeist while staying at the house for long periods of time, along with another psychical investigator, Guy Lyon Playfair, who later wrote the book This House is Haunted (1980). Sceptic Joe Nickell criticised Grosse and Playfair's investigations as \\"credulous\\". When professional ventriloquist Ray Alan visited the house and concluded that the girls were faking an allegedly \\"demonic\\" voice because they \\"obviously loved all the attention they got\\", Grosse was so convinced it was of supernatural origin that he offered ¬£1,000 to anyone who could duplicate the voice by ventriloquism or any other form of trickery. The parapsychologist David Fontana proposed that poltergeists could haunt tape recorders and speculated that a peculiar threading jam experienced by Grosse while playing tape recordings made at the home was due to supernatural forces. However, Tom Flynn, a media expert for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry examined Fontana's claims and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation. According to Joe Nickell, \\"Occasionally, especially with older tape and under humid conditions, as the tape travels it can adhere to one of the guide posts. When this happens on a deck where both supply and take-up spindles are powered, the tape continues to feed, creating a fold. It was such a loop of tape, Flynn theorizes, that threaded its way amid the works of Grosse's recorder.\\"The Haunted Tape Recorder by Joe Nickell Later life Grosse investigated many other cases, and served as a member of the Society for Psychical Research's Council, as well as being the long-serving Chairman of its Spontaneous Cases Committee. In 1995 Grosse was at a vigil in Charlton House when it was claimed that a piece of crockery materialised and shattered. In 2000 he recorded what he claimed were poltergeist knockings on videotape at the home of a family in north London. In addition to ghosts and poltergeists, Grosse also investigated numerous claims of precognition. He also put together an extensive collection of alleged examples of psychic photography. He continued this work right up until the summer of 2006. Grosse appeared posthumously in Channel 4's documentary Interview with a Poltergeist which was transmitted on 6 March 2007. He also made an appearance on the Channel 4 mockumentary Da Ali G Show in which he was interviewed by Sacha Baron Cohen. In 1998 Grosse sued David Baddiel for ¬£10,000 after Baddiel had described a psychic investigator called Maurice Grosse who lives in High Barnet, North London, and runs away with a married woman.Article from Daily Mail 15 December 1998 This was in Baddiel's novel, Time for Bed. They settled out of court and Grosse gave his sizeable winnings to charity.

The Carpetani (Greek: Karpetanoi) were one of the Celtic pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania, modern Spain and Portugal), akin to the Celtiberians, dwelling in the central part of the meseta - the high central upland plain of the Iberian Peninsula. Location Since the 5th century BC the Carpetani inhabited the Toledo and Alcaraz highland ranges along the middle Tagus basin, occupying a territory that stretched from the Guadarrama river at the north to the upper Anas (Guadiana) in the modern provinces of Guadalajara, Toledo, Madrid and Ciudad Real, an area designated as Carpetania in the ancient sources. Main city-states (Civitates) in the region were Toletum (near modern Toledo; Roman or Celtiberian-type mint: Tole), Iplacea/Complutum (Alcal√° de Henares ‚Äì Madrid); Celtiberian-type mint: Ikezancom Konbouto?), Titulcia (El Cerr√≥n, near modern Titulcia ‚Äì Madrid), Consabura (Consuegra ‚Äì Toledo), Barnacis (Orgaz ‚Äì Ciudad Real; Celtiberian-type mint: Bornaiscom), Laminium (Argamasilla de Alba or Alhambra ‚Äì Ciudad Real) and Alce (Campo de Criptana ‚Äì Ciudad Real). Towns of lesser importance were Aebura (Cuerva ‚Äì Toledo), Metercosa (Madridejos ‚Äì Toledo), Ispinum (Yepes ‚Äì Toledo), Miaccum (Casa de Campo ‚Äì Madrid), Mantua (Montiel ‚Äì Guadalajara), Thermida (Trillo ‚Äì Guadalajara), Ilarcuris (Horche ‚Äì Guadalajara) and Ilurbida (Lorvigo, near Talavera de la Reina ‚Äì Toledo). The exact location of the remaining Carpetanian towns is either uncertain or unknown, this is true in the cases of DipoLivy, Ab Urbe Condita, 39: 30.

Culture In archeological terms, it is now believed that they stemmed from both the transitional Late Bronze Age/early Iron Age ‚ÄòCampi√±as de Madrid‚Äô farmers‚Äô and the ‚ÄòCogotas I‚Äô cultural groups. Only a few Carpetanian towns appear to have issued their own currency, modelled after Roman patterns copied directly or adapted via Celtiberian coinage. In the 2nd century BC, Iplacea/Complutum and Barnacis struck coins with their names marked in Celtiberian script, whilst later Toletum struck theirs bearing its name in Latin script.Jes√∫s Corrobles Santos, Los Carpetanos, in Prehistoria y Protohistoria de la Meseta Sur‚Ä¶ (2007), pp. 194-195. History By the later part of the 3rd century BC, the Carpetani had evolved into a sort of federation or loose tribal confederacy whose nominal capital was set at Toletum, with several centres of power in the main towns ruled by petty kings (Latin: Reguli). Some of these Rulers appear to have risen to prominence in the early 2nd century BC ‚Äì one king Hilernus led a coalition of Carpetani, Vaccaei, Vettones and Celtiberians against consul Marcus Fulvius near Toletum in 193 BC, but he was defeated in battle and captured;Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 37: 7, 6. another Regulus, Thurrus, ruler of Alce signed a treaty with Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus the Elder in 179 BC.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 29: 40, 49. Prior to the Second Punic War, they opposed Carthaginian expansion in central Spain, but in 219 BC Hannibal defeated a combined force of Vaccaei, Olcades and Carpetani,Polybius, Istorion, III, 13-14. thus completing his conquest of Hispania south of the Ebro with the exception of Saguntum.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, 21: 5, 2. They also provided mercenary troops to the Carthaginian armies, for Frontinus mentions the desertion of 3,000 Carpetani warriors from Hannibal‚Äôs army when he entered in Italy after crossing the Alps.Frontinus, Stratagemata, II, 7.

While MM-1 looks much like a Milkor MGL grenade launcher with a larger cylinder, it was adapted from the Manville machine projector, a revolver-type 18-shot tear gas gun, developed in USA for police use before the Second World War. Michael Rogak, maker of the Rogak P-18 pistol, upsized the Manville design to 40mm and made certain design changes. One innovation was Rogak's development of a button rifling procedure for the aluminum barrel. This increased the speed of production while reducing costs. Subsequently, Rogak and a few others formed Hawk Engineering and began production of the MM-1. The MM-1 is a revolver-type weapon, with the heavy cylinder being rotated for each shot by the clockwork-type spring. The spring is wound manually during the reloading.

The US release of the game is called Wings Over Europe: Cold War Gone Hot, however, the tag line is changed to Wings Over Europe: Soviet Invasion for the European market. The time period covered is 1962 to 1984. The game includes a wide variety of real jets and weapons from the era which can be employed in various mission types such as Combat Air Patrol, Interception, Close Air Support, Iron Hand, Wild Weasel, and Reconnaissance. The game is based on the Strike Fighters: Project 1 engine and was developed by Third Wire Productions. In 2009, an updated version for the Windows Vista platform called Strike Fighters 2 Europe was released. The original game, however, is still compatible with Vista and Windows 7.  Background  Wings Over Europe was released in 2006 and was the fourth in a series of \\"Lite\\" Flight Simulators. The term \\"Lite\\" was applied because they are designed to be relatively easy to learn and play compared to other more hardcore types of flight simulator. The developer took and improved on its existing Strike Fighters game engine and thus the game was another step forward in terms of quality and game play. The game included better graphics, more planes, improved campaigns, and simulated clouds.  Gameplay  Despite the \\"Lite\\" tag, a fair amount of realism has been built in; 1960s-style bombsights are simulated for the pre 1970's aircraft rather than modern computer-aided aiming reticules. Dive bombing and level bombing techniques have to be worked out by the game player if they are to have success at completing missions. Aircraft that come into service after 1970 have advanced Head Up Displays that allow the player to aim bombs with more accuracy than manual dive bombing techniques. Laser Guided bombs such as the GBU-12 Paveway are included; so are the A and B versions of the AGM-65 Maverick, allowing much easier ground target destruction for the late 1970s aircraft. US Air to Air missiles in the game consist of versions of the AIM-9 Sidewinder, AIM-7 Sparrow, and AIM-4 Falcon which are simulated to be as unreliable as the real missiles were. So regardless of having a \\"good lock on the target\\" there is a good chance the missile will miss. Missiles from 1978 onwards such as the AIM-9L version of the Sidewinder are much improved and more likely to score a hit. Dogfights are usually close in affairs regardless of the time period, however as the Missiles get better over time, longer range kills can be achieved. The map of Germany has been scaled down slightly so that there is less time spent flying to a target, and also because air-to-air refuelling is not included in the game. The lack of water on the map has meant that aircraft carrier operations have not been included this time. During a mission the player will fly in a flight of aircraft in which the computer- controlled planes keep in formation as you fly to a target. This flight can be issued commands; attack other aircraft or ground targets, fly home if they are damaged, or jettison their drop tanks. As you fly many other computer- controlled aircraft will be up in the air and can be viewed as they engage in dogfights or bomb targets. Flying over Soviet held East Germany the player's aircraft will be met with a high level of radar guided Surface to Air Missiles (SAMS), and a variety of lethal Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA). The main SAMs are the soviet SA-2 and SA-6, of which early and later versions are included in the game increasing lethality accordingly. The player can select a fictitious campaign from either Red Thunder (1962), Red Hammer (1968), or Red Lightning (1979); each being from a different time era with different aircraft and weapons forcing the player to employ different tactics in each. Single Missions are also available, which can be customised to allow the player to practice with specific aircraft and weapons.  Development  This series of games is designed by Tsuyoshi Kawahito (known as 'TK'), who was also involved in some of the 1990s best selling PC flight simulators, including European Air War (1998) by MicroProse and Longbow 2 (1997) by Jane's Combat Simulations.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

It is based on lectures he gave at the University of Nottingham and Yale and on some other papers. Publication information It was published in 2000 by Yale University Press and issued in paperback in 2001 . There are 17 citations in Google Scholar Synopsis In 1. Theology in the University Polkinghorne suggests that \\"the essential purpose of a University is the discovery and propagation of knowledge\\"(p4) and that universities are institutionalised expressions of the beliefs in the value of knowledge for knowledge's sake and the essential unity of all knowledge. He says that quantum theory illustrates the principle \\"Do not make common sense the measure of everything but be prepared to recognise aspects of reality in those modes that are intrinsic to their natures, however strange these modes may at first sight be.\\"(p7). He argues that personal experience is a fundamental aspect of reality and that the human intuition of an infinite Reality is another fact about humanity and that one of the roles of theology is the intellectual study of the religious dimension of personal experience (p19), whilst theological metaphysics can offer a more profound understanding of reality (p22) In 2. Motivations for Belief he rejects simplistic accounts of science, commending instead the approach of Michael Polanyi. He points out that the laws of nature operate all the time, but that understanding is only possible if we have access to regimes that are particularly transparent to our enquiry (p36) and suggests that God is always there, but there have been particular moments in history that have been unusually open to the divine presence, and that Scripture is evidence, the record of foundational spiritual experience (p37). He expounds the doctrine of the Trinity and commends John Zizioulas's Being as Communion. In 3. The Role of Revelation he suggests that \\"revelation bears an analogy with the role played by observations and experiment in science\\"Citing for further explanation of this view his books Reason and Reality Ch 4 & 5, and Science and Christian Belief/The Faith of a Physicist Ch 2 and that the pursuit of simplicity through studying extreme conditions (such as Deep inelastic scattering) is an important part of science. He also suggests that the fact that the Bible is still read with attention and spiritual profit by so many people so long after it was written is a fact that should be taken into account. (p56) In 4. Design in Biology? he discusses the Anthropic Principle and in addition to the well-explored physicist perspective he commends the explorations of Michael Denton of properties of the physical world that seem to be tuned to life's necessitiesciting Michael Denton Nature's Destiny Free Press 1998 and the Nobel-prizewinner Christian de Duve's assertion \\"to Monod's famous sentence 'The universe was not pregnant with life, nor the biosphere with man,' I reply: 'You are wrong. they were.'\\"Christian de Duve, Vital Dust Basic Books 1995 and also discusses with caution Michael Behe's claims about irreducible complexity. In 5. Second Thoughts he modifies some of his earlier positions somewhat, especially in relation to multiverse theory. In 6. Kenotic Creation and Divine Action he discusses Arthur Peacocke and the nature of causality In 7. Natural Science Temporality and Divine Action he identifies \\"four different metascientific accounts of the nature of time, each claiming to derive from contemporary physics\\"Op. cit. p131 In 8. Contemporaries he discusses the ideas of Wolfhart Pannenberg, Thomas F. Torrance and Paul Davies In 9. Science and Theology in England he sketches \\"the long English history of interaction between theology and science\\" from Robert Grosseteste via Francis Bacon, Thomas Browne and Robert Boyle, citing Charles Kingsley, Aubrey Moore and Frederick Temple who \\"all played an important part in welcoming the insights of Charles Darwin\\"op. cit. pp196-197 and noting that the great British physicists of the 19th Century \\"Faraday, Maxwell, Kelvin and Stokes were all men of deep religious faith\\" (p198).

Aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes function to remove toxic aldehydes that are generated by the metabolism of alcohol and by lipid peroxidation.  Structure  The ALDH3A2 belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily and is a membrane-associated protein typically containing 485 residues. The mature protein functions as a dimer. The structure was resolved using X-ray crystallography at 2.1 Angstrom resolution. It contains an element in the C-terminal region referred to as a \\"gatekeeper\\" helix, which is adjacent to the membrane-anchored transmembrane domain and the catalytic core. The gatekeeper helix appears to control access of molecular substrates to the catalytic core and allows efficient transit between membranes and catalytic sites.  Function  ALDH3A2 catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes into fatty acids. It is known to act on a variety of both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic aldehydes between 6 and 24 carbons in length, as well as dihydrophytal, a 20-carbon branched chain aldehyde. It requires NAD+ as a co-factor. The encoded enzyme is responsible for conversion of the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) degradation product hexadecenal to hexadecenoic acid. ALD3H2 is expressed in the human liver and has been found to localize the microsome fraction inside the cell. At least two alternative splicing isoforms of ALDH3A2 are known to exist. The alternative transcript differs by an additional exon and anchors differently to the endoplasmic reticulum vs. the peroxisome  Clinical significance  Mutations and deletions of in the ALDH3A2 gene have been widely associated with the autosomal recessive Sj√∂gren-Larsson syndrome, an autosomal recessive neurocutaneous disease. Multiple mutations have been found in different families, including those that molecularly disrupts the protein dimerization interface or reduces mRNA stability. Absence or insufficiency of ALDH3A2 protein products in mutant cells are known to cause abnormal metabolism of sphingosine 1-phosphate to ether-linked glycerolipids and the abnormal accumulation of lipid precursors.

However, Aechmea mulfordii is a large terrestrial plant, growing near the sea level on sand dunes.Martinelli, G., Magalh√£es Vieira, C., Gonzalez, M., Leitman, P., Piratininga, A.

The leaves may grow to 1 m (3 ft) in length, at times much less, and form a central vase, which, in cultivation, should be kept filled with water. On this species, the primary bract greatly exceeds the lowermost branch. The flower-spikes sent up from the heart or crown of the plant are red panicle with the three outer sepaloid segments longer than the three inner or petaloid ones. Frequently confused with A. rubens and A. emmerichiae, A. mulfordii has less dense and elaborate inflorescence than A. rubens and the long, broad floral bracts conceal the ovary. Etymology The name of the genus Aechmea has been given by taxonomists because of the characteristically sharp points of the sepals and of the bracts covering the flower buds. The word aechmea comes from the Greek word \\"aichme\\" which means \\"spear tip\\".

Plot summary Edwer Thissell, the new consul from Earth to the planet Sirene, has trouble adjusting to the local culture. The Sirenese cover their faces and heads with exquisitely crafted masks that indicate their social status (strakh) and mood. They also communicate by singing, accompanying themselves with one of a score of musical instruments, selected based on the social situation and feelings. Furthermore, errors of etiquette may prove fatal. Thissell is a clumsy musician and lacks confidence in the alien society, so he is forced to wear a lowly Moon Moth mask. One day, he receives an alert to arrest a notorious assassin named Haxo Angmark, who is due on the next starship. Thissell, however, gets the message too late. He races to the spaceport, but Angmark, thoroughly comfortable with Sirenese customs, has already landed and disappeared. Thissell commits a number of serious social blunders in his haste to reach the spaceport and in enquiring after Angmark. The next morning, Thissell is shown the body of an offworlder. He concludes that, since the fugitive would be unable to pass himself off as a native, Angmark must have killed and taken the place of one of the other three expatriates on the planet. But since even they wear masks, how is Thissell to know which one? Eventually, Thissell solves the mystery by borrowing a slave from each of the suspects and determining their masters' mask preferences before and after Angmark's arrival. He succeeds in identifying his quarry, but is captured and forced to walk unmasked in public (the ultimate humiliation to the natives), while Angmark masquerades as Thissell by wearing his Moon Moth mask. However, the Sirenese turn on Angmark and kill him for the perversion of unmasking another man and, ironically, for Thissell's previous gaffes. Thinking quickly, Thissell cleverly represents his humiliation as an act of unsurpassed bravery, asking if any present would be willing to be so shamed in order to destroy his enemy. With his new-found confidence, Thissell receives offers of gifts (the acceptance of which would enhance the prestige of both the giver and the recipient). He first goes with a mask maker to procure a covering more befitting his lofty new strakh.

Certain characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, although the nature of Jack, Ianto and Toshiko's sexual flexibility is not discussed explicitly. In addition to this, there is some discussion of the value of human life, the corrupting nature of power and of existentialism through parallels drawn between characters with the repetition of thematically important lines in the course of series one, although series two saw a significant shift from the original theme of corruption to one of redemption. Homosexuality and bisexuality Torchwood deals with several LGBT themes, specifically bisexuality. Each of the main characters in Torchwood has same- sex encounters at some point in the first season. Series creator Russell T. Davies has said that he hopes to defy audience expectations of monosexual characters: Harkness' actor, John Barrowman, has said of Jack: Similarly, Toshiko Sato describes Jack as someone who'll \\"shag anybody as long as they're gorgeous enough!\\". The essential Cult TV reader writes that because Jack, Owen, Ianto and Toshiko's homosexual dalliances occur \\"without any debate or angst\\", they form part of an attempt to \\"naturalize bisexuality\\", appearing to \\"deliberately refute and deny... gay, straight [and] bi\\": \\"a progressive challenge to contemporary ideologies of sexuality\\". In \\"Everything Changes\\", Ianto Jones jokingly refers to Jack's appreciation of his good looks in a suit as sexual harassment. In \\"Cyberwoman\\" the pair share a kiss, although it is essentially a kiss of life, it is not done in the normal way, and resembles a kiss of lust rather than of life. At the end of \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\", Ianto subtly presents Jack with a sexual proposition, which the latter appears only to understand after a few seconds - he accepts by telling Ianto to meet him in his office in ten minutes, once the rest of the team have left the Hub. This is again alluded to in the Instant Messenger Transcript provided on the official website, which represents a conversation between the pair in the time remaining before their tryst.Torchwood External Hub Interface - Jack and Ianto instant messenger transcript Ianto and Jack's relationship is referred to by Owen in \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\" when he calls Ianto Jack's 'part-time shag'. Their relationship is displayed for the first time in \\"End of Days\\" in which Ianto and Jack kiss after finding Jack is alive. Also during this episode, Ianto is clearly distraught when finding out Jack is dead, and smells his coat, reminiscent of gay cowboy film, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". This relationship develops further in Series 2 with Jack asking Ianto out on a date (\\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\"), the pair sharing an intense kiss (\\"To the Last Man\\") and Gwen walking in on them during some kind of sexual activity (\\"Adrift\\"). The other characters also allude to their relationship; most specifically Owen (\\"A Day in the Death\\") and Gwen (\\"Something Borrowed\\") and (\\"From Out of the Rain\\"). While Ianto becomes comfortable hinting on things going on while in bed with Jack around the other team members, he is uncomfortable to do so out of the Hub as Children of Earth shows. In Series 3 he gets uncomfortable when strangers suggest that he and Jack are a couple, is offended when an elderly man under Torchwood protection refers to him as \\"the queer over there\\". At first he even tries to avoid the subject when talking to his sister, before confessing that while he is not attracted to men in general, he indeed has a relationship with Jack. However, as the end of the 4th episode of \\"Children of Earth\\" suggest, Ianto was only able to tell Jack that he loved him when Ianto knew he was dying. Earlier in \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\", Jack claims to have had a sexual relationship with twin brothers, both acrobats; however, it is unclear whether he is speaking sincerely or simply trying to distract Gwen from asking difficult questions. However, in series two, Jack remarks to Owen that when you have been alive as long as he has \\"you don't make any more up\\" while they are in police custody in the episode \\"Dead Man Walking\\", implying that the many past relationships he refers to are genuine. In \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\", a subplot of the episode revolves around Jack's namesake's sexual orientation. His uneasy behaviour and his dismay at having convinced his girlfriend that they were in love combined with his flirtatious interaction with Jack suggested he was gay and trapped in an unwanted heterosexual relationship, unable to come out in his era. At the episode's climax, at a dance and knowing he was going to die the next day, the two Jacks danced and kissed, to the amazement of the 1940s guests all around them, before they had to part. In \\"Everything Changes\\", Owen Harper seduces a woman and then her boyfriend using alien technology. Gwen Cooper has a boyfriend, but she reciprocates the advances of a sex-driven alien in a woman's body in \\"Day One\\", albeit under the influences of alien-enhanced pheromones. Later in that episode, when the possessed woman attempts to absorb the orgasmic energy of various men at a sperm bank, one of them briefly protests that he's gay. Toshiko also exhibits bisexual behaviour: she has an interest in her teammate, Owen, but in \\"Greeks Bearing Gifts\\" she has a sexual relationship with \\"Mary\\". Religion =Existentialism= Torchwood contains numerous existentialist themes including the meaning of life and the possibility of an afterlife. Suzie Costello tells Gwen in \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\" that there is no meaning to life and that \\"we're just animals howling in the night.\\" The nihilistic Mark Lynch describes his fellow regulars at the Weevil \\"fight club\\" as \\"ordinary blokes trying to find meaning in a world that doesn't have any\\" - hence their hobby of cage-fighting tortured captive Weevils. Mark Lynch tells Owen that the latter are not aliens but what \\"we\\" (i.e. humans, or perhaps only men) will be in a thousand years, \\"when we have nothing left but our rage.\\" Toshiko also compares humans to Weevils when the pendant Mary gives her allows her to read minds causing her to fall into deep depression and utter disappointment with existence. The issue of mortality is also a common existentialist theme in Torchwood, raised through repeated discussion of and reference to the possibility or impossibility of an afterlife. For example, episode one features Jack questioning a recently deceased, though temporarily resurrected, man on the afterlife, who is shocked to discover he can remember nothing. Episode three, \\"Ghost Machine\\" presented the scientific view that ghostly phenomena were due to imprints of strong emotions on time. In \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\", Suzie Costello, a recurring villain, states she can remember nothing having been resurrected. She says that \\"there's something moving in the dark\\" and it is after Jack. During episode eleven, \\"Combat\\", Mark Lynch also tells Owen about something coming \\"in the darkness.\\" In episode ten, \\"Out of Time\\", Jack warns a suicidal man that on the other side there is absolutely nothing: \\"It just goes black.\\" In episode 9 \\"Random Shoes\\", Eugene Jones dies but remains on earth as a ghost until he has saved the life of and subsequently kissed Gwen Cooper, with whom he was in love: this done, he is able to \\"move on\\", ascending - the final frame is black; it is left unclear what this symbolises. In \\"Dead Man Walking\\", having been resurrected, Owen remembers nothing but blackness during his time dead, but he also speculates that the living \\"aren't supposed to remember\\", explicitly suggesting for the first time that there might be more to the afterlife than the characters remember and they simply never recall it because their minds can't fully process it (Similar to how Spock told McCoy in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home that it would be impossible to discuss what he experienced while he was dead \\"without a common frame of reference\\"). In the season finale, \\"End of Days\\", Jack expresses existentialist sentiments regarding the religious referring to the apocalypse. Continuing the ghost theme carried in several episodes of Torchwood, what appear to be the spirits of Lisa and Toshiko's mother appear, as well as Diane who may be dead or trapped in another time. Toshiko's mother warned of something \\"coming in the darkness\\", as Suzie Costello had done before. It is left unclear whether these were spirits or the machinations of the villain, Bilis Manger, as they urged Torchwood staff to do as he desired. In the episode's climax, biblical demon Abaddon is released from his prison beneath the Rift only to be defeated by Jack. This is contrasting with optimistic themes presented in parent series Doctor Who, where frequently the idea of life being \\"beautiful\\", and individual existence being significant is touched upon. Also contrasting in Doctor Who are the explicit examples of destiny and theism in the narrative, presented by the characters of the Black Guardian and White Guardian (both of whom are apparently representatives of an even higher power) and the Beast, who claims to have been imprisoned by a group called the 'Disciples of the Light,' a name that echoes traditional Christian and Zoroastrian theology. =Christian imagery= Although Torchwood has an existentialist view of life, there are several pointed moments with Christian symbolism. In one episode Captain Jack offers himself as a sacrifice to a satan figure to save the world, and his loyal followers wait faithfully for his resurrection. In the episode that explores how memory defines us, Jack's team sits around a large table in a tableau that recalls the Last Supper. One by one, Jack gives each the sacrament of a short term amnesia pill which will save them from the \\"death\\" of being filled with false memories that are threatening to forever alter their real selves. Of course, while Jesus said of his sacrament, \\"do this in memory of me\\", Jack's instructions are more along the lines of \\"take this and remember who you are.\\" But it is clear that Jack's sacrifices, his deeply professed love of his entire team, and his ability to forgive them for their trespasses against him‚Äî even Owen who has actually shot and killed him‚Äî are Christ-like attributes. This idea was further reflected in Torchwood: Miracle Day where Jack was briefly returned to mortality while the rest of the human race were trapped in a state of immortality where they continued to age, get sick and sustain injuries without actually dying; in order to save the human race from this state of potential perpetual agony and the rule of the mysterious 'Three Families' who had triggered this immortality, Jack allowed Gwen to shoot him in the heart in the final episode, triggering the reversal of humanity's forced immortality without Jack knowing if his actions would also restore his immortality in the process. Discussing similar themes in Doctor Who, Russel T Davies stated: > \\"The series lends itself to religious iconography because the Doctor is a > proper saviour. He saves the world through the power of his mind and his > passion.\\" Value of human life In several episodes, particularly revolving around the character of Jack Harkness, the value of human life is touched upon with Jack depicted as willing to sacrifice, murder and assist in suicide in several episodes. Episode four, \\"Cyberwoman\\", has him kill Ianto's girlfriend Lisa, with full certainty she was no longer human. In \\"Countrycide\\", he tells one of the cannibal villagers that he used to be a professional torturer, though of course this may simply be a lie calculated to intimidate the man. In \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\", Jack riddles Suzie Costello with bullets, claiming responsibility for her death - \\"Death by Torchwood\\". In the second season, continuing the idea of redemption in the series, Jack's newfound appreciation for life following his reunion with the Doctor is shown when he attempts to rescue the space whale from the group who have imprisoned it and are cutting up its flesh for meat, as well as his anger at Owen when Owen is forced to kill the creature out of mercy when it is further injured. In \\"Dead Man Walking\\", following his resurrection, Owen encourages a young boy dying of leukaemia not to give up on life no matter how scary the treatment might seem by telling him that sometimes death can be defeated. In the subsequent episode, \\"A Day in the Death\\", Owen convinces a woman not to commit suicide due to her grief over her dead husband by telling her that, if she can see even one faint glimmer of hope, life can't be as bad as she thinks. Although the team fails to prevent the Night Travellers from disposing of the last breaths of their victims in \\"From Out of the Rain\\", Jack nevertheless regards the mission as a success as they manage to save the life of a young boy, enthusiastically hugging the child after he awakens. Jack's compassion is further highlighted when he is shown to take care of those who have been sucked through the Rift in \\"Adrift\\", despite the fact that many of them have been horrifically physically and mentally damaged by what they have seen, preferring to help them enjoy the times when they are well rather than euthanise them. Despite his brother having become possibly hopelessly insane in \\"Exit Wounds\\", killing Tosh and (indirectly) Owen, Jack refuses to kill him after he has been defeated, instead putting him in cryopreservation in the hope of someday being able to help him, stating that there had been enough death that day. In Children of Earth, the government concede to the 456's demands for ten percent of Earth's children as the alternative is to be completely destroyed, arguing that such a sacrifice is preferable to the alternative. The government previously sacrificed 12 children to the aliens in the 1960s in an effort to appease them, a project in which they had Jack's assistance. In the present day however, Jack refuses to give in to the 456's demands, constantly seeking an alternative solution as he claims \\"An injury to one is an injury to all. After the death of Ianto and the realisation that he is in no position to bargain with the 456, Jack agrees to sacrifice his own grandson Steven in order to kill the 456, also destroying his relationship with his daughter in the process. During Miracle Day, when humanity becomes immortal, convicted murderer Oswald Danes is revealed to have a death wish himself- noting that he wants to go to Hell where 'all the bad girls are'- but nevertheless escapes when he learns that his current employers are planning to have him 'executed' by burning him alive, showing that his death wish has its limits and he does not want to die in agony. Despite knowing that ending the Miracle will end the lives of those they care about, such as Gwen's father Geriant Cooper and new team member Esther Drummond, Jack, Gwen and Rex all act to end the Miracle as they recognize that giving the Three Families who created the Miracle the power of life and death over all mankind is wrong, putting mankind's freedom above individual human lives. =Immortality= Continuing the theme of the value of human life, Jack's immortality is presented as a blessing and a curse. While he has often used it to save lives, such as entering dangerous environments or allowing others to kill him so that he can take action later, it is often implied that Jack would like to die, such as when he noted that he had never felt more alive when he was unsure if Lisa Hallet would be able to kill him (\\"Cyberwoman\\"). He also seems sympathetic when others wish to end their own lives: in \\"Out of Time\\" he holds the hand of a man who wants (but is afraid) to die, and in \\"Combat\\" he turns his back to allow Mark Lynch to surrender himself into the claws of a Weevil. Jack confirms his desire to die in \\"Utopia\\" when talking to the Tenth Doctor, but also states that seeing the Utopians as they fight to survive against all the odds has reminded him of what it means to be truly human. Despite this, Jack's immortality still troubles him at times, such as when faced with his daughter, Alice, who nevertheless looks older than he is and will die of old age while he remains the same (Torchwood: Children of Earth), and he notes that the process of resurrection is like being dragged over nails and broken glass. When the whole world becomes immortal and Jack becomes mortal (Torchwood: Miracle Day), society quickly begins to fall apart as hospitals cannot cope with the new injuries. Unlike Jack's immortality, people are simply incapable of dying while their ability to heal, age and/or become ill remains normal, resulting in people walking around with broken necks or new ally Rex Matheson suffering degrees of pain when he got a rebar through his chest on the day of the Miracle as he is forced to keep pushing himself physically; one woman is shown remaining conscious even after being crushed in a car compactor. The only means of killing anyone in this new world appears to be complete incineration, which is soon allocated for patients suffering from incurable conditions, such as Gwen's father who suffers a serious stroke after a series of heart attacks, or convicted criminals. In one episode, Jack discovers that an old lover of his, Angelo, had acquired a null field that allowed him to die despite the world's new state of immortality, but he disabled the field as he was concerned that giving anyone control of the field would be giving them control of life and death. Faced with the prospect of actually dying himself, Jack states his resolve to hang on to his life with everything he has (\\"Immortal Sins\\"), but willingly puts himself at risk to restore mortality to the world once the cause of this transformation is found, uncertain if his immortality will be restored at the same time (\\"The Blood Line\\"). Corruption Starting in episode one, with the character of Suzie Costello and continuing primarily with neophyte employee Gwen Cooper, the theme of corruption is present in the narrative, frequently drawing parallels between Suzie and Gwen. In the aforementioned pilot, Suzie comments on how you cannot go back from working for Torchwood, suggesting it has changed her, after she commits a series of murders and an eventual suicide. Later in the series, Gwen finds herself unable to tell her boyfriend Rhys about her double life, and finds herself drawn into a sexual relationship with teammate Owen in \\"Countrycide\\" - as had Suzie before her, revealed in \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\". Gwen laments that as Suzie had said, Torchwood had changed her, and in \\"Greeks Bearing Gifts\\", she explained to Toshiko that she knew what she and Owen were doing was wrong, but that she had no intention of stopping. In \\"They Keep Killing Suzie\\", the team is shocked to learn that Gwen is the only person other than Suzie who possesses a sufficient degree of empathy to operate the resurrection gauntlet. A resurrected Suzie explains she would drug people with amnesia pills to tell them about her life - in Combat, Gwen drugs Rhys as she confesses her affair with Owen so she can receive his forgiveness but not have to live with what she's done, echoing Suzie's actions. In the finale, \\"End of Days\\", after Rhys is murdered, Gwen fights Jack for the rift manipulator so that she may resurrect him, going as far as to hit Jack and even allow Owen to shoot him. In the episode's conclusion, with the rest of the team, she receives Jack's forgiveness as he understands she had been manipulated by villain, Bilis Manger. Characters other than Gwen have had their morality tested. \\"Ghost Machine\\" depicts Owen filled with rage after experiencing a young woman's rape, capable of murdering her rapist. In Combat, having lost his lover Diane, Owen succumbs to a nihilistic underground belly in which he attempts suicide-by-Weevil. In \\"Greeks Bearing Gifts\\" Toshiko, consumed with the loneliness of her job and feeling isolated amongst her peers, accepts a gift from an alien which allows her to read her co-workers' thoughts. Ianto, unable to let his dying girlfriend go, risks the life of his entire team in \\"Cyberwoman\\", even threatening to one day betray his future lover, Jack. In \\"End of Days\\", Jack berates his entire team for their destructive personal lives, at which point Owen shoots him, answering questions as to whether or not Owen is actually capable of murder. Redemption By contrast to the first season, the second season focused significantly on the theme of redemption, as characters grew beyond past mistakes to become better than they were. The most obvious example of this is Gwen's relationship with Rhys, as she now willingly admits to him what she does for a living and subsequently refuses to slip him an amnesia pill, thus increasing his involvement in her life. Owen also shows himself to be capable of rising above his cynicism in the first season, realising after his death and resurrection that life can be a wonderful thing after he discovers a message from another civilisation who detected Earth's old attempts to contact extraterrestrial life and sent a response. Ianto is redeemed within season one's story arc, his deception with Lisa slowly fading away as he proves himself dedicated and loyal to the rest of the team. Jack in particular finally learns how to forgive himself for a past sin- when he accidentally lost his younger brother Gray during an alien attack- when he is reunited with his brother. Driven mad by his long imprisonment, Gray buries Jack alive for over eighteen hundred years before Jack is rescued by Torchwood and put into cryopreservation in order to ensure that the timeline proceeds unchanged. Despite having spent hundreds of years buried alive, Jack's first actions upon awakening in the present and seeing Gray are to forgive Gray for what he has done to him. Even when Gray states that he will never forgive Jack for losing him, Jack, refusing to give up hope on his brother, simply chloroforms him rather than killing him, leaving him in cryopreservation in the hope of someday being able to help him. Even characters outside the main cast demonstrate the ability to redeem themselves; the earliest example is Tommy Brockless, a WW1 soldier suffering from shell shock and destined to be executed for cowardice, who sacrifices his life in his present to willingly spend nearly a century in cryosleep to await the day when he will save the world in the future, overcoming his fear at the last minute, thanks to his love for Toshiko. Beth Halloran, a young woman whose fiance is apparently killed in an alien attack, is revealed to be a member of Cell 114, a group of alien sleeper agents who program themselves with the identities of the races they invade to learn their secrets, but Beth nevertheless overcomes her programming in order to help the team defeat her 'comrades' in the invasion, subsequently forcing the team to shoot her to prevent her possibly endangering them in the future. However, the most prominent character to redeem himself is Jack's former colleague in the Time Agency, Captain John Hart, who originally appears as a merciless killer in \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\", throwing Jack off a building and forcing the team to help him by threatening to blow up Gwen. However, in his return in \\"Fragments\\" and \\"Exit Wounds\\", his new attack on the team is revealed to be because he is being blackmailed by Gray to set off bombs throughout Cardiff and capture Jack due to Gray having molecularly bonded a bomb to his skin. With the bomb having been removed, John risks his life to help the team rescue Jack and defeat Gray, subsequently deciding to remain on Earth in the present and learn what Jack finds so fascinating about this time period. Children of Earth forces Jack to confront an old sin from his past, when he was involved in a trade effort that gave twelve orphaned children to a race known only as the '456', with the 456 having returned to Earth and now seeking larger numbers of children. Although Jack is able to save the world, he is forced to sacrifice his lover Ianto and his grandson Steven to do so, prompting him to leave Earth as he is unable to cope with his grief. The Doctor Who episode \\"The Sound of Drums\\" revealed that the Torchwood institute itself has been 'redeemed' by Jack, with Jack having rebuilt the organisation in the Doctor's honour after the Battle of Canary Wharf and the Dalek/Cybermen war to be a more benevolent organisation that actively seeks to help humans and aliens in peril rather than regarding all aliens as enemies regardless of their motives for being on Earth. In the spin-off novel \\"The Twilight Streets\\", the character of Bilis Manger also goes on to redeem himself, revealing that his intention in awakening the demon Abaddon was to provide Abaddon with the strength to defeat the beings known as 'The Dark', subsequently enlisting the aid of the Torchwood team to stop the Dark in Abaddon's absence. As with all spin-off media, the canonicity of these events is unclear.

It was founded in 1987 to cater for years Reception to 10, expanding to cater for years 11 and 12 in 1996. The current principal is Mary Asikas, succeeding retired principal Peter Leverenz. The school is separated into three levels: the Junior School (R-6), Middle School (7-9) and Senior School (10-12). The school offers co-curricular activities for students to learn leadership and teamwork skills, namely school representative council, year level management groups, zone sport and music. The senior school (Year 10) takes part in an annual skiing trip and the Rock Eisteddfod, in which the school won in 2000. Brief history Late in 1984 the Southern Area Education Office commenced a program of consultation with the Hallett Cove community with the objective of establishing an R-10 school. In March 1985 a Parents' Reference Group was formed and in September of that year established itself as an Interim School Council. Hallett Cove School opened in February, 1987 as the only R-10 school in metropolitan Adelaide. Susan Monks was the school‚Äôs first Principal and there were 300 students from Reception to Year 7 on the first day of school. The school grew rapidly and classroom accommodation shortages and zoning issues were topics of conversation throughout 1988 - 89. Peter Jackson was the second Principal of the school and commenced duties mid-way through the 1990 school year. For the first time in its short history the school had all of its solid buildings available and all of its levels, R-10, in place. An opening ceremony for the school occurred on 17 May 1991 with the Hon. Greg Crafter, Minister of Education attending. During 1991 a reference group recommended to the Minister of Education that Hallett Cove School provide Years 11 and 12 education. The decision to add senior secondary education to the school was made in 1992. The school had its third principal, Jim Davies, appointed in 1993. Year 11 studies commenced in 1995 and Year 12 in 1996, making Hallett Cove School metropolitan Adelaide‚Äôs third R-12 school. A major building project occurred throughout 1995-96-97 to cater for the addition of the senior secondary curriculum. The School celebrated their 25th anniversary in 2012. School logo In 1988 the Principal Susan Monks, in conjunction with the School Council, initiated a search for a school logo. The brief was to have a simple symbol which reflected some aspect of Hallett Cove and the school. After a number of weeks and a large variety of ideas, the staff and parent bodies finally settled on our current design. It was designed by Art teacher, Dave Smith. The horizontal lines represent both the sea and the geological strata of the Hallett Cove Conservation Park and the sun as a symbolic reference to youthful aspirations as well as the visual beauty of our ocean view in the late afternoon.

This protein belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of enzymes. Aldehyde dehydrogenase is the second enzyme of the major oxidative pathway of alcohol metabolism. Two major liver isoforms of aldehyde dehydrogenase, cytosolic and mitochondrial, can be distinguished by their electrophoretic mobilities, kinetic properties, and subcellular localizations. Most Caucasians have two major isozymes, while approximately 50% of East Asians have the cytosolic isozyme but not the mitochondrial isozyme. A remarkably higher frequency of acute alcohol intoxication among East Asians than among Caucasians could be related to the absence of a catalytically active form of the mitochondrial isozyme. The increased exposure to acetaldehyde in individuals with the catalytically inactive form may also confer greater susceptibility to many types of cancer.  Gene  The ALDH2 gene is about 44 kbp in length and contains at least 13 exons which encode 517 amino acid residues. Except for the signal NH2-terminal peptide, which is absent in the mature enzyme, the amino acid sequence deduced from the exons coincided with the reported primary structure of human liver ALDH2. Several introns contain Alu repetitive sequences. A TATA-like sequence (TTATAAAA) and a CAAT-like sequence (GTCATCAT) are located 473 and 515 bp, respectively, upstream from the translation initiation codon.  Enzyme structure  The enzyme encoded by the human ALDH2 gene is a tetrameric enzyme that contains three domains; two dinucleotide-binding domains and a three- stranded beta-sheet domain. The active site of ALDH2 is divided into two halves by the nicotinamide ring of NAD+. Adjacent to the A-side (Pro-R) of the nicotinamide ring is a cluster of three cysteines (Cys301, Cys302 and Cys303) and adjacent to the B-side (Pro-S) are Thr244, Glu268, Glu476 and an ordered water molecule bound to Thr244 and Glu476. Although there is a recognizable Rossmann fold, the coenzyme-binding region of ALDH2 binds NAD+ in a manner not seen in other NAD+-binding enzymes. The positions of the residues near the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ suggest a chemical mechanism whereby Glu268 functions as a general base through a bound water molecule. The sidechain amide nitrogen of Asn169 and the peptide nitrogen of Cys302 are in position to stabilize the oxyanion present in the tetrahedral transition state prior to hydride transfer. The functional importance of residue Glu487 now appears to be due to indirect interactions of this residue with the substrate-binding site via Arg264 and Arg475.  Isoforms  Two major liver isoforms of this enzyme, cytosolic and mitochondrial, can be distinguished by their electrophoretic mobilities, kinetic properties, and subcellular localizations. The ALDH2 gene encodes a mitochondrial isoform, which has a low Km for acetaldehydes, and is localized in mitochondrial matrix; in contrast the ALDH1 gene codes for the cytosolic isoform.  Function  Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family of enzymes that catalyze the chemical transformation from acetaldehyde to acetic acid. Aldehyde dehydrogenase is the second enzyme of the major oxidative pathway of alcohol metabolism. Additionally, ALDH2 functions as a protector against oxidative stress. Image:Acetaldehyde-skeletal.svgAcetaldehyde Image:Acetic- acid-2D-skeletal.svgAcetic acid Image:Alda-1.svgChemical structure of the ALDH2 activator Alda-1. Ethanol metabolism in humans  Clinical significance  Most Caucasians have two major isozymes, while approximately 50% of East Asians have one normal copy of the ALDH2 gene and one variant copy (ALDH2*2, rs671) that encodes an inactive mitochondrial isoenzyme. In native Japanese, this variant ALDH2 gene encodes lysine instead of glutamic acid at amino acid 487 and therefore encodes a product protein that is completely inactive in metabolizing acetaldehyde to acetic acid. In the overall Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are homozygous for the normal gene, 40% are heterozygous for the variant gene, and 3% are homozygous for the variant gene. Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a tetramer and requires all four of its components to be active in order to metabolize acetaldehyde, heterozygotes have very little ALDH2 activity. Accordingly, individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the abnormal gene metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde normally but metabolize acetaldehyde poorly and are thereby susceptible to certain adverse effects of alcoholic (i.e. ethanol-containing) beverages; these effects include the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood and tissues; facial flushing (i.e. the \\"Asian flushing syndrome\\"), urticaria, systemic dermatitis, and alcohol-induced respiratory reactions such as rhinitis and the exacerbation of asthma bronchoconstriction. The cited allergic reaction-like symptoms: a) do not appear due to classical IgE or T cell-related allergen-induced reactions but rather the actions of acetaldehyde in stimulating the release of histamine, a probable mediating cause of these symptoms; b) typically occur within 30‚Äì60 minutes of ingesting alcoholic beverages; and c) occur in other Asian as well as non-Asian individuals that are either seriously defective in metabolizing ingested ethanol past acetaldehyde to acetic acid or, alternatively, that metabolize ethanol too rapidly for ALDH2 processing. A remarkably higher frequency of acute alcohol intoxication among East Asians than among Caucasians has been repeatedly shown to be related to the greatly reduced activity of the variant ALDH2*2 isoenzyme. This variant has a significantly distorted coenzyme binding site. During the 80's there has been a steady increase in the number of Japanese alcoholics who manage to overcome their genetically determined aversion to alcoholism from the dominant effects of an ALDH2*2 mutation. This trend demonstrates that, even among those least likely to succumb to alcoholism, there are social pressures to drink. An activator of ALDH2 enzymatic activity, Alda-1 (N-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)-2,6-dichlorobenzamide), has been shown to reduce ischemia-induced cardiac damage caused by myocardial infarction.  Interactions  ALDH2 has been shown to interact with GroEL.

France  =French parliamentary commission report (1995)= In 1995, a parliamentary commission of the National Assembly of France on cults produced its reportFrench report, 1995, English translation , National Assembly of France, Parliamentary Commission report. (in French: compare an unofficial English translation). The report included a list of purported cults based upon information which may have been provided by former members, the general information division of the French National Police (Renseignements g√©n√©raux ‚Äî the French secret police service) and cult-watching groups.The New heretics of France Susan J. Palmer, p 10 The criteria chosen by the French Renseignements g√©n√©raux to establish the potential dangers of a movement were criticized since they were considered vague and may include many organizations, religious or not. One of the first criticisms came from bishop Jean Vernette, the national secretary of the French episcopate to the study of cults and new religious movements, who stressed that these criteria can be applied to almost all religions. Moreover, sociologists such as Bruno √âtienne emphasized that the mental manipulation should not be defined by the policemen of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux. The list of cults was based on the criteria defined by the Renseignements g√©n√©raux, but without specifying which of their practices are specifically criticized. In addition, the secrecy of the work made by the RG led to questions about the presence or absence of certain organizations in the list. √âtienne questioned the presence of the CEDIPAC SA company, formerly known as European Grouping of Marketing Professionals (GEPM), as its activity is not in the religious field. The absence of Opus Dei or the Freemasons also raised questions. In 2007, Yves Bertrand, General Director of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux from 1992 to 2003, spoke about his collaborative work with the parliamentary reports on cults, and said: \\"Alongside genuine and dangerous cults practicing removal of school, abuse of weakness or pedophilia, some groups have been a bit quickly dress up of the word cult\\". Furthermore, on 27 May 2005, the 1995 list of cults of the French report was officially cancelled and invalidated by Jean-Pierre Raffarin's circulaire.The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored \\"War on Sects\\" Susan J. Palmer 2011 In France, Antoinism was classified as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary reports which considered it one of the oldest healer groups. However, in a 1984 letter, the French Minister of the Interior wrote that the movement was considered, from an administrative point of view, as having for exclusive purpose the exercise of a religion, thus complying with the 18th and 19th Articles of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. He added that antoinism had always been allowed to receive bequests or donations, which meant that its religious nature was never challenged. In addition, many anti-cults activists, associations or watchers said they had not noticed cultic deviances in this group. For example, when heard by the Belgian commission on cults, philosopher Luc Nefontaine said that \\"the establishment of a directory of cult movements (...) seems to him dangerous, because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as (...) Antoinism\\". Eric Brasseur, director of Centre for information and advice on harmful cultish organizations (Centre d'information et d'avis sur les organisations sectaires nuisibles, or CIAOSN) said: \\"This is a Belgian worship for which we have never had a complaint in 12 years, a rare case to report\\". Similarly, in 2013, the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances (Mission interminist√©rielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les d√©rives sectaires, or MIVILUDES) made this comment: \\"We have never received reporting from Antoinists. They heal through prayer, but as long as they do not prevent people from getting proper treatment by legal means...\\" In addition, the Renseignements g√©n√©raux stopped monitoring the religion given the absence of any problem. In 2002, the national service \\"Pastoral, sects and new beliefs\\" (\\"Pastorale, sectes et nouvelles croyances\\"), which analyses new religious movements from a catholic point of view, wrote about Antoinism: \\"Although listed among the cults in the 1995 Parliamentary Report, it has no cultish feature.\\" Similarly, the French sociologist R√©gis Dericquebourg, who deeply studied the religion, concluded that Antoinism is not a cult: it \\"has no totalitarian influence on its members, and do not dictate their behaviour to get in the world; it is not exclusive [and] shows no hostility towards social systems\\". In France, the 1995 parliamentary report listed the Shri Ram Chandra Mission. This has been criticized by lawyer Lawrence Hincker, who said that \\"this system of meditation, called Sahaj Marg, does not lead to a life away from the world. It integrates all aspects of man, whether physical, mental or spiritual, without charge or austerity or penance or self-negation\\". According to the sociologist Bruno √âtienne, an expert on religious issues, the SRCM publishes books as any other group but does not proselytize, and has never been convicted: \\"To us, it is fully a NMR (new religious movement), modern religious group, although based on an ancient tradition, and subject to serious arguments advanced by others more knowledgeable, we do not understand why it is criticized on the list of the damned\\". Rapha√´l Liogier, Director of the Observatory of religious and university professor at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques in Aix-en- Provence, said he did not understand the inclusion on the cult list of an association that is fully recognized in India. In May 2005 the then Prime Minister of France, in a circulaire, which stressed that the government must exercise vigilance concerning the cult phenomenon, said that the list of movements attached to the Parliamentary Report of 1995 had become less pertinent, based on the observation that many small groups had formed: scattered, more mobile, and less-easily identifiable, and that the government needed to balance its concern with cults with respect for public freedoms and la√Øcit√© (secularism). = French parliamentary commission report (1999) = The French Parliamentary report of 1999 on cults and money concentrated its attention on some 30 groups which it judged as major players in respect of their financial influence.

It is found in the SuttanipƒÅta (Sn 1.8) and KhuddakapƒÅ·π≠ha (Khp 9). It is ten verses in length and it extols both the virtuous qualities and the meditative development of mettƒÅ (Pali), traditionally translated as \\"loving kindness\\"Bodhi (2005a), pp. 90, 131, 134, passim; Gethin (1998), pp. 26, 30, passim [spelled as two words: \\"loving kindness\\"]; Harvey (2007), pp. 247-8 [spelled without a hyphen: \\"lovingkindness\\"]; √ëƒÅ·πáamoli & Bodhi (2001), pp. 120, 374, 474, passim; Salzberg (1995), passim [without a hyphen]; Walshe (1995), p. 194; Warder (2004), pp. 63, 94. or \\"friendliness\\".Kamalashila (1996); Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), p. 540, entry for \\"MettƒÅ,\\" (retrieved 2008-08-22 from \\"U.

Rhys Davids & Stede's complete list of general translations is \\"love, amity, sympathy, friendliness, active interest in others.\\" See also Gunaratana (2007) who uses \\"loving-friendliness\\" based on the Pali word metta's being related to the Pali word mitta (\\"friend\\") and that, for Gunaratana, \\"kindness\\" is more akin to the Buddhist notion of karuna (compassion). Additionally, Thanissaro Bhikkhu's translation,\\"Metta Means Goodwill\\" at accesstoinsight.org \\"goodwill\\", underscores that the practice is used to develop wishes for unconditional goodwill towards the object of the wish. The other, also chanted by Theravadin Buddhist monks at times, extols the benefits of the practice of mettƒÅ (Pali) and it is found in the Anguttara Nikaya (AN 11.15). is also referred to as MettƒÅnisamsa Sutta. This article will focus on the first version. Background In TheravƒÅda Buddhism's Pali Canon, mettƒÅ is one of the four \\"divine abodes\\" (Pali: brahmavihƒÅra) recommended for cultivating interpersonal harmony and meditative concentration (see, for instance, kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna). In later canonical works (such as the CariyƒÅpi·π≠aka), mettƒÅ is one of ten \\"perfections\\" (pƒÅramƒ´) that facilitates the attainment of awakening (Bodhi) and is a prerequisite to attaining Buddhahood. According to post- canonical Sutta NipƒÅta commentary, the background story for the MettƒÅ Sutta is that a group of monks were frightened by the sprites in the forest where the Buddha had sent them to meditate. When the monks sought the Buddha's aid in dealing with the sprites, the Buddha taught the monks the MettƒÅ Sutta as an antidote for their fear. The monks recited the sutta and felt better. Their good cheer then happened to quiet the sprites as well.See, e.g., Bodhi (2005b).Gunaratana (2007). Contents The MettƒÅ Sutta contains a number of recollections or recitations that promote the development of mettƒÅ through virtuous characteristics and meditation. The discourse identifies fifteen moral qualities and conditions conducive to the development of mettƒÅ. These include such qualities as being non-deceptive (uju), sincere (suju), easy to correct (suvaco), gentle (mudu) and without arrogance (anatimƒÅnƒ´). In terms of meditative development, the discourse identifies: * an intentional wish that facilitates generating mettƒÅ (Pali: sukhino vƒÅ khemino hontu; English: \\"May all beings be happy and safe\\") * a means for developing meditational objects (a list of various sizes, proximity, etc.) for such a wish * a metaphor -- of a mother's protective love for her only child -- for how one should cherish this meditation theme and guard it safely. (Note: this is often - indeed, almost universally - misinterpreted as a prototypical metaphor for the feeling we ought to cultivate toward others; however, this is not its intended meaning, as explained by Thanissaro Bhikkhu in the article \\"Metta Means Goodwill.\\")https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/metta_means_goodwill.html * a method for radiating mettƒÅ outwards in all directionsSee, e.g., Bodhi (2005b & 2005c).

It is located near the local railway station. In the 1960s a number of apartment buildings were constructed in the area and in doing its character changed in nature from industrial to residential. History Up until World War II Gammarana hosted a small airport. During the war many small military aircraft used the airport to ferry supplies and war materials in and out of Teramo. One street, Via dell'aeroporto (Airport Road), still bears the name of this transportation link. The airport has long been razed to make way for the residential building boom which followed the Allied victories. In the late 1950s and early 1960s several medium industrial enterprises were established in Gammarana. Included among these are Villeroy & Boch (a ceramics company which has since closed in the area and whose partially renovated factory is now a small concert hall), a candy factory (Confettificio Arcangeli, also closed and now a communications center for the Tercas S.p.A. newsgroup), and another candy manufacturer (Aquila d'Oro, whose factory was later transformed into Campo del re and today is the headquarters for the television show Teleponte). Previously located in the area was the recently demolished Adone factory (a small steel producer specializing in the manufacture of railroad tracks). This site awaits future development, so important for jobs and tax revenues to citizens of Teramo. In the year 2007 the old Gavini factory (a bottling company) is due to reopen as the Citt√† della Scienza (\\"City of Science\\") educational and research center. In future years a physics and astrophysics museum named Galileium will be colocated in this building. On the outskirts of this neighborhood are two public sports facilities. The area known as Acquaviva boasts several basketball courts, an open field used for soccer and rugby, a roller skating area, futsal, and indoor and outdoor swimming pools. A second area is called Camposcuola and is noted for its athletic field, tennis and five-a-side football courts. In recent years local neighborhood authorities have encouraged local students in the nearby elementary, middle and high schools to construct large public murals on the brick enclosure which surrounds the long shuttered Villeroy & Boch factory as well as posterior wall of the railway station.

Guy Victor Baring (26 February 1873 ‚Äì 15 September 1916) was a British Army officer and politician. He became a Conservative member of the British House of Commons but was one of 22 Members killed in action in the First World War. Background Baring was a member of the Baring family of Barings Bank, a younger son of Alexander Baring, 4th Baron Ashburton (1835‚Äì1889), and his wife the Hon. Leonora Caroline Digby. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards in 1893. In 1899 Baring's unit was sent to fight in the South African War, and he was present at the battles of Belmont, Graspan, Modder River, Magersfontein, and Driefontein, as well as the occupation of Bloemfontein. During the fighting in South Africa he was mentioned in despatches, and received the Queen's South Africa Medal with three clasps. Baring was the commander of a detachment of the Coldstream Guards in 1900 which went with the Australia and New Zealand Imperial Representative Corps to the inauguration of The Earl of Hopetoun as Governor-General of Australia. He was promoted to Captain in March 1901, attached to the King's African Rifles and was a special service officer with the Jubaland Expedition in 1901 against the Ogaden Somalis and was awarded a medal with clasp. In February 1902 he was gazetted as a Captain in the Coldstream Guards vice John Ponsonby, who had been seconded to serve in South Africa. Career He was elected as the Member of Parliament for Winchester in the 1906 general election, and was re- elected in the January and December 1910 elections with increased majorities. Although he had formally left the Coldstream Guards in 1913, he rejoined immediately on the outbreak of war in 1914. He was posted to Windsor where he commanded a training company, until July 1915 when he was posted to France. He served as second-in-command of the 4th (Pioneer) Battalion; and after the Battle of Loos he commanded the first Battalion of the Coldstream Guards. Death Memorial to Guy Victor Baring at Winchester Cathedral During the Battle of the Somme on the morning of 15 September 1916, Baring's Battalion were advancing along the Ginchy-Lesboeufs road to attack German positions, together with two others. It was the first time in history that three Coldstream Guard battalions attacked together, but despite advancing \\"as steadily as though they were walking down the Mall\\" the action took a heavy toll. 17 officers and 690 other ranks went into battle, but only three officers survived (one injured) and 221 other ranks. Baring was buried in Citadel New Military Cemetery near Fricourt. Baring is commemorated on Panel 8 of the Parliamentary War Memorial in Westminster Hall, one of 22 MPs who died during World War I to be named on that memorial. He is also one of 19 MPs who fell in the war who are commemorated by heraldic shields in the Commons Chamber. A further act of commemoration came with the unveiling in 1932 of a manuscript-style illuminated book of remembrance for the House of Commons, which includes a short biographical account of the life and death of Baring. Family Baring married on 16 July 1903 Olive Alethea Smith, daughter of Hugh Colin Smith and Constance Maria Josepha Adeane, and they had six children, including the cricketer Giles Baring. Their great grandchildren include the actress Rachel Ward and the actress and environmentalist Tracy Worcester.

He was the most highly acclaimed director of the early Nikkatsu Roman Porno era, with many box-office successes, and films regularly appearing on the yearly Best Ten lists of the mainstream Kinema Junpo and Eiga Geijutsu film journals. Kumashiro has been called, \\"the most consistently successful director in Japan's cinematic history,\\"Weisser, p.204. and Allmovie calls him, \\"arguably the most important Japanese director to emerge during the 1970s.\\" Life and career =Early life= Tatsumi Kumashiro was born on April 24, 1927 in Saga, on Ky≈´sh≈´‚Äîthe southernmost of Japan's four main islands. His father was a pharmaceuticals merchant and judo master descended from the samurai class. A strict disciplinarian, Kumashiro's father believed in the warrior philosophy of Yamamoto Tsunetomo as written in Hagakure and supported Japan's military exploits of the 1930s and 1940s. Early in life Kumashiro rebelled against this upbringing by immersing himself in film and Western literature. During World War II, Kumashiro entered medical school as a means of avoiding the draft, but dropped out as soon as the war ended in Japan's defeat. He studied English literature at Waseda University, but, deciding he could not make a living writing novels, entered Shochiku studio as an assistant director in 1952, and moved to Nikkatsu in 1955. Kumashiro worked as an assistant director and screenwriter until he was finally given a chance to direct in 1968. His debut film, Front Row Life, told the story of a stripper and her daughter who wished to join her mother's profession. The star of the movie, Hatsue Tonooka, became Kumashiro's wife later in the year, though the marriage ended in divorce within a few months.Weisser, p.137-138. Front Row Life anticipated Kumashiro's later career in its focus on striptease performers. The film was a critical success, but because it failed at the box- office Nikkatsu put Kumashiro's directing career on hold again. =Directorial success= \\"My films are about people not biology.\\" \\\\-- Tatsumi KumashiroWeisser, p.257. In 1971, facing bankruptcy due to a loss of their audience to television, Nikkatsu decided to devote its facilities almost exclusively to theatrical soft-core pornography. Several directors, not wishing to work in pornography, left the studio, opening up vacant positions. Nikkatsu gave its Roman porno directors a great deal of artistic freedom in their films, as long as they met the official minimum quota of four nude or sex scenes per hour. In this environment, at the age of 44, Kumashiro was given his second chance to direct. Though his later films took full advantage of Nikkatsu's lenient policies by experimenting with cinematic time and space in an almost surreal manner, his first Roman porno, Wet Lips (Nureta Kuchibiru) (1972), was fairly simplistic. However, this story of a prostitute and her lover on the run after killing her pimp proved to be a major critical and box-office success, and established Kumashiro's directorial career.Weisser, p.494. Wet Lips was also the first of Kumashiro's many films to use the word \\"Wet\\" (nureta) in the title. His next film, Ichijo's Wet Lust (1972) was another hit with the critics and the public. Japan's most famous sex performer of the time, Sayuri Ichij≈ç,Johnson, p.14. played the title role for which she won the important Kinema Jumpo prize for best actress. Accepting the best director and best script awards at the same ceremony, Kumashiro commented, \\"If I can shoot what I like without the pressure of how it will turn out, I am motivated.\\" =Mid career= For the next 20 years, Kumashiro directed a string of financial and critical hits unprecedented in Japanese cinematic history,Weisser, p.495. completing ten films in 1972 and 1973 alone. His prolific and successful career during these years earned him the title, \\"King of Nikkatsu Roman porno\\" Contrasting him with more mainstream filmmakers like Nagisa Oshima, who sometimes make use of pornographic elements in their films, Film Quarterly‚Äôs New York editor, William Johnson calls Kumashiro, \\"an indisputable maker of screen porn whose films also deserve 'serious' interest.\\"Johnson, pp.11‚Äì12. Kumashiro's work was noted for its humanistic themes and for its sympathetic treatment of its characters.Sharp, p. 139. Stylistically, his films were experimental, using a variety of avant-garde cinematic devices, and complex narrative structure. Woods are Wet: Woman Hell (1973) was an adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's Justine (1791). Jasper Sharp writes that Kumashiro uses de Sade's story as a platform for criticizing morality imposed by power, with particular relevance to the censorship trial Nikkatsu was undergoing at the time with the prosecution of Love Hunter (1972). Underlying this theme, common in Kumashiro's work, Kumashiro has one of his characters say, \\"What you accept as ethical is contrived by those in authority so they can control people.\\"Sharp, pp. 137-138. Kumashiro also employs censorship as one of the stylistic devices of the film, exaggerating the fogging required by Japanese law by placing black blocks over large areas of the screen.Sharp, p. 138. Lovers Are Wet and The World of Geisha (both 1973) were two more films in which Kumashiro similarly used the censor's tools to make an anti-censorship statement. Fran√ßois Truffaut called The World of Geisha (1973) a \\"great movie,\\" adding, \\"The acting is perfect, and the film is humorous. In its praise for female beauty and derision for male stupidity lies the generous spirit of Jean Renoir.\\" Street of Joy a.k.a. Red Light District: Gonna Get Out (1974), employing the same setting as Mizoguchi's Street of Shame (1956), illustrates Kumashiro's common use of devices such as internal animated sequences to situate characters, and enka songs to comment on the action. Kumashiro's 1974 film, Man and Woman Behind the Fusuma Screen: Enduring Skin (Yojo-han Fusuma No Urabari: Shinobi Hada) starred Nikkatsu's reigning Roman porno Queen, Junko Miyashita. Movie critic Tadao Sato called the film \\"a masterful porno film rich in emotion, anarchy, and nihilism.\\" Junko Miyashita won the Hochi News award for best actress of 1979 after starring in Kumashiro's Woman with Red Hair (Akai Kami No Onna) (1979), which the Weissers, in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films call \\"one of the very best Nikkatsu pink films.\\"Weisser, pp.514‚Äì515. Uncharacteristically for Kumashiro, Woman with Red Hair has a straightforward narrative structure, but Jasper Sharp writes that it is still a \\"difficult\\" film for viewers who are not familiar with Kumashiro's work. The story, in which a sexually voracious woman comes to live with a construction worker, can be read either as a male fantasy, or as a story of a woman's search for sexual satisfaction. Roughly one-third of the film takes place in the bedroom, with the claustrophobic atmosphere heightened by such exterior sounds as moaning from neighboring drug addicts, and non-stop rain. Sharp writes that it is perhaps best interpreted as \\"out-and-out fantasy\\". Kumashiro also took breaks from the Roman Porno genre to direct mainstream films, beginning with Bitterness of Youth (1974), a story of student radicalism with similarities to Dreiser's An American Tragedy (1925). Other such films include Light of Africa (1975) for Toho and Jigoku (1979), a remake of Nobuo Nakagawa's 1960 film Jigoku, for Toei. For the German-Japanese co-production, The Woman with the Red Hat (1982), Kumashiro worked with Pink Film producer-director K≈çji Wakamatsu.Sharp, p. 198. The production was an unsuccessful attempt on Wakamatsu's part to emulate the success he had had in collaborating with the French in Nagisa ≈åshima's In the Realm of the Senses (1976).Sharp, p. 199. The story, dealing with a Japanese man in Germany and his obsessive sexual relationship with a German woman during Hitler's rise to power, also seemed to echo ≈åshima's film. Jasper Sharp notes with surprise that Kumashiro, who had long been an opponent of Japanese censorship, did not take advantage of the more liberal European laws. Instead he followed the Japanese practice of obscuring genital areas with props.Sharp, p. 200. =Death= Throughout his life Kumashiro was a frail and sickly man. In the 1980s, as the rising AV (Adult Video) industry took away most of the audience for the theatrical Roman pornos, Kumashiro's health began failing. He suffered from a collapsed lung in 1983, but, in spite of his poor health, he continued making films until his death. He directed his last two films, Like a Rolling Stone (Bo no Kanashimi) (1994) and Immoral: Indecent Relations (1995) while using an oxygen tank.Weisser, p.206. He died of heart and lung failure on February 24, 1995. Kumashiro is remembered with affection by those who worked with him, and is considered one of the best directors to have worked in the Roman Porno series. When interviewed for the British television program, Mondo Macabro, actress Kazuko Shirakawa observed that it may have been Kumashiro's poor physical condition which helped him to portray the fragility of human existence. The Japanese film critic and filmmaker Chiseko Tanaka summarized his career with, \\"Kumashiro was not a great poet like Mizoguchi, Imamura and Oshima. He was a little poet, but he was unique. He devoted himself to his works as a true artist.\\"Tanaka, Chiseko quoted in Filmography * (1968-04-13)Filmography from \\"FILMOGRAPHY: Director Tatsumi Kumashiro (1927‚Äì1995)\\" in A Woman with Red Hair: A film by Tatsumi Kumashiro.

IGF2R is a multifunctional protein receptor that binds insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) at the cell surface and mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-tagged proteins in the trans-Golgi network.  Structure  The structure of the IGF2R is a type I transmembrane protein (that is, it has a single transmembrane domain with its C-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of lipid membranes) with a large extracellular/lumenal domain and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain consists of a small region homologous to the collagen-binding domain of fibronectin and of fifteen repeats of approximately 147 amino acid residues. Each of these repeats is homologous to the 157-residue extracytoplasmic domain of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor. Binding to IGF2 is mediated through one of the repeats, while two different repeats are responsible for binding to mannose-6-phosphate. The IGF2R is approximately 300 kDa in size; it appears to exist and function as a dimer.  Function  IGF2R functions to clear IGF2 from the cell surface to attenuate signalling, and to transport lysosomal acid hydrolase precursors from the Golgi apparatus to the lysosome. After binding IGF2 at the cell surface, IGF2Rs accumulate in forming clathrin-coated vesicles and are internalized. In the lumen of the trans-Golgi network, the IGF2R binds M6P-tagged cargo. The IGF2Rs (bound to their cargo) are recognized by the GGA family of clathrin adaptor proteins and accumulate in forming clathrin-coated vesicles. IGF2Rs from both the cell surface and the Golgi are trafficked to the early endosome where, in the relatively low pH environment of the endosome, the IGF2Rs release their cargo. The IGF2Rs are recycled back to the Golgi by the retromer complex, again by way of interaction with GGAs and vesicles. The cargo proteins are then trafficked to the lysosome via the late endosome independently of the IGF2Rs.  Interactions  Insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor has been shown to interact with M6PRBP1.  Evolution  The insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor function evolved from the cation- independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and is first seen in Monotremes. The IGF-2 binding site was likely acquired fortuitously with the generation of an exonic splice site enhancer cluster in exon 34, presumably necessitated by several kilobases of repeat element insertions in the preceding intron. A six- fold affinity maturation then followed during therian evolution, coincident with the onset of imprinting and consistent with the theory of parental conflict.

It was established in 1960 and was affiliated to the Shivaji University till 2015 after which it became an autonomous institute. The autonomy was granted by the UGC. Karad is a culturally vibrant town and is a sought after center of education in Western Maharashtra. The students and alumni of Government College of Engineering, Karad are colloquially referred to as GCOEKians. Over the years the college has produced about 10140 engineers and more than 700 computer professionals through a Master of Computer Application course in the Engineering faculty. Government College of Engineering, Karad is located in Vidyanagar, Karad besides Saidapur.  History  Government College of Engineering, Karad is one among seven engineering colleges established by the State Government of Maharashtra and first among those established post-independence. The prime objective of establishing the college was to impart technical education to the youth in rural parts of Maharashtra. Basically three institutes i.e. Engineering College, Government Polytechnic and Pharmacy College started functioning in the same premises. Other colleges were then shifted to their independent premises and the heritage building was retained by the college. The college was established in 1960 with undergraduate programmes in three core branches of Civil, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, initially affiliated to Savitribai Phule Pune University and subsequently to Shivaji University in 1972. Post graduate programmes (Master of Engineering) in these disciplines too were started in 1967. The UG programs in Civil, Mechanical and Electrical are ‚Äòpermanently affiliated‚Äô to Shivaji University. In response to the drive of globalization and industry needs, the institute started MCA (Master of Computer Applications) course in 1992. This was the only engineering institute in Maharashtra to offer the MCA course in engineering discipline. Subsequently, in 1995 all disciplines of the institute were approved by AICTE (AICTE established in 1994). With the boom in Information Technology, Directorate of Technical Education, Maharashtra (DTE) shouldered the responsibility of starting the bachelor's degree course in IT to cater to the need of meritorious students in this region and the new branch of engineering in Information Technology was started in the institute from 2001. In due course of time, the institute has also started an undergraduate programme in Electronics and Telecommunications in 2007. Currently, GCEK offers five UG and eight PG programmes.  Departments  * Electrical Engineering Department * Civil Engineering Department * Mechanical Engineering Department * Information Technology Department * Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Department * MCA Department * Applied Mechanics Department * Mathematics Department * Physics Department * Chemistry Department  Admissions  = Undergraduate = The admissions to the college are governed by the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE). The DTE previously hold the all Maharashtra State level MH-CET (Maharashtra Common Entrance Test), which was a compulsory examination to admission in engineering (from 2005 to 2013). From 2014 onwards, The Score of All India JEE Main (Paper 1) and HSC Marks shall be considered for preparing the merit and admission purpose (as per the Maharashtra Government Resolution Dt. 31 Oct 2012). Now the score of MHT-CET is necessary to get admission into the Government Colleges in Maharashtra, while the score of JEE Mains Paper-1 is only applicable for private Engineering Institutes. The ratio of girls students to boys students is 34:66. Being a government institute, all seats are strictly filled as per government norms. = Post-graduate = In 2013, Admissions are given on the basis of both GATE 2013 and DTE-held PGET-CET 2013 basis.

W. Parker Carousel is a carousel built in 1912 currently operating in the Burnaby Village Museum at Deer Lake Park in Burnaby, British Columbia. The carousel was built by the C. W. Parker Company and is also known as the Parker #119 and the Burnaby Centennial Parker Carousel. The carousel was the 119th such machine built by the C. W. Parker Company, earning it its \\"Parker #119\\" nickname. The carousel contains 41 horses and operates at a pavilion known as the Don Wrigley Pavilion located at one of the museum's two entrances, earning the entrance the name \\"Carousel Entrance\\". History The carousel was built in 1912 at Leavenworth, Kansas by Charles Wallace Parker who owned the C. W. Parker Company, and was the 119th one made by them. It was sold in 1913 for $5,886.00. The carousel toured Texas for two years with the Lone Star Circus. In 1915 the machine was shipped back to the factory. It is believed that the machine was rebuilt by the factory. Some fancier horses and heavier rounding boards may have been added. Some of the horses were built in 1917 and some in 1920-1922. The history of the carousel from 1915-1936 is unknown. The carousel was purchased by Happyland, an amusement park in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1936. The carousel remained at Happyland until the amusement park was demolished in 1957. It was moved to the new small pavilion in Playland, (another amusement park in Vancouver) until that too was demolished in 1972. From 1972 to 1989, Parker #119 was operated outdoors, and was put away each winter. In 1989 it was announced that the carousel would be sold off horse by horse at an auction in New York. Local residents came together to save the carousel and formed the \\"Friends of the Vancouver Carousel Society\\". It was at this time that the carousel was nicknamed the Parker #119. In May 1989, the Burnaby Village Museum agreed to provide a home for the carousel and the \\"Friends\\", led by President Don Wrigley, set about raising the $350,000 to purchase the machine. Keith Jamieson, a carousel expert, was brought in to coordinate the rebuilding project. In 1990, the carousel was purchased. Funds were also raised to pay for the restoration. People who donated money could sponsor a horse and later name it. The museum agreed to build a new pavilion to house the carousel. The pavilion, named the Don Wrigley Pavilion was completed in 1993. The carousel was then named the Burnaby Centennial Parker Carousel.

Some of the carousel's horses are not actually horses, but are listed as such for the purpose of creating a list on the carousel's horses. Examples of this are Horse #38, \\"Gold Heart Chariot\\" and Horse #40, \\"Wurlitzer Band Organ\\". Horse #37, known as \\"Old Paint\\", was sponsored by the Burnaby Village Museum and was not restored, as a reminder to visitors of the sorry state the carousel was in when the museum first acquired it. The horse was named for the \\"old paint\\" that was originally on the carousel before it was restored. The horse is currently in a display case next to the carousel. Horse #39 is really four small ponies and a wheelchair. This was placed to make the carousel accessible to toddlers and disabled people. Horse #41 is really two small ponies. While originally on the carousel with Horse #39, they were removed to make room for Horse #39's wheelchair and placed, one each, at the museum's two entrances. There were originally two chariots on the carousel. One has since gone missing while the carousel was under the ownership of a theme park. The ponies which now form Horses #39 and #41 were added to the area where the other chariot was originally placed. Horse #38 was also cut in half, removing the backdrop and adding more seats to the carousel (a plan to generate more income from the carousel by allowing more people to ride it, done by one of the carousel's theme park owners). When the carousel was bought by the museum, Horse #38 underwent restoration, adding a backdrop to it, making it a chariot once again.

(born June 26, 1965 in Abadan, Iran) is an Iranian-American writer who writes in English. She is the author of the memoirs Funny in Farsi: A Memoir of Growing up Iranian in America (2003) and Laughing without an Accent: Adventures of a Global Citizen (2008), and the semi-autobiographical novel It Ain't so Awful, Falafel (2016). Early life At the age of seven, Dumas and her family moved to Whittier, California. She later moved back to Iran and lived in Tehran and Ahvaz. However, she once again immigrated to the United States; first to Whittier, then to Newport Beach, California. She began to write and submit essays to obtain money to go toward college. She attended the University of California, Berkeley where she lived at International House Berkeley and majored in art history. Kazem, her father, dominates many of her stories throughout her memoir Funny in Farsi: A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America. She takes pride in her Iranian heritage, but at the same time, mocks her dad's fascination with \\"freebies\\" at Costco and television shows like Bowling for Dollars. Growing up, Dumas struggled to mix with her American classmates, who knew nothing about Iran. She also retells firsthand experiences of prejudice and racism from being Iranian in America during the Iranian Revolution. However, throughout hardships, she emphasizes the significance of family strength and love in her life. Career Since the publication of Funny in Farsi, her first book, she has been active on the lecture circuit, speaking at universities, conferences, high schools, middle schools, and other venues. Her other work has been published in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, Good Housekeeping, Gourmet and the San Francisco Chronicle. She has also been a commentator for National Public Radio, and a panelist on Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!. An attempt was made to adapt Funny in Farsi as a television sitcom by ABC in 2014. A pilot episode, directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and starring Maz Jobrani, was filmed but never aired. In July 31, 2014, she asked her readers who lived in Iran to purchase the English versions of her books, as the Persian versions not translated by Mohammed Soleimani Nia are unauthorized. Awards and honors As a result of Funny in Farsi's success, Firoozeh Dumas has been nominated for many awards, including the Thurber Prize for American Humor. Not only was she the first Iranian author to be nominated, she was also the first author from Asia to hold such an honor. She lost to Jon Stewart. She was also nominated for an Audie for best audio- book, losing to Bob Dylan. She was nominated for a PEN/USA Award in Creative Nonfiction. She received the Spirit of America Award in 2008 from the National Council for the Social Studies. Former recipients of this award include Jimmy Carter, Rosa Parks, and Mr. Rogers.

Early life and education Drawn to music at an early age, Sonni first learned piano, then trumpet, switching to guitar at 14. His love of the instrument led him to leave the University of Connecticut where he was studying literature to attend the Hartford Conservatory of Music. Career After graduating, Jack was introduced to New York session guitarist Elliott Randall (famous for his solo on the hit \\"Reelin' In the Years\\") by keyboardist Michael Holmes, a graduate of Eastman & bandmate of Tony Levin & Steve Gadd. Randall became a mentor & teacher and convinced Sonni to move to NYC and begin his career. Jack lived in NYC from 1976 thru 1985 initially trying to break into session work but began focusing on his own band. In the late 1970s, Sonni's band The Leisure Class had become a Monday night fixture at Kenny's Castaways on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, the place for up and coming acts. In the fall of 1977, Jack went to work at Alex Music on 48th Street in Manhattan. In 1978 he started working at the newly opened Rudy's Music Stop, owned by luthier Rudy Pensa, where he met members of Dire Straits, first David and then Mark Knopfler. He visited the Knopflers in London, and after David (and then Hal Lindes) left the band, Sonni was asked to join the band for the 1984 recording sessions for Brothers in Arms and the subsequent tour. Jack accepted,Flanagan, Bill (1985) Musician.

To meet the US Army's requirement, Piasecki's design featured two tandem, three-blade ducted rotors, with the crew of two seated between the two rotors. Power was by two Lycoming O-360-A2A piston engines, driving the rotors by a central gearbox. The first of two aircraft ordered by the Army, initially designated the Model 59K Skycar (and later renamed Airgeep) by Piasecki and designated VZ-8P by the Army, flew on 22 September 1958.Harding 1998, p.11.\\"PA-59K: History - Flying Jeeps \\".

After being loaned to the U.S. Navy for evaluation as the Model 59N where it was fitted with floats, it was returned to the Army and its engine replaced by a lighter and more powerful Garrett AiResearch TPE331-6 engine. The second prototype was completed to a modified design, designated Model 59H AirGeep II by Piasecki and VZ-8P (B) by the Army. It was powered by two Artouste engines, with ejection seats for the pilot and co-pilot/gunner and a further three seats for passengers.

It is a key enzyme in ketogenesis (ketone body formation). It is a ketogenic enzyme in the liver that catalyzes the formation of acetoacetate from HMG-CoA within the mitochondria. It also plays a prominent role in the catabolism of the amino acid leucine.  Structure  The HMGCL gene encodes a 34.5-kDa protein that is localized to the mitochondrion and peroxisome. Multible isoforms of the proteins are known due to alternative splicing. The major isoform (isoform 1) is most highly expressed in the liver whereas isoform 2 is found in energy- demanding tissues including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Structure of the HMGCL protein has been resolved by X-ray crystallography at 2.1-√Ö resolution, and reveals that the protein may function as a dimer. Substrate access to the active site of the HMGCL enzyme involves substrate binding across a cavity located at the C-terminal end of a beta barrel structure. In addition, the lysine 48 residue which is mutated in patients with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency is also found to be necessary for substrate binding.  Function  The HMGCL protein plays an essential role in breaking down dietary proteins and fats for energy. It catalyzes the reaction: (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA = acetyl-CoA + acetoacetate. and requires a divalent metal ion as co-factor. The enzyme is required for ketogenesis in the liver, and is also responsible for processing the amino acid leucine inside the mitochondrion Deficiency HMG-CoA lyase deficiency causes hypoketotic hypoglycemia similar to that is caused by HMGCS2 mutations but also leads to organic acid accumulation and metabolic acidosis due to altered leucine metabolism. This disorder can be mistaken for Reye syndrome because of the symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and convulsions. Ketogenesis Clinical significance Mutations in the HMGCL gene cause 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency (HMGCLD), a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by disruption of ketogenesis and L-leucine catabolism. To-date more than 30 different mutations including missense mutations of different residues have been associated with patients with HMGCLD in diverse families and ethnicities. HMGCLD typically presents in the first year of the patient's life after a fasting period. Clinical acute symptoms include vomiting, seizures, metabolic acidosis, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and lethargy.  Interactions  HMGCL interacts with itself to form homodimers and homotetramers. It is also shown in yeast two-hybrid experiments to interact with DNAJA1.

State ‚Äì 80% Special education In December 2009, the district administration reported that 149 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received special education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. California Area School District received a $608,708 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010‚Äì11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 19 or 2.03% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy and school safety The California Area School District administration reported there were no incidents of bullying, in the district, in 2009‚Äì2010. The California Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget In 2009, the district reports employing over 80 teachers with a starting salary of $35,475 for 180 days for pupil instruction and 186 days total. The average teacher salary was $52,148 while the maximum salary is $111,885. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.Teachers need to know enough is enough, PaDelcoTimes, April 20, 2010. Additionally, California Area School District teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 11 sick days, 4 paid bereavement days, 3 personal days and many other benefits. Teachers work 7 hours and 15 minutes. Teachers are guaranteed daily prep periods. Teachers are paid extra if they are required to work outside of the regular school day Teachers receive a severance bonus the amount of which depends on length of service. According to State Rep. Glen Grell, a trustee of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees‚Äô Retirement System Board, a 40-year educator can retire with a pension equal to 100 percent of their final salary. In 2007, the district employed 66 teachers and the average teacher salary in the district was $44,790 for 180 days worked. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation. The district administrative costs were $1,012.30 per pupil in 2008. This ranked 58th among Pennsylvania school districts for administrative spending. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. In 2008, California Area School District reported spending $13,676 per pupil. This ranked 124th in the commonwealth. ; Reserves In 2009, the district reported $1,473,485 in an unreserved-undesignated fund balance. The designated fund balance was reported as $1,248,983. In January 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. Findings were reported to the administration and school board. The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government.California Area School District Budget 2009‚Äì10, California Area School Board, 2010 Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the income level. =State basic education funding= In 2011‚Äì12, the district will receive $5,607,648 in state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the district will receive $69,287 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget includes $5,354,629,000 for the 2011‚Äì2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010‚Äì2011.

Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004‚Äì2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math teacher coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010‚Äì11 the district applied for and received $188,062 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The California Area School District uses the funding to provide extensive teacher training, reduced class size in K-3rd, to improve instruction based on research and other uses. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. California Area School District was denied funding in 2006‚Äì07. In 2007‚Äì08 the district received $108,865. In 2008‚Äì09, the district received 45,413 for a total funding of $154,278. All but 50 school district participated in the program. Education Assistance grant The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010‚Äì11, California Area School District applied for and received $21,696 in funding. =Federal Stimulus funding= The district received an extra $1,454,096 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was for the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11 school years. Race to the Top grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district hundreds of thousands of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Common Cents state initiative= The California Area School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= California Area School District School Board set property tax rates in 2011 at 91.0700 mills. School year 2010‚Äì11 was the 12th year in a row that the California Area School Board had not raised taxes. Board member George Safin credited a generous state subsidy funding. The district also receives 10 mills payment in lieu of taxes paid by California University of Pennsylvania for dormitory property in the district. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010 ‚Äì 91.0700 mills. *2009 ‚Äì 91.0700 mills. *2008 ‚Äì 91.0700 mills. *2007 ‚Äì 91.0700 mills. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index and the adjusted index for each district are publicly announced by the Pennsylvania Department of Education in September each year. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. The School District Adjusted Index for the California Area School District 2006‚Äì2007 through 2010‚Äì2011. *2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 5.6%, Base 3.9% *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 4.9%, Base 3.4% *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 6.3%, Base 4.4% *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 5.8%, Base 4.1% *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 4.1%, Base 2.9% *2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì 2.0%, Base 1.4% *2012‚Äì13 ‚Äì 2.4%, Base 1.7% For the 2011‚Äì12 school year the California Area School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the school board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The California Area School Board also did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index for the budget year 2010‚Äì2011, nor for 2009‚Äì10. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2010, property tax relief for 2,428 approved residents of California Area School District was set at $179 for 2,271 approved homesteads. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the California Area School District was $179 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 1,311 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Washington County, the highest tax relief went to Washington School District at $407 in 2009 and $414 in 2010. The greatest tax relief in Pennsylvania went to the Chester Upland School District of Delaware County set at $632 in 2009 and $641 in 2010.Tax Relief per Homestead May 1, 2010, Pennsylvania Department of Education Report 2010. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Washington County, 73% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. =Enrollment and Consolidation= The enrollment at California Area School District is among the lowest 8% in Pennsylvania. Department of Education enrollment projections do not anticipate a growth in enrollment for the next decade. A Standard and Poors study found that an optimal school district size, to conserve administrative costs, was 3000 pupils. Consolidation of administrations with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial administrative cost savings for people in both communities.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, Standard and Poor's School Evaluation Services, 2007. According to a 2009 proposal by Governor Edward Rendell, the excessive administrative overhead dollars could be redirected to improving high school student academic achievement, enriching the curriculum programs or to reducing local property taxes. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). Pennsylvania Department of Education data shows that from 1999 to 2000 to 2008‚Äì09 there has been a 12 percent increase in public school staff even as there was a 1 percent decline in enrollment. Pennsylvania schools added 17,345 professional employees and 15,582 support workers over this time, while enrollment declined by 26,960.Pennsylvania Department of Education Enrollment data and Public School Staffing data. Total public school enrollment in 2009 was 1,787,351 pupils. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants released a report finding that the state would save hundreds of million by cutting the number of school administrations in half through consolidation, with no impact on programs offered to students. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009‚Äì10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania districts. New York: Standard & Poor‚Äôs School Evaluation Services. 2007, p. 6. Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. California competes in single A WPIAL sports which include baseball, basketball, football, soccer, tennis and volleyball. The school board sets policies regarding eligibility to participate in these activities. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.Home- Schooled, Charter School Children Can Participate in School District Extracurricular Activities, Pennsylvania Office of the Governor Press Release, November 10, 2005 As a part of constraints imposed by the 2011‚Äì2012 budget, the board eliminated nine assistant coaching positions and afterschool weightlifting and fitness programs. The high school boys' tennis program was eliminated because only one student was on the team. The program costs about $7,000 a year.

In the \\"Jun Shi\\" (ÂêõÂ•≠) chapter of the Classic of History, the Duke of Zhou names him as one of the five key advisers of King Wen, together with Guo Shu, Hong Yao, Tai Dian, and San Yisheng. After King Wen's death, Nangong Kuo became a key adviser of his son King Wu. Bronze inscriptions Nangong Kuo was the founder of a major aristocratic lineage of the Western Zhou. His eldest son probably died early, and his second son Nangong Mao (ÂçóÂÆ´ÊØõ) inherited his title. The famous Da Yu ding, now a national treasure of China, was cast by Nangong Kuo's grandson Yu (ÁõÇ), and dedicated to him. The bronze inscription on the vessel traces Yu's lineage back to Nangong (, Duke of Nan), who is identified by scholars, including Li Xueqin and Li Feng, with Nangong Kuo. Inscriptions on other unearthed bronze vessels indicate that during the late Western Zhou period, the Nangong lineage continued to produce important military leaders like Nangong Liu, and civil administrators such as Nangong Hu, Supervisor of Land. Inscriptions on excavated bronzes from the tombs of the marquises of Zeng in Hubei Province indicate that Kang (Áä∫) of the Nangong clan was enfeoffed with the Zeng state by either King Cheng or King Kang of Zhou. Kang, the first Marquis of Zeng, was either Nangong Kuo's son or great-grandson (Yu's son). In fiction Nangong Kuo is a character in the Ming dynasty classic novel Fengshen Yanyi. In this novel, Nangong Kuo is a renowned general that had loyally served under Ji Chang (King Wen of Zhou) of Mount Singing Phoenix. Nangong generally seems to be more of an aggressive individual, and will rush to rather impulsive conclusions at times. Following the death of Ji Chang's first son, Bo Yikao, Nangong would swear eternal revenge against King Zhou. Due to Nangong's continuous lust to attack Zhaoge at any possible moment, San Yisheng develops a negative liking towards him.Fengshen Yanyi chapter 28 Following King Wen's attack upon Tiger Town, the capital of Chong Houhu, Nangong is the first to charge the gates of the capital. When General Huang Yuanji stands before him, Nangong yells, \\"Huang Yuanji, you small potato, get out of my way! I only want to fight the real Chong Houhu himself!\\" With these words, Nangong, with his great knife, cuts Huang Yuanji down with relative ease. Later on following General Zhang Guifang's attack upon Phoenix City during the Huang Feihu retrieval arc, Nangong duels it out against Vanguard Feng Lin. After defeating Feng with great ease, he is captured by Feng's magic technique; only later due to Nezha's assistance would he be saved.

A well balanced player, who is able to play both on the right wing and in the centre, he is mainly known for his speed and passing ability. Club career =Talleres de C√≥rdoba= Ledesma was born in La Falda, C√≥rdoba. During the summer of 2001, he officially transferred to Talleres de C√≥rdoba and began in the youth team. In his lone season with the C√≥rdoba based club, Ledesma did manage 2 first team appearances. After several impressive performances, the former River Plate player, was scouted by Boca Juniors, but before moving to Boca's youth divisions he played for F√∫tbol Juvenil FC. =Boca Juniors= In the summer of 2003, Ledesma officially transferred to Boca Juniors at the age of 19. His debut for Boca was on July 12, 2003 when Boca lost 2‚Äì1 to Col√≥n de Santa Fe. In the Copa Libertadores 2007 Ledesma was a driving force down the right side of midfield for the eventual Champions. Ledesma also scored a clever close- range flick against Colombia's C√∫cuta in the Semi Final 1st leg and a brave header at the end of the 1st Leg of the Final against Gremio. After 5 impressive seasons with the Argentine giants, that included well over 100 appearances and 15 total goal, he was monitored by several European clubs, and soon transferred to the Italian Serie A, with Sicilian giants Calcio Catania. =Calcio Catania= He was officially signed by Catania during the 2008/2009 summer transfer window. He was one of 12 players signed by the Sicilian club during that window, listing Catania as one of the league's most active clubs in the transfer market, along with Sicilian rivals U.S. Citt√† di Palermo. In his first season with the club, Ledesma was regularly a part of the club's first team under, then coach, Walter Zenga, making 24 league appearances, scoring 2 goals in the process. In his second season with the club, the 26-year-old Ledesma, was hampered by injuries, and found playing time harder to come by under Sini≈°a Mihajloviƒá, as he was not fully fit for the majority of the season. Ledesma made just 16 appearances in the duration of the 2009‚Äì10 Serie A season, but helped to guide Catania to a 13th place league finish, also reaching a record points total for the club. He has since re-established himself back into Catania's starting line-up and made 30 appearances during the 2010-11 campaign, bringing his total appearances for the club up to 74, helping the club to a 13th-place finish in the league and a record points total in Serie A for a third consecutive season. =Boca Juniors= In the winter in Europe of 2012, Pablo Ledesma abandoned Calcio Catania to return to Argentina after three years and played in Boca Juniors. By Twitter one of his partner insult him when he left Calcio Catania, and saying that the club was very supportive when he left Boca Juniors. Back in Argentina he played for the first time in a friendly match with River Plate on the Derby of Argentina. Boca won 2‚Äì0 with two goals from Nicolas Blandi, while Ledesma also played a great match.

It was built from to . The homestead and associated buildings once belonged to pastoral run on the Fitzroy River, seven kilometres northwest of Rockhampton, Queensland. Originally much larger at 127 square miles the current size of the property is . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The grazing property was originally settled in 1858 by leaseholder John Arthur McCartney. In 1860, Macartney opposed a proposal to establish a municipality for Rockhampton with a proposed area of about 225 square kilometres. Glenmore, on the northern side of the river, was as vulnerable as Gracemere Station (the proposed boundaries of the municipality included the head station and Gracemere Homestead). Glenmore, however, did not have the substantial homestead and outbuildings like Gracemere. Eventually, the boundaries for the Municipality of Rockhampton were established as the usual five square miles. In 1861 the Birkbeck family arrived in Rockhampton from Mexico to inspect grazing land after Samuel Bradford Birkbeck had spent half his lifetime as a mining engineer and manager of a silver mine. Birkbeck had worked on his father's farm in Illinois, USA, during his youth, but had no experience of Australian pastoral life. On 14 January 1864, the land was purchased by Birkbeck and his Spanish-Mexican wife, Damiana de Barre Valdez. The Birkbecks had eight sons and one daughter, Elena. In July 1865, residents expressed anxieties about the presence of natives in the vicinity and a group of Native Police attacked members of the Darumbal tribe and massacred up to 18 of them, and then burnt their corpses. Sheep were raised on the property but due to a poor climate for that purpose the Birbecks turned to cattle. They imported 1,500 from Texas. He died in 1867. The property has remained in the family and up until the 1980s, members of the family resided in the limestone brick cottage and the slab building. At the time of the arrival of the Birkbeck family, Glenmore Homestead consisted of a four-roomed slab house and two log cabins which were included as part of the station's improvements. It is believed that Macartney constructed the log cabin in 1859 and is reputed to be the oldest building north of the Fitzroy River. In the last fifty years it has been used for storage. It is not clear what became of the four-roomed slab house and second log cabin. No longer extant, it is possible that these may have been removed as new buildings were constructed. The buildings proved inadequate for the needs of the Birkbeck family. Birkbeck bought a large slab building and re-erected it on his property. Constructed , the slab house was originally used as a hotel at Parkhurst and was moved to Glenmore in 1861. The slab homestead (known also as the Bush Inn) was built as an inn on the northern road to the Canoona goldfield. The limestone brick cottage was constructed by Dennis Cifuentes in 1862. Cifuentes came out from Mexico with the support of the Birkbeck family. The building was to be the beginning of a large, hacienda-style homestead, however, this was never completed. Later, Cifuentes took up a block in partnership with Carlos Birkbeck and, in 1874, took up on the Cawarral Run. In a desire to achieve closer settlement, the Queensland Government undertook a program of resuming all or parts of larger estates and then offering the land as a number of smaller lots to selectors. As early as 1862, the Birkbecks were aware of surveys of agricultural land taking place on the town side of their run. Samuel Birkbeck died in 1867 and his sons, Robert, Alfred and Carlos, were left to manage the property. The Birkbecks were the first in the Central District to be directly affected by the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1868. On 1 January 1869, over seven thousand hectares of the Glenmore run (over half of the Glenmore estate) was resumed and opened to selection. Although the Birbecks were offered a pre-emptive selection, in order to keep hold of some of their former land, the Birkbecks each selected blocks on the resumed half. The blacksmith's shop constructed on the property by , with the sheds being constructed by 1920. Other buildings have been constructed more recently, including a kitchen and dance hall and the owners residence. The \\"Walter and Eliza Hall Cottage\\" was moved to the site in 1985. In 1913, Eliza Hall donated towards the provision of small homes for aged couples. It appears that the cottage was one of four constructed within the grounds of the Benevolent Society. Until the 1980s, the Birkbeck family lived in the original homestead. In the early 1980s, the house was opened to the public as a heritage tourism and functions centre, owned and operated by George Louis Birkbeck. A souvenir shop was built in 1985. Other late-19th century and early 20th century farm buildings are also on site. The balance of the land that remains as a portion of the original property is owned by Arthur James Birkbeck (eldest son of Tolstoy Carlos Birkbeck) and managed by Mark Jason Birkbeck, his second son.  Description  The buildings at Glenmore Homestead are interesting, as they show several types of early dwelling in the Central Queensland area. They consist of a log cabin which was built in 1859 by McCartney, a slab cottage which built in 1858 as a hotel in nearby Parkhurst and moved to the site by Samuel Birkbeck in 1861 as well as a brick cottage which was built by a Mexican employee of the Birkbeck family in 1862. This was originally to be part of a larger hacienda-style homestead, which was never completed. The slab homestead was built on a short- lived gold field called Canoona. The property is located on the east bank of the Fitzroy River, seven kilometres northwest of Rockhampton. The place is a homestead complex comprising successive residences of varying construction methods, including log cabin construction; a slab building and a limestone brick cottage with adobe gables. The buildings included in the heritage register boundary include the log cabin (-59); the slab homestead ( and moved to Glenmore in 1861); the rendered limestone brick cottage (1862); a timber blacksmith's shop () and timber framed sheds (). Other buildings located on the property include a souvenir shop constructed in 1985; a kitchen and dance hall constructed 1984; the owner's residence and shed and the former \\"Walter and Eliza Hall Cottage\\", relocated to the site in 1985. These buildings are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. = Log cabin = The log cabin is a one room hut built of horizontal logs checked into each other at the corners and lined with bark. Corrugated iron has been placed over shingled roof. The log cabin is currently used for storage of agricultural and other items associated with Glenmore. = Homestead building = Placed upon a stone foundation when moved to the site in 1861, the vertical slab building is an eight room structure, approximately twelve and a half metres long by five and a half metres wide, with a verandah on the western and eastern sides. French doors open along the entire length of the eastern verandah. The roof is clad with corrugated iron. A two-roomed, timber extension, originally housing a kitchen, is located to the south-western end of the slab building. Internally, the main room is presented as the dining room. Rooms located at either of the main dining room opening onto the verandah as well as to the rear, or south-west section, of the building. The homestead building is no longer used by the Birkbeck family. Visitors to Glenmore can are able to view the inside of the building from the verandah. = Limestone brick cottage = A T-shaped building, the four-roomed, limestone brick cottage has lime-based, rendered walls with adobe gables, with a verandah on the south-western side. The roof is clad with the original gospel oak iron. The external walls are approximately thick and the interior walls approximately thick. Ceilings are of milled timber. The largest room in the house is furnished as a sitting room. The sitting room contains many items which were brought from Mexico, including Damiana Birkbeck's silver crucifix, made in Italy, which sits on a small table with rosary beads in a box made of silky oak; two matching occasional tables; family portraits and musical instruments, including a guitar and mandolin. Two rooms have been set up with display cases. The fourth room is currently used for storage. A toilet, constructed from stone quarried on the property, is located to the north-west of the cottage. A lavatory, comprising a timber beam supported by two timber uprights, with a concave tin plate on the ground, stands nearby. The timber framed shed which was constructed to house the lavatory, is no longer extant.  Heritage listing  Glenmore Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Glenmore Homestead is important in demonstrating the development of the Rockhampton District, illustrating the pattern of early European exploration and settlement of Queensland. Taken up by the Birkbeck family in 1864, the complex is further significant as it is still in the ownership of the same family. Glenmore Homestead is significant as a complex that provides a record of an evolving pastoral property comprising successive residences of varying construction methods, including a hut of horizontal log construction with extant shingle roof; slab-built homestead and a rendered limestone brick cottage, as well as associated outbuildings and structures, including a limestone toilet and water tank. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The homestead is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early Queensland homesteads, constructed as the head station of a large run. The various additions, dating from the 1860s, demonstrate the growth of the Birkbeck family. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Surrounded by mature vegetation including Ficus sp. and Burdekin plum trees, the complex has aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Glenmore Homestead has a special association with the life and work of several generations of the Birkbeck family who contributed to the development of the surrounding area.

The cans can be laid in concrete, stacked vertically on top of each other, and crushed or cut and flattened to be used as shingles. They can also be used for furniture. Tin cans can form the actual fill-in structure (or walls) of a building, as is done with earthships. Tin cans have not been around for a long time, and neither have their building methods. The two main structural methods for building with tin cans are by laying them horizontally in a concrete matrix and by stacking them vertically.  History  Tin can building in New Mexico originated in the early 1980s as a response to the massive amounts of trash being discarded and the wasteful nature of common building practices. Tin can construction was an attempt to utilize a readily available resource that was normally sent to landfills or recycling centers. This led to various experiments in tin can building, including space-filler between wooden frames in traditional house styles and creating domes and archways using cans and cement. Within time, more simplified and practical methods were developed, such as the earthship tin can wall. The main person behind these efforts was Mike Reynolds, also creator of the earthship building method.  Construction  A ‚Äútraditional‚Äù earthship tin can wall is made by horizontally stacking tin cans in a concrete matrix. The cans are laid side by side and in alternating rows, similar to bricks. This is done simply and efficiently, using batches of concrete between the cans. The consistency of the concrete must be relatively thick, so as to hold its form and the tin cans in place. A surprisingly large number of cans are required. The method for stacking the cans involves creating a row of cans separated by hand-formed ‚Äúlumps‚Äù of concrete. The layout of a row is can, concrete, can, etc. This is then repeated, except that the alternating pattern is reversed, so that every can is laid on top of a concrete ‚Äúlump‚Äù below it. This continues until completed, or the weight of the wall and the hardness of the cement seem questionable in terms of solidity. At that point it would be wise to wait for the wall to harden, but the laying time for cans and concrete is such that by the time a builder makes it back to an area that was recently laid it has had time to set. It is a judgment call as to whether or not the builder should continue, but by the next day or even later in the same day building can resume. Materials The materials that go into a tin can wall are simple: mainly tin cans and concrete. Tin cans (now aluminum cans as real tin cans are not as readily available) can be acquired from any recycling center or a local bar. Brick mortar may also be used instead of cement.  Coating  Once the wall is completed, the cans and the concrete are covered with a layer of cement or adobe mud mixture. What is applied depends on the location of the wall; if it is located in an area where it will be exposed to water (such as in a bathroom or utility room) it will need to be coated with a concrete layer. If it is located in a living room or bedroom, it can be covered with adobe plaster. A tin can wall that has half of its structure outside (such as the wall of an entrance to a building) will be coated with cement on the outside and adobe on the inside. The shape of the cans (their pull-tabs, etc.) and the roughness of the cement will provide a lath-like surface for the cement or adobe to stick to. This initial layer is ‚Äúscreeted‚Äù (scratched with a tool that creates a ridge-like pattern thereby making it easier to apply another coat) and a second layer is added. More layers may be added, but it is up to the builder‚Äôs judgment and dependent upon the material being applied. In the case of adobe mud, once the initial layer is applied and allowed to harden it will crack and will need additional coats. With cement fewer layers are needed. The basic rule is: the more coats/layers, the stronger and better-looking the wall will be. This can be overdone however. When a tin can wall has been sufficiently coated it will then be ‚Äúfinished‚Äù with a fine plaster (lime-based or other), stucco (if the wall is outside), or linseed oil (in the case of adobe). It can also be finished with a clay ‚Äúslip‚Äù, or aliz, which is an earth-based coat that can have natural pigment and fine grains of mica mixed in to produce a beautiful shimmering and organic-looking surface.  Examples  An outside tin can insulating wall is a simple design. It is made out of two tin can walls with a layer of solid insulation in the middle. The insulation can vary in thickness, depending on climate and budget. It can be made out of various ‚Äúgreen‚Äù or sustainable materials or average run-of-the-mill solid insulation. The exposed sides of the tin can walls (those not facing the insulation) are finished using methods aforementioned. The inside part of the wall can be coated with adobe while the outside is finished with concrete and stucco. A door frame can be built into the can wall, or rather the can wall is built around the frame. The process involves initially having a door frame set in place (on the foundation) and stacking cans to either side of the frame until they reach the other walls of the building and the ceiling. The door frame is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially into the side of the frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the nails. Short strips of metal lath are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix. The same method is applied to windows. The only difference is all sides of window are fastened to the tin can wall, while the door frame is fastened to the foundation on one side (bottom) and the can wall on three sides. Metal lath and nails are all that is needed, along with a bubble level or similar device. Once the desired height is reached to install a window frame, the wall is leveled. If any cans stick above the level plane they can be flattened to the desired height. Nails and lath sticking out from under the window frame holds the bottom of it in place, and the sides and top of the frame are fastened in the same fashion as a door frame. To make a smooth transition from door (or window frame) to tin can wall with plaster, sheets of metal lath are attached to the rim of the frame and folded over the gap between the frame and the can wall. A double-layered wooden frame is therefore required, to give a surface for the metal lath to be nailed to while leaving the inside frame untouched. However, this is not necessarily a necessity. Electrical wiring is simple, with the wires attached to the cans or fastened to the concrete before the initial coat. If a wire needs to go to the other side of a wall it can be punched directly through a can. Plumbing and pipework can use similar methods. The can wall can always be built around a pipe, or there can be a wooden frame made similar to a window or door to house the pipe.  Strength and use  Tin can walls are not considered load-bearing using this building method, although two-story circular dome structures have been built. The basic rule is that it can support considerable weight but should not be used to hold up much more than its own form and shape. It would not be wise to attach a heavy timber roof to a tin can wall without support beams or frames. The basic function for can walls is in-fill (filling in the space between support beams or the main structure) and the division of space. They work well to separate a living room from a bedroom, and are also used as insulating walls from the outside. An earthship tin can wall is both an efficient and economical building method. They are mainly composed of aluminum and cement, and can withstand the test of time. They are made from few materials (the coating method can be more complex than building the wall itself). They use recycled materials and require little or no skill to build.  Alternative methods  The other tin can wall method that will be briefly described is a system developed by a German artist named Michael H√∂nes. He has led community rebuilding efforts in Lesotho, Africa using tin cans to create housing and opportunities for Aids orphans and foster mothers. Known as the TCV (a.k.a. Tin-Can Villages) project, H√∂nes has created buildings using tin cans, masonite, paint, and wire. The roof is made out of corrugated metal shingles. In this method the cans are stacked vertically, one on top of the other in rows that are placed side by side and secured with wire. They are left exposed and are arranged in a decorative manner. The structures require no foundation, and are said to be able to withstand the Lesotho storms. A site for the first village in Maseru has been secured and the funding has been sourced. What is lacking is building permits (as of July 2004). The TCV organization, headed by H√∂nes, has been prefabricating tin can walls so that when the permits pass about one building a week can be constructed. So far the TCV organization‚Äôs efforts have been concentrated on storehouses, offices, a large weaving workshop for the women of the Elelloang Basali Weavers group in Teyateyaneng, and a solar-powered restaurant that cooks with solar ovens. Michael H√∂nes also focuses on tin can furniture and has created a stove out of tin cans that uses one-third less wood than what the poor people of the area commonly use, thereby diminishing the firewood crisis in Lesotho.

He emphasised the importance of considering the possibility of multiple separate diseases in a patient whenever his or her history and the results of the physical examination were atypical of any single condition. Traditionally, there is thought to be no pathophysiological basis for the coexistence of these three diseases. Saint emphasized that more than one disease may be responsible for a patient's clinical signs and symptoms, and his triad provides a counterexample to the commonly used diagnostic principle that \\"the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible,\\" also known as Occam's Razor. The principle underlying Saint's triad is also expressed as Hickam's dictum. =Recent evidence= A twist to this philosophic discussion on the art of diagnosis is that, in recent times, the possibility of an underlying pathophysiology has been considered--obesity is associated with gallstones, hiatal hernia, and diverticular disease, and there is the suggestion of an underlying connective tissue defect such as a \\"herniosis.\\"\\"Is herniosis the single etiology of Saint‚Äôs triad?\\" M.

The village is serviced and is within the North Pocono School District. The former Lackawanna Railroad station houses a railroad museum and is served by excursion trains from Steamtown National Historic Site in nearby Scranton. The area is extremely scenic and popular with hunters and naturalists. Much of Wayne County's water is under special protection. Education The majority of Gouldsboro is in Lehigh Township, and is therefore served primarily by the North Pocono School District, in which it is part of Region III. The small part of the CDP which is contained within Coolbaugh Township, however, is in the Pocono Mountain School District, in which it is also part of Region III. Postal Service In addition to parts of the aforementioned Lehigh and Coolbaugh Townships, parts of Clifton, Thornhurst, and Covington Townships in Lackawanna County are serviced by the Gouldsboro Post Office, and are also often referred to as \\"Gouldsboro\\".

This tide usually adds only a couple of inches to normal spring tides. Astronomical causes The Moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, which causes the Moon to be closer to Earth and farther away at different times. The Moon and the Sun are aligned every two weeks, which results in spring tides, which are 20% higher than normal. During the period of the new moon, the Moon and Sun are on the same side of Earth, so the high tides or bulges produced independently by each reinforce each other (and has nothing to do with the spring season). Tides of maximum height and depression produced during this period are known as spring tide. Spring tides that coincide with the moon's closest approach to Earth (\\"perigee\\") have been called perigean spring tides and generally increase the normal tidal range by a couple of inches. The Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962 which inundated the entire Atlantic coastline of the United States from the Carolinas to Cape Cod, resulting in a loss of 40 lives and over 500 million dollars of property damage, coincided with a perigean spring tide.

Enrofloxacin is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of individual pets and domestic animals in the United States. In September 2005, the FDA withdrew approval of Baytril for use in water to treat flocks of poultry, as this practice was noted to promote the evolution of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of the bacterium Campylobacter, a human pathogen. It is a bactericidal agent. The bactericidal activity of enrofloxacin is concentration-dependent, with susceptible bacteria cell death occurring within 20‚Äì30 minutes of exposure. Enrofloxacin has demonstrated a significant post-antibiotic effect for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and is active in both stationary and growth phases of bacterial replication. Enrofloxacin is partially deethylated by CYP450 into the active metabolite ciprofloxacin, which is also a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Activity and susceptibility data Enrofloxacin is a synthetic antibacterial agent from the class of the fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivatives. It has antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram- positive bacteria. It is effective against: * Pseudomonas aeruginosa * Klebsiella * Escherichia coli * Enterobacter * Campylobacter * Shigella * Salmonella * Aeromonas * Haemophilus * Proteus * Yersinia * Serratia * Vibrio * Brucella * Chlamydia trachomatis * Staphylococcus (including penicillinase- producing and methicillin-resistant strains) * Mycoplasma * Mycobacterium Variable activity against: * Streptococcus Ineffective against: * Anaerobes The following data represent minimum inhibitory concentration ranges for a few medically significant bacterial pathogens: * Escherichia coli - 0.022 - 0.03 ¬µg/ml * Staphylococcus aureus - 0.0925 - 64 ¬µg/ml * Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 0.05 ¬µg/ml Contraindications/precautions Usage in poultry. Adverse effects/warnings Enrofloxacin was banned for poultry use in 2005. Overdosage/acute toxicity It is unlikely that an acute overdose of either compound would result in symptoms more serious than either anorexia or vomiting, but the adverse effects noted above could occur. Dogs receiving 10 times the labeled dosage rate of enrofloxacin for at least 14 days developed only vomiting and anorexia. Death did occur in some dogs when fed 25 times the labeled rate for 11 days, however. * Oral : greater than 5000 mg/kg * Dermal LD50: greater than 2000 mg/kg * Inhalation LD50: greater than 3547 mg/m3 (4-hour exposure) * Eye effects: irritant; reversible in less than 7 days. In cats, it can produce sudden onset blindness when administered by injection, as it is retinotoxic. Degradation The brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum striatum can degrade the fluoroquinolone enrofloxacin using hydroxyl radicals.

They were renamed Sportverein Budissa 04 in 1907 and went on to claim several local championships in the Gau Oberlausitz in the 1910s and again in the early 1930s. This led to repeated appearances in the regional championship round where they were usually eliminated in early rounds.Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag By the time World War II broke out in 1939, SVB was playing third-tier ball on the local circuit. After the war, the Allied authorities banned existing organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs. Budissa was re-established in 1946 as Sparte S√ºd, but was soon playing as Sportgemeinde Bautzen-S√ºd. In 1949, that club merged with SG Bautzen-West (successor of Bautzner SC) to form BSG Einheit Bautzen. The following year the club was renamed BSG Motor Bautzen. The team soon earned a Bezirksliga (III) title that advanced them to East Germany's second division DDR-Liga in 1954. League restructuring the next season saw Bautzen in the third division 2. DDR- Liga where they would compete until winning their way back to the DDR-Liga (II) in 1958. After a couple of close brushes with relegation the club was sent back down after the 1960 campaign, but immediately re-claimed a place in second-tier play, remaining there until the 1967‚Äì68 season. Except for a brief return to the DDR-Liga in 1974‚Äì1976, Motor spent the next two dozen seasons bouncing between third and fourth division play. Throughout this period, the club was regularly participating in the opening rounds of the FDGB-Pokal (East German Cup), but did not enjoy any success in playing there. After German re- unification in 1990 the club reclaimed its heritage and reestablished itself as Fu√üballspielvereinigung Budissa Bautzen. They made a brief two-season appearance in the Landesliga Sachsen (V) in 1992‚Äì94. FSV was promoted to the Landesliga a second time in 2002 and this time captured the 2005 championship to advance to the NOFV-Oberliga S√ºd. The club played at this level for nine seasons, coming close to promotion in 2010 and 2013 when it finished runners- up.

Early life Russell was born at West Maitland, New South Wales, the fourth son of the Hon. Bourn Russell and his wife Jane, n√©e Mackreth. Russell was educated at West Maitland Grammar school and the University of Sydney, (BA, 1859). Sydney Observatory Russell joined the staff of the Sydney Observatory under William Scott who resigned in 1862. Russell then became acting director until 1864 until the new government astronomer, George Smalley, was appointed. On the death of Smalley on 11 July 1870 Harley Wood, 'Smalley, George Robarts (1822‚Äì1870)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 6, MUP, 1976, pp 136‚Äì137. Russell became government astronomer a salary of ¬£555 and held the position for 35 years. Russell immediately began reorganising and refurnishing the building, which he succeeded in getting considerably enlarged during the next seven years. With Robert L. J. Ellery, Russell organised an expedition to observe a total eclipse of the sun to Cape Sidmouth in 1871. Russell prepared for the observation of the transit of Venus in 1874 for which four observing stations were equipped. Russell arranged for a band of competent observers to staff them, and the results were generally very successful; an interesting account of them was published by Russell in 1892, Observations of the Transit of Venus. Meteorology career Russell began to develop the meteorological side of his work, in 1877 he published a substantial volume, Climate of New South Wales: Descriptive, Historical and Tabular. In this volume some attention is given to the question of weather periodicity, on which he had written a paper in 1876. In later years he gave a great deal of attention to it. At the beginning of Russell's appointment there were only 12 observing stations in New South Wales, but before he resigned there were about 1800. There was little money for equipment, but Russell made use of available materials and designed a rain gauge which could be made at a cost of one-sixth of the imported gauges. Russell also invented various self-recording barometers, thermometers, anemometers and rain gauges. This reduced and made possible the work of his observers, almost all of whom gave their services voluntarily. In collaboration with Sir Charles Todd of South Australia, and Robert L. J. Ellery and Pietro Baracchi of Victoria, weather reporting in Australia was co- ordinated until the daily weather forecasts showed a very high percentage of accuracy. The long series of Meteorological Observations made at the Government Observatory, Sydney, published under Russell's direction contain an enormous mass of information relating to the climate of New South Wales. Russell was interested in the study of double stars and published in 1882 Results of Double Star Measures made at the Sydney Observatory 1871 to 1881. He also gave a great deal of attention to the application of photography to astronomical work. In 1887 he attended the astrographic congress at Paris and arranged for the co-operation of the Sydney observatory. This involved the taking and measurement of 1400 photographic plates. Russell supervised the preparation of the portion of the Astrographic Catalogue undertaken by the Sydney observatory until his retirement. In 1888 he was elected president of the newly formed Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1891 became vice-chancellor of the university of Sydney, but resigned within a year on account of the pressure of his other duties. By 1893 Russell had discovered 500 new double stars. In 1903 Russell had a severe illness from which he never completely recovered. He had a year's leave of absence and resigned the position of government astronomer in 1905. Russell died at the observatory on 22 February 1907. Russell was for some years president of the Royal Society of New South Wales, was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1886, and was created C.M.G. in 1890. Russell contributed papers to various societies, many of which appeared in the Memoirs and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Others papers will be found in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, and other journals. He also took an important part in the initiation of technical education in New South Wales. Family Russell married Emily Jane, daughter of Ambrose Foss, who survived him with a son and four daughters.Una Stella Haslingden Russell (b. 1871 at Goulbourn), the wife of, John William Downer and then, D'Arcy Wentworth Addisons Henry Edward Russell is not related notwithstanding the report in the article 'Interesting Weddings' (. Her parents being Henry Edward Russell and Frances Emily Russell nee Robey () Legacy Russell was a conscientious and enthusiastic worker; his hours of attendance at the observatory were commonly from nine in the morning until midnight. He was an excellent mechanic and was responsible for many inventions which proved to be of great value in relation with his work. His theory of a 19 years cycle in weather periodicity could not be proved on the information available, and the same may be said of the 33 years cycle of Charles Egeson, an assistant of Russell's at the observatory. Russell's paper on the Darling River read in 1879, suggesting that vast supplies of water must be flowing at a lower level was a very interesting prediction considering that artesian water was practically unknown at the time. But, however interesting these theories may have been, the great value of Russell's efforts lies in the mass of tabulated work done by him or under his direction in astronomy and especially meteorology, which has been a mine of information for all workers in the subjects.

She was played by Denise Alexander from 1973 through February 28, 1984 on contract and from 1996 to 2009 in a recurring status. Alexander returned to the series briefly in 2013, to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Alexander made subsequent appearances in 2017 and 2019. Casting Actress Denise Alexander originated the role of Dr. Lesley Williams in March 1973. In 1976, although TIME magazine panned General Hospital at the time, Alexander's character Lesley was noted as the serial's saving grace. When Alexander and the network could not agree to contractual negotiations, the character was killed off in March 1984. Angry fans picketed the studio, upset that the character had died. In 1996, the series wrote the character back on, and Alexander appeared in a recurring status until October 2009. Alexander returned to the role, once again in a recurring status, from May 16, 2013, to December 13, 2013. In November 2017, it was announced that Alexander would reprise her role, she returned for a one-off visit on December 22, 2017. In March 2019, Entertainment Weekly announced that Alexander would again return as Lesley, in celebration of the serial's 56th anniversary; she made her appearance during the April 2, 2019, episode. Storylines =1973‚Äì84= Lesley came to Port Charles in March 1973 and immediately joined the staff at General Hospital. Florence Gray became one of Lesley's first patients. Florence was suffering from stomach ulcers, which she thought were caused by her troubled marriage with Gordon Gray. She started seeing psychiatrist Peter Taylor. Florence told Peter about her husband's affair with one of her students years earlier. He had gotten her pregnant but the child died at birth. Peter told Lesley about Florence's history and is shocked to find out that she was that very student who had the affair with Gordon. He reentered Lesley's life and confessed his love to her. Gordon was about to leave Florence and start a new life with Lesley. She asked Dr. Steve Hardy to be taken off the case. Lesley convinced Gordon to stay with his wife. She was then tormented by the memories of giving birth, and losing her daughter. Shortly after Lesley married Cameron Faulkner, she found out that the daughter who she thought has died was only living miles from her away. Lesley did a little research and found out that her daughter Laura was adopted by Jason and Barbara Vining. Lesley was desperate to see her daughter again, but Cameron ordered her to stay away from Laura and never make contact to her. Lesley started meeting Laura anyway. Barbara and Jason got curious about Laura's new friendship and soon had to realize that Lesley was Laura's biological mother. As Laura found out the truth, she is thrilled. Lesley is later granted full custody of Laura. When Laura fell ill and Peter told her that the illness was emotional based, Lesley decided to return Laura to the Vinings. Cameron was thrilled about that development. Lesley couldn't get over losing Laura again. Cameron started an affair with his secretary Peggy and was determined to get Laura out of Lesley's life for good. He first paid an elderly nurse to convince Lesley that Laura isn't even her daughter. As this didn't work, Cameron paid the Vinings a lot of money to move away with Laura. When Lesley found out about Cameron's scheme to keep her from her daughter, he kidnapped Lesley. As Cameron was driving Lesley grabbed the steering wheel and the car lunged off the road killing Cameron. Lesley's colleague Rick Webber started comforting Lesley. As Rick tried to stay away from his brother's wife Monica, he spent more time with Lesley and helped her over the miscarriage of her late husband's baby. Monica became jealous over Rick's friendship with Lesley. Monica confronted Lesley, told her to stay away from Rick and that they were having an affair. Rick and Lesley got closer anyway and Rick helped Lesley to find Laura. Lesley was left crushed when Laura wanted to have nothing to do with her anymore. Rick eventually got through to Laura, telling her how much Lesley loved her and that she never gave up on her. Lesley was grateful to Rick and filled with joy when he confessed his love for her and proposed. Lesley and Rick were eventually married. A man by the name of David Hamilton was admitted to General Hospital and turns out to be an old college friend of Rick's. David's wife and children were killed, while David was left paralyzed. The doctors couldn't find out why David was unable to walk and he was released. He accepted Rick's offer to stay with him and Lesley to recuperate. While Lesley thought something was strange about David, Laura cared for him. Soon David got his own apartment and tried to make a pass at Lesley who rejected him. Lesley confessed to Rick's brother Jeff about what happened with David. Jeff swore he wouldn't tell Rick. David moved on to Laura after Lesley rejected him and started a secret romantic relationship with the young girl. David was only using Laura to get to Lesley. As David told Laura the truth, that he was really in love with Lesley, Laura pushed David to fall. Lesley later discovered David's body. In an effort to protect Laura, Lesley decided to confess to murdering David. Laura felt guilty and ran away. She eventually returned and confessed to the murder. The charges against Lesley were dropped and Laura sentenced to six months probation. Lesley and Rick's marriage became troubled when Lesley started to think that Rick and Monica were having another affair. As General Hospital was put under quarantine, Monica and Rick were among the doctors working at the hospital. After everyone was free from the quarantine Monica and Rick slept together. While Monica was sure of her feelings for Rick, he told her that they would need time to figure things out. Laura's car accident let Rick rethink his involvement with Monica and he told her that they are over for good. Monica reconciled with her husband, Alan Quartermaine, as she discovered that she is pregnant. In the meanwhile, Lesley and Rick started to think about a baby of their own. Lesley was unable to conceive as it would put her life in danger. Laura's adopted sister Amy Vining moved to Port Charles around this time to become a nurse and Rick and Lesley welcomed her into their home, often amused by her tendency for gossip but sometimes overwhelmed by it. Lesley ended up delivering Monica's baby. As Monica feared that she wouldn't survive, she tells Lesley that the baby is Rick's. Lesley and Rick separated after he tried to tell her about his affair with Monica and Lesley told him that she already was aware. Rick found out that Alan Jr. could be his son and filed a suit against Monica. Lesley, still being in love with Rick, supported him and even agreed to a divorce so that he could claim his son. It was later discovered that Alan Jr. was in fact Alan's son and not Rick's. During this time, Lesley allowed her former sister-in-law Heather to stay with her when Heather was released from a mental institution after having accidentally taken an overdose of L.S.D. several years before. Lesley was supportive of Heather's mother, Alice Grant, when it was revealed that she had shot Lesley's hospital co-worker Diana Taylor in an effort to keep Diana from killing Heather. Lesley and Rick remarried and adopted a six- year-old boy named Mike. As Laura disappeared and was presumed dead, Lesley was crushed and had a hard time dealing with the fact that her daughter is dead. Lesley and Rick eventually became foster parents to Blackie Parrish after his mother died. With three young wards living in their home, the Webber residence was never quiet. When Blackie entered the music business, Rick noticed a change in Blackie's personality. He became arrogant and shallow. Blackie ends up accidentally killing his girlfriend Lou. He was arrested and sentenced to time in prison. An old enemy of Rick's, D. L. Brock, comes to town. He wants revenge on Rick for closing his cannery when Rick was part of the Port Charles Health Commission. Brock brings Ginny Blake to town, who's claiming to be Mike's biological mother. Bobbie Spencer, Brock's wife, figured out that Ginny might be in on the revenge against Rick and warned Lesley. She confronted Ginny and then Lesley ended up in a car accident and was killed. =1996‚Äì2005= It was revealed that Lesley was in fact alive in 1996. Stefan Cassadine, son of Mikkos and brother of Stavros who had kidnapped Laura years ago was keeping Lesley drugged in a catatonic state. Lesley and Laura were reunited and, with Luke's help, they faked their deaths to escape the Cassadines. When they returned months later, their friends and family turned against them out of hurt. Stefan blackmailed Laura into leaving town once more. She lied to Luke that her mother needed treatment in Switzerland and took Lulu with them. In 1998, they returned and Lesley took over being a mother to Laura and grandmother to Laura's sons Nikolas and Lucky and daughter Lesley Lu. In 2002, a now divorced Rick Webber returned to give his daughter Laura away again at her second wedding to Luke Spencer. Rick was happy to see Lesley alive and well again but his flirtations with old flame Monica upset Lesley and made Monica's husband, Alan, extremely jealous. His return made Laura remember some terrible events. She began having flashbacks involving the garage attic, including wearing a dress covered in blood. Rick and Scott Baldwin could tell that Laura was remembering and tried to prevent the truth from coming out. Years ago Rick was having an affair with nurse Theresa Carter and Laura walked in on them in the attic. Theresa had gotten violent and Laura took an antique camera and hit Theresa over the head with it. It killed her and Rick and Scott buried her in the back yard. Rick then gave Laura a certain drug for her to forget that night. When Rick encountered Laura in the Webber attic, she freaked out and presumably hit him over the head which caused his death. The horror of the events caused Laura to slip into a mental state of catatonia which caused much grief for Luke, Lesley, and in her last appearance, Amy. Lesley not only had to deal with the loss of the love of her life but the prospect of losing her daughter whom she had struggled hard years before to find and reconnect with. =2006‚Äì09= In October 2006, Luke gave Robin Scorpio, now a doctor, his permission to give Laura an experimental drug called LS-49 that would temporarily bring her out of her catatonic state. The drug worked and everyone in Laura's life were overjoyed to have her back for the 3 weeks. In that time. Laura made Luke take her back to the Scorpio attic so she could remember what happened between her and Rick Webber the night she killed her stepfather four years ago; she painfully, tearfully did remember. Lesley, along with Laura's children, the Quartermaines, and the rest of LnL's loved ones were in attendance at Luke and Laura got remarried like they were going to do before Laura had her breakdown. The lavish ceremony took place in Lila's rose garden per Laura's wishes. The marriage was fake however as Luke was married to Tracy Quartermaine at the time. The minister who performed the ceremony was only an actor who Luke had hired to perform it. He only went along with it because it meant so much to Laura and he wanted to make what time she had left as meaningful and memorable as possible. Lesley and the rest were devastated when Laura slowly but finally slipped back into her catatonic state. Before her goodbye with Lulu, Laura told her daughter that she didn't believe that she had actually killed Rick Webber, but not to tell Luke this because it would break his heart. (Luke telling Laura that she killed her stepfather is what actually pushed her to really have her breakdown and into her catatonic state) Lulu vowed to pursue the matter and find Rick's real killer. After Alan died from a heart attack during the Metro Court Hotel hostage crisis during February sweeps, Lulu and her stepbrother Dillon Quartermaine intercepted a letter addressed to Luke which was to be delivered to him after Alan's death. In the letter, it says that Scott Baldwin is actually the one who killed Rick that night. When Lulu confronts a recently returned to town during the hostage crisis Scott about the letter, he eventually confirms it. He went to the Scorpio house that night to check on Laura and upon hearing her scream found her in the attic fighting with Rick. He was the one who hit him on the head with the candlestick, unintentionally killing him, to stop him from giving Laura the drug. He left just before Luke arrived on the scene and came to the only possible conclusion that he could think of: in an altercation, with Laura's current state of mind, she thought Rick was trying to hurt her so she hit him with the now bloody candlestick and accidentally killed him. Telling her this is what sent her into her catatonic state. Lulu decided that she could never tell her father what she has learned because it would destroy him; he would either a) kill Scott Baldwin for his part and be sent to jail for murder and she would never see him again or b) he would want to kill Scott and he would feel so guilty and heartbroken that he was the one who caused Laura's catatonia telling her something so traumatic when it didn't even happen. Lesley attended Lucky and Elizabeth's second marriage in March, where she was also introduced to Spinelli when he interrupted the ceremony when the minister asked \\"if anyone knew why they should not be joined . . .\\" Spinelli only stood up because it looked like Lulu was about to tell everyone that Elizabeth's baby was really Jason's and not Lucky's. Spinelli recovered and the marriage took place. Lesley returned to the front-burner temporarily on October 30, 2008 when Scott kidnapped Laura and took her to Los Angeles. She assisted Lucky, Lulu, and Nikolas in finding her location. Laura is eventually found and is leaving Port Charles for Paris to seek further treatment. Not known to anyone at first, Laura is followed by Scott. Lesley attended Lucky and Elizabeth's engagement party in October 2009 and then disappeared off-screen. She stayed for a while with Laura in Paris, where she became aware that her daughter and Scott got closer again. Not liking Laura and Scott's new found friendship, Lesley joins Nikolas at Lake Como in Italy. =2013= As of March 2013, Lesley is said to be staying at Nikolas' house in Italy and is taking care of his son Spencer. A couple of weeks later, Lesley returns to Port Charles with Spencer to reunite him with his father. She is surprised to learn of Laura's plans to remarry Scott. Lesley disapproves of Laura's plans and confronts Scott with the murder of her husband, Rick Webber. Laura pleads with Lesley and hopes that she forgive Scott's past mistakes. Scott promises Lesley that he cares for Laura and wants only what's best for her. Not wanting to stay in their way, Lesley gives them her blessing even though she's not happy about it. After Mayor Lomax is unable to perform Laura and Scott's wedding, Lesley jumps in as she's able to officiate the ceremony. At the wedding, Lesley also reunites with her granddaughter Lulu who was recently kidnapped by Stavros Cassadine and since then can't remember her previous life. Lesley becomes aware of Nikolas' interest in Elizabeth, who's attending the ceremony with Monica's son AJ. Later on, Lesley put on a doctor's jacket for the first time in almost 30 years when she pretended to still be a doctor in order to gain information on Luke's medical condition, but ended up being confronted by old rival Monica. After exchanging barbs, Monica allowed Lesley to get the information she was seeking when Lesley pleaded to Monica's motherly instincts. After coming back from escorting Laura to France, Lesley decided to remain in town. On Halloween night, Lesley passed out when she opened the Wyndemere door to find Faison standing there. Later on, old rival Monica was invited over for an off-screen visit with Lesley which included old hospital pals Gail Baldwin and Audrey Hardy where Lesley gave Monica a gift of a painting which unbeknownst to them was painted by Heather! =2017= Lesley returns in 2017 for Laura's wedding to Kevin Collins, and ends up officiating the ceremony.

Both parties then received a previously settled portion of the profit. The agent was not liable for any losses, provided these did not exceed the capital subscribed. (In later Hanafi jurisprudence, the agent had no authority to incur liabilities in excess of the capital, and so would have to bear any further losses personally.Al- Majalla / The Ottoman Courts Manual, s. 1416) In modern Islamic finance, the term \\"Mudarabah\\" is used for the same instrument. \\"Mudarabah\\" is derived from \\"al-darb al-ard\\", which is mentioned in the Quran, however \\"Mudarabah\\" as a term technically has no explicit basis in the Quran and Sunnah.Sapuan, Noraina Mazuin. \\"An evolution of Mudarabah contract: a viewpoint from classical and contemporary Islamic scholars.\\" Procedia economics and finance 35, no. 3 (2016): 349-358.  Origins and history  Although the qirad is never mentioned in the Qur'an, many Islamic traditions attribute its origin to the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. These traditions describe Muhammad and his companions either using the qirad or endorsing the institutionAvram Udovitch, \\"Partnership and Profit in Medieval Islam\\", (Princeton University Press, 1970) p. 170 Many will notice that the qirad is almost identical to the institution of the commenda later used in western Europe, though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.Robert H. Hillman, \\"Limited Liability in Historical Perspective\\", (Washington and Lee Law Review, Spring 1997), Benedikt Koehler, \\"Islamic Finance as a Progenitor of Venture Capital\\", (Economic Affairs, December 2009)  Legal technicalities  Though there existed several different major schools of Islamic law, the basic legalities of the qirad were rather uniform throughout the schools. Dinars and dirhams, as well as gold, silver, and copper coins in circulation were allowed to be invested. However, goods such as barley were restricted from the qirad because the possible fluctuations in their value in the free market.Udovitch op cit pp. 177-181 In the Mongol Empire, the contractual features of a Mongol-ortoq partnership closely resembled that of qirad arrangements, however, Mongol investors were not constrained using uncoined precious metals and tradable goods for partnership investments.Enerelt Enkhbold, 2019. \\"The role of the ortoq in the Mongol Empire in forming business partnerships\\", Central Asian Survey 38 (4), 1-17 The agent was allowed to take the investment and split up his investments in any way, as well as invest in anything he wanted,Malik ibn Anas, al-Muwatta', 280-282 (Kegan Paul International, 1989) except in cases where stocks are plentiful and not seasonally bound.Malik's Muwatta 32.3.5 It was also permissible for an investor to forbid the agent from buying certain kinds of goods. Many of the third parties involved in the qirad were actually unaware of their involvement which allowed the agent to trade freely and without liability.Hillman op cit Although the fractional split in profit was agreed on beforehand, the investor could not stipulate a specific sum of the money from the profit, or that a certain profit be made. In this way, the qirad remained a complete risk on the investor and did not infringe on the free market economy.,Udovitch op cit, pp. 190-193Malik op cit It was however possible to make a deal on the split of the profit beforehand by stipulating a specific percentage. This could be either a low or a high percentage. The principal investment can not be paid back, either by the investor ending the agreement, or the agent ending the agreement, if the principal is still invested in goods. The goods must be sold before the principal can be handed back, and the profits split.Malik's Muwatta 32.4.6 On the other hand, the investor is allowed to buy goods from the agent if he does not connect any conditions to this transaction.Malik's Muwatta 32.2.3 The agent can also ask the help of a servant of the investor, but this servant also has to share in the profit and can not be asked to do any other work than work connected to the investment. A servant can also invest in the same investment as his master and also shares in the profit. If the agent has to hire help for a job, the wage for this person can be paid from the principal, except if the wage should result in loss for the investor, the agent himself is responsible for whatever is not covered by the principal.Malik's Muwatta 32.6.8 The agent can use the principal for food and clothes if he should travel for his business, and the principal is large enough to allow it. If he stays at home this is not allowed.Malik's Muwatta 32.8.10 An agent can invest the money of an investor, the agent then becomes an investor himself, but he is then liable for the losses of the second agent. If the principal decreases, the original investor is allowed to ask the original agent to cover the loss.Malik's Muwatta 32.7.9  Notes  Category:Islamic banking Category:Islamic jurisprudence Category:Investment Category:Medieval Islam Category:Islamic banking and finance terminology ","title":"Qirad"},{"id":"9905025","text":"Wallis‚ÄìZieff‚ÄìGoldblatt syndrome is a rare condition characterized by inherited skeletal disorders manifested mainly as rhizomelic short stature and lateral clavicular defects.

History The station began broadcasts in December 1996, when Jack LeDuc resurrected the WJLW call letters and its country music format one year after selling its previous home at 95.9 FM. LeDuc ran WJLW until March 1998, when he decided to sell a second time. The new owners, Cumulus Media, changed the station to \\"106.7 The Eagle,\\" airing a classic rock format.

Function  Prolyl endopeptidase is a large cytosolic enzyme that belongs to a distinct class of serine peptidases. It was first described in the cytosol of rabbit brain as an oligopeptidase, which degrades the nonapeptide bradykinin at the Pro-Phe bond. The enzyme is involved in the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone, angiotensin, neurotensin, oxytocin, substance P and vasopressin. PREP cleaves peptide bonds at the C-terminal side of proline residues. Its activity is confined to action on oligopeptides of less than 10 kD and it has an absolute requirement for the trans-configuration of the peptide bond preceding proline. Prolyl endopeptidases are involved in the maturation and degradation of peptide hormones and neuropeptides.  Structure  Prolyl endopeptidase is a cytosolic prolyl endopeptidase that cleaves peptide bonds on the C-terminal side of prolyl residues within peptides that are up to approximately 30 amino acids long. Only short protein residues are able to enter the active site of prolyl endopeptidase due to the distinct beta-propeller region that acts as a gating filter mechanism.  Clinical significance  Altered PREP activity may be associated with autism spectrum disorders and various psychological diseases such as schizophrenia, mania and clinical depression. However, there is conflicting information as to the exact role that prolyl endopeptidase plays in the pathophysiology of depression, with earlier studies documenting a decreased activity of the enzyme in depressed patients, but more recent studies demonstrating that inhibition of the same enzyme actually results in alleviation of depressive symptoms. Some types of prolyl endopeptidase have been used in studies to decrease the propensity of gluten-containing wheat products to aggravate coeliac disease. However, orally administered enzymes are potentially subject to inactivation in the gastrointestinal tract.  Inhibitors  Several prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors are known, and have been suggested as possible nootropic and antidepressant drugs.

Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 32 N.J. 358, 161 A.2d 69 (N.J. 1960), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that an automobile manufacturer's attempt to use an express warranty that disclaimed an implied warranty of merchantability was invalid.  Facts  On May 7, 1955, Mr. Claus H. Henningsen purchased a Plymouth automobile, manufactured by Chrysler Corporation, from Bloomfield Motors, Inc. The automobile was intended as a Mother's Day gift to his wife, Helen, and the purchase was executed solely by Mr. Henningsen. The contract for sale was a one-page form and contained paragraphs in various type sizes on the front and back of the form. Mr. Henningsen testified he did not read all paragraphs of the contract. The back of the contract contained the following clause: > The manufacturer warrants each new motor vehicle (including original > equipment placed thereon by the manufacturer except tires), chassis or parts > manufactured by it to be free from defects in material or workmanship under > normal use and service. Its obligation under this warranty being limited to > making good at its factory any part or parts thereof which shall, within > ninety (90) days after delivery of such vehicle To the original purchaser or > before such vehicle has been driven 4,000 miles, whichever event shall first > occur, be returned to it with transportation charges prepaid and which its > examination shall disclose to its satisfaction to have been thus defective; > This warranty being expressly in lieu of all other warranties expressed or > implied, and all other obligations or liabilities on its part, and it > neither assumes nor authorizes any other person to assume for it any other > liability in connection with the sale of its vehicles. The car was delivered on May 9, 1955. There were no problems with the car until May 19, 1955. On that day, Mrs. Henningsen was driving the car at 20-22 mph on a smooth two lane highway. Mrs. Henningsen then heard a loud noise, the steering wheel spun in her hands, and the car suddenly veered and collided with a wall. The car was damaged severely, and declared totaled by the Henningsens' insurance carrier. The defendants refused to repair the car under warranty since they claimed the express warranty was limited only to repairing the defective parts and that it was not liable for damages caused by defective parts.  Procedure  Mr. and Mrs. Henningsen sued under a theory of negligence and a theory of warranty. The court felt the proof was not sufficient to make out a prima facie case of negligence and gave the case to the jury solely on the warranty theory. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Henningsen, against both defendants. The appellate case was argued on December 7, 1959 and was decided on May 9, 1960.  Holding  Automobile purchasers may recover for damages caused by defective parts under an implied warranty of merchantability since automobile manufacturers and dealers may not limit this warranty to replacement of only defective parts as this violates fair dealing and public policy.  Reasoning  Automobiles were sold by the automobile manufacturer to the automobile dealer, who in turn sells them to consumers. Therefore, there is no privity between the automobile manufacturer and the consumer. While a majority of courts, at this time, hold privity is required for the manufacturer to be liable to the consumer, there is a trend towards eliminating privity as a requirement. It is unjust for the manufacturer to benefit from advertising their product as suitable as a car and profit from this representation, while providing a basic implied warranty that what they are providing matches what they represent they are providing. Therefore, an implied warranty accompanies every car the manufacturer puts into the stream of trade. The express warranty signed by Mr. Henningsen will apply under contract law even if he did not read all of it. The warranty agreement, which is a standard used by all major automobile manufacturers, seems to disguise the limitations of the warranty coverage. The jury verdict at trial established this disclaimer was not fairly obtained, and, therefore, the disclaimer will not apply to the situation at hand. Therefore, damages under implied warranty will stand. Further, the contract is one of adhesion and Mr. Henningsen had no chance to bargain on its terms. The defendants took advantage of their relative bargaining power to force unfair disclaimers upon the customer, and since this disclaimer of any warranty except one for replacement of defective parts violates public policy.  Commentary  Some law and economics scholars have criticized this result as it will ultimately raise prices as automobile manufacturers and dealers have to pay for implied warranty costs. This results in an economically inefficient transaction since not all consumers wanted this warranty, but now all consumers are forced to pay for it. New Jersey courts, attorneys and scholars frequently cite Henningsen as the landmark case that established strict liability for defective products in the United States. However, the majority of US courts, attorneys, and law professors usually cite Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. and the Supreme Court of California as the source of the doctrine. Although Henningsen helped articulate the rationale for the then-imminent shift from implied warranty to strict liability as the dominant theory of American product liability, the case never actually imposes \\"strict liability\\" or \\"absolute liability\\" for defective products.

Around 1900, Dr. Richard H. Stein, a Berlin musicologist made the first quarter-tone clarinet, which was soon abandoned. Using special fingerings, quarter tones may be produced by a skilled player on a conventional clarinet. In However, such fingerings are awkward in rapid passages, and results tend to vary from one clarinet to another. In the 1920s Alois H√°ba commissioned a quarter tone clarinet from the Kohlert company of Grazlitz.Hoeprich, Eric (2008). The Clarinet, p.293. . In 1937, another German, the instrument builder Fritz Sch√ºller (1883-1977) of Markneukirchen made an attempt to create a quarter tone clarinet to overcome these problems. It consisted of a single mouthpiece connected to two parallel bores, one slightly longer than the other; effectively these were two clarinets tuned a quarter tone apart. A single set of keywork controlled the tone holes of both bores simultaneously, and a valve was provided to switch rapidly from one bore to the other. Music for quarter tone clarinet has been written by Eric Mandat, Alois H√°ba (Sonata and Matka), Viktor Ullmann, and by some various jazz musicians through the late 20th century. Other composers, such as B√©la Bart√≥k and Pierre Boulez, wrote for conventional clarinet using quarter tones.

The two superpowers, each believing the other has launched a first strike, retaliate. By the time American president Cole and a Russian premier with the first name Mikhail have realized their errors, their fully automated nuclear-missile systems can not be countermanded. Only hours before the apocalypse begins, a Saturn VI rocket launches bearing three astronauts: Captain Boyd Ellis, United States Air Force; his fianc√©e, Jill Malden; and Japanese physicist Ikei Yashida. Weeks later, after the post-apocalyptic radiation has subsided to safe levels, their space capsule lands upon a melting Greenland ice field, where the three ally themselves with Kuno, a 3rd-century Goth revived from his ice-encased suspended animation. The four encounter a Russian scientist/cyborg in Canada, where they commandeer a futuristic jet plane; undersea dwellers; and brutish U.S. military survivors, among others.

Her paintings and illustrations featured Alaska Native children, Yupik villagers and Arctic wildlife. She painted in watercolor and oil. Personal life Joan developed an interest in drawing as a small girl. Joan Arend married Roland Gene Kickbush, who was nicknamed \\"Kick\\". In 1953 Kickbush and her husband Roland moved to Anchorage, Alaska where they both worked as a teachers and Kickbush painted. They built their first home in 1960 in Anchorage. By 1978 Kickbush and her husband left Alaska to live in the Lower 48 states. They lived in Bend, Oregon; California and Carefree, Arizona. She died on June 16, 2006. Roland died in California on June 25, 2009. In 1965 it was reported that the couple had no children, and there were no children mentioned in Roland's obituary. Career Before moving to Anchorage in 1953, she was a commercial artist in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Hawaii. Once she settled in Anchorage, however, there was little opportunity for a commercial artist. She was a kindergarten teacher when she took an Alaskan teacher's tour to Kotzebue and Nome in 1955. From that time, she embarked on what became a career painting Alaska Native (Inupiat‚ÄìYupik) children. Her paintings of the \\"wide-eyed\\" children were popular, and journalist Phyllis Eilleen Lancaster stated that: \\"Her style is realistic, with the charm and appeal of Hummel figurines.\\" At an exhibit in 1963 at the Alaska Art Gallery, 40 of her watercolors and oils of native children were shown. It was her first Interior Alaska art showing. Shed exhibited her work at the House of Wood, a local gallery in Fairbanks. The couple purchased a plane that Roland piloted so that they could travel to remote villages in Alaska. She made paintings in her studio of scenes she had sketched during their visits, and he matted and framed her works. The Siberian Yupik village of Savoonga on St. Lawrence Island was her favorite subject. At a United Nations tea in Anchorage in or before 1965, Hubert Humphrey's wife, Muriel Buck Humphrey, was given one of Kickbush's works. The Alaska Crippled Children's Association gave a painting to the head chaplain and it hung in his Washington D.C. office. The University of Wisconsin had her works in a permanent collection. An exhibition of her watercolor and oils was held at the Alaska Art Gallery in Fairbanks from November 18 to December 2, 1966. The Frye Art Museum in Seattle held an exhibition of Kickbush's works in November, 1977. It featured her paintings of Alaska Native children. At that time she and her husband were living in Bend, Oregon, and she made paintings from sketches she had previously made during visits to Alaskan villages. Her trademark technique was to \\"transfer the sketches to pressed board and after applying oils, uses a palette knife technique to produce a jewel-like finish;\\" Her oils obtained a matte finish through the use of artists' wax. During her career as a commercial artist she cleaned many brushes, so when she began working on her own she preferred the palette knife and only used a brush to sign a painting. Kickbush wrote and illustrated several coloring books that were popular with Alaska Natives because the images were so lifelike. She illustrated a textbook, This is Alaska, and created a line of stationery and Christmas cards. Kickbush worked in pastels, ink, charcoal and watercolors.

He later played in the Arena Football League for the Arizona Rattlers, Milwaukee Mustangs, and Georgia Force. College Davis's college career began in the wake of the 1990 National Championship run under Head Coach Bobby Ross. Davis redshirted in 1991 and would await the graduation of star quarterback Shawn Jones through his redshirt freshman and sophomore seasons. Bobby Ross would leave before Davis's sophomore season and Bill Lewis was appointed head coach. The team, 2 years removed from a National Title, only won five games and finished the 1992 season with a 5‚Äì6 record. His redshirt sophomore campaign began with a thrashing of Furman but over the next three games Georgia Tech would be outscored 102‚Äì27. Davis would finish the year with a 5‚Äì6 record and a loss to archrival Georgia. Bill Lewis wanted a spark for his wilting team so he recruited junior college transfer Tom Luginbill from Palomar. Luginbill came in from a wide open pass offense where he tossed for over 7,600 yards and had won 21 games in two years. Luginbill would eventually take the starting job from Davis after Davis got injured in spring practice. Luginbill's first two efforts in 1994 saw Georgia Tech narrowly lose to then #1 Arizona and demolish Western Carolina. Luginbill's career ended at Georgia Tech with a 1‚Äì10 record and the firing of Coach Bill Lewis. Lewis was replaced by defensive coordinator George O'Leary. After Luginbill transferred to Eastern Kentucky, Davis and O'Leary began a major rebuilding of the Georgia Tech football program that would lead Georgia Tech eventually back to playing in bowls and competing at the highest level in the ACC.

With his keen talents and technological savvy he programmed a Yamaha workstation keyboard with Afghani taals or rhythms. As time went on, with newer technology and the introduction of MIDI, he introduced the Roland R8 drum machine which is still used by Afghan singers today. This drum machine along, with its ethnic tabla card, increased the precision and audio visualization of a full Afghan band controlled by one man. He was also responsible for introducing the Technics line of keyboards to the Afghan music scene. He quickly became the most popular Afghan singer in America. he was constantly performing at events in California, Texas, New York, Maryland and Virginia as well as Canada. His love and devotion to music led him to create dozens of songs which remain hits till this day, such as \\"Gadi wan\\", \\"Jaan-0-Jaanan em Naroo\\" and \\"Ay Dilbaram\\". Sharqi was a singer who sang with a unique and soft melodious voice. His ability to maintain a note for very long periods of time was a testament to his superb talent and practice. He also mastered the art of moving smoothly and powerfully from a low note and octave quickly to a very high note and octave. This style was used by only one other Afghan singer, the legendary Ahmad Zahir. He was also known for being the king of rhythms. He had a great amount of knowledge with percussion instruments so that his beats were programmed very realistically and attractively for the listener. The demand for his music was very high and at times impossible to satisfy. His productive and generous career abruptly came to a stop in late summer 1994 when he arrived home from a multi-state tour. He complained of pains in his chest and soon after collapsed and had a devastating stroke. His heart gave up on him and paramedics quickly arrived to perform CPR. They managed to get his heart pumping again and he went to hospital. He remained in a coma for three months. His elder mother sat by his bedside along with his best friend/brother Siddiq Alim. After waking from his coma, Sharqi suffered from serious brain damage. A few days after leaving the hospital he became dizzy and collapsed, hitting his head on the pavement. This led him to go back to the hospital. This accident resulted in a blood clot in his brain and destroyed his short-term memory capabilities and affected his basic motor skills. He dedicated his life to sharing his golden voice and musical talents. He had gone nights and nights without sleep and constantly traveled by car, gig after gig, state after state, night after night. In the end, this took a huge toll on his body. Today, Sharqi is alive, contrary to rumors that his stroke was tragic. He lives with his mother in Arlington, Virginia. He is but a memory of the musical legend and icon that so many Afghans grew up listening to in the 1980s and 1990s. He is too sick to play keyboards or sing. His brain damage is permanent and there is very little hope of him making a full recovery.

The index is calculated based on the distribution of citations received by a given researcher's publications, such that given a set of articles ranked in decreasing order of the number of citations that they received, the g-index is the unique largest number such that the top g articles received together at least g2 citations. It can be equivalently defined as the largest number n of highly cited articles for which the average number of citations is at least n. This is in fact a rewriting of the definition An example of a g-index (the raw citation data, plotted with stars, allows the h-index to also be extracted for comparison). :g^2 \\\\le \\\\sum_c_{i} as :g \\\\le \\\\frac1g \\\\sum_c_{i} The g-index is an alternative for the older h-index, which does not average the numbers of citations. The h-index only requires a minimum of n citations for the least- cited article in the set and thus ignores the citation count of very highly cited papers. Roughly, the effect is that h is the number of papers of a quality threshold that rises as h rises; g allows citations from higher-cited papers to be used to bolster lower-cited papers in meeting this threshold. Therefore, in all cases g is at least h, and is in most cases higher. However, unlike the h-index, the g-index saturates whenever the average number of citations for all published papers exceeds the total number of published papers; the way it is defined, the g-index is not adapted to this situation. The g-index has been characterized in terms of three natural axioms by Woeginger (2008). The simplest of these three axioms states that by moving citations from weaker articles to stronger articles, one's research index should not decrease. Like the h-index, the g-index is a natural number and thus lacks in discriminatory power. Therefore, Tol (2008) proposed a rational generalisation. preprint Tol also proposed a collective g-index. :Given a set of researchers ranked in decreasing order of their g-index, the g1-index is the (unique) largest number such that the top g1 researchers have on average at least a g-index of g1.

Devlin was born at Buncrana, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1814, the son of Jeremiah Devlin, a farmer and merchant tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth Foster. As a young merchant tailor, Daniel emigrated to America in 1833. Three younger brothers later joined him in America; two sisters, and a brother, Phillip Devlin, who became a Catholic priest, remained in Ireland. Daniel Devlin moved to Louisville, Kentucky, and is believed to have worked for a time as a steamboat clerk on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, which led him to encourage his brother William Devlin to establish himself in Louisiana. Devlin founded a jeans manufacturing company in Louisville, and later moved to New York City, where he and two of his brothers established a clothing company, Devlin Brothers. Daniel Devlin was named City Chamberlain of New York in 1861, and remained in that position until his death. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, he headed the executive committee charged with recruitment and financing for the Irish Brigade of the Union Army. In politics, he was a Democrat, and played a prominent role in the New York State Democratic convention in 1864. He was a director of the Union Trust Company of New York, and a prominent Catholic layman who in 1863 helped found the Society for the Protection of Destitute Roman Catholic Children in the City of New York and in 1864 established a scholarship at St. Francis Xavier College. Devlin lived from the 1850s onward in an Italianate villa overlooking the Hudson River in Manhattanville. Devlin died in New York on February 22, 1867. His brothers donated a stained glass window in his memory to St. Patrick's Cathedral, where it can be seen today.

They disbanded in 2003, with all members pursuing other projects. History Both The Agency and The Vacant Andys were South Florida bands active around the time that Dashboard Confessional was gaining momentum. Marsh and Bonebrake formed Seville with ex-Vacant Andy John Owens and ex- Agency Chris Drueke. Seville quickly recorded the first 6-song e.p. \\"Waiting In Seville\\" on Fiddler Records and went on tour with Dashboard Confessional. By the end of 2001, Seville had already toured with Ben Kweller, Sense Field, Duvall, Further Seems Forever, Ultimate Fakebook, Midtown, and Rival Schools. After that tour, Marsh became a full-time member of Dashboard Confessional, while Bonebrake remained in Seville. Drueke at this time became the primary vocalist , and they recruited Kris King (Against All Authority/Machete) on drums. This line-up recorded four songs for a split release with Duvall and subsequent tour in the summer of 2002. Midway through the tour all the members of Seville realized that the personality conflicts and the chemistry without Mike was just not enough to keep going. The band parted ways on the second night of tour with Schatzi. In the van ride home, the guys gave Chris Drueke their blessings to continue with Seville should he so desire. Chris Drueke then recorded what was intended to be a solo CD entitled \\"Take Me Home.\\" Through some prodding from friends, family, and the record label, the CD was released under the name Seville in early 2003. Though Drueke released a live recording of an acoustic performance under the name Seville, the band's life was practically over. Current projects Mike Marsh and Chris Drueke have since reunited with Klaus Ketelhohn to revive The Agency. The new CD from the Agency entitled \\"Turn\\" will be released February 6 on Perch/Eulogy. Dan Bonebrake is currently playing with Vagrant Record's John Ralston, and John Owens is playing with ex-Vacant Andy Darryl Bonebrake in Band No. 12\\\\.

After installation, it added a new \\"Ubuntu\\" option to the existing Windows boot menu which allowed the user to choose between running Linux or Windows, and avoided the need to re-partition the disk. History Wubi was born as an independent project and as such versions 7.04 and 7.10 were unofficial releases. For Ubuntu 8.04 the code was merged into Ubuntu and for 8.04 alpha 5, Wubi was also on the Ubuntu Live CD. The project's aim was to enable existing Windows users, unacquainted with Linux, to try Ubuntu without risking any data loss (due to disk formatting or partitioning mistakes). It could also safely uninstall Ubuntu from within Windows. It is not a virtual machine, but creates a stand-alone installation within a loopmounted device, also known as a disk image, like Topologilinux does. It is not a Linux distribution of its own, but rather an installer for Ubuntu. While Wubi does not install Ubuntu directly to its own partition this can also be accomplished by using LVPM, the Loopmounted Virtual Partition Manager, to transfer the Wubi-generated Ubuntu installation to a dedicated real partition, including a bootable USB keydrive. The advantage of this setup is that users can test the operating system and install the drivers before they install it to a dedicated partition (and avoid booting and functioning risks). A boot menu in Windows 7 showing options to start Ubuntu, which was added by the Wubi installer. Wubi adds an entry to the Windows boot menu which allows the user to run Linux. Ubuntu is installed within a file in the Windows file system (c:\\\\ubuntu\\\\disks\\\\root.disk), as opposed to being installed within its own partition. This file is seen by Linux as a real hard disk. Wubi also creates a swap file in the Windows file system (c:\\\\ubuntu\\\\disks\\\\swap.disk), in addition to the memory of the host machine. This file is seen by Ubuntu as additional RAM. A related project, Lubi, used Linux as the host system instead of Windows. However, this project has not been worked on since 2007 and only works on Ubuntu 7.04. Wubi was removed as an installation option in the official download page from Ubuntu 13.04 onward. However, Wubi for versions after Ubuntu 13.04 are still provided. An unofficial fork of Wubi, called wubiuefi, supports UEFI and newer versions of Ubuntu (as of 2017-10-30, version 16.04.3 and 17.10). Desktops Users can select the desktop environment within Wubi. But, because each desktop environment is also available as an application package, it is recommended that users install Ubuntu (default option) and from there install the other desktop environments. When users log in, they can choose the desktop environment to use. Limitations Compared with a regular installation, a Wubi installation faces some limitations. Hibernation is not supported and the filesystem is more vulnerable to hard reboots. Also, if the Windows drive is unmounted uncleanly (Windows crash, power failure, etc.), Ubuntu will not be able to repair, re-mount, and boot from the Windows NTFS drive until Microsoft Windows has successfully booted, repaired the drive, and then shut down cleanly. If the Windows system could not be booted after the corruption to repair the filesystem, the user would also not be able to boot Ubuntu. Performance related to hard-disk access is also slightly slower on a Wubi install, more so if the underlying disk image file is fragmented, as the disk image file in the Windows filesystem contains a Linux filesystem whereas without Wubi only the Linux filesystem is used that has direct hardware access. Wubi creates the root.disk file using Microsoft's proprietary NTFS file system while running under the MS Windows OS and then while the Ubuntu OS is running it accesses that file using an alternative file system driver. The differences between the Microsoft and Linux implementations of NTFS could technically result in corruption of the root.disk file that affects the NTFS filesystem in such a way that it could even prevent Windows from booting. Running chkdsk /r from MS Windows to fix the damaged NTFS file system and then shutting down Windows cleanly may fix any corruptions (this may take a significant amount of time to run as root.disk is a large file). Influences Wubi relies on other open source projects: Debian installer, Migration Assistant, Grub4Dos, NTFS-3G, NSIS and Metalink. Development The lead developers are Agostino Russo, Geza Kovacs, Oliver Mattos and Ecology2007. The main development occurs at Launchpad and is led by the Lupin Team (Lupin is the loop-installer, handles everything that happens after reboot) through the original Ubuntu blueprint page and the new Wubi, Lubi, Lupin, and LVPM project pages. Hardware support Both the i386 (32-bit x86) and x86-64 releases of Ubuntu are supported by Wubi and Lubi. In versions before 8.04, only the x86 release of Ubuntu was supported. Origins A number of Linux distributions, including Red Hat Linux and Slackware's ZipSlack, provided a similar tool in the mid-1990s, using syslinux and the UMSDOS filesystem driver. Later, SuSE provided something similar using syslinux and loop-mounted disk images on FAT filesystems. During the late '90s BeOS used a similar system to install the OS in a folder in Windows. The idea for Wubi was drafted by Agostino Russo taking inspiration from Topologilinux, which provided a loopmounted installation, and Instlux, that provided a simple Windows frontend. The idea was to merge the two concepts having a Windows installer that would loopmount an image of Ubuntu. Geza Kovacs later refined the specification and provided the first prototypes to show that the concept was sound. Oliver Mattos wrote the original user interface in NSIS. Agostino Russo then refined the loop- installation concept, moving from a simple loopmounted pre-made image file to an image created on the fly using a dynamically patched version of the Debian installer, thus providing an experience which was closer to a real installation while addressing several other issues of the early prototypes. Lupin project was thus born and Agostino Russo wrote and implemented most of its code with some contributions from Geza Kovacs. Agostino Russo and Ecology2007 later redesigned and rewrote the current Windows front-end. Hampus Wessman contributed the new downloader and the translation scripts. Bean123 and Tinybit also helped to debug and fix bootloader issues. Lubi and LVPM were subsequently created by Geza Kovacs. The project has inspired the creation of other Windows-based Linux installers, such as Win32-loader.

History The church takes its name from the Latin word \\"Gallicantu\\", meaning cock's-crow. This is in commemoration of Peter's triple rejection of Jesus \\"... before the cock crows twice.\\" () A Byzantine shrine dedicated to Peter's repentance was erected on this spot in 457 AD, but was destroyed by the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1010. The chapel was rebuilt by Crusaders in 1102 and given its present name. After the fall of Jerusalem the church again fell into ruin and was not rebuilt until 1931. Today a golden rooster protrudes prominently from the sanctuary roof in honor of its biblical connection. This spot is also believed to be the location of the High Priest Caiaphas' palace. According to the Pilgrim of Bordeaux in his Itinerarium Burdigalense, \\"...going up from the Pool of Siloe to Mount Zion one would come across the House of the Priest Caiaphas.\\" Layout and Design The entrance to the church is from a parking lot located above the main level of the church. In the courtyard is a statue that depicts the events of the denial and include its main figures; the cock, the woman, and the Roman soldier. The inscription includes the biblical passage; But he denied him, saying \\"Woman, I know him not\\"! () The entrance itself is flanked by wrought iron doors covered with biblical bas reliefs. To the right are two Byzantine-era mosaics found during excavation, these were most likely part of the floor of the fifth- century shrine. The main sanctuary contains large, multi-colored mosaics portraying figures from the New Testament. Facing the entrance is a bound Jesus being questioned at Caiaphas' palace; on the right Jesus and the disciples are shown dining at the Last Supper; and on the left Peter, considered the first Pope, is pictured in ancient papal dress. Perhaps the most striking feature of the interior is the ceiling, which is dominated by a huge cross-shaped window designed in a variety of colors. The fourteen Stations of the Cross also line the walls and are marked with simple crosses. Beneath the upper church is a chapel which incorporates stone from ancient grottos inside its walls. Down a hole in the center of the sanctuary one can see caves that may have been part of the Byzantine shrine. These walls are engraved with crosses left by fifth-century Christians. On an even lower level there is a succession of caves from the Second Temple period. Since tradition places the palace of Caiaphas on this site, many believe that Jesus may have been imprisoned in one of these underground crypts after his arrest, however, these caves were normal in many Roman-era homes, and often served as cellars, water cisterns, and baths. On the north side of the church is an ancient staircase that leads down towards the Kidron Valley. This may have been a passage from the upper city to the lower city during the first temple period. Many Christians believe that Jesus followed this path down to Gethsemane the night of his arrest. The church belongs to the Assumptionist Fathers, a French order established in 1887 and named for Mary's Assumption into heaven. The Order has its headquarters in Jerusalem's monumental Hostelry of Our Lady of France, (Notre Dame de France), built in 1889.

Hussain Kuwajerwala and Juhi Parmar played the lead roles Sumit and Kumkum. It was produced under the company BAG films. Plot Summary The soap opera tells the tale of the Wadhwa family and its daughter-in-law, Kumkum. She is happily married to Jatin. However, he dies of a brain tumor while she is expecting their first child. The Wadhwas decide to get their young daughter- in-law remarried and find an eligible young man named Vishal. However, when obstacles arise leading and the marriage is called off on the last day, Jatin's younger brother Sumit impulsively marries Kumkum in order to save her from societal disgrace. Sumit is plagued by guilt for marrying Kumkum against her will,but She eventually falls in deep love with him while trying to expose Renuka (Sumit's ex girlfriend).The crux of the story evolves as a blossoming romance between Sumit and Kumkum leads them to realise that they are soulmates and how Kumkum being the ideal daughter-in-law of the Wadhwa family protects Sumit's family despite the adverse circumstances facing them. Manik (an impostor bearing Jatin's face) creates havoc in their lives, but Kumkum exposes his fake identity and unites with Sumit. Kumkum gives birth to Sharman and Aashka (Sumit and Kumkum's progeny). =20 Years Later= Sumit and Kumkum's story continues with their grown-up kids Dhruv, Sharman and Aashka and Kumkum's role of establishing harmony in the Wadhwa family. Dhruv's wife Antara plans an elaborate ruse to usurp the Wadhwa property and house to herself, but her plans are foiled after Sumit and Kumkum unveil her truth to Dhruv. Sharman who is in deep love with Neeti gets engaged to her, but when Dhruv refuses to accept Siya on the day of the wedding owing to his feelings for Antara, Sharman impulsively marries Siya. Siya is disappointed and vents her frustration at the Wadhwa family, but she eventually forgives Sharman and confesses her love for him and Sumit-Kumkum are finally happy to see the Wadhwa family happily settled. Unfortunately both Kumkum and Sumit die before they complete a ritual that would enable them to be soulmates by Pulkit (Kumkum's ex-stalker) who conspires to kill Sumit after trailing Kumkum secretly for several days. The shot misses Sumit, but Kumkum is shot dead and Sumit punishes Pulkit but still kills himself, unable to bear the separation. =20 Years Later, Sumit & Kumkum are Reincarnated= Sumit and Kumkum are reborn as prophesied again without any memory of their past life. In the new life Sumit and Kumkum initially hate each other, but fall in deep love all over again owing to unusual circumstances, prompting them to be a false husband and wife in front of their family members. When they finally realise their love for each other, they are separated due to a misunderstanding between the Raichand and Mishra families and later by a series of new obstacles but eventually reunite in the end. Sumit marries Kumkum and Harshvardhan and Rajeshwari Wadhwa accompany them to the sacred pilgrimage site where their lives ended in the previous birth.

Many affected people are cancer survivors who had treatment for cervical cancer or prostate cancer; it has also been termed pelvic radiation disease with radiation proctitis being one of the principal features.  Signs and symptoms  People who have been treated with radiotherapy for pelvic and other abdominal cancers frequently develop gastrointestinal symptoms. These include: * rectal bleeding * diarrhea and steatorrhea * other defecation disorders including fecal urgency and incontinence. * nutritional deficiencies and weight loss * abdominal pain and bloating * nausea, vomiting and fatigue Gastrointestinal symptoms are often found together with those in other systems including genitourinary disorders and sexual dysfunction. The burden of symptoms substantially impairs the patients' quality of life. Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and diarrhea may happen early during the course of radiotherapy. Radiation enteropathy represents the longer-term, chronic effects that may be found after a latent period most commonly of 6 months to 3 years after the end of treatment. In some cases, it does not become a problem for 20‚Äì30 years after successful curative therapy. =Associated conditions= * Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth * Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency * Bile acid diarrhea * Urinary urgency * Sexual dysfunction  Causes  A large number of people receive abdominal and or pelvic radiotherapy as part of their cancer treatment with 60‚Äì80% experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms. This is used in standard therapeutic regimens for cervical cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, anal cancer, lymphoma and other abdominal malignancies. Symptoms can be made worse by the effects of surgery, chemotherapy or other drugs given to treat the cancer. Improved methods of radiotherapy have reduced the exposure of non-involved tissues to radiation, concentrating the effects on the cancer. However, as the parts of the intestine such as the ileum and the rectum are immediately adjacent to the cancers, it is impossible to avoid some radiation effects. Previous intestinal surgery, obesity, diabetes, tobacco smoking and vascular disorders increase the chances of developing enteropathy.  Pathology  = Acute intestinal injury = Early radiation enteropathy is very common during or immediately after the course of radiotherapy. This involves cell death, mucosal inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction. This injury is termed mucositis and results in symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea and abdominal pain. It recovers within a few weeks or months. = Long-term effects of radiation = The delayed effects, found 3 months or more after radiation therapy, produce pathology which includes intestinal epithelial mucosal atrophy, vascular sclerosis, and progressive fibrosis of the intestinal wall, among other changes in intestinal neuroendocrine and immune cells and in the gut microbiota. These changes may produce dysmotility, strictures, malabsorption and bleeding. Problems in the terminal ileum and rectum predominate. Diagnosis Multiple disorders are found in patients with radiation enteropathy, so guidance including an algorithmic approach to their investigation has been developed. This includes a holistic assessment with investigations including upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, breath tests and other nutritional and gastrointestinal tests. Full investigation is important as many cancer survivors of radiation therapy develop other causes for their symptoms such as colonic polyps, diverticular disease or hemorrhoids.  Prevention  Prevention of radiation injury to the small bowel is a key aim of techniques such as brachytherapy, field size, multiple field arrangements, conformal radiotherapy techniques and intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Medications including ACE inhibitors, statins and probiotics have also been studied and reviewed.  Treatment  In people presenting with symptoms compatible with radiation enteropathy, the initial step is to identify what is responsible for causing the symptoms. Management is best with a multidisciplinary team including gastroenterologists, nurses, dietitians, surgeons and others. Medical treatments include the use of hyperbaric oxygen which has beneficial effects in radiation proctitis or anal damage. Nutritional therapies include treatments directed at specific malabsorptive disorders such as low fat diets and vitamin B12 or vitamin D supplements, together with bile acid sequestrants for bile acid diarrhea and possibly antibiotics for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Probiotics have all been suggested as another therapeutic avenue. Endoscopic therapies including argon plasma coagulation have been used for bleeding telangiectasia in radiation proctitis and at other intestinal sites, although there is a rick of perforation. Surgical treatment may be needed for intestinal obstruction, fistulae, or perforation, which can happen in more severe cases. These can be fatal if patients present as an emergency, but with improved radiotherapy techniques are now less common. A systematic review has found there is some promising evidence for non-surgical interventions for late rectal damage, however due to low quality evidence no conclusions could be drawn. Optimal treatment usually produces significant improvements in quality of life.  Prevalence  An increasing number of people are now surviving cancer, with improved treatments producing cure of the malignancy (cancer survivors). There are now over 14 million such people in the US, and this figure is expected to increase to 18 million by 2022. More than half are survivors of abdominal or pelvic cancers, with about 300,000 people receiving abdominal and pelvic radiation each year. It has been estimated there are 1.6 million people in the US with post-radiation intestinal dysfunction, a greater number than those with inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.  Research  New agents have been identified in animal studies that may have effects on intestinal radiation injury. The research approach in humans has been reviewed.

The castle dates to the fifteenth century (with part from the fourteenth) and was once connected to the church via a wooden bridge. A coat of arms of the Hautefort barony is visible. In a document dating from 1158 (the Cartulaire Cadouin) the name 'Abzacum' is mentioned for the first time, describing a farm dating back to the Gallo-Roman era. A Roman road linking Vesunna (P√©rigueux) and Lugdunum (Lyon) ran by or close to the town. In the Middle Ages, the name became 'Abzac', one of the oldest family names in P√©rigord. The town was on a secondary route for pilgrims following the Way of St. James to Santiago de Compostela, and a house dating to 1527 was a relay point. In the thirteenth century Ajat's church was occupied by the Knights Templar, before the order was disbanded. By the 16th century Ajat was under the control of the Hautefort barony, based in a town to the east.http://www.domainedesormeaux.com/pdf/Notice-sur-Ajat.pdf The Ajat commune has limestone woodland classified in the French system as being of special scientific interest (SSSI). The town has a public swimming pool in the summer months, and there is an occasional restaurant in the grounds of the castle. A small shop has now closed. Surrounding hamlets include Beauzens and Les Fouilloux, the latter consisting of only six dwellings. The commune of Beauzens joined Ajat in the late 1700s. The Church of St. Bartholomew in Beauzens (Eglise Saint-Barth√©lemy de Beauzens) dates to 1000, making it one of the oldest in the region. It has a Romanesque facade. Although the commune has seen little population increase, there is some new building and in recent years there has been some refurbishment of older properties for use as second homes and tourist stays.

On Long Island, the wing coordinated the delivery of the very long range Republic P-47N Thunderbolt from its manufacturing plant at Farmingdale, with aircraft being flown to North Carolina where two of the newly assigned groups of the 301st (413th and 414th) were training. The war in the Pacific required fighter ranges even greater than did operations over Germany, and the mission of the 301st Fighter Wing was to provide bomber escort for Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortress bombers during their strategic bombing missions over Japan in 1945. Soon after Saipan and Guam were taken with B-29 units being assigned there, the 318th Group formed on the Ryukyu Islands, consisting of six fighter groups, the 15th and 21st (being transferred from Seventh Air Force) and the 413th, 414th, 506th and 507th, all being deployed from the United States. Being the first wing to be equipped with the P-47N, the groups operated as a long-range escort for B-29 Superfortress bombers attacking the Japanese mainland all the way from Saipan to Japan and on many other long, overwater flights. In July 1945 the 301st was reassigned to the Eighth Air Force with the same mission for Eighth Air Force in the planned invasion of Japan. The atomic bombings of Japan led to the Japanese surrender before Eighth Air Force saw action in the Pacific theater. The wing was reassigned to Far East Air Forces when Eighth Air Force was returned to the United States in 1946. Its four wartime fighter groups returned to the United States early in 1946, being replaced by the 51st Fighter Group as its operational unit. It served as part of the Army of Occupation on Okinawa. The wing performed air defense role over the Ryukyu Islands. After 18 August 1948, the wing had no units assigned and existed as a paper unit until inactivated on 20 January 1949. =Cold War= MASDC on 13 November 1981. Today, the aircraft is waiting restoration at the Yanks Air Museum, Chino, California. Wing McDonnell F-4EAircraft is McDonnell Douglas F-4E-38-MC Phantom 68-366 about 1985. Upon its retirement in May 1990, this aircraft was first sent to Sheppard Air Force Base as a GF-4E ground maintenance trainer, then placed on static display at the Commemorative Air Force Museum at Midland, Texas as part of their Vietnam Memorial. The 301st was reactivated in July 1972 as the 301st Tactical Fighter Wing at Carswell AFB, Texas in the United States Air Force Reserve. Upon reactivation the wing was assigned the Republic F-105 \\"Thunderchief\\", with the Carswell-based 457th Fighter Squadron using specially modified version of the F-105D called the \\"Thunderstick II\\". The 301st Fighter Wing led the way for Air Force Reserve fighter units in deploying to overseas bases for NATO exercises when it deployed to Norvenich Air Base, Germany, in August 1977 and Gioia del Colle Air Base, Italy, in May 1979. In 1981, the wing converted to the McDonnell- Douglas F-4D Phantom II. Subsequent overseas deployments by the 301st Fighter Wing included Cigli Air Base, Turkey, in October 1982. A deployment to Sivrihisar Air Base, Turkey, in May 1985 was an AFRES first when they operated under bare base conditions. The unit also deployed to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station in Puerto Rico, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. In 1987 the unit began swapping to the newer F-4E Phantom II. During Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, many wing people were recalled to active duty and served at various locations throughout the United States, Germany, England, and Southwest Asia. In April 1991, the wing converted to the F-16C/D, \\"Fighting Falcon\\". = Post Cold War = In December 1993, the wing deployed six F-16s, (along with six from the 944th Fighter Wing at Luke AFB, Arizona), and approximately 350 wing people to Aviano Air Base, Italy, in support of United Nations Operation Deny Flight mission. Due to the wing converting from the F-4 to the F-16 fighter aircraft during Desert Shield/Storm, this voluntary deployment to Aviano AB was the first non-exercise operational aviation deployment since flying fighters out of Carswell in 1972. Due to achieving the highest rating possible from the May 1994 Operational Readiness Inspection and supporting the Deny Flight mission, the 301st Fighter Wing was awarded as an Air Force outstanding unit for the period May 1992 to May 1994. In May and June 1997, the wing deployed to Karup Air Base, Denmark. The wing joined forces with three U.S. Air Force units and foreign air forces in two separate exercises while in Denmark. The first was the command and control Exercise Central Enterprise. The second exercise was called BALTOPS (Baltic Operations). In May 1998, the wing deployed with six Air Force Reserve aircraft to fly Operation Southern Watch sorties from Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait. =Global War on Terrorism= Elements of the 301st Fighter Wing deployed in October 2001 to the Middle East as part of a regularly scheduled aerospace expeditionary force rotation to enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. While there, the reservists also began flying combat missions as part of Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF) over Afghanistan. Throughout the 90-day deployment, the reservists flew between nine and 15 hours a day. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign Hill AFB. It would distribute nine of the 419th Fighter Wing F-16s to the 301st Fighter Wing. In 2007 the wing gained another eight aircraft from the 192d Fighter Wing of the Virginia Air National Guard bringing its total to 32 airplanes.

Its total area is about , comprising about one-third of Russia's total area. Formally, the regions of the Extreme North comprise the whole of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Kamchatka Krai, Magadan Oblast, Murmansk Oblast and Sakha, as well as certain parts and cities of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Irkutsk Oblast, Khabarovsk Krai, Komi Republic, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Republic of Karelia, Sakhalin Oblast, Tuva, Tyumen Oblast, as well as all islands of the Arctic Ocean, its seas, the Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk. Due to the harsh conditions of the area, people who work there have traditionally been entitled by the Russian government to higher wages than workers of other regions. As a result of the climate and environment, the indigenous peoples of the area have developed certain genetic differences that allow them to better cope with the region's environment, as do their cultures. Yakutia Largest cities Yakutsk (pop. 322,987), Murmansk (287,847), Severodvinsk (181,990), Norilsk (181,830), Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (179,586), Novy Urengoi (118,033), Noyabrsk (106,911), and Magadan (92,052) are the largest cities within the Russian Far North proper. The larger and more southern Surgut (380,632) is the largest among cities and territories \\"equated\\" to the Far North. Legal status The Far North is known for its extremely harsh climate. People who work there, other than indigenous populations involved in traditional occupations and inmates of labor camps (e.g., the gulags of the Soviet Union), receive an extra grade of payment, referred to as the \\"Northern Bonus\\" (severnye nadbavki ). Additional benefits include extra vacation, extra disability benefits, extra retirement benefits (a lower retirement age), and housing benefits, in compensation for the difficult working conditions. Such compensation began under the Soviet Union and has been maintained by the Russian Federation. In January 2007, the State Duma Committee for Issues of the North and Far East approved a proposed law defining regions within the Far North that would determine the extent of compensation for workers. The regions were established based on general climate, with harsher regions garnering greater compensation relative to milder regions.

Opening in 1905, Terminal Station served Southern Railway, Seaboard Air Line, Central of Georgia (including the Nancy Hanks to Savannah), and the Atlanta and West Point. The architect was P. Thornton Marye, whose firm also designed the Fox Theater and Capital City Club in downtown Atlanta, as well as the Birmingham Terminal Station. At the station's opening in 1905 the military band of the 16th Infantry Regiment played \\"Down in Dixie\\" according to a report that appeared in the Atlanta Journal. On May 21, 1910, a statue of Samuel Spencer, who had served as the first president of Southern Railway, was dedicated at the station, where it would remain until the station's closing. In its 20th century heyday, Terminal Station was used by such well-known trains of the time as the Crescent, Man 'o War, Nancy Hanks, Ponce de Leon, and Silver Comet. A veritable rail-travel crossroads of the American south-east, it was a critical railroad link between the warm climate of Florida and the Gulf Coast, and the rather colder, more densely populated states of the north-east and mid-west. For many residents of the Northeast, Terminal Station was the gateway to the sunshine. The Atlanta Convention Bureau released a postcard in the 1920s that claimed that Terminal Station was served by 86 trains per day. The train shed that had originally been built alongside the head house was torn down in 1925. The Southern Railway built an office building next door to the station at 99 Spring Street that is still standing, although the Southern eventually moved their local offices to another building in Atlanta. On 17 May 1938 a five-story Terminal Hotel, that had been built across the street from Terminal Station, burned in a disaster that claimed 27 lives. Terminal Station showing its shortened towers, c. 1949 The station head house was renovated in 1947 just after World War II. After Terminal Station closed in June 1970, Southern continued to operate its Southern Crescent and Piedmont passenger trains using the much smaller Peachtree Station, commonly known as Brookwood Station and built as a suburban station, as their only stop in Atlanta. The only other passenger train remaining at that time that had been using Terminal Station, the Nancy Hanks, used a makeshift ticket office and waiting room in the Southern office building next door. Terminal Station was razed in 1972, although Southern retained one platform for its use. The site of Terminal Station is now the Richard B. Russell Federal Building which was built in 1979. The aforementioned platform and a portion of lead trackage are all that remain of the station. The interlocking switch tower was removed in June 2018.

Such filmmakers as Quentin Tarantino, Charlie Kaufman and Steven Soderbergh have found more creative freedom by working in this area.  Background  Throughout the middle of the 1990s the word 'Indiewood' was invented to describe a component of the spectrum of American films in which distinctions exist, it seemed as if Hollywood and the independent sector had become blurred. Indiewood Divisions gain from expert experience of the niche industry by hiring leading independent personalities such as Harvey Weinstein from the Disney fold after the exit of the Weinsteins, and James Schamus, former joint head of Good Machine, at Focus Features. Differences from Hollywood The films are often made for far less money than Hollywood films, and each aspect of the filmmaking process has to undergo less scrutiny by committees. Additionally, with the in Indiewood approach the filmmaker can take as long as they need in the post-production phase of their film - whereas in Hollywood they are contracted to finish the film in a specific period of time (usually 10 weeks). In Hollywood, the film then goes on to show in focus group screenings on the studio lot. In Indiewood, the filmmakers can determine the next steps of the film. Most Indiewood films are first shown at film festivals with the hopes of further distribution by being picked up (or purchased) by a larger film company or distributor. Simultaneously, many Hollywood films do not make it past the focus groups and subsequent distribution because the scripts are often ruined by being over-thought and \\"over-written\\" by the executive committees & focus groups. Hollywood films are usually made for the lowest common denominator audience while Indiewood films are able to be released with a more singular vision of the film director (ideally). In an issue devoted to digital filmmaking and technologies, Scientific American Magazine printed diagrams by director Tara Veneruso demonstrating the difference between Indiewood and Hollywood from pre-production through distribution. The diagrams include the theatrical move to satellite rather than film prints.

Harris and starring Wesley Snipes, Dennis Hopper, Lolita Davidovich, and Viggo Mortensen. The film was released in the United States on April 16, 1993. It was James B. Harris' last film. It is based on the novel Money Men by former U.S. Secret Service agent Gerald Petievich, who co-wrote the screenplay. Plot This film opens with Treasury officer Jimmy Mercer (Wesley Snipes) and his partner Brady (Dan Hedaya) doing some undercover work, when Mercer's fellow agent is shot and killed by a new man, Ronnie (Viggo Mortensen) that criminal Red Diamond (Dennis Hopper) pulled out of jail. Now on a snap of anger and thoughts of revenge, Mercer wants to find the killer and take him down before he gets transferred to Newark. Although a cop and close colleague claims over dinner that Mercer must do it \\"by the book,\\" Mercer replies that \\"when I'm done with this motherfucker, I'm gonna put him in a box..... by the book.\\" A background theme is the closing of a big band dance emporium called the Palace. Lonely, Red takes hooker Vicky (Lolita Davidovich) there for dancing. Lolita is also involved romantically with Mercer, who is estranged from his ex-wife. Red continues to try to build a relationship with his old girlfriend, waitress Mona, (Valerie Perrine). Typically, he has manipulated and betrayed her in the past. Red is under increasing pressure to repay mob debts to boss Tony Dio (Tony Lo Bianco). He manipulates Ronnie into a crime spree culminating in the murder of the boss and ransacking his apartment. He tells Ronnie to meet him at the palace at 9 PM to split up the money. He asks Mona to meet him there as well. Mercer is building his case against Red and arrives at the murder scene seconds too late. Red is soon arrested and a net is laid for Ronnie at the club At the club Red again manipulates Ronnie in an attempt to escape, yelling gun as he ducks. Ronnie is shot by Mercer in the exchange and Red almost escapes. As Red is taken away in the police car Mona arrives, seeing him pass by. In the last scene Jimmy asks Vicky to leave with him. The epilogue reports that they actually did move to Newark.

Career  Dallat joined the Social Democratic and Labour Party and was elected to Coleraine Borough Council in 1977. From 2001‚Äì02, he was the first Irish nationalist Mayor of Coleraine. In 1996 he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Northern Ireland Forum election in East Londonderry.Northern Ireland elections Dallat was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for East Londonderry in 1998 and held his seat in 2003. At the 2001 and 2005 UK general elections, he unsuccessfully contested the Westminster seat of East Londonderry. He had been vocal in his opposition of the Coleraine loyalist who was convicted of the Greysteel massacre, Torrens Knight, being released from prison. Knight who was freed under the terms of the Good Friday agreement. On 14 September 2010, he shared a debate with the NF publicity officer, Tom Linden, on BBC Radio Foyle about the support for the NF in Coleraine. Dallat expressed his disgust and was then criticised by Linden for being a member of a sectarian party, which allowed Dallat to air his views, which resulted in the NF Coleraine organiser, Mark Brown, \\"thanking\\" Dallat for helping the NF double its support in Coleraine through enquiries and membership. A member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, Dallat commented that Conor Murphy had scheduled the 2016 opening of the Dungiven by-pass to coincide with the centenary of the Easter Rising, to which Sinn F√©in councillor Paddy Butcher said: \\"Attacking Sinn F√©in minister Conor Murphy, Mr. Dallat cautioned the residents of Dungiven to 'hope the Dungiven bypass is less of an aspiration and more something they (Sinn F√©in) are actually capable of delivering'\\". After a short retirement, Dallat retained the SDLP seat in East Londonderry in the 2017 Assembly elections.  Death  Dallat died on 5 May 2020 at the age of 73.

In humans, the CD146 protein is encoded by the MCAM gene.  Function  MCAM functions as a receptor for laminin alpha 4, a matrix molecule that is broadly expressed within the vascular wall. Accordingly, MCAM is highly expressed by cells that are components of the blood vessel wall, including vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and pericytes. Its function is still poorly understood, but evidence points to it being part of the endothelial junction associated with the actin cytoskeleton. A member of the Immunoglobulin superfamily, it consists of five Ig domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region. It is expressed on chicken embryonic spleen and thymus, activated human T cells, endothelial progenitors such as angioblasts and mesenchymal stem cells, and strongly expressed on blood vessel endothelium and smooth muscle. Two isoforms exist (MCAM long (MCAM-1), and MCAM short, or MCAM-s) which differ in the length of their cytoplasmic domain. Activation of these isoforms seems to produce functional differences as well. Natural killer cells transfected with MCAM-1 demonstrate decreased rolling velocity and increased cell adhesion to an endothelial cell monolayer and increased microvilli formation while cells transfected with MCAM-s showed no change in adhesion characteristics. Since these characteristics are important in leukocyte extravasation, MCAM-1 may be an important part of the inflammatory response. CD146 has been demonstrated to appear on a small subset of T and B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. The CD146+ T cells display an immunophenotype consistent with effector memory cells and have a distinct gene profile from the CD146- T cells. CD146 T cells have been shown by Dagur and colleagues to produce IL-17. CD146 has been seen as a marker for mesenchymal stem cells isolated from multiple adult and fetal organs, and its expression may be linked to multipotency; mesenchymal stem cells with greater differentiation potential express higher levels of CD146 on the cell surface.  Relevance in cancer  MCAM inhibits breast cancer progression. Normal melanocytes do not express MCAM and the expression of MCAM is first found in nevi and melanoma cells. MCAM expression is positively correlated to melanoma progression at which the expression of MCAM is highest in metastatic melanoma cells. The significance of MCAM upregulation is evident in melanoma cells cultured in 3D skin reconstruct in which MCAM facilitates the migration of melanoma into the dermis. Without the expression of MCAM melanoma cells are controlled by keratinocytes in the epidermis that inhibit penetrance beyond the basement membrane. The control by keratinocytes are only achieved by E-cadherin expression on the surface of melanoma cells. Melanoma cells with functional E-cadherin on the surface can only exclusively grow in the epidermis as keratinocytes frequently downregulate the expression of MCAM on melanoma cells.

It is a mostly green parrot with black band on the back of its neck, and a dark greyish-black bill. Both sexes are similar. It is rarely kept in captivity because of its dietary requirement for a native fig. Description It is a mostly green parrot with black-collared nape, brownish red chest, greyish black bill, yellow iris and grey feet. Both sexes are similar. Taxonomy There are three subspecies of the black-collared lovebird: * The nominate subspecies, A. s. swindernianus - Liberia, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana * Cameroon black-collared lovebird, A. s. zenkeri - Cameroon, Gabon and Congo * Ituri black-collared lovebird or Emin's lovebird, A. s. emini - Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. The black-collared lovebird was discovered by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. The name commemorates the Dutch professor, Theodore van Swinderen of University of Groningen. Distribution and habitat The black-collared lovebird is distributed across a wide range in equatorial Africa. It inhabits the forests of Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Liberia and Uganda. They hide high in the forest canopy and are characterized as being very shy. Status It is rare in some parts of its range. The range is so large that the population is difficult to estimate, but it is believed that the population is not under significant threat. The black-collared lovebird is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Aviculture Black-collared lovebirds are rarely kept in captivity or as pets. They require certain native fig seed or fig flesh as a basis of their daily diet, and without these vital dietary necessities they do not normally thrive or breed well in captivity.

The most common cause of normal anion gap acidosis is diarrhea with a renal tubular acidosis being a distant second. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of normal anion gap acidosis is relatively short (when compared to the differential diagnosis of acidosis): *Hyperalimentation (e.g. from TPN containing ammonium chloride) *Acetazolamide and other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors *Renal tubular acidosis *Diarrhea: due to a loss of bicarbonate. This is compensated by an increase in chloride concentration, thus leading to a normal anion gap, or hyperchloremic, metabolic acidosis. The pathophysiology of increased chloride concentration is the following: fluid secreted into the gut lumen contains higher amounts of Na+ than Cl‚àí; large losses of these fluids, particularly if volume is replaced with fluids containing equal amounts of Na+ and Cl‚àí, results in a decrease in the plasma Na+ concentration relative to the Cl‚àíconcentration.

The tribunal was in operation between 1985 and 1 January 2008. Background In 1981 the New South Wales Government passed legislation which vested all unmined coal to the crown. The effect of Coal Acquisition Act 1981 (NSW) was that the government became the owner of all unmined coal in the state. Vesting of the ownership of the coal enabled the government to tax the mining of coal, a situation it was not allowed to do when coal was privately owned. According to the New South Wales Coal Compensation Board‚Äôs annual report, the net benefit to the State from the acquisition of private coal is estimated at around $10 billion after taking into account compensation payments totalling $682 million The board and the tribunal were established in 1985 to address concerns by former coal owners through the introduction of the Act. Both bodies were the result of recommendations of the Coal Compensation Taskforce Report. Constitution The tribunal was established under the Coal Acquisition (Compensation) Arrangements 1985 (NSW). Those arrangements were made by the Governor of New South Wales under the Coal Acquisition Act 1981 (NSW), a law which entitles the governor to determine what compensation should be payable for the acquisition of coal in 1981. The tribunal consisted of six members appointed by the Governor. Two of those members were lawyers nominated by the Attorney General of New South Wales. The remaining four members were nominated by the Minister for Mineral Resources and were generally persons who have expertise in the coal industry. The Governor may appoint one of the lawyer members as the chairperson and the other as deputy chairperson. There was also provision for the Governor to appoint alternates for the members. Jurisdiction The tribunal had jurisdiction to decide whether the compensation determined as payable by the board as a result of the compulsory acquisition of coal is correct. It may also determine the amount of compensation payable as a result of that acquisition. The tribunal sat as a three-member panel with either the chairperson or deputy presiding. The chairperson immediately prior to the Tribunal's abolition was Mr G. R. Leader. Caseload According to the tribunal's 2005 Annual Report, it determined 67 appeals in 2004 and had 26 outstanding. The New South Wales Government flagged that it wished for all compensation claims to be determined by March 2007 and the tribunal will cease once all those claims have been finalised. Appeals There were no appeal rights from the decision of the tribunal. In certain cases, prerogative relief may be available from the Supreme Court of New South Wales, such as NSW Coal Compensation Board v Nardell Colliery Pty Ltd. Location Up until its abolition in 2008, the tribunal had its office at Level 16, No. 1 Castlereagh Street, Sydney.

The program continues to air on an irregular basis on weekend afternoons, especially during the late spring and summer months. Normally it airs pre- recorded \\"time-buy\\" sports events produced by outside companies, such as supercross or skiing competitions, or sponsored documentaries. Hosts Hosts of the program have included John \\"Bud\\" Palmer, Jack Whitaker, Brent Musburger, Pat Summerall, Jim Kelly, Dick Stockton, Tim Brant, John Tesh, Greg Gumbel, Pat O'Brien, Andrea Joyce, and Michele Tafoya.

In 1994, CBS had a new series of boxing bouts on Saturday or Sundays under the Eye on Sports banner. Tim Ryan (blow-by-blow) and Gil Clancy (color) were the commentators during this period. CBS continued airing boxing on a somewhat regular basis until 1998, by which time they had the NFL (after acquiring the American Football Conference package from NBC) and college football back on their slate.

In the 1850s and 1860s, with the advent of accurate timing devices and precisely measured running courses, the sport of running, called \\"pedestrianism,\\" became extremely popular, especially in Britain. On 19 August 1865, the greatest field of milers ever assembled to that time raced at the Royal Oak Grounds in Manchester for the Mile Championship Cup, ¬£30, and title of \\"Champion Miler of the World.\\" Included in the field of nine professionals were Siah Albison, who had set a mile record at the same location in 1860 at 4:22¬º, Lang who had broken Albison's record in 1863, and Edward Mills, the current record holder in the event at 4:20, set on 25 June 1864 also at Manchester. Lang was nicknamed the \\"Crowcatcher\\" and had set records in the two mile and six mile events in 1863. He had also run the mile in 4:21¬æ that year and was eager to win this race. A crowd of 15,000 watched the race, which also included Scot Robert McInstray, world-record holder in the 880-yard race, 4:21¬Ω miler James Sanderson, the Welsh mile champion William Richards and half-miler rabbit James Nuttall. As bets were being placed, word came through that Mills was limping and would not be able to compete, meaning that Lang was now the clear favourite. Nuttall led the field around the 651-yard track and hit the quarter-mile mark in 60 seconds, an unsustainable pace. The crowd cheered, and excitement built as Nuttall hit the half in 2:05¬Ω. Nuttall started to fade, and Lang took over the lead and at the 3/4 mile point with a time of 3:14, which the crowd realized was fast enough to make this the first-ever mile run under 4:20. As Lang headed into the backstretch, he tried to pull away, but McInstray kept pace as did the previously unheralded Richards. Albion had faded badly and was no longer a factor. As the three came onto the homestretch, the crowd roared, and McInstray lost ground. Richards, on the other hand, gained on Lang. At the finish, Richards pulled even and he and Lang crossed the line together. Though Lang's supporters howled with rage, the judges ruled the race a tie.

Continuation school The first secondary education in Elmira was a \\"continuation school\\" that began in 1896. Classes were held in one room in a public school and continued for only a short time. Education until that point in Elmira stopped at grade eight. Interest declined in the classes and higher education stopped for a period of time. In 1908, another attempt was made to again begin classes for a continuation group, but again stopped shortly after in December 1910. Three years later the trustees were asked to try again. On September 6, 1914, under the principalship of Alma Crawforth of Whitby, Ontario, the continuation school started once more. It resided in an unoccupied class in Riverside Public School. The second year a second teacher, Margaret MacDonald was added due to the success of the programme. Transportation to the school for some was by train. The first graduating class was in June 1917. Twelve students passed the middle school or grade 12 examinations. It was written that the cost of maintenance per pupil in 1928 was $50 per year. Building the new high school On January 6, 1924 the High School Board made a motion that the option held on the , 21 town lots, be accepted. Six days later the declaration of the purchase was made. Apparently, this land was owned by a Mr. Edward Beir. Later it was revealed that not three, but were actually purchased for the school site. It is not clear whether someone like F. W. Warren, the architect, Oscar Wiles, the contractor or some other citizen made a motion to obtain another . This piece of property was a section originally purchased by Mr. Edward Bristow in 1832. It was a solid timber forest. Mr. Bristow originally paid one dollar an acre to Mr. David Musselman. Mr. Bristow was the first settler and henceforth Elmira's former name of Bristow's Corners acknowledged this. The funds for the purchase of the land were handed to the board by the town council in May. The Public School Board provided an additional room in order to meet the demand for more space which would be needed when the school would be opened. Before the sod was turned in June 1938, fourteen years had passed since the original land purchase. This delay can be attributed to many factors. The war boom showed signs of recession and the Board became cautious. Initial pressure from the Education Department became less insistent. Accommodations at the present High School (Continuation School) were being met. The first chairman of the first official High School Board, George Klinck, turned the sod on June 28, 1938 for the new school. R.H. Vice, present chairman of the School Board laid the cornerstone, July 21, 1938. The original cost of the school was approximately $188,080. According to the book \\"The Development and Progress of Education in Elmira and Vicinity\\" George Klinck describes the school in the following manner: \\"It's distinguished, classical and dignified appearance, its favourable position which admits plenty of room on all sides, its solidity and durability, its freedom from questionable and perishable decorations, and its unresistable attractiveness\\" added to the outstanding features of the school. The school grounds as described by the same author state\\" of rich clay loam, about of which is reserved for experimental instruction purposes. The remainder will be used for play and recreation plots. The trustees have, wisely, consulted a professional landscape artist who has submitted a plan. There will be planted a variety of fruit, shade and forest trees, shrubs and flowers in accordance with the artist's plans, as soon as the season opens. The gym was regarded as 'one of the most attractive rooms in the school.' It provided the community with one more possible venue for civic gatherings. The general shop was seen to be a remarkable addition to the school. Klinck states that it \\"will be enthusiastically welcomed by the boys who are gifted with mechanical and utilitarian proclivities Combinations of practicability with academic education is the ideal goal for the ambitions of a practical matter of fact community. Parents should realize this and give their boys and girls a chance.\\" The school was officially opened on December 8, 1938 by the Hon. Dr. Simpson, Minister of Education. School crest EDSS Early days Some of the courses taught were General Academics, Junior Matriculation, Upper School in French, Latin and German, English History, Biology, Mathematics, Commercial Course, General Shop and Mechanics, Farm Mechanics, Woodworking, Sheet Metal, and Machine Drafting. The principal was R.R. Mansz. The teachers were Mr. E.W. Kendall, Miss E. Cruickshanks, Miss D. Legree, Miss L.M. Bell, and Miss C. McDonagh. Post-war In his booklet The Development of Secondary Education in the Elmira District, former principal H. B. Disbrowe writes: \\"it was soon after the end of the war that demand for equality of educational opportunity led to the establishment of the first enlarged high school districts.\\" In 1947 there were lengthy negotiations between the councils of the town of Elmira and the townships of Woolwich, Wellesley, and Peel. As a result of these talks it was agreed to dissolve the old Elmira High School Board and establish a new Elmira District High School Board. The new board assumed office in January 1948 and the school became known by a new name, \\"Elmira District High School.\\" In 1948, classes were considered to be large. A typical grade 9 class had 41 pupils and a grade 13 class had 40 pupils. Discipline was tight and was expected and respected by parents. The school song was \\"EHS Is Supreme Throughout The Land!\\" School colours were blue and white, and for gym students wore navy tunics with white blouses, socks and gym shoes \\"without fail\\" or they lost valuable marks for being late in the gym and being improperly attired. The school team was the Blue Bombers. Around 1950, the school colours were changed to green and gray. Students made their own green corduroy shorts in Home Economics and bought gray shiny T-shirts with green trim. In the early 1950s a social event for the school was Teen Town. Young ladies wore Gibson girl blouses (white) with black kerchiefs tied under the collar to make a bow at the front, and black gored skirts with crinoline slips holding them out; and ankle socks and saddle shoes. In 1954 at a cost of $149,990. a four-room addition was constructed. At this point there were 275 students in attendance. The architect for this project was R.C. Reider of Kitchener. Wunder Construction of Kitchener was granted the tender for $136,848. After miscellaneous expenses were added on, the total came $18.00 short of the limit the board would spend of $158,800. In 1959, ten to twelve rooms and another gymnasium were added due to growth in enrollment. (the number of rooms varies with different written accounts.) This last addition contained a laboratory, classrooms and a lady teacher's room. The new gym would be used by the boys and the older gym by the girls. The basement also included a new industrial arts classroom. The cost of this addition was $488,008 and gave an 85% increase in space. 1960s The new addition was officially opened at the end of April 1960 by Dr. S.D. Rendall, Superintendent of Secondary Education for Ontario. In his speech to nearly 900, Rendall said that nearly 60 out of every 100 students who got to high school never graduate. Cadet inspection was a major event in the early 1960s. Everyone male and female, unless he/she had a religious exemption or was in Grade 13, was required to participate. The guys wore wool uniforms and the girls wore blazers. The cadets marched down Snyder Avenue, along Church Street, and back up Arthur Street before inspection. Participants got off classes to practice and after inspection, the evening ended up being quite a big event with a dance at the end. Teen Town was a regular event and well attended. Ernie Kendall was the sponsor and kept things on the \\"up and up.\\" (Some will remember the year that Ernie tried to limit the close dancing by going out on the floor with a ruler to measure the distance between heads.[how far apart were they supposed to be?]) In 1963, a vocational wing was added on. This addition was perceived by the board as a move that was long overdue. It felt that the courses that were offered at that time were mainly geared 10 help prepare students for university entrance. These new programmes that would be available would better prepare a student with marketable skills for the job force. At that point in Canadian history, the market for unskilled labourers was rapidly diminishing due to automation in industry and its rapid growth. Valued at approximately $480,080. the new addition provided additional extensions to the existing facilities, an agricultural greenhouse, an electrical or carpentry shop, a drafting room, an automotive shop, a machine shop, and three classrooms. The entire addition and equipment were covered by a full grant with the Federal Government providing 75% and the Provincial Government 25%. The name of the school was changed to Elmira District Secondary School at the opening on January 17 and 18, 1963. Minister of Labor Charles Starr and O. W. (Mike) Weichel M.P. for Waterloo North were invited as guests of honour. The school curriculum now included Arts and Science, Business and Commerce, and Science, Technology and Trades. Within each branch there were five year courses and four year courses. In addition there were also occupational courses for boys and girls who only have one or two years to spend at school. The new Technical wing was the most up- to-date building of its kind in Ontario. It contained a Technical Director's office, Drafting Room, Machine Shop, Electrical Shop, Automotive Shop, Diversified Trades Shop, Greenhouse, Industrial Sewing Room, Nursing Room, Business Machines Room, Typing Room and Classrooms. H.B. Disbrowe, principal, felt that the changes in the secondary school programme, which were being implemented in Elmira, were the most sweeping to occur in Ontario. All this has sprung forth from a continuation school which started in 1896. Many people contributed to the education in Elmira. As George Klinck wrote, \\"Suffice it to state that the school stands as a tribute to the dutifulness and enterprise of the citizens of the town, to the ability of the architect and to the skill of the contractors and their helpers. May it long stand.\\" 2000s In 2006, the school began to remove asbestos from the walls and ceilings of the school, and added an elevator - luckily - apparently, the old part of the school was built on dirt, with no foundation beneath, so before the elevator was installed by Delta Elevators, a foundation was poured. The construction is finally over and the artworks are going back up on the walls. Another new piece of information is that the school has bought a piece of land across the street, formerly the Elmira Raceway, and now has a new sports field including a new track and field facility. There is also a large scoreboard at the new field. =Principals= *A. Mansz (1939‚Äì1940) *G. Currie (1940‚Äì1945) *H. Disbrowe (1945‚Äì1965) *M. Duke (1965‚Äì1973) *R. Milliken (1973‚Äì1981) *I.

Remote areas of northern Burma were for many years controlled by an army of Kuomintang (KMT) forces after the Communist victory in China in 1949. Burma accepted foreign assistance in rebuilding the country in these early years, but continued American support for the Chinese Nationalist military presence in Burma finally resulted in the country rejecting most foreign aid, refusing to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and supporting the Bandung Conference of 1955. Burma generally strove to be impartial in world affairs and was one of the first countries in the world to recognise Israel and the People's Republic of China. By 1958, the country was largely beginning to recover economically, but was beginning to fall apart politically due to a split in the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) into two factions, one led by Thakins Nu and Tin, the other by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein. This was despite the unexpected success of U Nu's 'Arms for Democracy' offer taken up by U Seinda in the Arakan, the Pa'O, some Mon and Shan groups, but more significantly by the PVO surrendering their arms. The situation became very unstable in parliament, with U Nu surviving a no-confidence vote only with the support of the opposition National United Front (NUF), believed to have 'cryptocommunists' amongst them. Army hardliners now saw the 'threat' of the CPB coming to an agreement with U Nu through the NUF, and in the end U Nu 'invited' Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over the country. Over 400 'communist sympathisers' were arrested, of which 153 were deported to the Coco Islands in the Andaman Sea. Among them was the NUF leader Aung Than, older brother of Aung San. The Botataung, Kyemon and Rangoon Daily were also closed down. Ne Win's caretaker government successfully stabilised the situation and paved the way for new general elections in 1960 that returned U Nu's Union Party with a large majority. The situation did not remain stable for long, when the Shan Federal Movement, started by Nyaung Shwe Sawbwa Sao Shwe Thaik (the first President of independent Burma 1948-52) and aspiring to a 'loose' federation, was seen as a separatist movement insisting on the government honouring the right to secession in 10 years provided for by the 1947 Constitution. Ne Win had already succeeded in stripping the Shan Sawbwas of their feudal powers in exchange for comfortable pensions for life in 1959. He staged the 1962 coup d'√©tat on 2 March 1962, arrested U Nu, Sao Shwe Thaik and several others, and declared a 'socialist state' run by a 'Union Revolutionary Council' of senior military officers. Sao Shwe Thaik's son, Sao Mye Thaik, was shot dead in what was generally described as a 'bloodless' coup. Thibaw Sawbwa Sao Kya Seng also disappeared mysteriously after being stopped at a checkpoint near Taunggyi.

The aircraft overran the runway, crashed into a rice field and burst into flames while landing at Adisutjipto International Airport on 7 March 2007. Twenty passengers and one crew member were killed. Both the captain and the first officer survived, but then were fired shortly after the accident occurred.  Background  =Aircraft= The aircraft was a Boeing 737-497,The aircraft was a Boeing 737-400 model; Boeing assigns a unique customer code for each company that buys one of its aircraft, which is applied as an infix in the model number at the time the aircraft is built, hence \\"737-497\\" registered as PK-GZC, which had been operated by other airlines before being acquired by Garuda Indonesia. The aircraft had accumulated over 35,200 airframe hours and 37,300 cycles since its first flight in 1992. = Crew = The captain and Pilot in Command (PIC) was 44-year-old Muhammad Marwoto Komar, who had been with Garuda Indonesia for more than 21 years. He had 13,421 flight hours, including 3,703 hours on the Boeing 737. The first officer was 30-year-old Gagam Saman Rohmana, who had been with the airline for three years and had 1,528 flight hours, with 1,353 of them on the Boeing 737. =Garuda Indonesia= The national airline of Indonesia (founded in 1949), Garuda Indonesia had received a number of criticisms in the months surrounding the crash. According to Australian aviation experts, Garuda Indonesia had one of the worst safety records among the world's national carriers. Since 1950, Garuda Indonesia has had 13 major accidents. The most recent was in 2002, when Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 ditched in the Bengawan Solo River due to engine flameout caused by excessive hail ingestion, killing a flight attendant. The deadliest accident was in 1997, when Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 flew into a wooded mountain on approach to Medan, killing 234 people. The managing director of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, Peter Harbison, stated that the major accidents in Indonesian aviation history were all caused by the combinations of airports' and fleets' low safety standards and the poor weather conditions in the area, including severe thunderstorms and other forms of inclement weather. Following the crash of Flight 200, the European Union banned Garuda and all Indonesian airlines from flying into the EU. The ban was a watershed moment for Garuda, leading to widespread reforms within the airline to improve both its safety and service standards. It led to the implementation of the 5-year Quantum Leap improvement program. Garuda's fleet was nearly doubled with the introduction of new aircraft such as the Boeing 737-800 and Boeing 777-300ER. Garuda also added more destinations by starting or resuming service to destinations such as Amsterdam and London. The European ban on Garuda was lifted in June 2009, two years after the crash, and the airline resumed service to Europe shortly afterwards with the inauguration of one-stop service from Jakarta to Amsterdam via Dubai. Flight chronology Flight GA200 originated in Jakarta and was carrying 133 passengers, 19 of whom were foreigners (10 Australians, 2 Americans, 5 Germans and 2 Koreans). Several Australian journalists were on the flight, covering the visit of Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer and Attorney-General Philip Ruddock to Java. They were on the flight as the aircraft carrying Australian dignitaries were at capacity. At 6:58am local time (UTC+7), the captain attempted to land at Adisutjipto International Airport in Yogyakarta, despite a faulty approach with excess speed and steep descent, and the resulting warnings of copilot and flight system. The aircraft touched down beyond the runway threshold at a speed of , faster than the normal landing speed. According to passengers, the aircraft shook violently before it crashed. The aircraft overran the end of the runway, went through the perimeter fence, was heavily damaged when it crossed a road, and stopped in a nearby rice field. A fuel-fed fire raged, which could not be reached by airport fire-suppression vehicles. While most passengers were able to escape, a number of passengers perished inside the burning fuselage. Captain Komar initially claimed that there was a sudden downdraft immediately before the flight landed, and that the flaps on the aircraft may have malfunctioned. Aftermath In a miraculous stroke of luck, one of the survivors was a freelance cameraman, Wayan Sukardo, for Channel Seven of Australia. He tumbled out of the cabin safely into a rice paddy, with his camera and, despite having a suspected broken leg and other injuries, started filming the aircraft burning up, along with shocked passengers evacuating, as well as injured passengers in the terminal of the airport, at one point also capturing a fuel tank blowing up accompanied by screams and violent shaking. He made a call to the Sydney headquarters a few minutes later, and the story was transmitted on the very same night. =Investigation= The accident was investigated by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC). Australian Federal Police disaster victim identification experts were deployed to the scene to assist with the identification of bodies. Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) staff assisted at the scene by inspecting the wreckage. The United States' National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) dispatched a team to assist in the investigation, including representatives from Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration. The flight recorders (flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder) were removed from the wreckage and flown to the ATSB's headquarters for further analysis using equipment not yet available in Indonesia. Staff in Australia could not extract data from the cockpit voice recorder, which was then sent to Boeing Renton Factory in Renton, Washington (United States) to be analysed. =Report of the NTSC= Extended flaps and spoilers of a landing Boeing 737 After the crew members were interviewed, the wreckage was examined, flight data and cockpit voice recordings were analyzed, and a safety review of the airport was conducted, Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee released its final report on 22 October 2007. No evidence was found of any defect or malfunction of the aircraft or its systems that could have contributed to the accident. Records showed only the right thrust reverser had been used for the previous 27 sectors, but a fault condition for the left reverser was reset by engineers before departure for this flight, and both were deployed during the landing roll. The weather was calm. It was noted that the Yogyakarta Airport did not conform to international safety standards, having a runway runoff in length, compared to the recommended length of . The key NTSC finding is that the aircraft was flown by the Pilot in Command (PIC) at an excessively steep descent and high airspeed ( rather than the normal during the approach and landing, resulting in unstable flight. The PIC's attention became fixated on trying to make the first approach work, and he failed to hear the warnings of the copilot and his recommendations to abort the landing and go around, and the repeated warnings from the aircraft flight systems, which were audible in the voice recorder data, e.g. \\"Sink rate\\" and \\"Whoop whoop, pull up\\". The copilot failed to take control of the aircraft in these extraordinary circumstances, as required by airline policy, apparently due to inadequate training. Wing flaps were not fully extended to the maximum 40¬∞, not even to the 15¬∞ repeatedly requested by the captain, but only to 5¬∞ because the first officer was aware that this was the recommended maximum for that high airspeed, but he failed to notify the captain. The touchdown, followed by two bounces, began beyond the nominal touchdown zone. The nose landing gear was severely damaged and broke apart during the following roll. The main engine thrust reversers were deployed 4 seconds after the touchdown, continued for 7 seconds, but were stowed 7 seconds before the aircraft left the end of the paved runway and ploughed through the airport perimeter fence. About beyond the end of the runway, the aircraft crossed a small ditch and adjacent road that is below the level of both the runway and the rice paddy on the far side. The nose of the aircraft impacted the roadside embankment and the engines impacted the concrete curb just before that embankment. The aircraft came to rest in the rice paddy field beyond the runway. It was severely damaged by the impact forces, leading to an intense, fuel-fed fire. Airport fire-control vehicles were unable to reach the crash site through the ruptured fence because of the slope and ditch between there and the road. The firemen were unable to deliver sufficient fire suppression foam on the burning aircraft because the hose that they dragged across the road became punctured by rescue vehicles and onlookers‚Äô vehicles driving over it and sharp objects such as the damaged fence. About 45 minutes after the crash, two city fire fighting vehicles arrived and were ordered by an un-qualified person to start hosing the fire with water. The fire was extinguished about 2 hours and 10 minutes after the crash. Coordination and procedures during the rescue were not in accordance with the Airport Emergency Plan (AEP) manual, and lacked coherence. In summary, the NTSC Report attributed the accident to pilot error. As of 1 March 2007, Garuda Indonesia had implemented a new fuel efficiency incentive, which awarded a salary bonus if fuel consumption for a flight was lower than nominal. During his interview with the NTSC, the captain denied that this had influenced his decision not to abort the landing. =Prosecution of the captain= On 4 February 2008, captain Komar was arrested and charged with six counts of manslaughter. The charge carried a penalty up to life imprisonment if the court found the crash was deliberate. Short of that finding, the lesser charge of negligent flying causing death carries a maximum sentence of seven years. The first officer testified that he had told the captain to go around because of excessive speed, and that he then had blacked out due to the severe buffeting. On 6 April 2009, the captain was found guilty of negligence and sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The captain's lawyers stated their intention to appeal on the basis that the Convention on International Civil Aviation, to which Indonesia is a party, stipulates that aviation accident investigation reports cannot be used to ascribe blame, but only to determine cause. The Garuda Pilots Association and Indonesian Pilots Federation threatened to strike in protest against the conviction. On 29 September 2009 the Indonesian High Court overturned the conviction, finding that the prosecutors had failed to prove that the pilot was ‚Äúofficially and convincingly guilty of a crime‚Äù. This case was later cited in a report published by the American Bar Association, in a defence of the principle that airline safety is undermined by such prosecutions because the threat of them taking place would impede the investigative processes. In popular culture The crash is featured in the Season 15 premiere of Mayday (Air Crash Investigations). The episode is titled \\"Fatal Focus\\".

The founding convention was held in Teplice from 30 August ‚Äì 3 September 1919; the first leader of the party was Josef Seliger. In the First Czechoslovak Republic, DSAP was the most important German party, aiming to give the German population a place in the republic. At first the party's leadership was politically and socially radical; the Czechoslovak State was regarded as a \\"creation of Allied Imperialism\\" and the Czechoslovak Constitution as the \\"suicide of democracy\\". However, these politics changed shortly thereafter as the radical left-wing, led by Karl Kreibich, left the party for the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in October 1920. The number of members fell dramatically from 1921‚Äì1926, from 120,000 to 60,000.≈†ebek 2000, 268. Unlike right-wing German parties, the DSAP accepted Jews as members, and nominated Jewish candidates for office. Some leading members of the party started talks with President Masaryk, who tried to persuade the party to join the government. It finally agreed in 1929, when its leader Ludwig Czech became Minister of Public Affairs. During the years of the great economic crisis, the party lost many of its Sudeten German supporters, and the Sudeten German Party (SdP) gained importance. After the Munich Agreement, when the troops of Nazi Germany began occupying the Sudeten areas (on 1 October 1938), only some of the anti-Nazi opposition members could retreat into the remaining Czechoslovakian territories. Immediately after the entry of the Nazi troops, the persecution of Social Democrats and other opponents of Nazism began. From October to December 1938, 20,000 members of the Social Democratic Party were arrested; 2,500 Sudeten Germans were sent to the Dachau concentration camp alone. Around 30,000 people managed to flee to the West. On 22 February 1939 the DSAP leadership decided to cease all activities in the Czechoslovak Republic and continue working abroad as \\"Treuegemeinschaft sudetendeutscher Sozialdemokraten\\".

He commanded the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division which was assigned to take Juno Beach during the D-Day invasion. Background Rod Keller entered the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, in the last years of the First World War. Upon graduating, he joined the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, one of the regiments of the Canadian Permanent Force. Like many other promising Canadian officers of that era, he attended Staff College, Camberley in England. War service When Canada went to war, Rod Keller was sent overseas as a brigade major. He rose to the command of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry in 1941 and was promoted Officer Commanding the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade a few months later. Keller was made a major-general and, between September 8, 1942, and August 8, 1944, he served as General Officer Commanding the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. Major-General Keller was popular with his troops, who appreciated his manners and outspoken language; however, a drinking problem and several breaches of security measures before D-Day cost him the support of both his superior officers and his own staff.Reid, Brian No Holding Back.

During the Battle for Caen, Keller handled Operation Windsor poorly, sending a reinforced brigade in to handle a divisional operation and delegating the planning to one of his brigadiers. Keller was also reportedly shell-shy by August, and rumours began to spread among the division that \\"Keller was yeller.\\"Granatstein, Jack. The Generals. Despite the continued complaints from above and below, Simonds, and General Harry Crerar, another of his admirers, refused to relieve him. Fate intervened when he was wounded by friendly fire on August 8. US bombers accidentally carpet bombed his divisional headquarters during Operation Totalize.

Lamin A/C belongs to the lamin family of proteins.  Function  Biogenesis of lamin A in normal cells and the failure to generate mature lamin A in Hutchinson‚ÄìGilford progeria syndrome. In the setting of ZMPSTE24 deficiency, the final step of lamin processing does not occur, resulting in an accumulation of farnesyl-prelamin A. In Hutchinson‚ÄìGilford progeria syndrome, a 50-amino acid deletion in prelamin A (amino acids 607‚Äì656) removes the site for the second endoproteolytic cleavage. Consequently, no mature lamin A is formed, and a farnesylated mutant prelamin A (progerin) accumulates in cells. The nuclear lamina consist of a two-dimensional matrix of proteins located next to the inner nuclear membrane. The lamin family of proteins make up the matrix and are highly conserved in evolution. During mitosis, the lamina matrix is reversibly disassembled as the lamin proteins are phosphorylated. Lamin proteins are thought to be involved in nuclear stability, chromatin structure and gene expression. Vertebrate lamins consist of two types, A and B. Through alternate splicing, this gene encodes three type A lamin isoforms. Early in mitosis, maturation promoting factor (abbreviated MPF, also called mitosis-promoting factor or M-phase-promoting factor) phosphorylates specific serine residues in all three nuclear lamins, causing depolymerization of the lamin intermediate filaments. The phosphorylated lamin B dimers remain associated with the nuclear membrane via their isoprenyl anchor. Lamin A is targeted to the nuclear membrane by an isoprenyl group but it is cleaved shortly after arriving at the membrane. It stays associated with the membrane through protein-protein interactions of itself and other membrane associated proteins, such as LAP1. Depolymerization of the nuclear lamins leads to disintegration of the nuclear envelope. Transfection experiments demonstrate that phosphorylation of human lamin A is required for lamin depolymerization, and thus for disassembly of the nuclear envelope, which normally occurs early in mitosis.  Clinical significance  salt bridge with glutamate 537 (magenta), but R527L substitution results in breaking this interaction (leucine is too short to reach glutamate). Models are presented in surface (upper) and in cartoon (lower) representation. Mutations in the LMNA gene are associated with several diseases, including Emery‚ÄìDreifuss muscular dystrophy, familial partial lipodystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease, and restrictive dermopathy. A truncated version of lamin A, commonly known as progerin, causes Hutchinson-Gilford-Progeria syndrome. To date over 1,400 SNPs are known . They can manifest in changes on mRNA, splicing or protein (e.g. Arg471Cys, Arg482Gln, Arg527Leu, Arg527Cys, Ala529Val ) level. DNA damage DNA double-strand damages can be repaired by either homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). LMNA promotes genetic stability by maintaining the levels of proteins that have key roles in HR and NHEJ. Mouse cells that are deficient for maturation of prelamin A have increased DNA damage and chromosome aberrations, and show increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In progeria, the inadequacy of DNA repair, due to defective LMNA, may cause features of premature aging (see DNA damage theory of aging).

His contribution to American art includes some of the foremost examples of action painting, produced consistently over the course of the second half of the 20th century. His art parallels the works of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Conrad Marca-Relli and others. He adapted the automatic techniques of the Surrealists and transformed it into his own kind of gesture painting. Biography Vincent Pepi studied at Cooper Union and Pratt Institute. He traveled to Africa and Mexico. In 1949 he went to Rome, Italy. This was the same time that the Abstract Expressionist movement began in New York City. Three years later, in 1951, Pepi joined with many of the innovators of Action Painting in New York City. Upon his return to the United States, Pepi studied briefly with Hans Hofmann. Along with other first generation abstract expressionists, he showed his work at the Stable GalleryNew York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists, (New York School Press, 2000.) , p.38 in 1953 and at the March Gallery on Tenth Street, from 1955 until its closing in 1960. Pepi attended the \\"Artists' Club\\"Bruce Altshuler, Avant-Garde In Exhibition New Art in the 20th Century, New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1994, Chapter 9, p.171 from time to time, but preferred his own studio and a more solitary existence. A graphics business which he created permitted him to live and paint while freeing him from the necessity of regularly exhibiting his work. His choice to live in Italy from 1949‚Äì51, during a crucial time in the formation of the New York School, as well as his preference for painting in a consistently smaller format, may have obscured the recognition and fame that otherwise might have been his. The artist's acknowledged sources range from old masters to the Futurists (especially Boccioni and Balla): from Klee and Kandinsky to Matta, Gorky and Pepi's contemporaries. His academically trained teacher in Italy, Beppe Guzzi, helped him to incorporate rigorous discipline into his painting, as well as introducing him to a number of important Italian painters and sculptors. Like Pollock and other Abstract Expressionists he admires, Pepi has always loved music, particularly jazz, going as far as learning to play the tenor saxophone. Color and music appear parallel to him: the artist/ musician improvises with both. And so it follows that Pepi's own automatic painting and line poems\\" are reminiscent of works by Paul Klee, with the latter's powerful equations of color, line and music. Pepi defines himself as an academic artist, but one who felt he had to take that \\"main highway between C√©zanne and Kandinsky\\". His paintings do indeed, reveal a C√©zanne-like underpinning of abstract structure, while adopting the free improvisatory phase of Kandinsky at the same time. It is the revelation of the unconscious that Pepi seeks in his work. He wants his work to be spontaneous and uncontrived.

Attitash consists of old New England-style trails. The more challenging terrain on this mountain are narrow trails with challenging fall lines. It also offers a learning center, featuring a Snowbelt, Learning Center chairlift and the Double Double chairlift (627 vertical feet in 11 minutes), which provides access to longer greens trails. Bear Peak was developed by the American Ski Company and features wider trails and glades. Both mountains have high-speed quads, the Flying Bear at Bear Peak taking skiers straight to the summit (1,462 vertical feet in 8 minutes), and the Flying Yankee at Attitash taking skiers halfway up the mountain (860 vertical feet in 6 minutes). The Summit Triple (1,659 vertical feet) takes about 11.5 minutes to get to the top. In the era of Peak Resorts, snowmaking and grooming were vastly improved. Despite concerns from locals, Peak was the company that managed to finally get the resort out of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. While the halfpipe was removed, the terrain park was arguably improved by splitting it into three separate parks and moving them all to Bear Peak, allowing the blue they originally occupied to be used for the ski school. In the second half of the 2018/2019 season, the top half of Attitash was closed due to major problems with the Summit Triple. Despite a fairly new bull wheel (replaced just a few years earlier), it was found to also be in need of massive repair to the gear box, including a replacement \\"planetary gear\\". The triple's replacement has long been a hot topic. While hopes are the new owners (Vail Resorts) can finally replace it, for now the Summit Triple was noticeably repaired (the new planetary gear in the base station is silver, not black) and has run smoothly. It is unknown at the time what investments by Vail Resorts, who closed the deal in October 2019, plans to make in the former Peak Resorts properties, including Attitash. Summer Attitash also has summer activities, including a miniature water park, an alpine slide, mountain biking, and horseback riding. Peak Resorts has brought new attractions like the year-round mountain coaster (a faster, powered version of the alpine slide), a climbing wall, four Euro bungee trampolines, a giant air bag jump, and the newest attraction, the East Coast's longest single-span zip-line. Peak Resorts improved year-round operation in hopes for high enough profit to replace the Summit Triple with a high-speed quad. So far this has not succeeded yet and it is unknown how Vail Resorts will change summer (and winter) operations at the time.

During World War II, for their first time, Red Food sold turkeys for forty-five cents per pound to customers for Thanksgiving. They also told customers to \\"invite a soldier and serve turkey this Thanksgiving.\\" In 1979, Promod√®s, a food distribution firm based in Caen, France, made a bid to buy Red Food Stores, Inc. for $23 million. By 1980, the acquisition was completed, for a total of $36 million. The Red Food purchase gave Promod√®s 23 supermarkets centered primarily in southern Tennessee, plus additional stores in Georgia and Alabama as well. In order to finance Promod√®s' expansion, which would invest more than Ffr 2 billion between 1979 and 1984, the company went public in 1979. On April, 1989, Red Food Store's purchase of seven supermarkets in its hometown owned by Kroger Co. was halted at virtually the 11th hour by the Federal Trade Commission, which decided the merger would substantially hamper competition in the market. The FTC action came unexpectedly. A month later, the FTC issued a complaint, challenging Red Food Stores' $6.5 million acquisition of all seven Kroger Co. grocery stores in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The commission lodged the complaint after a Federal appeals court rejected its request for an injunction blocking the transaction.

Cultivation and uses Lobelia erinus is a very popular edging plant in gardens, especially for hanging baskets and window boxes. In temperate areas of the world, its varieties are popular ornamental plants for gardens and balconies. Some of the varieties are propagated with seeds, other varieties are vegetatively propagated only through cuttings; it depends on whether the varieties are \\"seedy\\". It has a particularly long flowering period, from mid spring to early autumn. It is perennial where temperatures remain above freezing, and is often grown as an annual plant in colder areas. It is widely available in Spring as a young plant, but must be kept indoors until all danger of frost has passed. =Cultivars= Numerous cultivars have been selected, either with a bushy or a trailing habit, in a wide range of flower colours, including white, pink, magenta (\\"red\\"), pale to dark blue, and purple, often with a prominent white eye.

He studied natural history at the University of G√∂ttingen, and later taught classes in natural history at the Muri monastery in Aargau. From 1851 to 1856 he was a professor of natural history at the ETH Zurich, and afterwards taught geology at the Forschungsinstitut Senckenberg. From 1859 to 1881 he taught geology and mineralogy at the Freie Deutsche Hochstift in Frankfurt-am-Main. Volger made contributions in the fields of mineralogy and crystallography, and was particularly interested in earthquakes. He did extensive study of earthquakes in Switzerland; researching their origins, periodicity, meteorological and environmental factors, as well as the spread and expansion of the quakes. Volger advocated the theory of neptunism. Independent of geologist Robert Mallet (1810-1881), he created his own neptunistic theory of wave propagation of earthquakes. Volger believed that most earthquakes in Switzerland were subsidence quakes caused by collapse of layers of hollow strata in the Earth. In 1863, Volger purchased the birthplace of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), and meticulously restored the house to the condition left by Goethe's father.

The cells flock together, forming a mass that behaves as an organised, slug-like unit. Before they get stimulated to crowd together to form a grex, the amoebae simply wander as independent cells grazing on bacteria and other suitable food items. They continue in that way of life as long as conditions are favourable. When the amoebae are stressed, typically by a shortage of food, they form a grex. According to species and circumstances, details of the shape of the grex and how it may form will vary but typically the stressed amoebae first produce pheromones that stimulate the flock to assemble in a vertical column. When the column of aggregated cells becomes too high and narrow to stay upright, it topples and becomes a slug-shaped mass: the grex. The grex is mobile; in its form as a slug-like unit it can glide over a moist surface. Once it has moved far enough to complete its development, the cells of the amoebae differentiate according to their positions in the grex; some become the spore cells and the covering shell of the fruiting body near the tip, and others form structures such as the stalk. Cells forming the structural items, such as the stalk and shell, desiccate and die; only the spores in the fruiting body survive to propagate. When circumstances are right and the fruiting body is mature, its shell ruptures and releases the spores. The spores then may be transported by media such as wind or water; they then may cover distances far greater than any that they could have achieved in their amoeboid form, and over regions where amoebae could not travel at all, such as dry surfaces.

Established in 1880 it is one of the oldest parks in Japan. Administratively, the park is under the control of Nara Prefecture. The park is one of the \\"Places of Scenic Beauty\\" designated by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). Over 1,200 wild sika deer ( or shika) freely roaming around in the park are also under designation of MEXT, classified as natural treasure. While the official size of the park is about , the area including the grounds of T≈çdai-ji, K≈çfuku-ji, and Kasuga Shrine, which are either on the edge or surrounded by Nara Park, is as large as . While Nara Park is usually associated with the broad areas of the temples and the park proper, previously private gardens are now open to public. These gardens make use of the temple buildings as adjunct features of their landscapes. The park is home to the Nara National Museum and Todai-ji, where the largest wooden building in the world houses a 15-metre (50 ft) tall statue of Buddha.Frommer's Japan 8th Edition (2006) Deer Sika deer in Nara Park According to local folklore, Sika deer from this area were considered sacred due to a visit from Takemikazuchi-no-mikoto, one of the four gods of Kasuga Shrine.Fodor's Japan 18th Edition (2007) He was said to have been invited from Kashima Shrine in present-day Ibaraki Prefecture, and appeared on Mount Mikasa (also known as Mount Wakakusa) riding a white deer. From that point, the deer were considered divine and sacred by both Kasuga Shrine and K≈çfuku-ji. Killing one of these sacred deer was a capital offense punishable by death up until 1637, the last recorded date of a breach of that law. Crackers sold for deer feeding After World War II, the deer were officially stripped of their sacred/divine status, and were instead designated as national treasures and are protected as such. Today, visitors can purchase \\"deer-crackers\\" ( Shika-senbei) to feed the deer in the park. These crackers are exclusively sold by the WNOW company. The number of deer grew in the postwar period to around 1,200 in 2008, leading to concerns about environmental and crop damage and discussion of culling. In 2010 a man was sentenced to six months in prison for killing a deer with a crossbow. During fiscal 2016 a record number of 121 people were injured by deer. In 2016 it was announced that the area around Nara would be designated into four different zones, with the outer zones allowing deer to be captured and killed. The culling started in 2017, with a limit of 120 deer to be culled during 2017. As of July 2017 there were around 1,500 deer living in the park, and at least 164 people had been injured by them in fiscal 2017‚Äì2018. Most of them were tourists feeding the deer. In August 2017 traps were set to catch deer on the outskirts of Nara. Most Japanese news coverage of the story did not include the fact the deer caught in the traps would be killed. In April 2018 Nara city set up new signs in English, Chinese and Japanese informing tourists that the deer are wild animals and to not tease them during feeding. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Japanese government implemented travel restrictions. The amount of tourists feeding the Nara deer decreased significantly. The deer lost a vital source of food and have begun to forage outside of the park. There are concerns that the deer could get hit by vehicles or die from eating harmful plastic.

Remy) (born 29 November 1983) is a New Zealand composer, record producer, musician, multi-instrumentalist, DJ and film maker best known for his ONE FAT MAN album \\"A Typical Day in Suburbia\\", and his \\"Symphony No 1 for Orchestra and Turntables\\", which was performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra (APO). The premiere performance was given by the Wellington Youth Orchestra (WYO) in 2005.  Biography  Born and raised in Hamilton, NZ he was schooled in music from age 5. Starting with piano lessons, he progressed on to drums, harmonica, and bass. He now plays turntables, synths, melodica, and theremin among others. He also likes to perform using unconventional instruments such as iPhones, and watering cans. He also regularly sings with several bands, and in theatrical stage shows. He has performed throughout NZ, as well as in Fiji, Noum√©a, Vanuatu, Singapore and the US. Academic study has been based at the University of Waikato and has a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) ‚Äì majoring in Music, and a master's degree (receiving First Class Honours), majoring in composition. He is currently completing doctoral study in musical composition at the University of Waikato. For all his graduate study Jeremy has been awarded a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship, and was Creative/Performing Arts Person of the Year for 2005, Media Personality of the Year 2005 and the inaugural winner of the Sir Edmund Hillary Medal. He was also the recipient of the Hamilton City Council BeatStreet award for Excellence in Creative and Performing Arts, and the Hamilton City Council Supreme Youth Award in 2008. He married Courteney Mayall (n√©e Bell) on 1 May 2010. She is a hairstylist and special FX make-up artist. Music His music exists in almost all genres, including solo and chamber music, orchestral music, music for theatre and film, pop, hip-hop, jazz, as well as electro-acoustic music. His works always tend to favour the bizarre or fantastical elements of the imagination and his pieces always tend to look for a new form of expression, whether through turntables in an orchestra, to live electro-acoustic music for electric bass and turntables, to kitchen utensils as musical instruments. A fascination with Hip Hop music and culture, as well as the historical interest in many other musical forms (Jazz, Soul, Funk) and his interest in Film, has been a strong influence on his music. At the age of 20 he wrote his first symphony ‚Äì Symphony No 1 for Orchestra and Turntables (which has been performed by the APO, NZSO, WYO, DYO and NZSSSO). This is the first symphony to be written including modern turntablist techniques. He also released his first album through his production and pop music identity of ONE FAT MAN. The album 'a typical day in suburbia' received excellent reviews. It features styles that span the musical continuum from jazz to pop, to soul and hip hop. The album featured a range of local performers from Remy's home town of Hamilton, NZ. It contains tracks by local singers (Stephie Christian, Linda Dee, Landy Tyrell, Silua Fifita); rappers (Hitz, Ptt); and instrumentalists (Mike Mello, Rat Daddy, James Sutherland, Black C). More recently Mayall has been performing and recording live electro-acoustic soundscapes for turntables, watering cans, electronics and taonga puoro with Richard Nunns and with performance ensemble Sonic Warp with Daniel Peters. He has also been recording electro/synth-pop with his side project ‚Ä¶howard. This band has already created a 7 track EP ‚Äì Remaking Pearl Harbour, and an 11 track concept album They no longer sleep alone. This concept album has since been developed into a feature-length film by Chasing Time Productions. Film and theatre music Mayall regularly writes film music. In 2007 he composed, recorded and produced all the sound elements and music for the film-noir horror 'Down by the Riverside'. (Downending Films site). 'Down by the Riverside' was nominated for BEST FOREIGN FILM at the B-Movie Festival in New York. He has also composed the score and sound design for \\"Pictures of You\\" and \\"They No Longer Sleep Alone\\" both by Chasing Time Productions. Other recent film projects include the narrative dance films Lucid and Beat. He has also recently formed at film music composing team called The Scorelocks Collective with fellow Hamilton composer Chris Lam Sam. Three films they have scored have been accepted into international festivals. (Finding Marilyn in Castel del'Aquila, Lily White and Hunter) In theatre music, Mayall has most often written musicals. Including the songs for \\"Alice and the Velvetty Tea cup\\", \\"Santa Claus\\" and most recently \\"Life in the Key of...\\" which was produced for the Hamilton Ignition Fringe Festival 2010, and received strong reviews.

The man seems to have come for an official duty for UN and seeing the calmness of the place, decides to stay here for his work. There comes a twist of what is exactly the man up to and how the main character of the novel solves the problem. The story is simple, and the author honestly admits to being a short story writer, rather than a novelist as he tells; most of the people skip the intrinsic details given about the places and only catch the content (at the end of the book, his words about the story). It is a good read book and can be read for the calmness with which Narayan writes his story, as a critic rightly points out . References Category:1986 novels Category:Novels by R. K.

It stars Joe Estevez in the title role, alongside Vivian Schilling, Gregg Thomsen, Chuck Williams, Robert Z'Dar, and David \\"Shark\\" Fralick. The film follows a group of young adults who try to flee from the titular \\"Soultaker\\" when their souls are ejected from their bodies after a car accident. Inspired by discussions with Action International Pictures producer Eric Parkinson, the script was based on a real-life car accident Schilling was involved in. The film was shot in five weeks on a $250,000 budget. Originally planned for a direct-to-video release, it saw limited theatrical screenings, with eight prints distributed in United States. Since its release, the film has received negative reviews, but won the Saturn Award for \\"Best Genre Video Release\\" in 1992. A sequel was planned, and actors such as James Earl Jones and Faye Dunaway were named for the cast, but the film was never made and Schilling turned its premise into a novel titled Quietus, published in 2002. Soultaker was featured in the tenth-season premiere episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1999. Plot During a summer festival, the Angel of Death (Robert Z'Dar) instructs his \\"Soultaker\\" subordinate (Joe Estevez) to kill five people: Zack (Gregg Thomsen), Zack's friends Brad (David \\"Shark\\" Fralick) and Tommy (Chuck Williams), Brad's girlfriend Candice (Cinda Lou Freeman), and Zack's ex- girlfriend Natalie (Vivian Schilling). After Natalie's friend leaves her behind, Zack offers her a ride home in Brad's car, although Brad is high on cocaine and reluctant to accept her as a passenger. Driving home at high speed, Brad crashes the car to avoid hitting the Soultaker. Candice dies instantly while Natalie, Brad, Zack, and Tommy fall comatose as their souls leave their bodies. The Soultaker then takes Candice's soul and informs the Angel of Death, who orders him to recover the other souls. Thinking they survived the crash, the four return to the car, unaware their bodies were taken to a hospital. There, Soultaker reveals himself and claims Brad's soul; the others, helpless to stop him, flee. They run into a convenience store and attempt to tell the cashierwho cannot see themthat someone is after them. While inside, they see a news report on the crash, which confuses them, and Natalie accuses Zack of knowing Brad had been using drugs. They leave the store and call emergency services, but the operator cannot hear them and hangs up on them. Appearing again, the Soultaker tries to claim Natalie's soul, but her resemblance to his past lover, whom he killed in his former life, stays his hand. Zack rescues her and they flee, leaving Tommy behind. The Angel of Death reprimands his subordinate for failing to take her soul, and the Soultaker then takes Tommy's. Zack and Natalie go to her house, where they tell her mother Anna (Jean Reiner) about the Soultaker. Zack and Natalie reconcile while Anna prepares a bath for her. While she bathes, Anna watches her from behind the bathroom door. Meanwhile, Zack learns from a live television announcement from Natalie's father Mayor Grant (David Fawcett) that their life support systems will be turned off at midnight. During the broadcast, Anna appears onscreen; at the same time, the \\"Anna\\" watching Natalie suddenly morphs into the Soultaker. He attempts to make a pact with her, offering her eternal life on the condition that she stays by his side forever. Zack arrives and attempts to attack the Soultaker, but is overpowered. Natalie tries to shoot the Soultaker to no effect. When she tells the Soultaker she wants to be with Zack, the Soultaker throws him out of the window. Zack survives the fall. Hoping to return to their bodies before midnight, Natalie and Zack flee to the hospital. Natalie is captured by the Soultaker on an elevator which leads to the afterlife; he claims he is an angel charged with collecting souls. He convinces her there is nothing left for her in the living realm, that Zack is already dead, and that she can be saved if she stays with him. While searching for her, Zack encounters Brad, who has become a Soultaker, as those who kill someoneeven by accidentmust pay for it with service as a grim reaper. With Brad's help, he enters the afterlife and rescues Natalie. Brad gives him two empty \\"soul rings\\", which can help him and Natalie return to their bodies. They find Natalie's body, and she places herself in the ring but remains comatose. Discovering that her pendant is acting as a barrier between her soul and her body, Zack pulls her soul from her body to reattempt the process when the Soultaker reappears. After a chase around the hospital, Zack escapes by leaping off the roof. The Soultaker is confronted by the Angel of Death, who tells him that he has failed since it is now past midnight. Despite his pleas, the Soultaker is imprisoned into a soul ring by his master. Zack returns to his body and saves Natalie's life; he later visits her when she is discharged from the hospital. Cast Production Soultaker was written by Vivian Schilling, who was inspired to write the film after discussions with Action International Pictures producer Eric Parkinson. Schilling based her script on a real-life car accident that happened to her and a friend. The script was written in the span of four months. Actor Joe Estevez was asked to play the mayor, Grant McMillan, before being cast as the titular \\"Soultaker\\". As well as writing the script for the film, Schilling played the female lead Natalie McMillan. This was Schilling's first starring role in a film. Her previous acting credits included Fred Olen Ray's science fiction film Prison Ship and a nurse in the soap opera General Hospital. Soultaker was shot in Mobile, Alabama, in five weeks with a budget of $250,000. In early 1989, 26-year-old Michael Rissi was hired to direct the film after the previous director left the project. Soultaker was his first main feature; he had previously directed the 1987 short film Snake Eyes, part of the anthology movie Terror Eyes Eric Parkinson and Vivian Schilling were involved with. Originally reluctant to direct, Rissi decided to join after being interested in filming a movie involving parallel universes. Rissi's contributions to the film resulted in its being released as \\"A Michael Rissi Film\\" for both the promotional material and film credits. Production wrapped in July 1989. Action International Pictures bought the movie, which became their biggest movie at that time. Problems mounted during production. During the filming of the car-crash scene, the car could not be started, causing the loss of a half-day's production. In an interview with Femme Fatales, Vivian Schilling noted that almost a third of the script had to be re-written because of time and money constraints. Schilling later wrote an article for the magazine about a scene added by investors and the film crew, in which she was asked to appear naked. Despite claims it would increase sales for the film, Schilling avoided appearing nude in the scene. Release Soultaker was distributed by Action International Pictures. Originally planned to be released straight to video, it received a limited theatrical release; eight prints of it were distributed in the United States on October 26, 1990. Because Action International Pictures did not have a theatrical distribution division, Eric Parkinson did the process by himself. Vivian Schilling said the movie was successful in theaters except her hometown, Wichita, Kansas. She also mentioned it selling well on VHS and in overseas markets. Soultaker was released on VHS on January 24, 1991. It was also released on DVD by Imagine Entertainment in 1999 and Hannover House in 2005. =Reception= Critical reception for Soultaker has been mostly negative, with criticism directed at the film's story and special effects. Los Angeles Times writer Mark Chalon Smith unfavorably compared Soultaker to 1968's Night of the Living Dead, both of which were made with a small budget. Smith said having a small budget \\"doesn't necessarily mean a movie can't be fun and scary\\", but that Soultaker was not fun. Blockbuster Entertainment gave the film two stars, while VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever by Jim Craddock gave it one and a half stars. TV Guide gave it one star, criticizing the storyline and special effects while describing the acting as \\"adequate\\". It would later be on IMDb's \\"Bottom 100\\" list. Variety's Larry Cohn spoke positively about Soultaker, writing that its portrayal of the afterlife was more consistent than the film Ghost. Time Out called the film a \\"micro-budget variation on Ghost\\", criticizing the special effects and Michael Rissi's direction but praising Vivian Schilling for her work. Michael Dare of Billboard directed praise towards the film in his review, calling it a \\"good looking, low-budget fantasy thriller\\", though he noted the cast's overacting and the movie's transformation into \\"several layers of advanced silliness\\" after the Angel of Death's introduction. In 1992, the film won the \\"Best Genre Video Release\\" award during the 18th Saturn Awards. In his 2011 book Horror Films of the 1990s, John Kenneth Muir gave the movie two stars, noting the \\"apparent egotism\\" Schilling had being both the screenwriter and lead. Robert Z'Dar and Joe Estevez were both criticized for not being as menacing as they intended to be. He also compared Soultaker to Ghost and Flatliners, all three films released in 1990 and shared the same theme of a universal hierarchy that is not seen. He considered Soultakers interpretation of the theme to be the \\"cheesiest\\" of the three but mentioned that the movie had fewer resources to work with. Legacy =Sequel= A sequel was planned for the movie; it went through several name changes, including \\"Dark Angel\\" and \\"Dark World\\". Producers planned to cast James Earl Jones and Faye Dunaway in one iteration of the production, and Donald Sutherland was also in talks. Robert Z'Dar commented that William Shatner was interested in playing the boss of Z'Dar's character. Director Tibor Tak√°cs was due to direct the project, and production was planned for January 1993 in Canada. However, the project fell through due to funding issues. The concept of the unmade script was turned into a novel; Schilling said she \\"embellished the premise\\" and added new characters to the story. Titled Quietus, the book was released in January 2002 as her second novel and was published by Hannover House, having taken seven years to write. =Mystery Science Theater 3000= Soultaker was featured in the tenth-season premiere episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K), a comedy television series whose premise is that the character Mike Nelson and his two robot friends Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo are forced to watch bad films as part of an ongoing scientific experiment. Broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel on April 11, 1999, the episode also saw the guest appearances of series creator and original host of MST3K Joel Hodgson as Joel Robinson and Frank Conniff as TV's Frank. Jokes comparing Vivian Schilling to Tonya Harding were made. Schilling did not watch the episode but did not like the comparisons with Harding. John Kenneth Muir cited the movie's appearance in the episode as causing the movie to have a \\"bad movie\\" reputation, despite initial positive reviews. The episode was considered one of the best episodes in the series, both by critics and by fans of the show. Erik Adams from The A.V. Club called it one of the most essential episodes, opining that Joel Hodgson's appearing in it was a \\"stamp of approval\\" for the show after he left its production. Jim Vorel for Paste ranked it as the 44th best in the entire series, calling the film an \\"overdramatic vanity project from the starlet/screenwriter\\" and praising the episode both for its riffing and for its host segments. A fan poll for the top 100 best episodes in the series voted it as eighteenth, the highest for a season ten episode. Elliott Kalan, the head writer for the Netflix era of the series, placed it as one of his favorite episodes in the series. Charles Bramesco for The Dissolve cited both Soultaker and later MST3K \\"experiment\\" Future War for increasing the popularity of Robert Z'Dar. In 2009, Shout! Factory released the MST3K episode as part of the \\"Volume XIV\\" DVD collection of the series, along with The Mad Monster, Manhunt in Space, and Final Justice. Joe Estevez was interviewed for the DVD. In 2016, Shout! announced it had lost the rights to the Soultaker episode, resulting in \\"Volume XIV\\" going out of print.

The Nichols family used the property as a summer weekend retreat and occupied a small farmhouse. But after a number of years, the family desired a larger home. In the 1920s, Nichols set out to build his country estate, preferring the Norman style of architecture from the south of England and the north of France. He hired Augustus N. Allen as his architect and the two toured Europe to seek out Norman style buildings and designed Pleasantdale Chateau. The exterior of the house, which was completed in 1933, is of the Norman half- timber and stucco character, while the interior reflects a number of period styles. The grounds of the Chateau property were designed by renowned 20th Century landscape architect Ethelbert E. Furlong of nearby Glen Ridge, New Jersey, whose work is catalogued in the Smithsonian Institute's American Gardens collection. The land surrounding the Chateau was transformed from ordinary woodlands to rolling pastoral terrain and an intricate complex of formal gardens, only some of which has been maintained. ‚Üí The estate was acquired by Allied in 1963 to be used as a conference and training center.

It ran from the village of North Stratford, New Hampshire (in the town of Stratford) to the village of Beecher Falls in Canaan, Vermont, a distance of approximately . History =Origin of the line= The line was originally conceived by George van Dyke, who owned large tracts of forest in Vermont and Quebec. Starting in 1883, van Dyke obtained the following charters to build the line, listed from south to north: *Upper Coos Railroad of New Hampshire (first section) - in New Hampshire *Coos Valley Railroad - in Vermont *Upper Coos Railroad of New Hampshire (second section) - in New Hampshire *Upper Coos Railroad of Vermont - in Vermont *Hereford Railroad - in Quebec, Canada Construction began in 1887 on the second section of the Upper Coos Railroad of New Hampshire between North Stratford, where the railroad connected to the Grand Trunk Railway, and Stewartstown, New Hampshire. Operations started the same year. A bridge across the Connecticut River from Stewartstown to Beecher Falls was built in 1888, and the Upper Coos Railroad of Vermont was completed north to the border a few months later. In Canada, of track of the Hereford Railroad from the border near Beecher Falls north to Cookshire, Quebec were laid in 1889, allowing interchange with the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1890 the final of track in Quebec were laid to Lime Ridge, which allowed interchange with the Quebec Central Railway in Dudswell, Quebec. Construction south of North Stratford took longer, and the entire section went into service in 1891. In this area, the line connected to the Boston and Maine Railroad in Lancaster, New Hampshire, again at Waumbeck Junction in Jefferson, New Hampshire, and then met the Maine Central Railroad at Quebec Junction in Carroll, New Hampshire. =Maine Central Railroad= In 1890, the Maine Central Railroad gained control of the line through a series of leases. The MEC operated the line without fanfare until 1925, when it canceled its lease with the Hereford Railroad. After an extended legal battle, the tracks from the border north to Malvina, Quebec were removed. In 1948, the MEC negotiated trackage rights with the Grand Trunk Railway and the Boston and Maine Railroad between North Stratford and Lancaster. This rendered of track in Vermont and in New Hampshire redundant, and the rails were removed. Traffic on the section from North Stratford to Beecher Falls remained sufficient to keep the line open through the 1960s, but had declined enough by the early 1970s that the MEC embargoed the line after floods in 1973. The MEC filed for abandonment, but was forced to reopen the line in 1974. =North Stratford Railroad= In 1976 the state of New Hampshire bought the track between North Stratford and Beecher Falls from MEC, which had finally obtained permission to abandon it. A separate, short section of track between Waumbeck Junction and Quebec Junction was abandoned by the MEC at this time as well. The state chartered the North Stratford Railroad Corporation to operate the line, which primarily served a furniture plant in Beecher Falls. Traffic tapered off as the main shipper moved more and more goods by truck, and the line was embargoed in 1989. For a short time in 1981, the North Stratford Railroad also operated the White Mountain Branch between Concord and Lincoln as an interim operator before the New England Southern Railroad stepped in.

It was released worldwide on the Xbox Live Arcade service on March 28, 2007. The game is the fourth installment of the Jetman series and a remake of Ultimate Play the Game's 1983 ZX Spectrum game, Jetpac. The game follows Jetman as he attempts to rebuild his rocket in order to explore different planets, whilst simultaneously defending himself from hostile aliens. Details of the game were leaked in February 2007, shortly before Rare announced development one month later. During the development process, Rare attempted to ensure that the game did not feel too similar to the original Jetpac, while keeping the core mechanics. The game received mostly favorable reviews upon release. Critics praised the updated graphics and gameplay, however they criticized the overall repetitiveness of the game and its multiplayer mode. It was later rereleased as part of Rare's 2015 Xbox One compendium compilation Rare Replay, along with all three original Jetman games. Gameplay A still image of gameplay. Jetman must collect various fuel pods before he can leave this planet The game is a remake of the original Jetpac with overhauled high-definition graphics and 128 levels. It also features competitive gameplay over Xbox Live, leaderboards, and achievements. Similar to the first instalment, the player assumes control of Jetman and is presented in a horizontal wrap around which consists of six platforms on which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman has to first assemble his rocket, which spawns in separate parts that are scattered around a map, and then fills it with six fuel canisters before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is repeated. In addition, Jetman has to defend himself from each planet's hostile aliens, and collect valuable resources such as gold and platinum, which occasionally fall from the atmosphere, for bonus points. Jetman's only usable weapon in his laser. Weapon upgrades may also spawn around a map, which once picked up will give Jetman various upgrades to his weapon. Upgrades include as a wider fire spread, faster projectiles or higher damage. The player starts the game with three nuclear devices, which once used will eliminate all enemies from the screen. Jetman also has the ability to boost, which will temporarily make him move at a much faster speed, although boosts will need to recharge once they are depleted. Jetpac Refuelled features a multiplayer mode that can be played either offline using a split screen or online via Xbox Live. In this mode, the player has to compete one-on-one in a race to build and refuel their craft before their opponent does. Fuel and rocket pickups can be stolen from opponents by shooting them or by using an EMP blast at close range. Lives are unlimited in multiplayer and the winner is determined by the highest score. A version of the original 1983 Jetpac is also included in the game. Development Details of a Jetpac remake were first leaked on a listing on the website of German rating board Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle on February 6, 2007. Rare officially announced development of Jetpac Refuelled on February 22, 2007. In a retrospective interview, Rare designers Jens Restemeier and Nick Burton took interest in the then-upcoming Xbox Live Arcade and offered to develop a new game for the service after the release of Rare's Xbox 360 launch titles Kameo and Perfect Dark Zero. Because of the smaller scale of the project, the team had total creative control and were generally left alone throughout development. Rather than simply porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360, the development team decided to expand upon Jetpac and experiment with new elements. The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game. Restemeier also stated that the development process for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title, owing to processing power limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live. Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live service was the way optimizations shifted from graphics and game logic, stating that this was more difficult than it would have been for an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo. In a separate interview with Next-Gen magazine, Burton stated that during initial development of Jetpac Refuelled, senior management kept away entirely from the project. When Rare's management allowed themselves to view the game, they offered the developers \\"a fresh eye and more frank criticism\\". Further development took place before management were shown the game again in what was nicknamed a \\"clean room\\" test. Jetpac Refuelled, along with every title in the Jetman series, appeared in the retrospective 2015 retrospective compilation of 30 Rare titles, Rare Replay for Xbox One. Reception The game was met with mostly favourable reviews upon release. Reviewers praised the updated graphics and addictive gameplay, however they criticised the overall repetitiveness of the game and its mediocre multiplayer mode. It received an aggregate score of 72% from GameRankings based on 16 reviews, and an average score of 73 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 17 reviews. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer praised the visual makeover the new game, calling it \\"undoubtedly the best addition\\" to the series. Greg Stewart of GamesRadar labelled the updated graphics as \\"trippy\\", preferring them over the \\"primitive\\" original. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot praised the updated graphics as the best addition to the game, heralding them as \\"crisp, bright and colourful\\" and far superior to the original 1983 version. Jonathan Miller of IGN similarly thought the graphics were the strongest aspect of the game, praising the effects as \\"vibrant and colourful\\" whilst calling the ZX Spectrum version \\"nostalgically bad\\". Miller also added that the updated visuals of the game made the experience feel \\"almost 10 times the game as the original\\". Reed criticised the repetitiveness of the game, stating that whilst 128 levels was good value for money, the gameplay was \\"merely a repeat\\" of what the player has already accomplished and that the multiplayer mode could prove \\"annoying very quickly\\". Stewart also criticised the game's repetitiveness and stated that he felt general gameplay was \\"shallow\\", despite admitting it was addictive. Gerstmann similarly found the action repetitive and stated that there was \\"not enough variety\\", especially in the multiplayer mode. However, Miller praised the gameplay as \\"fast, fun and addictive\\", as he expected a game on the Xbox Live Arcade to be. Will Freeman of Video Gamer noted that the large number of levels caused the game to feel repetitive, but praised the overall addictiveness and fast pace of the game.

It was the last of Shirley's plays produced before the major break in his career: with the closing of the London theatres due to bubonic plague in May 1636, Shirley left England for Ireland, where he worked under John Ogilby at the Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin for four years. The Duke's Mistress was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 18 January 1636, and was acted by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre. On 22 February 1636 it was performed at St. James's Palace before the King and Queen, Charles I and Henrietta Maria. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 13 March 1638 and was published in quarto later that year, printed by John Norton for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke, the partners who issued many of Shirley's plays in that era. Curiously, surviving copies of the quarto differ in identification of the publishers; some copies name Crooke alone, while others mention only Cooke.Nason, pp. 98-9. The play shares some clear similarities with contemporaneous works like The Queen and Concubine by Richard Brome and A Wife for a Month by John Fletcher.Forsythe, p. 199. Shirley's use of the idea of men who are attracted to ugly women has provoked commentary on the psychological and other aspects of such a fixation.Peter Ure, \\"The 'Deformed Mistress' Theme and the Platonic Convention,\\" Notes and Queries 193 (1948), pp. 269-70. Synopsis The Duke's Mistress employs the three-level plot structure that Shirley favors through much of his output. In the main plot, Dionisio Farnese, the Duke of Parma, tries to dismiss his faithful wife Euphemia and win Ardelia as his mistress. The secondary plot reverses the main plot situation: Leontio, Farnese's kinsman and heir, loves the Duchess, and plans to murder the Duke and take his place. In the comic subplot, Horatio woos Ardelia's waiting-woman Fiametta, only to abandon her to pursue another; Horatio has an obsession with homely women -- the homelier they are, the more strongly he is attracted to them. The play opens with a celebration in Ardelia's favor -- which is interrupted by Duchess Euphemia, who melodramatically begs her husband to put her to death now that she has lost his affection. A crucial misunderstanding occurs when Ardelia, not having heard the Duchess's plea and being ignorant of its nature, tells the Duke that he should fulfill the Duchess's request, whatever it is. The Duchess vows revenge on her husband and Ardelia. Farnese incarcerates his wife, and places his heir Leontio in charge of her; he already suspects Leontio's attraction for her. In the midst of this, Bentivolio, Ardelia's fianc√©, returns to the Duke's court after an absence. He accuses Ardelia of betrayal of their engagement. When the Duke arrives, Ardelia hides Bentivolio, and while he listens from hiding she manipulates Farnese into an admission that she has not yet submitted to him sexually. But a courtier named Valerio knows the situation of Bentivolio and Ardelia, and threatens to expose Bentivolio to the Duke's anger unless Ardelia sleeps with him, Valerio. Playing for time, Ardelia arranges a meeting with Valerio. Leontio has bribed Pallante, a captain, to assassinate the Duke. Valerio overhears their plot, and joins their conspiracy. He also prevails upon Bentivolio to kill the Duke, assuring him that the new Duke, Leontio, will offer a pardon. In her chamber, Ardelia resists Valerio, and when he tries to rape her she draws a pistol on him. Bentivolio arrives; Valerio, thinking the Duke has come, hides behind a tapestry. Bentivolio, likewise mistaking the man behind the arras, runs him through with his sword (as Hamlet does to Polonius in Hamlet, III,iv). Thinking he has killed the Duke, Bentivolio flees with Ardelia. Pallante comes to Leontio, telling him that he has killed Farnese, who repented of his crimes and sins before he died. Then Bentivolio and Ardelia are brought in, apprehended by the guards; and Bentivolio too admits to having killed the Duke. Leontio opportunistically sends the lovers to prison for the crime, thus throwing suspicion from himself and his henchman. Leontio rushes to the Duchess, to stake his claim to Farnese's wife as well as his dukedom -- but the still-living Farnese is with her. Pallante lied about the Duke's death, but told the truth about Farnese's repentance -- for that is what caused the assassin to spare his victim's life. Believing the Duke is dead, Leontio mistakes Farnese for one of his own servants; Leontio carelessly tells Euphemia that Farnese's death leaves her free for him. Euphemia rejects Leontio, and Farnese kills him. The Duke and Duchess reconcile, and Bentivolio and Ardelia marry. Notes Sources * Clark, Ira.

It was the main anchor of the Baldwin Avenue shopping strip, and the only large department store in Arcadia until a branch of May Company opened several years later. In the mid-1950s, Hinshaw's opened a second branch, this in the new Whittier Quad Shopping Center in Whittier. Hinshaw's was one of two anchor stores in the quad, its complement being another branch of The May Company. The Whittier branch of Hinshaw's also had of space. Both branches had multi-level parking garages despite their suburban locations. The Whittier Quad shopping center was badly damaged by the Whittier Narrows earthquake of 1987, but Hinshaw's building suffered the least damage and remained open as the center's only tenant for several years. Sales were poor, and remained down even after the rest of the Quad was rebuilt, and the company announced the store's closure in December 1991.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1992-01-08-ga-1623-story.html The Arcadia store was closed a few months later in 1992. The company had been at that time the last surviving independent department store chain in Los Angeles County. Hinshaw's Arcadia location prospered for a while but ultimately closed in the face of competition from the nearby Westfield Santa Anita shopping center, which underwent a major expansion in the 1990s. The closed store was replaced by a Burlington Coat Factory store, which opened in 1998-1999.

He resigned from The Nationals in August 2017, and is currently an independent member of parliament. Early life and education Northe was born in Traralgon, Victoria and attended Traralgon High School, completing Year 11 in 1982. In 2006, Northe completed a Certificate IV in Business. Political and parliamentary career With repetitive television advertising and campaigning on the issues of workers' rights and bicycle paths, Northe was able to capitalise on divisions within some local branches of the Labor Party to win the seat. Northe doubled the Nationals' primary vote, secured with the aid of Liberal Party and ex-Labor independent preferences. This win also served to help secure the Nationals' future as a political party in Victoria. Russell Northe joined fellow parliamentarians Peter Ryan and Peter Hall as the Nationals' state parliamentary representatives for Gippsland. At the 2010 state election, Northe achieved the biggest pro-Coalition swing in the state to transform Morwell into one of the National Party's safest Victorian seats, with a two-party-preferred margin of 16.29% against Labor. Northe won Morwell on the primary vote, polling 56.24% in his own right, and won every polling booth except the small Yallourn North booth, where Labor recorded a narrow majority. With the Liberal/Nationals Coalition winning government, Northe was also appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business. Northe has served on the Parliament's Rural and Regional Committee since 2007. In 2014, Northe was elevated to Cabinet as Minister for Energy and Resources and Minister for Small Business. He held those ministerial portfolios until the defeat of the Napthine/Ryan Coalition Government at the 2014 state election. After the election defeat and the resignation of long-serving Nationals leader Peter Ryan, Northe pursued the party deputy leadership, but lost to first-term MP Steph Ryan. On 28 August 2017, Northe resigned from the National Party due to stress, depression and gambling issues. According to media reports, he had accrued significant debts exceeding $750,000 owed to over thirty local businessmen, friends, constituents party members, and his own parliamentary leader Peter Walsh, partly due to gambling. Those who were persuaded by Northe to lend him money were said to include former employees in his electorate office and a retrenched power station worker who lost a large portion of his redundancy package.https://www.latrobevalleyexpress.com.au/story/5774179/im- fit-to-stand-northe/ His wife, Jenny Northe, expressed support for her husband's predicament and condemned the Nationals and Peter Walsh for engaging in hypocritical \\"gutter politics\\".https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-19/nationals-refer-alleged- forgery-to-victoria-police/9460618 Northe defied expectations and was re- elected in his seat at the 2018 state election, and pledged to be a \\"conservative independent\\" member.

Once the most ubiquitous locomotive in New South Wales, Australia, It is based on Alco frames and prime movers, using General Electric (later Associated Electrical Industries) electrical equipment. The South Australian Railways 830 and Silverton Rail 48s classes are of a very similar design. History The 48 Class were ordered to commence the conversion of branch lines to diesel traction with the first entering service in September 1959. Further orders saw 165 in service by October 1970. There were four versions: *Mark 1: 4801 ‚Äì 4845 *Mark 2: 4846 ‚Äì 4885 *Mark 3: 4886 - 48125 *Mark 4: 48126 ‚Äì 48165 The Mark 1s and Mark 2s can be distinguished from the others by their fuel tank, which incorporates the brake reservoir tanks on either side. As well as branch lines they operated both main line and metropolitan services on every line in the state. Aside from a couple written off after accidents in the mid-1980s, withdrawals didn't commence in earnest until August 1994.\\"48 Class\\" Railway Digest November 1994 page 32 In December 1994 the first Mark 1s were sold.\\"State Rail's Locomotive Auction Results\\" Railway Digest January 1995 page 36 By June 1997 FreightCorp's fleet was down to 120 units.\\"Motive Power Review - The 48 Class\\" Railway Digest June 1997 page 42 Others have been withdrawn since and as at January 2014, 66 remained in service primarily with Pacific National.

They were designed to operate in push-pull formation on intermodal container trains between Port Botany and Clyde/Yennora. PL1 and PL2 were transferred to South Australia after the sale of FreightCorp to Pacific National for use at Keswick Terminal shunting for Great Southern Rail which was prior a National Rail contract. PL2 was transferred back to NSW with PL1 remaining in South Australia. In NSW the class saw use on the former South Maitland Railway hauling coal along with 48 class locos. After a long period of storage at Kooragang Island, PL2, PL3, PL5, PL6 and PL7 were scrapped in 2013. PL4 was finally scrapped at Narrabri in late 2016 after being stored there for years. PL1 remains in service as a shunter at the Progress Rail workshops in Port Augusta. The PL class were the evolutionary link between the 48 class and the GT46C ACe locomotives, with the later sharing many similarities with their smaller ancestors.

It was created to control and divert the flow of local river and creek systems for the purpose of food production. The main river system feeding and fed by the area is the Murray River. Much of the water is supplied via the Mulwala Canal, flowing from Lake Mulwala. Water supply is provided by Murray Irrigation Limited, a company formed by the New South Wales government in 1995. Murray Irrigation purchases water directly from the New South Wales State Water Corporation. The system is regarded as a major engineering achievement comprising an elaborate series of weirs, canals and holding ponds (fed by upstream rivers and dams), including the large Lawson syphon where the Mulwala Canal flows under the Edward River. Anabranches of the Murray including the Edward River and the Wakool River are also managed to provide irrigation water to irrigators along those waterways. Managed flow along those waterways bears little correlation to natural flow regimes, with peak flows occurring during peak irrigation demand (summer) rather than during peak runoff (early spring). Irrigated agriculture is the main industry of the towns within the area which include Finley, Deniliquin and Jerilderie. The irrigation area has become increasingly controversial in the early 21st century, after consecutive years of drought and a growing Australian population have led to demands for greater levels of water conservation.

The Centieme was similar is size and shape to the existing Rendezvous crossover, but lower, wider, and marginally longer. Power came from an experimental 3.6 L twin-turbocharged V6 engine mated to the Hydra-Matic 4T65-E 4-speed transmission. The Centieme was designed to showcase the possible direction of Buick interior styling. The entire interior - including the six captain's chairs - was upholstered in leathers of various grains and colors, including a woven-leather floor. The gauge cluster used aluminum accents with olive ash wood inserts for the trim. The interior featured ambient lighting. The Bertone-designed exterior featured short front and rear overhangs, rode on 22-inch aluminum wheels, and was painted in Canyon Mist metallic tricoat.

The station broadcasts programs in English, Afrikaans and isiXhosa from Salt River, Cape Town on 89.5 MHz FM, with a music and talk format aimed at the 18 to 39 age group. Early life Bush Radio started out as a project of the Cassette Education Trust during the last stages of the struggle against apartheid.\\"Community radio in post-apartheid South Africa: The case of Bush Radio in Cape Town\\" . Transformations, February 2005. Its programmes were distributed on cassette tape. Many of its volunteers and programmers were students from the University of the Western Cape, which did not at the time have its own campus radio station.\\"The road to community radio\\". Rhodes Journalism Review, September 2004. After being denied broadcast licenses on two occasions by South Africa's broadcast regulator, the station launched as an illegal pirate radio station on April 25, 1993, but was shut down by authorities within a few hours. With the democratization of South Africa around the time of the 1994 elections, however, the station was soon granted a temporary broadcasting license, becoming one of the first media outlets in South Africa not owned by either the government or a commercial media company. Due to bureaucratic difficulties surrounding the country's transition to democracy, however, the station only received yearly temporary license renewals until being granted its first permanent broadcasting license in 2002. In its original incarnation, the station was led by Edric Gorfinkel. Once the station became a licensed operation, its management was taken over by Zane Ibrahim, who oversaw the station's transformation from an anti-apartheid activist project into a broader community-oriented broadcaster. Station volunteer Lumko Mtimde was also tapped to head the National Community Radio Forum, an organization which helped to establish a legislative and collaborative framework for the establishment and expansion of community radio in South Africa, and later became a member of South Africa's new broadcast regulator, the Independent Broadcasting Authority. In 2000 Bush Radio received one of the Prince Claus Awards in the theme \\"Urban Heroes\\". Services In addition to the radio service, Bush Radio also offers media training, multimedia and community development programs.

He was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. Best known as a fingerstyle guitarist, Tingstad has performed, recorded, and produced alternative country, blues, americana, rock, smooth jazz, ambient, and New-age music. Tingstad frequently collaborates with woodwinds player Nancy Rumbel as Tingstad and Rumbel. Background Eric Tingstad cites early rock and roll influences such as the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and King Crimson. Other influences include the Kingston Trio, Flatt and Scruggs, pianist and composer Martin Denny, sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, Mason Williams's \\"Classical Gas\\" and the Hawaiian slack-key guitar. In the mid 1970s, while playing lead guitar and bass with Seattle-based rock band Pegasus, Tingstad began studies under masters of techniques pioneered by Spanish classical guitarist and innovator Andr√©s Segovia. Those techniques, combined with innovations of his own, have shaped Tingstad's stylings and the instrumental compositions for which he is known. His innovative work inspired Will Ackerman, founder of Windham Hill Records, to create the Windham Hill Guitar Sampler series. Tingstad's Prelude from the Bridal Suite is a selected pick on AllMusic.com from the first Windham Hill Guitar Sampler. By a vote of his peers, he was honored in October 2006 with the Coyote Award from Arts Northwest commemorating his leadership, visibility, and contributions in live performance. He is also known for his philanthropic and community service work for historical preservation, land trust, and environmental issues which he has incorporated into his compositional themes and branding. Recordings Tingstad's solo recording career began in 1982 with the release of On the Links, eleven original songs in the then-burgeoning New Age genre. The album appeared on his private label, Cheshire Records, under which he continues to release albums of his own music and others. In 1985, he began a collaboration with woodwinds player Nancy Rumbel. Their debut album, The Gift, an acoustic Christmas collection, was very well received, selling ten thousand copies in the first ten weeks. The Gift went on to sell over half a million copies, and remains a best-selling Christmas album. In 1987 Tingstad signed a multi-album record contract with Narada Productions which led to 14 recordings from 1987 to 2004. The catalog is now owned and distributed worldwide by EMI Capitol. In 1988 Tingstad and Rumbel collaborated with pianist David Lanz to form the Woodlands trio, which resulted in a best-selling album called Woodlands. In 1998 the double album, American Acoustic was honored as \\"Acoustic Instrumental Album of the Year\\". It debuted at number one on Adult Contemporary charts and spent ten weeks on the Billboard radio charts. In 2000, Tingstad & Rumbel were invited to perform at Carnegie Hall. Tingstad won a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album in 2003 as artist, engineer, and producer of Tingstad and Rumbel's, Acoustic Garden. In 2007 Tingstad recorded Southwest, an instrumental album inspired by the landscapes of the American Southwest region featuring compositions in the style of what he falls \\"Ambient-Americana\\". He received a Grammy nomination for the recording Southwest recording. In 2012 he released his instrumental Americana recording Badlands, which includes an appearance by dobro and steel guitarist Cindy Cashdollar.

The AI figure for a given patient can range from zero to one, representing the proportion of the average speech signal that is audible. The closer the AI is to one, or 100 percent, the better the person should be able to hear speech. The calculation is also used in industrial settings for the design of safety devices, such as flight helmets, where audio signals are required to be clearly heard. Clinical use The AI is often used as a counseling tool since it presents an individual‚Äôs hearing loss in terms of percentage of speech missed during a typical one-on-one conversation. The AI can also be used to measure the effectiveness of hearing aids and other forms of amplification devices. Since the creation of the AI, there have been several proposed ways to simplify and increase its use. In 1990, Gustav Mueller and Mead Killion proposed an AI calculation involving one hundred dots on an audiogram, each of which represented an important speech frequency; the proportion of dots audible to the listener estimates the patient's AI. Unfortunately, not all areas on the audiogram (taking into account frequencies and intensity levels) are equally weighted. According to this procedure, the highest density of the audiogram dots is concentrated in the frequency region of 1-3 kHz, since this is the region containing the most speech information. Industrial use In many industrial settings noise exposure metrics have been established to quantify human exposure to sound. In aerospace settings the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII), published in 1986 by the American National Standards Institute, is a major revision of the AI standard and defines computational methods \\"that produce highly correlated with the intelligibility of speech under a variety of adverse listening conditions, such as noise masking, filtering and reverberation\\".

Its size tends to vary in accordance with locality, with the head and body length ranging from 7.5 to over , with some individuals exceeding 20cm. Coloration and patterning varies enormously between specimens from different locations, with shades of yellow and orange being perhaps the most common. Forms from arid climates are often a pale yellow in colour, while those from rainforest habitats typically exhibit dark green or blue coloration. Body proportion also varies with habitat; arid forms are typically very heavily built with proportionally short legs, while their tropical counterparts tend to have longer legs and a lighter build. Ethmostigmus rubripes also has three subspecies, with substantial variation within each. Habitat and range It is found in both dry and moist habitats, ranging from tropical rainforest to desert, usually in sheltered places such as under logs, leaf litter and bark, and beneath rocks. It is a solitary, terrestrial and nocturnal predator. It is widely distributed in Australia, where it exhibits the greatest variation, but is also found in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Indonesia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Diet E. rubripes is a voracious eater. Insects, snails, worms and even Arachnids are fair game for most individualshttp://australianmuseum.net.au/giant-centipede. Larger specimens are more than capable of subduing small vertebrates, which are overpowered by a combination of brute strength and the centipede's powerful venom. Reproduction The eggs are laid in clusters of roughly thirty, and the mother guards the eggs and hatchlings until after their second moult.http://australianmuseum.net.au/giant-centipede Venom The giant centipede has modified legs called forcipules attached to the first body segment, which curve around its head and can deliver venom into its prey. The venom is toxic to both mammals and insects, but does not appear to be strong enough to kill large animals quickly. It can cause severe pain in humans which can last for several days but which can be relieved somewhat by the application of icepacks. Some people report \\"intense pain\\", while others claim it is no worse than a wasp sting. There has been at least one reported death from the related centipede species Scolopendra subspinipes in which a young girl was bitten and died.

By the treaty, Charles was created Count of Beaumont-le-Roger and John made many concessions, but the peace he desired was not sustained.

The brownstone mined from these quarries was an important source for construction in the latter half of the 19th century. The stone from these quarries was used in a number of landmark buildings in Chicago, Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., New Haven, Connecticut, and Hartford. The site was listed as a National Historic Landmark, which also placed it on the National Register of Historic Places, on May 16, 2000.Dr. Joanne Kluessendorf (undated) , National Park Service and  Early history of the quarry  Quarrying on this site began in 1690 by James Stanclift, who contracted with the town of Middletown to build stonework in exchange for a deed of land. Commercial quarrying started in 1783 when the Brainerd Quarry Company began operations. During the peak of the brownstone era, more than 1500 workers were employed by the quarries, which shipped stone on their own ships for eight months out of the year. Proceeds from the quarrying business were deeded to Wesleyan University from 1833 through 1884, and stone from the quarries was used to build many campus buildings. As tastes in buildings shifted, and concrete became the material of choice, the demand for brownstone declined. A flood in 1936 and a hurricane in 1938 flooded the quarries, ending their operations. All efforts to drain the flooded quarries have been unsuccessful; one theory is that the floods opened some underground springs, making it impossible to effectively drain the quarries.  Current use of the quarry site  In 1994, a new operator, Connecticut Brownstone Quarries, began a small-scale quarrying operation to provide stone for restoration of brownstone buildings. The town purchased the historic quarries and of adjacent land in 1999 and 2000. A modern-day view of Brownstone Exploration and Discovery Park. The quarries have been leased for development as a recreation center and is currently being operated by Brownstone Exploration & Discovery Park, with the hope that awareness of the historic landmark will strengthen the local economy. Over the years the park has gradually expanded its attractions to include scuba diving, climbing and rappelling, swimming, snorkeling, canoeing and kayaking, hiking, mountain biking, wake boarding, cliff jumping, giant inflatable toys, and challenge courses for group team building. All activities are currently available except for the campground - which is currently under construction. There are also plans to offer educational programs at the site. Scuba diving is becoming a popular recreational use within the park, with divers coming from all over Connecticut and even some from out of state. Zip Lines Brownstone Park installed two zip lines that cut across the quarry in July 2007. The first line goes from the west side of the park to the peninsula at the center of the park. The second line travels south along the west side of the quarry. The lines are 750 and long respectively. For the 2010 season, the Park added another two zip lines, one of which is only accessible by climbing up a 65-foot rock wall. Water Slide Brownstone Park installed a water slide in July 2007. Water Toys A variety of water toys including kayaks, canoes, launchers, trampolines and windsurfers are available. Wake Boarding Several wake boarding lines are available, along with expert jumps and rails. Complimentary beginning lessons are included in the day pass.

It was an international award, aimed at a worldwide audience for an outstanding specific achievement in a selected area of science and technology promoting human welfare. It achieved widespread recognition by individuals and organisations throughout the world, receiving nominations from 18 countries. The Government awarded the Australia Prize to both Australian and international scientists. Of the 28 recipients, 18 were Australian, demonstrating Australia's strong international standing in many scientific fields.

The series was greenlighted after the network became interested in a series centered on wedding planners. The network approached David E. Kelley to create the show, and he essentially remade a rejected pilot he created for ABC in 2004 entitled DeMarco Affairs which starred Selma Blair, Lindsay Sloane, and Sabrina Lloyd as three sisters who inherit a wedding planner service. Though the show had a moderately strong premiere, it faded in the ratings and was cancelled after seven episodes had been produced and five episodes were aired. Plot The Bell sisters, Annie (KaDee Strickland), Jane (Teri Polo) and Sammy Bell (Sarah Jones), inherited \\"The Wedding Palace\\" after their parents' divorce. David Conlon (Michael Landes), photographer for The Wedding Palace and ex-boyfriend of Annie's whose tension-filled dealings with her are clearly the result of pent-up sexual chemistry; and Russell Hawkins (Benjamin King), Jane's husband and the company COO; round off the cast. Then there's wedding singer Ralph Snow (Chris Williams), who always aspired to be the next Lenny Kravitz, but instead is stuck crooning endless cover songs and retro medleys for unappreciative wedding guests. Amanda Pontell (Missi Pyle) adds to the frenzied scene as a former bridezilla client who becomes a board member of The Wedding Palace. =B-plots through the brief run of the series= * The relationship between Wedding Palace assistant Debbie (Sherri Shepherd) and another wedding singer (Cleavant Derricks in a recurring role). Her biological clock is ticking and he is cautious about getting married again, as his first marriage ended badly. * The very rich (but socially awkward) Amanda Pontell's efforts to fit in with the three Bell sisters. * Sammy Bell's (Sarah Jones) efforts to be seen as a whole woman, not just as a sexy woman. * Sibling rivalry between Jane (Teri Polo) and Annie (KaDee Strickland) -- there is a history of Jane's boyfriends becoming attracted to Annie‚Äîand Jane and Sammy‚ÄîSammy has read in Jane's diary that Jane is jealous of Sammy's breasts. * Had the series gone on, another secondary plot might have been about Russell's efforts to franchise the Wedding Palace. Christopher Rich played a potential investor with Las Vegas connections in the last aired episode. * A couple of episodes had Heather Tom and Nicholle Tom as buxom blonde sisters who would crash weddings. Debbie would inevitably throw them out. Cast *KaDee Strickland as Annie Bell *Teri Polo as Jane Bell *Sarah Jones as Sammy Bell *Michael Landes as David Conlon *Benjamin King as Russell Hawkins *Chris Williams as Ralph Snow *Missi Pyle as Amanda Pontell *Costas Mandylor as Ernesto *Sherri Shepherd as Debbie Quill Episodes Reception The first two episodes of The Wedding Bells garnered poor reviews and low ratings. Critics cited the superficial relationships between the sisters as a weakness. Some claim that Kelley lacked the flair to write for women, after his successful run with Ally McBeal.

Playing career  = Victoria Bushrangers = Cassell is a Fast Medium Bowler with a number of first class and one day appearances to his name. At 188 cm, he was considered a genuine future prospect for Victoria from an early age. Cassell was a highly touted youngster for the Victorian Bushrangers taking 4-33 in his first-class debut in 2002 against the Queensland Bulls. But injuries limited him to just a handful of First-Class and One-Day games. Cassell's performances in those early matches for the Bushrangers suggested potential, with 7 wickets (at an average of 22.71) in the Pura Cup and 4 wickets in the ING Cup at 22.50. Cassell played much of his early state cricket in the 2002-2003 season. Despite the Bushrangers baring through injury setbacks, 2006/07 proved a challenging season for Cassell. When frontline bowlers Shane Harwood, Allan Wise and Gerard Denton all found themselves injured throughout the season, but Cassell remained injured himself, it left the opportunity to Clinton McKay, Darren Pattinson and Grant Lindsay to make the step up to the state side. McKay and Pattison were both offered contracts in the place of Cassell due to injury and Brad Knowles. Cassell went through a period of two years where he couldn't play due to injury, spending time to recover physically and mentally to have another run at first-class cricket. Cassell went overseas believing he would never play cricket again but the urge returned when he found himself watching a Test on TV in a bar in Barcelona in 2008. In 2009 Cassell returned to cricket after remodelling his action (due to his legacy injuries) at the Centre of Excellence in Brisbane and played Premier Cricket for the Melbourne Cricket Club. He broke back into the Victorian team in late 2009 a successful return to first-class cricket in Australia. = South Australia Redbacks = In 2010 after a successful return to playing, Cassell made the tough decision to leave his home state Victoria, and move to South Australia to take up an offer with the South Australia Redbacks where he believed his bowling opportunities would be greater. This proved to be a smart decision with a number of outstanding performances with the Redbacks including a huge 6-53 off 16.1 overs in November 2010 against Queensland in a Sheffield Shield match. Cassell went on to successfully play for the Redbacks during the 2010 and 2011 seasons until his genetic back injuries cut his bowling career short again.  Coaching career  = South Australia Redbacks = Cassell took up a position with the Redbacks as a bowling coach helping the development of their upcoming talent. Cassell continued to coach with South Australia until 2017. Over the five years as a coach in South Australia, Cassell has helped leg-spinner Adam Zampa become a regular for Australia‚Äôs ODI and T20 sides, and has also worked closely with Joe Mennie who made his Test debut last season. Cassell quietly forged a reputation as a bowling guru in his time at the Adelaide Oval five years ago under former Redbacks head coach Darren Berry. Cassell helped transform interstate 'cast-offs' including Mennie and Daniel Worrall, while bringing the best out of homegrown favourites Chadd Sayers and Kane Richardson. = Ireland National Cricket Team = In 2017 Cassell left South Australia to take up an opportunity as Assistant Head Coach and National Fast Bowling Coach with the Ireland cricket team working under head coach Graham Ford. Ireland were in the process of admission to full International Cricket Council (ICC) status which was successfully granted.

The mine is now being considered by the NSW Department of Planning. It was previously rejected by the Keneally Government shortly before the 2011 State election. Proposal The exploration areas within which the mining proposal is situated were awarded to the Wyong Areas Coal Joint Venture by the NSW State Government in 1995 following a competitive tender. Extensive exploration drilling, geological surveys, environmental investigations, stakeholder consultations and other works costing approximately $80 million were undertaken by the proponents. The proposed mine would have an annual coal production of 4 to 5 million tonnes of export quality thermal coal per year, over 42 years. The associated coal loader, coal stockpile and rail link would be at least 3 kilometres away from one of the largest urban growth areas on the Central Coast, including the proposed Warnervale town centre.Private Member's Statement - Wallarah 2 Coal Project - 07/06/2007 Opposition and rejection of previous proposal The proposal was delayed by numerous studies, including an independent review headed by former NSW Liberal leader Kerry Chikarovski, and widespread opposition on the Central Coast with opponents suggesting the project could impact voting at subsequent elections.Voters' backlash looms against coal mine - Sydney Morning Herald, 4 January 2007 The Australian Coal Alliance was formed to oppose the project and has maintained an active public relations campaign against the proposal.

On the final day of the Keneally Government (the day before the issue of the writs), Minister Tony Kelly announced that the Government had made a decision that the proposal would not go ahead.

He was the son of music theorist and lutenist Vincenzo Galilei, and the younger brother of the scientist Galileo Galilei.  Life  Galilei was born in Florence. He learned to play the lute at an early age, like his father. Most likely he was destined for a career in Florence, but when his father died in 1591, the sixteen-year-old lutenist was put in the charge of his older brother Galileo Galilei, who was in Padua. Some other employment had to be found for Michelagnolo, so in 1593 he went to Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where foreign musicians were much in demand. Most likely he went there with the powerful Lithuanian Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had several sophisticated musical establishments at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries, especially at Krak√≥w: Luca Marenzio, one of Italy's most famous madrigal composers, went there for a time, as did lutenists Diomedes Cato and Valentin Bakfark. Lutenists were particularly in demand, and a considerable quantity of lute music was printed in Poland and Lithuania, in cities such as Krak√≥w, Gda≈Ñsk, Toru≈Ñ and Vilnius.Morawska, Grove Michelagnolo came back from Poland in 1599, in a second failed attempt to gain employment in Florence in the court of Grand Duke Ferdinando de' Medici, but returned in 1600 to his previous employer in Poland-Lithuania.Beier, Program Notes He stayed there until 1607, at which time he was hired by the Munich Hofkapelle of Duke Maximilian I. Munich had had one of the most progressive musical establishments in the region since the mid-16th century, having employed Orlande de Lassus; Galilei was another of many talented Italian musicians who went there to live and work. He remained in Munich for the rest of his life, fathering eight children, at least three of whom also became lutenists.Chauvel, Grove His relationship with his brother Galileo became especially difficult in his last years. Many of the letters between the two have been preserved; Michelagnolo ceaselessly implored his elder brother for money, and for help with his difficult children (Vincenzo, born in 1608, was particularly troublesome).  Music  Most of Galilei's music was for ten-course lute, and most was published in his first book, Il primo libro d'intavolatura di liuto (Munich, 1620), which used tablature notation. Some of his pieces appeared singly in other publications. His music consists of dances such as galliard, volta and corrente, grouped loosely into suites, organized by musical mode. Each suite is preceded by a toccata, and the book closes with two paired passamezzos and saltarellos. Stylistically they are written in the most modern manner of the time, with dissonances, ornaments, and functional tonal progressions indicative of the developing early Baroque style. His musical style was particularly influential in southern Germany, as shown by the demand for his music, even when he was still in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

According to the census, 40,218 persons are Assyrian, 21,166 identified themselves as having Chaldean ancestry.Kinarah: Chaldeans are not Assyrian but their own ethnicity and people.Twentieth Anniversary of Assyrian Australian Association 1989, Assyrian Australian Association, Edensor Park. Historically, Assyrian people were indigenous to their ancient ancestral Assyrian homeland that corresponds to modern-day northern Iraq, southeast Turkey northwestern fringes of Iran and, much recently, northeast Syria.Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century By Sargon Donabed The majority of Assyrian Australians have immigrated mainly from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Jordan and the Caucasus. Of the 61,418 Assyrians in Australia, 40,218 are members of the Assyrian Church of the East or Ancient Church of the East and 21,172 are members of the Chaldean Catholic Church. The City of Fairfield, in Sydney, has the most Assyrians in Australia, with 75% of Assyrians living in that area. 95% of Fairfield's Iraqi-born population are of Assyrian ancestry. Fairfield LGA also has one of the most predominant Assyrian communities in the diaspora, where one in every ten person would be Assyrian. Moreover, in contrast to other migrants, Assyrians have the highest rate of acquiring the Australian citizenship.Community Relations Commission For a Multicultural NSW 2004, Cultural Harmony. The Next Decade 2002‚Äì2012 (White Paper), New South Wales Government, Sydney South. During the 1980s war between Iraq and Iran, large numbers of Assyrians fled Iraq and applied for refugee status. In the early 2000s, 5% of Australia's humanitarian immigrants identified as being adherents of Syriac churches. In May 2013, the Assyrian genocide was recognised by the New South Wales state parliament. Assyrian-Australians have established various clubs, social organisation, churches and language schools. Representing only 0.13% of Australia's overall population, Assyrians are considered to be a successful minority group.Winter, I. 2000, Towards a theorized understanding of family life and social capital, Working paper No. 21, April, Australian Institute of family Studies, Melbourne History =Early immigration (1950s‚Äì1970s)= The first Assyrians arrived in Australia in the 1950s, to flee from the 1958 revolution in Iraq. By 1965, there were around five Assyrian families and a few individuals living in the Sydney suburbs of Randwick. Although around 80% of the arrivals lived in the suburbs of Fairfield LGA in Greater Western Sydney, some Assyrians settled in the eastern suburbs, a region on Sydney's coast. During that period 4,500 Assyrians came from Iraq, 2,500 from Iran and 1,000 from Syria and Lebanon. According to Dinkha Warda, Fairfield was the most popular settlement among Assyrians for reason as follows:Assyrian Australian Association & Ettinger House 1997, Settlement Issues of the Assyrian Community, AAA, Sydney. > Back in 1966, a small meeting was held between the early settlers to decide > the future of Assyrians in this country...In 1966, Fairfield's developed > area went west up to the Cumberland Highway. The majority of those attending > the meeting agreed to establish the Assyrian community in Fairfield. The > reason was to centralise the development of all the Assyrian social, > religious and sporting activities, allowing greater access and > participation. If we remained in the Sydney city area, we would have > scattered. And so, four or five families purchased fibro houses in Fairfield > (including myself), and a few bought blocks of land. In 1969, following the settlement of Assyrians in the Fairfield area, the Assyrian Australian Association (AAA) was formed. The significance of the AAA is based primarily on the fact that it was the first registered Assyrian organisation in Australia. Prior to AAA, there had existed an unofficial club called the Assyrian Australian Club which was established in 1966 and initially based for the Assyrians residing in the Eastern suburbs of Sydney prior to the move to the Fairfield area. The Assyrian Australian Club was replaced with the Assyrian Sports and Cultural Club in 1972, the second official Assyrian secular organisation to be registered in NSW after the AAA. After a brief period of inactivity, the Assyrian Sports and Cultural Club was relocated to the Fairfield area after many Assyrians moved during the housing boom in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, where it has remained active since. In the 1970s, a few soccer clubs were established as the Assyrian community began to have a prominence. An Assyrian language school was formed in 1974, thanks to the AAA. =Community growth (1980s‚Äì2000s)= Nineveh Club in Smithfield Rd, Edensor Park, is the largest Assyrian club in the country. In 1980, Nineveh Club, a prominent Assyrian club in Edensor Park, Sydney, was established. Built with artificial mud brick, the Club was designed after Assyrian royal palace in Nineveh. The entryway features two winged bull statues containing the body of a lion, the head of an Assyrian king and wings of an eagle. In the late 1980s, the The Church of the East was controversially split ‚Äì The Church of the East in Australia from that time on now has two denominations; The 'old' (Ancient Church of the East) and the 'new' (Assyrian Church of the East). The billboard of St Narsai Assyrian College. As the Assyrian community grew in the late 1980s, the Assyrian Sports and Cultural Club leased its premises from 1990 onwards, in Fairfield Heights, Sydney and acquired liquor and gaming licenses. The club later purchased its current building in 1997, and it was officially opened in 2000. Currently, it is the only Assyrian club in operation after the closure of the Nineveh Club in 2008. The club co-hosted sports events such as The Assyrian Cup soccer tournaments and held functions and activities for the community. It has also supported migrants, who arrived in the 1990s, settle in the country and it encouraged education by aiding achievers in the high school certificate. During the late 1990s, there was an increased level of Assyrian migration to Australia under the family reunion, refugee and humanitarian programs. Reportedly, around 903 Assyrian arrivals were allowed under the Australian Government's Special Humanitarian Program and the Family Reunion Program.2004, Australia's Support for Humanitarian Entrants 2003‚Äì04, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra. In 1997, it was reported that, for the Assyrian youth, lack of English skills was the major impediment for gaining employment, school achievement and becoming socially manoeuvrable in the Australian society. For instance, some Fairfield High School Assyrians wanted to go to university but felt hopeless because of their poor English. As such, several Assyrian churches developed a number of youth programs. For Assyrians with a higher education, the problem was also language and unacceptability of overseas qualifications, which prevented them from pursuing their careers. The opening of St Hurmizd Assyrian Primary School in 2002, in Sydney, was the first school from the ACOE that was established in the international diaspora. In 2006, also in Sydney, St. Narsai Assyrian Christian College was established. It was the first ACOE high school to be built in the western world. =Post-Iraqi war (2010s‚Äìpresent)= Assyrian Australians protesting against the Genocide of Christians by ISIL in Sydney, 2014. On August 2010, a memorial monument for the Assyrian genocide was erected in Bonnyrigg. The statue, being 4.5 meters tall, is designed as a hand of a martyr draped in an Assyrian flag. The memorial is placed in a reserve to be named the Garden of Nineveh. The statue and the name for the reserve were proposed in August 2009. After consultation with the community, Fairfield Council received more than 100 submissions, including some from overseas, and two petitions. The proposal was condemned by the Turkish community. Turkey's consul general to Sydney expressed resentment about the monument, while acknowledging that tragedies had occurred to Assyrians in the period as well as Turks. On August 2014, more than 6,000 Assyrians marched in Belmore Park in Sydney CBD to protest against the treatment of their Assyrian counterparts in Iraq and Syria by ISIL. Many wore T-shirts reading the hashtag #WeAreN, and chanted \\"we want peace, we want justice\\" and \\"save our Christians\\". They also waved posters, which read \\"stop genocide against our Christians\\" and \\"Stop crimes against humanity\\". They marched in Elizabeth Street, through the city to Martin Place. Assyrian Community leaders made passionate speeches soliciting the Australian and other international governments to help those being persecuted in the Middle East. In 2015, the Abbott government announced that 12,000 extra humanitarian visas would be given to persecuted groups in the war-torn Middle Eastern countries. The Department of Social Services confirmed that 11,400 Iraqi and Syrian refugees (many of whom being Assyrian) were admitted to Australia as part of its one-off humanitarian intake, where they would primarily settle in Fairfield and Liverpool. The Assyrians told SBS World News they were in an unswerving state of despair, as they hoped more and more of their kin from the Middle East were brought to the country. Carmen Lazar, manager of the Assyrian Resource Centre, said, \\"If they can just lend another hand, you know, give us another 12,000 intake, just to release that pressure from what's happening overseas\\".

According to the 2016 census, they are 311 Assyrians living in Brisbane which has almost doubled from the 2011 census. 407 Iraqis according to the 2016 census in Brisbane identified as Christian. =General statistics= In the 1996 census, there were 9571 people who spoke Assyrian in the state of NSW, and 2191 in Victoria. 60% of these Assyrians were born in Iraq, 21% in Australia and 13% in Iran. Also in that time, 54% belong to the Assyrian Church of the East, 27% belonged to the Chaldean Catholic Church and 7% to the Orthodox church. In the 2001 census, 9,520 Fairfield LGA residents stated they were of Assyrian ancestry and 8,879 residents stated they spoke Assyrian at home. The Assyrian-speakers living in NSW were 13,241 at that time.

Whilst the new arrivals are settling in Fairfield CBD and Fairfield Heights, the pre-mid-1990s arrivals have purchased and/or rented houses in the more affluent suburbs of Fairfield City, such as, Bossley Park, Wetherill Park and Greenfield Park, which are around west from Fairfield CBD. Furthermore, some of the recently arrived Assyrian children have had psychological trauma for the experiences in their countries of origin, which encroached their settlement in Australia.Newton, K. 1997, 'Social capital and democracy', American Behavioural Scientist, vol. 40, no. 5, pp. 575‚Äì86 Culture Saint Thomas Chaldean & Assyrian Catholic Cathedral, built in 2006.

Assyrians, depending on the village/town they belong to commemorate their specific patron saints and celebrate it usually with their families at picnics or halls. For example, the Assyrians from the Batnaya town commemorate Mar Oraha. The feast of Mar Oraha is partaken in an annual prayer and celebration. Celebrations include traditional Assyrian dancing with Assyrian singers, food and people wearing traditional Assyrian clothing from Batnaya. Assyrians from Alqosh commemorate Mar Mikha, who was one of the holy fathers of Alqosh. Alqoshnaye celebrate the Feast of Mar Mikha, known as 'Shara'd Mar Mikha' around the world. This event is celebrated through picnics or halls, like many other Shereh (Feasts). The 'St. Hirmized' group is an Alqosh association of Sydney which organises events which relate to their town. People from Alqosh, like many other Assyrian towns/villages wear their traditional clothing at these events which commemorate their patron saints and celebrate the history of their towns. Some ACOE adherents in Sydney annually commemorate Saint Zaia (Shara 'D Mar Zaia) at Blaxland Crossing Reserve in the suburb of Wallacia on September. Hundreds attend the occasion, including Assyrian singers who perform for the event. Visitors would generally picnic, barbecue or relax in the Australian bush, and they would usually participate in Assyrian folk dance. This is the second largest Assyrian social gathering in Sydney after the New Year celebration in Fairfield Showground.Zinda Magazine Both Nineveh Club and Assyrian Sports and Cultural Club support and showcase local Assyrian talents, such as singers, actors, musicians, painters and sculptors. The clubs contain reception halls and they usually host singer concerts (including lounge singers), festive parties, weddings, theatrical plays and other forms of social entertainment for the Assyrians in Sydney.Gorgees, P. 2003, 'The Assyrian Community's Continued Needs in the Fairfield LGA', in Checking the Pulse of Fairfield‚ÄïConference Report, Fairfield Migrant Resource Centre, Cabramatta. The annually held Assyrian New Year festival in Sydney, Australia. The Assyrians in Sydney lavishly celebrate the Assyrian New Year annually on 1 April, in Fairfield Showground in Prairiewood. Thousands attend the New Year festival and it usually features music and theatrical performances, traditional dancers, food stalls and fireworks. Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott and other politicians such as Chris Bowen, Craig Kelly, Tanya Plibersek, Chris Hayes and former NSW premier Bob Carr have attended the festival and made a speech. Fairfield's large Assyrian community has had the media describe the suburb as 'Little Iraq' or 'Little Assyria'. Assyrian businesses have opened in Fairfield, mostly in Ware Street and Smart Street, and in Fairfield Heights in The Boulevarde. These businesses include everything from jewellery shops to restaurants and convenient stores, making the area favourite entertainment and shopping hot spot for the Assyrian community. =Church split controversy= In 1987, there was a major church split in the Church of the East in Fairfield, which shook and divided the community. The notorious event resulted in legal proceedings over property rights and it even received national media coverage. After the Supreme Court of New South Wales ruled in favour of bishop Mar Meelis Zaia, the Assyrian Church of the East diocese of Australia and New Zealand, to take ownership of St Mary's Church, Assyrians of the Ancient Church of the East sect protested since they found the court's ruling highly objectionable and unjust, as their sect claimed the St Mary's Church beforehand. A few of them eventually got involved in a frantic brawl outside the courthouse with those part of the Assyrian Church of the East sect. Richard Carleton from 60 minutes covered the story in a studio that contained around 200 Assyrians who opposed the Bishop. Carleton belligerently faced the few men who were involved in the brawl and asked if they were apologetic about their actions, which the men stated they were merely acting in \\"self-defense\\" and \\"fighting for their rights\\" (as the court neglected their perspective). The Bishop described the actions of his raucous opponents as \\"primitive\\". Author and journalist David Leser criticised the 60 Minutes portrayal of Assyrians in his book The Whites of Their Eyes, saying, \\"12 minutes of prime- time baiting of a community that had been law-abiding and peaceful prior to and subsequent to that event. There was no one millisecond devoted to explaining the intricacies of the dispute\\".The Whites of Their Eyes: Profiles by David Leser, published by Allen & Unwin, 1999 =Sport= Assyrian Australians, like many other Assyrians from around the world, are mainly fond of soccer, and have established various football clubs in Australia. Fairfield Bulls Soccer Club, based in Sydney, is the most prominent soccer club in the country. It was established in 1971 and it has involved hundreds of children and teenagers in different age teams. Legislated by Football NSW, Fairfield Bulls became a standalone club in 2005. The Soccer Club was linked with Nineveh Sports and Community Club. Another conspicuous Assyrian soccer club in Sydney, established in the early 1970s, is the Nineveh Eagles.Stewart Weeks, M. and Richardson, C. 1998, Social Capital Stories, Centre for Independent Studies, Sydney. In Melbourne, two Assyrian soccer teams exist, being; Moreland United FC and Upfield FC. Many Assyrian people cheer for their teams, local and international. The teams include the Assyriska FF, as well as the Iraqi and Syrian national teams. Sydney's Assyrian community assembled in Fairfield to celebrate Iraq qualifying for the Asian Football Cup finals in 2007. More than 7000 people, including Iraqi Arabs, joined in street celebrations around Fairfield on Sunday 29 July 2007 after Iraq won the Asian Cup finals.Giorgas, D. 2000, 'Community Formation and Social Capital in Australia', paper delivered to the 7th Australian Institute of Family Studies Conference, Darling Harbour, Sydney, 25 July. Media Most Assyrian- Australian media is aired on the radio. Assyrian radio has a variety of themes and topics which consist mainly of Assyrian music and interviews with prominent Assyrian individuals, and politics, current events, weather, sport and history. These subjects are usually affiliated with Assyrian people, their culture and homeland. In the late 90s through to 2004, channel 31, a community channel, broadcast in Assyrian one to three hours a week. =Radio= *SBS Radio, which airs in Sydney and Melbourne, broadcasts in the Assyrian language every Saturday and Tuesday evenings from 8 pm to 9 pm. *2000FM, a Sydney radio station, airs in the Assyrian language every Monday mornings for three hours, on the frequency of 98.5 FM. *2GLF, a community radio station in Sydney's suburb of Liverpool, on the frequency of 89.3 FM, broadcasts a number of Assyrian shows.

Aired on CBC Television in English and on Radio-Canada in French and released to mark the tenth anniversary of the 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum, the film explored the dynamics of the referendum campaign through interviews with and news clips of several of the major players on both sides of the debate.Rabble.caCBC The two-part film aired on SRC in September 2005, and on CBC in October. It has also been released on DVD.  Synopsis  The two-part documentary focuses on the battle between the Federalist camp lead by Jean Chr√©tien representing the \\"No-side\\" vote regarding Quebec Sovereignty as they go against the \\"Yes-side\\", led by Lucien Bouchard and Jacques Parizeau promoting a sovereignty society separate from Canada.  Film Content  Part-one of the CBC Documentary Breaking Point goes behind the scenes of the 1995 Quebec Referendum. The documentary outlines the Quebec sovereigntist campaign after they were defeated by the Federalist in the 1980 referendum. Part-one highlights the successes and struggles of the Quebec Sovereignty movement as Jacques Parizeau, former Premier of Quebec who led the 1980 Quebec Referendum, had been forced to hand the initially struggling 'Yes camp' to the more-popular Lucien Bouchard, member of the Bloc Quebecois. In this, the documentary shows the struggles of Quebec trying to obtain outside support from other countries such as; United States and France. Support inside their province becomes a challenge as groups such as; James Bay Cree and French-Canadians are skeptic regarding what the future would look like in the absence of Canada. Part-two focuses on the head-to-head battle between Jean Chretien and Lucien Bouchard as both leaders campaign to their supporter's weeks before the 1995 referendum vote. In Part two, the United States showed their support for Chretien's Federalist campaign and the James Bay Cree hold a referendum deciding whether they want to separate from Canada alongside Quebec. Ultimately, Jean Chretien and Lucien Bouchard are left to give their final speeches before fate is determined on October 30, 1995 as the population of Quebec vote to decide whether they should separate, or remain a part of Canada. = The \\"No-side\\" = Known as the Federalist camp voting \\"No\\" to Quebec Sovereignty in the 1995 referendum led by Jean Chretien and the Quebec Liberal Party. = The \\"Yes-side\\" = Consisted of the individuals of the Quebec population in favor of separating from Canada. This campaign was led by Jacques Parizeau and Lucien Bouchard promoting the \\"Yes-side\\" campaign.  James Bay Cree Referendum  The James Bay Cree held a referendum to decide if their territory should remain a part of Canada should Qu√©bec vote to separate in its own forthcoming referendum. This three-day referendum was a result of the First Nations of James Bay Cree \\"who are requesting the same recognition\\" like Quebec for a distinct society during the Quebec referendum years. They do this because they are worried about what the future holds if Quebec separates from Canada. CBC Documentary Breaking Point highlights that the \\"Cree is determined to have their own referendum and they intend to be the masters of their own future\\". The referendum is based on one question, \\"Do you consent the government of Quebec separates the James Bay Cree and create traditional territory from Canada in the event of a yes vote in the Quebec referendum?\\" This situation put Canada in a difficult position because they now have to vote on Quebec and James Bay Cree. Once the votes were polled, 77% of the eligible members of the Cree ended up voting and the majority vote was to stay with Canada.  1995 Quebec Referendum  Following the 1980 Quebec Referendum, the 1995 Quebec referendum was the second time that Canadian French-speaking individuals would vote whether the province of Quebec would declare national sovereignty and become an independent country or continue to be a cooperative partner as a province within Canadian borders.

Theory  Leaders who are weakened domestically often undertake risky policies to avoid undesirable developments for them personally. The fear of removal from office due to poor performance or bad luck may prompt a leader to instigate a diversionary war he or she might not rationally have started, in the hope that should it go well he or she would stay in power, or at least receiving a surge in personal popularity and patriotism to sustain them in power. Gambling for resurrection can also consist of a leader prolonging an existing war that should rationally be ended, fearing removal from office or punishment (imprisonment, exile, or death) . The leader thus continues the war against the country's interest, adopting risky military strategies in the hope of a dramatic reversal of fortune in the war's outcome. In this situation, escalation is more attractive than peace because the losses are below the removal threshold for the leader's constituency. Once the constituency seem determined to remove the leader from office, it has no other sanction to apply to the leader. The executive, then, has nothing to risk in further escalation, but may win his right to stay in office should the gamble be successful. Examples It is seldom possible to provide conclusive proof that a leader's decision to go to war or prolong war is motivated by personal or domestic political issues. However, some conflicts may be seen as Gambles for Resurrection, including: * The Argentinian invasion of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands, which was seen as a distraction from President Leopoldo Galtieri's domestic problems, and an attempt to unify the country in its territorial claim over the islands. After her victory in the conflict Margaret Thatcher called a Khaki election in the UK, winning decisively, and Galtieri was ousted the same year. *President Bill Clinton was involved in a sex scandal and started three military strikes in 1998 against Iraq, targets in the Sudan and Afghanistan, and Serbia in the heat of the scandal. This followed just three months after the release of the film \\"Wag the dog\\" (see below), and apparently mirrored the film's theme. *Adolf Hitler refused to surrender at the end of the Second World War, when defeat was inevitable and surrender was in the best interests of Germany. His suicide may be seen as an attempt to preserve his historical reputation, though his mental state is uncertain. Pop culture influence Gambling for resurrection is often referred to in the mainstream media as \\"Wag the dog,\\" a reference to a 1997 film by the same name in which a fictional President of the United States starts a fake diversionary war to distract the American public from a sex scandal.

The kofun is believed to be the tomb of Soga no Umako. It occupies a space of , and is the largest known megalithic structure in Japan. The kofun is also known as the Kofun.  Name  The name of the kofun in Japanese is a combination of two words, the first, , meaning \\"stone\\", and the second, , meaning \\"stage\\". The name of the kofun therefore originates in its resemblance to a large stone stage. The Ishibutai Kofun has been known by this name at least as early as the Tokugawa period, as evidenced by its entry in the Saigoku sanj≈´sansho meisho zue, a large guide to Buddhist pilgrimage sites written by Kanenari Akatsuki in 1853.  Association with Soga no Umako  The Ishibutai Kofun is inferred to be the tomb of Soga no Umako (559? - 626), and his death during the reign of Empress Suiko is recorded in the \\"Nihon shoki\\". :Summer, 5th month, 20th day. The Oho-omi died. He was buried in the tomb at Momohama. The historian and archeologist Sadakichi Kita (1871 - 1939) proposed that the Ishibutai Kofun is the above-mentioned \\"Momohana\\" tomb in the 'Nihon shoki. Kita also proposed that the earthen mound of the Ishibutai Kofun was removed after Soga no Umako's death as a punishment of the Soga clan by the imperial government.  Structure  Stone entrance of the Ishibutai Kofun The Ishibutai Kofun was built on a spur of a mountain that falls northeast to a small plateau. It consists of a platform, a gallery entryway, stone walls that form a tomb, two large stones that form a ceiling for the tomb, and embankments on either side of the tomb. In total 30 stones were used to construct the Ishibutai Kofun. The large granite megaliths come from Mount T≈çnomine, which is approximately from the site. = Platform and moat = The Ishibutai Kofun originally occupied a much larger area than is evidenced by the existing stone tumulus. It was built on a square platform, which measured on each side at the time of construction. Archeological excavations have revealed that the kofun was surrounded by a moat, a feature typical of other kofun of the period. This moat is estimated to be wide. In total the kofun, platform, and moat probably covered an area long. = Approach = Kofun typically had a stone approach to the entrance path of the tomb. The Ishibutai has a particularly long entrance path, which measures . A shallow drainage channel long and wide runs the length of the entrance path. This entrance was originally covered like the tomb, but its stone ceiling no longer exists. = Tomb = The Ishibutai Kofun is a corridor-type tomb. The inner chamber is long, wide, and high. It consists of 30 stones, by and . Small drainage channels run along the east, north, and west of the tomb. These were constructed to drain water collects on the north side of the tomb to feed south into the shallow drainage channel in the kofun entry. = Ceiling = The Ishibutai Kofun is especially noted for the megaliths that form the ceiling of the tomb. The ceiling of the tomb is formed by two megaliths, one to the north and one to the south. The megalith at the north of the tomb weighs approximately , and the larger stone to the south weighs approximately . = Mound = The Ishibutai Kofun was originally a large, flat type kofun; the existing stone structure was covered at the time of construction by a broad, flat earthen mound. This mound eroded slowly after the construction of the kofun, thus exposing the large megaliths of the tomb roof.  Excavation  Ishibutai Kofun The Ishibutai Kofun was first excavated by the archaeologist and academic K≈çsaku Hamada (1881Ôºç1938). Imperial kofun have not been readily excavated in Japan. Due to its association with Soga no Umako, the Ishibutai tumulus does not have an imperial designation, and has thus seen extensive excavation. The kofun was first excavated in 1933, work on the base and moat began in 1935, and excavation of the tomb continued until 1975. The Ishibutai Kofun excavation yielded no significant finds. Funerary objects were probably lost to grave robbery quite soon after its construction. Stone shards to the southeast of the tomb are the remains of a tuff sarcophagus. Numerous examples of gilt and bronze implements, as well as earthenware shards were found in the banks of the tomb approach. The excavation also revealed that other similar flat stone kofun were built to the north and south of the existing structure. The Ishibutai Kofun was designated a historical remain in 1935. In 1954 the kofun was fully designated as a , one of only 75 sites in Japan with this designation. As excavation of the Ishibutai Kofun continued after World War II, significant reconstruction of areas around the kofun were carried out. The kofun and its surrounding area is part of the Asuka Historical National Government Park.

He is also a writer, entrepreneur, inventor, and interface designer. He is the son of human-computer interface expert and initiator of the Macintosh project at Apple, Jef Raskin. As an advocate for the ethical use of technology, Raskin is critical of the effects that modern technology has on everyday lives and society. Along with Tristan Harris, Raskin has extensively talked about the powers and potential dangers that technology poses to modern society in the podcast Your Undivided Attention. In 2019, he became a member of the World Economic Forum's Global AI Council. Raskin also coined the phrase \\"freedom of speech is not freedom of reach,\\" which was the title of an article that he wrote with Renee Diresta. \\"Freedom of speech is not freedom of reach\\" has become a defining term to understand the large scale implications of platform amplification and free speech. The phrase has been publicly quoted by comedian Sacha Baron Cohen and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey when banning political advertisements on Twitter. Raskin has been noted for continuing his father's work in project Archy, for working as head of user experience at Mozilla Labs and lead designer for Firefox, and for founding various start-up companies. Raskin is also known for inventing the infinite scroll. More recently, he has collaborated on virtual reality projects and zooming user interface (ZUI).makespace.fun Career =Personal projects= Aza Raskin gave his first talk on user interfaces at age 10 at the local San Francisco chapter of SIGCHI. He holds bachelor's degrees in mathematics and physics from the University of Chicago. In 2004, he worked with his father Jef Raskin at the Raskin Center for Humane Interfaces on Archy, a user interface paradigm. The next year, he founded Humanized Inc. to continue work on the Archy paradigm. At Humanized, he created the language- based service-oriented Enso software.humanized.com/enso December 28, 2011 During the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, Raskin mobilized with a group of other entrepreneurs (including Joshua Rosen, the art director of Steven Spielberg's movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence), to create a crowdsourced website to turn real-time information streams into meaningful map data, used by several major non-governmental organizations helping on the ground in Haiti hosted at Haiti.com. Raskin is an active phishing researcher, best known for discovering the tabnabbing attack. The attack takes advantage of open browser tabs to launch phishing sites without the user's knowledge. He has a number of smaller projects like Algorithm Ink (based on Context Free) which generates art from a formal grammar. Raskin advocated for iterative governance in the Rebooting Britain series of Wired UK magazine, and was also on its cover. He has also given a TED talk about new humane directions for computing. =Mozilla Corporation= In 2008, Humanized employees including Raskin were part of a hire-out by the Mozilla Corporation. In 2010, Raskin was appointed Creative Lead for Firefox, having previously been head of user experience at Mozilla Labs. He has worked on several labs projects including Ubiquity, Firefox for mobile, and wrote the original specification for the Geolocation API. In 2010, Raskin introduced the results of his work on the Firefox team at Mozilla: Tab Candy. Organizing tabs spatially, Tab Candy allowed the user to \\"organize browsing, to see all of our tabs at once, and focus on the task at hand\\". Tab Candy's initial design and alpha release has been called \\"the best new browser feature since tabs were invented\\" by Computerworld. Tab Candy was later renamed Firefox Panorama and hidden by default in the initial Firefox 4 release. Panorama was moved to an add-on and removed from Firefox. =Startups= Raskin has founded two other companies besides Humanized, including Songza, a music meta-search tool, and Bloxes, which sold furniture made out of cardboard. Songza was acquired in late 2008 by Amazon-backed Amie Street. Songza was eventually bought by Google and now powers much of Google Play. Songza was also responsible for mood and activity- based playlists. By the end of 2010, Raskin announced he had left Mozilla to begin a health-related venture at the Massive Health startup, with the goal to apply design principles to the problem of being healthy. In 2011, he received the Master of Design award from Fast Company for his work as co-founder of Massive Health. On April 16, 2012, Massive Health announced that Raskin would lead the company as Chief Vision Officer. Massive Health was acquired by Jawbone in 2013. =Earth Species Project= In 2017, Raskin founded the Earth Species Project, an open-source collaborative and nonprofit dedicated to decoding animal communication that launched with an NPR Invisibilia podcast in 2020. Opinions on technology use As one of the co-founders of the Center for Humane Technology, Raskin has been an advocate for the ethical use of technology, and is critical of the effects that modern technology has on everyday lives and society. He has also given talks on the far-reaching and often negative effects of modern technology use for Wired magazine and The Wall Street Journal, as well as Bits & Pretzels, Slush, Humanity 2.0, and Laurie Segall. In 2019, Raskin became a member of the World Economic Forum's Global AI Council. Media and other activities Raskin was featured on the cover of Off Screen magazine in 2018.

It stretched from Manchester (now part of Richmond's Southside) west to Falling Creek near Midlothian, and is now known as Midlothian Turnpike, mostly forming part of U.S. Route 60 (US 60). In the early 1700s, coal was first discovered in central Virginia by Huguenot settlers. Initially, the coal was mined for personal use, but as time went on, coal became a relatively large commercial business. By the end of the 18th century, Chesterfield coal was being shipped to ports all across the eastern coast of the United States. However, with the increased coal exports, the road upon which it was carted off to the port at Manchester, known as the Buckingham road, became deeply rutted by the heavy coal wagons. These ruts were a nuisance for farmers carting their produce and general travelers as well as the coal mine owners, whose wagons got stuck. By 1802, the problem became so severe that several of Chesterfield County's coal manufacturers and residents petitioned the Virginia General Assembly for permission to construct a turnpike between the port of Manchester and Falling Creek, where the coal mines were scattered around. To remedy this, a turnpike company was incorporated by an act of the Virginia legislature on January 20, 1802. This company, called the Manchester Turnpike Company, was capitalized at $40,000 and \\"under the management of Benjamin Hatcher, Henry L. Biscoe, Cornelius Buck, Henry Heath, Andrew Nicholson, William Robertson, and John Cunliffe.\\" Additionally, two toll booths were to be built at either end of the turnpike: one at the \\"junction between the Falling creek church road and the Buckingham road\\" and the other at the \\"junction between the Westham road, and the said Buckingham road.\\" The toll rates were as follows: 25¬¢ for a loaded coal wagon, 6¬¢ per wheel of a regular farm wagon or carriage, and 3¬¢ for each horse traveling without a cart, wagon, or carriage. The improved road was opened to coal wagons and general travelers in 1807. For about 20 years, the Manchester Turnpike had a virtual monopoly on the transportation of Chesterfield coal and many coal mine owners became very frustrated with it because at times, the price of coal would go down but the toll would not, thereby ensuring less profit for the colliers. In 1828, a new mode of transportation materialized. On February 27 of that year, the Chesterfield Railroad Company received a charter from the General Assembly to build a railroad parallel to the Manchester Turnpike. By 1831, the 13 mile road was completed and effectively put the turnpike out of business. The Manchester Turnpike served its purpose of transporting coal until a larger and better way came along. Although the turnpike did not haul coal after the early 1830s, it still carried people traveling on the Buckingham road to Manchester and across the river to Richmond. Eventually the toll booths became discontinued and in the 1920s, the road was straightened in many places. Today Midlothian Turnpike roughly follows the route of the old Manchester Turnpike except near the western end where the old road is now known as Old Buckingham Road.

After the war, the ship was used as a floating exhibition hall for the 1951 Festival of Britain and as the command ship for the 1952 Operation Hurricane, the test of the prototype British atomic bomb. She was built at Harland & Wolff shipyards in Belfast, Northern Ireland. When construction started in 1941 she was intended as a refrigerated cargo ship for transporting lamb and mutton from New Zealand, but was requisitioned by the British Government during construction and completed and launched as an escort carrier, entering service in early 1944. The ship was of a similar, but not identical design to the other ships of the . Second World War Campania in June 1944. Campania operated escorting convoys and doing anti-submarine work in the Atlantic and Arctic theatres. In December 1944, her Swordfish aircraft from a detachment of 813 Squadron sank the German submarine U-365 while the Campania was escorting the Arctic convoy Convoy RA-62. The ship survived the war, and unlike other Royal Navy escort carriers, was not immediately scrapped or sold. She was briefly used as an aircraft transport before being decommissioned and placed in reserve in December 1945. Festival of Britain Campania in Festival Dress at Plymouth Docks. In 1951, she was the Festival of Britain's exhibition ship, touring the country's ports with a civilian crew as the Festival Ship Campania to supplement the main exhibition in London and two thousand local events. The Festival Office's resident designer, James Holland, considered that the vessel would \\"not convert easily into a showboat\\", but with the massive demand for shipping to help rebuild Europe after the war, he and his colleagues felt lucky to have any ship at all. Repainted white, the ship was decorated with skeleton masts and bunting. Officially named the Sea Travelling Exhibition, the exhibits were intended to reflect the main London Exhibition. Like the Festival's Land Travelling Exhibition, they were divided into three sections, the \\"Land of Britain\\", \\"Discovery\\" and \\"The People at Home\\". Between 4 May 1951 and 6 October, the ship visited Southampton, Dundee, Newcastle, Hull, Plymouth, Bristol, Cardiff, Belfast, Birkenhead and Glasgow, staying at each port for 10‚Äì14 days. Operation Hurricane With the festival over, the ship was refitted in Birkenhead for a very different role, as the command ship for Operation Hurricane, the test of the first British atomic bomb on the Monte Bello Islands off western Australia. The refit saw the exhibition replaced by workshops, laboratories, offices and cabins, plus a desalination plant since the Monte Bello Islands did not have any indigenous fresh water source to supply the 1500 personnel who would take part in the test. Four other ships were directly involved in the test, the landing ships Narvik, Zeebrugge, Tracker and the frigate, Plym. Tracker was designated as the health ship and extensively equipped with decontamination facilities, whilst the weapon was to be detonated aboard Plym. The flotilla was under the overall command of Rear Admiral Arthur David Torlesse. Heavily laden with crated equipment and deck cargo, including three Westland Dragonfly helicopters and two Sea Otter aircraft and deck cargo, the re-commissioned Campania departed from Portsmouth for the islands on 2 June 1952. Eighty-five scientists were also on board as passengers, around half directly involved in British nuclear programme and the remainder from other parts of the British civil service. The vessel arrived at the Monte Bello Islands on 8 August after calling into Gibraltar, Cape Town, Mauritius and Fremantle and the next two months were spent preparing for the test, which took place on 3 October. Campania was not found to be particularly suitable as the main base for the test, partly because it was hot and cramped, and partly because there were insufficient boats for ferrying them between the ship and the shore and the eight pinnaces intended to perform about a third of the work could not moor close to the ship at night because the water was too choppy. Most of the scientists and engineers soon moved to tented accommodation ashore. The ship was decommissioned for the final time in December 1952 following her return to the United Kingdom, and sold and scrapped in Blyth in 1955.

It competes in the West End Grade Cricket Competition, which is administered by the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). The Western Eagles field four senior men‚Äôs, two women‚Äôs and eight junior teams and are based at Henley & Grange Memorial Oval. Other grounds used by the club include Henley High School, John Mitchell Reserve and Lockleys North PS. The club has won 14 1st grade men's premierships with the last being in 2016/17, breaking a 10-year premiership drought. In an amazing season when the Eagles fought off a merger ultimatum from the SACA, the Eagles became the first ever club to record a clean sweep of the 2-day, one-day and T20 competition titles. The Eagles have now won 5 West End Cup (One Day) Premierships (1971/72, 1972/73, 1993/94 and 2003/04, 2016/17) and the single T20 Premiership (2016/17). During the past decade the club has become one of the strongest in the South Australian Grade Cricket League, winning lower grade premierships in 1995/96, 2002/03, 2007/08 & 2012/13 (B Grade), 2003/04, 2004/05 & 2006/07 (C Grade) and winning the SACA Club Championship in 2004/05, 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2011/12. In season 2017/18, the West Torrens Women's 1st Grade emulated their male counterparts by also winning every title available, becoming T20 and One-day Premiers. History The Club began in 1857 as the Hindmarsh Cricket Club with its headquarters at Lindsay Circus (now Hindmarsh Stadium) and has continued, with only a change of name in 1897, until the present day, making it the oldest continuous and 2nd oldest existing cricket club in South Australia. Morphett Vale Cricket Club (established 1849) is the oldest cricket club in South Australia. The club moved to Thebarton Oval in 1921 where it remained until 1988 when it transferred to the adjacent King's Reserve. A lack of junior players and inadequate facilities saw a final move to the Henley and Grange Memorial Oval for the 1997-98 season. West Torrens started fielding female teams in the 2007/08 season with many players coming from the former Flinders University Women's Cricket Club. The Eagles won 1st Grade Women's Premierships in 2008/09, 2012/13 and 2017/18 and were T20 Champions in 2013/14 and 2017/18. They have also won the 2nd Grade Premiership in 2013/14 and 2015/16 and doubled up, also winning the T20 Premierships in the same years.

He was appointed Archbishop of Bordeaux around 859, but Viking raids forced him to abandon his seat in 870. With papal approval, he was transferred to the archdiocese of Bourges in 876. He died after 893. Frothar was related to the Counts of Toulouse and Rouergue, and perhaps to his predecessor at Bourges, Rodulf. By maintaining control of the abbeys of Brioude and Beaulieu, he preserved his family's influence in southern Gaul during the ascendancy of the Marquis Bernard Plantapilosa. Brioude had been under the protection of the Counts of Auvergne until 874, when Frothar possessed it. King Charles the Bald granted it permission to elect its own abbot and the monks chose Frothar, who was abbot as late as 893. After Frothar's death, the abbey reverted to the control of Duke William I of Aquitaine. Frothar was also the abbot of Saint-Hilaire-de-Poitiers from 868 and of Charroux in Provence from about the same time. Frothar was archbishop at Bordeaux by late 860, when Archbishop Hincmar of Reims directed an epistolary treatise at him and Rodulf of Bourges. In the treatise, Hincmar suggested that the marriage of a certain Count Stephen to a daughter of Count Raymond of Toulouse could be annulled on the grounds that the couple had not consummated it. Rodulf and Frothar seem to have successfully negotiated the annulment and preserved peace between the two powerful Aquitanian families of Stephen and Raymond. This was especially important because Aquitaine had recently been re-constituted as a subkingdom for the king's son, Charles the Younger. Hincmar later opposed Frothar's transfer to Bourges at the synod of Ponthion (20 June‚Äì16 July 876). Frothar was active in preserving church lands. He returned lands his family stole from Beaulieu in the Limousin and forced his relatives to confirm a charter of 887 restoring those lands to Beaulieu. He also intervened with King Carloman II to have land in Fr√©jus in Provence taken from the abbey of Saint-Victor de Marseille returned to it.

They are Aristocracy, Timocracy, Oligarchy, Democracy, and Tyranny. Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for. The tyrannical man would represent Tyranny, for example. These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with Aristocracy at the top and Tyranny at the bottom. Aristocracy Aristocracy is the form of government (politeia) advocated in Plato's Republic. This regime is ruled by a philosopher king, and thus is grounded on wisdom and reason. The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses throughout much of The Republic's books, as opposed to the other four types of states/men, that are studied primarily in Book VIII. The aristocratic state that Plato idealizes is composed of three caste-like parts: the ruling class, made up of the aforementioned philosophers-kings (who are otherwise identified as having souls of gold); the auxiliaries of the ruling caste, made up of soldiers (whose souls are made up of silver), and whose job in the state is to force on the majority the order established by the philosophers; and the majority of the people (souls of either bronze or iron), who, in contrast to the first two classes, are allowed to own property and produce goods for themselves, but are also obliged to sustain with their own activities their rulers' ‚Äî who are forbidden from owning property in order to preclude that the policies they undertake be tainted by personal interests. The aristocratic man is better represented by Plato's brand of philosopher: a man whose character and ambitions have been forged into those ideal for a just ruler through a rigorous education system designed to train intellectuals that are selfless and upright, and whose souls have been made calm and aware of the absolute Good by learning the Truth based on the Platonic Ideas. Plato envisages for this philosopher a disposition and ability that makes him the ideal governor of any state precisely because his soul knows the Idea of the Good, which is the metaphysical origin of all that is good, including happiness itself. Wealth, fame, and power are just shadows of the Good and provide only hollow and fleeting satisfaction. It is only the knowledge of the Good in itself that gives man enduring and real happiness. Thus, the philosopher who is exposed to metaphysical contemplation is not tempted to abuse his power in his pursuit of material goods, and his state policies are therefore dedicated to establishing only the Good in the state, not his personal interests. In contrast to historical aristocracies, Plato's resembles a meritocracy or proto-technocracy of sorts. In it, a big government state keeps track of the innate character and natural skills of the citizens' children, directing them to the education that best suits those traits. In this manner, a child with a gold soul born to parents with silver, bronze or iron souls will not be held back by his inferior birth and will be educated to levels above his kin according to his golden qualities. Conversely, from parents with gold and silver souls, a child born with a bronze or an iron soul is educated to only the level earned by his natural aptitudes. Timocracy Timocracy is treated in Book VIII of the Republic 545a-550c. Aristocracy degenerates into timocracy when, due to miscalculation on the part of its governing class, the next generation of guardians and auxiliaries includes persons of an inferior nature (the persons with souls made of iron or bronze, as opposed to the ideal guardians and auxiliaries, who have souls made of gold and silver). Since in the government there will be present people of an inferior nature, inclined not just to cultivating virtues but also producing wealth, a change in the constitution of the aristocratic city is eventually worked, and its educational system, which used to introduce the high classes into a purely rational, selfless political theory, is altered so that it becomes permissible for current state leaders to pursue their individual interests. The timocracy, however, does not completely break from all the characteristics of aristocracy, and for Plato this regime is a combination of good and bad features. A timocracy, in choosing its leaders, is \\"inclining rather to the more high-spirited and simple-minded type, who are better suited for war\\".Plato, Republic 8.547e The governors of timocracy value power, which they seek to attain primarily by means of military conquest and the acquisition of honors, rather than intellectual means. Plato characterizes timocracy as a mixture of the elements of two different regime types ‚Äî aristocracy and oligarchy. Just like the leaders of Platonic aristocracies, timocratic governors will apply great effort in gymnastics and the arts of war, as well as the virtue that pertains to them, that of courage. They will also be contemptuous towards manual activities and trade and will lead a life in public communion. Just like oligarchs, however, they will yearn for material wealth and will not trust thinkers to be placed in positions of power. Timocrats will have a tendency to accumulate wealth in pernicious ways, and hide their possessions from public view. They will also be spendthrift and hedonistic. Because their voluptuous nature will not be, like that of philosopher-kings, pacified in a philosophical education, law can only be imposed onto them by means of force. For Plato, timocracies were clearly superior to most regimes that prevailed in Greece in his time, which were mostly oligarchies or democracies. Crete and Sparta are two examples of timocracies given in Plato's Republic. In the Symposium, Sparta's founder, Lycurgus, is given high praise for his wisdom. And both Crete and Sparta continued to be held in admiration by Plato in one of his latest works, the Laws, for having constitutions which, unlike that of most other Greek cities, go beyond mere enumeration of laws, and focus instead on the cultivation of virtues (or at least one of them, that of courage). Plato, however, does present a criticism against those cities ‚Äî that their constitutions neglected two other virtues essential to a perfectly just city such as his aristocracy, namely wisdom and moderation. Of the man who represents a timocratic state, Socrates says that his nature is primarily good: He may see in his father (who himself would correspond to an aristocratic state) a man who doesn't bother his soul with power displays and civil disputes, but instead busies himself only with cultivating his own virtues. However, that same young man may find in other persons in his house a resentment of the father's indifference to status. Thus, by observing his father and listening to his reasoning, he's tempted to the flourishing of his own intellect and virtues; but influenced by others in his house or city, he may become power craving. He thus assents to the portion of his soul that is intermediate between reason and desire (see Plato's tripartite theory of soul), the one that is aggressive and courageous (thus the timocracy's military character). The young timocrat may himself be somewhat contemptuous towards money and money-making activity, but he becomes increasingly focused in saving his goods as he ages, since the virtues of his soul have not been purified by the salutary effects of reasoning activities and aesthetic experiences that Plato recommends to the high class. The timocrat is further described as obedient towards authority, respectful to other free citizens, good at listening, and aggressive rather than contemptuous towards slaves. Oligarchy Plato defines oligarchy as a system of government which distinguishes between the rich and the poor, making out of the former its administrators. An oligarchy is originated by extending tendencies already evident in a timocracy. In contrast to Platonic aristocrats, timocrats are allowed by their constitution to own property and thus to both accumulate and waste money. Because of the pleasures derived therefrom, money eventually is prized over virtue, and the leaders of the state seek to alter the law to give way and accommodate to the materialistic lust of its citizens. As a result of this new found appreciation for money, the governors rework the constitution yet again to restrict political power to the rich only. That is how a timocracy becomes an oligarchy. Plato gives a detailed account of the problems usually faced by the oligarchies of his days, which he considered as significantly more troubled than the former system, that of timocracy. The following are examples of such problems: * The very distribution of political power, which prevents wise and virtuous, but poor, men from influencing public life, while giving such possibility to the rich but incompetent ones; * The instability caused by class divisions: By its very nature, an oligarchy is invariably divided between the rich and the poor. Plato saw it as the state's responsibility to preclude income disparities from widening, by implementing laws that forbid citizens from enriching through exploitative contracts, or from becoming poor by wasting their money and goods. But these laws are never imposed in oligarchies since it is in the nature of the oligarchic state to seek to make inequality starker in order to feed the material lust of its governors. The poor underclass grows and many of them become either beggars or thugs imbued with anger at their condition and a revolutionary spirit which threatens the stability of the state from within. * Poor performance in military campaigns: An oligarchy will usually do poorly in military campaigns because the rich, who are few, will make a small army, and they are afraid to give weapons to the majority (the poor) due to fears of a revolution. If, by the way, a revolution does ensue, and the poor become victorious over the rich, the former expel the latter from the city, or kill them, and proceed to divide their properties and political power between one another. That is how, according to Plato, a democracy is established. As to the man whose character reflects that of an oligarchy, Plato explains his psychology with a similar scheme to the one used for the timocratic man. Just like Plato explains the timocratic character as the result of social corruption of a parent aristocratic principle, the oligarch is explained as deriving from a timocratic familial background. Thus, at first, the oligarchic son emulates his timocratic father, being ambitious and craving honor and fame. When, however, he witnesses the problems his father faces due to those timocratic tendencies ‚Äî say, he wastes public goods in a military campaign, and then is brought before the court, losing his properties after trial ‚Äî the future oligarch becomes poor. He then turns against the ambitions he had in his soul, which he now sees as harmful, and puts in their place craving for money, instead of honor, and a parsimonious cautiousness. Such men, the oligarchs, live only to enrich themselves, and through their private means they seek to fulfill only their most urgent needs. However, when in charge of public goods, they become quite 'generous'. Oligarchs do, however, value at least one virtue, that of temperance and moderation ‚Äì not out of an ethical principle or spiritual concern, but because by dominating wasteful tendencies they succeed in accumulating money. Thus even though he has bad desires ‚Äì which Plato compares to the anarchic tendencies of the poor people in oligarchies ‚Äì by virtue of temperance the oligarch manages to establish a fragile order in his soul. Thus the oligarch may seem, at least in appearance, superior to the majority of men. Democracy Oligarchy then degenerates into a democracy where freedom is the supreme good but freedom is also slavery. In democracy, the lower class grows bigger and bigger. The poor become the winners. People are free to do what they want and live how they want. People can even break the law if they so choose. This appears to be very similar to anarchy. Plato uses the \\"democratic man\\" to represent democracy. The democratic man is the son of the oligarchic man. Unlike his father, the democratic man is consumed with unnecessary desires. Plato describes necessary desires as desires that we have out of instinct or desires that we have to survive. Unnecessary desires are desires we can teach ourselves to resist such as the desire for riches. The democratic man takes great interest in all the things he can buy with his money. Plato believes that the democratic man is more concerned with his money over how he can help the people. He does whatever he wants whenever he wants to do it. His life has no order or priority. Tyranny Democracy then degenerates into tyranny where no one has discipline and society exists in chaos. Democracy is taken over by the longing for freedom. Power must be seized to maintain order. A champion will come along and experience power, which will cause him to become a tyrant. The people will start to hate him and eventually try to remove him but will realize they are not able. The tyrannical man is the son of the democratic man. He is the worst form of man due to his being the most unjust and thus the furthest removed from any joy of the true kind. He is consumed by lawless desires which cause him to do many terrible things such as murdering and plundering. He comes closest to complete lawlessness. The idea of moderation does not exist to him. He is consumed by the basest pleasures in life, and being granted these pleasures at a whim destroys the type of pleasure only attainable through knowing pain. If he spends all of his money and becomes poor, the tyrant will steal and conquer to satiate his desires, but will eventually overreach and force unto himself a fear of those around him, effectively limiting his own freedom. The tyrant always runs the risk of being killed in revenge for all the unjust things he has done. He becomes afraid to leave his own home and becomes trapped inside. Therefore, his lawlessness leads to his own self-imprisonment. Plato further expounds upon the unjustness that leads to misery in a tyranny, through the voice of Socrates, when he illustrates sought after values of three sorts. Wisdom and reason are of the highest and most just caliber of purity for they allow a man to experience and understand the fruits of the other values while being goods in themselves. Below wisdom and reason is the pursuit of honor, and below that are the basest desires of man, those satiated by sustenance and courtesans. These base desires grant the least joy because of their attachment to pain, that is, they are only joyful when not taken for granted. And in the case of the tyrant, who has the power to seize what he wants, those desires would always be satisfied and thus never truly satisfying.

The show is held annually at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison, Wisconsin, United States. Considered the largest and most important dairy cattle show in North America, it has been held in the first week of October since 1967, except 2020 when it was cancelled as the COVID-19 pandemic was the cause. Themes One of the unusual aspects about the World Dairy Expo is its themes. Since the late 1980s the show has had a theme, when the showing is decorated with two backdrops that correspond to that year's theme. Themes have ranged from the simple to the extravagant, like the \\"Excitement is Building\\" theme which had a huge construction-like backdrop. Cattle show Dairy cattle from all over North America, Europe & Australia are exhibited at the show. All seven nationally recognized breeds (Brown Swiss, Holstein, Red & White, Guernsey, Jersey, Milking Shorthorn, and Ayrshire) have a show. After a grand champion from each breed is selected, a final judging is held to determine the best two cows in the show. This is held on the last day (Saturday) and is often referred to as the main event. The show starts out with an introduction of each cow and leadsman (person at the end of the halter) listing both of their achievements. After this is done the cows are judged by all of the breed judges from the past week. After they decide on a cow, the Supreme Champion and Reserve Supreme Champion is announced. Trade show World Dairy Expo is also home to the a largest dairy-focused trade show in the world. Nearly 900 companies from all over the world exhibit to the show's 70,000 attendees. Companies like John Deere, Case IH, Land O'Lakes, Select Sires, Semex, ABS, ANIMART and many more make the trip to Madison, Wisconsin, USA every year. World Dairy Expo is recognized as a member of the \\"Tradeshow Week Top 200\\", a list honoring the nation's top trade events organized by Trade Show Executive Gold 100. World Dairy Expo remains the only Wisconsin event in the ‚ÄúTop 200‚Äù, and was ranked #23 in 2013. Youth contests World Dairy Expo offers conferences for the youth in the dairy industry. There are several regional and national judging contests in which teams and individuals from high school FFA chapters and 4-H programs can compete in as well as a division for Collegiate level teams. Contestants compete for honors in dairy judging, dairy foods and dairy forage. There is a separate junior cattle show for contestants who are college age or younger. This cattle show is separate from the main show and Supreme and Reserve Supreme champions are named the same way as the older contestants. Winning the junior show is almost as prestigious as winning the open show.

Rilke, the son of an Austrian army officer, had studied at the academy's lower school at Sankt P√∂lten in the 1890s. Kappus corresponded with the popular poet and author from 1902 to 1908 seeking his advice as to the quality of his poetry, and in deciding between a literary career or a career as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Kappus compiled and published the letters in 1929‚Äîthree years after Rilke's death from leukemia. In the first letter, Rilke respectfully declines to review or criticize Kappus' poetry, advising the younger Kappus that \\"Nobody can advise you and help you, nobody. There is only one way. Go into yourself.\\"Rainer Maria Rilke to Franz Xaver Kappus (Paris, 17 February 1903), compiled as the first letter in Rilke, Rainer Maria. Letters to a Young Poet (1929). Rilke, over the course of the ten letters, proceeds to advise Kappus on how a poet should feel, love, and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art. These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his working process. Further, these letters were written during a key period of Rilke's early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of Das Stunden-Buch (The Book of Hours) and Das Buch der Bilder (The Book of Images).Freedman, Ralph. \\"Das Stunden-Buch and Das Buch der Bilder: Harbingers of Rilke's Maturity\\" in Metzger, Erika A. and Metzger, Michael M. (editors). A Companion to the Works of Rainer Maria Rilke. (Rochester, New York: Camden House Publishing, 2001), 90‚Äì92. Writing and publication The author of the letters: Rainer Maria Rilke =Correspondence with Rilke= In 1929, Franz Xaver Kappus compiled ten letters that he received from Rainer Maria Rilke that were written from 1902 to 1908 and published them under the title Briefe an einen jungen Dichter (Letters to a Young Poet) through Insel Verlag in Leipzig. Rilke and Kappus never met in person.van den Leun, Justine. \\"Meeting the Goose\\", in The Paris Review Daily (blog belonging to the quarterly literary publication The Paris Review) (14 June 2010). Retrieved 12 June 2013. In an introduction to the collection, Kappus recounts how he came to write to Rainer Maria Rilke. According to Kappus, in late 1902 while a student at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in Lower Austria, he was reading Rilke's poetry.Kappus, Franz Xaver. \\"Introduction\\" in Letters to a Young Poet (Leipzig: Insel Verlag, 1929). He was approached by the academy's chaplain, Horacek, who noted that Rilke had been a pupil years earlier at the academy's lower school at Sankt P√∂lten. Horacek expressed surprise that the former pupil had \\"become a poet\\" and described to Kappus the young Rilke as a \\"thin, pale boy\\" whose quiet demeanor proved unable to bear the strain of a military education and life.Rilke, Rainer Maria and Kappus, Franz Xaver. Letters to a Young Poet in an edition by M. D. Herter Norton (translator). (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1993). Rilke did not continue his military education. At the time that Kappus learned this he was inclined toward writing and was not very keen on the notion of dedicating his life to the military. Kappus then decided to write to Rilke for advice. When Kappus wrote his first letter to Rilke he asked for Rilke to provide a critique of his poetry. Rilke provided the young Kappus very little in criticism or in suggestions for his improvement as a poet. Instead, Rilke discouraged Kappus from reading criticism and advised him to trust his inner judgment, commenting that \\"Nobody can advise you and help you. Nobody. There is only one way‚ÄîGo into yourself.\\" Rilke provided advice that inspired Kappus to search broader issues of intimacy and the nature of beauty and art, as well as probing philosophical and existential questions. The letters address personal issues that Kappus had apparently revealed to Rilke; ranging from atheism, loneliness, and career choices. The collection does not include Kappus' letters to Rilke, though the original German collection does include one sonnet of Kappus' own that Rilke sent back to him in Rilke's handwriting with the instruction to \\"Read the lines as if they were unknown to you, and you will feel in your inmost self how very much they are yours.\\" =Rilke's influence on Kappus= Aside from his role in writing to Rilke and later publishing these letters, Franz Xaver Kappus (1883‚Äì1966) is largely forgotten by history. Kappus was descended from a Banat Swabian (ethnic German) family born in Timi»ôoara, in the Banat region, now divided between Hungary, Serbia and Romania. Despite the hesitancy he expressed in his letters to Rilke about pursuing a military career, he continued his military studies and served for 15 years as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. During the course of his life, he worked as a newspaper editor and journalist, writing poems, humorous sketches, short-stories, novels, and adapted several works (including his own) into screenplays for films in the 1930s. However, Kappus did not achieve lasting fame.Tullius, Nick and Leeb, Alex (editors). Banat Journalist, Writer & Author: Franz Xaver Kappus. Donauschwaben Villages Helping Hands. Retrieved 27 May 2013. The Letters =The first letter= Written in Paris, France on 17 February 1903 - Theme of letter: Criticism fails to \\"touch a work of art.\\" Rilke urges his reader to eschew others' opinions of his poetry. Instead, the young poet should look inward and examine what truly motivates him to continue writing. Rilke expands on the theme of developing a rich inner life and offers an inspiring perspective on the process of creating art.

Cramer was also a well-known London composer, teacher and pianist. The firm's premises included large showrooms for pianos and other musical instruments (for sale or hire) and sheet music on several floors and became a prominent landmark on Bond Street. Chappell was active in forming the Philharmonic Society.Boosey, p. 76 The firm's reputation grew fast, and in 1819, Ludwig van Beethoven wrote to a colleague regarding a piece that he wished to publish, \\"Potter says that Chappell in Bond Street is now one of the best publishers.\\"Boosey, p. 77 Chappell died in 1834, and his oldest son William Chappell (1809‚Äì1888) took over, managing the firm on behalf of his widowed mother, Emily Chappell n√©e Patey.Henry Davey, ‚ÄòChappell, William (1809‚Äì1888)‚Äô, rev.

Around 1843, William left to join Cramer & Co. and later to found the Percy Society and the Musical Antiquarian Society. His younger brother Thomas Patey Chappell (1819‚Äì1902) then took charge. Originally concentrating on music publishing and concert promotion, the firm started manufacturing pianos in the 1840s. Thomas extended the publishing business of Chappell & Co. and focused the publishing company on musical theatre, a specialty that is still important to the success of Chappell today. The firm promoted concerts, operas and other events that might create a market for music sales. Thomas conceived of and sponsored the Monday and Saturday Popular Concerts at St James Hall (1859), which was partly owned by the family. The concerts were successfully managed by a younger brother, Samuel Arthur Chappell, until they came to an end in 1901. One of Tom Chappell's successes was the publication of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and other music of Arthur Sullivan, as well as, earlier, Gounod's Faust, Balfe's The Bohemian Girl. He was also one of the original directors of the Royal College of Music and one of the original governors of the Royal Albert Hall.Boosey, p. 79 Thomas died in 1902.\\"William Chappell\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th edition Thomas was of the founding members of the Music Publishers Association and became the Association's first Chairman and held the office between 1881 and 1900.\\"The MPA Celebrates its 125th Birthday! 1881 - 2006\\" , Music Publishers Association, 4 April 2006 William Boosey wrote: During the 20th century, Chappell became one of the leading music publishers and piano manufacturers in Britain.

At Senckenberg he learned histological staining techniques from Carl Weigert (1845-1904). From 1896 to 1904 he worked in Emanuel Mendel's (1839-1907) psychiatric laboratory in Berlin. In 1904 he joined Oskar Vogt (1870-1959) at the neurobiological laboratory at the University of Berlin, where he remained until 1933. Later in his career he worked at the psychiatric clinic at the University of Utrecht, and at the Cajal Institute in Madrid. He emigrated to the UK, where he died on 15 August 1940 in the Greater London area at 71 years of age. His oldest son, Franz David Bielschowsky, also emigrated to Sheffield, UK and subsequently to Dunedin, New Zealand where he pursued an eminent career in cancer research. Bielschowsky made important contributions in his research of tuberous sclerosis, amaurotic idiocy, paralysis agitans, Huntington‚Äôs chorea and myotonia congenita. He is remembered for his histopathological work with disseminated sclerosis, the use of an histological silver stain for impregnation of nerve fibers, and with Stanley Cobb, the development of intravital silver staining.

It mainly deals with issues arising under the Resource Management Act, meaning that it covers a wide range of potential future effects of planning applications, which can include such areas as traffic congestion, noise/pollution emissions and social and commercial consequences, rather than just the 'ecological' aspects that could be implied by the 'environmental' term. History The history of independent appeal courts addressing environmental matters began with the establishment of Appeal Boards under the Town and Country Planning Act 1953. The first planning appeals were heard in February 1955. The Appeal Boards were replaced by the Planning Tribunal following the passing of the Town and Country Planning Act 1977.Politics and Planning: The Independence of the Environment Court ‚Äì Judge John Bollard, New Zealand Planning Institute 2007 Conference, Wednesday 28 March 2007 The Environment Court replaced the Planning Tribunal as a result of the Resource Management Amendment Act 1996.Environment Court (from the Ministry of Justice website) Jurisdiction The Environment Court has a substantially larger role than the Planning Tribunal, with expanded functions and powers over planning, resource consents and enforcement. Virtually all important processes and decisions under the Resource Management Act 1991, such as regional policy statements, regional and district plans, resource consents and Water Conservation Orders, may be appealed to the Environment Court. In particular, the Environment Court hears appeals on decisions on applications for resource consent on a 'de novo' basis. The Environment Court does not review the decision: it hears any evidence it requires and makes its own decision, which replaces that of the local authority. It focuses on \\"the merits and substance of the particular decision at issue, not the deliberative process of the executive authority that made the initial decision.\\"Birdsong, B. (1998), page 22. The Environment Court also has the power to make declarations that interpret the law under the Resource Management Act. The Environment Court has the status and powers of a District Court, so it can conduct prosecutions and enforcement of the Resource Management Act through civil or criminal proceedings.Birdsong, B.

It was officially adopted by the Departmental Assembly out of the winning design presented by native painter √Ålvaro Corvacho. Design The elegant shape of the escutcheon or shield is a combination of two distinct designs, the top, with its three tips is from a Swiss design, the bottom with the tip issuing out from the middle is from a French design. The shield is embraced by an olive branch (with 45 leaves) on either side, a symbol of peace. It has a tincture of azure, but in variant versions the field changes of tincture on both chief and base; in the modern version, the azure or blue represent Magdalena River and the Caribbean Sea. The shield is divided in two by a horizontal band which bears the flag of the Department of Magdalena in the background and in front of it the National Pantheon which is a structure located in Magdalena in the Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino that honours the Libertador and the fallen heroes of the nation, the superimposition of the structure on the flag symbolizes the integrity and firmness in the souls of the Magdalenenses as well as keeping alive his dream. On chief, that is the part that is on the top, bears the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta with the radiant sun issuing from behind. The official blazon calls for a snow topped mountain as it would look naturally, i.e. proper, but this leaves the possibility of a representation of the base and hill of the mountain to be coloured green or brown as both are natural colours for mountains. The blazon also calls for a river in vert or green, which is supposed to represent the Magdalena River, this being a more natural representation of the river as it waters are far from being the typical blue shown in heraldry, this however, has been left out of the modern representations of the coat of arms, choosing instead to attribute the blue background as the river. Both of these geographical features represent their importance to the region, its extreme geography going from sea level to 5,775m above sea level, as well as the natural resources it possesses, and additionally the green of the river the hope that its inhabitants have of the department taking a national leadership position, the sun symbolizes their nobility and wisdom. The base has a Tayrona golden pendant, a typical and iconic piece of the culture of the Indigenous peoples of Magdalena. History The Department of Magdalena, created in 1824 as one of the original nine Sovereign States of the United States of Colombia, originally used the Coat of arms of Colombia as the official arms of the state with the addition of an inscribed oval around the shield with the words \\"ESTADO SOBERANO DEL MAGDALENA\\" (). In 1886 the states were dissolved and departments were created instead, with the new change of governance came changes in the coat of arms. To meet this challenge the Department of Magdalena held a meeting with institutions and individuals to address this issue, and finally after different proposals were presented, the coat of arms designed by the painter Alvaro Corpacho was finally adopted as the official insignia for the department.

The La Plata - Empalme Pereyra (Villa Elisa) line was opened on 1 January 1889. In 1889 at the inauguration of the Adolfo Alsina train station, the local landowners decided to start a partnership, subdivide part of the land into lots and found a town. The train station opened on 15 February and on 24 February they announced the establishment of Villa M√°ximo Paz, named after the then governor. However, the enterprise did not immediately succeed and it took many years to attain a stable population. Initially, the first houses were used as weekend retreats for the rich people of La Plata.

Posthumus, was originally made available for purchase online through the CD Baby website in November 2001. It became the third-biggest selling album in CDBaby's history. The success of the album prompted the wide re-release to retail in May 2005 through Wigshop and 33rd Street Records/Bayside Distribution. A key piece to the distinctive sound of the music comes from working with the Northwest Sinfonia.

They have been used in the trailers for movies due to their escalating structure, which makes them well-suited for the dramatic montages building towards the credits in the aforementioned trailers. An excerpt from the track \\"Nara\\" is used as the main theme for the CBS television show Cold Case. A vocal rise performed by a female solo singer (Elise Morris) leads into the opening title, where one of the verses of \\"Nara\\" is then played for the remainder of the sequence, concluding with a short melody from a woodwind instrument. At the time Executive Producer Jerry Bruckheimer chose the song to be used in the show, he had never actually met the Vonlichten brothers in person. Additionally, Michael A. Levine, a musical composer for television shows and advertisements, created a reworked version of \\"Nara\\" that is played during the show's closing credits as provided by the studio (though not as shown on CBS). The track was also featured in the animation for the presentation of the design for the Beijing WaterCube by the firm architectural LAVA. The track \\"Ebla\\" was also used as the main menu music for the 2008 racing video game Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli.

The Canon seeks to impose a trust, in favor of the Episcopal Church, on property held by a local group of Episcopal adherents (whether a parish, mission, or congregation). The Canon's intended effect is to discourage a local group from withdrawing from the Episcopal Church, as under the Dennis Canon such property would revert to the Episcopal Church. In light of the larger doctrinal controversies surrounding the Episcopal Church, and the decision of some local congregations (and dioceses) to withdraw from the Episcopal Church, the Canon has surfaced in litigation between church or diocese factions regarding ownership of property. Canon text The Canon states: History and purpose The Dennis Canon is named after Walter Dennis, an attorney and later Suffragan Bishop of New York, who drafted the Canon. It was passed by the 66th General Convention in 1979, having been introduced by the Committee on Canons of the House of Bishops as D-024 of that Convention. During the turbulent 1960s and 1970s, some parishes left the Episcopal Church and attempted to retain the parish property for reasons including the admission of women to Holy Orders, the adoption of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer, and the belief that some bishops held heretical views.Legal Affairs In 1979, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Jones v. Wolf that the \\"neutral principles of law\\" approach to deciding property disputes between factions of a church offered advantages versus other means (which may have required involvement in matters of purely religious affairs, an exercise which was prohibited by the First Amendment): The Supreme Court went on to state (in response to the dissent): As such, the Dennis Canon was written in response to the Supreme Court's ruling, by modifying TEC's Canons in an attempt to create an express trust in favor of TEC should a faction of a local parish seek to withdraw from TEC. The Episcopal Church maintains that, legally, any officer of any official institution must maintain his or her fiduciary trust responsibility on behalf of the Episcopal Church. Litigation involving the Dennis Canon In recent years, some Episcopalians have challenged the Episcopal Church over its doctrine, discipline, and worship. Because of these disputes, parishes and five entire dioceses have made attempts to sever ties with the rest of the Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Church maintains that these groups cannot dissociate, only individuals can. Therefore, Episcopal Church leaders assert that they have attempted to take property and assets with them. Those groups that have left maintain that most of these properties and assets were established long before the Dennis Canon by loyal Episcopalians that would not recognize the theological innovations of the modern Episcopal Church. To date, there have been a number of court cases either challenging or seeking to enforce the Dennis Cannon and few of them are entirely resolved.The Episcopal Diocese of Ohio, et al. v. The Anglican Church of the Transfiguration, et al. Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, OH Case No. CV-08-654973 =Virginia= In the Commonwealth of Virginia, where a Civil War era \\"division statute\\", concerning denominations that split in two, has ruled in favor of the Episcopal Church (though the question of the Episcopal Church's trust interest was not ultimately addressed).The Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Virginia, et al. v. Truro Church, et al. Fairfax County, VA Circuit Court Case No. CL-2007-0248724 The congregations seeking to leave (which include, among others, The Falls Church, the historic congregation for which the city of Falls Church, Virginia is named, and where George Mason and George Washington were once members) had their initial court victory overruled when using the \\"division statute\\" by the Virginia Supreme Court in 2010, which held that the statute did not apply because instead of simply leaving the Episcopal denomination to form their own organization, the churches instead joined another organization affiliated with the Church of Nigeria, which had never been part of the Protestant Episcopal Church even though both were descended from the Church of England.http://www.courts.state.va.us/opinions/opnscvwp/1090682.pdf In January, 2012, the Fairfax Circuit Court issued an order implementing the Supreme Court's decision.http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/courts/cases/in_re_multi- circuit_episcopal_church_litigation/episcopal.htm Some of the churches in the suit have reached settlements with the Diocese, but others have appealed.http://www.standfirminfaith.com/?/sf/page/28605 =South Carolina= Another case is All Saints Parish in Waccamaw, South Carolina. In this case, the Parish of All Saints won ownership of all property and assets after a lengthy court battle that was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. Following \\"neutral principles of law,\\" the state Supreme Court held that, since the parish existed before the formation of either the diocese or the Episcopal Church, and in light of an earlier quitclaim deed, the Dennis Canon did not apply. The local State court held that: \\"It is an axiomatic principle of law that a person or entity must hold title to property in order to declare that it is held in trust for the benefit of another or transfer legal title to one person for the benefit of another.\\"All Saints Parish Waccamaw v. The Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of South Carolina http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/26724.htm Subsequent to that case, the Diocese of South Carolina voted in 2012 to dissociate from the Episcopal Church. This case is still in early stages, and has yet to have a full trial in state courts. It remains to be seen whether this case will have significant bearing, but at the center of this issue is the legality of the Dennis Canon.http://www.diosc.com =Georgia and Connecticut= Two churches (from Georgia and Connecticut), where the state Supreme Courts ruled in favor of the Episcopal Church and the Canon, asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeals.\\"Three Parishes Who Lost Their Properties Request Supreme Court Review\\" http://www.standfirminfaith.com/?/sf/page/28575The article mentions three churches; however, the third is a Presbyterian congregation involved in a similar lawsuit. The U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in the Connecticut casehttp://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/gauss-v-the-protestant- episcopal-church-in-the-united-states-of-america/ while the Georgia case was dismissed by the Supreme Court pursuant to its Rule 46.https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12511280172584419792&hl;=en&as;_sdt=2006 =Texas= Two cases from Texas involving breakaway groups, and ultimately ownership to church property, were decided in August 2013; in both cases the Texas Supreme Court remanded the cases to the trial court. In its orders, the Court ruled that the \\"neutral principles\\" methodology would apply in these and all future cases involving religious groups:Previously Texas allowed courts to decide church property issues under either the \\"hierarchical deference\\" methodology (whereby a faction loyal to the denomination would be considered the rightful owner of church property) or \\"neutral principles\\". The ruling essentially eliminated \\"hierarchical deference\\" as a review option. *The first case involves the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (ACNA) (ACNA Diocese), which (along with the majority of the parishes) broke away from the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (Episcopal Church). The ACNA Diocese amended its corporate charter in 2006 to remove all references to the Episcopal Church, and during 2007 and 2008 formally withdrew from the Episcopal Church, joined with the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone, and amended its constitution to remove all references to the Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Church countered by holding a February 2009 meeting of members remaining loyal to the Episcopal Church, revoking the actions taken during 2007 and 2008 and declaring the loyal members (and those parishes not breaking away) to constitute the \\"true\\" Episcopal Diocese, and filing suit against the ACNA Diocese seeking title to property. The trial court ruled for the Episcopal Church; the ACNA Diocese took a direct appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 to remand the case to the trial court.For the dissenting opinion see http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2013/aug/110265d.pdf *The second case involves a single parish within the Episcopal Diocese of Northwest Texas. The Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd, a parish located in San Angelo, held a business meeting on November 12, 2006 and voted to 1) amend its corporate charter and bylaws to remove references to the Episcopal Church and the Diocese, 2) withdraw from the Episcopal Church and the Diocese, and 3) rename itself as \\"Anglican Church of the Good Shepherd\\" and amend its corporate charter to the new name. The changes were to be effective on January 5, 2007; however, prior to that date the Diocese bishop ruled that the parish could not unilaterally withdraw from the Diocese, held a meeting with members remaining loyal to the Diocese and elected a new priest, and filed suit seeking title to the property. The trial court ruled in favor of the Diocese and the court of appeals affirmed. The Texas Supreme Court ruled 7-2 to remand to the trial court.A separate concurring opinion was issued, see http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2013/aug/110332c.pdf For the dissenting opinion see http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2013/aug/110332d.pdf The Texas cases and the \\"neutral principles of law\\" approach that the Texas Supreme Court ordered the trial court to use appears to favor the break-away groups and calls into question the enforceability or legal solidity of the Canon.http://www.standfirminfaith.com/?/sf/page/30781 References Category:Canon law of the Anglican Communion Category:Episcopal Church (United States) ","title":"Dennis Canon"},{"id":"9909264","text":"Dusi is a village and panchayat in Amadalavalasa mandal in Srikakulam district in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

Morgan, Oxford University Press, 1981 Plot The story is set in the Rhondda Valley in the early 1930s. It chronicles the trials and tribulations of the peoples, set against the backdrop of the aftermath of the General Strike and the Great Depression in the South Wales Valleys. It is principally seen through the eyes of a newly ordained chapel minister, the Reverend Dan Price. The story is peopled with colourful characters who mostly struggle to live their lives during economic troubles. They include Dan's uncle, John 'Shoni' Lloyd, an ex- First World War soldier and confirmed non-chapel goer, Morgan 'Big Mog' Morgan, an ex-miner, ex-soldier and now a successful bookie and philanthropist, David 'Dai Hippo' Daniels, an ex-miner and firebrand Communist activist, and Guy Sprattling, ('the captain') a badly shell-shocked veteran of the war who works for Big Mog until he is eventually able to face the world again. Dan throws himself into his work at Beulah chapel, which is heavily in debt, and attempts to draw more people into the work of the chapel and improve attendance (and thereby its income). He persuades the fiery 'Llew Rhondda', the chapel's choirmaster known as 'God's Songmaster', to revive the tradition of choral performances at Beulah. On his visit to Evans the Draper, he meets Lucy Meredith and is smitten with her, eventually courting her, whilst carrying on his full-time work at the chapel, giving lectures, producing amateur dramatics and trying to persuade people to come to chapel instead of attending boxing matches and communist rallies. When he dies, Evans the Draper wills his estate and house to Lucy, so that she and Dan can marry.

It was written in French in 1961 as Pochade radiophonique and published in Minuit 16, November 1975. Beckett translated the work into English shortly before its broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 13 April 1976. Martin Esslin directed Harold Pinter (Animator), Billie Whitelaw (Stenographer) and Patrick Magee (Fox). The English-language version was first published in Ends and Odds (Grove, 1976, Faber, 1977) as Radio II.

The interchange is light and familiar. He then consults a character called Dick;Dick was Alfred P√©ron's nickname (as in Moby Dick) during his time in the French resistance cell that he was a part of along with Beckett. When the cell was betrayed, P√©ron was arrested by the Gestapo and ended up in Mauthausen where he survived the war. Beckett, of course, had to go into hiding. is he on his toes? The man, a mute, doesn‚Äôt answer other than to make a swishing noise to which the Animator exclaims, ‚ÄúWow!There are four types of fox calls. The call most often heard is the 'wow-wow-wow'. (See IPCC Information Sheet: On the Fox's Trail) Let‚Äôs hear it land.‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 115 Dick strikes the desk with, what the text refers to as, a ‚Äúbull‚Äôs pizzle‚Äù,Although used the world over, the use of the pizzle is common in Europe and particularly Germany.

(‚ÄòDick‚Äô is, of course, a euphemism for penis). It is certainly humorous, though hardly revolutionary, to use a character that is unable to speak in a radio play. What is of interest is that it is his job to encourage Fox to speak. Dick is instructed to remove a hood from a fourth figure, Fox, followed by his gag, blindfold and earplugs. The man is kept bound though. As his eyes adjust to the light he recognises ‚Äúthe same old team‚Äù ‚Äì evidently this is not then the first time he has been interrogated. Unexpectedly he smilesSly as a fox's smile - crafty, cunning. at the woman and this startles her, which prompts a coarse remark from the Animator: ‚ÄúWhat is it, miss? Vermin in the lingerie?‚Äù This is not the first time he has smiled; she checks to see if it should be recorded but is told not to. The Stenographer proceeds to read her report on the results from day before but the Animator has her skip practically all of it apart from the first three ‚Äúexhortations‚Äù. Item #3 expresses particular concern regarding the condition and use of the Fox's gag. It is imperative he make no utterance that cannot be recorded and scrutinized in case what he says ‚Äúmay be it‚Äù.Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 116 ‚ÄúBut no word,A recurring notion [in Beckett's writing is] that \\"thoughts and the concomitant words that shape them are merely sounds made by a voice, ‚Äònothing beyond mere ejaculations of air‚Äô; that the idea of meaninglessness is only a mere ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô which is not provable and slowly fades into emptiness ... the more it is pondered and the more the writer or speaker attempts to capture it in words, ‚Äòin one pure word‚Äô.

This ‚Äì predictably ‚Äì prompts comment from the Auditor: ‚ÄúStaggering! Ah were I but ‚Ä¶ forty years younger‚Äù, another inappropriate remark underlining his lascivious nature. The text does not comment on what she is ‚Äì or is not ‚Äì wearing underneath but Billie Whitelaw's observation in a Radio Times interview is revealing: ‚ÄúI felt that the girl I play, the stenographer, starts out in uniform and ends with nothing on.‚ÄùInterview with Billie Whitelaw, Radio Times, 10‚Äì16 April 1976; University of Reading (MS3081) Her response is to reread the end of Fox's last testimony: ‚ÄúAh my God my God [Blow with pencil] My God,‚Äù words that remind one of someone's cries while in a state of sexual ecstasy but presented in the least erotic of tones.The simplest and most universal exclamation of ecstasy is \\"Oh, God!

She recommends ‚Äúa touch of kindness‚Äù be applied to Fox, ‚Äúperhaps just a hint.‚Äù The Animator says he appreciates the sentiment but is obdurate: they stick with his method (despite its obvious lack of results). After further prompting by Dick, Fox begins his second monologue describing a life underground (perhaps the mole's he spoke of before), ‚Äúliving dead in the stones.‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 118 He fades away but, when threatened with the whip again, moves onto his third outpouring, where he mentions a brother ‚Äì the first family member he has spoken of ‚Äì his twin, actually inside himself and hungry. Someone named ‚ÄúMaud‚ÄùPerhaps a nod to Alfred, Lord Tennyson‚Äôs poem Maud with its famous opening line: ‚ÄúCome into the garden Maud.‚Äù ‚Äì the only person he has ever mentioned by name ‚Äì has proposed a Caesarean section volunteering to nurse the twin when born. At this point Fox breaks down and starts weeping. The Animator remains undecided as to whether this should be recorded. Up until this point he has been adamant that only Fox's words are relevant. A final stroke of Dick's pizzle brings only one line. Fox ‚Äì or more likely the mole/twin ‚Äì cries out: ‚ÄúLet me out! Peter out in the stones!‚Äù In a change of tactic, the Animator quietly tries to make clear to Fox what he really wants: ‚ÄúMore variety! ‚Ä¶ [A]stonish me.‚Äù,Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), pp 121,122 He even hints to him that he might try being creative with the truth, the very notion of which shocks the Stenographer. It may seem at first look that the bound protagonist is the captive, but by this stage of the play, the audience is beginning to realise that the Stenographer and Animator are the ones who are truly captive. They hang upon every word Fox emits. The Animator even confesses that he doesn‚Äôt know precisely what he is looking for other than he‚Äôll know it when he hears it, unlike Bam in What Where who is after specific details. It is becoming clearer that the Animator is seeking something in Fox that most likely isn‚Äôt there. Since physical violence hasn‚Äôt proved successful, nor has gentle persuasion, the Animator modifies his approach once more: ‚ÄúDick! ‚Äì no, wait. Kiss him, miss, perhaps that will stir some fibre ‚Ä¶ on his stinker of a mouth ‚Ä¶ Till it bleeds! Kiss it white!‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 122 Fox howls and faints. Since nothing more is to be gotten from Fox the two review the evidence, the tear ‚Äì he had shed a number the previous winter ‚Äì and Maud's willingness to act as a wet nurse. The Stenographer highlights the point that, for Maud to be able to produce milk pointed to the fact she is likely already pregnant. The Animator drools over the image of a milk-engorged breast: ‚ÄúOne can almost see it!‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 124 The woman wonders out loud who might be the father. This finally fires Animator's imagination: ‚ÄúMay we have that passage again, miss?‚Äù She reads it verbatim but he objects insisting she is omitting the phrase, ‚Äúbetween two kisses.‚Äù She tries to stand her ground but he gets angry and demands she amend her notes accordingly effectively ‚Äúinsert[ing] the Stenographer (and her kissing of Fox) into Fox‚Äôs discourse.‚ÄùLawley, P., ‚ÄòThe Difficult Birth: An Image of Utterance in Beckett‚Äô in Davis, R.

She acquiesces and timidly reads back the text. Finally, something to appeal to his crude tastes. He is now satisfied and is hopeful that by the next day their work may very well be done. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cry, miss, dry your pretty eyes and smile at me. Tomorrow, who knows, we may be free.‚Äù This reminds us of the ending of Radio I: ‚ÄúTomorrow ‚Ä¶ noon.‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 111 Everything will be better tomorrow. Beckett brings many of his characters to this brink (e.g. Clov at the end of Endgame) but for these trapped souls the future only turns out to be an endless succession of today's. Interpretation Scholars have demonstrated a fondness for grouping Beckett's works according to perceived themes: memory plays, political plays, ghost plays and so on. Rough for Radio II can easily sustain a political interpretation (one wonders how much it influenced Pinter's own One for the Road, for example) but alternative readings can also be made of the other so- called ‚Äòpolitical‚Äô plays. These plays, Catastrophe and What Where can also be grouped along with Rough for Theatre II and Rough for Radio II as ‚Äòprocedural‚Äô plays. Whereas many of Beckett's work have a circular aspect, these four plays all have a linear core; each can be, or is, stopped when certain conditions are met. In the case of Catastrophe, when the living statue meets the director's aesthetic criteria; in What Where, when one of the interrogators extracts the required information; in Rough for Theatre II, when a decision is made as to Croker's future and in Rough for Radio II, if an unknown sign or set of words is provided by Fox. Each play has its own process, procedures that have to be followed. All evoke bureaucracy even though in What Where there is no physical paperwork per se. Robert Sandarg has put forward this short possible synopsis of the play: : ‚ÄúRough for Radio II may concern a critic torturing an author. The Animator speaks of Sterne and Dante, ‚Äòold spectres from the days of book reviewing‚Äô,Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 120 and the twin which Fox carries monstrously within himself could be his book.‚ÄùSandarg, R., ‚ÄòA Political Perspective on Catastrophe‚Äô in Davis, R. J. and Butler, L. St J., (Eds.) ‚ÄòMake Sense Who May‚Äô: Essays on Samuel Beckett‚Äôs Later Works (Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe, 1988), p 143 As regards a ‚Äòtrue‚Äô interpretation a good starting point is Martin Esslin's comment that the play is ‚Äúabout the artistic process‚Äù itselfEsslin, M., ‚ÄòBeckett and the Art of Broadcasting‚Äô in Meditations: Essays on Brecht, Beckett and the Media (London: Methuen, 1980), p 148 which Beckett by no means found easy; his output is respectable but he was not exactly prolific. ‚ÄúThere are two moments worthwhile in writing,‚Äù he summed up to a friend, ‚Äúthe one where you start and the other where you throw it in the waste-paper basket.‚ÄùSamuel Beckett to Jacoba van Velde, 12 April 1958. Quoted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 446 The play interestingly reverses the act of creation of a radio play: ‚Äúinstead of the sequence {text ‚Üí speech ‚Üí electromagnetic vibration}, we have the sequence {twitch of whip ‚Üí speech ‚Üí text} ‚Äìfirst the slap of the bull‚Äôs pizzle on flesh, then Fox‚Äôs words, then the stenographer‚Äôs transcript.‚ÄùAlbright, D., Beckett and Aesthetics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p 114 To produce this article, this author ‚Äì and by extension those authors quoted ‚Äì first tuned into a radio broadcast (or put on a recording of one), listened to the words and then converted his understanding of them into text. =Fox= > \\"Which is more painful,\\" I asked him, \\"writing or not writing?\\" > \\"They're both painful, but the pain is different.\\"‚ÄùHe spoke a little about > the different sorts of pain, the pain of being unable to write, the pain of > writing itself, and ‚Äî as bad as any ‚Äî the pain of finishing what he'd begun. > I said, ‚ÄòIf the work is so painful when one does it and so painful when it's > done, why on earth does anyone do it?‚Äô > ‚ÄúThis was one of those questions that caused him ... to disappear behind > his hand, covering his eyes and bending his head toward the table for what > must have been two full minutes.

Animator is not really listening to Fox any more than a great number of Beckett's audiences over the years haven‚Äôt listened to him: Godot sounds like God so he must be God, mustn‚Äôt he?Samuel Beckett‚Äôs standard answer, when asked by him who Godot was: ‚ÄúIf I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have written he play.‚Äù Once he went a little further and said to Sir Ralph Richardson, ‚Äúif by Godot I had meant God, I would have said God and not Godot.‚Äù ‚Äì Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E., (Eds.) The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett, (London: Faber and Faber, 2006), p 232 Fox sounds like ‚Äòvox‚Äô, the Latin word for ‚Äòvoice‚Äô, but in this case it is not unreasonable to assume this is intentional on Beckett's part considering his only requirement is to give voice to that certain something that will satisfy his interrogator. It is worth mentioning that in the French original the interrogatee is still named ‚ÄòFox‚Äô rather than ‚ÄòRenard‚Äô perhaps because Beckett wanted his audience to make the Fox/Vox connection first. The French for ‚Äòvoice‚Äô is ‚Äòvoix‚Äô.The Modern English \\"fox\\" is derived from Old English with the same spelling, the Old English word itself comes from the Proto-Germanic word \\"fukh\\"; the modern German word for fox is \\"fuchs\\". ‚ÄúFox‚Äôs stream of words presents a series of puzzling images. Should the listener simply consider each of these ‚Äì the soaping of the mole, his drying by the embers, the mention of a parasitic twin brother growing within him, a mother figure named Maud ‚Äì as pictograms, which escape interpretation? Fox only speaks under duress. Does he represent the artist figure, forced by habit or vocation to express himself in a series of ever-repeating motifs despite not having a specific purpose or subject? Whether or not he has something revelatory to communicate ‚Ä¶ he lives up to his name by not divulging it. As a result, his silence gives him power over his captors and even his torturer, Dick.‚ÄùBranigan, K., ‚ÄòGlossolalies ‚Äì Beckett And Artaud On Air‚Äô in National University of Ireland, Maynooth, Postgraduate Research Record 2004, p 20 Symbols are the method that the unconscious uses to communicate important information and guidance to the conscious mind. Fox's speech from the day before talks about returning a dead mole to his womblike chamber (with food to last it), an image centred on insertion; the first of the new day concentrates on the mole (now miraculously alive ‚Äì ‚ÄúLive I did‚Ä¶) moving through tunnels seeking the way out (in fact the text shifts to a first-person narrative) whereas the final section focuses on Fox‚Äôs awareness of his twin‚Äôs hunger driving his desperate need for extraction. ‚ÄúTaken together, Fox‚Äôs three utterances can be seen to construct a scenario of a self-birth attempted yet blocked.‚ÄùLawley, P., ‚ÄòThe Difficult Birth: An Image of Utterance in Beckett‚Äô in Davis, R. J. and Butler, L.

In Cascando (1962/63) this is what the controller is called, the ‚ÄúOpener‚Äù,Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 137 after his function. His use of the term ‚Äúpassage‚Äù to refer to something Fox has said before emphasises that what we are hearing is the ‚Äúscrabble, scrabble‚Äù of his ‚Äúold twin‚Äù trying to find a way out. This culminates in the final cry: ‚ÄúLet me out!‚ÄùBeckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 121 If Fox embodies the source of raw data available to the creative process, personified by the Animator and his team, what does Fox's twin represent? Most likely his deepest, darkest memories, memories that he has repressed\\"The difficulty is access to the voice and its veracity once trapped, but the too-obvious links between voice and repressed memory may account for SB's decision to jettison the work.\\" ‚Äì Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E., (Eds.) The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett, (London: Faber and Faber, 2006), p 615 (or at least suppressed). Aware that it may be these that the Animator is trying to reach Fox exercises his power over him by refusing to release them to him (‚Äúah but no, no no‚Äù); they look as if they may ‚Äòdie‚Äô inside him. The metaphorical image of an author giving birth to a work of fiction is not new, nor is the picture of the ‚Äútortured artist‚Äù, nor even the assertion that all fiction is thinly veiled biography; in Beckett's case there are biographical elementsHe explained that the main excitement in writing had always been technical for him, a combination of ‚Äúmetaphysics and technique. A problem is there and I have to solve it.‚Äù \\"Why metaphysics?\\" I said. \\"Because,\\" he said, \\"you've got your own experience.

The trapped foetus can survive as a parasite even past birth by forming an umbilical cord-like structure that leeches its twin's blood supply until it grows so large that it starts to harm the host, at which point doctors usually intervene. \\"Influential psychoanalysts Didier Anzieu and Bennett Simon as well as a number of Beckett critics hold that Wilfred Bion's 1950 paper on The Imaginary Twin is part of a fictionalised account of his treatment of Beckett some fifteen years earlier ‚Ä¶ The suspicion that the young Beckett is patient A of The Imaginary Twin is supported by Bion's description of his inventive analysand as a man who was adept at blurring the boundary between real and imaginary events, who made ambiguous statements that were open to multiple interpretations, who felt that he was inhabited by an unborn twin and imagined himself in a womb afraid to be born.‚ÄùBion, W.

On the other hand, Fox, as a 'fodient rodent', does seem to be trying to burrow towards some deep truth. He is remarkable interested in tunnels; not only does he soap a mole, but he also says at one point that he is taking to the tunnels, and the foetal or ghost twin that Fox conceals in his belly is also suggestive of his preoccupation with the interior of things ...

This represents the \\"slippage between what the artist wants to express and what he is capable of expressing. As Beckett says of Bram van Velde in the three dialogues, he was 'the first to admit that to be an artist is to fail.'\\"Buning, M., Oppenheim L., Beckett in the 1990s: Selected Papers from the Second International Beckett Symposium (Amsterdam Rodopi, 1993), p 16 Bearing this in mind the oft quoted lines from Worstward Ho take on a greater significance: \\"Ever tried.

And so, when one sees a name like Anima-tor, an obvious question to ask is: is this character a personification of the character's anima?Anima, originally from Latin, refers to passion, spirit, and \\"living essence.\\" It may come from the Proto-Indo-European language root ane- (\\"to breathe\\"), from which animal and animation also originate. It may also refer to one's \\"true self\\" as well as the feminine side of a man's unconscious mind in the psychology of Carl Jung. If that is the case then what we have in Rough for Radio II, like Rough for Radio I, is another of Beckett's ‚Äúmindscapes‚Äù.Brown, V., Yesterday‚Äôs Deformities: A Discussion of the Role of Memory and Discourse in the Plays of Samuel Beckett , (doctoral thesis) Jung viewed the anima process as being one of the sources of creative ability (which would make Fox the wellspring of ideas, experiences and dreams). ‚ÄúA complex consists of two parts; an archetypal core ‚Ä¶ (Animator) ‚Ä¶ surrounded by a cluster or shell of images, memories, and feelings ‚Ä¶ (Fox) ‚Ä¶ that are the result of childhood experiences with human beings. It is as if the archetypal core acts like a magnet, around which events cluster that belong to that archetype. This core adds energy to the complex.‚ÄùBasic Jung, Lecture notes of Dr. Lionel Corbett, Pacifica Graduate Institute The Animator is a sensualist who imposes his grossness on his victims, Fox, an intuitive creature who lives by his senses and also his unfortunate female assistant. There is no doubt that Beckett had a sexual side to his nature though ‚Äì understandably ‚Äì little is on record as to how this aspect of him affected his work. His writing, although not primarily sexual, never shies away from it but one could never refer to it as ‚Äòtitillating‚Äô. That sexual urges might have distracted him from his writing is always a possibility. Anthony Cronin, in his biography, talks about the year when Beckett was struggling to complete Murphy . Some days he would go for long walks ‚Äúfrom nine or ten in the morning until six or seven in the evening, scarcely seeing a soul. Telling MacGreevy about this, he said it saved masturbation.‚ÄùCronin, A., Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist (London: Flamingo, 1997), p 233 ‚ÄúThe anima ‚Ä¶ holds in it an expression of a man's complex of feelings about women, gained as experience mostly from his motherIn its individual manifestation, the character of a man's anima is as a rule shaped by his mother. If his mother had a negative influence, his anima will often express itself in irritable, depressed moods, uncertainty, passivity, insecurity and touchiness. Dark 'anima moods' can therefore infect his life, taking on a sad and oppressive aspect. ‚Äì Jung's Model of the Psyche - Part Two, BBC article ‚Äì or lack of mother ‚Äì but also from a synthesis of all his female contacts ‚Ä¶ A negative side to the anima that is ‚Äúthat of the woman/mother who poisons everything, whose ‚Ä¶ critical remarks hurt and constantly demean. This may live on in a man as self-criticism. A slight twist on this is the man who considers himself an intellectual, but actually is possessed by an anima that does not allow real creative thought, but expresses opinions and fears as clever words (‚ÄúHave you read the Purgatory, miss, of the divine Florentine?‚Äù) or arguments (‚ÄúWhat the devil are you deriding, miss? My hearing? My memory? My good faith?‚Äù). This enables the person to feel [they are] always right, and actually avoid any real meeting with other people or life experience. Strangely, such men are often driven to pornography,Beckett was once asked \\"to do an English translation of the Marquis de Sade's Les Cenr-Vinght Jours de Sodom ... Beckett had been interested in de Sade for some time ... [and] insisted there should be a preface [where] he could make his attitude and his motive as well as his admiration for de Sade quite clear. A number of commentators have suggested that there is a considerable amount of what is loosely called Sadism in Beckett's own work. ‚Äì Cronin, A., Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist (London: Flamingo, 1997), pp 291,292 in a desperate drive to meet denied personal needs.‚ÄùCrisp, A., Archetype of the Anima Beckett stipulates that the Animator has a ‚Äúcylindrical ruler‚Äù,\\"Samuel Beckett's father was a quantity surveyor, and such a ruler, 'a solid ebony cylindrical rod', Phil Baker discovered, was kept in the offices of Beckett & Medcalf ‚Äì Ackerley, C.

Dick is in no way a fully-fledged character in his own right, rather an extension of the Animator, a penis substituteThe expression has been absorbed into popular culture and its strict Freudian use sublimated. The most common examples of penis substitutes in modern society are arguably cars and guns. (admittedly a Freudian term). The Stenographer only has a small pencil showing her place in the pecking order. (Although represented by a female she is nevertheless an aspect of a male character). There is a subtext of impotence however. The Animator is trying to get something from Fox that's not there; he tries to read into it and, eventually, has to ‚Äòspice up‚Äô the text himself. ‚ÄúIn the end it comes down to a question of bending the truth to get relief.‚ÄùMcGovern, B., ‚ÄòBeckett and the Radio Voice‚Äô in Murray, C., (Ed.) Samuel Beckett ‚Äì 100 Years (Dublin: New Island, 2006), p 139 Ultimately the creative process has not been faithful to the truth but does it have to be? More than most writers, Beckett plumbed the depths of his own life for source material. Some sections are transparently biographical (e.g. the scene in Krapp‚Äôs Last Tape where Krapp's mother dies) but exactly how faithful to the truth only Beckett himself would know. But it is a work of fiction, not a psychological treatise and certainly not biography in the strictest sense; the facts are bent to fit the truth of the play.

Description The term originates from artillery, referring to a gun that fires before it has been pulled back. In artillery guns, \\"out of battery\\" usually refers to a situation where the recoiling mass (breech and barrel) has not returned to its proper position after firing because of a failure in the recoil mechanism. Most gun carriage designs should prevent this; however, if a gun is fired out of battery, then damage to the carriage can occur, as the effectiveness of the recoil mechanism will have been compromised. In firearms and artillery where there is an automatic loading mechanism, a condition can occur in which a live round is at least partially in the firing chamber and capable of being fired, but is not properly secured by the operating mechanism, known as the bolt in handheld firearms, of that particular weapon. The gas pressure produced at the moment of firing can rupture the not fully supported cartridge case and can result in flame and high-pressure gas being vented at the breech of the weapon, potentially creating flying fragments and possibly injuring the operator. Out- of-battery firings can be initiated by a deliberate action by the operator (i.e. pulling the trigger) or initiated involuntarily as part of a slamfire. In handheld firearms, damage from out-of-battery discharges often destroy the firearm's magazine and destroy or severely damage the receiver, bolt, firing pin, operating springs, and stock. Extreme damage to cartridge casings, such as blown case heads, are indicative of out of battery firings in addition to damages sustained by the firearm itself. Operator injuries from out-of-battery discharges often include cuts and velocity wounds to the hands, arms, and face. Shooters without eye protection have a high risk of sustaining critical and permanent eye damage from out-of-battery discharges. In some cases, more serious injuries and even death have been caused by out-of-battery discharges. However, in most firearms designs, most of the blast from the cartridge is contained by the receiver and will not seriously injure a shooter with sufficient eye protection, but can be of greater danger to nearby observers especially ones without eye protection. Depending on the design, it is also possible for a semi-automatic handgun to simply not fire upon pulling the trigger when in an out-of-battery state. Some firearms incorporate deliberate design elements to avoid out-of-battery discharges. Out-of-battery discharges almost always involve semi-automatic or fully-automatic firearms, but they are possible with manually operated firearms such as lever-actions and bolt- actions, yet extremely rare. Understanding and identifying out-of-battery conditions before they can result in an out-of-battery discharge is an important safety skill for both shooters and observers.

He was a descendant of Yu Yue, a renowned scholar during the late Qing period, and Yu Pingbo was trained in the Chinese classics from an early age. In 1915, he qualified by examination for a preparatory course at Peking University, where he became one of Hu Shih's most prominent students. In 1917, he married Xu Baoxun (), a gifted female scholar from Hangzhou, and then commenced composing melodies for Kunqu operas. Meanwhile, he temporarily immersed himself in the New Culture Movement, and in 1918 his first New Culture period poem Spring Waters (Êò•Ê∞¥ Ch≈´nshuƒ≠) was published alongside Lu Xun's A Madman's Diary in La Jeunesse, becoming one of the pioneering compositions to be written in contemporary Chinese vernacular. That same year, he established with classmates Fu Sinian, Luo Jialun and others the New Wave Society. Other intellectual friends or writers included Zhu Ziqing, Feng Youlan, and Ye Shengtao. He then went on to publish such compositions as the poem Winter's Night (ÂÜ¨Â§ú D≈çngy√®). Yu Pingbo graduated from Peking University in December, 1919. After graduation, Yu took a brief trip to Europe, and in 1922 spent an equally brief period in the United States, but found neither place attractive. Howard L. Boorman, Biographical Dictionary of Republican China Vol 4 (New York,: Columbia University Press, 1971), pp. 67-70. Career during Republican China In 1923, Yu published Debating Dream of the Red Chamber (Á¥ÖÊ®ìÂ§¢Ëæ® H√≥ngl√≥um√®ng Bi√†n), giving evidence for his claim that only the first eighty chapters of the original Dream of the Red Chamber had been authored by Cao Xueqin, the later forty chapters being penned by Gao E. He thereby came to be known, along with Hu Shih, for establishing a new field in redological studies. These studies were not only important in developing an understanding of the text and its complexities, but in advancing the New Culture Movement's nationalistic project of using scientific methodology to replace old Chinese culture with a westernized version.Louise Edwards, \\"New Hongxue and the 'Birth of the Author': Yu Pingbo's 'On Qin Keqing's Death',\\" Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews (CLEAR) 23 (2001): 31-54. In 1925 he took up post as a lecturer at Yenching University. In 1928 he went to Tsinghua University. In 1935, he founded the Tsinghua Valley Music Society (Ê∏ÖËèØË∞∑Èü≥Á§æ Qinghu√° G≈≠yƒ´nsh√®) Tsinghua to popularise his Kunqu compositions. In 1946, he transferred to Peking University for the post of professor.

People's Republic of China In September 1954, two recent graduates Li Xifan and Lan Ling () published a critique of an article about Dream of the Red Chamber written by Yu. On October 10, their critique of Yu's Study of the Dream of the Red Chamber was published in the major national newspaper Guangming Daily, which criticizes the book for lacking \\"scientific analysis\\" and for failing to notice the \\"great anti-feudal trend\\" represented in the classical novel. Li and Lan's critiques caught the attention of Mao Zedong, who seized the opportunity to launch an attack against Yu, and ultimately, the idealism espoused by the scholar Hu Shih. Mao wrote a letter on 16 October praising Li and Lan's courage for attacking an established authority. The letter was circulated within China's top leadership, and Chinese media began a national campaign praising the \\"nobodies\\" such as Li and Lan while criticizing bourgeois \\"big wigs\\" such as Yu. During the Cultural Revolution, Yu was persecuted and sent to a May Seventh Cadre School in Xi County, Henan for manual labour. He was rehabilitated after Mao's death in 1976. On 15 October 1990, at ninety years of age, he died at his home in Beijing.

The son of a Surakarta courtier in the Dutch East Indies, he showed interest in Javanese literature at an early age, reading from books in the court's collection. Despite attending only primary school, his knowledge of Dutch and Javanese literature allowed him to take a position at the colony's Archaeology Service, and then at Leiden University in the Netherlands. He was allowed to obtain a doctor's degree at Leiden. He then returned to the colony to work at a Batavia (today Jakarta) museum, cataloguing Javanese texts and writing scholarly works. After Indonesia's independence, he became a professor at the universities of Indonesia, Gajah Mada, and Udayana. Names and titles It was common for a Javanese gentleman of Poerbatjaraka's time to change names and be given new titles throughout his life. His birth name was Lesya (also spelled Lesja and Lesyo, meaning \\"funny\\"). When he served at the court he became known as Lesya Atmopradonggo. After his first move to Jakarta, he became known as Poerbatjaraka and later granted the titles Raden and Ngabehi. Subsequently, he was raised to the title of Raden Mas. The spelling of his adult name, \\"Poerbatjaraka\\", was Dutch and the one he always used. In later Indonesian texts his name may be spelled \\"Purbacaraka\\" (using the latest spelling system), or \\"Purbatjaraka\\" (using the Republican Spelling System). The first part of the name, Purba or Poerba, was from Sanskrit purwa (\\"first\\"), and his father's name prefix. The second part, tjaraka or caraka was from hanacaraka, the name of the Javanese script, and was a literary allusion. Early life and family Poerbatjaraka was born as Lesya on 1 January 1884 in Surakarta, the capital of Surakarta Sunanate, a principality which was then part of the Dutch East Indies. He was the eldest son of Raden Tumenggung Purbadipura, a courtier to the Sunan (monarch) Pakubuwana X. Purbadipura was close to the monarch, and took on multiple roles, including those comparable to a European master of the robes, a barber, a divination doctor, and a composer. Lesya attended the Hollands-Indische School (HIS), a primary level, colonial school for Indies natives. He was not given further education, which was common for children in his position. He was interested in Dutch (the language of administration and scholarship at the time) and often talked to Dutch soldiers in his area to learn and practice the language. During his childhood, his love for classical Javanese literature began as he read works found in his father's library. He also read a book on old Javanese literature by the professor Hendrik Kern. It was a gift from a Dutch official to Pakubuwana, who did not read Dutch and gave it to Purbadipura. Once, when literary-minded courtiers had a discussion about Old Javanese poems, his insight from the book allowed him to solve a problem in explaining difficult passages, contradicting the more senior courtiers. This caused him serious trouble as it was not his place to do this. He began to feel uncomfortable at court, and wrote to the Dutch resident (the top colonial official in Surakarta). This correspondence resulted in an appointment in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, with the colony's Archeological Service. Career Dr. G. A. J. Hazeu, for whom Poerbatjaraka worked as an assistant at Leiden University. In 1910, Poerbatjaraka moved to Batavia to take the Archaeology Service position. His knowledge of Javanese literature proved very useful to the institution, and he was often consulted by its staff. During these years he also learned Sanskrit. He took a new name, Poerbatjaraka (Purbacaraka in modern Indonesian spelling) and was given the titles Raden and Ngabehi. After several years in Batavia, he was recruited by Leiden University in the Netherlands. He became assistant to a scholar of Javanese culture Dr. G. A. J. Hazeu, and taught Javanese language classes. Despite not having the prerequisite academic requirements, he was given special dispensation and allowed to pursue a doctorate, which he did without attending lectures. He completed his doctor's degree cum laude in 1926, with his thesis titled \\"Agastya in den Archipel\\" (\\"Agastya in Nusantara\\"). He then returned to Batavia and worked at the Museum of the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences (today the National Museum of Indonesia), and catalogued the museum's large collection of Javanese texts, accumulated over nearly a century. While doing this, he wrote monographs on several groups of manuscripts, containing their Dutch summaries and indexes of names. In Batavia, he also met the future historian of Java, H. J. de Graaf, to whom he gave weekly lessons in Javanese culture and language between 1927 and 1930. De Graaf later considered Poerbatjaraka his \\"revered teacher\\" and praised him for \\"unveil[ing] some of the secrets of your people\\". After Indonesia's independence, he became a professor, teaching at Gajah Mada University in Jogjakarta, University of Indonesia in Jakarta, and Udayana University in Denpasar, Bali. He was one of the founders of Udayana's Literature Department. He continued to write about Javanese history and literature for journals both in Indonesia and the Netherlands. In 1952, he published a collection of his studies in a book entitled Kapustakaan Djawi. He was made an honorary member of the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies in 1963. In 1964, the Indonesian Journal of Cultural Studies published a volume of twenty-six articles in his honour to mark his 80th birthday. On 25 July of the same year, he died in Jakarta.  Scholarly style and works  The Literature Department's faculty building named after Poerbatjaraka at Gajah Mada University, Yogyakarta. With limited formal education, Poerbatjaraka was largely an autodidact. Early in his career, he was criticized as \\"amateurish\\", and lacking a \\"scholarly accurateness\\". According to the Javanese literature scholar Th. Pigaud, he made up for this with his extensive knowledge of Javanese literature, of all things Javanese in general, and by his zeal for Javanese studies. As he matured, he gained respect among both Europeans and his fellow Indonesians. His works combined the scientific method--which was uncommon among Indonesian native authors at his time--with his intimate knowledge of his subjects as an insider. He was often critical of the text and manuscript that he worked on, noticing spelling errors, and preferring to compare multiple sources before publishing a manuscript. Pigeaud said that his works and his behaviour often showed a sense of humour characteristic of a punokawan (jesters in Javanese wayangs). During his retirement in Jakarta, he did not stop working. De Graaf said that during this period he was \\"quietly but indefatigably studying and publishing\\". According to his biography by Indonesia's Education and Cultural Ministry, he published seventy-nine works throughout his life, while Pigeaud put the number at seventy-three. His works focus on epigraphy of old Javanese literature. They were written mostly in Dutch and, after Indonesia's independence in 1945, he also wrote in Indonesian and Javanese. Among his notable works, he published studies on Agastya, the Old Javanese works Smaradahana, Arjunawiwaha, Ramayana and, with C. Hooykaas, the Bharatayudha. His study on the Ramayana established that, based on language, metrics, titles of officials and description of a temple, the Old Javanese version of the epic poem originated at the end of the ninth or the beginning of the tenth century. This finding was later confirmed by other studies, including one by Hooykaas. Later in his career, he published Kapustakan Djawi (\\"Javanese Literature\\"), which surveyed eighty-four old and modern Javanese literary works. He also published what he intended to be the first volume of Riwajat Indonesia (\\"The History of Indonesia\\"), covering the country's history up to the eighth century. No further volume was published until his death. Personal life Poerbatjaraka was married, \\"at a mature age,\\" to a member of the Yogyakarta royal family. A Javanese gentleman of standing, he was proud of his Surakarta heritage. Throughout his life he supported his many relatives.

The station is named after Seremban. The station is served by the KTM ETS train services, as well as the KTM Komuter service introduced in 1995. Since December 2015, the station is served by the Seremban Line which runs between Batu Caves and stations. The station is also the former southern terminus, and namesake, of the KTM Komuter line. History The station was constructed between 1904 and 1910 at a cost of RM26,000.00, having long served earlier railway companies before the Malayan Railway Administration (now known as the Malayan Railway) took over responsibilities of managing all lines in Malaya in 1948. The station continued to offer Intercity train services along the North-South Line, as well as offering goods deliveries. From 6 February 1994 to 12 April 1994, the station underwent extensive remodeling in preparation for the launch of the Rawang-to-Seremban stretch of the KTM Komuter commuter train services. The renovation saw the retrofitting of new KTM Komuter facilities into the station, as well as the raising of all platforms in the station to support easier access in and out of KTM locomotives and coaches. It was the southern terminus of the KTM Komuter's Rawang-Seremban Line since 1995 when the KTM Komuter began serving Seremban, until the service was merged with the KTM Komuter Southern Service resulting in the southern terminus moving first to , Sungai Gadut and then later . Platforms The Seremban railway station, as seen from one of its platforms. Note the line used by a KTM Komuter train (along platform 1), which is frequently used by Komuter trains along the Seremban Line. The station contains three platforms connected by a link bridge. Because the station used to serve as a terminal stop of the KTM Komuter commuter train service, only one line was needed for the service, used as a final stop for its southbound journey and the beginning of its northbound journey (like most EMUs, the KTM Komuter rolling stock is capable of moving backwards or forwards). However, all lines and platforms are currently in use. The northbound trains stop at platform 1, a side platform directly adjoining the station building. Platforms 2 and 3 are situated on an island platform covered by a metal-framed and wooden shade, and serve southbound Komuter and ETS trains. Architecture The station is essentially fashioned in a simplistic form, consisting of an oblong-planned one storey station building containing station offices at the southern half of the station, and ticketing facilities and the passenger concourse in the northern half of the building; a brick-and-plaster entranceway was also included in its earlier iteration. The station features verandahs supported by carved wooden beams sporting curved motives. The station is covered by two layers of hip roofs: One at the bottom cut at the top by a smaller one with a large gable. A white clock tower is erected atop the roof of the building, topped by an onion dome. The top of the roof is adorned by wooden carvings and small pinnacles on its upper ends.

The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the ninth largest in Europe. From a nucleus between the Odra and Vistula rivers on the North-Central European Plain, Poland has at its largest extent expanded as far as the Baltic, the Dnieper, the Black Sea and the Carpathians, while in periods of weakness it has shrunk drastically or even ceased to exist.

The Poles are the most numerous of the West Slavs and occupy what some believe to be the original homeland of the Slavic peoples. While other groups migrated, the Polanie remained in situ along the Vistula, from the river's sources to its estuary at the Baltic Sea. There is no other European nation centred to such an extent on one river. The establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of Christianity by Mieszko I in 966 CE (see Baptism of Poland), when the state covered territory similar to that of present-day Poland. In 1025 CE, Poland became a kingdom. In 1569, Poland cemented a long association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin, forming the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was one of the largest and most populous countries in 16th- and 17th-century Europe.pg 554 ‚Äì Poland-Lithuania was another country that experienced its 'Golden Age' during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The realm of the last Jagiellons was absolutely the largest state in Europe.pg 51 ‚Äì \\"the deluge,\\" denoting the downfall of Poland, at that time the largest state in Europe, stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and from the Oder to the Dnieper River. Territorial changes of Poland from 1635 to 2009 The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth had many characteristics that made it unique among states of that era. The Commonwealth's political system, often called the Noble's Democracy or Golden Freedom, was characterized by the sovereign's power being reduced by laws and the legislature (Sejm), which was controlled by the nobility (szlachta). This system was a precursor to the modern concepts of broader democracypg 3 ‚Äì and constitutional monarchy.pg 84 ‚Äì enabled them to push a new constitution through the Diet, transforming Poland from an anarchic republic ... into a reasonably modern constitutional monarchypg 34 ‚Äì It was Poland more than any other Western European country that became the early symbol of a liberal and constitutional monarchy. The two comprising states of the Commonwealth were formally equal, although in reality Poland was a dominant partner in the union. Its population was hallmarked by a high level of ethnic and confessional diversity, and the state was noted for having religious tolerance unusual for its age,pg 373 ‚Äì Quoting from Sarmatian Review academic journal mission statement: Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was [‚Ä¶] characterized by religious tolerance unusual in pre-modern Europe although the degree of tolerance varied over time.pg 122 ‚Äì [Poland] secured for a time a rule of religious tolerance, particularly in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ... The situation changed, however, toward the end of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the late 18th century, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth began to collapse. Its neighbouring states were able to slowly dismember the Commonwealth. In 1795, Poland's territory was completely partitioned among the Kingdom of Prussia, the Russian Empire, and Austria. Poland regained its independence as the Second Polish Republic in 1918 after World War I, but lost it in World War II through occupation by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Poland lost over six million citizens in World War II, emerging several years later as the socialist People's Republic of Poland within the Eastern Bloc, under strong Soviet influence. During the Revolutions of 1989, communist rule was overthrown and Poland became what is constitutionally known as the \\"Third Polish Republic.\\" Poland is a unitary state made up of sixteen voivodeships (). Poland is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Territorial timeline In the period following the emergence of Poland in the 10th century, the Polish nation was led by a series of rulers of the Piast dynasty, who converted the Poles to Christianity, created a sizeable Central European state, and integrated Poland into European culture. Formidable foreign enemies and internal fragmentation eroded this initial structure in the 13th century, but consolidation in the 14th century laid the base for the Polish Kingdom. Beginning with the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila, the Jagiellon dynasty (1385‚Äì1569) ruled the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union. The Lublin Union of 1569 established the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth as an influential player in European politics and a vital cultural entity. =Duchy of Prussia= In 1525, during the Protestant Reformation, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Albert of Hohenzollern, secularized the order's Prussian territory, becoming Albert, Duke of Prussia. The Duchy of Prussia, which had its capital in K√∂nigsberg, was established as a fief of the Crown of Poland. =Duchy of Courland and Semigallia= The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was a vassal state of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom from 1569 to 1726, and incorporated into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1726. In 1561, during the Livonian Wars, the Livonian Confederation was dismantled and the Livonian Order, an order of German knights, was disbanded. On the basis of the Treaty of Vilnius, the southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and formed into the Ducatus Ultradunensis (PƒÅrdaugavas hercogiste).

He was responsible for the introduction and subsequent spread of Christianity in Poland. During his long reign most of the territories inhabited by Polish tribes and other West Slavs were temporarily added to his territory into a single Polish state, soon to be independent again. The last of his conquests were Silesia and Lesser Poland that were incorporated some time before 990.Andrzej Buko, \\"Archeologia Polski wczesno≈õredniowiecznej\\", 2007, Ed.

Labuda, Mieszko I, p. 171. =1025= Poland during the reign of Boles≈Çaw the Brave During the reign of Boles≈Çaw the Brave, relations between Poland and the Holy Roman Empire deteriorated, resulting in a series of wars (1002‚Äì1005, 1007‚Äì1013, 1015‚Äì1018). From 1003‚Äì1004 Boles≈Çaw intervened militarily in Czech dynastic conflicts. After his forces were removed from Bohemia in 1018,Makk, Ferenc (1993).

In 1013 the marriage between Boles≈Çaw's son Mieszko and Richeza of Lotharingia, the niece of Emperor Otto III and future mother of Casimir I the Restorer, took place. The conflicts with Germany ended in 1018 with the Peace of Bautzen accord, on favorable terms for Boles≈Çaw. In the context of the 1018 Kiev expedition, Boles≈Çaw took over the western part of Red Ruthenia. In 1025, shortly before his death, Boles≈Çaw I the Brave finally succeeded in obtaining the papal permission to crown himself, and became the first king of Poland.Various authors, ed.

Deprived of a government, Poland was ravaged by an anti-feudal and pagan rebellion, and in 1039 by the forces of Bretislaus I of Bohemia. The country suffered territorial losses, and the functioning of the Gniezno archdiocese was disrupted.Various authors, ed. Marek Derwich and Adam ≈ªurek, U ≈∫r√≥de≈Ç Polski (do roku 1038) (Foundations of Poland (until year 1038)), pp. 182‚Äì187, Andrzej Pleszczy≈Ñski After returning from exile in 1039, Duke Casimir I (1016‚Äì1058), properly known as the Restorer, rebuilt the Polish monarchy and the country's territorial integrity through several military campaigns: in 1047, Masovia was taken back from Miec≈Çaw, and in 1050 Silesia from the Czechs. Casimir was aided by the recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland. Casimir's son Boles≈Çaw II the Generous managed to restore most of the country's strength and influence and was able to crown himself king in 1076. In 1079 there was an anti-Boles≈Çaw conspiracy or conflict that involved the Bishop of Cracow. Boles≈Çaw had Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepan√≥w executed; subsequently Boles≈Çaw was forced to abdicate the Polish throne because of the pressure from the Catholic Church and the pro-imperial faction of the nobility. The rule over Poland passed into the hands of his younger brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw Herman. =1125= Poland during the rule of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth After a power struggle, Boles≈Çaw III the Wry-mouthed (son of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Herman, ruled 1102‚Äì1138) became the Duke of Poland by defeating his half-brother in 1106‚Äì1107. Boles≈Çaw's major achievement was the reconquest of all of Mieszko I's Pomerania, a task begun by his father and completed by Boles≈Çaw around 1123. Szczecin was subdued in a bloody takeover and Western Pomerania up to R√ºgen, except for the directly incorporated southern part, became Boles≈Çaw's fief,Atlas historyczny Polski (Atlas of Polish History), 14th edition, , PPWK Warszawa‚ÄìWroc≈Çaw 1998, p. 5 to be ruled locally by Wartislaw I, the first duke of the Griffin dynasty.

By issuing it, Boles≈Çaw planned to guarantee that his heirs would not fight among themselves, and would preserve the unity of his lands under the House of Piast. However, he failed; soon after his death his sons fought each other, and Poland entered a period of fragmentation lasting about 200 years.Norman Davies, God's Playground, page: 60 =1238= Monarchy of the Silesian Henries. In the first half of the 13th century Silesian duke Henry I the Bearded, reunited much of the divided Kingdom of Poland (Regnum Poloniae). His expeditions led him as far north as the Duchy of Pomerania, where for a short time he held some of its southern areas.Benedykt Zientara, Stanis≈Çaw Smolka, Peter Oliver Loew, Heinrich der b√§rtige und seine Zeit: Politik und Gesellschaft im mittelalterlichen Schlesien, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2002, p. 338, He became the duke of Cracow (Polonia Minor) in 1232, which gave him the title of senior duke of Poland (see Testament of Boles≈Çaw III Krzywousty), and came into possession of most of Greater Poland in 1234. Henry failed in his attempt to achieve the Polish crown. His activity in this field was continued by his son and successor Henry II the Pious, until his sudden death in 1241 (Battle of Legnica). His successors were not able to maintain their holdings outside of Silesia, which were lost to other Piast dukes. Polish historians refer to territories acquired by Silesian dukes in this period as Monarchia Henryk√≥w ≈õlƒÖskich (\\"The monarchy of the Silesian Henries\\"). In those days Wroc≈Çaw was the political center of the divided Kingdom of Poland. =1248= Few years after the death of Henry II the Pious his son ‚Äì Boles≈Çaw II the Bald ‚Äì sold the northwest part of his duchy ‚Äì the Lubusz Land ‚Äì to Magdeburg's Archbishop Wilbrand von K√§fernburg and the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. This had far reaching negative consequences for the integrity of the western border, leading to an expansion of Brandenburg possessions into the east of Odra river. As a result, a wide piece of land was annexed from Poland and Pomerania that together with Lubusz Land formed the newly established Brandenburgian province of Neumark.Wiktor Fenrych, Nowa Marchia w dziejach politycznych Polski w XIII i w XIV wiekuPozna≈Ñ 1959, p. 5 =1295= Poland in the times of Przemys≈Ç In 1295, Przemys≈Ç II of Greater Poland became the first, since Boles≈Çaw II, Piast duke crowned as King of Poland, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including from 1294 Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. =1300= leftthumb225pxPoland in the times of Wenceslaus II: A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, Wenceslaus II of Bohemia of the P≈ôemyslid dynasty, who married Przemys≈Ç's daughter and became King of Poland in 1300. V√°clav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305. =1333‚Äì70= Poland during the reign of Casimir the Great After the death of Wenceslaus III of Bohemia ‚Äì son of Wenceslaus II ‚Äì in 1306, most of the Polish Lands came under the rule of duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. However at this points, various foreign states were staking their claims on some parts of Poland. Margraviate of Brandenburg invaded Pomerelia in 1308, leading W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high to request assistance from the Teutonic Knights, who evicted the Brandenburgers but took the area for themselves, annexed and incorporated it into the Teutonic Order state in 1309 (Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) and Treaty of Soldin/My≈õlib√≥rz). This event caused a long-lasting dispute between Poland and the Teutonic Order over the control of Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania. It resulted in a series of Polish‚ÄìTeutonic Wars throughout 14th and 15th centuries. During this time, all Silesian dukes accepted W≈Çadys≈Çaw's claims for sovereignty over other Piasts. After acquiring papal consent for his coronation, all nine dukes of Silesia declared twice (in 1319 before and in 1320 after the coronation) that their realms lay inside the borders of the Polish Kingdom.Rudolf ≈Ω√°ƒçek [in:] J. Bahlacke, D. Gawrecki, R. Kaczmarek (red.) Historia G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska, Gliwice 2011, p. 114-115, , , However, despite formal papal consent for the coronation, W≈Çadys≈Çaw's right to the crown was disputed by successors of Wenceslaus III (a king of both Bohemia and Poland) on the Bohemian throne. In 1327 John of Bohemia invaded. After the intervention of King Charles I of Hungary he left Polonia Minor, but on his way back he enforced his supremacy over the Upper Silesian Piasts. In 1329 W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high fought with the Teutonic Order. The Order was supported by John of Bohemia who dominated the dukes of Masovia and Lower Silesia. In 1335 John of Bohemia renounced his claim in favour of Casimir the Great, who in return renounced his claims to the Silesia province.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Silesia This was formalized in the Treaty of Trentschin and Congress of Visegr√°d (1335), ratified in 1339 and later confirmed in the 1348 Treaty of Namslau. King Casimir, being deprived of historically and ethnically Polish lands of Silesia and Pomerelia sought a compensation of this loses in the east. Through a series of military campaigns between 1340 and 1366 Casimir had annexed the Halych‚ÄìVolodymyr area of Rus'. The city of Lw√≥w quickly developed to become a main town of this new region. Allied with Denmark and Western Pomerania, Casimir was able to impose some corrections on the western border as well. In 1365 Drezdenko and Santok became Poland's fiefs, while Wa≈Çcz district was in 1368 taken outright, severing the land connection between Brandenburg and the Teutonic state and connecting Poland with Farther Pomerania.

Warsaw's viewpoint the alliance made sense, but the sejm's refusal to pay Prussia's price for it ... made it of problematic value. The conditions of the Pact were such that the succeeding and final two partitions of Poland were inevitable. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of Poland's neighbours, wary of a potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. In the second partition, Russia and Prussia took so much territory that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland.pg 101‚Äì103 ‚Äì - the Prussians and the Russians signed a second treaty of Partition in St Petersburg on 23 January 1793.

An alliance of convenience was the result of this situation. Volunteer Polish legions attached themselves to Bonaparte's armies, hoping that in return the emperor would allow an independent Poland to reappear out of his conquests. The Duchy of Warsaw was a Polish state established by Napoleon in 1807 from the Polish lands ceded by the Kingdom of Prussia under the terms of the Treaties of Tilsit. The duchy was held in personal union by one of Napoleon's allies, King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. Free City of Danzig (Napoleonic) Prussia had acquired the City of Danzig in the course of the Second Partition of Poland in 1793.

Polish‚ÄìSoviet War White and green stripes indicate the farthest the Russians were able to advance and the farthest the Poles were able to attack into Russia during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War The Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (February 1919 ‚Äì March 1921) was an armed conflict between Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine on the one hand and the Second Polish Republic and the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic on the other. The war was the result of conflicting expansionist ambitions. Poland, whose statehood had just been re-established by the Treaty of Versailles following the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, sought to secure territories it had lost at the time of the partitions. The aim of the Soviet states was to control those same territories, which the Russian Empire had gained in the partitions of Poland.Chapter \\"The Russo-Polish War\\" ‚Äì File:PBW March 1919.svgMarch 1919 File:PBW December 1919.pngDecember 1919 File:PBW June 1920.pngJune 1920 File:PBW August 1920.pngAugust 1920 File:Rzeczpospolita 1938.svgTreaty of Riga =1920= Free City of Danzig The Free City of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) was created on 15 November 1920 in accordance with the terms of Article 100 (Section XI of Part III) of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. As the Treaty stated, the region was to remain separated from Germany and from Poland, but it was not an independent state. The Free City was under League of Nations protection and put into a binding customs union with Poland. Poland was given full rights to develop and maintain transportation, communication, and port facilities in the city. The Free City was created in order to give Poland access to a good-sized seaport. Lithuanian land claims  Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War  Treaty of Riga not signed The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War was an armed conflict between Lithuania and the Second Polish Republic, lasting from August 1920 to October 7, 1920, in the aftermath of World War I, not long after both countries had regained their independence. It was part of a wider conflict over disputed territorial control of the cities of Vilnius (), Suwa≈Çki () and August√≥w (). In the aftermath of the war the Republic of Central Lithuania was created in 1920 following the staged rebellion of soldiers of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division of the Polish Army, supported by the Polish air force, cavalry and artillery. Centered on the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vilna (, ), for eighteen months the entity served as a buffer state between Poland, upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area. Negotiations with Russia Russian-Polish border agreed to on 18 October 1920. Soon after the Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace. The Poles, exhausted, constantly pressured by the Western governments and the League of Nations, and with its army controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. The Soviets made two offers: one on September 21 and the other on September 28. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on October 2. On the October 5, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer, which Poland accepted. The armistice between Poland on the one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on October 12 and went into effect on October 18. Long negotiations ensued, with the Treaty of Riga being signed in March 1921. The assessment of relative advantage is not universally agreed. Outcome assessments vary, mostly between calling the result a Polish victory and being inconclusive, with the latter mostly by Soviet-era Russian historians. However, in his secret report to the 9th Conference of the Bolshevik Party on 20 September 1920, Lenin called the outcome of the war \\"In a word, a gigantic, unheard-of defeat\\",ÔΩêÔΩá 106 ‚Äì considering he wanted to reach the German communist revolutionaries to aid them and establish a socialist marxist republic there. Negotiations with Czechoslovakia Territory adjustments between Czechoslovakia (green) and Poland (red). During the closing years of World War I Polish and Czechoslovak diplomats met to arrange a common border between the two new countries. By the time armistice was declared, most of the border was agreed except for three small politically sensitive areas with both Polish and Czechoslovak residents. ;The Duchy of Cieszyn The Cieszyn Silesia or the Duchy of Cieszyn ( and ) was a small area that the pre-World War I census showed was predominantly Polish in three districts (Teschen, Bielsko and Frysztat) and mainly Czech in the fourth district of Frydek. The economic importance of Cieszyn Silesia lay in the rich coal basin around Karvina and in the valuable Ko≈°ice‚ÄìBohum√≠n Railway, which linked Bohemia with Slovakia. In northern Cieszyn Silesia, the railroad junction of Bohum√≠n ( and ) served as a crossroads for international transport and communications.p. 75 ‚Äì Duchy of Cieszyn ( and ) was a small area ... on the eve of the First World War its population was predominantly Polish in three districts (Teschen, Bielsko and Frysztat) and mainly Czech in the fourth district of Frydek.

Claims over these regions turned violent in 1919 with a brief military conflict, the Seven-day war, between Polish and Czechoslovak units. The Allied governments pressed for a ceasefire and on 3 February 1919 a Polish‚ÄìCzech border agreement was signed on the basis of the 5 November 1918 ethnic division agreement. This was later changed at the Conference of Ambassadors in Spa, Belgium on 28 July 1920. Cieszyn () was divided along the Olza river between the two newly created states of Poland and Czechoslovakia. The smaller western suburbs of Cieszyn were joined to Czechoslovakia as the new town of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n along with the railroad and the Karvina coal basin.p. 382 ‚Äì Cieszyn ‚Äì City on the border of Poland and Czechoslovakia , subject of a Polish‚ÄìCzech conflict in 1919. The conflict was resolved by a decision of the Conference of Ambassadors (28 July 1920), which divided the city into a Polish part (Cieszyn) and a Czech part (Tesin). A treaty between Poland and Czechoslovakia on the community of Cieszyn was signed on 21 December 1920. The entire town was within the borders of Poland from 11 October 1938 to 1 September 1939 as a result of the Munich Agreement in 1938. After World War II the division of Cieszyn as of 1920 was restored. Poland received the portion of Cieszyn east of the Olza river. The Conference of Ambassadors divided the region just as the Red Army was nearing Warsaw. It was later learned that this award resulted from a secret deal between Edvard Bene≈° and French and British officials.ÔΩêg 52 ‚Äì ;Orawa and Spisz The county of Orawa () arose before the 15th century. The county's territory is situated along the Orava River between Zazriva and the Tatra Mountains.

While the Orawa and Spisz border was in arbitration, many groups fought to be a part of Poland, including a number of Polish authors. They began to write about an alleged three hundred thousand Poles living in the Orawa territory. The Conference of Ambassadors decided that Czechoslovakia would cede to Poland a number of villages from the Orawa and Spisz regions, including the municipalities of Oravy Srnie, Podvlk, Harkab√∫z, Ni≈æn√° Zubrica, Vy≈°n√° Zubrica, Oravka, Bukovina-Podsklie, Pekeln√≠k, Jablonka, Chy≈æn√©, Hladovka, Such√° Hora, Vy≈°n√° Lipnica, a part of Ni≈æn√© Lipnice and 4.2% of the rather Bel√° new communities, with Fridman (Fal≈°tin settlement), Krempach, Trib≈°, Dur≈°t√≠n, ƒåierna Hora, Jurgov, Repisk√°, Vy≈°n√© lapse, Ni≈æn√© lapse, Nedeca, Kacv√≠n and Lap≈°anka. =1921= Upper Silesian industrial district (red) to Poland after the Upper Silesia plebiscite in 1921 In late 1921 a border adjustment between the Weimar Republic and Poland took place as a result of the Silesian Uprisings. The uprising were a series of three armed rebellions that took place between 1919 and 1921 by the Polish people in the Upper Silesia region against the Weimar Republic. The Polish people of the region wanted to join the Second Polish Republic, which had been established following World War I. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles had called for a plebiscite in Upper Silesia in 1921 to determine whether the territory should be a part of Germany or Poland. The plebiscite took place on March 20, 1921, two days after the signing of the Treaty of Riga, which ended the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. In the plebiscite, 707,605 votes were cast for Germany, and 479,359 for Poland. The Germans had a majority, by 228,246 votes. In late April 1921, rumours flew that Upper Silesia would stay in Germany. This led to the Third Polish Uprising in May‚ÄìJuly 1921. The question of the Upper Silesia problem was turned over to a council of the League of Nations. The commission, consisting of four representatives‚Äîone each from Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and China. The commission gathered its own data, interviewing Poles and Germans from the region. On the basis of the reports of this commission and those of its experts, in October 1921 the Council awarded the greater part of the Upper Silesian industrial district to Poland. =1922= alt=Territorial changes of Poland, 1922. After a variety of delays, a disputed election to join Poland took place on January 8, 1922, and the Republic of Central Lithuania became part of Poland, establishing the geography of Poland's eastern Kresy region until the Invasion of Poland in 1939. =1924= Lipnica Wielka (red) went to Poland and Such√° Hora and Hladovka (green) went to Czechoslovakia.

As Czechoslovakia was being absorbed into the German Reich, Zaolzie, the Czech half of Cieszyn, was annexed by Poland in 1938 following the Munich Agreement and the First Vienna Award. At noon on September 30, Poland gave an ultimatum to the Czechoslovak government. It demanded the immediate evacuation of Czech troops and police from Zaolzie and gave Prague until noon the following day. At 11:45 a.m. on October 1 the Czech foreign ministry called the Polish ambassador in Prague and told him that Poland could have what it wanted. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of Nazi Germany.ÔΩêg 386 ‚Äì The dismemberment of Czechoslovakia Poland seized land from northern Spisz and northern Orawa, including territories around Such√° Hora and Hladovka, around Javorina, around Le≈õnica in the Pieniny Mountains, a small territory around Skalit√©, and some other very small border regions. They officially received the territories on 1 November 1938. Polish military groups began to carry out assimilation of the population. Polish was introduced as the only official language and the Slovak Intelligence were displaced from the territories. =1939= alt=Territorial changes of Poland 1939 World War II In 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland and partitioned it pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. After the invasion, Germany annexed the lands it lost to reformed Poland in 1919‚Äì1922 by the Treaty of Versailles: the Polish Corridor, West Prussia, the Province of Posen, and parts of eastern Upper Silesia. The council of the Free City of Danzig voted to become a part of Germany again, although Poles and Jews were deprived of their voting rights and all non-Nazi political parties were banned. Parts of Poland that had not been part of Wilhelmine Germany were also incorporated into the Reich. Two decrees by Adolf Hitler (October 8 and October 12, 1939) provided for the division of the annexed areas of Poland into the following administrative units: * Reichsgau Wartheland (initially Reichsgau Posen), which included the entire Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship, most of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship, five counties of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, and one county of the Warszawa Voivodeship; *Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia (initially Reichsgau West Prussia), which consisted of the remaining area of the Pomeranian Voivodeship and the Free City of Danzig; * Ciechan√≥w District (Regierungsbezirk Zichenau), consisting of the five northern counties of Warszawa Voivodeship (P≈Çock, P≈Ço≈Ñsk, Sierpc, Ciechan√≥w, and M≈Çawa), which became a part of East Prussia; * Katowice District (Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz), or unofficially East Upper Silesia (Ost- Oberschlesien), which included Sosnowiec, Bƒôdzin, Chrzan√≥w, and Zawiercie Counties, and parts of Olkusz and ≈ªywiec Counties. USSR and Nazi Germany carve up Poland These territories had an area of and a population of 10,000,000 people. The remaining Polish territory was annexed by the Soviet Union or made into the German-controlled General Government occupation zone. Eastern areas of Poland became part of either Soviet Belarus (including Bia≈Çystok, ≈Åom≈ºa, Baranowicze and Brest) or Soviet Ukraine (including Lw√≥w, Tarnopol, Lutsk, Rowne and Stanis≈Çaw√≥w). The city of Vilnius (Polish: Wilno) with its adjacent area was annexed and returned to Lithuania.

At the end of World War II, the Allies formally accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. There were extensive changes to the territorial extent of Poland, following the decision taken at the Tehran Conference of 1943 at the insistence of the Soviet Union. The Polish territories east of the Curzon Line (known as the Kresy), which the Soviet Union had occupied in 1939 along with the Bialystok region were permanently annexed, resulting in Poland losing over 20% of its pre-war borders.pÔΩá 47 ‚Äì While a large portion of this area was predominately populated by Ukrainians and Belarusians, most of their Polish inhabitants were expelled.pg 7 ‚Äì 24 ‚Äì Today these territories are part of Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania.

On May 20, 1945, in Trstena an agreement for a return to the 1938 borders of Poland was signed and the following day the Czechoslovak border guards moved to the old Czechoslovak border. At several places there were fights between Polish and Czechoslovak militias, but the situation calmed with the arrival of Polish troops on July 17, 1945. The Polish government still did not want to give up Zaolzie, and on June 16, 1945, Marshall Micha≈Ç Rola-≈ªymierski issued directive number 00336, which ordered the 1st Armoured Corps of the Polish Army to concentrate in the area of Rybnik, and to seize Zaolzie. However, the Soviets decided to hand the region to Czechoslovakia, and the Poles followed the Moscow directive.

U.S. Army Map Service, 1958 The mountain has been heavily entrenched with Syrian government forces since the start of the Syrian Civil War, as it is a strategic site in the battle for the outskirts of Damascus. Sam Dagher, 'Assad Readies for U.S. Strike Despite Delay', The Wall Street Journal, Tuesday, September 3, 2013, p. A6 The mountain is also host to an endemic species of iris, Iris damascena, which can be found on the steep eastern slopes, at an altitude of above sea level. The Syrian government has not given the species any protected status. Its only benefiting factor was that part of the habitat of the species lies within a military area near the 'Qassioun Republican Guards Military Base' and other military facilities, which prevents civilians from accessing the area. The base and steepness of the habitat also prevents construction or development, but it is still classified as Critically endangered.

It is said to have been inhabited at one point by the first human-being, Adam; and there are various stories told about IbrƒÅhƒ´m (Abraham), and 'ƒ™sƒÅ (Jesus) also having prayed in it. It is mentioned however in Medieval Arab history books as having been the place where QƒÅbƒ´l (Cain) killed HƒÅbƒ´l (Abel). It was known for hundreds of years as a place where prayers were immediately accepted, and especially in times of drought rulers of Damascus would climb to the cave and pray for rain.

On another flank of the same mountain is yet another cave, which has come down in local legend as being the cave of the Seven Sleepers, mentioned in early Christian sources, as well as in the Quran,Quran 18:7-26 where they are known as the A·π£·∏•ƒÅb al-Kahf (Companions of the Cave). This is rather dubious, however, and it is only one of many caves in this part of the world that share the claim. A madrassah has been built over the cave, but pilgrims are still granted access.

It is the oldest operating arts and crafts colony in America. The Arts and Crafts movement arose in the late nineteenth century in reaction to the dehumanizing monotony and standardization of industrial production. Byrdcliffe was created as an experiment in utopian living inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement. The colony is still in operation today and is located on with 35 original buildings, all designed in the Arts and Crafts style. There is a self-guided walking tour through the compound as well as a hiking path that leads to the mountain top which gives way to scenic Catskill views. The colony continues to foster the development of artistic vision. Along with ongoing music, theater and art performances held in the Byrdcliffe Theater, Barn and on property lawns, The Byrdcliffe Colony hosts an Artist-In- Residence program that houses over 70 artists each summer who practice in a wide variety of fields and media. The program accepts writers, composers, and visual artists. Byrdcliffe maintains an exhibition and performance space in the heart of Woodstock, the Kleinert/James Center for the Arts, which hosts 6 or 7 exhibitions of primarily contemporary art annually. Location Woodstock is surrounded by the Catskill Mountains of New York State. The entire Byrdcliffe estate lay on 1,500 acres (6 km¬≤) on the south-facing side of Mount Guardian, just above Woodstock. This location provides the rustic landscape meant to inspire and elevate the art community. Additionally, Woodstock offers close proximity to the art and culture of New York CityWoodstock Byrdcliffe Guild Retrieved December 29, 2010 and was home to well-known painters like Milton Avery and Philip Guston. History For many years, Whitehead held the idea of creating an Arts and Crafts community where all the arts would come together, including painting, sculpture, music, metalwork, and furniture making. After a failed attempt to establish a community near Santa Barbara, California and Albany, Oregon, he scouted the East Coast for a suitable site, sending painter and lithographer Bolton Brown on a three-week excursion through the Hudson Valley, where he would select Woodstock, New York and begin construction.Murphy, John. \\"Athletic Aesthetics: Art, Craft and Bolton Brown,\\" Art in Print Vol. 7 No. 2 (July‚ÄìAugust 2017). The Byrdcliffe Arts Colony received its name as a combination of Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead's middle name and his wife's, Jane Byrd McCall Whitehead, middle name. Artists, writers, musicians, social reformers, and intellectuals came from across the country to stay at Byrdcliffe and gain inspiration from the setting and people with shared artistic goals. Facilities included studios for painting, weaving, pottery, metalwork, woodworking; cottages with bathrooms and sleeping porches; a library, and a rambling villa for Whitehead and his family. He built \\"White Pines\\" as his residence with a skylit cathedral ceilinged weaving room overlooking a picturesque view across the Woodstock Valley. Writer Hervey White had been an early founder and worker at Byrdcliffe Colony and he was one of the first to leave and start a new, nearby colony independently. The Byrdcliffe Colony had been \\"well-financed and run somewhat autocratically\\" with a strong sense of designing and planning a legacy and Maverick Artist Colony was more \\"scruffier, more truly communal and anarchic\\". The artist colony of Byrdcliffe failed to fulfill its goals as a self-sufficient arts community. It became too expensive and Ralph Whitehead's dominating personality became a confining force. Byrdcliffe survived for almost 30 years under Whitehead's vision until his death in 1929. After Ralph Whitehead's death in 1929, his widow, Jane, and son Peter struggled to keep the colony alive. After Jane's death in 1955, Peter sold much of the land to pay taxes and maintenance on the heart of the colony which he kept intact. The Whiteheads intended to preserve Byrdcliffe \\"for the purpose of promoting among the residents of Woodstock...the study, practice and development of skill in the fine arts and crafts, as well as a true appreciation thereof...\\" Although the arts and crafts utopian experiment soon ran out of steam, the continuing magic of Byrdcliffe enthralled many notable people including the educator John Dewey, author Thomas Mann and naturalist John Burroughs. Isadora Duncan danced at White Pines; Bob Dylan lived in a house at Byrdcliffe in the '60s and early '70s; Joanne Woodward was involved in the River Arts Repertory at the Byrdcliffe Theatre. Artist In Residence program The Artist in Residence program has operated at Byrdcliffe for approximately 20 years and now hosts over 75 artists throughout four summer sessions. Artists live either in two large communal buildings, or in independent cottages, fostering a creative community as originally intended by the founders. There are numerous large work spaces and studios in multiple buildings on the property. The program sees an especially large influx of practicing visual artists, as well as published writers, college professors and professional composers, looking for retreat time to concentrate on their work. Facilities open for use by Byrdcliffe artists are a ceramics studio, jewelry making studio, darkroom, and large performance spaces such as the Byrdcliffe Theater and the Barn. Composers work in a small studio with a 1905 Steinway upright piano. Merger with Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen Upon Peter Whitehead's death in 1975, Byrdcliffe was left to the Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen which has continued to maintain and administer programs at the colony. In 1979, the Byrdcliffe Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its historical and architectural significance. Byrdcliffe's cottages have been rented since 1984 only to working artists, maintaining sympathy with the founder's creative vision. Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild Byrdcliffe is now owned by the Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild (WBG), a non-profit multi-arts organization with over 600 members. WBG's Kleinert/James Center for the Arts hosts local and national performing, visual, and literary artists. The WBG offers a variety of classes in the arts. Byrdcliffe is an important regional example of the movement to create utopian enclaves in America and continues as a place for artists to gain inspiration, live, and work.

It is intimately connected (by duality) to coloring planar graphs.  Definitions  Let G = (V,E) be a digraph and let M be an abelian group. A map œÜ: E ‚Üí M is an M-circulation if for every vertex v ‚àà V :\\\\sum_{e \\\\in \\\\delta^+(v)} \\\\phi(e) = \\\\sum_{e \\\\in \\\\delta^-(v)} \\\\phi(e), where Œ¥+(v) denotes the set of edges out of v and Œ¥‚àí(v) denotes the set of edges into v. Sometimes, this condition is referred to as Kirchhoff's law. If œÜ(e) ‚â† 0 for every e ‚àà E, we call œÜ a nowhere-zero flow, an M-flow, or an NZ-flow. If k is an integer and 0 < œÜ(e) < k then œÜ is a k-flow. = Other notions = Let G = (V,E) be an undirected graph. An orientation of E is a modular k-flow if for every vertex v ‚àà V we have: :\\\\delta^+(v) \\\\equiv \\\\delta^-(v) \\\\bmod k.  Properties  * The set of M-flows does not necessarily form a group as the sum of two flows on one edge may add to 0. * (Tutte 1950) A graph G has an M-flow if and only if it has a M-flow. As a consequence, a \\\\Z_k flow exists if and only if a k-flow exists. As a consequence G admits a k-flow then it admits an h-flow where h \\\\geq k. * Orientation independence. Modify a nowhere- zero flow œÜ on a graph G by choosing an edge e, reversing it, and then replacing œÜ(e) with ‚àíœÜ(e). After this adjustment, œÜ is still a nowhere-zero flow. Furthermore, if œÜ was originally a k-flow, then the resulting œÜ is also a k-flow. Thus, the existence of a nowhere-zero M-flow or a nowhere-zero k-flow is independent of the orientation of the graph. Thus, an undirected graph G is said to have a nowhere-zero M-flow or nowhere-zero k-flow if some (and thus every) orientation of G has such a flow.  Flow polynomial  Let N_M(G) be the number of M-flows on G. It satisfies the deletion‚Äìcontraction formula: :N_M(G) = N_M(G/ e) - N_M(G\\\\setminus e). Combining this with induction we can show N_M(G) is a polynomial in M-1 where M is the order of the group M. We call N_M(G) the flow polynomial of G and abelian group M. The above implies that two groups of equal order have an equal number of NZ flows. The order is the only group parameter that matters, not the structure of M. In particular N_{M_1}(G) = N_{M_2}(G) if M_1 = M_2. The above results were proved by Tutte in 1953 when he was studying the Tutte polynomial, a generalization of the flow polynomial.  Flow-coloring duality  =Bridgeless Planar Graphs= There is a duality between k-face colorings and k-flows for bridgeless planar graphs. To see this, let G be a directed bridgeless planar graph with a proper k-face-coloring with colors \\\\\\\\{0, 1, \\\\ldots, k-1\\\\\\\\}. Construct a map :\\\\phi: E(G)\\\\to \\\\\\\\{-(k-1), \\\\ldots, -1, 0, 1, \\\\ldots, k-1\\\\\\\\} by the following rule: if the edge e has a face of color x to the left and a face of color y to the right, then let œÜ(e) = x ‚Äì y. Then œÜ is a (NZ) k-flow since x and y must be different colors. So if G and G* are planar dual graphs and G* is k-colorable (there is a coloring of the faces of G), then G has a NZ k-flow. Using induction on E(G) Tutte proved the converse is also true. This can be expressed concisely as: :\\\\chi(G^*) = \\\\phi(G), where the RHS is the flow number, the smallest k for which G permits a k-flow. = General Graphs= The duality is true for general M-flows as well: * Let c the be face-coloring function with values in M. * Define \\\\phi_c(e) = c(r_1) - c(r_2) where r1 is the face to the left of e and r2 is to the right. * For every M-circulation \\\\phi there is a coloring function c such that \\\\phi = \\\\phi_c (proven by induction). * c is a E(G)-face-coloring if and only if \\\\phi_c is a NZ M-flow (straightforward). The duality follows by combining the last two points. We can specialize to M = \\\\Z_k to obtain the similar results for k-flows discussed above. Given this duality between NZ flows and colorings, and since we can define NZ flows for arbitrary graphs (not just planar), we can use this to extend face-colorings to non-planar graphs.  Applications  * G is 2-face-colorable if and only if every vertex has even degree (consider NZ 2-flows). * Let K = \\\\Z_2 \\\\times \\\\Z_2 be the Klein-4 group. Then a cubic graph has a K-flow if and only if it is 3-edge- colorable. As a corollary a cubic graph that is 3-edge colorable is 4-face colorable. *A graph is 4-face colorable if and only if it permits a NZ 4-flow (see Four color theorem). The Petersen graph does not have a NZ 4-flow, and this led to the 4-flow conjecture (see below). * If G is a triangulation then G is 3-(vertex) colorable if and only if every vertex has even degree. By the first bullet, the dual graph G* is 2-colorable and thus bipartite and planar cubic. So G* has a NZ 3-flow and is thus 3-face colorable, making G 3-vertex colorable. * Just as no graph with a loop edge has a proper vertex coloring, no graph with a bridge can have a NZ M-flow for any group M. Conversely, every bridgeless graph has a NZ \\\\Z-flow (a form of Robbins' theorem).For a stronger result on the enumeration of \\\\Z-flows with a bound on the maximum flow amount per edge, again using Robbins' theorem on totally cyclic orientations, see Theorem 2 of  Existence of k-flows  Interesting questions arise when trying to find nowhere-zero k-flows for small values of k. The following have been proven: :Jaeger's 4-flow Theorem. Every 4-edge-connected graph has a 4-flow.F. Jaeger, Flows and generalized coloring theorems in graphs, J. Comb. Theory Set. B, 26 (1979), 205‚Äì216. :Seymour's 6-flow Theorem. Every bridgeless graph has a 6-flow.P. D. Seymour, Nowhere-zero 6-flows, J. Comb. Theory Ser B, 30 (1981), 130‚Äì135. = 4-flow and 5-flow conjectures = As of 2019, the following are currently unsolved (due to Tutte): :5-flow Conjecture. Every bridgeless graph has a 5-flow.5-flow conjecture, Open Problem Garden. :4-flow Conjecture. Every bridgeless graph that does not have the Petersen graph as a minor has a 4-flow.4-flow conjecture, Open Problem Garden. The converse of the 4-flow Conjecture does not hold since the complete graph K11 contains a Petersen graph and a 4-flow. For bridgeless cubic graphs with no Petersen minor, 4-flows exist by the snark theorem (Seymour, et al 1998, not yet published). The four color theorem is equivalent to the statement that no snark is planar.

The mosque is considered to have the most elaborate display of tile work in South Asia, and is also notable for its geometric brick work - a decorative element that is unusual for Mughal- period mosques. It was built during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, who bestowed it to the city as a token of gratitude, and is heavily influenced by Central Asian architecture - a reflection of Shah Jahan's campaigns near Samarkand shortly before the mosque was designed. Location The mosque is located in eastern Thatta - the capital of Sindh in the 16th and 17th centuries before Sindh's capital was shifted to nearby Hyderabad. It is located near the Makli Necropolis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The site is approximately 100 kilometres from Karachi. Background The mosque's tile work exhibits Timurid influences introduced during Shah Jahan's campaigns in Central Asia. Shah Jahan sought refuge in Thatta from his father Emperor Jahangir, after he had rebelled against his father. Shah Jahan was impressed by the hospitality he received by the Sindhi people, and ordered construction of the mosque as a token of gratitude. Construction of the mosque may have also been partially motivate by a desire to help alleviate the effects of a devastating storm that impacted the region in 1637, and which had nearly destroyed Thatta. Shah Jahan's campaigns in Central Asia during this era influenced the mosque's architectural style, as Timurid influences were introduced into the Mughal Empire as his armies pressed towards Samarkand, in modern-day Uzbekistan. Despite the fact that the Emperor was not in the region during its construction, and so was unlikely directly involved in its construction, its profuse tile-work and intricate brick work indicate that it was funded by the Mughal's imperial coffers. History The entry way to the main prayer hall is from the central courtyard. Persian inscriptions at the mosque indicated that it was built between 1644 and 1647, during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. An eastern addition was completed in 1659, during the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb. The mosque's mihrab had initially been incorrectly aligned with Mecca. The Sufi mystic, Makhdum Nooh, who is buried in the nearby city of Hala is said to have been approached by the mosque's planners in order to correct its alignment. Popular tradition maintains that Makhdum Nooh then corrected the error overnight by the power of his prayer, thereby ensuring his status as a saint. Historical records show that the mosque's mihrab had actually been rebuilt a century after the mosque's construction. Architecture The Shah Jahan Mosque's architectural style is overtly influenced by Turkic and Persian styles. The mosque is characterized by extensive brickwork and the use of blue tiles, both of which were directly influenced by Timurid architectural styles from Central Asia ‚àí from where the previous rulers of Sindh, the Tarkhans, had hailed before the region was annexed by the Mughals in 1592. =Decorative elements= Tile work stellate pattern to represent the night sky. The profuse use of tiles is considered to be the most elaborate display of tile work in the Indian Subcontinent. Unlike the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore, another Shah Jahan era mosque, the mosque in Thatta does not employ the use of fresco. The mosque's tiles represent a direct influence of the Timurid style. The mosque employs Cobalt blue, turqoise, manganese violet, and white tiles. The mosque's dome is embellished with exquisite blue and white tile-work arranged in stellated patterns to represent the heavens. Its walls feature calligraphic tile work, signed by Abdul Ghafur and Abdul Sheikh. The tiles' location and arrangement displays Persian Safavid influence, and features several colours on a single tile, unlike tile work at Lahore which featured a single colour on each tile. The use of multicolour tiles and floral patterns reflects Persian Kashani influences. Brick work The mosque showcases brickwork in geometric patterns. The mosque features extensive brickwork laid in geometric patterns, which is a decorative element unusual for Mughal era mosques, and is an element of Timurid architecture adopted for use in the mosque. The mosque's brickwork was also influenced by Sindhi vernacular styles, which in turn was influenced by Persian architecture. Brick work is most notable in the arcades surrounding the central courtyard, while concentric rings of brick are used to embellish the underside of peripheral domes. =Layout= Brickwork along corridors The layout of the mosque may have been influenced by the conservative Timurid-style Humayun Mosque in Kachhpura, near the city of Agra, in modern-day India. The main entryway into the mosque complex is through a Persian-style Charbagh, or quadrangle garden. The main prayer hall is set to the west of its central courtyard, which features iwans, or portals, in each of its four cardinal directions. The courtyard is rectangular in shape, and measures 169 feet by 97 feet. It is surrounded by aisled galleries, which are lined with 33 arches. The mosque's mihrab features pierced screens - an element that is commonly employed on Mughal funerary monuments, but unusual in Mughal mosques. The mosque features excellent acoustics; a person speaking on one end of the dome can be heard from the other end when the speech exceeds 100 decibels. Prayers in the main prayer hall can be heard throughout the entire building. The mosque is unusual for its lack of minarets. It has a total of 93 domes, the most of any structure in Pakistan. Conservation Restoration works were carried out by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1692, as well as by Murad Ali Khan Talpur in 1812.
