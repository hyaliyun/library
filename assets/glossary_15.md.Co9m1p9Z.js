The epitaph sits on the pier directly opposite to the Tomb of Ferdinand van den Eynde in the church of Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome. The epitaph was completed in 1629. Subject Vrijburgh was a young Netherlandish nobleman from Alkmaar, who, like Ferdinand van den Eynde, was part of the Flemish community of expatriates in Rome. In 1628 he dueled with another Netherlandish nobleman in Rome, and on December 19, 1628, he died from injuries he suffered in the duel. Like Van den Eynde, Vryburch died prematurely, aged twenty-three. He was buried in Santa Maria dell'Anima the next day. Vryburch was a Protestant, but his executors managed to get him buried in the church by promising that a beautiful white marble monument would be erected therein. Duquesnoy and Vryburch knew each other, as the Fiammingo had carved a portrait of him a few years before Vryburch's demise. Sculpture The administration of Santa Maria dell'Anima granted permission for the installation of the epitaph on the pier above Vryburch's grave in October 1629. Vryburch's uncle, Theodore Quinting, and the executor of his will Baldoin Breyel (an Antwerp born merchant and a leading member of the Flemish community in Rome) arranged for the commission of Vryburch's epitaph. In the epitaph, two putti, casting mournful glances left and right, are raising a cloth with an inscription to Vryburch. They perch onto an animal hide hung around a coat of arms behind them. There are a ram's horns circling the coat of arms, which emerge from the holed hide and recall the theme of Isaac. The epitaph is completed by an urn at the monument's base. For this monument, Duquesnoy innovatively abandoned architectural frameworking, supplying just a cornice to support the coat of arms, and applying it onto an existing pier. The epitaph was inspired by Duquesnoy's study of Roman sarcophagi and cippi. Vryburch's putti are in fact more mature children than the typical putto. These are generally found on the cippi monuments. Be that as it may, Vryburch's putti were a further step forward in Duquesnoy's evolution of the winged infants to the \\"peak of [the putto's] evolution,\\" represented in the Van den Eynde's putti. With its putti raising a cloth to the passerby viewer, the monument figures the \\"displacement of the untimely death away from one's homeland.\\" The monument presents itself as a makeshift, roadside memorial. The employment of existing architecture further highlights this apparent marker's ephemerality.

History  Joseph Treffry (born Joseph Austen in 1782) was the owner of the Fowey Consuls mine and wanted a harbour to export copper and import coal. He started work on a harbour in the small cove of Porth in 1829. The first ships used it in 1833 and it was finished in 1840. The breakwater enclosed of harbour and was capable of taking up to about 50 vessels of 200 tons each. The port is tidal so the vessels would sit on the bottom at low tide. Cornish granite was exported from Par in the early days for such famous landmarks as Waterloo Bridge in London, Chatham Docks, Gibraltar Docks & Glasgow Docks. As the china clay industry grew in the area during the 19th century this became the main export through the docks. According to the Imerys Blueprint For Cornwall published in 2003: 1858 ‚Äì 15,154 tons of china clay went out through Par 1885 ‚Äì 86,325 tons 1987 ‚Äì 700,000 tons 2002 ‚Äì 313,425 tons + 134,810 tons of aggregates Treffry Estates sold the harbour to English China Clay (ECC) in 1964 having leased it to them since 1946. In the 1950s and 1960s, vast dryers were built on-site. The current Grade Dryer was built in 1996. In 2007 the port and some of the clay dries (those dealing with clay for the paper industry) closed with the loss of 200 jobs. All shipping for clay now goes to Fowey. The port is still the site of a Milling Centre and a Grade Dryer and this continued industrial usage means ECO-BOS's ideas for a marina and residential Eco-village on the dis-used dryer site to the west of the docks is unlikely to come to fruition. The port is used by vessels servicing the St Austell Bay Mussel Farm. = The Stack = The port was famous for its ‚ÄúStack‚Äù ‚Äì the chimney of a lead smelter that had to be demolished in 1907 after it was hit by lightning ‚Äì and for its low-roofed engines Alfred & Judy (Bagnall 0-4-0ST), the inspiration for Bill & Ben in Rev W Awdry‚Äôs children‚Äôs books about Thomas The Tank Engine after his visit to the docks in 1966. The port is still served by a rail line from St Blazey and still has the occasional early morning train.

In North America, a campfire story is a form of oral storytelling performed around an open fire at night, typically in the wilderness, largely connected with the telling of stories having supernatural motifs or elements of urban legend. Whereas the activity is not incomparable to, nor mutually exclusive from, indigenous practices they should not be confused with each other in a contemporary context.  History  The modern campfire story is an invention of the late modern period and may have arisen among soldiers or frontiersmen who utilized storytelling as a nightly means to stay awake while acting as camp lookouts. In North America, as early as the 1840s, the term \\"camp-fire story\\" was associated with wartime exploits such as those told in a military encampment. In the late 1800s, advertisements, for journals and lectures, providing the inclusion of \\"camp-fire stories\\" began to appear. Contemporaneously, fraternities and other organizations would arrange reunions among veterans who then continued the tradition in peacetime and even outside the confines of a camp. The term likewise began to be connected with encounters with large or dangerous game, such as bears, buffaloes, panthers or snakes. With the formation of youth groups, such as Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts of America, came the adoption of practices already established by organizations of the day. Consequently, campfire stories came to be an integral part within such organizations nearly since their inception. In the first edition of the official handbook for the Boy Scouts of America, chapter three on \\"Campcraft\\" provides many notes for campfire entertainment including those on storytelling. While the example story provided is an adaptation of Native American oral tradition, the criteria for stories given is as follows: \\"Indian legends, war stories, ghost stories, detective stories, stories of heroism, the history of life, a talk about the stars.\\" It is among these early youth groups that the understanding of a campfire story came to be broadened and signaled a major shift in audience from veterans to a more general public. Likewise, the very nature of such organizations present factors conducive to stories of the supernatural, namely, the introduction of younger groups of listeners far more impressionable to stories of a frightful or fantastic nature. In time, the popularity of the latter would come to be predominant and greatly eclipse other genre stories. Camping activity Campfire stories hold a strong association with camping as a form of recreation. Author William W. Forgey in the introduction to his 1984 book Campfire Stories... Things That Go Bump in the Night noted that in his ten years of service as a scout-master the most requested campfire event were stories that evoke fear. Forgey further identified a number of elements that should go into the telling of a campfire story: # Enjoy the practice # Maintain eye contact # Keep in close contact with audience # Do not obsess over details # Set a \\"quiet mood\\" prior to the story # Utilize the energy of the audience # Maintain the campfire # Forgo props or scare tactics, these distract from the story # Use different vocal inflections # Start sessions with believable tales to build credibility Forgey's points emphasize an important distinction of the campfire story as a practice rather than a genre as is the case with ghost stories or urban legends. The campfire story while owing a strong association with horror or the supernatural is not a subset nor class of tales but an outdoor activity, as much so as is hiking, rock climbing or swimming, as well for many a rite of passage into the years directly proceeding preadolescence.

She created the role of The Witch in the world premiere of Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel and appeared in numerous leading soprano roles in the opera houses of Germany. Also known as Hermine d'Albert, she was the third wife of the composer Eugen d'Albert to whom she was married from 1895 until their divorce in 1911. Finck was born in Baden-Baden and died at the age of 60 in Berlin where she had taught singing in her later years. Life and career Finck was born in Baden-Baden to a prosperous middle-class family. She began her musical education at Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium in Frankfurt and later studied singing at the Leipzig conservatory with Gustav Borchers and Auguste G√∂tze. Finck made her stage debut in the title role of Carmen at the Weimar Court Theater in 1892 and became a regular member of the company. She came to wider attention in 1893 when she sang the role of The Witch in the world premiere of Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel. Finck and the composer Eugen d'Albert met that same year through his friendship with Richard Strauss who had conducted the Hansel and Gretel premiere. They began an affair, although d'Albert was still in a tempestuous marriage with his second wife, Teresa Carre√±o. In order to be close to Finck, d'Albert took a job as Kapellmeister at the Weimar Court Theatre. Following his divorce from Carre√±o, the couple married on 21 October 1895 at the Protestant church in Gersbach. In 1897 Finck created the role of Waltrudis in the world premiere of d'Albert's three-act opera Gernot at the Mannheim Court Theater. However, after her marriage, she largely devoted herself to concert singing and touring with her husband and became known as the principal interpreter of d'Albert's vocal music. He wrote nearly 60 songs for her as well as Seejungfr√§ulein, a cantata for soprano and orchestra loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \\"The Little Mermaid\\". Her marriage to d'Albert ended in divorce in 1911, two years after the birth of their only child, Violante Giovanna d'Albert. It had been the longest and most stable of d'Albert's six marriages. After their divorce, d'Albert married three more times. Finck moved to Berlin where she resumed her stage career. She was engaged by the Berlin Court Opera from 1911 until 1912 and in the summer of 1912 appeared at the Bayreuth Festival as Gerhilde in Die Walk√ºre. During the course of her career, Finck's other major roles included Bedura in d'Albert's Der Rubin, Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Leonore in Fidelio, and the title roles of Mignon and Max von Schillings's Ingwelde. In her later years Finck continued to perform as a concert singer and taught singing in Berlin. She died there in 1932 at the age of 60. Eugen d'Albert had died earlier that year. Their daughter, Violante Bergel-d'Albert (as she was known after her marriage), became a journalist and writer and died in 1990.

Arrival in Portugal George William Robinson was born in 1815 in Wakefield in Yorkshire, England. His family business in nearby Halifax, called Robinson Brothers Cork Growers, imported and processed cork from Portugal. In the 1840s he travelled to Portugal to meet with cork suppliers and, after extensive travels through the cork-growing areas, arrived in Portalegre in the north of the Alentejo region. This was the site of a small cork-processing factory that had been set up by another Briton, Thomas Reynolds, in a Franciscan convent left empty after the dissolution of the monasteries in Portugal in 1834. Factory purchase Robinson settled in Portalegre in 1848, eventually buying the small factory, which Reynolds had to sell to meet business debts incurred by his son, also called Thomas. With a ready-made factory at his disposal and a family business in England to sell to, Robinson also benefitted from rapidly rising export prices for cork products. The United Kingdom accounted for more than 50% of Portuguese sales of products such as pressed plank cork, corks for bottles, notice boards and cork buoys. By the mid-1850s he had around 260 employees, including those who stripped the bark from the trees. Family Robinson married Sarah Anne (surname ??) from England and they set up home in Boavista, to the south of the factory. The couple had six or seven children but only two would outlive them. George Wheelhouse Robinson, who would eventually take over the business was born on 17 September 1857. He was sent to England as a young boy to avoid the illnesses from which his siblings had died. He studied in Doncaster and did not return permanently to Portugal until he was 24. He died in 1932; his sister Mary died in 1918. Business expansion In 1868 Robinson purchased at public auction part of the land of the dissolved Convent, which had until then belonged to the Portuguese Exchequer. In the same year, the three woollen textile factories in Portalegre went bankrupt and Robinson's factory became the major employer. It purchased its first steam engine in 1872. A few years later Robinson began to purchase land for cork production in nearby Spain. In 1880 he was to inform the Portuguese Parliament that his factory employed 680 workers, of whom 420 were women. Religious activities Robinson was an Evangelical Protestant and in 1880 he set up a church in Portalegre, buying a house with a theatre attached for that purpose. This gained a significant following in the town. He pursued altruistic activities and, in 1881, was described by the Portuguese Government's Industrial Survey of 1881 as ‚Äúenergetic, intelligent, from year to year he has increased the factory in size, and, through training and discipline within the framework of strict adherence to regulations governing his work force, he has raised his business to such a level of prosperity that it has become not only the main such business in the Province but has made of its proprietor one of the wealthiest owners of rural buildings in the area.‚Äù Death George William Robinson died on 30 April 1895. In his will he specified that ‚Äúthe workers of the cork factory shall take three days of mourning and each one shall be paid six days‚Äô wages besides the three days‚Äô mourning, during which they will not go to the factory‚Äù. In 1881 Robinson had handed over management of his business to his son, who continued to diversify the family's wealth through the purchase and rental of additional land in Portugal and Spain, as well as a cork factory in San Vicente de Alc√°ntara in Spain. The Portalegre factory suffered a damaging fire in 1898, leading the company to establish a volunteer fire service for the town. The factory purchased three Babcock & Wilcox steam boilers in the early 1900s. The business became a limited company in 1931 but remained in the hands of the family until 1946, when it passed into Portuguese ownership. The factory closed in 2009 and is now the site of a museum and of the Robinson Foundation (Fundac√£o Robinson), which was set up in 2005 and aims to preserve a record of the cork industry.

As member of the Southern Cross expedition 1898‚Äì1900, Savio together with Ole Must were the first to overnight on the Antarctic continent. He was also part of the sled team who were the first persons to travel on the Ross Ice Shelf and reaching a new Farthest South record.  Southern Cross expedition  The Southern Cross expedition was the first British discovery voyage in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration and a forerunner of the more famous expeditions of Robert Falcon Scott, Ernest Shackleton, and Roald Amundsen. It was the Norwegian-born, half- English explorer and schoolmaster Carsten Borchgrevink who had the idea for and led the expedition. Ten expedition members were to spend the night at Cape Adare on the Ross Sea, and Borchgrevink had selected the two Sami‚ÄîPer Savio and Ole Must‚Äîas dog sledders. The plan was to use the dogs on sleigh rides across the continent. The expedition arrived at Cape Adare, where Borchgrevink had been ashore during the expedition of 1894‚Äì1895, on 17 February 1899. The 75 dogs were sent ashore first with their Sami caretakers, and the two thus became the first to spend a night on the Antarctic continent. At Cape Adare, an extensive scientific program was carried out, but the opportunities for further exploration of the hinterland were severely limited by the mountainous terrain with many glaciers surrounding the camp. They then explored the Ross Sea along the same route that James Clark Ross had followed 60 years earlier. After reaching the Great Ice Barrier, a group of three consisting of Borchgrevink, Savio and William Colbeck became the first to make a sleigh ride on the barrier surface. They reached 78¬∞ 50‚Ä≤S, the southernmost point until then reached by humans, earning Amundsen's approbation: \\"We must acknowledge that, by ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink opened the way to the south, and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed\\".Amundsen, Vol I, pp. 25‚Äì26 Borchgrevink later described Savio as \\"recognized for his loyal nature, boldness and intelligence.\\"  Later life  Savio returned to Norway in 1900, and received a hero's welcome. He married Else Josefsdatter Strimp, daughter of the Sami merchant Josef Strimp in Strimpg√•rden in Bug√∏yfjord. They had three children together, of whom only their son John Savio (1902‚Äì1938) reached adulthood. John Savio is one of the most famous Sami artists.

(Greek: Œë.Œ†.Œü. ŒßŒ±œÅŒ±œÖŒ≥ŒÆ), also known simply as Haravgi was a Greek football club, based in Larissa. The colours of the team were green and yellow. History The club was founded in 1982 as Haravgi A.E. (Greek: Œë.E. ŒßŒ±œÅŒ±œÖŒ≥Œ∑), in the Haravgi (former Kali Kardia) district of Larissa town (Greek: ŒõŒ¨œÅŒπœÉŒ±) located in the Thessaly region of Greece. The club started from the lower divisions of the Larissa FCA, and in 1994 with chairman Stavros Pappas at the helm it eventually gained promotion to the top amateur division which was equivalent to the 5th overall division in the Greek football league system. Haravgi stayed there for 2 seasons only to be relegated in 1996. For the next four seasons the team made several attempts to win promotion but they ended in failure. Financial troubles led to the dissolution of the club in 2000. The most famous manager of the club was former goalkeeper Theologis Papadopoulos who had even been a member of the Greek national team, while the last chairman of the club was Kostas Voutiritsas, a former Haravgi player and brother of Theodoros Voutiritsas, another former Greek national team footballer. The club used the Anthoupoli Ground, which is part of the Anthoupoli Athletic Center complex, located in the Anthoupoli district in Larissa for its home games and it developed an intense rivalry with Anthoupoli Larissa, another local team who Haravgi shared the ground with. Haravgi players in Greek first division Haravgi came into the spotlight in the mid 90s when two of its squads members were transferred to Alpha Ethniki teams, the highest division in the Greek football league system: Dimitris Pappas and Konstantinos Mangos. These two footballers are the most important players who came out of the youth ranks of the club. Striker Dimitris Pappas who is currently the coach and board member of the successor club Haravgi A.E.S. took a massive step in his career by getting transferred to AEL in the summer of 1995 under new manager Giannis Mantzourakis. The same year midfielder Kostas Mangos caught the eye of OFI's Dutch manager Eug√®ne Gerards and was subsequently signed by the club from Heraklion. Maggos would later on return to his hometown to play for AEL in the Greek Beta Ethniki, after even being part of an OFI squad that played in the 1997-98 UEFA Cup against teams like Ferencv√°ros and Auxerre. Panagiotis Migas is also another former Haravgi footballer who became a member of AEL in 1998, without nevertheless featuring in any official game. Youngest player ever to score a hat-trick Haravgi Larissa F.C. produced one of the youngest ever footballers to score a hat-trick in a debut game. Just 14 year old striker Ntinos Pontikas scored all three goals of his team in an 4-3 away defeat by Ampelokipoi Larissa in 1996. In that game, future Greece international defender Vangelis Moras was on the bench being a squad member of AO Ampelokipoi, the club he started his career from. Despite the fact that Pontikas was considered a great prospect during his youth career he would surprisingly quit football a few years later, several months after his transfer to another local team Ikaros Neapolis fell through. His feat still remains a record in greek football. =Notable players= * Konstantinos Mangos * Dimitris Pappas * Panagiotis Migas * Ntinos Pontikas =Notable managers= * Theologis Papadopoulos =Notable chairmen= * Stavros Pappas * Giorgos Pappas * Kostas Voutiritsas Modern era: Haravgi A.E.S. A new sports club was formed in the early 2000s under the name of Haravgi Larissa A.E.S, (Greek: ŒëŒ∏ŒªŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒïŒ∫œÄŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ Œ£œçŒªŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ ŒßŒ±œÅŒ±œÖŒ≥ŒÆ) using orange and grey as its colours. For many it is considered the continuation of the old club. The new club started playing in the Thessaliko ground instead of the traditional Anthoupoli ground which Haravgi Larissa used to share with their arch rivals Anthoupoli Larissa. It later created a basketball and a handball department. Both Dimitris Pappas and Konstantinos Mangos have also played for the successor club Haravgi A.E.S. in the later stages of their career. . Dimitris Pappas is the current coach of team that competes in the Larissa FCA B Division for the 2020-21 season.

Shakerly was born in Halifax, Yorkshire to William Shakerley and Judith Brig (Briggs/Brigge). He was educated at a free school and then studied in Ireland before returning due to the unrest there. He concentrated on studies in mathematics from 1647 and began to correspond with the astrologer William Lilly. He believed that astrology could be improved by astronomical practice and sought to predict eclipses. He worked under John Stephenson and made calculations based on Kepler's tables. For a while he lived under the patronage of Christopher Towneley at Carre Hall. In 1649 he began to critique the work of Vincent Wing which he published as The anatomy of Urania practica: ‚Ä¶ laying open the errors and impertinencies delivered ‚Ä¶ by Mr Vincent Wing, and Mr William Leybourne, under the title of Urania practica (1649). He had examined the work of Jeremy Horrocks and found better explanation of the dynamics of the moon. Shakerley's predictions were published by Robert and William Leybourne as Tabulae Britannicae: the British Tables (1653). He travelled to India to make observations on a transit of Mercury predicted to occur in 1651. While in India, he calculated the latitude of Surat as \\"21 degrees and betwixt 10' and 15' North\\" writing to Henry Osborne in London. He observed that Indian astrologers were able to make predictions of lunar eclipses with little error and sought to examine the methods used. Nothing further was heard of him and it is thought that he died in India.

Background  Portugal was taking part in World War I, a participation that was largely unpopular due to its social and economic impacts, and that the government tried to contain using repressive measures. A conspiracy emerges within the Unionists, initially supported by its leader Manuel de Brito Camacho, but who later had a change of heart and did not participate in the coup. Sid√≥nio Pais leads the coup, with the support of every political force except for the Uni√£o Sagrada (a coalition between the Democratic Party and the Evolutionist Party).  Coup  On the night of 5 December 1917, Sid√≥nio Pais, with the support of multiple units of the Army, occupied the Eduardo VII Park and the main roads of access. The total rebel army forces were around 2.500 in number. Jos√© Norton de Matos, then war minister, takes command of the government forces, as both Afonso Costa (head of government) and Augusto Soares (foreign affairs minister) are out of the country. Norton commanded the forces from the Navy Arsenal and had the support of the Navy, National Republican Guard, the Fiscal Guard, the police, and some Army units. On 6 December 1917, multiple houses and businesses are sacked as the police does not leave its quarters. The Navy, positioned in the Tagus river and led by Leote de Rego aboard the NRP Guadiana, exchange fire with the rebel forces in Eduardo VII. On 7 December 1917, the government forces decide to take over the forces on Eduardo VII. A column of Navy and GNR members attempt a frontal attack from the Avenida. Another column attempts to attack from Rato, supported by artillery placed in the S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara garden (in Bairro Alto). These attacks are slow and unsuccessful. On 8 December 1917, the government hands president Bernardino Machado its resignation.  Aftermath  The facilities and houses of Democratic leaders are sacked. A Military Junta, led by Sid√≥nio Pais, was then established. The Junta officially deposed the president, government and parliament. Afonso Costa and Augusto Soares were imprisoned as they returned to the country, Norton de Matos and Leote de Rego escaped in an English steamboat, and president Bernardino Machado was exiled by the Military Junta. The Military Junta only ruled for a few days, giving way, on 11 December 1917, to a government led by Sid√≥nio Pais. Sid√≥nio was later elected, in a general election, as president, after the regime was altered from a semi-presidential system to a full-presidential system. The casualties of the coup are registered as 109 dead and 500 wounded.

The bridge used to connect Manzanola town of Otero County with Crowley County in Colorado.  History  The first Manzanola Bridge was built in 1908, near Clifton in Mesa County over the Colorado River. It was replaced by a new design in 1950 and moved to a new location over the Arkansas River connecting Manzanola, Colorado with Crowley County, Colorado. At the new location, the new bridge replaced a \\"three-span pinned truss\\" which was built in 1908. With On June 24, 1985, the bridge was added in to National Register of Historic Places. And, in 1994, the bridge was demolished and a much more modern structure was cosntructed to handle the traffic of Colorado State Highway 207. The 1950s structure was used to be considered as one of the earliest \\"rigid- connected vehicular trusses\\" in Colorado and one of seven \\"riveted Pennsylvania through trusses\\". At the time of its existence, it was recorded as the \\"longest span roadway truss\\" in the state.

He made his first profession on 21 October 1934, and he studied philosophy and theology at the St Thomas Aquinas College in Rabat before being ordained a priest on 11 June 1939. During World War II, he was at the Dominican convent in Birgu when it was partially destroyed in January 1941 by aerial bombardment aimed at the British aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious which was in the nearby harbour. Fsadni and the other Dominican friars subsequently moved to the Rabat convent and to a house in Birkirkara before returning to Birgu and staying within the Inquisitor's Palace. After the war, Fsadni was assigned to the Santa Marija tal-Gƒßar convent in Rabat, where he remained for the rest of his life. Fsadni was also a historian and writer, and he was particularly interested in the history of the Dominicans in Malta. He published several monographs about the Dominicans, and he also wrote about Maltese vernacular stone huts known as giren. He was also interested in photography. In 1966, while doing some research about Dominican friars at the Notarial Archives, he and Godfrey Wettinger (who was researching about slavery) discovered a 15th-century poem known as Il-Kantilena, which turned out to be the oldest known surviving text in Maltese. Fsadni and Wettinger subsequently collaborated on studying the text, its author Pietru Caxaro and its copyist Brandano Caxaro. In 1975, Fsadni was awarded the Rothmans Prize for Literature, and in 1990 his publication on giren won him a gold medal at the government's literary prizes. He also won a photography competition in 1988. He was awarded ƒ†ieƒß il-Birgu on 7 September 2000, and on 13 December 2008 he received the title of Member of the National Order of Merit. He died on 18 April 2013, three days after his 97th birthday, at the Villa Messina care home in Rabat. At the time of his death, he was the oldest member of the Dominican Order in Malta.

It is a mountain with parasitic vents that consists of two coalesced volcanoes; Berlin proper with the wide Berlin Crater and Merrem Peak with a wide crater, away from Berlin. Trachyte is the dominant volcanic rock and occurs in the form of lava flows and pyroclastic rocks. It has a volume of and rises from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is part of the Marie Byrd Land Volcanic Province. The volcano began erupting during the Pliocene and was active into the late Pleistocene-Holocene. Several tephra layers encountered in ice cores all over Antarctica - but in particular at Mount Moulton - have been linked to Mount Berlin, which is the most important source of such tephras in the region. The tephra layers were formed by explosive eruptions/Plinian eruptions that generated high eruption columns. Presently, fumarolic activity occurs at Mount Berlin and forms ice towers from freezing steam.  Geography and geomorphology  Mount Berlin lies in Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica, inland from the Hobbs Coast of the Amundsen Sea. The volcano was studied during field trips in December 1940, November 1967, November- December 1977 and 19941995. The volcano is named after Leonard M. Berlin, who led the 1940 research visit to the mountain. Mount Berlin emerges from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and rises to above sea level, making it the highest volcano in the Flood Range with slopes of about 12-13¬∞. Berlin Crater, a wide summit crater, lies at the top of Mount Berlin; the highest point of the volcano lies by its southeastern rim. Mount Berlin consists of two overlapping edifices; the other part of the volcano is Merrem Peak, west-northwest. Merrem Peak is high and has a wide crater at its summit. These craters are aligned in east-west direction like other Flood Range calderas. Mount Berlin has variously been described as a composite volcano, shield volcano or stratovolcano with a volume of about . The entire edifice has a length of about . The volcano is the western end of the Flood Range; Wells Saddle separates it from Mount Moulton volcano farther east. The volcano is covered by glaciers, and thus only a few rocky outcrops occur on the mountain although the volcano is considered to be well-exposed compared to other volcanoes in the region. Monogenetic volcanoes on the northern flank of Mount Berlin have generated two outcrops of mafic lava and scoria, one of which is found at Mefford Knoll on a linear vent. On the southeastern flank, a fiamme-rich ignimbrite crops out and is correlated to a flank vent on the northeastern flank. A ridge emanates northwestward from Merrem Peak, with Brandenberger Bluff at its foot. Brandenberger Bluff is a high outcrop of lava and tuff that formed phreatomagmatically; it was formerly interpreted as a subglacial hyaloclastite. Other topographical locations on Mount Berlin are Fields Peak on the northern flank, Kraut Rocks at the west-southwestern foot, Walts Cliff on the northeastern flank and Wedemeyer Rocks at the southern foot. Nonvolcanic features include incipient cirques on the northern and western side. File:MountBerlinMap.jpgTopographical map of Mount Berlin File:MountBerlin.jpgAerial view of Mount Berlin  Geology  The Marie Byrd Land volcanic province features 18 central volcanoes and accompanying parasitic vents, which form islands off the coast or nunataks in the ice. Many of these volcanoes form distinct volcanic chains, such as the Executive Committee Range where volcanic activity has shifted at a rate of about . Such a movement is also apparent in the Flood Range, where activity migrated from Mount Moulton to Mount Berlin. This movement appears to reflect the propagation of crustal fractures, as plate motion is extremely slow in the region. Volcanic activity appears to take place in three phases, an early mafic phase, often followed by a second felsic phase. End-stage volcanism occurs in the form of small cone-forming eruptions. Ignimbrites are rare in Marie Byrd Land; the outcrop on the southeastern flank of Mount Berlin is a rare exception. Activity began during the middle Miocene and continued into the later Quaternary, with argon-argon dating yielding ages as young as 8,200 years. Four volcanoes in the Marie Byrd Land volcanic province - Mount Berlin, Mount Siple, Mount Takahe and Mount Waesche - were classified as \\"possibly or potentially active\\" by LeMasurier 1990, and active subglacial volcanoes have been identified on the basis of aerophysical surveys. The volcanic province is related to the West Antarctic Rift which is variously interpreted as a rift or as a plate boundary. The rift has been volcanically and tectonically active over the past 30-25 million years. The basement crops out near the coast and consists of Paleozoic rocks with intruded Cretaceous and Devonian granites which were flattened by erosion, leaving a Cretaceous erosion surface on which volcanoes rest. The volcanic activity at Mount Berlin may ultimately relate to the presence of a mantle plume that is impinging onto the crust in Marie Byrd Land. = Local deposits = Pyroclastic fallout deposits crop out in the crater rim, reaching thicknesses of . Merrem Peak crater also has outcrops of fallout deposits. The Mount Berlin deposits reach thicknesses of over close to the crater, diminishing to at Merrem Peak. They were formed by pyroclastic fallout during eruptions, which mantled the topography and generated diverse fallout deposits when eruption characteristics changed. Tuff deposits containing lapilli and volcanic ash-rich pyroclastic deposits in the crater rim were erupted during hydromagmatic events. Some lava flows feature levees. Some fall deposits in the crater rim were confused with lava flows in the past. Hyalotuff, obsidian and pumice have been recovered from Mount Berlin. Both welded and unwelded, pyroclastic and tuffaceous breccias are present. They consist of lava bombs, lithic rocks, obsidian fragments and pumice. Hyaloclastite occurs around the base of Mount Berlin. = Composition = Most volcanic rocks of Mount Berlin define a trachyte suite, which features both comendite and pantellerite. Phonolite is less common. Mafic rocks have been reported from flank vents, basanite and hawaiite from Mefford Knoll, benmoreite from the southeastern flank at Wedemeyer Rocks, phonotephrite from Brandenberger Bluff and mugearite without any particular locality. Phenocrysts make up only a small portion of the volume and consist mostly of alkali feldspar, with subordinate apatite, fayalite, hedenbergite and opaque minerals. Benmoreite has more phenocrysts, which include anorthoclase, magnetite, olivine, plagioclase, pyroxene and titanaugite. Groundmass include basanite, mafic rocks, trachyte and trachy-phonolite. Xenoliths are also recorded. The magma erupted by Mount Berlin appears to originate in the form of discrete small batches rather than in one large magma chamber. The composition of volcanic rocks varied between eruptions and probably also during different phases of the same eruption. Phonolite was erupted early during volcanic evolution and followed by trachyte during the Quaternary. A long term trend in iron and sulfur of the tephras may indicate a long term trend towards more primitive magma compositions.  Eruption history  Mount Berlin was active from the Pliocene into the Holocene. The oldest parts are found at Wedemeyer Rocks and Brandenberger Bluff and are 2.7 million years old. Activity then took place at Merrem Peak between 571,000 and 141,000 years ago; during this phase eruptions also occurred on the flanks of Mount Berlin. After 25,500 years ago it shifted to Mount Berlin proper and the volcano grew by more than . Over time, volcanic activity on Mount Berlin has moved in south-southeast direction. Eruptions of Berlin include both effusive eruptions, that emplaced cinder cones and lava flows, and Plinian eruptions/ intense explosive eruptions, which generated eruption columns up to high. Such intense eruptions would have injected tephra into the stratosphere and deposited it across the southern Pacific Ocean and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. During the last 100,000 years Mount Berlin has been more active than Mount Takahe, the other major source of tephra in the West Antarctic. Mount Berlin underwent a surge in activity between 35,000/40,000 - 18,000/20,000 years ago. Despite their size, the eruptions at Mount Berlin did not significantly impact climate. The eruption history of Mount Berlin is recorded in outcrops on Mount Berlin, in a blue-ice area on Mount Moulton, away, at Mount Waesche, in ice cores and in the Southern Ocean. A number of tephra layers found in ice cores all across Antarctica have been attributed to West Antarctic volcanoes and in particular to Mount Berlin. Tephras deposited by this volcano have been used to date ice cores, establishing that ice at Mount Moulton is at least 492,000 years old and thus the oldest ice of West Antarctica. So-called \\"megadust\\" layers in ice cores have also been linked to Mount Berlin and other volcanoes in Antarctica. = Chronology = Among eruptions recorded at Mount Berlin are: * 492,400¬±9,700 years ago, recorded at Mount Moulton. It may correspond to a 443,000¬±52,000 lava at Merrem Peak. * Cinder cones at Mefford Knoll have been dated to be 211,000¬±18,000 years old. Potassium-argon dating there and at Kraut Rocks has produced ages of 630,000¬±30,000 and 620,000¬±50,000 years, respectively. * 141,600¬±7,500 years ago, recorded at Mount Moulton. It may correspond to a 141,400¬±5,400 deposit at Merrem Peak. A 141,700 years old tephra layer at Vostok has been related to this Mount Moulton tephra. * 118,700¬±2,500 years ago, recorded at Mount Moulton and potentially also at Talos Dome. Correlated deposits at Siple Ice Dome indicate that this eruption was intense and deposited tephra over large areas. * 106,300¬±2,400 years ago, recorded at Mount Moulton. * 92,500¬±2,000 and 92,200¬±900 years ago, as dated by argon-argon dating of its deposits around Mount Berlin. A tephra layer in Dome C and Dome Fuji ice cores recovered during European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica and dated to be 89,000-87,000 years old has been attributed to this eruption on the basis of its composition. The nature of the trachytic tephra layer indicates that it was produced during an intense, multiphase eruption which may have led to compositional differences between deposits emplaced close and these emplaced far from the volcano. Deposits from this eruption have also been found in the Amundsen Sea, the Bellingshausen Sea, at a Vostok ice core and in marine sediments of the continental margin of West Antarctica (\\"tephra A\\"). * 27,300¬±2,300 years ago, recorded at Mount Moulton. * Ages of 25,500¬±2,000 years ago have been obtained from two lower welded pyroclastic units that crop out within Mount Berlin crater. * Unwelded obsidian fallout units that crop out in Mount Berlin crater have been dated to be 18,200¬±5,800 years old. * 14,500¬±3,800 years ago, recorded at Mount Moulton. * Tephra layers found both close to and away from Mount Berlin and a lava flow appear to have been produced during an extended eruption about 10,500¬±2,500 years ago. * 7,768 BCE with an interval of 15 years, as dated in the Siple Dome A ice core. A lava flow on Mount Berlin and tephras at Mount Moulton have a similar composition even if no exact match is found. A number of tephra layers between 18,100 and 55,400 years old, found in Siple Dome ice cores, resemble these of Mount Berlin, as do tephras emplaced 9,346 and 2,067 BCE (interval 3.0 years) in the Siple Dome A ice core. The marine \\"Tephra B\\" and \\"Tephra C\\" layers may also come from Mount Berlin but statistical methods have not supported such a relationship. A 694¬±7 before present tephra layer found in the TALDICE ice core in East Antarctica may come from Mount Berlin or from Mount Melbourne and may have been erupted at the same time as an eruption of The Pleiades.  Last eruption and present-day activity  The date of the last eruption of Mount Berlin is unclear but the Global Volcanism Program gives 8,350¬±5,300 years as the date of the last eruption. The volcano is considered active and several volcano-tectonic earthquakes have been recorded on Mount Berlin. Mount Berlin is geothermally active, the only volcano in Marie Byrd Land with such activity. Steaming ice towers are found at Mount Berlin on the western and northern rim of Berlin Crater. Their existence was first reported in 1968; ice towers form when fumarole exhalations freeze in the cold Antarctic atmosphere and are a characteristic trait of Antarctic volcanoes. ASTER satellite imaging has not detected these fumaroles presumably because they are hidden within the ice towers. An over long ice cave begins at one of these ice towers; temperatures of over have been recorded on the cave floor. These geothermal environments may host geothermal habitats similar to these in Victoria Land and at Deception Island, but Mount Berlin is remote and has never been studied in this sense. It has been prospected for the potential to obtain geothermal power.

Her work often looks like an oil, because she worked with thickness of paint, strength of paint, and strength of contrasting colors. ...[H]er work is not wishy-washy like many watercolors are. There's always a power there, strength. She was impatient with [oils]. It has advantages, but it's a clumsy medium, and when you work with oils, you have to know which ones dry quickly, and which ones dry slowly. ...[S]he liked the quickness, the immediacy of watercolor that oil does not have.\\" Awards :*1942, Daniel Schnakenberg Scholarship from the Art Students League of New York :*1945, First Prize for works in watercolor by the National Arts Club, for her painting Land :*May 17, 1958, H.T.

Early years Thomas James Comber was born on 7 November 1852 in Claredon Street, Camberwell, London. His father was a manufacturing jeweler. Both parents were members of the Denmark Place Baptist Chapel. He was the second of five children, one of whom died in infancy. He was trained at Regent's Park College, London. Missionary career =Cameroons= The Baptist Missionary Society (BMS) accepted Comber for service in the Cameroons. He served there with George Grenfell from 1876 to 1878. In 1878 Comber and Grenville made two exploratory trips to the Congo River to check the viability of a mission there. Grenfell resigned from the BMS, but Comber was able to get support for a mission to the Congo when he returned to Britain. On 4 April 1879 he married Minnie Rickards, daughter of his Sunday school teacher. =Early days in the Congo= Kingdom of Kongo The first group of Baptist missionaries sailed from Liverpool for the Congo later in April 1879, and reached Banana on 9 June 1879 after a voyage of six weeks and two days. From there they went up to Msuka in the Zaire, and then divided into two parties and went by land to S√£o Salvador, capital of the Kingdom of Kongo. Soon after their arrival, on 24 August Comber's wife, who was recovering from a serious bout of fever, died of meningitis. At first the missionaries lived in straw huts, but by the next spring they had completed a stone house. Comber and H. E. Crudgington left on 2 January 1880 hoping to reach Stanley Pool. They received a friendly reception almost everywhere, particularly in Mwala, where they stayed for a week. However, none of their attempts for 18 months managed to reach the Pool. During one of these trips Crudgington received an iron projectile in his back that penetrated to a depth of , and had to return to San Salvador to have it removed. =Later events= In 1884 Minnie Comber's sister, who was a missionary in the Cameroons, died. In 1885 his brother, also a missionary in the Congo, also died. Camber's Congolese servant William Mantu Parkinson was baptized in 1886 in S√£o Salvador, the first convert. In June 1887 Comber contracted a remittent fever complicated with hematuria, and was told by the doctor that a sea voyage was the only hope for saving his life. Lieutenant Louis Valcke, President of the Executive Board of the Congo Free State, let the mission take the Prince Bodouin from Underhill to Banana, and there they carried Comber onto the homeward bound German steamer Lulu Bohlen. The sea breezes only had a temporary beneficial effect, and on 27 June 1887 Comber died while the vessel was anchored off Loango.

The border is 817 km (508 m) in length and runs from the tripoint with Laos in the north-east to the Gulf of Thailand in the south. Description The border starts in the north- east at the tripoint with Thailand at Preah Chambot peak in the D√¢ngr√™k Mountains and the follows the crest of the mountains westwards. Upon leaving the mountains the border turns south-westwards in a broad arc, occasionally utilising rivers such as the Svay Chek, the Sisophon, the Phrom Hot and Mongkol Borei. It then proceeds south, partly along the Cardamom Mountains, terminating at the Gulf of Thailand coast. This latter section runs very close to the Gulf, producing a long, thin strip of Thai territory. History The disputed Preah Vihear temple The boundary area has historically switched back and forth between various Khmer and Thai empires. From the 1860s France began establishing a presence in the region, initially in modern Cambodia and Vietnam, and later Laos, with the colony of French Indochina being created in 1887. In 1867 a Franco-Thai treaty confirmed Thai ownership of the Battambang and Angkor (Nakhou Siemrap) regions. In 1896 Britain (based in Burma) and France agreed to leave Siam (the then name for Thailand) as a buffer state between their respective colonies. However France continued to expand at the expense of Siam, annexing northern Cambodia in 1904 and then Battambang, Sisophon and Siam Nakhon/Siem Reap in 1907, whilst ceding Trat to Siam. The modern Cambodian-Thai border was as such delimited through several treaties between France and Siam between 1867 and 1907. Following Japan's invasion of French Indochina in 1940 the areas ceded to France in 1904 and 1907 were returned to Thailand, however this was reversed following Japan‚Äôs defeat and the pre-war border restored in 1946. Cambodia gained independence in 1953, and the two state since then have had a fractious relationship. A dispute arose in the late 1950s over the ownership of the Preah Vihear Temple, which lies adjacent to the border in the D√¢ngr√™k Mountains. In 1962 the case was referred to the International Court of Justice, which ruled in favour of Cambodia, however Thailand expressed reservations as to the outcome.Case Concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand), Merits , [1962] I.C.J. Reports 6, p. 23 The mid-1960s also saw a dispute over ownership of Ko Kut island. These disputes faded as Cambodia became engulfed in a series of conflicts in the following decades and the disastrous rule of the Khmer Rouge, with thousands of refugees crossing the border. Sporadic fighting broke out along the border following Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in 1979, continuing throughout the 1980s until Vietnam withdrew from the country in 1989.Puangthong Rungswasdisab, Thailand's Response to the Cambodian Genocide In an effort to stop Khmer Rouge infiltration from Thailand, Cambodia built a large fortified fence along the border in the second half of the 1980s.Margaret Slocomb, \\"The K5 Gamble: National Defence and Nation Building under the People's Republic of Kampuchea\\", Journal of Southeast Asian Studies (2001), 32 : 195-210 Cambridge University PressNewScientist - \\"The killing minefields of Cambodia\\" Since the advent of peace in Cambodia in the early 1990s relations with Thailand have once again soured over the Preah Vihear issue, as well as, to a lesser extent, Ko Kut island. A border commission was set up in 1995 in an attempt to settle the issues peacefully, however it has made little progress and a full border demarcation satisfactory to both sides remain outstanding.

Most cruise ship companies operating in European exclusive economic zones (EEZs) are part of two megacorporations: Carnival Corporation & plc and the Royal Caribbean Group. In 2017, Carnival's cruise ships alone caused ten times more air pollution than all of Europe's cars (over 260 million) combined, as the ship fuel emits about 2,000 times more sulphur oxides (SOx) than normal diesel fuel. All cruise ships together also accounted for 15% of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) particles emitted by all of Europe's passenger vehicles, and released large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), phosphorus (P4), soot, heavy metals and other particulates into the atmosphere as well.  Background  Modern cruise ships evolved from ocean liners, which were the most common mode of transportation between Europe and the Americas until the rise of commercial aviation in the 1950s. Airliners drastically cut trans-Atlantic travel times and formed unbeatable competition for ocean liners in terms of speed. To survive, the sector began to transform its ocean liners into cruise ships in the mid-1960s by attracting passengers by focusing the voyage on recreation and sightseeing, and less on getting travellers from A to B. Cruise lines such as Norwegian (1966), Royal Caribbean International (1968) and Carnival Cruise Line (1972) were founded in rapid succession, and over the course of years managed to expand by building ever larger cruise ships with more and more passengers (21 million globally in 2013), which increasingly negatively impacted the environment.  Most polluted port cities and countries  Symphony of the Seas, currently the world's largest cruise ship, was met with protests during its maiden voyage in Barcelona in 2018. According to a 2019 study by Transport & Environment, the following European port cities were most polluted by cruise ships docking there (data from 2017): # Barcelona, Spain: 32.8 tonnes of SOx # Palma de Mallorca, Spain: 28 tonnes of SOx # Venice, Italy: 27.5 tonnes of SOx # Southampton (including Marchwood), United Kingdom: 27.1 tonnes of SOx # Civitavecchia (near Rome), Italy: 22.3 tonnes of SOx # Piraeus (near Athens), Greece: 21 tonnes of SOx # Funchal (on Madeira), Portugal: 18 tonnes of SOx # Livorno, Italy: 16.3 tonnes of SOx # Lisbon, Portugal: 16.1 tonnes of SOx # Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain: 15.6 tonnes of SOx The following European countries have been most exposed to air pollution by cruise ships (data from 2017): # Spain: 14,496 tonnes of SOx # Italy: 13,895 tonnes of SOx # Greece: 7,674 tonnes of SOx # France: 5,950 tonnes of SOx # Norway: 5,261 tonnes of SOx  Fuel  AIDAnova, the first LGN cruise, in Santa Cruz de Tenerife (January 2020) The most commonly used fuel type for cruise ships is so-called heavy fuel oil (also called bunker oil or marine fuel), which is relatively cheap, but highly pollutive. Although diesel fuel (also known as gas oil) can work as a low-sulpher alternative, this tends to be 33‚Äì35% more expensive on average. According to Deutsche Welle, 'an average- sized cruise ship carrying 2,000 passengers uses 1,500 tonnes a day when it's at sea; in port, it requires an average of 50 tonnes to meet the liner's electricity demands.' TRT World stated that ships like the Harmony of the Seas burn 'up to 4,900 litres of fuel per hour, 249,000 litres of fuel per day'. Clean Air Southampton claimed that giant vessels such as Navigator of the Seas require as much power as a town of 50,000 inhabitants when docked. A 2018 study carried out by Naturschutzbund Deutschland (Nature Protection League Germany, NABU) reviewed the emissions of 77 cruise ships (almost the entire fleet in European waters), concluding that only one of them, AIDAnova, was not powered by highly polluting heavy fuel, but relatively 'clean' liquefied natural gas (LGN), which reduces NOx and particulate emissions by about 80%. However, even though shifting all cruise ships to LGN would be very beneficial to human health, LGN also contains methane, which is a very potent greenhouse gas and would increase global warming significantly.  Waste streams  Aside from air pollution, cruise ships produce various waste streams, namely wastewater from sinks, showers, and galleys (grey water), hazardous wastes, solid waste, oily bilge water, and ballast water.  Risks  = Human health = Sulphur oxide (SOx) emissions form sulphate (SO4) aerosols that contribute to health risks in humans. SOx, fine particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) cause premature death by various means such as lung cancer, throat cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases, and morbidity such as childhood asthma. Transport & Environment estimated that about 50,000 people a year in Europe die prematurely because of pollution from the shipping sector as a whole. This primarily affects people who live in harbour cities. In some cruise ports such as Southampton, children may be exposed to the polluted air when school's playgrounds are located near the docks. In Marseille, residents have been diagnosed with respiratory-related cancers at abnormally high rates after the cruise industry boomed. Aside from the locals, measuring has shown that passengers themselves are also exposed to heightened concentrations of nitrogen oxides during their voyage. For example, Canadian environmental researchers, which had secretly conducted air quality tests at various times and places aboard four Carnival Corporation cruises, reported in 2019 that they 'found that levels of ultra-fine particulate matter at the back of the ship behind the smokestacks while the ship was moving that were comparable to some of the world's most like Beijing and Santiago.' Carnival dismissed the claims as 'completely ridiculous', asserting its ships 'meet or exceed every requirement'. A University of British Columbia scientist also questioned some of the report's more drastic claims, but agreed with the group's general conclusions about cruise shipping from an air pollution and climate change perspective. = Environment = The emissions contribute to ocean acidification and soil acidification. Nitrogen oxides also stimulate particle and ozone formation. = Damage to buildings = Cruise ships damage building foundations of historical Venice, a World Heritage Site. In addition to causing the third-worst air pollution in any port city in Europe, cruise ships passing through the Giudecca Canal damage building foundations of historical Venice, a World Heritage Site, as well as blocking the view of inhabitants and other tourists. A week after the 12 January 2012 Costa Concordia disaster, UNESCO urged Venetian authorites to restrict the future access of cruise ships to Venice and other Italian ports with vulnerable cultural historic architecture. That year, over 600 passenger ships docked in Venice, about 300 of which were categorised as megacruises (featuring thousands of passengers and ten decks), together carrying between 1.6 to 2 million passengers. In subsequent years, the city of Venice, for whom tourism is of critical importance, tried to reach a compromise with cruise lines, but in August 2014 the Italian government interfered by prohibiting ships surpassing the weight of 96,000 tonnes from getting near the historic centre in 2015. Plans to divert a third of the cruises were announced by Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli in August 2019, after MSC Opera crashed into a smaller river cruise ship and a quay in Venice on 2 June 2019, injuring five people; however, Toninelli's plans were criticised as unrealistic by activists and other politicians.  Regulations  = International treaties = The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is the United Nations' agency for the regulation of international shipping, founded in 1948. The IMO's International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, better known as MARPOL 73/78 (effective since 1983, and later expanded), set the most important international standard in containing the environmental pollution of shipping. Amongst other things, it prohibited any kind of dumping within three nautical miles of a coastline, and set limits on sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions from ships. In international law, the maximum sulphur oxide concentration in cruise ship emissions at full sea is 0.5% from 1 January 2020 onwards. This standard (sometimes called \\"IMO 2020\\") was recommended by a United Nations subcommittee in 2008, and adopted by the IMO in 2016. Previously, the maximum concentration at full sea was set at 3.5%. Since the most commonly used heavy fuel oil was still deemed to have an average sulphur content of around 2.7% as of July 2019, this was a major shift in oil market history, and ship companies found in violation of the new regulation could face huge penalties when caught by authorities. The Ballast Water Management Convention, aimed at preventing problems such as the dispersal of invasive species, entered into force on 8 September 2017, and will fully apply on 8 September 2024. However, shipping falls outside many international agreements such as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and the 2015 Paris Agreement, and ships are also excluded from many national regulations because they move between countries, often through international waters. These aspects make it legally difficult to assign responsibility to a particular government authority, and practically difficult to check how much (cruise) ships emit and to enforce sanctions in case of violations. = Emission Control Areas = Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) mandate the most stringent marine sulphur fuel emission standard, but even in these areas cruise ship air pollution can remain a major issue. Moreover, as of 2017 there were only two SECAs in Europe, namely in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, not in the rest of Europe's waters. The best marine sulphur standard (0.1% or 1000 parts per million) remains 100 times worse than Europe's sulphur standard for road diesel/petrol (0.001% or 10 parts per million) in place during 2004‚Äì2019. Protesters in the Port of Antwerp, whose 2019 anti-cruise petition was supported by 15,000 citizens, noted the paradox that the city of Antwerp has a low-emission zone for cars and other road vehicles, but highly pollutive cruise ships can just dock close to the city centre with only minor restrictions. = Docking restrictions = Cruiseferry MS GNV Cristal docking in S√®te, France (2018) While docking, berthing or mooring in populated places for several hours, cruise ships such as the Harmony of the Seas are required to use auxiliary engines that burn low sulphur fuel, or use abatement technologies, in order to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause to the detriment of local inhabitants. However, critics say these measures are not enough to ensure their health. Activists have pushed for cruises to be using electricity from the shore (known as \\"shore power\\" or \\"cold ironing\\") during docking hours, but cruise lines have resisted this alternative. Shore power is already common in the United States, Canada and some European ports (however, as of April 2019, only two European ports are able to generate enough electricity to fully cruise ships so that the engines could be turned off), and Southampton planned to become the first port in Britain to introduce it in 2020 as well. Disadvantages from shore power include the drain on mains electricity and the required financial investment in installing the necessary infrastructure. According to CLIA, 28% of cruises used shore power in April 2019. The European Commission has ordered all ports in the European Union to make shore power available by 2025, unless there is no demand or the costs are higher than the environmental benefits. = Court cases = In 2016, Princess Cruises (a British-American subsidiary of Carnival Corporation that operates in Europe and North America) was condemned by the Court of Miami to pay 40 million U.S. dollars in damages for illegally dumping oil at sea in order to cut waste disposal costs. Initially, it was sued only for dumping 4,227 gallons (16,000 litres) of oil-contaminated waste about 20 miles (35 kilometres) off the coast of England on 26 August 2013 using a \\"magic pipe\\" from the Caribbean Princess. But later, authorities discovered that Princess Cruises had been committing this illegal pollution since 2005, and four other ships were found guilty of the same crime, and that onboard sensors were manipulated to avoid detecting seawater pollution. For violation of the probation terms of 2016, Carnival and Princess were ordered to pay an additional $20 million penalty in 2019. The new violations included discharging plastic into waters in the Bahamas, falsifying records, and interfering with court supervision. In July 2018, for the first time in the French Mediterranean, the captain of a cruise ship, MS Azura, stood trial for breaking fuel emission limits in the port of Marseille. = Other solutions =  Emissions and waste reduction  Catalytic converters could be installed to reduce the emissions of ships. In shipping, these are known as scrubbers. According to Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), 60% of cruise ships already had a scrubber installed as of April 2019. This installation could be made mandatory by the EU. MSC Cruises claims that its MSC Grandiosa (built in 2016) has several filters which reduce its gas oil sulphur oxide emissions by 97%, and nitrogen oxide emissions by 80%. However, in October 2019 The Independent warned that most of the recently installed scrubbers (3,756 on ships, amongst which many cruise ships) were 'open-loop scrubbers', that enable sulphur extracted from the fumes to be transformed into a liquid that can be illegally discharged into the sea. These therefore constituted \\"cheat devices\\", intended to appear to comply with the IMO 2020 regulation, while violating it in reality. Only 65 out of the 3,756 scrubbers were closed-loop and could not be exploited for sulpher extract dumpings at sea, but only opened on land for the appropriately safe disposal there. There are also oily water separators. According to CLIA, 62% of cruises filtered its wastewater (grey water) in April 2019.  Electric engines  It's possible to have ships run on electricity alone, especially for shorter distances such as between Sweden and Denmark. Electric engines do not emit any noxious gases (provided the electricity is clean), are silent and thus eliminate the noise pollution caused by internal combustion engines, and they require much less maintenance. On the other hand, electric batteries are relatively heavy, generate less power and speed overall, and need to be charged often, so they are less suitable over longer distances. To reduce electricity consumption, some modern ships only use LED lamps.  Relocating terminals  Costa neoRomantica and Celebrity Constellation in the Amsterdam Passenger Terminal (2012) The relocation of cruise ship passenger terminals away from densely populated areas to near surrounding towns or villages has been proposed in ports such as Venice, Antwerp and Amsterdam (Piet Heinkade), in order to reduce the number of local inhabitants exposed to air pollution (as well as spreading mass tourism more evenly). However, this has been met with protests from the surrounding towns and villages, who don't want the pollution and overtourism to spread to them instead, and the port cities themselves fear losing the economic benefits of tourism when the cruises dock too far away from where visitors will want to spend their money.

Becoming-Geser, Becoming Buryat: Oral Epic and the Politics of Navigating Four Identity Crises Burnatskom had its headquarters in Chita and a branch in Irkutsk. The leaders of Burnatskom sympathised with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and envisioned a socialist state compatible with Buddhism. Burnatskom sought to reform and modernise Buddhist religious practices. The organization promoted a regional parliament, education in Buryat language and pan-Mongolism. However the organization also expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Soviet government if Buryat national institutions would remain intact. In the political strife of 1917, the Burnatskom competed with the Transbaikal Cossack Party for influence over the region. As Buryat leaders were not given prominent positions on the Socialist-Revolutionary list, Burnatskom fielded its own list in the Transbaikal constituency in the 1917 Russian Constituent Assembly election, obtaining 17,083 votes (17.39%). Burnatskom joined the Nationalities Council of the Provisional Siberian Government in Tomsk in December 1917.Schorkowitz, Dittmar.

It was constructed between 1912 and 1946 on the site of an earlier church which had existed since around 1400. The building has a large dome with an elliptical plan; this shape is said to have been chosen because of its similarity to an egg, so as to encourage residents to sell eggs to raise funds for its construction.  History  A small church dedicated to the Assumption of Mary was established in Mƒ°arr in around 1400, and it was repaired in 1600. The village formed part of the parish of Mosta until it became a separate parish on 12 October 1898. The old church therefore became a parish church, but residents wanted to build a new and larger church in its place. Parish priest Girolamo Chetcuti organised a campaign to raise funds for the new church, and he purchased the land on which the building was constructed. The first stone of the building was laid down on 2 June 1912. The new church was constructed around the old one, which was demolished in 1918. Several masons and master builders were involved in the church's design and construction. The initial plans were drawn up by ƒ†ammri Camilleri, who also oversaw the roofing of the sacristy and some of the chapels together with the builder Indri Deguara. ƒäensu Galea oversaw the initial stages of construction, and the plans of the dome were drawn up by ƒ†iomaria Camilleri and ƒ†anni A. Cilia. Camilleri oversaw the construction of the dome. The residents of Mƒ°arr contributed to the church's construction by providing labour and by selling eggs, fruit and livestock to raise funds. When the building was still under construction, part of it was temporarily roofed over to allow Mass to be celebrated inside. Between 1933 and 1935, through the efforts of parish priest Edgar Salomone a number of buildings were expropriated by the government and they were demolished in order to make way for a public square and a parvis in front of the church. Two bells were installed in the belfries on 1 September 1935. The almost-completed church was blessed on 13 August 1939 by Girolamo Chetcuti, but construction halted soon afterwards because of World War II. The dome's lantern and the upper levels of the belfries were designed by ƒ†u≈ºeppi Damato, and construction of these began on 25 February 1946. The building was completed later that year.  Architecture  The church's dome which dominates the Mƒ°arr skyline The church has a neoclassical design which bears similarities to the Rotunda of Mosta, which is in turn based on the Pantheon in Rome. Contrasting with the Mosta church's circular dome, the cupola of Mƒ°arr church is elliptical, and this unusual shape resembling an egg is said to have been chosen to encourage residents to sell eggs in order to fund its construction. The church has two bell towers and a large dome which is painted silver, and the latter dominates the village's skyline. Internally, the church contains seven altars.  Artworks  The church's altarpiece was painted by Lazzaro Pisani, and the building also contains a number of paintings by Ramiro and Guido Cal√¨. Another painting of the Virgin Mary by Pisani which was located in the old church is now found in the sacristy. The church's titular statue of the Assumption of Mary was purchased from Paris, and some other statues located in the church were purchased from Rome or Lecce in Italy. The church also includes some statues made by the Gozitan sculptor Wistin Camilleri.

Plot In 1949, at a party on Coney Island thrown by Fred Trump Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz have to convince a skeptical CBS to greenlight a television show starring a red-headed caucasian woman and a man from Cuba. As Lucille becomes disillusioned with Desi -- he's flirting with another woman -- she meets Isidore Strauss, the author's grandfather, and allows him to kiss her. This sets off a series of events that will echo through both their lives for decades.

Life  McCormick was born on April 17, 1831 in Ithaca, New York. He was the son of Jacob Miller McCormick, a veteran of the War of 1812 and prominent Ithaca resident, and Catherine Conrad. His maternal side was of Dutch ancestry. His paternal great- grandfather was Joseph McCormick, a Scotch-Irish immigrant who lived near the Giants' Causeway in County Antrim and came to America in 1760. McCormick attended Union College in Schenectady, graduating in 1850 at the age of 19. He then studied law in the law office of prominent Ithaca attorneys Ferris and Cushing, and was admitted to the bar in 1852. He initially practiced law in Ithaca, but later switched to railroad work. As he already took a course on civil engineering at Union College, he moved to Indiana and joined a classmate also working with railroads. McCormick later moved to New York City, where he intended to practice law, but Augustus Whiton, the superintendent of the Eastern Division of the Erie Railroad, convinced him to accept a position with the Erie Railroad. He would come to work for them for fifteen years. In 1856, he moved to Port Jervis, initially as a fuel agent for the Delaware Division and later as resident engineer and paymaster. He later worked with the freight department in New York City and Chicago. In 1870, McCormick permanently moved to Port Jervis, where he worked in the real estate and insurance business and dealt in musical instruments. He served a number of local offices, including village president, a member of the board of trustees, justice of the peace, sewer commissioner, village treasurer, a member of the board of education, chief engineer of the fire department, and police justice. In 1891, McCormick was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Democrat, representing the Orange County 2nd District. He served in the Assembly in 1892. In 1873, McCormick married Mary Gertrude Broadhead of Port Jervis. Their son Frank died young. McCormick was a member of the Presbyterian church and led the singing for more than 30 years.

The border is 555 km (345 m) in length and runs from the tripoint with Thailand in the west to tripoint with Vietnam in the east. Description The border starts in the west at the tripoint with Thailand at Preah Chambot peak in the D√¢ngr√™k Mountains. The border then proceeds overland to the south-east, reaching the Tonle Repou river and following this eastwards to the Mekong River. The Mekong here is extremely wide, forming the Si Phan Don islands area, with the border along the southern rim of this riverine lake, before leaving it and proceeding overland to the north. The border then turns east, reaching the Kong River and following this for a period, before proceeding eastwards over to the Vietnamese tripoint in the Annamite Mountains. History The border checkpoint at Nong Nok Khiene From the 1860s France began establishing a presence in the region, initially in modern Cambodia and Vietnam, and the colony of French Indochina was created in 1887. Laos was at this point part of the Kingdom of Siam (the old name for Thailand), however all areas east of the Mekong were annexed to French Indochina in 1893 following the Franco-Siamese War. In 1905 the southern Lao regions of Stung Treng and Ratanakiri were transferred to Cambodia based on their historical affiliation to the Khmer kingdom, with a small area going to Vietnam. It is thought that the French authorities thereafter used the historic boundary of Stung Treng province as the Cambodia-Laos border, though as it was at this point merely an internal administrative line running through a remote area there was no pressing need to define it in detail. Both Laos and Cambodia gained independence in 1954 and the border became one between two sovereign states. The border area was volatile throughout much of the 1950s-80s owing to the various conflicts in Indochina. There were also tensions over irredentist Lao claims to Stung Treng, with Cambodia conducting a Khmer-isation campaign in the region in the 1950s-60s. As a result no demarcation took place and Lao-Cambodian relations remained frosty, deteriorating further during the rule of the nationalist-Communist Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975-79. In 2000 the two countries announced that they would start work on demarcating the border. Whilst much work has been done, by late 2019 there were parts of the border still undemarcated. Border crossings There is currently one official crossing point, at Nong Nok Khiene (Laos) - Tropaeng Kreal (Cambodia).

Lim has exhibited both in Singapore and internationally, participating in exhibitions such as such as the Gwangju Biennale (2002) and the Biennale of Sydney (2004). In 2005, Lim represented Singapore at the 51st Venice Biennale with MIKE.  Education and personal life  Lim was born in Singapore in 1972. He studied briefly at the then-LASALLE Art College and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in Singapore, before embarking on a 3 year degree programme at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University, Australia. Graduating in 1997, Lim continued to participate in numerous exhibitions locally and internationally. Lim is married to Chinese artist, Cao Fei.  Career  For the Gwangju Biennale 2002, Lim conceptualised the project Alter #10, which involved the addition of a \\"fictitious\\" floor to the exhibition space of the biennale by doctoring exhibition maps in published materials, as well as renaming floors and altering elevator buttons. This was done without obvious announcements, and emerged only six months later in an article by Singaporean art critic Lee Weng Choy in Art AsiaPacific number 37. In 2002, for the work Alter #11, Lim proposed that a single rifle shot be fired into an art gallery on the campus of Singapore's National Institute of Education, executed by a trained sniper located at the military firing range located one kilometre away from the campus. The project was eventually unrealised, with the bureaucratic, legal, and ethical concerns preventing the work from being carried out. Alter #11 would be the subject of one of the four episodes of the TV documentary series, 4x4‚ÄîEpisodes of Singapore Art (2005) by Singaporean artist, Ho Tzu Nyen. In 2003, the Singapore performance company, TheatreWorks, presented the LIM TZAY CHUEN project conceived and directed by Ong Keng Sen. A graduation project of the pioneer class of the Theatre Training & Research Programme (TTRP), it was the final culmination of work by the nine graduating students from the TTRP Class of 2001, which involved the active participation of Ong, Lim, and Lok Meng Chue. An immersion into the works of Lim, five exercises were introduced based on Lim's works, transferring them into physical and theatrical frames. At the 2004 Biennale of Sydney, Lim designed and coordinated A Proposition That You May Want to Consider, a project addressed to the public. The proposition delineated that \\"enterprising\\" individuals who collected certain pages from the 2004 Biennale of Sydney catalogues would be receive use of the Artspace Gallery 1, AUD$4000, 4 nights hotel accommodation and official inclusion as an invited \\"artist\\" to the biennale. At the art event, Nuit Blanche, Paris, in October 2004, Lim proposed seeding the clouds over the city with a non-toxic quantity of organic pheromones for the work, Alter #16. With such pheromones reputed to possess aphrodisiac qualities, Lim sought to literally send a rain of love down upon the world capital of romance. The work was unrealised, being dismissed by French authorities despite Lim proposing collaboration and consultation with meteorologists, health institutions and other related agencies. In 2005, Lim represented Singapore at the 51st Venice Biennale with MIKE, curated by Eugene Tan. The first solo presentation at the Venice Biennale's Singapore Pavilion, Lim proposed to bring the 80-ton Merlion statue from Singapore to Venice as a tongue-in-cheek comment on tourism, self-representation, and capitalism. The project never materialised due to the lack of approval from relevant parties, pointing towards the bureaucracy of modern society. Surprisingly, the National Arts Council, who had commissioned the work, did not insist on a substitution of artists, instead working with curator and artist to present the unrealised project in Venice. The Singapore Pavilion was converted into a large public toilet, and outside it was a signboard with the words \\"I wanted to bring MIKE over.\\" The catalogue displayed digitally altered photographs of a missing Merlion in Singapore, as well as a fictitious newspaper article that lauded the successful feat of bringing over the statue to Venice. The work has been interpreted as a work that signalled the height of the shift towards conceptual art in Singapore, which had started in the 1970s. In 2005, A Work by Lim Tzay Chuen was exhibited at the Earl Lu Gallery of the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore. The solo exhibition by Lim featured an almost entirely empty, meditative space, placing an emphasis of the 'white cube' gallery space.  Art  Lim's practice alters the conditions of contexts such as a gallery space, an exhibition, or a catalogue, leading viewers to critically re-evaluate their perceptions and assumptions of social, economic, cultural and political processes. Described as ‚Äòalterations‚Äô, ‚Äògaps‚Äô or ‚Äòdelays‚Äô, such interventions are typically ‚Äòdiscovered rather than ‚Äòexhibited‚Äô. Lim further describes his work as getting institutions to \\"entertain the possible\\", or being concerned with \\"offering\\" solutions to possible problems.

Early life Haraguchi was born in Yokosuka, Japan in 1946. He studied at the Nihon University in Tokyo. Work =Mono-ha= Haraguchi was associated with Mono-ha (School of Things), a 1960s art movement in Japan and Korea that explored the correlations between the natural and industrial worlds. While his contemporaries, Nobuo Sekine, Lee Ufan and Kishio Suga are known for using natural materials, Haraguchi used industrial components such as waste oil, I-beams, automobile parts, plastics, and rubber. =Anti-war works= Haraguchi often recreated detritus from airplanes, ships and weapons of mass destruction in his sculptures, such as A-7 E Corsair II (2011), Tsumu 147 (1966), and Battleship Ref. A (1966). His iconic sculpture A-4E Skyhawk (1968‚Äì69) was a reproduction at full-scale of the U.S. Navy fighter jet of the same name. The sculpture was created behind barricades at Nihon University during a student demonstration when riot police took over the campus during the protests against the Vietnam War. =Matter and Mind (Oil Pool)= His best known work is Oil Pool (1971), that was first shown in Kassel, Germany at Documenta 6. These sculptures consist of a low-slung rectangular containment structure constructed of steel and filled with thick, opaque waste oil with a glossy surface that appears to be polished black stone. During his lifetime, he created about 20 of these sculptures throughout the world. The sculpture, in its manifestation in Tehran, measures 14 by 21 feet, and 7 inches deep. It contains approximately 1,190 gallons of oil. The official title of the sculpture is Matter and Mind. Critical reception Haraguchi's work has been described as simultaneously personal and political; as his birthplace, Yokosuka, is a port city where the United States deployed its forces during the Vietnam war era. His work references the military- industrial complex and the correlation between Japanese modernity and the United States military relationship to it. Exhibitions Haraguchi's work has been exhibited the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Tate Museum, the Hamburger Kunsthalle, the St√§dtische Galerie, Munich, among other venues.

On April 5, 1933, the Young Andorrans seized the Andorran Parliament. These actions were preceded by the arrival of Colonel Ren√©-Jules Baulard with 50 gendarmes and the mobilization of 200 local militias or sometent led by the S√≠ndic Francesc Cairat.  History  = Context = The interwar period in Andorra was characterized by a continuation of the economic crisis that arose in the second half of the 19th century. The country lived very precariously on the economy of the Ancien Regime. Although an attempt was made to outsource the economy, it did not take off and waves of emigration continued to decimate the population and its activity. Over time, the interwar period in Andorra meant an extension of the popular revolts and noble uprisings of the previous decade. It was at this time that the country saw a wave of protests with which, for the first time, it was possible to implement universal male suffrage - authorized only to men of legal age and Andorran nationality. This was an unprecedented fact because before that the country was still living under the New Reformation regime. Although it was a step forward to approve it, the New Reformation was completely obsolete and inadequate with the turn of the twentieth century. It continued to give the votes to a privileged few and did not contemplate the participation of women. This meant that the bulk of the population was excluded from being able to participate in the country's politics. The waves of Andorrans fleeing the Andorran economic situation to settle in France or Catalunya lead Andorran politics to see the so-called Revolution of 1933. From outside the associations of Andorran emigrants virulently criticized the Andorran government's policy, through newspapers they brought new liberal and capitalist currents to Andorra. The General Council wanted to censor the opinion that was published abroad because it questioned the New Reformation. Andorran politicians wanted to show that Andorra was a \\"bucolic\\" place, with the aim of avoiding any kind of foreign interference in Andorran affairs. The government tried to ban the collection of signatures that the emigrants carried out in Andorra, to give the right to vote to all adults and change the Constitution to transform Andorra into a constitutional monarchy. From Catalunya there was widespread support for this change of regime and thanks to each other, the Pariatges and their feudal character began to be criticized for the first time. The establishment of the Spanish Republic did not change Castilian ambitions towards Andorra. The country continued to be treated as part of Spanish territory. Spain sought to eradicate the co-principality, while France tried to preserve it. The construction of the FHASA hydroelectric plant changed the country's economic course. The project was conceived as a mechanism for modernizing the country and economic activation. Its presence did not broadly change the country's politics, although it allowed the entry of new ideological currents that until then had never set foot in Andorran soil: socialism, communism and anarcho- syndicalism. The universal suffrage granted to men managed to be approved, but the Spanish Civil War and subsequent Second World War stopped the modernization and economic activation of Andorra.  French and Spanish imperialism  France and Spain have always considered Andorra their territory. It has been disputed practically since Andorra obtained the Pariatge. The beginning of the era of nationalism did not change this situation much. Castile within its concept of pan-Hispanic nationalism dubbed Andorra a Hispanic territory. France, within its concept of \\"natural borders\\", treated Andorra as a French protectorate. The Andorran protectorate regime made the governor the vicar and representative of the co-prince which should normally correspond. 20th century Andorrans had to register in France and the passport granted to them was protected by France. Influenced by Catalanism, which found it incongruous that Andorra continues to be a fief, many Andorrans were taking steps to recognize Andorra as a separate nation-state. This is how the General Council addressed the League of Nations during the 1930s so that it could intervene in the Andorran affair in view of the paternalistic attitudes of Spain and France. At this time, Andorra achieved the Andorran national regime, which did not differ much from the national regime in the French colonies. Spain claimed its \\"right to conquest\\" over Andorra and for this reason tried to influence education. Spain wanted to ban the Catalan Andorran schools. The desire to be and be independent ends up in the mood of Andorrans. Wanting to edit their own labels, looking to introduce a national system, would command on the Spanish school teachers looking to enter the Catalan school, addressing the United Nations, among others, are examples clear that Andorra did not want to belong to either side.  Catalan and Andorran nationalism  The Andorran position towards Catalanism was open, because many Andorrans defended the right of Catalans to self-determination, but contained, because the pan-Hispanic and pan-French projects clearly endangered the ill-defined status of Andorra. Although from Catalunya, Andorra was seen as a separate and admirable country as it was the only independent Catalan state, this independence was more de-jure than de-facto. The refusal of the League of Nations to accept Andorra as a full member exemplified this. Andorrans felt and saw themselves as a separate country. None of this meant that Andorran politicians had to play the game of ambiguity in order to preserve the status of a territory that is being challenged everywhere. The Catalan press reported on various occasions that it was necessary to get rid of the Pariatges and transform the Andorran state into a republican regime. The currents of the time influenced many Andorrans and for this reason there were many who were committed to the Republic and the self-determination of Catalonia. France and Spain never accepted the Andorrans in favor of the Andorran republic. Any republican claim was interpreted by these two states as a direct influence of Catalanism. Both averse to any right to self- determination, France and Spain often left their differences aside to impose their will on the Andorran parliament, in order to avoid progress in the Andorran territory. For the representatives of the French co-prince, independence was a purely anti-French attitude, no matter where it came from, from Catalonia as much as from the colonies or Andorra. = Reasons for the Revolution =  Grievances  Changes in the co-principality regime were vehemently demanded in order to advance the country's policy in order to improve the actions taken against the economic crisis. In addition, the Andorran parliament found itself in a series of situations that were contrary to the free exercise of its sovereignty. France and the Vatican repeatedly limited the action of parliament, questioning any decision. Decisions made by parliament that were interfered with include: * parliament granted the concession to a foreign betting agency to bet on horse racing in exchange for an annual payment. The aim was to build a hospital, a residence for the godparents of the country, spas, etc. The permanent delegates of the co- princes annulled the decision taken by parliament, * Spain established the first secular schools. Public education was within the power of parliament, so it asked for a subsidy from Spain. But the bishop did not accept it and refused because he wanted the church to continue controlling the school system, * parliament appointed a delegate, Andreu Mass√≥ i L√≥pez, close to the Catalan government to support Catalan-language education in Andorra. But as Andreu was a Catalanist, France rejected his appointment and the co-princes expelled him, * the delivery of mail between Spain and France was not well received by the parliament, which requested the entry of the country as an autonomous member of the corresponding international body, without consulting the co-princes, * the parliament refused to recognize the appointment of the episcopal notary, * the parliament commissioned a study for a civil registry in the principality, a prerogative that belonged to the recots of each parish, which were under the order of the bishop, * a parliamentary committee presented in 1933, to the French permanent delegate, a petition with 240 signatures for the establishment of universal male suffrage. The Permanent Delegate replied by shouting at the General Council for reasons unrelated to the plea. * parliament agreed to draft a Constitution for the country in 1933, but the bishop did not agree  Bucolism and idealism  The crisis of the 19th century caused Andorrans to emigrate to other countries. Andorran emigrant communities were set up in Barcelona and Besiers. The one in Barcelona was the most important. Globally a part of the European continent lived to the rhythm of the Crazy Years. That is, the American Way of Life was imported from the United States, penetrating modern capitalism. Cinema, trusts, marketing, skyscrapers, ... everything develops radically. It grows so much that the bubble bursts in 1929 causing the planet to invoke the so-called Great Depression. Andorrans living outside Andorra lived the Crazy Years in their skin. Life was going relatively well for them. Many decided to get started in business. There are many notable examples of this period. However, the most important thing to note is, at least, the change in mindsets. In Spain it had just been proclaimed in the Republic, France had been one for some time. At the same time, workers' strikes are beginning to be heard in France, in Europe universal male suffrage is being demanded ... Obviously Andorrans living abroad were not left out of these events, on the contrary because in fact they sympathized with it. In Andorra, history was something else. Andorrans who had stayed in the country had not experienced these changes. Life was monotonous, folkloric. The only relevant point was the religious festivities and the obsession with road construction which translated into FHASA. The First World War stopped the tension of the Andorra Question or, in any case, loosened it. The General Council was nourished by the model of the New Reformation. It was a totally estamental model in which only household heads could be chosen. The parliament was therefore very immobilist, with little desire for change, well established thanks to the privileges it had been accumulating. From the outside, mainly the Spanish press, there was an absolutely idealized, bucolic image, which the Andorran parliament reinforced. It was intended because in this way the maintenance of the established order was guaranteed. = Areas of change =  The abolition of tithes and the rectification of the economic situation  The economic crisis dragged on in the second half of the 19th century finally came to an end thanks to the construction of Andorra's Hydroelectric Forces, a Public Limited Company. The desired tertiarization of the country needed to open the way in and out of the national territory. Without this there was no way to invest in other fields. Communications in Andorra became a battlefield in the interwar period. If in other countries the Industrial Revolution was synonymous with railways, in Andorra it was called roads. Road construction needed money and the Andorran parliament did not have it. It was for this reason that during the interwar period it took important steps that led to the abolition of tithes due to the episcopal co-prince. Through the constitution of the Administrative Board of Roads an attempt was made to build the first roads with public money. Put to work, the Andorran administration realized that it had no capacity to continue. The lack of resources led to the abolition of tithes in the Mitra. The diocese of Urgell refused, until the Road Board finally managed to reason with him. The co-prince saw in this request another way to deprive him of his right to be co-sovereign of Andorra. Despite the abolition of tithes, the Andorran parliament only managed to pave a three-meter-wide path between Soldeu and Pas de la Casa. The board had to go back to the initial idea of concessions. In this second phase, the Andorran parliament decided to take advantage of the installation of power plants around the Pyrenees to attract foreign capital with which to get the country out of incommunicado detention. In 1929 the General Council granted a hydraulic energy company permission to produce electricity in Andorra in exchange for building roads there. The 75-year concession of FHASA (Forces Hidroel√®ctriques d'Andorra) to the businessman Boussac i Lloren√ß G√≥mez in 1929 finally meant entering the capitalist world and the Industrial Revolution. In 1933 the company complied and built a road from Andorra la Vella to the French border and in 1934 from Andorra la Vella to Ordino. The electrification of the country allowed an important leap for Andorrans. The first banks, police and radios were installed,  The campaign for universal male suffrage  Andorran immigrants from Barcelona collected signatures in Andorra with the aim of approving the universal suffrage granted to men of legal age and Andorran nationality. They created a magazine that spread opinion in the country and an association to support its initiatives from Andorra. The law in Andorra prohibited all kinds of associations and did not explicitly provide for freedom of expression. Due to this the collection was completely complicated: * The magazine was censored by the Andorran parliament * Young Andorrans had to meet in secret * Signature collection campaigns were closed * The Andorran administration banned all propaganda pamphlets The bans did not get the Andorran Youth to retreat. For this reason, the Andorran parliament agreed to accept the signatures. But parliament knew that a decision like that would be rejected by the co-princes, who did so simply because in France the streets were on fire because the government there also did not want to give citizens the right to vote. The French pannational project would not accept a decision taken by the Andorran parliament that approved a vote extension. Thus, the Andorran parliament avoided, on the one hand, the criticism against it for not wanting to authorize the right to vote and the collection of signatures, and on the other hand, it also pointed to the list of grievances as another cause for criticizing the co-princes. On January 17, 1933, a delegation from the General Council addressed the permanent delegates of the co-prince in Perpignan to present the application. The permanent delegation shouted at the Andorran delegation for trying to re-install casinos in the country and for extending the telephone lines, that France and Spain were disputing, without having previously communicated to the French co-prince. The request for extending the right to vote waas accepted by France but it warned that it would be necessary before asking for the opinion of the episcopal co- prince under the Pariahs. Parliament interpreted a refusal and told the population that the delegations of the co-princes were opposed. The French delegation decided to send the proposal directly to Co-Prince Albert Lebrun and inform him that it should be approved but that it should first be consulted with the population itself, by organizing a popular consultation.  The FHASA strikes  Old FHASA building, now transformed into the Museum of Electricity. The construction of the hydroelectric power plant needed a significant mass of workers. The company hired more than two thousand workers. In order to reactivate domestic economic activity, the General Council wanted the company to hire Andorran staff. But in the end, much labor would be Spanish, French, Catalan or Galician. Most of the technical positions, by contrast, were Swiss. Working conditions were terrible. The company increased working hours without consensus or agreement, workers had no days off or breaks, worked for an insufficient salary to survive, there were no hygienic conditions, etc. Some ended up staying in the country, others left. There was a clear difference between the workers and technicians. The technicians earned twice as much as those who risked their lives building the plant. It is these living conditions typical of the initial introduction of capitalism that Andorra seeks new ideological currents that until then had never set foot in national territory. The workers of the power station belonged mostly to the Catalan Regional Labor Confederation, a subsidiary of the CNT, the anarchist union. Catalan unions supported the demands of the power plant workers, who demanded decent living, hygiene and working conditions. The Andorran parliament, which was made up of a bourgeois upper class, never saw the need to regulate the labor market and saw the workers' demands as a threat to the disappearance of the co-principality regime, with clear wills to transform Andorra into a Republic. The Andorran Youth Association joined the demands of the FHASA workers and because of this, the parliament found another rival. Three successive strikes that took place between 1931 and 1933 lead the Andorran parliament to form the first national police force with the stated intention of repressing any strike or demonstration contrary to what was dictated by parliament. = The Revolution of 1933 =  The coup d'etat  For the Young Andorrans, the consultations with the co-princes were seen as another way to wrap up the exchange, so as not to respond positively to the request. From their point of view, it was incongruous to have to ask the co-princes for approval when the Andorran people represented in parliament should make the decision. The Andorran delegations saw a form of vassalship and a waste of time. Sending personal letters among the co-princes was seen as one more way to waste even more time. The multitude of travel and bureaucratic letters was not necessary for a simple extension of the right to vote that had already been previously approved through a signature collection campaign. For all this, the Young Andorrans, taking advantage of the fact that the Andorran police were busy repressing the FHASA strikes, burst into the Casa de la Vall on April 5, 1933, confiscating its keys, closing its doors and forcing parliament to approve the extension of the right to vote. The coup began with the reading of a manifesto in parliament: * A \\"democratic constitution\\" that delimited the duties and obligations of the co-princes * A constitution that guarantees the rights of the \\"Andorran people\\" * \\"Freedom of conscience, thought and word\\" * \\"Guarantee of individual and collective rights\\" * Parliamentary sessions open to the public * Voting age set at 23 * Approval of \\"universal male suffrage\\" * Labor rights, female education, \\"teaching in Catalan, without vetoing any other language\\" It started from then a tug-of-war with the General Council. Were it not for the usual interference, it was probable that the General Council would not yield. But it did and ended up approving the electoral reform from which universal male suffrage was established in Andorra. Young Andorrans began to spread the word.  The detachment of gendarmes  French co-prince Albert Lebrun. The coup was very badly received by the delegations of the two co- princes. It was considered from France and the Vatican that its sovereignty was being disputed. That is, delegations did not tolerate an association being created with the power to make decisions over it. Moreover, they also did not accept the power of the Andorran parliament to approve the Law extending the right to vote. But the tug-of-war between parliamentarians and Young Andorrans bore fruit, the parliament agreed and ended up opposing the two co-princes of its own volition. For everything, the French co-prince warned the parliament: either abolish the electoral reform or send a detachment of gendarmes to Andorra. The discrepancies are not saved and France finally sends its detachment of gendarmes. The Andorran parliament rebuked the French state for considering it as a subject and not as its own personality, which is why it decided to support electoral reform. The bishop sent letters to Madrid to report that he did not agree at all with the coup and the attitude of the Andorran parliament. He wanted to send civil guards into the country, because in this way he would make it clear to France that the episcopal co-prince also commanded the country. In Madrid, he was replaced and the French state was accused of behaving badly against Andorra. Behind the accusations of an \\"evil\\" attitude was, above all, an advantage of the situation to take over Andorran territory. The Andorran parliament sent a letter to the Vatican, denouncing the abuse of the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell. The co-princes dismiss the Andorran parliament and create a commission set up by Andorrans to manage the situation until calm is restored. In addition, they cut the economic supply of the parliament. France saw in the demand for more democracy a \\"Catalanist coup\\" in Andorra. All criticism was perceived by France as an \\"anti-French\\" attitude. The commission never saw the light of day. The members who were to form it refused. Many Andorrans fled to take refuge in La Seu d'Urgell from where they appealed to the resistance. The gendarmes began to detain the Andorran authorities en-masse to force them to surrender, while they openly disobeyed. The fact that the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya supported the revolt could explain why France saw a Catalanist coup d'etat. But ERC simply wanted the establishment of a democracy in Andorra. However, thanks to ERC, the Basque press ended up leaking that a Swiss person would become the spokesman for the Andorran parliament at the League of Nations. Andorra defended that France was violating its rights and the latter replied that Andorra was not large enough to be considered a separate nation-state. Young Andorrans manage to gain international public opinion. The press, which saw no abnormality in demanding reforms like the one that the Andorran Youth wanted, reported serious criticism against the French state for its management of the conflict. Paris eventually gave in to public opinion. In general, the press harshly criticized the attitude of the two co-princes. The press described the attitude of the French state as belonging to the Salazar regime. Paris saw no alternative and resolved to hold new parliamentary elections by applying the universal male suffrage system.  The 1933 general election  In the elections, two rival camps ran. Those in favor of changing the co-principality regime and making Andorra a sovereign state with a constitutional monarchy and those opposed to all this. The former would like universal suffrage for men, the latter do not want it. Uni√≥ Andorrana constituted the reconversion of the Young Andorrans into a political party. Opponents took the form of the Integral Nationalist Group . The French gendarmerie remained patrolling Andorra by order of the co-prince. According to the official version, they had to guarantee calm, but the strikes in FHASA and the behavior of the Andorran and French police led them to conclude at that time that the gendarmerie were kept in place because they wanted to repress Andorran trade unionism. So much so that the beatings provided against FHASA protesters were popularly described as a \\"punitive expedition.\\" The elections ended up giving an overwhelming victory to Integral Nationalist Group. Andorrans living in Andorra had never experienced the radical changes that were taking place abroad and, therefore, it was more than likely that the change in mentality of Andorran emigrants was not the same as non-emigrants. = The kingdom of Andorra = Bor√≠s Sk√≥syrev, the king of Andorra in 1934. Flag of the Kingdom of Andorra, under the rule of Boris I, used in 1934. During the First World War, a communist regime was established in Russia. Supporters of the monarchy and absolutism fled en-masse due to the persecution given to them by the new regime. They are the so-called white √©migr√©s. In Andorra there was never any communist regime and it was in no danger of falling into communism. Boris Mikhalovich Skovirev-Mavrusov was a white Russian who had been born in the current capital of Lithuania. A Polyglot, he served the Foreign Office until 1925 as a spy. He fled Russia when the 1917 revolution broke out. He sought political asylum, passed through the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and obtained the Nasen passport. In 1933, Rodam√≥n arrived in Andorran. He saw the situation of the Revolution of 1933 and took the opportunity to proclaim himself King of Andorra. The Andorran parliament agreed to make Andorra a business center. He told them that during his stay in the Netherlands he worked for the Dutch royal family. He even claimed that he had the title of Count of Orange. Establishes residence in the chalet of La Margineda in Andorra la Vella. Flattered, the parliament proclaims him king of Andorra and has a new Constitution drafted. 10,000 copies are distributed. He was expelled from Andorra by the co-princes after they saw the interviews he gave to The Times, Daily Herald and Ahora. France was immediately informed of the proclamation. On July 21, four civil guards and a sergeant were put in charge of expelling him.

Elijah Page, Briley Piper, and Darrell Hoadley, were convicted of the torture and murder of Poage. Page and Piper were sentenced to death, while Hoadley was sentenced to life in prison. Page was executed by lethal injection on July 11, 2007, becoming the first person executed in South Dakota in over sixty years, and the first person executed in South Dakota since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Piper remains on death row, and is the only person still on death row in the state. Background Chester Allan Poage was born on July 4, 1980 in Norton County, Kansas. He grew up on a farm just outside Norton, but moved with his family to Rapid City, South Dakota in 1994. In 1996, his father committed suicide, just days after his parents had filed for divorce. The family moved back to Norton but later moved to Spearfish, South Dakota while Poage was at college. Prior to his death, Poage was attending Northwest Kansas Technical School and was a half-year from graduating in communications technology. Murder On the evening of March 12, 2000, Page, Piper, and Hoadley met up with Poage at his family home in Spearfish. The four of them were friends and had met up to play video games together. Poage's mother and sister were in Florida on vacation at the time, meaning the house was empty. Later on, the four of them left the house and drove in Poage's Chevrolet Blazer to the house where Page, Piper, and Hoadley were staying. Once inside, Page produced a .22 caliber pistol, which he'd stolen from Poage's home, and ordered Poage to get on the floor. The three men planned to rob Poage and steal items from his home. As Poage lay on the floor, he was kicked repeatedly by Piper until he became unconscious. He was then tied up with a cord and placed in a chair. Piper put a tire iron across Poage's feet to prevent him from moving. When Poage regained consciousness he pleaded with his attackers to let him go. Poage was forced to drink beer with crushed pills and hydrochloric acid. Page demanded Poage's ATM card, which Poage gave to him. The perpetrators then discussed their plan to murder Poage while stood in front of him. Poage was forced into his own vehicle and was driven approximately seven miles to Higgins Gulch, a remote wooded area in the Black Hills. He was ordered out of the vehicle and pushed into thick snow. He was stripped naked, apart from his undershirt, shoes, and socks. Poage was then escorted downhill toward a small icy creek. During the walk he was beaten repeatedly until he was forced to lie down in the creek where he was attacked again. Poage was stabbed by Page in the neck with a knife. The three men then decided to kill him. Poage requested to be let into his vehicle so he could warm himself up. He said he preferred to bleed to death in the warmth instead of freezing to death in the cold. Piper agreed to the request if he washed blood off his body first. As Poage washed himself, Piper changed his mind, and Poage was violently dragged back into the creek by the three men as they attempted to drown him. Poage was then finally killed by having rocks thrown at his head. Page later stated that he and Hoadley ended Poage's life by dropping several large rocks on his head. Piper's brief contends that he did not take part in the drowning attempt or stabbings. Piper argues that he had returned to Poage's vehicle as he was being killed. According to Piper, Hoadley was the one that threw the final rock which killed Poage, but at that point in time, Piper was not there to personally witness the killing. However, Piper allegedly admitted standing on Poage's neck to assist Hoadley in drowning him, and then reportedly stabbed Poage twice. Page and Hoadley admitted they both dropped heavy rocks on Poage's head, actions which they believe are what finally killed him. Hours after the beatings first began, Poage was left for dead in the creek in the early hours of March 13. The men killed him because they didn't want a witness to the robbery of his home. Aftermath Page, Piper, and Hoadley drove away from the scene in Poage's vehicle. They returned to his house and stole several items from the family home. Page claimed Poage's vehicle as well as a stereo system and some clothes. The men then drove to visit Piper's sister in Hannibal, Missouri, hoping they could stay with her for a while. She refused to let them stay with her, so they headed back to South Dakota. They traveled to Rapid City where they used Poage's ATM card to withdraw cash and also sold some of his property. The three men then split up and went separate ways, with Piper deciding to return to his home state of Alaska. One month later, on April 22, 2000, a woman came across the remains of Poage in Higgins Gulch. A forensic pathologist identified the remains and later confirmed the deceased man was Poage. It was determined that stab wounds and blunt force injury to the head is what Poage had died from. On April 25, 2000, police interviewed Hoadley and he gave a statement detailing his involvement in the murder. He confessed to the crime and gave police the names of his accomplices. Warrants were then issued for both Page and Piper, who had fled the state. Three days later, law enforcement located and arrested Page in Texas. Piper was tracked down in Alaska and was arrested for first degree murder. Page voluntarily described to authorities the details surrounding Poage's murder. Piper also gave a statement and described Poage's torture and murder, as well as his participation in the crime. Both men were then subsequently extradited to South Dakota and jailed in Lawrence County. Page and Piper later pleaded guilty to and were convicted of first degree felony murder. They were both sentenced to death, while Hoadley received a life sentence. Page was executed by lethal injection on July 11, 2007, while Piper remains on death row. He is the only person on death row in South Dakota. Poage is buried at Norton Cemetery in his hometown of Norton, Norton County, Kansas. Perpetrators =Elijah Page= Elijah Page (December 11, 1981 ‚Äì July 11, 2007) was born in Titusville, Florida. While he was still young, he moved with his family to Kansas City, Missouri. Page reportedly had a very troubled childhood. He lived with his family in abandoned buildings without heat or utilities. He was also allegedly sexually abused by his mother as a 2-year-old. Page pleaded guilty to Poage's death and waived his right to have a jury determine his sentence. On February 16, 2001, he was sentenced to death by judge Warren Johnson. By August 2006, Page ordered his attorney to stop all appeals and just allow his execution to proceed. He reportedly said he was tired of living the life of a condemned man. Page waived his appeals and sped up his execution. He was executed via lethal injection at South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls on July 11, 2007. He was the first person executed in South Dakota in over sixty years and the first person executed in South Dakota since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 following the Gregg v. Georgia decision. Page was executed at the age of 25, and remains the youngest person executed in South Dakota since the reinstatement of the death penalty. No one younger than Page has been executed in the United States since his execution. His last meal was steak, Jalapeno poppers, onion rings, a salad and ice cream. He had no final statement. =Briley Piper= Briley Wayne Piper (born March 1980) grew up in Anchorage, Alaska. He allegedly set fire to his parents bedroom at the age of 3. When he was 13, he was arrested for allegedly grabbing a woman and was also arrested for assault after robbing a classmate at knife point. Prosecutors argue Piper was the ringleader of the group and was good at manipulating people. Like Page, Piper pleaded guilty to Poage's death in January 2001, waiving his right to have a jury determine his sentence. Judge Warren Johnson sentenced him to death on January 19, 2001. Piper appealed his conviction, and in 2009, the State Supreme Court overturned the death sentence, arguing that a jury should decide his fate. The jury sentenced him to death in August 2011, with the sentence being upheld in 2019. With the execution of Charles Russell Rhines on November 4, 2019, Piper is now the only person left on death row in South Dakota. He remains incarcerated at South Dakota State Penitentiary awaiting execution. =Darrell Hoadley= Darrell R. Hoadley (born November 5, 1979) was born in Laramie, Wyoming. Like Page and Piper, he had a difficult childhood and was abused by his mother and her male friends. By the time of the murder he was living in Lead, South Dakota, and had a daughter. Unlike Page and Piper, Hoadley did not waive his right to have a jury determine his sentence. He pleaded not guilty at his trial. Because the jury could not unanimously agree on a death sentence he was spared the death penalty. Hoadley was sentenced to life in prison in 2001. He remains incarcerated at South Dakota State Penitentiary.

She notably opposed women's suffrage and higher education for women. Life Soulsby was born in London in 1856. Her parents were Susan Sybilla (born Thompson) and Christopher Percy Soulsby and she spent her early childhood in New Zealand. She and her mother, who ran a school, returned to England in 1867 after her father died. She was very close to her mother who provided her education. When they were living together in Salcombe in Devon their whole day was devoted to household chores, serving tea for visitors and good works in the parish. On Sundays she ran the Sunday School and both of them wrote for magazines. Lucy described her day to a magazine who were intrigued but her mother would not allow it to be published. In 1876 she passed Cambridge University's external examinations (for women). When her mother died in 1904, Soulsby published an extract of her papers as Home is Best in the same year. Her papers included daily letters sent between them when they were not living together. In 1885, Dorothea Beale took an interest in Soulsby's career and she began to work at Beale's Cheltenham Ladies College which Soulsby acknowledged was excellent training for her career. She became the headmistress of Oxford High School for Girls in 1887 taking over from Matilda Ellen Bishop In her first year she employed Charles Dodgson as a mathematics tutor. He proved a demanding teacher, but he later donated several first editions of his (Lewis Carroll's) Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She introduced chemistry as a subject with the warning that it should not overshadow needlework. Soulsby was a friend of Elizabeth Wordsworth and she was on the council of Wordsworth's Lady Margaret Hall but she came to think that women should not aspire to academic subjects and she was a lone voice in opposing the idea that women in Oxford should be given degrees. Every other Girls' Public Day School Company headmistress was in support of the idea. Brondesbury Manor House in 1910 when Soulsby was head From 1897 to 1915 she led a small school for up to 40 girls at the Manor House, Brondesbury. She supported the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League and believed that women should not have the vote. She valued each pupil and trained each so that they could be as good a wife and mother as her mother had been. By 1915 when she retired these ambitions were no longer inspirational for students. She said that when she needed advice she turned to men. Her 1914 revised version of Principles of Education emphasised bible-reading, prayer and self-discipline.

Biography  Aleksei Stetsky was born in a village called Borovishchina, in the Vyazemsky district of Smolensk the son of an official. He joined a Marxist circle as a schoolboy, and joined the Bolsheviks as a student at a polytechnic in Petrograd (St Petersburg) in 1915. Arrested in 1916, and expelled from Petrograd after two months in prison, he returned illegally on the eve of the February Revolution. During the Russian Civil War, he served as a commander of a regiment fighting against the White Army of General Denikin. In 1921, Stetsky was enrolled in the Institute of Red Professors, where he joined the 'Bukharin School' of young communists intellectuals who looked to Nikolai Bukharin, rather than Joseph Stalin as their leader. A party official from 1923, he was sent to Leningrad in 1925, to assist in defeating the faction there loyal to Stalin's rival, Grigory Zinoviev, as head of the Agitprop brueau for the Leningrad region, and editor-in-chief of the newly created youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. In October 1928, when it became clear that Bukharin had lost his power battle with Stalin, Stetsky went to Stalin's allies Sergo Ordzhonidze and Sergei Kirov that he had severed his relationship with the Bukharin school. He later told Stalin that he was \\"ashamed\\" to have been associated with the Bukharin school. His defection was announced in Pravda in March 1929. He was the only member of the 'Bukharin School' to defect to the Stalin faction. Stetsky was appointed head of the Agitprop of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on 19 November 1929. In April 1932, he was appointed a member of the organising committee of the USSR Writers' Union. In May 1933, he wrote to Stalin denouncing an almanac edited by Maxim Gorky and Leopold Averbakh, which contained a story by the talented writer Nikolai Erdman, which he described as a \\"malicious insult\\" and a \\"counter- revolutionary joke\\". He blamed Averbakh, whom he described as a political intriguer hiding behind Gorky's prestige. Stetsky was head of the Culture Department of the CPSU from 10 February 1934 to 26 April 1938, and a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and of the Orgburo from February 1934 - making him one of the two dozen or so most senior figures in the communist party. In 1934, he was also appointed editor of the magazine Bolshevik. In August 1934, he was one of the main speakers at the Soviet Writers' Congress, in Moscow, in which he claimed that there was creative freedom in the USSR, but at the same time laid down that \\"we cannot portray a single character without showing how this man struggled...Our entire Party, the Party of Lenin and Stalin, has grown up and become hardened in the struggle for socialism... Our artists should let this be felt and understood in their works.\\" Stetsky was arrested on 4 April 1938, and accused of having been part of a secret conspiracy dating back to 1932. He was sentenced to death and shot four months later.

The reports describe over 200,000 suspicious financial transactions valued at over trillion that occurred from 1999 to 2017 across multiple global financial institutions. The documents appear to show that while both the banks and the United States Government had this financial intelligence, they did little to stop activities such as money laundering. The information implicates financial institutions in more than 170 countries who played a role in the facilitation of money laundering and other fraudulent crimes. Journalists around the world have criticized both the banks and the US government, the BBC stating it shows how the \\"world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world\\", and BuzzFeed News claiming the files \\"offer an unprecedented view of global financial corruption, the banks enabling it, and the government agencies that watch as it flourishes.\\" Background FinCEN is a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury that collects and analyses information to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, evasion of economic sanctions and other financial crimes. FinCEN collates suspicious activity reports (SARs), reports required to be filed by financial institutions when they suspect their clients are engaging in financial crime. Unauthorized disclosure of a SAR is a US Federal criminal offense, as it could undermine or hamper ongoing investigations, and threaten the safety of financial institutions and those who file the SARs. SARs are not evidence of a crime, but the FinCEN claims they provide vital information to the investigate crimes. FinCEN collected more than 2 million SARs last year, but their staff has decreased by 10% from 2009 to 2019. BuzzFeed News sources also include that most SARs are not read or taken action upon. While banks are required to file a SAR when they are dealing with suspicious activity, they must still take actions themselves; filing a SAR is not the only thing the bank does to deal with corruption or money laundering. Investigative journalism BuzzFeed News obtained the 2,657 leaked documents, including 2,121 SARs, in 2019 and shared them with the ICIJ. 400 journalists from 88 countries proceeded to investigate the leaks which were brought to the public's attention on 20 September 2020. BuzzFeed News and the ICIJ state that the files flag more than 200,000 transactions dating from 1999 to 2017, worth a total of US$2 trillion dollars. Furthermore, they noted that the findings may not be representative of all SARs, as the files received are less than 0.02% of the more than 12 million SARs that financial institutions filed with FinCEN during this time. The Miami Herald said that the files \\"are the most detailed U.S. Treasury records ever leaked.\\" BuzzFeed News noted that some of the records were gathered as part of U.S. congressional investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections; others were gathered following requests to FinCEN from law enforcement agencies. Findings BuzzFeed News names \\"JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of New York Mellon\\" as involved in money laundering. They also criticise the United States government for not forcing the banks to stop this activity. BuzzFeed and ICIJ have also reported that American Express, Bank of America, Bank of China, Barclays, China Investment Corporation, Citibank, Commerzbank, Danske Bank, First Republic Bank, Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, VEB.RF and Wells Fargo as being involved in the SARs. The ICIJ noted 62% of the leaked filings involved Deutsche Bank, with at least 20% involving addresses in the British Virgin Islands. Prominent individuals highlighted within the leaks include former Donald Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, Iranian-Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab, fugitive businessman Jho Low, and alleged Russian organised crime boss Semion Mogilevich. Other reporting on national connections to the FinCEN Files includes Canada's CBC reporting on HSBC and Australian Broadcasting's coverage. =Africa= It was reported that Angolan businesswoman Isabel dos Santos was flagged for money laundering in 2013. = Asia and Oceania = It has been reported that $174 million of possibly dirty money flowed throughout Australian banks. $123 million is said to have flowed through Macquarie Group and $44 million through Commonwealth Bank. The Indian Express reported that Jindal Steel and Power was flagged by Deutsche Bank for money laundering. The SARs, with additional investigations by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, also provide further details on the scheme employed by Reza Zarrab to evade economic sanctions on Iran, and its links with the Magnitsky tax fraud and other Russian money laundering schemes. In Macau, the Macau News Agency (MNA) reported that 62 transactions involving more than US$68.2 million that flowed to or from four banks in Macau between 2000 and 2017 were flagged as potentially suspicious money-laundering transactions. The banks included Bank of China, Banco Nacional Ultramarino, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau), and HSBC Macau. All these transactions were processed through three American-based financial institutions, that filed SARs with FinCEN by the China Investment Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon and Standard Chartered. In Malaysia, the Malay Mail reported that several international banks had been flagged in numerous suspicious transactions involving fugitive Malaysian businessman Low Taek Jho, involving 103 transactions worth US$2.53 billion. The banks involved included Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, and the Bank of New York Mellon. Jho played a role in being the main person in the laundering of proceeds from the government unit 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Also reported by the Malay Mail, that several leading Malaysian banks and international banks with their Malaysian subsidiaries had been flagged by FinCEN in 23 suspicious transactions with over US$4.88 million entering and US$13.38 million being exited out of the country. the banks included Public Bank Berhad, AmBank, HSBC Bank Malaysia, Alliance Bank Malaysia Berhad, United Overseas Bank, CIMB Bank, and Standard Chartered. The flagged transactions going in and out of these Malaysian banks involved overseas accounts in countries including Afghanistan, Latvia, Poland, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States. In the Philippines, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) reported that the files shows that two Philippine remittance agents Philrem Service Corp. (Philrem) and Werquick Inc. sent more than $1 billion of what were deemed suspicious wires from 2012 to 2016, that were coursed through their foreign currency accounts held at Philippine banks Banco de Oro (BDO), Metrobank and Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC). Philrem and RCBC were involved in the illicit transfer of stolen funds from the Bangladesh Bank in 2016. It was also reported that overseas proceeds from a sextortion scheme that were wired into U.S. banks amounting to more than $400,000 into the accounts of a certain Philippine criminal syndicate led by a certain Charvel Yap Rebagay. His company, Digital Minds and its call centers offices across the Philippines were raided by the Philippine National Police and Interpol in 2014 for sextortion activities. Rebagay is still a wanted fugitive. In Japan, the files also revealed a consulting firm for the Tokyo Olympic 2020 bid committee paid $370,000 to Papa Massata Diack, son of former International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) President and International Olympic Committee (IOC) Lamine Diack that were coursed through Black Tidings, a consulting firm based in Singapore, received a total of $2 million from the bid committee paid into a bank account in the city-state in July and October 2013 and later transferred to Diack's Citibank account. Diack was jailed for corruption and breach of trust by a Paris district court earlier in 2020. It was reported that the Turkish bank Aktif Bank was a financial facilitator for Wirecard and was alleged to have laundered money for the Taliban. The Central Bank of the UAE failed to act on SARs related to evading sanctions in Iran. = Europe = The files showed new details related to the Danske Bank money laundering scandal. ICIJ and Deutsche Welle (DW) report that Germany's Deutsche Bank accounted for 62% of the leaked SARs. DW further notes that Deutsche Bank was responsible for $1.3 trillion worth of suspicious transactions, even after hundreds of millions in fines for violating US sanctions. BuzzFeed News also reported that the files revealed Deutsche Bank was a major source for money laundering for organised crime, terrorists and drug traffickers. In Ireland, The Irish Times reported of a Dublin business called International Overseas Services Group (IOS), an international company services operation, whose Riga, Latvia office helped clients from Russia and the former Soviet Union establish secret accounts with Estonian and Latvian banks, with UK LLP shell companies formed back in the 1990s. The FinCEN documents show 646 of 2100 Scottish and English company SARs are linked to this Irish company, the largest number of any such entity. As for his relationship to money laundering, the company founder likens himself to the innocent seller of a criminal getaway car. The files revealed that US banks have notified their authorities of around $160 million that has gone through the partly state-owned DNB group. The transactions via DNB took place mainly from 2015 to 2017. Some transfers date back to 2008. A report by the BBC suggests that the FinCen Files reveal that the United Kingdom (UK) bank HSBC was involved in numerous illegal money transfers. At the time, HSBC was subject to a deferred prosecution agreement for the laundering of $881 million on behalf of the Sinaloa and Norte del Valle cartels. The files also describe how Barclays Bank laundered money on behalf of Arkady Rotenberg, a close associate of Vladimir Putin, who is under sanctions for his involvement in the Ukrainian crisis. The BBC further notes that the UK is judged a \\"higher risk jurisdiction\\" due to the number of the country's companies appearing in SARs. The Times of Malta reported that ‚Ç¨647m worth of transfers by Afton into Electrogas were flagged as suspicious. =North and South America= It was reported that the Argentinian company Vicentin was flagged for money laundering. Javier Mascherano was reportedly flagged for money laundering for more than $1 million in transactions by his British Virgin Islands-registered company, Alenda Investments Ltd. The FinCEN Files implicate former Mexican president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto in money laundering. The files revealed that Group Grand Limited was controlled by Alex Saab and √Ålvaro Pulido. NBC News reported that North Korea carried out a money laundering scheme in the US using shell companies and help from Chinese firms to launder money through US banks. The files reported that BNY Melon processed $137m for entities related to Onecoin. Responses BuzzFeed News contacted the named banks for responses to the allegations. American Express and Bank of China did not respond; Bank of America and First Republic Bank declined to comment. Even as the worldwide group of journalists was preparing their reporting of the FinCEN Files, FinCEN announced on 16 September 2020 that they would be overhauling their money laundering programs. Deutsche Bank commented on the FinCEN investigation, explaining that the transactions in the FinCEN file leaks were prior to 2016, and \\"acknowledged past weaknesses in our control environment... we learnt from our mistakes, systematically tackled the issues and made changes to our business perimeter, our controls, and our personnel.\\" They invested \\"$1 billion in improved controls, trainings and operational processes, and have increased our anti-financial crime team to over 1,500 people.\\" and make the claim that they \\"are a different bank now.\\" They followed their response up with an additional statement, restating their commitment to ensuring fraud doesn't occur and saying \\"To the extent that information referenced by the ICIJ is derived from SARs, this is information that is pro-actively identified and submitted by banks to governments pursuant to the law. SARs are alerts of potential issues, not proven facts.‚Äù Standard Charter responded to these accusations, claiming \\"we take our responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously.\\" They state that they meet their obligations to law enforcement, and say that \\"the responsibility of banks is to build effective screening and monitoring systems and we work closely with regulators and law enforcement to bring perpetrators to justice.\\" Valdis Dombrovskis defended his record on Money Laundering saying in a statement to the ICIJ \\"‚ÄúDuring my time as prime minister of Latvia between 2008 and 2014, in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, my governments oversaw important reforms ‚Ä¶ to tackle money laundering and close loopholes...Progress made was acknowledged by [European Union] institutions at the time.‚Äù FinCEN condemned the leak, saying that it could impact on US national security, compromise investigations, and threaten the safety of institutions and individuals who file FinCEN reports. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both called for reform amidst the news. Senator Warren pushed for punishments when banks are caught breaking the law and called for the passage of her \\"Ending Too Big to Jail Act\\" bill. Bernie Sanders stated that the laundering practices were \\"just some of the routine business practices on Wall Street\\" and that the \\"business model of Wall Street is fraud.\\" Linda A. Lacewell the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, said in an opinion piece that ‚ÄúIndividual bankers are rarely held accountable, so money laundering becomes a source of profits and bank fines become a cost of doing business, when the profits exceed the fines, the business choice is easily corrupted.‚Äù  Impact  On 21 September 2020 numerous bank stocks plunged as a result of the leaks. HSBC shares dropped to lowest levels in 25 years.

Her poetic works give voice to her activism set on empowering black women and encouraging them to establish their place in history. Her poem Rotundamente negra (Absolutely Black, 1994) has become a symbol for women in the Afro-descendant women's movements in Latin American for its self-affirming pro-black message. Early life and education Shirley Campbell Barr was born in 1965 in San Jos√©, Costa Rica to Shirley Barr Aird and Luis Campbell Patterson. She grew up in a family of two brothers and five sisters, including Epsy Campbell Barr, vice president of Costa Rica. Both of her grandmothers arrived in Costa Rica from Jamaica and from childhood, Campbell spoke Jamaican English. She attended the arts school, Conservatorio de Castella, where she first studied poetry under Ronald Bonilla. She recognized that her writing could be used as an instrument to foster change in the perceptions that people of African descent had of themselves and their place in society. While at the conservatory, she began to act in plays and study literature. She attended the University of Costa Rica, earning a degree in anthropology in 1993. She married fellow Costa Rican, Harold Robinson Davis, and because of his work moved to Zimbabwe in 1994. She took post graduate courses in African history and feminism at the University of Zimbabwe of Harare, while living there for two years. Career In 1996, Campbell moved back to Central America and spent three years teaching in El Salvador, and working as an activist with the Garifuna people in Honduras, where she lived briefly but left because of Hurricane Mitch. After moving to Jamaica for a time, she lived in the United States, azil , and Panama, building a broad knowledge of the ways in which the African diaspora have been impacted by globalization. Completing her master's degree in international cooperation and development in 2004 at the Catholic University of Santa Mar√≠a in Arequipa, Peru, Campbell then studied and completed her training at the Fundaci√≥n Cultural y Estudios Sociales (Cultural and Social Studies Foundation) in Valencia, Spain. In talking about her writing career, Campbell has said that her goal is to empower black women and allow them to see themselves reflected in society, since they have been historically omitted from representation in academia, media, power structures, and even toys. She considers herself an activist who gives voice to her cause through her writing. Her work has been widely distributed in Latin America and the Caribbean and translated into English, French, and Portuguese. Her first published book, Naciendo (Being Born, 1988) deals with the discovering one's origins and placing them in a historical and cultural context. Her second book, Rotundamente negra (Absolutely Black, 1994), is an iconic work which is widely known by black women from the Caribbean and throughout the Americas. It has become an anthem of sorts for women who participate in the network of Afro-descendant women's groups which have grown exponentially since the 1990s. The first lines of the poem are an unapologetic and self-affirming pro-black statement: \\"Me niego rotundamente/ a negar mi voz/ mi sangre y mi piel\\" [I absolutely refuse / to deny my voice,/ my blood and my skin]. Overall, the work does not objectify or sexualize black women's bodies, but validates Campbell's own perception of her appearance from her own aesthetic sense. In addition to writing, Campbell participates in educational events worldwide in an effort to encourage black women to write their own stories. She has presented essays like Asumiendo responsabilidad por la palabra (Taking Responsibility for the Word) at events like a regional seminar for black women hosted by the United Nations Development Programme in Montevideo, Uruguay in 2009. She has been an invited speaker at the First Meeting of Afro-descendant Writers hosted in 2019 by the University of Costa Rica, and for the exhibition Ancestralidad, √Åfrica en Nosotros (Ancestry, Africa in Us) held at The Museum of the Institute for Research and Dissemination of Black Cultures in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the same year. \\"Her poems have been incorporated into various popular performances in Latin America, such as popular radio soap operas, plays, songs, choral poetry, etc. in Argentina, Spain, Colombia, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, among others\\".

It is currently approaching Earth and its trajectory indicates the geocentric orbital eccentricity was less than 1 by 15 October 2020, and will become temporarily captured in November when it enters Earth's Hill sphere. It will enter via the outer Lagrange point and exit via Lagrange point . During its geocentric orbit around Earth, 2020 SO will make a close approach to Earth on 1 December 2020 at a nominal perigee distance of approximately . It will also make another close approach around 2 February 2021, at a nominal perigee distance of approximately . By February 2021 the time of closest approach to Earth has an uncertainty of ¬±1 days. Paul Chodas of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory suspects 2020 SO of being the Surveyor 2 Centaur rocket booster, launched on 20 September 1966. The Earth-like orbit and low relative velocity suggest a possible artificial object. Spectroscopy may help determine if it is covered in titanium dioxide paint. Around the time of closest approach on 1 December 2020, the object will only brighten to about apparent magnitude 14.1, and will require a telescope with roughly a 150mm (6\\") objective lens to be seen visually. At the time of its discovery, 2020 SO had unremarkable motion typical of a main-belt asteroid. However, the four observations that Pan- STARRS obtained over the course of 1.4 hours showed non-linear motion due to the rotation of the observer around Earth's axis, which is a signature of a nearby object. { class=wikitable style=\\"font-size: 0.9em;\\" +Orbital Elements for May and December 2020 - valign=top !Parameter !Epoch !

The border is 1,158 km (720 m) in length and runs from the tripoint with Laos in the north to Gulf of Thailand in the south. Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Laos and then proceeds overland to the south, occasionally utilising rivers such as the Tonl√© San. It then turns in a broad arc to the south-west, except for the Cambodian protrusion known as the Parrot's Beak, running mostly overland but also at times using rivers such as the V√†m C·ªè Dong and the Saigon. After cutting across the Mekong delta it continues southwestwards, terminating at the Gulf of Thailand just west of H√† Ti√™n. The maritime boundary forms a loop, thus leaving the island of Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc in Vietnam despite it being closer to the Cambodia shore. History A boundary pillar at M√¥c B√†i Vietnamese people gradually migrated from northern Vietnam southwards during the 10th - 18th centuries, eventually bringing them into contact with the Khmer kingdom. Relations were often tense, with Vietnam frequently invading Cambodian lands; in 1857 a joint Siamese-Vietnamese protectorate was established over Cambodia. From the 1860s France began establishing a presence in the region, initially in modern Cambodia and Vietnam, and the colony of French Indochina was created in 1887, also including Laos. A partial boundary between Cambodia and Cochinchina (southern Vietnam) in its southernmost section by the Gulf coast was drawn by the French in 1868-69 and then ratified in 1870. This boundary was then modified slightly in 1873. In 1904 ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk was transferred from Laos to Annam (central Vietnam) and Stung Treng province transferred from Laos to Cambodia, with the rest of the Cambodia-Vietnam boundary as far north as the Srepok River then being delimited. Various small adjustments were made to the alignment after this in the years 1914, 1932, 1933, 1935 and 1936. In 1939 Jules Br√©vi√©, Governor- General of French Indochina, divided the islands in the Gulf of Thailand on a purely administrative basis with the so-called 'Br√©vi√© line', however a scheudled allocation of the islands between Cambodia and Vietnam never took place. In 1942 another small adjustment to the frontier was made in the vicinity of the Bassac River. In 1954 both Cambodia and Vietnam gained full independence, however the latter was split into a Communist North and a capitalist South, with Cambodia bordering South Vietnam only. The border remained undemarcated and numerous areas, as well as the Gulf islands, remained in dispute. Furthermore, Khmer nationalists laid claim to much of the Mekong delta area of southern Vietnam (called 'Kampuchea Krom'), based on the fact that historically these were Khmer lands. During the Vietnam War the border was crossed by Viet Cong supply lines, most notably the southern stretch of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, causing it to be heavily bombed by American forces. In return for tolerating the Viet Cong presence along the border, Cambodia attempted to extract territorial concessions, though with little success. In 1975 the nationalist-Communist Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and made gaining some or all of Kampuchea Krom a priority. A brief Khmer invasion occurring the day after Saigon fell to North Vietnam was repulsed, and border discussions then took place from 1976 to 1977. With relations deteriorating numerous skirmishes occurred along the border, with Vietnam eventually invading Cambodia in 1978 and ousting the Khmer Rouge. Discussions on the border thereafter reconvened in 1983, with both sides in 1985 pledging to recognise the border as it was at independence. Discussions continued into the early 1990s. A treaty was signed in 2005, followed by on-the-ground demarcation, which was completed in 2012.

Melnyk is also the editor in chief of the journal Worldviews on Evidence Based Nursing. Early life and education Melnyk was born on March 20, 1957. Growing up in Republic, Pennsylvania, she attended Redstone Township High School and Brownsville Area High School while her brother Fred Mazurek was recruited to play professional football. At the age of 15, Melnyk's mother was diagnosed with high blood pressure and suffered a stroke in front of her in their home. As a result, Melnyk began experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but found a lack of resources through her family physcians. Within the next four years, various other members of her family died including her cousin, grandmother, and father. Melynk earned her Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree from West Virginia University before returning to her hometown state and attending the University of Pittsburgh for her Master of Science in Nursing degree and pediatric nurse practitioner certification. While practising at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Melynk delivered her first child who experienced complications at birth. She said it was hard for her to continue working in the pediatric unit after this and she accepted a teaching position in the diploma program at UPMC Shadyside Hospital. Following this, Melynk enrolled at the University of Rochester for a PhD in clinical research and her post-masters certificate as a psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. She divorced her first husband while interviewing for their graduate school. Career Upon completing her PhD Melnyk re-married and interviewed at five universities, but chose to stay at the University of Rochester. Shortly thereafter, she was appointed a professor and associate dean for research and director of the Center for Research & Evidenced-Based Practice and Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Program at the University of Rochester's School of Nursing.

As a result, she was the recipient of the 2006 Health Care Hero Innovator of the Year award which \\"honors someone who breaks ground in the health care field by developing or implementing new technology, treatments, or programs with wide applications.\\" During her tenure at ASU, Melnyk was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing and the National Academies of Practice while also sitting on the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

On September 15, 2011, Melnyk left ASU to accept a position as Ohio State University's (OSU) dean of the College of Nursing and associate vice president for Health Promotion and chief wellness officer. She was OSU's first chief wellness officer and the first at any United States university. Upon arriving at OSU, she formed the One University Health & Wellness Council, aimed at gathering leaders in health and wellness at the university to improve on the school's culture of wellness. As a result of her accomplishments in intervention research, evidence-based practice, and child and adolescent mental health, she was awarded the 2012 Midwest Nursing Research Society (MNRS) Senior Scientist Award. She continued her research into the COPE program and published data in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine which found that students who exercised for 15 to 20 minutes daily were less likely to gain significant weight than those who attended traditional health classes. This was because the students who exercised were taught cognitive techniques to reduce stress and anxiety. Melnyk's continued advocacy for evidence-based practices were further recognized in 2013 when her edited book Intervention Research: Designing, Conducting, Analyzing, and Funding received the American Journal of Nursing Book of the Year award for nursing research. She also accepted an appointment to the editor of Worldviews on Evidence Based Nursing, and received an election to the National Institute of Medicine. Based on data including awards, Top 10 rankings, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, and National Council Lincensure Examination (NCLEX) passing percentage, Melnyk was named one of 30 most influential nursing deans in 2015. The following year, the third edition of Melnyk's book Evidence-Based Practice in Nursing and Healthcare: A Guide to Best Practice received the 2016 Book of the Year Award from American Journal of Nursing. One of the judges reviewing her book wrote: \\"This comprehensive text provides a strong foundation for implementing and sustaining EBP in clinical decision making for all levels of nurses, from undergraduate nursing students to doctors of nursing practice and seasoned practitioners. Even beginner students will find the information interesting and will be encouraged to actively engage in EBP to improve patient outcomes.\\" Melnyk also led an evidence-based practices study examining why hospitals that attempt to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs simultaneously often fail. To reach this conclusion, her research team surveyed 276 chief nurse executives across the United States to collect data on how evidence-based practice ranks as a priority in their institutions. In response, more than half reported that it is had limited practised in their organization. As a leader at OSU's College of Nursing, Melnyk increased their enrollment and hiring of faculty members and rose their school ranking in the U.S. News & World Report. In recognition of her efforts, she was promoted to vice president for health promotion and reappointed dean through 2022. Following her promotion, Melnyk receives the 2017 Sharp Cutting Edge Award from the American Association of Nurse Practitioners for having shown \\"leadership through innovative services, technologies or advocacy activities that advanced NP practise and patient care on a national level.\\" Likewise, she was also the recipient of the American Organization of Nurse Executives Foundation 2017 Nurse Researcher Award in recognition of \\"a nurse researcher who has made significant contributions to nursing research and is recognized by the broader nursing community as an outstanding nurse researcher.\\" She continued to study the quality of health care practices across the nation in 2017 by receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities for a study entitled, Healthy Lifestyle Intervention for High-Risk Minority Pregnant Women: A Randomized Controlled Trial. The aim of the study was to test a cognitive behavioural skills building prenatal care intervention program for pregnant minority women experiencing emotional distress. In 2018, Melnyk received numerous accolades from the medical and nursing community including the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses 2018 Pioneering Spirit Award for her significant contributions that influenced high-acuity and critical care nursing. She was also appointed to sit on the Board of Directors for the National Forum for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention. The following year, Melnyk was awarded her third ‚ÄúAcademy Edge Runner‚Äù Honor from American Academy of Nursing for her successful cognitive-behavioral skills building intervention programs. During the COVID-19 pandemic in North America, Melnyk established a partnership between OSU's College of Nursing and Trusted Health, a career platform for nurses. The goal of the partnership was to promote mental health and well- being for travel nurses on the front lines. She also sat as vice chair of the Safe Campus and Scientific Advisory Subgroup of the COVID-19 Transition Task Force and encouraged students to wear face masks.

The band played music usually characterised as ragtime, or early jazz, and was one of the first small groups of African-American musicians to perform in Britain and Europe. They were an offshoot of an earlier ensemble, the Versatile Entertainers Quintet. Biography The Versatile Entertainers Quintet are first mentioned in May 1910, performing at James Reese Europe's Clef Club in Harlem, New York City, on a bill that also included dancers Irene and Vernon Castle. In 1913, three members of the Quintet, banjo player Anthony Tuck (born in Danville, Virginia, 1879- after 1936), pianist Charles Wenzel Mills (born in Quincy, Illinois, 1884-1946), and drummer Charles Wesley Johnson (born in Louisville, Kentucky, 1885-?), Michael Brocken, Jeff Daniels, Gordon Stretton, Black British Transoceanic Jazz Pioneer: A New Jazz Chronicle, Rowman & Littlefield, 2018, p.145 accompanied Irene and Vernon Castle on a tour of Europe. Biography by arwulf arwulf, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 20 September 2020 In Europe, the trio of Mills, Tuck and Johnson collaborated with multi-instrumentalist Gus Haston (Augustus Adolphus Haston, born in St Louis, Missouri, 1880-1967) to form the Versatile Four. Haston had studied music in Toronto, toured Europe in 1905 as a mandolin player in Ernest Hogan's band, the Memphis Students, and settled in London. The Versatile Four toured in Britain, playing as music hall entertainers, and at some venues associated with entertainer Gordon Stretton, English-born but of mixed Jamaican and Irish heritage. They also toured in Europe, but returned to the United States after the start of the First World War. After finding little work in the U.S., they returned to London in 1915, and remained for some ten years, playing at the London Pavilion Theatre, Murray's Cabaret Club in Soho, and elsewhere. Their syncopated music became popular, and they became a favorite of the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII.Brocken, Daniels, p.112 In February 1916, they made their first recordings, including a version of Wilbur Sweatman's \\"Down Home Rag\\" released on the \\"His Master's Voice\\" label. The band comprised Haston and Tuck on banjolins, Mills on piano, and Johnson on snare drum and woodblock. Sweatman's biographer Mark Berresford wrote that, led by Haston, they \\"turn in an extremely lively, nay rowdy, performance... in a style that is a fascinating amalgam of country string band and Clef Club banjo orchestra, complete with shouted encouragements to both the imaginary dancers and to one another, and overzealous percussion from drummer Charlie Johnson. The wildness and abandon of the performance is capped by the shouted exclamation by Gus Haston of 'Howww's that?' after the final cymbal crash\\".

In 1919, the trio recorded for the Edison Bell Winner label, and on some recordings the following year added a second saxophone, possibly Edmund Jenkins. They recorded as the Diplomat Orchestra in 1921, and also accompanied Dewey Wineglass' Dancing Demons, a tap-dancing troupe. They made their final recordings in England in 1923, and returned to the U.S. in 1926. Mills left the band, to be replaced by Julius Maceo Covington, but the group disbanded in early 1927. Covington died in Paris soon afterwards. Gus Haston made some recordings as a vocalist for the Victor label in 1931. \\"Gus Haston\\", Discography of American Historical Recordings.

History During the time of the Second Spanish Republic, the Spanish state questioned the role of co-prince of the bishop of La Seu d'Urgell, Just√≠ Guitart i Vilardeb√≥. The same situation was repeated as during the French Revolution. Spain did not conceive that one of its citizens had the sovereignty of another state. The Spanish and Catalan press began to criticize the role of co-prince, exclaiming that it was possible that the Andorran people had no sovereignty and would be subject to two feudal princes. From Catalunya, the Catalanist and anarcho-syndicalist atmosphere greatly influenced Andorran immigrants. In 1933, the Joves Andorrans (a trade union related to the CNT-FAI) occupied the General Council, demanding universal suffrage for Andorran citizens - igniting the Andorran Revolution, which saw the General Council elected with universal male suffrage and the implementation of civil liberties. The Spanish republic denied the bishop the right to be co-prince of Andorra, with annexationist intentions behind it. The anticlericalism of the Second Republic was very offensive to the Catholic Church which led to the bishop joining the nationalists When the Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936 the bishop went into exile in San Remo. He was in the Aran Valley when he learned of the military coup. On the night of his escape, a group of anarchists went to wake him up by standing under the window where he was staying to sing the Internationale with their fists raised. Before leaving, he left the episcopal delegation in the hands of Miquel Mateu. Once in San Remo, the nationalists convinced him to sign the collective letter of the bishops of 1937. It was a manifesto in which the Catholic Church supported fascism. = Refugees and border control = With the outbreak of the revolution in Catalunya, libertarian communism was proclaimed in Urgell. The atmosphere became radicalized and many people from Urgell temporarily fled to Andorra, thinking that the coup would fail like the Sanjurjada. At first the country hosted nationalists that had fled from republican positions in Catalunya. Towards the end of the conflict, a second wave of refugees fled to Andorra, these were anarchists, republicans and socialists, fleeing from the nationalist offensive. Andorra welcomed everyone, on both sides of the conflict. The FAI was even installed on the Andorra‚ÄìCatalunya border, where they began to take control of smuggling operations. Puigcerd√† was also the border with the second-most escapes. = FHASA workers and Andorrans before the war = FHASA workers were affiliated with the CNT and the FAI, they agitated in Andorra and invited their anarchist friends to stay in the country too. Once in Andorra, they took the opportunity to register the names of the nationalists who had taken refuge and then denounced them. The FHASA's director Miquel Mateu was, on the other hand, a declared fascist and helped the nationalists as best he could. In Sant Juli√† de L√≤ria the population joined the fascist side, where Andorra la Vella and Escaldes-Engordany became anarchist refuges. Three bars of the time stand out in particular: the Hotel Mirador and the Casino d‚ÄôEscaldes (republicans) and the Bar de Burgos (fascists). The lower parishes were usually more akin to the trends circulating in Castile or Catalunya while the higher ones followed the French temperament. The constant movement of people through Andorra made it impossible to take a neutral position and its people opted for one side or the other. In Sant Juli√† the border was blocked during the war to prevent anarchists from entering the country. Border control was so strict that even a valid pass or passport did not guarantee escape or entry into Andorra. The Andorran youth largely sympathized with the republican cause and wanted to proclaim an Independent Republic of Andorra. The older generations, on the other hand, were largely followers of fascism and hoped that it would establish \\"order\\" in Andorra. There were also Andorrans who helped the refugees on both sides by giving them food and sleep. The two sides often settled their differences by shooting at each other in the mountains, which provided anonymity from the Andorran authorities. Within the country republicans and nationalists were waging small-scale warfare with real weapons. An improvised hospital had to be set up at FHASA to manage the arrival of all those refugees who had been shot during their entrance into Andorra.  The intervention of the gendarmerie  According to the Andorran authorities, the group that caused the most instability was the FHASA workers, who gathered weapons for a republican revolution in the country. The plan was to take advantage of the fact that during the winter the port on the French side was blocked. But the attempt failed after the General Council approved French intervention by a majority. Although he did not intervene in Spain, the French co-prince Albert Lebrun did intervene in Andorra. The communes convened parish meetings which rejected the intervention and decided on what was to be done about it. The village itself decided to mount a troop of men with the help of the communes to prevent the gendarmes from passing beyond the border of the Pas de la Casa. Despite this, General Ren√© Baulard once again occupied the country. Lists of anarchist and nationalist in Andorra were drawn up. After the occupation, many anarchists had to ask the gendarmerie for permission to stay. Spaniards, Basques, Catalans or Galicians who crossed the border thereafter were sent to French concentration camps. The turn to the right caused by the war caused many political milestones to be revoked. Universal male suffrage was suspended and freedom of expression was revoked. People were afraid to talk openly about the war or about Francoism. With the war, escape networks were created that helped Holocaust survivors, among others, to leave Europe or take refuge in isolated countries, such as Andorra. Antoni Forn√© i Jou, a member of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification, helped to organize the Andorran escape network.

Work  = Major exhibitions = Kuoni curated the exhibition that is presented in the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Gallery at the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center at Parsons. This exhibition took the form of a stage set up for debate. The stage consisted of four distinct structures that each feature analytical as well as generative components. The first structure was a central platform, created by Liam Gillick. The first phase consists of lectures, performances, solution-driven workshops, and panels. The second phase of the exhibition consisted of interpretative materials that put the exhibition into context and creating little brands. There would be stickers, posters, handouts, and a gallery guide at the second part of the exhibition. The third phase of the exhibition consisted of workshops inserted into existing classes at Parsons. The workshops constituted specific challenges and force the participants to come up with immediate solutions. The fourth phase of the exhibition consisted of public lectures and panels that reiterated the subject. Kuoni believes that while the students are creating their own exhibitions they are learning more about the often overlooked past. = Public collections = Kuoni was one of the founding members of REPOhistory, and the projects that are produced from them are primarily located in public spaces. Most of their projects are projected in New York City and Atlanta, Georgia. REPOhistory used metal street signs, mass media, and maps to distribute their information. = Awards and nominations = Kuoni is the recipient of a 2014 Andy Warhol Foundation Curatorial Fellowship.

Alongside his academic research, Jones is a popular science communicator and regularly provides expert commentary on issues related to economics and public policy. During the COVID-19 pandemic he investigated the disproportionate impact of coronavirus disease on communities of color, and delivered evidence on his findings before the United States House Committee on the Budget.  Early life and education  As a high school student, Jones was selected as a Du Bois Scholar. He studied public policy at Stanford University, where he minored in African-American studies. He moved to the University of California, Berkeley for his graduate studies, where he specialized in economics and worked alongside Emmanuel Saez. After earning his doctoral degree, Jones returned to Stanford, joining the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research as a Searle Freedom Trust Postdoctoral Scholar. During this time he held an affiliate research position at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison Center for Financial Stability.  Research and career  After completing his postdoctoral fellowship in 2010, Jones joined the faculty at the Harris School of Public Policy Studies. He holds a Faculty Research Fellowship at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Jones specialises in three areas of economics; including public finance, government taxation and behavioural taxation. Jones' early work considered income taxes and household finance in low-income households. He called for a revamping of the earned income tax credit, learning from the Working Tax Credit scheme in the United Kingdom and delivering payments in a more timely manner. Jones has also investigated the employment decisions of older Americans, and evaluated the impact of the Social Security Annual Earnings Test (AET). The AET reduces the benefits of claimants in proportion to the amount of money they earn in excess of a certain amount. Harris previously served on the Chicago Resilient Families Task Force, which was funded by the Economic Security Project, which proposed cash transfer to low-income families. The program was based on Jones' research which had identified that cash transfers can immediately improve well being, and do not result in people leaving the workforce. As a loyal fan of college sports, Jones became interested in the economics of student athletes, and has argued that they should be both paid and unionized. Jones has investigated the racial wealth gap in the United States, showing that not only do Black households have less wealth than their white counterparts, but they are more likely to be unemployed and less likely to access unemployment benefits. Jones is part of the Innovations for Poverty Action research program that looks at ways to support teachers who were struggling with their finances. Teacher turnover is high in the United States, particularly in schools that serve low- income families, and it may be related to their extortionate student loan debt. Federal loan forgiveness programs may offer some respite, but they are not frequently used, and Jones wondered whether personalized interventions might help. In 2020, Jones was awarded an National Institute for Health Care Management research award to investigate workplace wellness program. He is principal investigator of the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, a randomized controlled trial that looks to evaluate the effects of financial incentives on employee participation in workplace wellness programs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jones investigated why communities of color were the hardest hit. He showed that persistent racial inequality meant that shocks to income affected Black and hispanic households more strongly than white ones. In June 2020 Jones delivered evidence before the United States House Committee on the Budget where he explained that the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States would disproportionately impact those with low levels of financial stability. As part of the hearing Jones made the statement ‚Äúwhile it may seem that the current crisis calls on all of us to make sacrifices, not all households have to tighten their belts equally,‚Äù. Jones has called for more diversity within economics, particularly increasing the representation of Black economists. He serves on the Board of Directors of the W. E. B. Du Bois Scholars Institute, which looks to support high school students from communities who have historically experienced barriers to opportunity.  Personal life  Jones is married to Eve Ewing, an American poet and visual artist.

Writing Guyton was inspired to write the song when she met a young woman who had just arrived in Nashville with the intention to pursue a career in country music. She asked Guyton what she had to look forward to about following her dream and Guyton realized that she didn't have a single good thing to tell her. Additionally, while attending a Grammy party in L.A., Guyton remembers looking over at a table of female artists and wondering what they had to go through to achieve success in the male-dominated music industry. Of these two events, Guyton explained that ‚ÄúI remember thinking to myself, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt own ourselves‚Äô. We are the change in these people's pocketbooks, and we are sacrificing everything for this.‚Äù Following the Grammys, Guyton flew back to Nashville for a songwriting session with Canadian artists Victoria Banks, Emma-Lee and Karen Kosowski. The four women started sharing stories of the difficulties they've experienced as women in both the music industry and the wider world which eventually resulted in the writing of \\"What Are You Gonna Tell Her?\\" Of the song, Banks stated that ‚ÄúI remember thinking ‚ÄòOh man, radio is never going to play that.‚Äô Then I was like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care, because it‚Äôs more important to say it.‚Äù After completing the song, Guyton considered whether this was the end of her career in country music as she did not believe a song so raw would be accepted and, after ten years in Nashville, she still struggled to understand what the genre wanted her to be. Speaking on the song, Guyton explained ‚ÄúI was trying so hard to fit into the stereotype of what country music is, that I forgot why I fell in love with country music. We‚Äôve been in this period where it‚Äôs all about having a good time and drinking and girls. It‚Äôs so heavily male-dominated that I don‚Äôt hear myself, and I don‚Äôt see myself within it anymore. Country music is three chords and the truth. So I wrote my truth.‚Äù Content Lyrically, the song is a ballad about gender discrimination, criticizing the injustices brought upon young women, people of color and children with big dreams. The chorus asks four simple yet devastating questions: \\"What are you gonna tell her when she‚Äôs wrong?/Will you just shrug and say it‚Äôs been that way all along?/What are you gonna tell her when she figures out/That all this time you built her up just so the world can let her down? What are you gonna tell her\\". Live Performances Guyton performed the song at the Country Radio Seminar in February 2020, where she received a standing ovation. Reviewers called the song \\"powerful and \\"transcendent\\", with Guyton's co-writer Victoria Banks tweeting ‚ÄúI'm still shaking. We wrote this three weeks ago from the gut. Today I watched [Guyton] bring the Ryman full of radio execs to their feet with it. God bless her for being brave enough. It was like she reached up and grabbed a giant elephant that we know is in the room, then pulled it down and showed it to everyone.‚Äù On September 16, 2020, Guyton performed \\"What Are You Gonna Tell Her?\\" on stage at the Grand Ole Opry House as part of the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards with host Keith Urban backing her on piano. Guyton's performance made history as the first black woman to perform her own song solo at the ACM Awards (Rhianna previously dueted with Jennifer Nettles in 2011 and Valerie June appeared alongside Eric Church in 2013).

On 17 July 1943, Ro-35 departed Kure, Japan, bound for Truk. During her voyage, she was reassigned to the 1st Submarine Unit in the 6th Fleet on 20 July 1943\\\\.

The border, which divides the island of New Guinea in half, consists of two straight north-south lines connected by a short section running along the Fly river, totalling 824 km (512 m). Description The border starts in the north at northern coast of New Guinea, immediately west of the Papuan village of Wutung and Mount Bougainville. It then proceeds in a straight vertical line to the south along the 140th meridian east, cutting across the Oenake Range, the Kohari Hills, the Bewani Mountains, the Border Mountains and the Central Highlands. Upon reaching the Fly River it then follows this in a C-shaped curve, before continuing in a N-S line at 140¬∫ 01'10\\" meridian east, cutting across the Kai Lagoon, down to the estuary of the Bensbach River with the Torres Strait on the southern coast of New Guinea. History The colonial partition of New Guinea from 1884 to 1919 The Netherlands began colonising the area of modern Indonesia (then called the Dutch East Indies) in the 17th century, and extended their rule eastwards. In 1828 they claimedthe north-west coast of New Guinea as far as the 140th meridian east in 1828, as part of the traditional lands of the Sultan of Tidore. In 1884 the north-eastern quarter of New Guinea was claimed by Germany and the south-eastern quarter by Britain, with the two agreeing a border between their respective territories the following year. In 1895 Britain and the Netherlands signed a border treaty which delimited their common boundary on the island at its current location. British New Guinea was renamed the Territory of Papua in 1905 and given to Australia the following year. Following the defeat of Germany in the First World War it was stripped of its colonies, with German New Guinea given to Britain in 1920 and then united with Papua in 1949 as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Indonesia gained independence in 1949, however Dutch New Guinea was kept under Dutch rule owing to its unique character, sparking a dispute with Indonesia, which claimed the territory as 'Irian Jaya'. The territory was later transferred to Indonesia in 1963, and West Papuans opposed to Indonesian rule than began an insurgency that continues today. In 1973 the eastern half of the island was renamed Papua New Guinea and gained independence in 1975. The border was based on an Australian-Indonesia treaty signed on 13 February 1973 which fixed the border at its current position. Tensions between Indonesia and PNG grew, as the ongoing West Papuan conflict destabilised the border region, causing flows of refugees and cross-border incursions by Indonesia's military. In 1986 a friendship treaty between the two countries was signed, by which both sides agreed to settle any issues they had peacefully. The treaty was renewed in 1990.

Toll. The book is a narrative history of the opening phase of the Pacific War, which took place in the eastern Pacific between the Allies and the Empire of Japan. It was published by W. W. Norton & Company in 2011 (hardcover and Kindle) and 2012 (paperback) and was released as an audiobook narrated by Grover Gardner by Audible Studios in 2011. The following volume in the trilogy, The Conquering Tide: War in the Pacific Islands, 1942-1944, was published in 2014; the final volume in the trilogy, Twilight of the Gods: War in the Western Pacific, 1944-1945, was published in 2020. Synopsis Pacific Crucible covers the period from December 1941 to June 1942, a time frame that starts with the successful Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor and ends with the dramatic Japanese defeat at the Battle of Midway. In between the author weaves into the story chapter length biographies of key well known individuals such as Admirals Chester W. Nimitz and Ernest King, along with lesser known individuals such as Joseph Rochefort and Thomas Dyer while telling the story of Station Hypo, the code breaking team they led. Toll recounts the stunning Japanese blitzkrieg in the South Pacific that followed Pearl Harbor, the tentative small-scale clashes between the United States and Japan that followed, and the Battle of the Coral Sea, which set the stage for the Japanese defeat at Midway. The book primarily tells the story from the American point of view, but the author does not leave out details about the Japanese leadership, goals, strategy, and tactics or those of the American allies such as Britain and Australia. Chapters 3 and 4 provide the reader with a background of recent Japanese history, the circumstances and American interest surrounding the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the military culture and ArmyNavy rivalry that helped lead Japan into conflict with its neighbors. Toll provides another mini-biography of Isoroku Yamamoto, the Admiral that planned and led the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Midway. The book pays particular attention to the often contentious relationship between the military leadership of the United States and Britain and their often conflicting viewpoints. Today, knowing the outcome of the war, it's easy not to understand the uncertainties of 194142; Toll does an excellent job of conveying to the reader the real-life drama and uncertainty of the time and events he describes. The book concludes with the drama of the battle of Midway and why it became a turning point in the Pacific war. Michael Beschloss writes, \\"As Toll rightly asserts in his book's final pages, Midway exposed a central tension that would govern the remaining three years of the Pacific conflict: \\"Japan's transcendent 'fighting spirit' was to be pitted against America's overwhelming industrial-military might.\\" Pacific Crucible takes the reader through the course of events that led to the eclipse of the battleship with the age of the aircraft carrier. Toll traces the development of naval war strategy from the thinking of Alfred Thayer Mahan in the late 19th century, through the development of the war plans for the Pacific region in both the United States and Japan between the World Wars, up to the opening stages of World War II. Toll then describes how events led military leaders in the United States, Britain, and Japan to reassess the role of battleships, large fleet encounters, and most importantly the role of airpower in naval conflicts. Finally, Toll reveals how the Japanese completely underestimated American resolve to fight a long war in the Pacific. In writing about Japanese attitudes in the opening phase of the war, Toll writes, \\"\\"The Japanese people were rapidly succumbing to what would later be called shoribyo, or \\"victory disease\\"‚Äî a faith that Japan was invincible, and could afford to treat its enemies with contempt. Its symptoms were overconfidence, a failure to weigh risks properly, and a basic misunderstanding of the enemy.\\"\\" He demonstrates how the rapid events of the first six months of the war led to the slow war of attrition that followed in the next three years, which ultimately provided the United States the time it needed to develop the industrial, technical, and scientific means to defeat Japan. Reception Writing in the New York Times about Toll's skill at crafting compelling narratives with interesting mini- biographies, Michael Beschloss writes, \\"Toll has an affinity for the detailed narrative of military conflict and for capsule portraiture of key personalities both high-ranking and low. Here, his effort to provide historical recognition where it is due extends to the subject of the Pacific War itself, which ‚Äî even as it was unfolding, and certainly now ‚Äî has too often been eclipsed by the struggle against Hitler and Mussolini in Europe and North Africa. Toll has an affinity for the detailed narrative of military conflict and for capsule portraiture of key personalities both high-ranking and low. Toll is especially skilled at setting his story in context, taking the reader on valuable excursions into subjects like the impact of Alfred Thayer Mahan‚Äôs views on naval strategy and the history of Japanese expansionism. He effectively conveys the gloom of the Allies over Japan‚Äôs dominance in Asia and the Pacific in the spring of 1942: \\"The Japanese offensive had made a mockery of their predictions, deranged their plans, sapped their morale, undercut their leaders‚Äô reputations and torn at the seams of their global coalition.\\" Andrew Wiese writes in the San Diego Union Tribune, \\"Among Toll‚Äôs paramount achievements is his skill in weaving events across a wide scale into a coherent, compelling narrative. Toll combines the grand and the mundane from the halls of government to the lower decks: the naval tactics of Alfred Thayer Mahan, great power diplomacy and Japanese politics, as well as blackout nights in Hawaii, salt water showers and canned Spam.\\" Rear Admiral Richard Gentz writes in his review for the Naval Historical Foundation, \\"Toll pulls it all together with logic and vivid word pictures of the action.\\" The book was the winner of the Northern California Book Award for Nonfiction in 2012. =Reviews= * Beschloss, M.

Toll. The book is a narrative history of the middle phase of the Pacific War, which took place in the central and southern Pacific between the Allies and the Empire of Japan. It was published by W. W. Norton & Company in 2015 (hardcover and Kindle) and 2016 (paperback). It was released as an audiobook narrated by P. J. Ochlan by Recorded Books in 2015. The first volume in the trilogy, Pacific Crucible: War at Sea in the Pacific, 1941‚Äì1942, was published in 2011; the final volume in the trilogy, Twilight of the Gods: War in the Western Pacific, 1944-1945, was published in 2020. Synopsis Continuing the story of the Pacific war, The Conquering Tide covers the period from June 1942 to June 1944, a time frame that starts with the fighting during the Solomon Islands , Guadalcanal, and New Guinea campaigns, continues into the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign and ends with the dramatic Japanese defeats during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Battle of the Philippine Sea, which sets the stage for the final phase of the war in the approach to and on the Japanese home islands. In writing about the scope of the subject of covered in the The Conquering Tide, the Dallas Morning News review states, > \\"The Pacific War was the largest, bloodiest, most costly, most technically > innovative, and most logistically complex amphibious war in history. To roll > back the tide of Japanese conquests, the Allies would be required to seize > one island after another, advancing across thousands of miles of ocean in > two huge parallel offensives on either side of the equator. The army, navy, > and marines were compelled to work together in sustained and intricate > cooperation.\\" Both a history from below, showing the perspectives of the average soldiers, sailors, and airmen that fought the war and a history from above, showing how American military leaders, especially Admiral Ernest King, planned and executed the strategy that set the stage for the final phase of the Pacific war. Toll uses both official histories and personal recollections to tell the story of this phase of the war. He weaves personal stories from the fighter pilots that fought the Japanese in the air, the sailors on board ship that encountered them at sea, and the soldiers and marines that fought them on countless islands, together with thoughts, plans, and reactions of the leaders that guided the progress of the war, to provide the reader with a compelling narrative of how the war unfolded. Toll provides insights into the Japanese perspective of the conflict. An example of the vivid details he includes are the feelings and perspectives of normal Japanese merchant seaman; Toll recounts, \\"In the navy‚Äôs hierarchy, recalled one veteran merchant mariner, he and his shipmates \\"were lower than military horses, less important than military dogs, even lower than military carrier pigeons.\\" On one ship with a mixed crew, all merchant mariners were confined below, while only Etajima (naval academy) graduates were allowed to take in the sun and sea air on deck. \\"That was their attitude. There was no sense you were all fighting together. You can‚Äôt win with such an attitude.\\"\\" On the opposite end of the spectrum, Toll shows the growing power and dominance of General Tojo and his allies in the Japanese government, and his eventual fall from power and replacement by Kuniaki Koiso, a retired general and the Japanese proconsul in charge of Korea, who nonetheless continued Tojo's failed policies and \\"dutifully mouthed the same bellicose avowals and victory forecasts that had been Tojo‚Äôs trademark\\". The many ways the Japanese had prepared for a war against the United States is explained in the first part of the book and is demonstrated throughout. Because air power was central to the fighting in the Pacific, Toll points out the often superiority of Japanese fighters and medium bombers and the skill in which Japanese pilots handled them. As was the case in the first volume, the author shows how preconceived notions and prejudices on both sides continued to be shattered. However these lessons were learned slowly and these misconceptions led both sides to disastrous conclusions before they eventually dissolved and were replaced with more accurate, albeit incomplete and racist, assessments of the skills and abilities of their enemy. The Japanese notion of the Americans as \\"soft, too used to comfort to be effective in battle; not able to withstand the rigors of submarine service\\" and Allied notions of the Japanese as technologically second rate with poorly trained personnel proved to be costly arrogance. The Japanese held one advantage in this regard; knowing the attitude of those they were about to fight, they used this to their advantage; Toll writes, \\"Playing cleverly on the hubris and racial chauvinism of their Western rivals, the Japanese had disguised the formidable power of their air fleets and airmen.\\" However Toll also quotes Japanese Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura on what would prove the most disastrous miscalculation of the war, \\"You came far more quickly than we expected.\\" After detailing the misconceptions and flaws of the two sides, the middle portion of the book largely focuses on the remarkable transformation of the American military as it island hopped across the Pacific and the inability of the Japanese to respond effectively or understand the position they were in. Toll documents the increasing material strength of the United States, growing from a devastated Pacific battleship fleet with a few precious aircraft carriers, into a force capable of striking across the Pacific at will. He not only shows the material growth in the military but also the organizational, tactical, and strategic growth that developed in tandem with it. Toll concludes the story with the history of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the climax of the war in the central and southern Pacific which set the stage for the war in the western Pacific and Japanese home islands. > \\"This reviewer was particularly struck by Toll‚Äôs description of the Japanese > fight to the bitter end on Saipan and the decision by thousands of civilians > to take their lives rather than surrender. Despite the bitterness of defeat, > we pledge Seven lives to repay our country\\" was part of Yoshitsugu Saito's > last instruction to his battered forces. \\"About 3,000 Japanese troops > answered the call\\" to report to a staging point and charged down a narrow- > gauge railway into the Americans in a banzai charge shortly before 5 a.m. > Those who had rifles fixed bayonets, those without fixed knives or bayonets > on long poles. At the rear but pressing forward was \\"a pathetic cavalcade of > sick and wounded men, bleeding and bandaged, some hobbling along on > crutches, many with no weapons at all. ... Summing up, Toll noted, \\"Capture > of the Marianas and the accompanying ruin of Japanese carrier airpower were > final and irreversible blows to the hopes of the Japanese imperial > project.\\"'' \\" In the final pages of the book, Toll asserts three conclusions that summarize the state of the war in mid 1944: > \\"That two such colossal assaults could be launched against fortified enemy > shores, in the same month and at opposite ends of the Eurasian landmass was > a supreme demonstration of American militaryindustrial hegemony.\\" > \\"The Americans had developed the capability to project overwhelming force > into the distant frontiers of the western Pacific, and no tactical > masterstroke or blunder could reverse the increasingly lopsided balance of > power between the two combatants.\\" > Just as Toll concludes his first volume with the earlier decisive Battle of > Midway in the eastern Pacific, in the conclusion of this volume he makes the > convincing argument that the victory in the Marianas was the decisive moment > in the Pacific War. \\"Though Americans were slow to appreciate it they had > just won the decisive victory of the Pacific War.\\" Reception * \\"On the American side, Toll‚Äôs narrative deftly moves between the towering figures ‚Äì King, Nimitz, Halsey, Holland Smith, and deck-plate sailors and Marines who ‚Äúdo not know how many of the Japanese civilians [italics in text] will actively fight us.‚Äù He weaves the Japanese narrative in a similarly efficient and coherent way. Conquering Tide is not a Navy and Marine battle action history. It is a compelling account from the biggest of pictures of the ‚ÄúEurope first‚Äù strategy to the tiniest of pixels to help readers born years and decades after these events understand what happened, why it occurred, and ultimately what it all meant at the time to the Americans and Japanese.\\" * \\"The writing has a very visual aspect, yet the details do not overwhelm the reader, nor does the well‚Äêorganized and documented narrative. Told from the points of view of different military and political perspectives covering both sides of the war, plus allied concerns, the story never gets lost as it progresses through the period included. The battle stories include human stories and anecdotes from those not necessarily heard from, including those in the foxholes. Attitudes are explained with ease and controversies covered.\\" * \\"The Conquering Tide is heavily researched and spans nearly 600 pages. Yet Toll's absorbing text flows smoothly and quickly, helped along by anecdotes and stories involving combatants and political leaders on both sides, plus coast watchers who spied on the Japanese from mountaintops and jungles and risked their lives to radio attack warnings.\\" The Conquering Tide was a New York Times best selling non-fiction book. =Reviews= * Borneman, W.

He collected plants in Austria and Italy. After graduating from Vienna's Schottengymnasium, Stockmayer studied medicine and botany from 1886 to 1892 at the University of Vienna, where his teachers included Julius Wiesner and Hans Molisch. At the University of Vienna, Stockmayer graduated in 1892 as Dr. med. and from 1892 to 1894 was an assistant professor for general and experimental pathology. After working as a general practitioner in Frankenfels and then in Unterwaltersdorf (now a part of Ebreichsdorf), he became the owner of his own medical practice in Stammersdorf (now a part of Vienna). In his student days he was interested in botany, which was furthered by his friendship with G√ºnther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau. As a young general practitioner, Stockmayer gained a reputation as a phycologist and made contributions to the Schedae ad 'Kryptogamas exsiccatas' ... (Notes on cryptogamic exsiccatae) in the Annalen des k. k. naturhistorischen Hofmuseums (1894). Later in his career he was particularly interested in thermophilic blue-green algae, which he collected in Warmbad Villach in the summer. At his villa in Stammersdorf, he set up a research laboratory and library for specialized work on phycology. He planned a thorough study of the algae found in Lake Neusiedl. However, his algological research was limited by his work as a physician. Nevertheless, he published many outstanding scientific papers on blue-green algae and motivated the photographer Alexander Niklitschek to investigate the movement problem in the genus Oscillatoria. From 1889 Stockmayer was a member of Austria's Zoologisch- Botanische Gesellschaft (a non-profit society founded in 1851 for the promotion of knowledge about zoology and botany).

Completed in mid-1944, the ship played a minor role in the Battle off Cape Enga√±o in October, escorting aircraft carriers and then began escorting convoys. She was damaged during the Battle of Ormoc Bay in December escorting a troop convoy in the Philippines and then escorted cruisers on a bombarment mission during Operation Rei later that month. Sugi was damaged again by American aircraft during the South China Sea raid in January 1945 and then escorted a convoy back to Japan in February where she was repaired. Inactive for the rest of the war, she was surrendered to the Allies at the end of the war and used to repatriate Japanese troops until 1947. Mid-year the destroyer was turned over to the Republic of China and renamed Hui Yang. The ship was not placed back in commission and was cannibalized for spare parts until she was stricken in 1954 and subsequently scrapped. Design and description Designed for ease of production, the Matsu class was smaller, slower and more lightly armed than previous destroyers as the IJN intended them for second-line duties like escorting convoys, releasing the larger ships for missions with the fleet.Stille, p. 38 The ships measured long overall, with a beam of and a draft of .Chesneau, p. 196 Their crew numbered 210 officers and enlisted men.Stille, p. 45 They displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley, p. 206 The ships had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of for a speed of . The Matsus had a range of at .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 151 The main armament of the Matsu-class ships consisted of three Type 89 dual-purpose guns in one twin-gun mount aft and one single mount forward of the superstructure. The single mount was partially protected against spray by a gun shield. The accuracy of the Type 89 guns was severely reduced against aircraft because no high-angle gunnery director was fitted. The ships carried a total of 25 Type 96 anti-aircraft guns in 4 triple and 13 single mounts. The Matsus were equipped with Type 13 early-warning and Type 22 surface-search radars.Stille, p. 41 The ships were also armed with a single rotating quadruple mount amidships for torpedos. They could deliver their 36 depth charges via two stern rails and two throwers.

On 25 October she participated in the Battle off Cape Enga√±o, escorting the aircraft carriers of the Northern Force. Sugi began convoy escort duties on 9 November when she covered a convoy from Japan to Taiwan and the Philippines and the ship was assigned to Destroyer Division 52 with four of her sisters on 15 November; five days later the division was transferred to Escort Squadron 31 of the 5th Fleet. She escorted more convoys in the Philippines and the South China Sea area afterwards and was lightly damaged by strafing American aircraft on 7 December during the Battle of Ormoc Bay; 32 crewmen were killed during the attack. Sugi was slightly damaged when aircraft from the carriers of Task Force 38 attacked Manila Harbor a week later. The following day the ship sailed for Cam Ranh Bay in occupied-French IndochinaNevitt to participate in Operation Rei, an attack on the American forces at San Jose on the island of Mindoro. Six destroyers, including Sugi, escorted two cruisers that departed on 24 December. They were attacked by American aircraft late the next day with most ships damaged to some extent. One destroyer was sunk by the follow-up attack by PT boats, but Sugi was undamaged during the battle.Rohwer, p. 380 The disarmed Sugi en route from Sasebo to Shanghai to be turned over to the Chinese, July 1947 The ship was damaged by aircraft from Task Force 38 at Takao on 21 January 1945 during the South China Sea raid. The following month she helped to escort a convoy from Shanghai, China, to Moji, Japan on 2‚Äì7 February and was then docked in Sasebo for repairs. Escort Squadron 31 was transferred to the Combined Fleet on 5 February. Sugi sailed to Kure on 13 March and remained in the Seto Inland Sea for the rest of the war. The squadron was reassigned to the 2nd Fleet from 15 March to 20 April and then rejoined the Combined Fleet. The ship was turned over to Allied forces at Kure at the time of the surrender of Japan on 2 September and was stricken from the navy list on 5 October. The destroyer was disarmed and used to repatriate Japanese personnel in 1945‚Äì1947. Sugi was turned over to the Republic of China Navy on 31 July of the latter year and was renamed Hui Yang. Never rearmed or recommissioned, the ship was hulked and was stricken on 11 November 1954.

The sculpture might be the first notable work in marble by Duquesnoy. According to Estelle Lingo: \\"The significance that the infant putto held for Duquesnoy's vision of the Greek style is demonstrated most clearly by the Cupid carving his bow.\\" The sculpture was badly damaged during World War II, when it was shot in the head and broke into several pieces. It is currently housed at the Bode Museum in Berlin. Sculpture At first sight, the cupid in its current state may evoke a feeling of sadness. The figure, as opposed to what might be expected from a \\"cheerful, Baroque god of love,\\" appears downcast and introverted. The Cupid is bent forward, with his eyes downcast, his gaze on the ground. The damage the sculpture suffered during World War II contributes to incite a feeling of sadness. His posture is difficult to comprehend without knowledge of the sculpture's history. There is an account by Duquesnoy's biographer and friend Joachim von Sandrart on the making of this sculpture. According to Sandrart, Duquesnoy was famous in Rome for his sculptures of children and infant putti, but had worked mostly in wax and clay so far (according to Gian Pietro Bellori, however, just a few years after his arrival in Rome Duquesnoy was forced to carve works in ivory and wood as well). In his biography of Duquesnoy, then, Sandrart claims that the Fiammingo wanted to show his mastery of marble, and thence produced the Cupid Carving His Bow. That would make the sculpture the firs work in marble by Duquesnoy, or at any rate his first notable oeuvre in marble. No buyer for the sculpture could be found at first, but Sandrart was eventually able to sell the Cupid to a merchant named Lucas van Uffel (or van Uffen), then resident in Venice. Cupid Carving His Bow, prewar photo In 1637 the sculpture was purchased by the city council of Amsterdam, whereto the Cupid had been brought by Van Uffel. It was given as a gift to Princess Amalia of Orange-Nassau by the city council. Alternatively, the sculpture was sold to Van Uffel by Sandrart in Amsterdam, and passed to the Amsterdam city council upon the former's death. The princess set the sculpture in her pleasure garden in The Hague. From thence, the sculpture ended up in Brandenburg, where it is recorded in a 1689 inventory of the elector's kunstkammer. Still frame from the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin - Retina Fabrik video clip showing Cupid's temple hit by gunfire The statue was badly damaged during World War II: in 1945, the sculpture was put into a bunker in Friedrichshain. There was a fire in the bunker, as well as gunfire, which hit the sculpture. Demage by gunfire is clearly visible on the Cupid's temple. Possibly because of the one shot in the Cupid's temple, the sculpture fell onto the ground and broke into pieces. The statue was moved to Russia, where it was reassembled. The sculpture came back to Berlin in the 1950s, and was further restored there in the 1990s. Although, as mentioned, the figure might at first sight seem introverted and perhaps even downhearted, he is actually concentrated on carving his bow. Rather than having downcast eyes, the cupid is \\"carving his bow with great concentration.\\" References Further reading * * External links * Video clip describing the oeuvre at Staatliche Museen zu Berlin * Cupid Carving His Bow at Google Arts & Culture * Sculpture at Bode-Museum * Close up of the sculpture at Blind Bild Category:1620s sculptures Category:1630s sculptures Category:Sculptures by Fran√ßois Duquesnoy Category:Sculptures in Germany Category:Marble sculptures Category:Marble sculptures in Germany Category:Sculptures of the Berlin State Museums ","title":"Cupid Carving His Bow"},{"id":"65372810","text":"Key Pittman (1872‚Äì1940) was a U.S. Senator from Nevada from 1913 to 1940.

At a distance of about from Earth, it is the outer component of a visual triple star system consisting of an inner pair of red dwarf stars. The white dwarf displays a featureless absorption spectrum, lacking strong optical absorption or emission features in its atmosphere. It has an effective temperature of , corresponding to an age of approximately 5.8 billion years. WD 1856+534 is approximately half as massive as the Sun, while its radius is much smaller, being 40% larger than Earth.  Planetary system  The white dwarf is known to host one exoplanet, WD 1856b, in orbit around it. The exoplanet was detected through the transit method by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) between July and August 2019. An analysis of the transit data in 2020 revealed that it is a Jupiter-like giant planet with a radius over ten times that of Earth's, and orbits its host star closely at a distance of 0.02 astronomical units, with an orbital period 60 times shorter than that of Mercury around the Sun. The unexpectedly close distance of the exoplanet to the white dwarf implies that it must have migrated inward after its host star evolved from a red giant to a white dwarf, otherwise it would have been engulfed by its star. Later research indicated the planet may instead has survived a common envelope phase.

Background  After the Austrian-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, the new government tried to impose its dominance over the three religious groups living there: the Muslims, the Eastern Orthodox, and the Catholics by separating them from their spiritual centres. The first efforts by the Catholic Church to establish its hierarchy in Bosnia and Herzegovina dates back to the 13th century, and there were several attempts afterward, however, due to political circumstances and the opposition from the Franciscans, these attempts failed. In 1327, Pope John XXII gave the Franciscans exclusive right over inquisition and pastoral care in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who in return gained a number of privileges, including the election of provincials, apostolic visitors, vicars and bishops.  History  In the wake of the Austrian-Hungarian occupation, a number of critiques and accusations against the Franciscans were sent to Rome, often from the Franciscans themselves, but also from those who sought to gain a position in the restored hierarchy. However, on a session of Roman cardinals held on 23 June 1879, 17 out of 19 cardinals voted against the restoration, claiming that it would hurt the interests of Catholics there, nevertheless Roma Curia was still interested in the restoration. The Austrian-Hungarian authorities wanted to diminish the dominance of the Franciscans, who were connected to the South Slavic national movements, but also at the same time to establish a hierarchy that would enable them the political control over the Church affairs. On 13 August 1880, the Roman Curia gave a maximalist proposal to its negotiators with Austria-Hungary, in which they demanded the establishment of an archdiocese with metropolitan rights with a seat in Sarajevo; establishment of four suffragan dioceses, of which two in Bosnia seated in Banja Luka and Tuzla and two in Herzegovina, one seated in Mostar and the already existing Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan. The Emperor was supposed to have the right to appoint bishops as elsewhere in the Monarchy. The Curia also requested the establishment of a seminary in Sarajevo for the education of the secular clergy for all the dioceses, with the expense being paid by the Monarchy, who will also finance the bishops and priests. With only 200,000 Catholics in the country at the time, the Curia proposed such an expensive proposal with the aim to profile itself against the Eastern Orthodoxy and to convert the Bosnian Muslims. The Austrian-Hungarian authorities responded with a minimalist proposal, in which they suggested the establishment of only two dioceses, one for Bosnia in Sarajevo, and the other for Herzegovina in Mostar. The bishops were to be appointed by the Emperor, as elsewhere in the Monarchy. Austria-Hungary insisted on Franciscans taking pastoral care, with the introduction of secular clergy only when necessary. = 1881 Convention = The negotiations between the Roman Curia and Austria-Hungary were concluded on 8 June 1881, where the Curia drew the shorter straw. The Convention the two sides agreed upon included the establishment of a province, separate from all other provinces in the Monarchy, that would have an archdiocese in Sarajevo, with three suffragan dioceses, one in Mostar for Herzegovina and one in Banja Luka for Western Bosnia. The existing Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan was to remain under the administration of Bishop of Dubrovnik. Further, they agreed upon the establishment of capitol in Sarajevo with four canons, while the regional government in Sarajevo would subsidise the archbishop in Sarajevo with 8.000 forints, bishop in Mostar with 6.000 forints, administrator of Banja Luka with 3.000 forints, while each canon in Sarajevo would receive 2.000 forints. A new seminary was to be established in Sarajevo, which would be financed by the regional government. The emperor had a right to appoint bishops, without the Pope mentioning his name in the bull. The Pope had a right to appoint the administrator of Banja Luka, with consultations with the emperor.  The bull  On 5 July 1881, Pope Leo XIII issued Ex hac augusta Principis Apostolorum cathedra, a bull by which he restored the regular Church hierarchy in Bosnia and Herzegovina. With the restoration, both vicariates, the Bosnian (1735-1881) and the Herzegovinian (1846-81) were abolished. Pope established the Archdiocese of Vrhbosna with the seat in Sarajevo and subordinated to it three other dioceses: the newly established Diocese of Banja Luka, the already existing Diocese of Trebinje-Mrkan (under the apostolic administration from the bishop of Dubrovnik at the time) and the Diocese of Mostar-Duvno, to which he added the title of bishop of Duvno as well. The Diocese of Mostar-Duvno encompassed the territory of the Apostolic Vicariate of Herzegovina, which was abolished. The Apostolic Vicar of Bosnia Pa≈°kal Vuiƒçiƒá was simply retired after the abolishment of the vicariate, while the Apostolic Vicar of Herzegovina Pa≈°kal Buconjiƒá was appointed Bishop of Mostar-Duvno. Josip Stadler was appointed the Archbishop of Vrhbosna and Administrator of Banja Luka. On 8 July 1890, the Pope exempted Trebinje-Mrkan from Bishop of Dubrovnik, and named Bishop of Mostar-Duvno its administrator.

Life and Work  Harry Kalmer was born in Bellville as fourth child of Kenneth Kalmer and Johanna Steyn; the family soon moved to Johannesburg where Harry completed his schooling before achieving his B.A. in Afrikaans-Nederlands and Drama at the University of Pretoria. From 1980-81 he was conscripted into the SADF and deployed as a lieutenant in Namibia; given the context of Namibia's war for independence, this was a formative period for some of his later creative work; he came to be classified as one of the Tagtigers, an anti-apartheid Afrikaans literary clique and was socially connected with Vo√´lvry, a loose but influential grouping of dissident performersPienaar, Clara (2012): Vo√´lvry and the ‚ÄúOutlawed‚Äù Afrikaners (Masters thesis, University of Witwatersrand) usually characterised as Afrikaners but including a member classified as \\"coloured\\" and an English- speaker (albeit a thoroughly bilingual one). In 1983 Kalmer married Sanpat Hattingh, a fashion designer. For the rest of the 1980s they lived in Yeoville, which was then a \\"transgressive space\\"; in the 1990s they moved to neighboring Observatory and had two children, Dani√´l and Jana. From 1991 Kalmer left his job in advertising to be a freelance writer; in 2010 he registered at the University of Stellenbosch for an M.A. in creative writing, which he obtained in 2014. His death in 2019 came after a short struggle against cancer.  Writings  Kalmer had eight books published (as well as contributing short stories/chapters to several published collections including a posthumous one), and around twenty plays staged. He also won many prizes for advertising copy. Kalmer's first play to be staged was Bloed in die strate (176 interviews for television) (1984 - in which year he also wrote Piet Joubert and the Boer War Show and Die val van Pretoria, dramas which were both shortlisted for awards), followed by Hartland (1986), Die o√´ van hulle wit (1988) and then in 1989 both Antjie Somers and I and Kalmer's first book Die waarheid en ander stories, a collection of short stories. In 1991 his next play was staged, Watercolour days, and in 1992, another play, They say heaven is like TV. Also in 1992, Kalmer ventured into new territory, directing his own first cabaret, The secret of my excess, performed by Lynn Joffe. These were followed in 1993 by X-Ray Visagie en die Vingers van God, a novel, in 1995 by the play Frida Kahlo‚Äôs eyes, and in 1996 by the play Sleeping with Alice. Kalmer went on to adapt for stage the novel Die dinge van 'n kind by Marita van der Vyver (1998) and in the same year wrote Die man met die dertien kinders, a novella which was also dramatised for radio. Kniediep (1999) is another novel; Briewe aan 'n rooi dak (2002) was initially a dramatic monologue, later filmed, broadcast and distributed on DVD. Its narrative was later to become the first part of En die lekkerste deel van dood wees (2007), a novel of which the second part was staged as Wolke (2007). Meanwhile, Kalmer had written and staged Die Bitterbek Blues of Ben (Die Breker) Baartman(2002), Oor die berge (2004), Wie is Spek Harmse en waarom skryf hy Afrikaanse advertensies? (2004), Die vloek van die strandjutwolf (2004) and Meneer de Beer (2005), as well as published Groceries ‚Äì 56 stories oor huishoudelike produkte(2006), a collection of stories about household products. In 2009 Kalmer's play Die vloek van die strandjutwolf was staged; he also wrote Unwined which was not. Around this time he contributed scripts to TV series such as Isidingo, Binnelanders and Diver down. He had a column Vlieger in the Rapport newspaper which was so popular that he eventually based a play on it, Vlieger Unplugged (2011). Kalmer's last play, Die Bram Fischer wals (2012, performed in English in 2013 as The Bram Fischer Waltz) was his most political work and won the Adelaide Tambo prize for human rights in the arts.

In 2016 the school was honored by a Declaratoria de Benem√©rito de la Patria, (Declaration of Merit of the Homeland), which recognized the historical distinction of the school, and also provided for campuses of the school to be established in each of the seven provinces in Costa Rica. History In 1943, Carlos Millet de Castella died and left a legacy of ‚Ç°100,000 and a plot of land to create a Conservatory of Music in San Jos√© named in honor of his mother, Elena de Castella Canillo. He specified that the governing board was to have members named by the Secretariat of Public Education, the Cultural Association of Musicians, the Association of Artists and Writers, and the National Insurance Bank. In 1947, the Asociaci√≥n Conservatorio de Castella (Castella Conservatory Association) was created and the property and funds were transferred by the courts to the association. Arnoldo Herrera Gonz√°lez, the director of the National Symphony Orchestra, was appointed to run the school in 1950 by the Ministry of Education. On 25 November 1953, the first facilities for the conservatory were completed and were inaugurated in a ceremony attended by President Jos√© Figueres; the archbishop of San Jos√©, ; the Minister of Education, ; and Herrera. Having been raised in an era when artists were not supported nor well-regarded by society, Herrera wanted to create an institution which would promote art and artists from every social class. The pedagogical model used by Herrera was one which combined academic, artistic and scientific education to develop students with a life-long passion and critical sense of life, social responsibility and happiness. Inspired by the Montessori method, Herrera believed \\"El secreto de la educaci√≥n reside en la libertad. Si hay libertad, hay creatividad, y si hay creatividad, hay trascendencia\\". (The secret of education lies in freedom. If there is freedom, there is creativity, and if there is creativity, there is transcendence). The first classes were held in 1954, in the building which is now the Teatro Arnoldo Herrera. Students received academic training in the morning and after lunch received interdisciplinary artistic training, which might include dance, painting, music, or folkloric study. A new campus was built and the school moved to Barreal de Heredia, in the Ulloa canton, in 1974. Current school The Conservatory is now a public institution which promotes artistic development along with formal education designated by the Ministry of Public Education for primary and secondary students. The primary artistic studies available include courses in architecture, dance, folklore, literature, music, painting, sculpture, theater, and audio-visual arts.

Her father Tesai Sono (ÂúíË≤ûÈΩã), a doctor who lived in Tokyo, was descended from Sono's great-grandfather, Moan Wakazono, a wealthy philosopher from Nagoya. Sono had three siblings; two brothers and her sister Haruko Sono (Êò•Â≠êÂúí) who operated a local women's school in Ibaraki. In 1859, Teruko began learning waka (poetry) from her father. In 1865, Sono married a local Japanese man and in 1869 she gave birth to their daughter. However due to his drinking, she divorced him and he returned to his parents' village, taking Sono's daughter with him. It was around this time though that women like Tsuda Umeko began travelling to the United States, that upper-class women like Sono, began to learn more about the rights of women in other countries. From 1871 until 1874 under the guidance of Haruko she worked thus as a teacher in Ibaraki. In 1874, worried about her daughter's future education, Sono became what is now called the first female 'lawyer'(‰ª£Ë®Ä‰∫∫ or daigennin) in Japan, and sought legal custody of her daughter through the courts and moved to work as a lawyer in Edo in the same year with the child. During this time in Japan, the judicial system did not require that a plaintiff have any special permission or having been accepted by any bar system, so the case was won after only 3 months with Sono representing herself as a Daigennin. After winning the case, Sono established herself as a full lawyer in Tokyo working in a practice with the Daigennin/lawyer, Kotaro Watanabe (Ê∏°Ëæ∫Â∞èÂ§™ÈÉé), becoming popular in Japan being known as the 'woman barrister'. Sono again remarried, but did not fully commit to the marriage, divorcing again prior to 1876. In 1876 she opened an 'ice shop' popular in summer which sold shave ice in Asakusa, and her sister Haruko also died. Sono was reported to dress in Hakama and walk around dressed like a woman but with the ambition of a man.ÈÉµ‰æøÂ†±Áü•, Nov. 15, 1876L.Frank, La Femme Avocat, 1898, pp. 125‚Äì126Mrs Griffith, A Japanese Lady Lawyer and Reformer in England, 1893, 10 Great Thoughts, p. 91The First Women Lawyers: A Comparative Study of Gender, Law and the Legal, Mary Jane Fossman, p. 241, 2006 Sono worked thus as a lawyer until she began reconsidering the importance of women's education and prompted by Fukuzawa Yukichi, in December 1885 she left Japan to travel to the West to learn about women's educational reform.The Law Times, Volume 94, Office of The Law Times, 1893, p. 333 In 1886 she arrived in San Francisco in January and helped form the Tokyo Women's Association (Êù±‰∫¨Â©¶‰∫∫ÁüØÈ¢®‰ºö), working as a maid, and later teaching art to toddlers, after the Bank she had deposited her savings in went bankrupt and was also at first rejected for school due to her age.

It was first isolated from bovine rumen in 2008. Its ability to produce relatively large quantities of succinic acid through fermentation in biomass hydrolysates is potentially important for industrial biotechnology.  Features  Its beneficial features include broad facultative anaerobic metabolism, genetic tractability, and substrate utilization. The bacterium is cocci to rod-shaped and, like all Pasteurellaceae, has no flagella, i.e., it cannot actively move. The bacterium is gram-negative, i.e., it only has a thin, single-layer murein envelope that does not contain any teichoic acids. Information on individual cell sizes is not scientifically documented. Colonies reach a diameter of 0.1 to 0.5 millimeters after 24 hours of growth and are colored translucent gray. Basfia succiniciproducens, like the majority of proteobacteria, was characterized solely by physiological or biochemical features, while it has no eidonomic features compared to other species and genera of the Pasteurellaceae. The first description fulfills the minimum standards applicable for characterizing a new species and genus within the Pasteurellaceae. All known strains anaerobically produce significant amounts of succinic acid, acetic acid, and formic acid as metabolic products during fermentation.  Isolation  The bacterium was isolated during a screening for bacteria from the rumen of domestic cattle that are potentially useful in succinic acid production. It was first isolated in 2008, but its scientific description was made available in 2009. However, according to information from Kuhnert et al. 2009, it was not validly described.  Characteristics  B. succiniciproducens can be cultivated biotechnologically both on the classic fermentation medium glucose (sugar syrup, starch) and on glycerine. Glycerin is obtained as raw glycerin in the production of rapeseed methyl ester (biodiesel) in large quantities and is therefore available as an inexpensive raw material for combined use. In 2008, Scholten was able to achieve yields of up to 5.8 g/l succinic acid based on D-glucose and sucrose with the newly isolated and at the time not yet described bacterium, with a productivity of up to 1.5 g/l 1¬∑h, and the yield was a maximum of 0.6 grams of succinic acid per gram of substrate. They achieved yields of 8.4 g/l, 0.9 g/l¬∑h, and 1.2 g/g substrate with raw glycerol. In comparison with other bacteria, particularly Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens, Escherichia coli, and Actinobacillus succinogenes, the maximum yield per liter is comparatively low, but the yield based on the substrate input and the productivity are comparable and can also be optimized by optimizing the logs. Bacteria based on raw glycerin as a substrate, for which the first approaches to continuous cultivation are in development, show particularly good properties.  Application of succinic acid  Succinic acid is a chemical with an annual demand of around 15,000 tons. It is conventionally produced based on butadiene and n-butane with maleic anhydride as an intermediate. It is primarily used as a basis for various chemical and pharmaceutical industries (tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-butanediol, etc.) and bio- based plastics such as polyamides (PA), polyesters, co-polyesters, and polyesteramides. Succinic acid is of interest as a biotechnologically manufactured product, and the market potential of several hundred thousand tons is forecasted. Together with other representatives of the C4-dicarboxylic acids, such as fumaric and malic acid, the US Department of Energy identified succinic acid in 2004 as one of twelve platform chemicals with particular biotechnological manufacturing potential. Various other potential succinic acid producers have been examined, such as Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens, Escherichia coli, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, and Corynebacterium glutamicum. Metabolic engineering for the production of high quantities of succinic acid should be optimized.

The twenty-second tropical depression and twenty-third tropical or subtropical storm of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Beta originally formed from a trough of low pressure that developed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on September 10\\\\. The low moved slowly southwestward, with development hampered initially by the development of nearby Hurricane Sally. After Sally moved inland over the Southeastern United States and weakened, the disturbance became nearly stationary in the southwestern Gulf, where it began to organize. By September 16, the storm had gained a low-level circulation center and enough organization to be designated as Tropical Depression Twenty-Two. The system held its intensity for a day under the influence of strong wind shear and dry air before attaining tropical storm strength. It slowly moved northward and intensified to a mid-range tropical storm before dry air and wind shear halted its intensification. Beta then became nearly stationary on September 19, before starting to move west towards the Texas coast the next day, weakening as it approached. On September 21, Beta made landfall near Matagorda Peninsula, Texas as a minimal tropical storm. It subsequently weakened to a tropical depression the next day before becoming a post-tropical early on September 23\\\\. Its remnants moved northeastward before the center elongated and merged with a cold front early on September 25\\\\. The storm's sprawling nature and slow-movement caused numerous areas along the Gulf Coast to be pounded by heavy surf and high waves for several days, while torrential rainfall and storm surge affected areas that were already struggling to recover from previous tropical cyclones, such as Hurricanes Laura and Sally. Several streets, highways, and even interstates in Houston were closed due to flooding. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas were all impacted by flooding, gusty winds, and severe weather as well. One fatality in Texas due to Beta's impacts has been confirmed. Total damage from the storm was estimated to be at least $100 million. Meteorological history The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor a trough at 12:00 UTC on September 10. Little to no development of the system occurred as it began to slowly turn southwestward and by September 14, it was not expected to become a tropical cyclone due to strong upper-level winds produced by nearby Hurricane Sally. Nonetheless, the disturbance persisted and moved southwestward into the southwestern Gulf of Mexico where it began to organize as Sally moved away into the Southeastern United States early on September 16. The next day, hurricane hunters found a closed circulation, and as thunderstorms persisted near the center, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Twenty-Two at 23:00 UTC on September 17. At 21:00 UTC on September 18, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Beta, becoming the earliest 23rd tropical or subtropical storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season, surpassing the old mark of October 22, established by Tropical Storm Alpha of 2005. Although affected by wind shear and dry air, the storm continued to intensify, reaching a peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a pressure of 994 mb (29.36 inHg) at 15:00 UTC on September 19. However, it became nearly stationary after turning westward over the Gulf of Mexico. This caused upwelling and the continued negative effects of dry air and wind shear caused the storm to become disorganized, although its wind speeds remained the same thanks to an outflow boundary. After jogging northeastward, Beta's convection continued to wax and wane as the storm moved west-northwest with the center reforming to the west. As Beta approached the Texas coast, it weakened some before making landfall on the Matagorda Peninsula at 04:00 UTC on September 22 with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a pressure of 999 mb (29.50 inHg). Afterwards, Beta weakened some more, falling to tropical depression status at 15:00 UTC. It then became nearly stationary again before turning east and weakening some more, causing the NHC to issue their final advisory and giving future advisory responsibilities to the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). Beta then became a post-tropical cyclone at 03:00 UTC on September 23 and accelerated northeastward, passing through Louisiana and Mississippi into Northern Alabama. The center became less determinant and the heavy rainfall threat diminished and the WPC issued their final advisory at 09:00 UTC on September 25. Preparations View of Southern Corpus Christi Bay as Tropical Storm Beta was nearing the Texas coast. Tropical storm, hurricane, and storm surge watches were issued along a large portion of the coastline from the Texas-Mexico border to south central Louisiana in advance of the storm. The hurricane watches were later dropped when the storm failed to strengthen past 60 mph, but most of the other watches were upgraded to warnings. Several voluntary evacuations were issued by city and county governments over concerns of particularly vulnerable areas around Houston and Galveston. Flood warnings and watches of various types were issued throughout Texas and Louisiana as the storm approached coastal Texas and then made landfall. As the storm moved inland into Louisiana, a tornado watch was issued for the southern and eastern part of the state as well as Southern Mississippi. Impacts Post-Tropical Cyclone Beta moving through Alabama on September 24. On September 18, prior to the system being upgraded into a tropical storm, a Hurricane Hunter mission which started at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi was aborted when lightning from the system struck the Lockheed WC-130J Hercules sent to gather data causing the plane's radar systems to go down, endangering the occupants of the flight. A tornado warning was issued for Galveston County, Texas on the afternoon of September 21, although no tornadoes was confirmed. A number of flash flood warnings were also issued as rainbands began to continually move over the same areas. On September 23, favorable atmospheric conditions led to a flurry of tornado, severe thunderstorm and special marine warnings as the remnants of the storm moved through Louisiana and into Mississippi. Coastal flooding from Beta in Corpus Christi, Texas Heavy surf and high waves from Beta destroyed part of a pier in Galveston, Texas while storm surge flooding left many areas of the Texas coast under water. Around the time of landfall, a wind gust of 48 mph (77 km/h) was recorded in Port Lavaca. Parts of I-69 and TX 288 were closed by flooding and high water rescue teams responded to dozens of calls for help. By the time Beta had weakened to a tropical depression on September 22, over 100 high-water rescues had taken place in Houston as portions of the city became heavily inundated by the storm's high rainfall totals, exceeding 9‚Äù (22 cm) in parts of the city. Dozens of streets and highways in the city, including parts of I-69, I-45, and TX 288 and 290, were closed by fast-rising water. Officials urged residents to stay home and avoid driving if possible. The sprawling nature of the storm also brought heavy rainfall to Louisiana, which was still recovering from a number of other systems that had affected the state during the season. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued disaster declarations for 29 counties, while Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency. A missing fisherman who had gone into Brays Bayou during the storm was later discovered drowned. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and gusty winds also impacted Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama, and Georgia. The remnants of the storm fueled a small severe weather event across the Carolinas on September 25 with severe thunderstorms producing wind damage and unusually significant hail up to in diameter. An EF0 tornado was also confirmed in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina as well.

It was established during the copper boom of the early 1920s to supply the new mining and refining companies, including worker housing and industrial construction. Creation Katanga is in the heart of the continent and has no navigable water route to the ocean. The ores from the rich copper mines of the region had to be refined to reduce their bulk, and thus cut transport costs. Cimenkat was one of a number of construction-related companies founded to support housing for the growing workforce and other types of construction for the mining companies. The Soci√©t√© Ciments du Katanga was created by royal decree on 16 January 1922 to supply cement to the rapidly growing Union Mini√®re du Haut-Katanga (UMHK) and other companies in southern Katanga and the two Kasais. The founders included the Soci√©t√© Belge et Mini√®re du Katanga, the Compagnie du Congo pour le Commerce et l'industrie, the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, the Belgo- Katanga and others. Belgian Congo Directors in the early years included Alphonse van G√®le and Louis Valcke. The cement factory in Lubudi, Katanga was commissioned at the start of 1924. By the end of 1958 its production capacity was 200,000 tonnes, including 180,000 tonnes of cement and 20,000 tonnes of clinker, which were sold to Ciments M√©tallurgiques de Jadotville. The plant at first supplied UMHK. and other Katangan companies, but its market also extended to neighboring countries. A fibrocement factory was established in 1929 to manufacture materials such as granites, artificial stones, tiles, pipes and corrugated roofing sheets. A second cement plant was founded in Likasi in 1953. Its cement was particularly suitable for foundation work, since it was resistant to groundwater loaded with sulphate. Democratic Republic of the Congo Under the law of 17 June 1960 the company came under Belgian law. On 13 February 1962 Ciments du Katanga transferred its property and facilities at Lubudi, and all its industrial and commercial activities, to new new company incorporated under Congolese law, Ciments et materiaux de construction du Katanga (CIMENKAT). The company was nationalized on 31 December 1974, and became completely state-owned. On 17 September 1976 it was restored to its former shareholders. As of 1995 these were GECAMINES (49.8%), EGINTER (47.4%), S.A. des Cimenteries CBR (2.1%) and ETEROUTREMER (0.7%).

Cherokee leaders Before the 1794 establishment of the Cherokee Nation, the Cherokee people had no standing government. The citizens were all considered equal, although those with the ability to speak well were highly regarded and held more power in council.

This war chief, or skiagusta, became the supreme leader of the warriors and responsible for directing hostilities towards the enemy. Skiagusta was the highest rank in the war council hierarchy, and stood immediately above the rank of outacite (or \\"mankiller\\"). The leaders of the peace (white) towns in these times continued to take council with a chosen peace chief, and the peace towns remained a haven or sanctuary for those people that needed protection, often Native American petty criminals and escaping colonial slaves.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The G-Cat 5.0 design was developed into the slightly longer G-Cat 5.7 in 1980. Production The design was built by G-Cat Multihulls in Saint Petersburg, Florida, United States, but it is now out of production. The company produced over 2,000 examples of the 5.0 and the 5.7 combined. Design The G-Cat 5.0 is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a fractional sloop rig with a fully battened mainsail, a rotating mast and all-aluminum spars. The symmetrical hulls have raked stems, vertical transoms and transom-hung, kick-up rudders controlled by a tiller. The boat has a trampoline for the crew, with an optional second one forward of the mast that can be used as the base for a tent for overnight accommodation. The design has no centerboards or daggerboards, relying instead on deep \\"V\\"-shaped hulls with a rockered shape to prevent leeway. The boat displaces .

For sailing the design is equipped with a outhaul, downhaul and a mainsheet traveler that is mounted on the aft crossbeam.

Operational history In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote that the \\"G-Cat is an unusual catamaran with symmetrical hulls and without daggerboards. Also unusual is the trampoline forward of the mast, upon which an optional tent may be pitched for cruising, (To avoid pitch-poling, remove the forward trampoline in heavy weather.)

Biography Born in the Ottakring district of Vienna, Parth grew up listening to traditional Viennese folk music, but was attracted to jazz records played by friends who were active in the Austrian resistance movement in the Second World War. After studying art he became a portrait painter and restorer of old paintings. He also started acquiring a library of old jazz and blues 78 rpm records, and became keen to share them among fellow collectors and aficionados. \\"The History of Document Records - Part 1\\", Document Records. Retrieved 20 September 2020 In the mid-1950s he started the Jazz Perspective record label, releasing short runs of LPs with hand printed covers, as well as two box sets, one covering the history of jazz music and a second covering the history of blues music. He also became the owner of the Hot Club de Vienne (now the Jazz Land club), setting up a second record label under that name, and organised music parties on riverboats on the Danube. He played the cornet and led the Blue Danube Jass Band, and organised the first Catholic \\"jazz mass\\" in Europe, as well as leading the Alpha and Omega Brass Band Vienna, which played on left wing marches. Working with his then-wife Evelyn Hruby (1941-2016), Evelyn Hruby-Sperker, Wirz.de. Retrieved 20 September 2020 and inspired by discussions with Chris Strachwitz of Arhoolie Records, he co- founded the Roots label. This initially recorded and issued albums of traditional Austrian music, but soon concentrated on reissues of vintage blues recordings by such musicians as Blind Lemon Jefferson as well as compilations. Working with record collectors and music historians from around the world, the Roots label released about 60 LPs before folding in the 1970s. Parth continued to work as an artist. He returned to music production in the late 1970s, when he produced recordings of Austrian folk music by Heini Griuc and others for the Earl Archives label. In the mid-1980s he began to consider the possibility of producing albums that compiled, in chronological order, the complete recorded works of pre-war musicians, particularly blues and gospel singers, but excluding those whose recordings had already been reissued by other labels. After finding a record pressing plant in Budapest who were prepared to produce low quantities of LPs at a reasonable cost, he set up Document Records in 1985, initially releasing records on vinyl before turning to CD production. Under Parth's supervision, Document's output became prolific, achieving its goal of re-issuing comprehensive sets of recordings of many early blues performers, and was also critically acclaimed.

The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 187 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor.Chesneau, p. 203 They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the K6s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single AA guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 124 Construction and commissioning Ro-36 was laid down as Submarine No. 202 on 7 March 1942 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan. She was renamed Ro-36 on 25 September 1942, and was provisionally attached to the Maizuru Naval District that day. She was launched on 14 October 1942 and completed and commissioned on 27 May 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-36 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District, and on 31 May 1943 she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. On 20 August 1943 she was reassigned directly to 6th Fleet headquarters, and she departed Maizuru bound for Truk on 5 September 1943. =First war patrol= Ro-36 got underway from Truk on 24 September 1943 to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the New Hebrides. Off the New Hebrides on 13 October 1943, she attacked a lone Allied merchant ship but scored no hits, and the ship escaped. That same day, 40 members of her crew became ill with food poisoning, so she received orders on 14 October 1943 to return to Truk, which she reached on 21 October 1943. While at Truk, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 on 31 October 1943. =Second war patrol= During early December 1943, Ro-36 took aboard torpedoes and supplies from the auxiliary submarine tender at Truk, and on 8 December 1943 sbe put to sea for her second war patrol with orders to conduct a reconnaissance of Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. The patrol was uneventful, and after a month at sea she returned to Truk on 8 January 1944. =Operation Hailstone= During Ro-36‚Ä≤s stay at Truk, United States Navy Task Force 58 conducted Operation Hailstone, a major attack on Truk by carrier aircraft supported by anti-shipping sweeps around the atoll by surface warships, on 17 and 18 February 1944. Ro-36 and the submarines and put to sea on 17 February in an attempt to intercept the attacking ships. Ro-36 was unsuccessful, and returned to Truk on 19 February 1944. =Third war patrol= After again receiving torpedoes and stores from Heian Maru, Ro-36 got underway from Truk to begin her third war patrol on 25 February 1944, assigned a patrol area in the Marshall Islands. On 1 March 1944, she received orders to conduct a reconnaissance of Roi in the northern portion of Kwajalein Atoll. She surfaced off Roi on 4 March 1944, but did not make contact with any Allied forces. On 16 March 1944, she was ordered to operate in an area east of Kwajalein and then proceed to Pingelap, where she was to rescue Japanese coastwatchers stranded there after the U.S. capture of Kwajalein Atoll, Roi-Namur, and Majuro. She embarked the coastwatchers at Pingelap on 23 March 1944 and set course for Truk, which she reached on 28 March 1944. =April‚ÄìJune 1944= On 15 April 1944, Ro-36 departed Truk bound for Maizuru, where she arrived on 26 April 1944 to undergo an overhaul. After its completion, she got underway from Maizuru on 4 June 1944, stopped at Saeki, and then headed for Saipan in the Mariana Islands. =Fourth war patrol= Ro-36 departed Saipan on 11 June 1944 to make a supply run to Wewak, New Guinea, to support Japanese forces fighting in the New Guinea campaign, and conduct her fourth war patrol in the waters north of New Guinea. On 13 June 1944, however, the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, activated Operation A-Go for the defense of the Mariana Islands and ordered the commander-in-chief of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi, to redeploy all 6th Fleet submarines to the Marianas. Takagi, in turn, ordered all available submarines to deploy east of the Marianas. That day, Ro-36 and the submarine were reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 and ordered to move to the Saipan area, and Ro-36 sent a routine situation and weather report to the commander of Submarine Squadron 7. The Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= Late on the evening of 13 June 1944, the destroyer was escorting battleships heading for Saipan to bombard the island when she detected a surfaced submarine on radar east of Saipan. Melvin opened fire on the submarine with her guns. The submarine submerged, and toward midnight Melvin sank it with depth charges at . The submarine Melvin sank probably was Ro-36. On 12 July 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared her to be presumed lost north of New Guinea with all 77 hands. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 August 1944.

The company produced over 2,000 examples of the 5.0 and the 5.7 combined. Design The G-Cat 5.7 is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a fractional sloop rig with a fully battened mainsail, a rotating mast and all-aluminum spars. The symmetrical hulls have raked stems, vertical transoms and transom-hung, kick-up rudders controlled by a tiller. The boat has a trampoline for the crew, with an optional second one forward of the mast that can be used as the base for a tent for overnight accommodation. The design has no centerboards or daggerboards, relying instead on deep \\"V\\"-shaped hulls with a rockered shape to prevent leeway. The boat displaces .

Also unusual is the trampoline forward of the mast, upon which an optional tent may be pitched for cruising, (To avoid pitch-poling, remove the forward trampoline in heavy weather.)

The Asiarchs were probably the annual representatives of the most important cities in the province, who presided over the provincial assembly (koinon) and had to organize and carry out the public games in honor of the gods and in the imperial cult at their expense. Asiarchs were based in the cities where this festival took place and where the temples of the gods concerned were located, for example Ephesus and Pergamon. They were elected by the cities and confirmed by the proconsul. Asiarchs are known from numerous inscriptions, but are also mentioned in Acts (19:31) and in the Martyrdom of Polycarp.Martyrdom of Polycarp, 12.2. In research, the identity of the Asiarchs with the \\"high priests of the (province) Asia\\" (archiereus tes Asias), whose ritual office is also linked to the imperial cult in selected cities in numerous inscriptions, is disputed. While most scholars take the traditional view that Asiarch and archiereus are two names for the same office, some researchers assume that the Asiarchs, unlike the high priests, held a local office.Karl Georg Brandis, \\"Asiarches\\", Realencyclop√§die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft Volume II.2 (Stuttgart, 1896), Sp. 1564-1578.

History The area covered by the square lay immediately outside the walls of Roman Eboracum and the Mediaeval York city walls, but within the walls of neighbouring St Mary's Abbey. By the 19th-century, the site was being used as a nursery by a Mr Bearpark. In 1833, the section of the city walls was demolished, to enable the construction of St Leonard's Place. An Art and Industrial Exhibition was held on Bootham, in York, in 1866, and in 1876 it was decided to hold a further exhibition. Bearpark's nursery was leased, while a house and the Bird in Hand pub were demolished, to clear the site. In 1879, Exhibition Square was built on the south-eastern part of the land, with the exhibition hall to its north-west, part of which survives as the York Art Gallery. The square is now the main location for the start of bus tours of the city, and also of walking tours run by the Association of Voluntary Guides to the City of York. Layout and architecture Looking north-east across the square The square lies to the west of the northernmost section of St Leonard's Place, where it meets Bootham. Bootham Bar, on the city walls, is opposite. On the north-eastern side of the square is part of the abbey boundary wall, including Bootham Tower and Queen Margaret's Arch, which leads to Bootham's junction with Gillygate. York Art Gallery lies on the north-western side, and King's Manor on the south-western side. The railings in front of King's Manor were originally built in 1726 for York Mansion House. In 1911, a statue of William Etty was placed in the centre of the square, to a design by G. W. Milburn. In 1971, the square was pedestrianised, and the York Civic Trust constructed a fountain in front of the statue of Etty.

Nicolas Poussin was a close friend of Duquesnoy, and the leading classicist painter in 17th-century French art, although he spent most of his working life in Rome. Both Poussin's and Duquesnoy's visions were at odds with the mainstream Baroque style of artists such as Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Pietro da Cortona. The portrait sculpture was completed in the 1630s, and is currently housed at the Bode Museum in Berlin. Sculpture Duquesnoy was a close friend of a number of prominent artists in Rome; among these was Poussin. The two artists even shared a house in 1626. Duquesnoy produced a small bust for Poussin, with details carefully worked out. The sitter has a melancholy face. The stylish rendering of moustache and beard and the composition itself are strongly reminiscent of Duquesnoy's Nano di Cr√©qui and his bust of Cardinal Maurizio of Savoy. The physiognomy and the surface of the sitter's skin are delicately rendered; delicacy and sensitivity contrast with the long, curvy hair framing the sitter's face.

It is to be constructed at a site to the west of Medora, North Dakota, near Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which preserves sites associated with Roosevelt's sojourn in North Dakota between 1883 and 1887. The project is in planning stages. A site in the Badlands of Medora was selected in 2020, as well as the lead design architect: Sn√∏hetta.  Design  Sn√∏hetta's vision for the interior of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library. A site was selected in March 2020 from eleven candidates on land owned by the U.S. Forest Service, about west of Medora, near the Burning Hills Amphitheater, and close to the Medora entrance to the south unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The site includes a section of the Maah Daah Hey Trail, and includes grassland and badland terrain. An initial field of forty architectural firms was narrowed to fourteen firms, which were all invited to compete to serve as the Design Architect for the library. Twelve firms participated and after a series of interviews & presentations, the Foundation announced three finalists: Sn√∏hetta, Studio Gang, and Henning Larsen. These three firms were provided stipends to develop design concepts. Sn√∏hetta‚Äìknown for its projects including the National September 11 Museum, Oslo Opera House, and Bibliotheca Alexandrina, among others‚Äìwas selected in September 2020 to design the library. Why North Dakota The Library is being built in North Dakota due in large part to both local and regional enthusiasm for the project, and Theodore Roosevelt's personal connections to the state. Theodore Roosevelt first came to the North Dakota badlands on September 8, 1883. Roosevelt arrived with the intent to hunt buffalo, but he subsequently formed a deeper connection with the land‚Äìso much so that he invested in two ranches in the area: the Maltese Cross and the Elkhorn. Roosevelt would return after the tragic deaths of both his wife, Alice, and mother, Mittie, on Valentine's Day in 1884. He sought refuge, healing, and strength in the landscape‚ÄìRoosevelt famously said the region is where the \\"romance of my life began.\\" Roosevelt would view his time in North Dakota fondly. He once said that if he was ever forced to retain just one memory from his life, he \\"would take the memory of my life on the ranch, with its experiences close to Nature and among the men who lived nearest her.\\" Moreover, Roosevelt would credit his time in the region as being formative to understanding not only himself, but the lives of others, famously declaring that he \\"never would have been President if it had not been for my experiences in North Dakota.\\" In 2019 the North Dakota Legislative Assembly authorized a $50 million operating endowment for the proposed library, to become available after $100 million had been raised for construction. Board and staff The Foundation includes Honorary Consul for Canada in North Dakota and former ND state budget director Rod Backman; American historian Dr. Stephen Dow Beckham; book reviewer and lecturer Marjorie Currey; President and CEO of the Arizona Science Center Chevy Humphrey; Robert Lauf III, former Senior Advisor to ND Governor Burgum; CEO and Chairwoman of Mountain Capital Linda Pancratz; e.Republic President Cathilea Robinett; Kermit Roosevelt III, professor at University of Pennsylvania Law School and great-great grandson of Theodore Roosevelt; North Dakota attorney and former North Dakota University System Chief of Staff Murray Sagsveen; North Dakota State University Foundation Board trustee Eileen Scheel; Political consultant and communications expert Serena Roosevelt; and Melani Walton. Former media executive Edward O'Keefe is the CEO.

He then began to teach himself piano by playing in public spaces at night, mostly in hotel lobbies. Knox did not sing until he was in his early twenties. Knox worked many odd jobs and eventually became a projectionist at Chicago‚Äôs Music Box Theatre. It was through the Music Box that Knox was selected by director David Lynch, who was touring with his film Inland Empire, to perform a piece of music alongside Lynch‚Äôs screening in 2007. Knox played an original piece on the theater‚Äôs organ as an overture while Lynch read a poem. In 2007, Knox was invited by art director David Coulter to perform at the Barbican Center alongside musicians including Rufus Wainwright, the Handsome Family and Damon Albarn.

His lyrics are described as dark and witty, and he has been compared to Randy Newman in his ‚Äúrefreshingly mean-spirited‚Äù songs. Knox has also been compared to Harry Nilsson, Scott Walker and Tom Waits. His musical style is eclectic, with descriptions ranging from jazz to cabaret to operatic pop, and he is also noted for a cinematic style in his songs. His musical delivery has been described as the ‚ÄúMidwestern sensibility of edginess meets kindness.‚Äù In reference to his songwriting, Knox has been labelled a ‚Äúmaster storyteller.‚Äù = Influences = Knox has cited Judy Garland, Al Jolson and Maurice Chevalier as early musical influences.

It lies on Church Street, near St Sampson's Square. The church lies across the line of the wall of Roman Eboracum, and the first church on the site was probably built before the Norman Conquest, as a fragment of an early 11th-century cross has been found in the wall of a house on Newgate, within the former churchyard. Foundations of a Norman wall have also been discovered underneath the present church. The church was first recorded in the 1154, and from 1394 the advowson belonged to the Vicars Choral of York Minster. It is dedicated to Saint Sampson of York, the only church in England with this dedication. The church, seen from St Sampson's Square The church was gradually rebuilt in the 15th-century, the south aisle being rebuilt in the 1400s, and the north aisle dating in the 1440s, while the west tower was rebuilt in the 1480s. In the 1549, there was a plan to merge the parish with that of St Helen, Stonegate, and although this did not happen, St Sampson did gain two bell from St Helen. In 1644, the tower was damaged during the English Civil War, and the Parliamentarian troops subsequently destroyed most of the monuments in the church. Between 1845 and 1848, most of the church was rebuilt by Frederick Bell, and a vestry was added. The tower survived, but was reduced in height, being heightened again in 1910. Other pre-Victorian elements of the church include the east window of the north aisle, some roof bosses, the bell-frame and bells, the north and south doors, the piscina, and various monuments. In 1969, the church closed, and many of its fittings were removed. However, it was restored by George Pace, and in 1974 it reopened as a centre for the elderly. He inserted a mezzanine floor over the north aisle, to give space for offices, and placed a kitchen in the south aisle. The sanctuary was converted into a chapel, with a reredos from All Saints, Falsgrove. The church was listed as Grade II in June 1954.

However, when asked about his genre, he said, > \\"I don't belong to any genre, that's putting labels on art. I believe art is > formless and the best way to express yourself. I've always been a rapper but > now I produce my own music. I produced \\"Parte After Parte\\" myself. Since I > started production, I don't want to box myself into any genre. I'm a vibes > creator.

It was bound for Pulkovo Airport in Leningrad, a distance of . Roughly two hours into the flight, the engines lost power. Some sources state that this was due to an accidental shutoff of fuel pumping to the aircraft's sump tank by the flight engineer, though the accuracy of this claim is uncertain. Due to the poor design of the Tu-154B, a single fuel pump failure could result in the stoppage of all three engines. Soon after the engines lost power, the aircraft's AC generators stopped. This resulted in an abrupt pitch and roll of the aircraft, the first sign of malfunction that the pilots noticed. During descent, the pilots tried multiple times to restart the engines. Some of these attempts worked, but did not supply enough power to the generators to restart the fuel pump. The pilots also attempted to use the aircraft's APU to restart the fuel pump, but its operation was disabled by design at altitudes above . The aircraft landed in a potato and barley field southeast of Maksatikha at 1:32 p.m. The aircraft bounced several times, separating into three pieces upon contact with trees. Two to three minutes after stopping, the aircraft's fuselage caught on fire and was destroyed. Four people died in the incident and 27 were injured.

On the surface, the K6s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with four internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single AA guns.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 124 Construction and commissioning Ro-37 was laid down as Submarine No. 203 on 9 October 1941 by the Sasebo Navy Yard at Sasebo, Japan. She was renamed Ro-37 on 20 June 1942, and was provisionally attached to the Maizuru Naval District that day. She was launched on 30 June 1942 and completed and commissioned a year later on 30 June 1943. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-37 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. On 16 September 1943 she was reassigned directly to 6th Fleet headquarters, and she departed Maizuru bound for Truk on 22 September 1943. During her voyage, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 1 in the 6th Fleet on 24 September 1943. She arrived at Truk on 7 October 1943. =First war patrol= Ro-37 got underway from Truk on 20 October 1943 to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area east of the New Hebrides as part of Submarine Group A. While at sea, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 on 31 October 1943, but otherwise her patrol was uneventful. She returned to Truk in November 1943. =Second war patrol= During the second half of December 1943, Ro-37 took aboard supplies from the auxiliary submarine tender at Truk. On 2 January 1944, Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL), an Allied signals intelligence unit headquartered at Melbourne, Australia, reported that a Japanese message transmitted from Truk that FRUMEL had intercepted and decrypted said that Ro-37 was scheduled to depart Truk Lagoon via the South Channel at 16:00 on 3 January 1944 and proceed east-southeast on a course of 116 degrees. As FRUMEL had reported, Ro-37 got underway from Truk on 3 January 1944 on her second war patrol, bound for a patrol area off the New Hebrides. The Japanese never heard from her again. =Loss= Ro-37 was southeast of San Cristobal in the Solomon Islands on 22 January 1944 when she sighted the United States Navy fleet oiler , which was on a voyage to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides in company with the destroyer minesweeper . She hit Cache in the port side with one torpedo at . The explosion opened holes in three of Cache‚Ä≤s oil tanks, damaged other tanks, and blew two men overboard, killing one of them. Southard rescued the other man from the water. Meanwhile, Cache transmitted a distress signal, which the destroyer ‚Äî which was on a voyage from Purvis Bay to Espiritu Santo ‚Äî received. Buchanan put on flank speed to go to Cache‚Ä≤s assistance. Buchanan made radar contact at a range of with what her commanding officer described as a \\"fairly large\\" submarine on the surface east-southeast of San Cristobal and northwest of where Ro-37 had torpedoed Cache. After closing to a range of , Buchanan illuminated Ro-37 with a searchlight in time to see her submerge. Buchanan then detected Ro-37 on sonar at a range of . Buchanan dropped 53 depth charges over the next three hours and finally sank Ro-37 at . Buchanan‚Ä≤s crew observed an oil slick covering on the surface, and the following morning a large amount of wooden and cork debris was seen floating in the vicinity of the sinking. On 17 February 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared Ro-37 to be presumed lost in the New Hebrides area with all 61 hands. She was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1944.

This happened late into rehearsals in March 1739.Wilson p.175 The original cast was intended to feature Dennis Delane as Edward, Christiana Horton as Eleanor, James Rosco as Gloucester and Lacy Ryan as the Sultan. Thomson was closely identified with the Patriot Whigs opposed to the government of Robert Walpole. His play, ostensibly about Edward I and his wife Eleanor during the Ninth Crusade, was viewed as an attack on Walpole's policies and personal corruption.Wilson p.175 Because the play begins with Edward as a patriotic Prince of Wales compared favourably to his father Henry III, similarities were drawn with the strained relationship between George II and his son Frederick, Prince of Wales who was a backer of the Patriot Whigs.Wilson p.177 Thomson dedicated the published version of the play to Frederick's wife Augusta. The play finally premiered at Covent Garden on 18 March 1775, many years after Thomson's death. The cast included Thomas Hull, Robert Bensley, Ann Street Barry and Isabella Mattocks.

The company, though specialising in the conversion and redevelopment of listed heritage buildings, also engages in the construction of new-build property and acquisitions. Rushbond is the owner of a number of landmark buildings within Leeds, including the Corn Exchange, Majestic Cinema, and First White Cloth Hall, as well as Bretton Hall, Wakefield, St Leonard's Place, York and Centenary Square, Bradford. Considered within the industry to have a focus on creativity and design quality, Rushbond also involves itself in corporate social responsibility supporting a variety of community initiatives, partnering particularly with Meanwood Valley Urban Farm, and contributes to public art, funding projects such as Ian Randall's Steeped Vessels (2006) at Brewery Wharf, and Tim Etchells's neon artwork Where the Heart Is (2014), located on the Algernon Firth student residential building. History The entrepreneur Jonathan Maud incorporated the company on 8 July 1986 and remains its managing director and sole owner. Maud appeared in the 2009 Sunday Times Rich List ranked at #1,771 (#1,794 in 2008) with a worth of ¬£30M (¬£40M in 2008), and was named at 82nd in the Yorkshire Rich List in 2017, with wealth risen to ¬£67M. In 2014, Rushbond established an arts scholarship programme with Leeds Beckett University, known as the Rushbond Arts Scholarship. It is donated annually to School of Art, Architecture and Design undergraduates to support their early careers. One of Rushbond's buildings, the former Majestic Cinema on City Square, gained prominence after being gutted during a large fire in September 2014, just after the completion of works to restore and convert it into mixed leisure and retail use. A scheme to construct a new interior of high-quality office space and additional floors began in 2018, with the building becoming the new national headquarters of Channel 4 in 2021.

Early Iberian documentary sources, such as the Estoria de Espa√±a, refer to their use by the Moors (Moros). From about 1500 onwards a fleet of zabras developed in the coastal trade of Cantabria on the Cantabrian Sea, and fishermen began using them to exploit the fisheries of Ireland and North America. These zabras were fast, square-rigged row-sailers with two masts; they were rowed with 14 to 18 oars and had a tonnage of between 20 and 60 tons. Their ratio of beam to length was 1: 3.75‚Äì4.0. The smallest zabras had only a half deck or a poop deck, but the larger ones were covered with a flush deck. Because of their excellent handling qualities, and despite their modest size, they were frequently used by the Crown of Castile for the transport of money and soldiers to Flanders, as well as in transatlantic voyages. Zabras were used for exploration, reconnaissance and the dispatch of messages, and also for guarding the coasts and landfall areas that were of interest to the Crown and its overseas empire. Zabras were navigated and maneuvered under sail, and earlier versions could be rowed by oarsmen as well. They were armed for both commerce and warfare. Although designed for use in the Cantabrian Sea, zabras were used in the Mediterranean Sea for the Spanish Naples campaigns in the Italian Wars of 1495 and 1500, and in 1534 against the Barbary pirate, Barbarossa, who was now admiral of the Ottoman fleet. Zabras made the transatlantic crossing between America and Spain in 30 days or less and could transport an average of about 100 tons of cargo in their holds. These two characteristics, speed and load capacity, in addition to their armaments, made them ideal substitutes for the ships of the Spanish West Indies Fleets (Flotas de Indias), i.e., the Spanish treasure fleets, when those ships could not make the annual crossing due to lack of time, danger of enemy attacks or some other cause. Characteristics Similar in shape to a brigantine, the zabra was square-rigged with a lateen mizzen sail and had six banks of rowers. While sails were necessary for crossing the Atlantic and traveling long distances, oars allowed for better maneuverability in the absence of wind, for ascending rivers, or for quickly escaping combat in shallow waters. They also allowed the main ship of an expedition to remain at a discrete distance offshore while the smaller ship reconnoitered an enemy port. Zabras often functioned as courier vessels and provided logistical support to the fleets as well. Several dozen zabras were used in postal and commercial traffic on the Bay of Biscay under the patronage of the Spanish Admiralty (Almirantazgo). Zabras evolved under the influence of galleon design, becoming stouter, with the forecastle removed and leaving a beakhead forward; the sides began to be covered with sentry boxes, the redoubts forward and aftward were fortified, and the hull lines further refined. Their tonnage increased, reaching 600 tons, and their guns and crew were increased as well. With a usual gross tonnage of between 80 and 170 tons, zebras had elongated and flat hulls with fine lines, a marked sheer and a pronounced tumblehome that made the beam at deck-level much narrower than at the waterline.

Zabras had full square rigging with a sprit-sail on the bowsprit yard, foresails or foretopsails on the foremast, mainsails and topsails on the mainmast, and a lateen sail on the mizzen yard. They were very suitable for mail runs, reconnaissance and exploration missions; zabras typically mounted 10 guns and the crew usually did not exceed 60 men. Examples Santiago, the largest zabra of the thirteen assembled for the Spanish Armada in 1588, mounted 19 guns and carried a crew of 40 sailors and 60 soldiers. Julia was the smallest zabra of the Armada, along with Augusta. Julia bore 14 pieces, was crewed by 72 mariners, and had 44 soldiers on board.

Humboldt University was not the organizer of the lecture. The activists expressed accusations against Israel and Lavie, including accusations of war crimes and apartheid. The activists were then removed from the lecture hall. On August 3, 2020, a Berlin court sentenced Stavit Sinai, one of the BDS activists, to a 450 euro fine for assault, related to the fact that she pounded on the door of the lecture hall, which reportedly caused injuries to two people. Her fellow activists claimed Sinai had been punched in the face while being ejected from the lecture hall, and tried to get back in to find out the identity of the person who had hit her. Two other BDS activists charged in relation to the incident, Ronnie Barkan and Majed Abusalama, were found not guilty. The conviction of Stavit Sinai for assault (pounding on the door) was used as an argument for calling BDS a violent movement. Incident Aliza Lavie, Member of Knesset On June 20, 2017, an event was taking place in one of the lecture halls at Humboldt University in Berlin. The organizers were DIG (die Deutsch- Israelische Gesellschaft) and Mideast Freedom Forum Berlin (the executive director of which is also a DIG member) The event took place in English. The title of the event was Leben in Israel - Terror, Voreingenommenheit und die Chancen f√ºr eine Friedensl√∂sung (Life in Israel - Terror, Bias and the Chances for Peace). The announcement of the event also mentioned BDS and their \\"questionable\\" purpose (boycott of Israel). It was advertised as lecture and discussion with Aliza Lavie, Knesset MP, Yesh Atid, Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense, and members of the delegation of Yesh Atid and Young Yesh Atid. Aliza Lavie was also the chair of the Knesset Caucus for the Struggle Against the Delegitimization of the State of Israel; one BDS activist characterized her as the \\"chair of anti-BDS lobby\\". Besides members of Yesh Atid and the party's youth organization, an 82-year-old Holocaust survivor, Dvora Weinstein, was also present (she was not speaking, at least at the time of the incident).Dvora Weinstein, or any participants being Holocaust survivors, were not mentioned in the announcement of the event. The announcement did however mention that Aliza Lavie and members of Young Yesh Atid will talk about how Israel was created after the Holocaust. Among the audience were at least three BDS activists: Stavit Sinai (an Israeli Jewish university lecturer), Ronnie Barkan (an Israeli Jewish math teacher) and Majed Abusalama (a Gaza Palestinian born in the Jabalia refugee camp, shot in a leg by an Israeli soldier during a nonviolent protest). According to Michael Spaney from DIG, \\"several minutes\\" or \\"about 10 minutes\\" into Aliza Lavie's lecture, one of the activists started shouting at her before being removed from the hall, and then two others started speaking and/or shouting against Lavie and against Israel before being removed too. The activists were accusing Israel of apartheid and accusing Israel, and Aliza Lavie specifically, of war crimes in Gaza. Lavie said the activists told her \\"the blood of the Gaza Strip is on your hands\\" and called the politician a \\"child murderer\\" (a reference to the 2014 bombardment and airstrikes in Gaza). Lavie and her group reportedly left the hall through a back exit to avoid a group of about 20 protesters at the main entrance. Describing the way the activists were removed from the hall by DIG members, Michael Spaney from DIG said they were \\"nicely maneuvered out\\" of the hall (though they were \\"lashing out\\"), while the BDS activists said Stavit Sinai was punched in the face. Ronnie Barkan said that a video shown to the judge during the trial showed the moment Sinai was punched. Criminal proceedings The Berlin branch of DIG filed a criminal complaint against the three BDS activists. The complaint says the BDS activists launched tirades exceeding their permitted speaking time and interrupted Lavie's talk. The compaint also alleges Stavit Sinai \\"swung [her fists] wildly around her and attendees\\" as she was escorted from the university room for disrupting the event; and that she \\"continuously attempted to reenter the lecture hall and pounded on the door\\", and that a member of DIG positioned himself by the door to block her reentry. In August 2017, the spokesman for Humboldt University told the press that the university had filed a criminal complaint as early as June 27, following the DIG complaint from June 26. After more than three years, on August 3, 2020, the court dismissed the trespassing charges. Barkan and Abusalama were acquitted of all charges; however, Sinai was found guilty of assault because of her pounding on the door of the lecture hall, which reportedly caused injuries to two people, and sentenced to a fine of 450 euro. Barkan and Abusalama said Sinai was trying to reenter the hall to find out the identity of the person who had punched her in the face. Reactions =Media= The day after the verdict, Berliner Zeitung published an article titled Disgusting hatred of Jews in and in front of the Berlin courtroom (Widerlicher Judenhass in und vor Berliner Gerichtssaal). The article portrayed the lecture disruption as \\"sheer hatred of Jews\\" and the entire 2017 event as an \\"event with a Holocaust survivor\\". Aliza Lavie was not mentioned. In the article, Stavit Sinai was referred to as \\"Stavit S.\\", Ronnie Barkan as \\"Ronnie B.\\" and Majed Abusalama as \\"Majed A.\\", and faces of all three were shown with censor bars over their eyes. Ronnie Barkan was described as \\"Slovak, according to his own information also in possession of Israeli citizenship\\" and Stavit Sinai as \\"Romanian, allegedly also an Israeli citizen\\" (in fact both of them are Israeli Jews). The Jerusalem Post followed suit with an article titled BDS ‚ÄòJew-hater‚Äô convicted for violent assault in Germany. The article reads: \\"A Berlin court convicted on Monday a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions activist for assaulting people during a presentation by an Israeli survivor of the Holocaust at Humboldt University in the capital\\". The article continues to say, \\"In a dramatic setback to the claim of the BDS campaign that it is a nonviolent initiative targeting the Jewish state, the Berlin court declared Stavit Sinai guilty for her violent conduct\\". =Officials= Uwe Becker, who is the Hesse commisioner to combat antisemitism and also the mayor of Frankfurt, praised the conviction of Sinai as \\"an important success against the violent character of BDS and its supporters\\". \\"It unmasks the violent character of the BDS movement, because it shows that even Holocaust survivors are attacked by BDS when they speak out for the Jewish state\\", said Becker (the Holocaust survivor was neither attacked nor criticized during the incident).

It was conveyed when they deeded Manchonat, an Island between the north and south fork in exchange for goods and alliance.

The Montauk Tribe of Indians were tributary or allied to the Pequots, their enemies. Pequot War Resting place of Sachem Poggatacut, also known as Sachem's hole The end of the Pequot war (1636-38) saw the Pequots decimated as the toll of contact with the Europeans via the fur trade and superior numbers of Narragansetts ended their dominance on Long Island. With the Narragansetts set to eradicate the Montaukett tribe, Poggatacut sought to ally with the settlers and Gardiner. By 1648 he was Sachem of Shelter Island and travelled from his residence on Sachem‚Äôs Neck to visit with the other tribes. It was on one of these visits that he died in 1651. His funeral train bore his body back to Montauk and stopped at Buc-Usk- Kil,https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=148091 a place on the road from Sag Harbor to East Hampton. Indian lore has that where his head rested there was a shallow hole in the ground, approximately 1 1/2 feet deep, later called the Sachem's hole,https://jeremynative.com/onthissite/listing/sachems-hole/ which for passing Indians became a sacred place. For 200 years passing tribes would stop and remove the twigs and leaves that had fallen into the hole; until the 1950s when the roadway (E Hampton-Sag Harbor turnpike/ NY 114) was widened and the sachems hole obliterated. By 1663 East Hampton had passed laws prohibiting Indians from the town due to the smallpox plague that ravished the Montauketts. Grand sachem Wyandanch had united 13 tribes and moved the tribe off the Indian fields to gain the safety that being closer to the whites entailed.

Running since 2014, it follows the adventures of five women new to university who become magical girls and must protect this world and as well as another dimension. Agents of the Realm was shortlisted for a Cartoonist Studio Prize in the category \\"Best Web Comic\\" of 2017. Synopsis The story of Agents of the Realm follows five young women ‚Äì Norah, Adele, Kendall, Paige and Jordan ‚Äì who are starting college at the fictional Silvermount University. After each discovering brooches that allow them to summon weapons and outfits, they discover they are magical warriors that are destined to defend two different dimensions, connected by a rift at the university. Once, a powerful gem maintained balance between the two worlds, but in a power struggle, it was shattered and became the amulets the main characters now have, and are linked to similarly powered people in the other dimension. The main characters are mentored by Jade Blackwater, who hides information from them. They must also contend with Jade's twin sister, Ruby, who teaches mythology at the university and who has villainous intentions. Initially Jordan is recruited by Ruby, and is convinced that Jade is evil. These young women are trapped by fate and struggling with duty and personal lives, including university, friendships, and relationships. The webcomic is a magical girl story inspired by series such as Sailor Moon and Magic Knight Rayearth. The main cast of five is predominantly Black, with one Latina woman and one white woman, and these characters have a variety of sexual orientations. Agents of the Realm covers issues such as alcoholism, domestic abuse, and self-harm. Volume 1 of the comic introduces the characters and reveals their powers and the conflict they find themselves a part of, while Volume 2 explores the relationship between their mentor and their mentor‚Äôs estranged sister, and the problems caused by the group's enemy. Development The webcomic is created by Mildred Louis and launched in 2014. In an interview, Louis said that the webcomic started as a joke idea, playing around with the magical girl genre. Louis describes Agents of the Realm as influenced by magical girl stories she grew up with, such as Sailor Moon, as well as her experiences in college. As a black woman, Louis was disappointed not to see characters that look like her in genres that she likes, and used the webcomic \\"as my chance to unapologetically put them at the forefront and show that we, too, can be heroes.\\" Similarly, she wanted to diversify queer content to include more women of color. In 2016, Louis successfully held a Kickstarter campaign to publish volume 1 of the comic in print She successfully ran a second Kickstarter in 2018 to release volume 2 of the comic as well as a \\"remastered\\" version of volume 1. The webcomic previously updated twice a week, but since June 2020 it has been on hiatus. Louis posted in September 2020 that she could not say when the webcomic would resume. Reception Agents of the Realm was shortlisted for the Cartoonist Studio Prize in the category \\"Best Web Comic\\" of 2017. A 2016 ComicsAlliance article said the comic has \\"a growing legion of fans since it started almost two years ago\\" and that Agents of the Realm is \\"a profoundly real story, with women who experience life in all its ups and downs\\". Articles on the A.V. Club described the webcomic as \\"balanc[ing] fantastic story elements with rich character development\\" and as having \\"the ability to create [a story] starring very different women with more ethical quandaries and powerful contradictions than the average comic tackles in a decade,\\" the latter article declaring it one of the best comics of 2016. Paste Magazine also declared it one of \\"40 of the best webcomics\\" in 2016; a Paste Magazine review praised Louis's \\"vibrant colors, expressive faces and excellent comedic timing\\". Describing the art style, a reviewer for CBR said, \\"Mildred Louis' Agents of the Realm doesn't, at a glance, look like it was inspired by manga. Her style bears more similarity to the Hernandez brothers than to the dewy-eyed teens who populate most shoujo titles. The characters don't look like elegant models, but rather like harried, exhausted college students.\\" A reviewer for Autostraddle added, \\"Louis can draw exasperated, exhausted and annoyed faces better than just about anyone on the internet.\\" References External links * Category:2010s webcomics Category:2014 webcomic debuts Category:American webcomics Category:Comics about women Category:Fantasy webcomics Category:LGBT-related webcomics Category:Magical girl comics Category:School webcomics Category:Webcomics in print ","title":"Agents of the Realm"},{"id":"65375507","text":"La Parapluie fantastique, known in English as Ten Ladies in One Umbrella, Ten Girls in One Umbrella, and Ten Ladies in an Umbrella, is a 1903 French short silent film by Georges M√©li√®s.

The upper plains of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers dominate most of the ecoregion. The terrain is mostly open shrub steppe. The climate is arid (less than 250 mm of precipitation per year). Evidence is that this region was once more of a forest-steppe, but centuries of overgrazing and gathering firewood have reduced tree and grass cover to small areas and along the riverine corridors. Despite the degraded condition of the steppe environment, the ecoregion is important for water birds as the rivers and reservoirs provide habitat in the arid region.  Location and description  Most of the ecoregion is in upper Syria and Iraq, with a thin extension through western Jordan that almost reaches the Gulf of Aqaba in the south, and almost touching the border with Iran in the east. The terrain is flat plains or hills, with an average elevation is .. The ecoregion to the south is the Mesopotamian shrub desert, and to the north is the Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests ecoregion.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Hot semi-arid climates (K√∂ppen climate classification (BSh)). This climate is characteristic of steppes, with hot summers and cool or mild winters, and minimal precipitation. The coldest month averages above . Precipitation averages less than 200 mm/year.  Flora and fauna  The region is one of shrub steppe, crossed by riverine woodlands in places. In deep, non-saline soils the dominant shrubs are white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba), associated with bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa). Stonier soils support Hammada scoparia. Areas near water support (Tamarix), Euphrates poplar (Populus euphratica), and reeds (Phragmites). In less populated areas with vegetation, some large mammals are found, including the European badger (Meles meles), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and the vulnerable Arabian goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). For migratory water birds, the Euphrates River valley serves as a major migration route between the wetlands of Turkey and the wetlands of Iraq. Many of these species depend on a combination of wetlands and arid desert habitat. Birds in the ecoregion of conservation interest include vulnerable Houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata), the vulnerable Great bustard (Otis tarda), and the near-threatened Little bustard (Tetrax tetrax).  Protected areas  Less than 1% of the ecoregion is officially protected. These protected areas include: * Wujib Nature Reserve (Jordan) * Dana Biosphere Reserve (Jordan) * Fifa_Nature_Reserve (Jordan)  References  Category:Palearctic ecoregions Category:Ecoregions of Jordan Category:Ecoregions of Syria Category:Ecoregions of Iraq ","title":"Middle East steppe"},{"id":"65375739","text":"Jennifer Anne Gregory (born 1946) is an Australian academic and historian.

He acquired the status of a mujtahid in the field of fiqh and usul al-fiqh. The contemporary muhaddithun (hadith specialists) also considered him as their Imam. Likewise, he was respected and enjoyed a high status among the mutakallimun (practitioners of kalam) and Sufis. He was closely associated with the eminent Sufis of his time like Abu Nasr ibn al-Qushayri (d. 514/1120), the son of al-Qushayri (d. 465/1072). Abu Bakr al-Shashi said: \\"Abu Ishaq is Allah's proof on the leading scholars of the time.\\" Al-Muwaffaq al- Hanafi said: \\"Abu Ishaq is the Amir al-Mu'minin (Prince of the Believers) from among the fuqaha' (jurists).\\" The Azhari scholar 'Ali Jum'a, an inheritor of al-Bajuri's teachings, calls him the \\"shaykh of the fuqnha' of his era.\\"  Name  He is Shaykh al-Islam, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim b.

Teachers  He studied under various Shafi'i masters in Shiraz and Basra before coming to Baghdad. In Shiraz, he studied under Abu 'Abd Allah al-Baydawi and 'Abd al- Wahhab ibn Ramin. In Basrah, he had al-Kharzi for master. In 415 AH (1024-1025 AD), he entered Baghdad to study under Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari.  Students  He had many students, the most famous of whom are: Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, al- Hariri of Basra, Ibn 'Aqil, Abu al-Walid al-Baji, Fakhr al-Islam Abu Bakr al- Shashi al-Qaffal (d. 507/1113), and Abu al-Qasim ibn al-Samarqandi al-Dimashqi (d. 536/1142).  Works  He authored many works, among the most famous of them are: * Al-Tanbih fi al-Fiqh al-Shafi'i (), one of the five most important books in Shafi'i jurisprudence, played a prominent role in the development of the Shafi'i school. Al-Nawawi wrote a commentary on it called Tashih al- Tanbih, as well as two other commentaries by Ibn al-Rif'a (d. 710/1310) and al-Zarkashi (d. 794/1392). * (), a comprehensive manual of Islamic law according to the Shafi'i school, which took him fourteen years to produce, and which was later on explained by the Shafi'i hadith scholar al-Nawawi naming it al-Majm≈´' Sharh al-Muhadhdhab (), was a recension and compilation of all the strands of Shafi'i jurisprudence. These two works are counted among the five key reference texts for the Shafi'i school, and the Muhadhdhab was considered by al-Nawawi to be one of the two most important works of this school ever produced. * (), one of the earliest works in relation to Usul al-Fiqh specifically in the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence. This work was contemporaneous to major developments in post-Shafi'i usul, such as the writings of al-Juwayni, with whom he apparently differed on a number of points. * (), a summary of Ash'ari creed with kalam proofs. * (), gives the lives of the jurists among the Sahaba (companions of the Prophet), and the Tabi'in (followers of the companions of the Prophet) and those of the founders of schools and their disciples. * (), a book in 'ilm al-khilƒÅf (the science of juridical disagreement). * Al-Ma'una fi al-Jadal ().  Death  He died in Baghdad in 476 AH (1083‚Äì1084 AD), and the 'Abbasid caliph al-Muqtadi (d. 487/1094) attended his funeral. On his death, his pupils sat in solemn mourning in the NizƒÅmiya college, and after that ceremony, Muwyyad al-Mulk, son of Nizam al-Mulk, appointed Abu Sa'd al-Mutwalli to the vacant place, but when NizƒÅm al-Mulk heard of it, he wrote to disapprove of that nomination, adding that the college should be shut up during a year, on account of Abu Ishaq's death; he then blamed the person who had undertaken to fill his place, and ordered the sheikh Abu Nasr ibn al-Sabbagh to profess in his stead.

The World Health Organization officially launched the book on April 9, 2020. The book is freely available and can be accessed online.  Background  The project was supported by global, regional and country-based experts from Member Agencies of the IASC MHPSS RG, in addition to parents, caregivers, teachers and children in 104 countries. A global survey was distributed in Arabic, English, Italian, French and Spanish to assess children's mental health and psychosocial needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. A framework of topics to be addressed through the story was developed using the survey results. The book was shared through storytelling to children in several countries affected by COVID-19. Feedback from children, parents and caregivers was then used to review and update the story. Over 1,700 children, parents, caregivers and teachers worldwide provided input by sharing how they were coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. Translations and adaptations To date, more than 120 languages translations are published online.

He is a Professor of Curriculum, Teaching and Learning at Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) at University of Toronto. Miller‚Äôs work is focused on holistic education, curriculum and spirituality. He is an author of over 20 books including, Whole Child Education, Education and Soul and Educating for Wisdom and Compassion, among others. He is also a lead editor of the book, International Handbook of Holistic Education. Miller‚Äôs work has been translated into eight languages. In 2009, Miller was one of 24 educators invited to Bhutan for the orientation of Bhutan‚Äôs educational system towards the goal of Gross National Happiness. His book The Holistic Curriculum has been used as a basis for curriculum framework for the Whole Child School in Toronto.  Education  Miller completed his Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Economics from University of Missouri in 1965 and his Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree in Education from Harvard University in 1967. Miller moved from USA to Canada and completed his Doctoral studies in Curriculum from University of Toronto in 1971.  Career  Miller initiated his career in academics in 1965 as a History teacher at a High School in New York. During his Bachelors and Masters studies, he had brief stints as Resident Advisor at Grinnell College and as Instructor in Education at the University of Missouri at Kansas City. After moving from USA to Canada, he joined OISE of University of Toronto as a Graduate Assistant of Curriculum during his Doctoral studies. At the institute, he was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1972 and to Associate Professor in 1978. In 1986, he was appointed as Professor at the department of Curriculum, Teaching and Learning, at OISE. Miller also held administrative positions at OISE. He served as a Project Director in 1972 and then was appointed as Head of Northwestern Centre from 1978 till 1983. For the subsequent thirteen years, he headed the Niagara Centre. During this tenure, he also served as the Division Head of Field Centers and Coordinator Off- Campus Programming. From 1996 till 2003, Miller served as Head of Southern Centre and as Head of Centre for Teacher Development from 2003 till 2007. Miller has also taught as a visiting faculty at universities in Japan and Hong Kong, such as Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Education University of Hong Kong and Kobe Shinwa Women's University in Japan.  Research and work  Miller‚Äôs work is divided into four main areas of research including holistic education, contemplative education, spirituality in education and the orientations to curriculum. =Holistic Education= Miller has dedicated a significant portion of his research to the field of holistic education which is related to educating the whole child. His books, Whole Child Education, Teaching from the Thinking Heart: The Practice of Holistic Education and The Holistic Curriculum, represent his work on holistic education. Miller is also a co-editor of a book series with Information Age Publishing entitled Current Perspectives in Holistic Education. In 1990, Miller co-authored Holistic Learning: A Teacher's Guide to Integrated Studies. This book provided strategies to apply transformational approaches for the integration of curriculum. Miller explained the key elements for improving the academic ability and performance of children as well as for using holistic learning to educate the whole child. He highlighted concepts such as balance, inclusion and connection in the context of holistic learning. Miller also conducted research on holistic curriculum and discussed its key instances as alternatives to national curriculum published in the Oxford Encyclopedia of Education. He explained in detail the concept of the holistic approach in education along with the main principles of holistic education. Miller also highlighted the six core connections of a holistic curriculum. In the mid-2010s, he conducted a qualitative study of Equinox Holistic Alternative School and interviewed various stakeholders of the school. His research indicated that the school was successful in achieving its goal of whole child education. In 2009, Miller was invited to Bhutan as one of the 24 educators for the orientation of Bhutan‚Äôs educational system towards the goal of Gross National Happiness. He wrote about his visit to Bhutan and described the work performed and the outcomes of the workshop attended in the country. =Contemplative Education= Miller also worked on contemplative education, which focuses on the use of various forms of contemplation, such as meditation and mindfulness practice, in educational settings. His work on contemplative education is explained in the book, The Contemplative Practitioner: Meditation in Education and the Workplace. In his research about contemplative practice in education and teacher development, Miller pointed out dualism as the major problem in applying contemplative studies in the universities. He explained the non-dualistic framework that allows for self integration. Miller worked on introducing contemplative studies to a graduate school and described the students‚Äô experiences with various forms of meditation. Miller researched on the impact of meditation practice on teachers and found that the teachers who were involved with meditation practice in their graduate program, continued practicing meditation even after the completion of the program. Miller authored an article about the teachers‚Äô self-reflection of their practices in context of contemplative studies. He discussed the three levels of practice in terms of a nesting concept. He also discussed the reflect-in-action approach for teachers in comparison with a contemplative approach. =Spirituality in Education= Miller researched on spirituality in education and explored concepts such as spirit and soul and investigated how these concepts could be nourished in educational settings. His work on spirituality in education can be best represented by his books, Education and the Soul and Educating for Wisdom and Compassion: Creating Conditions for Timeless Learning. Miller studied the work of Bronson Alcott in pioneering spiritual education. He discussed Alcott‚Äôs devotion to improve children‚Äôs spirituality in the context of education and described his work as an educator. Miller also explained the relevance and application of Alcott‚Äôs ideas in the present field of spirituality in education. =Orientations to Curriculum= Miller has also worked on different orientations and approaches towards curriculum, teaching and learning. His research is explained in his books, The Educational Spectrum: Orientations to Curriculum and Curriculum: Perspectives and Practice. In these works he outlines the concepts of Transmission, Transaction and Transformation as basic approaches to teaching and learning and their relationship to curriculum development implementation and evaluation.

Biography  He was born into the family of a factory owner. After completing his primary education in Eisenach, he studied political science at the University of Jena, but did not graduate. Then, attempting to follow his father's wishes and go into business, he went to Munich for lessons in brewing, but found it to be of little interest. During this time, he learned to speak English, French and Spanish. In 1857, he finally completed his doctorate in Jena. His parents were wealthy, so he began traveling at an early age. He made his first overseas trip in 1846, visiting New York City, Boston and other places in North America. His experiences with German immigrants there inspired him to become interested in reforming the emigration process. Further trips took him to Spain, Istanbul, Madeira, Anatolia, Jordan and Lesbos. After each of his travels, he would publish thoroughly researched accounts, often in several volumes, which included cultural, economic, historical and geographic information.Lotar K√∂llner: Bedeutende Ruhlaer aus vier Jahrhunderten vorgestellt von Lotar K√∂llner (= Beitr√§ge zur Ruhlaer Heimatgeschichte. 7). L√∂hr, Ruhla 2005, His travels paused for only a brief time, during the Franco-Prussian War, when he devoted himself to caring for wounded soldiers. Ruhla remained his base of operations and he became involved in numerous civic affairs, including a railway extension, improving the schools, building libraries, and creating a foundation to care for the elderly. His work earned him numerous awards and honors. In 1861, Charles Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach named him a Hofrat and, in 1867, he received the Knight's Cross of the Order of the White Falcon from William I, the King of Prussia. He died while staying at the spa in Wiesbaden.  Publications (selection)  *Skizzen einer Reise durch Nordamerika und Westindien mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung des Staates Wisconsin.

History  Prior to 2020, some individual medieval adaptations of popular music had gained attention on YouTube, such as LjB0's Halo Theme remix and Algal the Bard's version of System of a Down's \\"Toxicity\\" which attracted millions of listeners after it was published in December 2017. However, The Guardian dates the origin of bardcore as a distinct trend to 20 April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, when 27-year-old German YouTuber Cornelius Link released \\"Astronomia (Medieval Style)\\". The track is a remake of Tony Igy's 2010 electronic dance track \\"Astronomia\\", which had gained widespread attention as the soundtrack to the coffin dance meme. Link followed this a few weeks later with a medieval-style instrumental version of Foster the People's \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", which Canadian YouTuber Hildegard von Blingin' (a play on the name of the medieval composer Hildegard von Bingen) then re-released with an added vocal track using a medieval-style adaptation of the original lyrics. By the end of June, both versions had reached 4 million views. Hildegard von Blingin' has also covered Lady Gaga's \\"Bad Romance\\", Radiohead's \\"Creep\\", Dolly Parton's \\"Jolene\\" and Gotye's Somebody That I Used to Know, changing the rhythm and lyrics to fit the genre. The trend was joined by other YouTubers, including Graywyck, Constantine and Samus Ordicus. Elmira Tanatarova in i-D suggests bardcore \\"carries with it the weight of years of memes made about the medieval era, and the bleak darkness of that time period that appeals to Gen Z's existential humour.\\" As of September 2020 hundreds of songs have been covered in medieval/bardcore style, most can be found on YouTube.

She was assisted by her sister Clara Cattell. Life Cattell was born in Sheldon in 1857. Her parents were Fanny Mary (born Pate) and John Cattell and she was the second of their ten children. One of her sisters Emma Maria was disabled after an accident with a donkey and looking after her was one of the ways that she gained an interest and learnt about nursing. Maud's early education is thought to be by governesses. Another sister Clara Jane Cattell was three years younger than her and she would train in Liverpool and Switzerland before becoming a deaconess at Mildmay Mission. Mildmay Mission Hospital in 1892 The Mildmay Mission Hospital had been opened by Catherine Pennefather in 1877. It was based at Central Hall, close to the Royal London Hospital. Cattell joined the mission in 1886 and was trained by Pennefather. Her sister, Clara, also worked at the hospital and was promoted to lead the men's ward. Clara left in 1907 to look after their parents. During the first world war Maud had a challenging time running the hospital. In 1916, the hospital's drains were so poor that the hospital had to close. Cattell was able to gain support and assistance from the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital and it reopened in part. In 1917 they suddenly received 36 casualties due to enemy bombing. Her workload wasn't helped when the Mildmay mission closed its admin section that year. The following year she had to run the hospital and undertake all the cooking for over eight weeks. She eventually retired when she realised that a younger person was required to run the hospital and she took time to train Dora Woodhouse who became her replacement in August 1919. She returned to her father and her sisters in Sheldon and she lived with Clara, Emma and Hannah May (Kemp). It was Hannah May who nursed her. Death and legacy Cattell died in 1946 in the Sheldon area of Birmingham. The hospital she had lead was meant to be closed in 1988 but Helen Taylor Thompson led the campaign to keep it open and it became Europe's first AIDS hospital.

His middle name was wrongly identified as Webb in some sources. He is known largely from the paintings of natural history subjects that he made during Captain Cook's voyages. The now extinct Hemignathus obscurus, illustration by Ellis Ellis was baptized on 11 June 1751 at Ely Cathedral to Thomas, canon at Ely Cathedral, and Elizabeth. A brother became a vicar at Melbourn, Cambridgeshire. Little is known of his early life but he was described by David Samwell, surgeon on HMS Discovery as \\"a genteel young fellow and of good education\\". He served on all three of Captain Cook's voyages and may have improved his artistic skills through the influence of John Webber after moving from HMS Discovery to the HMS Resolution. Descriptions of specimens in his notebooks suggest that he was scientifically trained and had a knowledge of Latin but claims that he trained at Cambridge University and at St. Bartholomew's Hospital have not been supported by evidence. Ellis met Joseph Banks and gave him some of his drawings hoping to be remunerated and owing to financial difficulties he took up an offer to write an account of the third voyage which was published in 1782 but was not paid for the book sales due to breach of terms in the contract. In 1785 he went to join the Queen Charlotte on a voyage to northwest America but he had an accident at Ostend, Belgium, fell from the mast of the ship and died from injuries.The Times. 4 July, 1785.

He is a senior lecturer in the Department of Physics at the University of Otago and a principal investigator in the Dodd-Walls Centre. His research focuses on the interaction of light and matter in dielectric materials, and his speciality is whispering gallery mode resonators (WGMRs), small disks of dielectric which confine and store laser light to facilitate nonlinear interactions. He uses these to generate optical frequency combs and to coherently convert between microwave and optical photons.  Biography  Born in Berlin, Schwefel spent his undergraduate years from 1994 till 1998 studying physics and maths at Brandenburg University of Technology (BTU) Cottbus in Germany. During this time he took an active part in student politics as a member and then chairman of the student council StuRa. He organised strikes and demonstrations in response to savings plans proposed by Science Minister Steffen Reiche in a draft of the Brandenburg Higher Education Act that granted unlimited rights to close and merge universities. Schwefel was motivated to maintain the small size of universities in East Germany which offered educational advantages. He encouraged students to be active, enjoy student life and study subjects they found fun. He also ran the Berlin marathon and climbed Mount Elbrus while at BTU. In 1998 Schwefel received a graduate student scholarship from Yale University and studied the topic of chaotic dielectric resonators at Yale University with adviser Douglas Stone. During this time he worked as a maths and science tutor at Davenport College. He graduated with a PhD in 2004 and took a postdoctoral position in the same department, spending seven years in total at the Yale Physics Department. In 2005 he visited ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories in Kyoto Japan as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2005 Schwefel joined the Max Planck Research Group at the University of Erlangen as a postdoctoral fellow and then established a research programme as a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen. Schwefel moved to New Zealand in September 2015 where he has reestablished his research programme as a senior lecturer in the Department of Physics at the University of Otago and a principal investigator in the Dodd-Walls Centre for Photonic and Quantum Technologies.  Research  Schewefel and PhD student Bianca Sawyer Schwefel leads the Resonant Optics group at the University of Otago. His research focuses on resonantly enhanced interaction of light and matter in dielectric materials. This includes both theoretical and experimental work in the linear and nonlinear domains. He specialises in whispering galley mode resonators (WGMRs), small disks of dielectric materials which are used to confine, store and therefore intensify light to facilitate nonlinear interactions. These devices are based on the whispering gallery wave phenomenon, where laser light bounces around the inner surface of a dielectric disc, confined by total internal reflection. Schwefel began research on WGMRs at the Max Planck Institute and has further developed fabrication techniques to achieve high quality factors, which means that large amounts of laser light can be confined and stored within the resonator with very little leakage. The resulting high electric field strengths enable efficient nonlinear interactions. Schwefel's group are exploring the use of WGMRs for generating optical frequency combs, coherently converting microwave and terahertz radiation into the optical domain as well as other fundamental investigations. = Optical frequency combs and telecommunication = Schwefel and his team have used WGMRs made of second order nonlinear crystals, such as lithium niobate, to generate optical frequency combs of record efficiency. These devices show potential to significantly improve the efficiency of the internet by reducing the power required to encode data and the information- carrying capacity of optical fibres. The frequency combs are generated by sending low power microwave and optical signals into a WGMR; the crystal is electro-optically active, so its optical properties change under the influence of an electric field. The electric field of the microwaves influences the light waves and as a result a cascade of over a hundred new optical frequencies are generated from the original optical frequency. The device produces 160 coherent laser frequencies at low power. They have potential use in submarine optical networks and data centres where a single optical frequency comb could replace over a hundred lasers currently used to encode and send data on optical fibres. Because all the laser lines generated are from the same source, they have the same noise characteristics and stable phase relation. This would allow the transport of more light down a single optical fibre, increasing its information-carrying capacity. Unlike the more common microresonator optical frequency combs, which are based on the third- order nonlinear Kerr effect, these optical frequency combs rely on a second- order nonlinear effect, which has enabled improvements in efficiency. Schwefel and his team are collaborating with New Zealand-based optical technology company Coherent Solutions to develop applications and are also investigating the use of their frequency combs for high-precision spectroscopy. The WGMRs also show potential for reducing the line-width of fibre lasers. Schwefel and his team have found that placing a WGMR as a passive filtering element within the loop of a fibre laser reduces the line width to sub-kHz levels, which improves the stability of the system. = Quantum computing and communication = Schwefel's team have used their WGMRs to coherently convert microwave photons into optical photons. This offers a method for coherent optical telecommunication between individual quantum computers. Some superconducting quantum computers use microwave photons as the qubits for quantum information processing. As microwave photons are lost outside the ultra-cold environment of a cryostat, they cannot be used to communicate through ambient temperatures between quantum computers. Converting microwave signals into the optical domain and vice versa enables the use of conventional optical telecommunications networks for communication. Schwefel and his team have achieved coherent conversion by sending microwave photons into their WGMRs along with an optical signal. The two signals interact producing a third optical output signal that is coherent with the original microwave signal. They are working with researchers at the Max Plank Institute for the Science of Light to study the quantum properties of light that has been converted from optical to microwave light in a lithium niobate WGMR. In 2017 Schwefel won the Bright Ideas Competition, sponsored by the Optical Society of America Foundation and the international laser manufacturer Quantel Laser. He won the competition for his proposal to generate photon triplets, a new quantum optical state of light with applications in quantum optics and secure communications. The prize was $30,000 (US) worth of laser equipment, which he proposed to use to generate the photon triplets. = Archeology collaboration = Along with other researchers and students at the Dodd-Walls Centre, Schwefel has been working with American archeologist Leslie Van Gelder to develop an LED lamp that mimics the flickering torch light that palaeolithic cave artists worked by many thousands of years ago. The lamps will enable cave art to be seen in a more authentic light and help archaeologists answer questions about palaeolithic people and their techniques for creating cave art.

Historically the Mount Lavinia area has been associated with the production of Bibikkan, known locally as Poranu appa. Description The main ingredients of bibikan are jaggery, an unrefined product of sugar cane and the sap from the date palm tree, which has a rich flavour between caramel and molasses; dry roasted semolina (Uppama) or rice flour; and grated or shredded coconut. To make the dish, the semolina is dry roasted, the jaggery dissolved in hot water and brought to boil, to which the shredded coconut is added. The mixture is then allowed to cool before adding the semolina, cardamom, ginger preserve, candied fruit peel, cashew nuts, salt, baking powder and cinnamon which is then blended thoroughly. Separate eggs whisking the whites and yolks separately. Add the egg yolks and mix well. Add the lemon rind and fold in the egg whites. Pour into a buttered baking tray and bake in a moderate oven. Leave to cool and cut into squares to serve.

Demolished in 1958, it was the inspiration for the fictional Rovers Return Inn featured in the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street, first broadcast in 1960. History =Construction= The original timber framed building was completed in 1306, and formed part of the outbuildings of Withingreave Hall, a medieval mansion house that would later become the Manchester residence of the 17th-century philanthropist, William Hulme. Following his death in 1691, the inn ‚Äî along with the adjacent numbers 10 (then used as a warehouse), 14 (a shop) and 16 (the Mosley Arms public house) ‚Äî passed into the possession of Hulme's Charity, until sold at auction in October 1908. At the time of its construction, Manchester was a small medieval market town, mostly consisting of arable land, and Withingreave Hall was built on a lane with a stream and a grove (or \\"greave\\") of willow trees (\\"withies\\") running along the opposite side, from which it took its earliest name, \\"Withy Greave.\\" =Ale house= Although no records survive to establish when it first became an ale house, it was long claimed that it was the oldest pub in Manchester, a title also claimed by the nearby Seven Stars inn. The Seven Stars was completed in 1326, and first licensed in 1356, but appears to have been destroyed and rebuilt some time around 1500; the licensees of Ye Olde Rovers Return would boast that their pub had supplied the drinks \\"to the men who built the Seven Stars.\\" It was also claimed that beer was sold there when the first stones of Manchester Cathedral were being laid in 1421, and \\"there the masons retired between whiles to refresh themselves with good home-brewed beer.\\" Similarly, the first couple to be married in the cathedral celebrated their wedding breakfast at Ye Olde Rovers Return. Ye Olde Rovers Return sketched by Charles George Harper for The Old Inns of Old England c.1906 In October 1905, the pub was sketched by Frank Lewis Emanuel (1865‚Äì1948) as part of his series \\"Impressions of Manchester\\" for The Manchester Guardian (later collected and published as Manchester Sketches). His accompanying description reads: =Closure= The Seven Stars ceased trading as a pub in June 1911, and Ye Olde Rovers Return surrendered its license in September 1923, leaving the Old Half Moon, first licensed in 1645, to lay claim to the title of the oldest licensed pub in the city. Ye Olde Rovers Return retained its name and subsequently operated as a bookshop and an antique shop. By 1946, it was under threat of demolition as part of Manchester and District Regional Planning Committee's \\"Manchester Plan\\" for redevelopment of the city. It was eventually demolished in 1958; its original site is now beneath the Arndale Centre, where construction began in 1975. In 1960, it was the inspiration for the fictional Rovers Return Inn featured in the long-running British soap opera Coronation Street.

She was known as a prolific writer of \\"entertainment novels\\", and for this reason has sometimes been overlooked by literary scholars in countries where \\"seriousness\\" is at a premium. Her books dealt, above all, with the position of women, and in particular of women artists, in society and in the public sphere. Prominent themes included female homosexuality, set in the context of contemporary mainstream middle-class sexual morality.  Life  = Provenance and early years = The first of her parents' five daughters, Grete von Urbanitzky was born in Linz, a midsized city and regional capital located roughly halfway between Salzburg and Vienna. Her parents had both grown up further to the east of the Austro-Hungarian empire, as members of German speaking minorities, her father in Transylvania and her mother in Cisalpine Banat. In a series of autobiographical sketches produced during the First World War she repeatedly stressed the \\"Germanness\\" of her ancestral provenance: it was only during the 1960s that she started to capitalise on the genealogies of her two French grandmothers, intending, it seems, to distance herself from aspects of her earlier association with German nationalist positions. She was particularly close to her father, which in literary terms is reflected in the positive presentation of patriarchal authority in her novels, but she was also exposed to German nationalist beliefs which, during this time, were contributing to a destructive unravelling of political and social cohesion in what had traditionally been a more unselfconsciously multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian empire. She attended the pioneering K√∂rnerschule Lyzeum (secondary school for girls) in Linz and then a gymnasium (secondary school) in Z√ºrich, thereby receiving, in terms of the opportunities normally available to girls during the first decade of the twentieth century, an exceptionally solid academic grounding. She stayed on in Z√ºrich to attend lectures at the university, particularly relishing the opportunities to study Natural Sciences and Philosophy. However, after her first literary successes she broke off her studies and in 1909 relocated to Vienna. = Marriage and partnership = During this period Grete von Urbanitzky married twice, first to Ludwig Woluszuk and secondly to Peter Johann Franz Passini. Both marriages were brief and ended in divorce, the first at the insistence of Grete's father who was horrified by the debts his daughter and her husband were accumulating. Of more lasting importance than either marriage was the informal literary partnership into which she entered with Maria \\"Mia\\" Passini, the younger sister of her second husband. The working arrangement was soon complemented by a deep and lasting friendship. The women later set up home together in 1934; and then stayed together till 1945 when Mia Passini married an Englishman. = Pre-war publications = Urbanitzky's first publication appeared in 1911. \\"Sehnsucht\\" (loosely, \\"Yearning\\") was a compilation of various pieces of youthful written work, dealing with a strongly romanticised perception of the artist. It was a theme that would recur in her written work throughout her life. Published two years, later \\"Wenn die Weiber Menschen werden ... Gedanken einer Einsamen\\" (loosely \\"If women became people ... Thoughts of a woman alone\\") was a more substantial and structured work. On it, she took as her starting point what she defined as Otto Weininger's \\"gender dichotomy\\". To the predicated female archetype of \\"whore\\" and \\"mother\\" she proposed a third pigeon hole: the woman as artist, condemned to renounce both motherhood and love. Commentators naturally interpret this as an attempt by the author to create a respectable category that she might herself aspire to inhabit, in the context of the very conservative impression that she had gained of the world (or at least of Vienna's haute bourgeoisie). = War = During the First World War and the years that followed she published numerous pieces in daily newspapers and weekly magazines, generally writing for publications on the nationalist end of the political spectrum, such as the \\"Neue Grazer Tagblatt\\", \\"Alpenland\\", \\"Die Saat\\", \\"Die Deutsche Nation\\", \\"Gro√üdeutschland\\" and \\"Vierburgenland\\". In her contributions she elaborated populist-nationalist and racist themes. She defined her own literary output as \\"work for German popular culture (\\"Volkstum\\") and the race of the humans\\", asserting that the destructive erosion of the German and Austrian peoples and their cultural values was a \\"natural necessity\\" to fend off an annexation of Austria to Germany. Alongside these nationalistic pieces for the conservative press, she also wrote serious articles on economics and finance, becoming a regular contributor to economic journals in 1917. She produced (subsequently largely forgotten) poems, song lyrics and operetta libretti, and according to at least one source, became involved with cabaret. During this period Urbanitzky was in addition closely associated with the populist-nationalist mind-set through her cultural- political involvement. She organised readings in the Deutscher Schulverein, an organisation dedicated to protecting the German language in the many regions of the Austro-Hungarian empire where its status as the language of the government agencies and more broadly was increasingly under attack from a palette of alternative nationalisms and the resurgent languages accompanying them. She contributed a substantial piece to Arthur Trebitsch's 1920 anthology, \\"Deutscher Geist aus √ñsterreich\\" (loosely, \\"German spirit from Austria\\"), which she characterised as a call to arms, addressed to the nation's poets. 1920 saw the publication of her novel \\"Das andere Blut\\". Together with her 1921 and 1922 novels, \\"Die Auswanderer\\" (\\"The emigrants\\") and \\"Die goldene Peitsche\\" (\\"The golden whip\\"), this marked her most vehemently populist period. Commentators find the books openly racist and antisemitic, powerfully vehement in demonstrating the toxic \\"biological\\" underpinnings fundamental to the German-nationalist ideology of those times. = 1920s = Urbanitzky is one of those authors who takes care of servicing the cultural links between the postal service and \\"Die Neue Freie Presse\\" (liberal-leaning daily mass circulation newspaper), scoffed the satirist Karl Kraus. The observation reflects the high public profile that Urbanitzky enjoyed as an author in post-war Austria, but it also hints that there was more to her work than the convoluted rantings of \\"one more polemicist\\". After the headline grabbing aggression of her three novels between 1920 and 1922, such populist-nationalist outpourings were indeed less openly to the fore in her published work. In 1923 she teamed up with other younger leading lights of the Vienna literary establishment, including the writers Arthur Schnitzler, Raoul Auernheimer and Siegfried Trebitsch, along with the publisher Ernst Peter Tal, to set up the Austrian section of the recently established PEN International authors' association. She herself accepted appointment as \\"General Secretary\\" of the Austria branch. During this possibly more liberal phase she published her novel \\"Der wilde Garten\\" in 1927. The book focuses on the contentious theme of lesbian love, something of which Urbanitzky by now had significant personal experience. It formed the basis for the reputation that she subsequently enjoyed (or, depending on the circumstances, not) in that it established her as a novelist willing to deal with \\"slippery\\" sexual themes that others preferred to not to address.Christa G√ºrtler/Sigrid Schmid- Bortenschlager: Grete von Urbanitzky ... Erfolg und Verfolgung. √ñsterreichische Schriftstellerinnen 1918-1945. F√ºnfzehn Portr√§ts und Texte. Salzburg: Residenz 2002, pp. 135-144. There was no express distancing from the populist-nationalism and antisemitism of her previous novels, however. The novel \\"Mirjams Sohn\\" (1926) is often portrayed as philosemitic, in that it takes a theme from Jewish history as its starting point. The book is, in reality, sufficiently nuanced to provide for a range of conflicting interpretations. It deals with the appearance of a \\"leader\\" figure in the Amsterdam ghetto during the seventeenth century, but it nevertheless employs an anti-messianic plot structure - the murder of a messiah figure by Jews - and includes glimpses of antisemitic and indeed misogynistic ideologies.Viktoria P√∂tzl: Antisemitische und philosemitische Geschlechterkonstruktionen im historischen Kontext am Beispiel von Grete Urbanitzky‚Äôs Mirjams Sohn (1926). Konferenzvortrag zu ‚ÄûHistorische Romane von Frauen in der Ersten Republik √ñsterreich‚Äú, √ñsterreichisches Kulturforum, Warschau, November 2018. [Publication planned) The 1920s was almost certainly Grete von Urbanitzky most productive decade. It was the period during which many of her 32 (by 1943) novels appeared, often in rapid succession and with high print-runs. She combined her writing with a job as press officer for the Vienna \\"Volksoper\\", at the same time running her own literary agency. She was also publishing the magazine \\"Roman der Millionen\\" (loosely, \\"Novel for the millions\\") which was intended to produce a first German-language translation of a fresh novel each month. Unfortunately the magazine ceased production after the appearance of just four editions, probably for financial reasons. Between 1925 and 1928 she worked as a contributing editor with the liberal- left daily newspaper, Der Tag. She was also working for the aggressively anti- Marxist Neues Wiener Journal. Her private circle reflected a growing political ambivalence. She was in regular contact with high-profile members of the populist-nationalist faction, such as Arthur Trebitsch and Robert Hohlbaum, but her friends also included liberal authors - both Jewish and non-Jewish - such as Richard Specht, Herwarth Walden, Nelly Sachs, Gertrud Isolani and Felix Salten.Ursula Huber: ‚ÄûFrau und doch kein Weib‚Äú. Zu Grete Urbanitzky. Monographische Studie zur Frauenliteratur in der √∂sterreichischen Zwischenkriegszeit und im Nationalsozialismus. Wien 1990. As the 1920s drew to a close Austria was badly impacted by the backwash from the Wall Street Crash. A return to widespread acute economic hardship was accompanied by a retreat from moderation on the political front. With politics in both Austria and Germany ever more polarised, Grete von Urbanitzky managed to sustain a strange level of political ambivalence in her novels. In 1931 and 1933 \\"Eine Frau erlebt die Welt\\" (\\"A Woman experiences the World\\") and \\"Karin und die Welt der M√§nner\\" (\\"Karin and the World of Men\\") were both highly successful in commercial terms. In stark contrast to the novels she was producing ten years earlier, neither can be unambiguously defined politically. Certainly both of them include clearly National Socialist position statements and both are sometimes seen as \\"confessional books\\", but they both entirely lack the strident racism that was characteristic of Austrian (and German) National Socialism at the time, and when it comes to plot development it is striking that, notably in the second of the two, fascist ideology is uncompromisingly subverted.Christa G√ºrtler/Sigrid Schmid-Bortenschlager: Grete von Urbanitzky.

In: Zeitgeschichte 16, 11/12, 1989, pp. 387-395. = National Socialism = Although Austria was only integrated into Germany in 1938, the country underwent savage political ructions of its own several years earlier, and acquired its own National Socialist post-democratic one-party dictatorship in 1933. If her novels were politically ambivalent, when it came to her own life choices and events, von Urbanitzky evidently retained her \\"nationalist\\" beliefs. During 1933 she attended a PEN International congress at Dubrovnik when a motion to condemn Nazi book burnings was discussed. The German delegation walked out in protest during the discussion. Grete von Urbanitzky, who was attending as a representative (and the General Secretary) of the Austrian section, promptly left the conference hall in sympathy with the German group. When she returned to Vienna the Austrian section of the PEN International association broke apart, and von Urbanitzky faced widespread media criticism for the position she had taken in Dubrovnik. She also faced personal risks in Vienna on account of her open commitment to the German National Socialists. Fearing arrest if she remained any longer in Austria, in 1933 she relocated to Berlin. Once in Berlin she published a series of newspaper articles and gave a number of radio interviews, in which she called for a boycott of Austrian-Jewish authors and of other \\"liberal\\" Austrian authors. This seems to have contributed to extending significantly the German government's schedule of authors whose works were banned from publication in Germany, which traditionally had been an important market for Austrian authors. Although reader demand meant that frequent reprints of \\"Karin und die Welt der M√§nner\\" continued, its author soon fell out of favour with the authorities in Germany, just as she had in Austria. In 1934, together with her friend Mia Passini, she was arrested by the security services. They were soon released, but that was very far from being the end of the matter. Shortly afterwards one of her novels were determined to be philosemitic. In Prussia, early in 1935, copies of \\"Mirjams Sohn\\" (1926) were confiscated and locked away, having been deemed a danger to public safety and order.B√∂rsenblatt f√ºr den deutschen Buchhandel, 208, 6.9.1934 Later her lesbian novel, \\"Der wilde Garten\\", was placed on the \\"List of damaging and undesirable literature\\" produced for the first time towards the end of 1935 by the Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Ministry. The next year copies of two more of her books, \\"Eine Frau erlebt die Welt...\\" (1932) and \\"Ursula und der Kapit√§n\\" (1934) were removed from workplace libraries under an order issued by the \\"Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft Deutscher Werkb√ºchereien\\". These measures were part of a broader government move to \\"clean up the literature sector\\". On 16 January 1936 the security services received an anonymous notification of rumours concerning the allegedly Jewish provenance of von Urbanitzky's mother (who had died only in 1931). This development came in the context of newly enacted laws effectively requiring all citizens to research their genealogical provenance sufficiently to be able to demonstrate that none of their four grandparents had been Jewish, or alternatively to demonstrate the extent to which they descended from Jewish or Roma grandparents. The extent of Jewishness that the rumours imputed to von Urbanitzky's grandmother was not, in 1936, sufficient to require \\"indexation\\", but as a high-profile novelist her racial background was nevertheless of above average interest to the authorities. Sources indicate that race-based rumours about her mother's provenance will possibly or probably have contributed to the decision that Grete von Urbanitzky and Mia Passini took to emigrate. During 1936 they relocated together to Paris. Meanwhile, back in Germany her 1932 \\"Durch Himmel und H√∂lle\\" (\\"Through Heaven and Hell\\") was included on an updated version of the government's \\"List of damaging and undesirable literature\\" in 1937 on account of its allegedly pornographic content. In January 1939 von Urbanitzky was expelled from the National Chamber of Authors (\\"Reichsschrifttumskammer\\"), membership of which was normally needed in order to pursue a career as a published author in Hitler's Germany. It was nevertheless only in 1941 that her work was subject to a blanket ban in Germany, by means of inclusion on a newly extended government \\"List of damaging and undesirable literature\\". The immediate trigger for the ban was almost certainly her 1941 novel \\"Miliza\\", in which the German authorities had detected \\"pacifist tendencies\\" when it had been published (in Switzerland). By this time her Vienna-based publisher, Zsolnay Verlag, had advised her, in 1940, that he no longer wished to publish her books in what had been, since 1938, part of Germany. =Paris= In Paris von Urbanitzky wrote and in 1938 published the novel which she regarded as her most important \\"Unsere Liebe Frau von Paris\\" (loosely, \\"Our Lady of Paris\\"),Unsere Liebe Frau von Paris. Der Roman eines deutschen Steinmetzen. Berlin und Wien: Zsolnay 1938 (Zitierte Prim√§rliteratur) along with a number of resolutely non-political \\"entertainment novels\\" that she managed to have published by Zsolnay Verlag in Vienna. (Zsolnay was her principal publisher between 1935 and 1940.) =Swiss exile= It is unclear how long von Urbanitzky remained in Paris. By the time war broke out in 1939 or 1940 Grete von Urbanitzky and Mia Passini had moved to Switzerland where they settled together in Ticino. Switzerland was welcoming large numbers of political and race-based refugees from Nazi Germany: the quality of the welcome was variable. Sources nevertheless note that von Urbanitzky and Passini received permanent residence permits and work permits quickly and without difficulty (though for a successful novelist whose principal intended target market remained Germany - including what before 1938 had been Austria - it is hard to see that the need for a Swiss work permit would have been pressing). Von Urbanitzky had already been able to negotiate a publishing agreement with Morgarten Verlag, a publishing house based not in Morgarten (Zug), but in Z√ºrich. She continued to try and find a publisher in Germany, a far large book market, and one in which she had acquired a large and evidently faithful readership over the space of two decades. She entered into negotiations with \\"Kaiser Verlag\\" in B√∂hmisch-Leipa, which had found itself inside Germany (with the express agreement of governments in England and France) since 1938. Kaiser, it seemed, had no problem with negotiating a publishing agreement for Germany, but in the end the discussions nevertheless came to nothing. The friends made their home in Lugano. Compared to other exiled writer, von Urbanitzky was in some ways in a position of privilege. She was able to write undisturbed, and publish her novels in Switzerland where she was able to earn a sufficient income from them. On the other hand, she was ostracised by others in the community of exiled authors who had made their home in Switzerland. Memories of her contribution at the 1933 PEN International in Dubrovnik remained sharp. Later the women left Lugano, moving across to Ascona on the shores of Lake Maggiore, across the mountains to the north-west. In her written work, she responded to her 1939 ejection from the \\"Reichsschrifttumskammer\\" by producing what seemed to her to be consciously non-political novels such as \\"Es begann im September\\" (1940) and \\"Miliza\\" (1941), both of which were published in Switzerland by Scherz Verlag. The novels dealt with themes such as francophilia and European internationalism. There was a strong anti-war strand. In this way she finally distanced herself unambiguously from the populist-nationalist position to which she had previously, demonstrating a chameleon-like propensity for adapting her ideological convictions to her surroundings. After 1942, when it became clear that any return to Germany in the foreseeable future was out of the question, von Urbanitzky distanced herself from any form of totalitarian rule in \\"Der gro√üe Traum\\" (1942, \\"The Big Dream\\") and \\"Der Mann Alexander\\" (1943). After the end of the war, when Mia Passini went off to London to marry Henry Crowe in 1946, she remained in Switzerland, only now \\"discovering\\" the truly multi- national nature of her mother's genealogy. From now on she completely ignored her own earlier National Socialist involvement, using the German government's 1941 blanket ban on her works to present herself as having been persecuted and victimized by the Nazis. Having been persuaded to flee the country in 1936 on account of intensified attention from the security services, following rumours of her own insufficiently Aryan genealogy, might indeed have been seen as tantamount to being forced to leave, especially in view of the Shoah implemented by the German government after 1941. From Switzerland she reinstated her literary agency, which provided an apparently modest income. She also worked in Geneva as a correspondent at the United Nations Office there. She found that it was no longer popular to build further on her former success as a novelist. New editions in 1948 and 1949 of \\"Der Mann Alexander\\" and \\"Es begann im September\\" met with only limited success. Even if von Urbanitzky had set aside her enthusiastic support for the Hitler government back in 1933, others had not. During 1948 she negotiated a promising publishing agreement with Desch Verlag in Munich, but in October of that year the publisher pulled out at the last minute, responding to objections over the deal received from the journalist-author (and committed anti-Nazi) Elisabeth Castonier. In 1965, slightly implausibly, von Urbanitzky received and accepted a request from Bruno Kreisky - at that time serving as the Austrian Foreign Minister - that she should write a book about Austria from the perspective of an Austrian √©migr√©. One cynical commentator suggests that von Urbanitzky's own well documented attitude towards \\"official\\" Austria had set her up for this unconventional commission. Shortly after agreement was reached Kreisky lost his ministerial position as a result of the 1966 general election, and the new government evidently felt itself under no obligation to pursue the matter. The book was nevertheless written, and the manuscript was found among von Urbanitzky's papers after she died. During the final part of her life Grete von Urbanitzky seems to have been based in Geneva. By the time that she died there, on 4 November 1974, she was alone, suffering from alcoholism, and almost completely blind. Literary estate The Wienbibliothek im Rathaus (literally, \\"Vienna Library in the City Hall\\") accommodates fifteen boxes containing Grete von Urbanitzky's manuscripts. (There is also what sources describe as a \\"musical fragment\\".)  Output (selection)  Her translation work into German drew on English, French and Italian authors. It included several works of Claude Anet.

Educated in Scotland he started work as a schoolmaster at Newtownards. He also began to preach there initially with the sanction of the church.

He was the son of Michael M'Clellan who was a burgess of Kirkcudbright. John was educated at University of Glasgow, graduating with an M.A. in 1629.

The artwork is Basquiat's response to anti-black racism and police brutality. It memorializes the death of Michael Stewart at the hands of New York City Transit Police for writing graffiti in the subway.  Background  Aspiring artist and model Michael Stewart was arrested by transit police for writing graffiti in the First Avenue station of the New York subway on September 15, 1983. He was brought to Bellevue Hospital hogtied and in critical condition. After thirteen days in a coma, Stewart died from his injuries on September 28, 1983. His death sparked outrage concerning police brutality. Jean-Michel Basquiat was deeply affected by the story and said to friends that \\"it could have been me.\\" He had started off as a street artist writing graffiti as SAMO. Basquiat was not close to Stewart, but they shared a circle of friends. Stewart was dating Basquiat's former girlfriend, Suzanne Mallouk. Basquiat painted Defacement on the wall of artist Keith Haring's NoHo studio days after Stewart's death. Haring cut the artwork out of the drywall when he moved out in 1985. He had Sam Havadtoy add an ornate frame a year after Basquiat's death in 1989. It was hanging above Haring's bed at the time of his death in 1990.  Analysis  Defacement depicts two pink-faced policemen in blue uniform, one with sharp predator teeth, with batons clobbering a black silhouette. The word \\"¬øDEFACEMENT¬©?\\" is written above them. The shadowy figure is Stewart, but it could also represent any black man who has been brutalized by the police. The tags of graffiti artists Daze and Zephyr are on the artwork. While Stewart was still in a coma, artist David Wojnarowicz created a flyer for a rally protesting Stewart's then \\"near-murder\\" in Union Square on September 26, 1983. The flyer portrays the officers with skeletal faces beating a handcuffed black man with batons. It was taped all around downtown which may have inspired Basquiat's Defacement painting. In the years since Defacement was created, it has taken critical resonance with the Black Lives Matter movement.  Exhibitions  Defacement was never sold and it's seldom displayed in public. It is owned by Nina Clemente, Keith Haring's goddaughter and daughter of the Italian painter Francesco Clement. In 2016, Cha√©dria LaBouvier, an independent curator, partnered with her alma mater Williams College Museum of Art in Massachusetts to bring the painting to the campus. It hung in the Reading Room, which is part of the college's first library. In 2019, LaBouvier organized Basquiat's 'Defacement': The Untold Story at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. The exhibit centered around the painting and the reaction of the downtown community to the death of Michael Stewart. Artwork by Stewart was displayed for the first time.

The largest petroglyph assemblage in the wadi is focused on a single rock, to the side of the road, with a large number of horse riders depicted, as well as geometric shapes such as the letter I and cruciform images. The petroglyphs have to a large extent been preserved by a natural bacterial deposit, known as desert varnish. Similar petroglyphs have also been found in the nearby sites of Wadi Hayl, Hassat Al Risoom (literally 'Rock with Drawings') close to the village of Roweida, and Wadi Al Shanah. They have been dated to between 1300 and 300 BCE. Some dates for the petroglyphs have been advanced as early as the Bronze Age.

The owner of a flower shop in Schl√ºchtern in Hesse, he was gunned down on 9 September 2000 at a mobile flower stand in Nuremberg. Two days later he died in a hospital as a result of injuries sustained in the attack.  Life  Enver ≈ûim≈üek immigrated to Germany from Turkey in 1985. He first worked in a factory and then started his own flower shop. This eventually grew into a flower wholesale business which served several shops and flower stands.Stefan Aust, Dirk Laabs: Heimatschutz. Der Staat und die Mordserie des NSU. Pantheon, M√ºnchen 2014, page 464. A few years before his murder, ≈ûim≈üek became more religious, took part in Hajj with his wife and donated money to the local Islamic community. He considered opening a Quran school in Schl√ºchtern and sent his children to a religious boarding school. Enver ≈ûim≈üek was married and the father of two children, Semiya and Abdulkerim.  Death  On September 9, 2000 ≈ûim≈üek was operating a flower stand in Nuremberg. This was unusual, as he normally only delivered goods for sale at the stand. On this day, however, he had taken over sales at the stand while the normal operator was on vacation. Eight shots were fired at ≈ûim≈üek between 12:45 pm and 2:15 pm. He was transported to hospital and died two days later without ever regaining consciousness. Forensic examination of projectiles and shell cases demonstrated that two different weapons had been used: a pistol of caliber 6.35 mm, type not identifiable, and a pistol of the ƒåesk√° 83 type, caliber 7.65 mm. The crime scene was located in the Langwasser district of Nuremberg. Before 1945, the site was part of the Nazi party rally grounds, between the camps of the SS, the SA and the Reich Labour Service.  Trial  The family of Enver ≈ûim≈üek was represented by Seda Ba≈üay-Yƒ±ldƒ±z in the National Socialist Underground trial.  Commemoration  At the central memorial event of the Federal Republic in honour of the NSU victims in the Berliner Schauspielhaus on Gendarmenmarkt, ≈ûim≈üek's daughter Semiya ≈ûim≈üek spoke with Mehmet Kuba≈üƒ±k's daughter, Gamze, and stated that she had \\"not even been permitted to be a victim with a clear conscience\\" for eleven years\\". Semiya ≈ûim≈üek chronicled the story of her family's suffering after the death of her father and the interactions by the investigators with relatives in her 2013 book Schmerzliche Heimat: Deutschland und der Mord an meinem Vater (\\"Painful Homeland: Germany and the murder of my father\\"), which became the basis for the 2016 ARD television film Die Opfer ‚Äì Vergesst mich nicht (\\"The Victims - Don't forget me\\"). To commemorate all NSU murder victims, including ≈ûim≈üek, a stele was erected in Nuremberg in 2013. At the scene of the crime, a plaque in his memory was installed in September 2014 at the initiative of residents. The unveiling of the plaque was attended by his widow, who visited the place for the first time. The plaque was later stolen by unknown persons and the group \\"Das Schweigen durchbrechen\\" (Breaking the Silence) installed a sign with a picture of showing a picture of ≈ûim≈üek. In Zwickau in Saxony, the last place where the core trio of the NSU lived underground, a European oak was planted on 8 September 2019 in memory of Enver ≈ûim≈üek on the Ziegelwiese in the northern part of the Swan Pond Park. Only a few weeks later, the tree was cut down by unknown persons. The mayor of Zwickau Pia Findei√ü spoke of the ‚Äúintolerance, a lack of understanding of democracy and contempt for victims of terrorism and their relatives‚Äù demonstrated by this act. One week later, a wooden bench with an inscription placed in memory of ≈ûim≈üek was also destroyed. Barbara John, ombudsperson for NSU victims appointed by the German government, regards this as evidence for existence of networks that approve of the murders. Ten new memorial trees were planted and memorial plaques were installed in the same place on 3 November 2019, though criticism was raised over misspellings of ≈ûim≈üek's name and the failure to invite survivors and relatives. In March 2020 the city of Jena decided after a lengthy discussion to name a place in Jena-Winzerla, where the perpetrators of the NSU grew up, after Enver ≈ûim≈üek. In mid-September 2020, the opening of the \\"Enver-≈ûim≈üek-Platz\\" was attended by family members of ≈ûim≈üek as well as minister-president Bodo Ramelow and additional politicians.
