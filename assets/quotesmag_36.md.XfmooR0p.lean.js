It was published by Hodder & Stoughton on December 5, 2013 in the UK, and on January 14, 2014 in North America.The Late Scholar (Paperback) , Plot summary The Late Scholar features the former Lord Peter Wimsey‚Äînow the Duke of Denver‚Äîand his wife, the former Harriet Vane, and is set in a fictional Oxford college called St. Severin's, mostly in 1953 (according to internal evidence within the text of the novel). Wimsey discovers that, as Duke of Denver, he has inherited the position of Visitor of an Oxford college, St Severin's. The college is in financial difficulties, and is in the midst of an acrimonious dispute between the Fellows over whether or not to sell a valuable codex (a copy of The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius, with glosses which may be by Alfred the Great) to finance the purchase of a piece of land which might be worth a lot of money if planning permission can be obtained on it. The two sides are evenly balanced in numbers, and two of the Fellows appeal to him to resolve the dispute, and before he has even arrived at Oxford, some of the Fellows turn up at his seat at Bredon Hall to try and convince him of the wisdom of either course of action. Peter and Harriet quickly set off for Oxford. But the dispute turns out to be even worse than they had thought, with attempts (some successful) to murder some of the Fellows. The Warden has the casting vote, but he is nowhere to be found. And some of the successful and unsuccessful attacks resemble the murder methods in Peter's past cases‚Äîmethods that Harriet has used in her published novels. A side plot concerns the decision of Bredon, the elder son of Peter and Harriet, not to apply for admission to Oxford University‚Äîbut instead to study estate management at Reading University. While far from stupid, Bredon is not as brilliant as his father, and at Oxford unfavourable comparisons would have been inevitable. Harriet realises that Bredon is not only the son of Peter, but also the nephew of Peter's brother Gerald‚Äîwho was deeply attached to the land and to the cares of its daily management, in a way that Peter never was.

It was designed by Lange Leopold Powell and built by Thomas Keenan. It is also known as St Martin's Hospital. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  St Martin's House was built as a hospital by the Anglican Church as a memorial to those who had fought in World War I. The name St Martin's Hospital was chosen as the Armistice of World War I (11 November 1918) had been signed on St Martin's day. In 1920, architect Lange Powell won the competition for the St Martin's War Memorial Hospital. Powell was known to be skillful with pen, ink work and watercolour render, therefore he submitted a perspective rendering of the hospital which was described by the Most Reverened St Clair Donaldson, Archbishop of Brisbane, as \\"a gem in architecture\\".'Lange L. Powell, Architect', Kerr, Margaret F.; pgs: 33-35, Faculty of Architecture, University of Queensland, February 1957 It was an accomplished design by an eminent local architect with an eclectic repertoire. The proposed site was on Wickham Terrace where Anzac House now stands, but it was rejected because it was considered too far out of town. The hospital is constructed using mainly bricks and stone on solid rock foundations. Thomas Keenan and Son were assigned as the contractors of the project. Opening of St Martin's War Memorial Hospital, 1922 St Martin's Hospital was built by local contractor Thomas Keenan & Son for approximately ¬£46,000 ($92,000). The hospital was officially opened On 28 November 1922 and dedicated by the then Governor-General of Australia, Lord Forster. The hospital was run by the Sisters of the Sacred Advent to care for the sick, and contained seven main wards, single rooms and two operating theatres. The main kitchen was built on the top floor, while smaller kitchens were installed on each floor for food distribution. Powell designed it with a close; however it was proven to be irrelevant in some ways as it cuts off air ventilation to the patient's room. A children's wing was added in 1940. In 1945 a statue of St Martin, designed by William Bustard and crafted by Jack Muller was set in the Ann Street wall of the hospital. In June 1971 the hospital was closed, and the patients moved to a new hospital at Zillmere. During the 1970s, plans to demolish the building were thwarted by a public campaign led by the Save St. Martin's Committee. Recently the building was renovated, and in November 1990 St Martin's House was opened as the administrative headquarters for the Anglican Diocese. The top floor was converted to living quarters for the Precentor.  Description  St Martin's House is built on stone foundations with external walls of brick with sandstone facings, and is roofed with terracotta shingle tiles. The building is organised in plan so as to create a series of protected courtyards around the south transept of St John's Cathedral. This maintains the continuity of the system of closed spaces that surround the Cathedral on three sides. The base consists of Brisbane tuff, the ground floor to first floor's sill is made of sandstone and above this in brickwork with two stone string courses. The roof is high pitched and the windows are six paned pivot hung sash windows. The massing of the building is centred on the service tower which has radiating wings. The tower has three levels and a basement while the remainder of the building is two storeyed. The facade oriented towards the cathedral is the most ornate, with a conical roof over the operating theatre, but that towards the south west with its cloister is also an important part of the building. Openings are a combination of square headed and semi-circular, segmented, and Gothic arches. It is evident that Powell was fond of ornamental rainwater heads. On the cathedral elevation there are two rainwater heads with arms extending five feet on either side, giving the appearance of a cross. The entrance is rather insignificant and opens into the vestibule which is paneled in dark oak timber. There are private rooms on the cathedral side and small wards on the other, which open onto a wide balcony. The nurses‚Äô quarters are in a two storey wing of Eton House, which is just adjacent to the hospital. A children's wing was added in 1940 by John Darnell and the design is to blend with the main hospital. Although St Martin's is arguably not the most practical design for a hospital, it was mentioned that Powell made the plan to suit the elevation. The exterior is enhanced by the quality of the detailing including: the corbelled brickwork, cruciform rain-water spouts, and the statue of St Martin of Tours in a niche in the western gable. Arts and Crafts elements are clearly evident, and visually there are many similarities with the house most identified with that movement in the United Kingdom, the Red House by Philip Webb. Gothic elements are also present and St Martin's complements the other buildings which form the cathedral group. Internally almost all the evidence of the building's use as a hospital has been lost in its change to office and residential use. Although the joinery has been retained, the northern wards and central corridor have been combined into one large office area and suspended ceilings installed. The original top floor kitchen has been converted into living quarters. The southern verandah is enclosed, and a fire stair has been constructed behind the facade facing Ann Street.  Heritage listing  St Martin's House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Martin's House is significant as a memorial to World War I servicemen and women. The building also survives as evidence of the nursing activities of the Sisters of the Sacred Advent. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. St Martin's House is significant as a highly accomplished building displaying characteristic Arts and Crafts massing, fine detail and workmanship, and a range of major materials. The building forms an integral part of a group of ecclesiastical buildings and spaces. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway was merged with East Indian Railway Company in 1925. The Government of India took over the Bengal and North-Western Railway and merged it with the Rohilkhand and Kumaon Railway to form the Oudh and Tirhut Railway in 1943. In 1952, Eastern Railway, Northern Railway and North Eastern Railway were formed. Eastern Railway was formed with a portion of East Indian Railway Company, east of Mughalsarai and Bengal Nagpur Railway. Northern Railway was formed with a portion of East Indian Railway Company west of Mughal Sarai, Jodhpur Railway, Bikaner Railway and Eastern Punjab Railway. North Eastern Railway was formed with Oudh and Tirhut Railway, Assam Railway and a portion of Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. East Central Railway was created in 1996-97.

Formed in the early stages of the Syrian Civil War, it had initially been established to police areas controlled by the Kurdish Supreme Committee. In October 2013, the Asayish claimed to have 4,000 members; by 2017, the number had reportedly risen to over 15,000.  Structure = Organization = According to the Constitution of North and East Syria, policing is the responsibility of the autonomous sub-regions. Overall, the local Asayish forces are composed of 26 official bureaus that aim to provide security and solutions to social problems. The six main units of the Asayish are Checkpoints Administration, Anti-Terror Forces Command (, HAT), Intelligence Directorate, Organized Crime Directorate, Traffic Directorate and Treasury Directorate. By 2016, 218 Asayish centers were established and 385 checkpoints with 10 Asayish members in each checkpoint were set up. 105 Asayish offices provide security against ISIL on the frontlines across the region. Larger cities have general directorates that are responsible for all aspects of security including road controls. Each sub-region has a HAT command and each Asayish center organizes itself autonomously. Overall chief of the police is the former journalist Ciwan Ibrahim. In the Jazira Region, the Asayish are further complemented by the Assyrian Sutoro police force, which is organized in every area with Christian population, and provides security and solutions to social problems in collaboration with other Asayish units. Though the Sutoro is officially subordinate to the Asayish, and represented on the Asayish executive board, it operates largely autonomous in regard to its internal affairs. Thus, it patrols the Christian neighborhoods of Qamishli without interference by the Asayish, and when the Sutoro members want appoint someone, they don't need the approval of the Asayish. The Assyrian Khabour Guards and Nattoreh also provide security in towns along the Khabur River. On 17 May 2017, the Raqqa Internal Security Forces were established for policing in Raqqa. On 25 May 2017, a female branch of the Asayish was established in Al-Shaddadah. On 4 July 2018, a conference of the Internal Security Forces took place in Raqqa. At the conference, two flags were adopted for the ISF; one saying only Internal Security Forces in Arabic, used in the Raqqa, Tabqa, Deir Ezzor, and Manbij regions, and one saying Asayish as well, used in the Jazira, Afrin, and Euphrates regions. = Strength, composition and payment = The Asayish police has around 15,000 personnel: 10,000 in the Jazira Region, 3,000 in the Afrin Region, and 2,000 in the Euphrates Region. Ethnically, Kurds dominate the Asayish, though half of the active personnel in Jazira Region is Arab, while around 300 Turkmens have also enlisted, mostly in Tell Abyad. About 30% of the Asayish are women. Members of the force are paid $120 monthly salaries, which is above the average monthly salaries of Syrian civil servants, so that Asayish employment is rather attractive. = Involvement in Military Operations = While Asayish is primarily a police, the forces of Asayish were involved in tensions against the National Defense Forces, a pro-government militia. The tensions led to the Battle of Hasakah, on August 2016. Ultimately, the Syrian Arab Army was forced to give up neighborhoods in the city. In the course of the Raqqa campaign, the Asayish established the Raqqa Internal Security Forces.  Gender equality  Female members of the Asayish in Koban√Æ As with other institutions in the autonomous region, the Asayish are striving for a force based on gender equality. An estimated 25% of Asayish members are women, and the local Asayish forces are co-led by a man and woman. In addition to protecting civilians from armed attacks, the Asayish has created a special branch composed solely of women which is dedicated to gender-based violence, family disputes between women and protection of women during protests, and public celebrations. Their objective is to take care of every case in which a woman gets involved, from gender-based violence to a bank robbery. Female members of the force face additional risk from attacks by radical Islamists. However, joining the Asayish is perceived as a huge act of personal and societal liberation from an extremely patriarchical background, for ethnic Kurdish and ethnic Arab women alike.

I don't smoke cigarettes, I don't smoke cigars, I don't smoke a pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe, pipe...\\", followed by \\"I don't smoke the reefer\\" in a faux Rasta accent. He talked about it on The Graham Norton Show in 2010, where he explained that he was impersonating Jim Davidson's character Chalkie White for a sketch show, and that it was sampled into the track. Brigstocke said he was \\"delighted and mortified at the same time\\" when he heard the sample. \\"I Don't Smoke\\" also samples the guitar riff from the 1997 Skeewiff track \\"The Thin Line\\".

Early life and education Cavanagh was born in August 1860 near Beechworth, Victoria, the second son of an Irish born builder and contractor, John Cavanagh ( - 18 March 1895). In 1881 his family moved to Adelaide, South Australia, where his father took on a position as supervisor of public buildings in the Government Architect's Department. Cavanagh in his early teens first studied at the South Australian School of Art before entering the Government Architecture's Department, where he received architectural training (c.1882-1886). In 1887 he left to study architecture in London, in the studio- offices of John Slater, and then with Frank Baggallay and Walter Millard, before entering the National Art Training School. In 1888 Cavanagh passed examinations obtaining an associateship with the Royal Institute of British Architects. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society for his studies in ancient and modern architecture and art. He returned to South Australia and rejoined the Government Architect's Department, eventually reaching the position of Chief Draughtsman. In 1891 he established his own private practice, where he designed a number of buildings in Adelaide, Peterborough and Port Pirie, including the Barrier Hotel in Port Pirie. Cavanagh served on the board of the Art Gallery, Museum and Library and was a member of the Adelaide Art Circle and South Australian Society of Arts. He was also a councillor at the Adelaide City Council, the president of the South Australia Institute of Architects and a founding member of the South Australian branch of the Australian Natives' Association and the Wattle Day League. Western Australia works The expansion of St Mary's Cathedral in 1929 The apse and transept of the 1930 portion of St Mary's Cathedral In 1895 he moved to Western Australia, with the objective of establishing a branch of his firm in Perth. In 1896 he designed the Great Western Hotel, a three storey brick, stucco and iron roof hotel, on the corner of James and William Streets, Northbridge. Cavanagh designed the hotel in the Federation Filigree architectural style and it was one of the most lavish hotels constructed in Perth during the Western Australian gold boom. On 11 May 1897 he married Dorothy Le Poer Trench, the third daughter of Hon. Judge Robert Le Poer Trench, Q.C., a County Court Judge of Ballarat, at St Mary's Cathedral, Perth. In 1898 the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate commissioned Cavanagh to design a new church on the site of a former Benedictine church in Fremantle. The church is an imposing limestone building in the Federation Gothic style with decorated Gothic detailing. St. Patrick's Basilica was consecrated in June 1900, with numerous dignitaries, including Sir John Forrest, in attendance. It is one of five churches in Australia with minor basilica status. In 1900 he was joined by his younger brother, James Charles, who became a partner in the architectural practice, Cavanagh and Cavanagh. The firm had a long association with the Catholic Church, designing a number of hospitals, schools and churches. In 1924 the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Perth, Patrick Clune, commenced an appeal to fund the construction of a larger cathedral, to replace the original 1865 building (which was a simple two storey Norman Gothic style building), in his own words \\"building a Cathedral worthy of Almighty God, of the Archdiocese and of the City of Perth\\". Cavanagh was appointed architect for the project and he produced plans for a completely new limestone Academic Gothic Cathedral. Due to financial constraints, associated with the onset of the Great Depression, it was decided to utilise the existing building, which subsequently became the nave, and add only new transepts and a sanctuary. The expanded, but incomplete, St Mary's Cathedral opened on 4 May 1930. Cavanagh died at a private hospital in Subiaco on 29 May 1941, following a two-month illness, and was buried in the Roman Catholic portion of Karrakatta Cemetery. Achievements Cavanagh was the inaugural vice-president of the Western Australian Institute of Architects in 1896 and the Institute's president between 1903‚Äì05 and 1915-17. (The WA Institute merged with other states' institutes in 1930 to form the Australian Institute of Architects.) At the 1897 colonial election Cavanagh unsuccessfully ran as an independent candidate for the seat of North Perth. In November 1900 he was elected as the West Ward Councillor for the City of Perth. In the 1901 federal election he ran as the Protectionist Party candidate in the newly created Perth electorate. He obtained 40.9% of the vote, losing to the Labour candidate, James Fowler. He was also a member of the Fire Brigade's Board and the Perth Hospital Board.

In addition to her solo work, she has collaborated with filmmaker and composer David Lynch on various projects since 1999. Together they released two records This Train (2011) and Somewhere in the Nowhere (2016) on her labels, La Rose Noire and Meta Hari. Chrysta Bell also appeared as FBI Agent Tammy Preston in Lynch's Twin Peaks: The Return which premiered on Showtime on May 21, 2017. Her most recent album, Feels Like Love, released April 5, 2019, is a collection of disco, post-punk and torch songs recorded in Austin and San Antonio with her long time song writing partner Christopher Smart, who also produced the record. Chrysta Bell has been featured in Vogue Italia, Interview, W, The Observer, Rolling Stone, Texas Monthly, Le Figaro Magazine, Elle and others. Her voice and musical style are described as \\"ethereal\\" and \\"sensual\\". Early life Chrysta Bell was born to a Bohemian San Antonio couple who divorced when she was a child. Her father was a dentist, hot air balloonist, hotelier, and president of the local Bachelors‚Äô Club. Her mother was a professional singer and performer, whom she credits for early exposure to music from Michael Jackson, Eurythmics and The Go-Gos, among others. She began her professional career at a young age singing commercial jingles at Emerald Studios, a recording facility founded by her mother and step father in San Antonio. She was also active in local musical theater productions and appeared in a short film Jesus in a String Bikini. This was followed by a role in the locally filmed Chinese production Once Upon a Time in China and America (1997), directed by martial arts director Sammo Hung, in which she starred opposite Jet Li. Career=8 1/2 Souvenirs= After graduating from high school in San Antonio, Chrysta Bell moved to Austin, Texas, and became the lead singer for 8¬Ω Souvenirs.

In 1997 8¬Ω Souvenirs signed to the RCA Victor label and subsequently released two albums, Happy Feet (1998) and Twisted Desire (1999). The band received some national attention after making an appearance on an Austin City Limits broadcast in April 1998.Boz Scaggs followed by 8¬Ω Souvenirs Retrieved January 25, 2016 That same year they served as the opening act on an 8-week tour with The Brian Setzer Orchestra. The band also performed with Willie Nelson at his annual Fourth of July picnic. 8 ¬Ω Souvenirs dissolved in 2000. =Musical collaborations with David Lynch and others= In 1999 Chrysta Bell came to the attention of music manager Bud Prager, who had represented bands like Foreigner and Megadeth. Through Prager she met CAA agent Brian Loucks who had the idea that David Lynch might want to work with her. Loucks arranged a meeting at Lynch's home recording studio and the pair \\"hit it off\\", writing their first song \\"Right Down to You\\" that day. Lynch included the song \\"Polish Poem\\", co-written with Chrysta Bell, in the final minutes of his 2006 film Inland Empire. During her decade-long recording sessions with Lynch, Chrysta Bell performed with various indie bands in Texas as well as traveling performance troupes MASS Ensemble and Soul in the Machine in California. These performances used oversized, homemade instruments and elaborate choreography and were often staged for exclusive audiences or businesses. In September 2011, Chrysta Bell released her debut album This Train, which was co-written and produced by Lynch and released independently through La Rose Noire Records. The album was officially re-released throughout Europe with additional bonus material on January 31, 2014, through the German-based label, QQ5. In October 2016, she released a 5-song EP Somewhere in the Nowhere, also produced and co-written by Lynch, on Meta Hari Records.

Lynch has said of her \\"Chrysta Bell is not only a killer performer, she also has a great intuitive ability to catch a mood and find a melody that's really spectacular. The first time I saw her perform, I thought she was like an alien. The most beautiful alien ever.\\" =Solo recordings= Between the recording sessions for This Train, Chrysta Bell recorded two solo albums, Bitter Pills and Delicacies and Strange Darling, a collection of covers executive produced by Lynch, both of which remain officially unreleased. Her third album, We Dissolve, released on Meta Hari Records in June 2017, was produced by John Parish, with guests including Adrian Utley, Geoff Downes and Stephen O'Malley. Feels Like Love followed in 2019. Speaking of the provenance of the latest album with Texas Monthly, she said, \\"I had to go off to California and experience Hollywood and get all of that enrichment, frustration, and elation, then go to England and record in the cold. I took these lessons and tools from across the world and have come home to put everything I‚Äôve experienced into the music.\\" =Modeling= Chrysta Bell began modeling in her late teens, posing for the Chicano muralist George Yepes for his ongoing Madonna series.

It is often used pejoratively, but some programmers self-describe themselves as a brogrammer positively as a word for \\"sociable or outgoing programmer\\", and it also tends to represent a subculture within the greater tech industry. An example sometimes cited of targeted advertising toward \\"brogrammers\\" is an early Klout hiring advert posted at a Stanford University career fair as \\"Want to bro down and crush some code? Klout is hiring.\\" The company later described it as a joke and as an unfortunate misstep. Brogrammer culture has been said to have created an entry barrier based on adherence to the image presented by its participants, rather than ability. It can be viewed as antithetical to geek culture, which emphasizes ability and passion for field over image. Effects on participation of women in computing Articles in The Atlantic have advocated strongly for the importance of an egalitarian tech team. According to research published in Fortune, 27% of women cited workplace culture as a reason for leaving jobs in the technology industry. This is the second most cited reason after motherhood, which was cited by 68% of women. In 2011, the Computing Research Association found that women received 11.7% of computer science bachelor's degrees. In a 2015 interview,8 Megan Smith, then-President of the United States Barack Obama's top policy adviser on technology, said to an audience gathered at Capitol Hill that tech companies acknowledge that their hiring of women is less than stellar; however, \\"despite promises to do better, only those that make it a top priority will see progress.\\" Not only are there biases among men, but there are also biases among women themselves. Studies show that women often underestimate and undervalue their own abilities. One such study exemplifies this by giving men and women a list of criteria that they have to meet in order to apply for a job, and results show that, out of 10 characteristics required for a job, men will usually apply if they meet three of those criteria, while women will only apply if they meet at least seven. \\"So biases will just be part of any decision we make. One of the big research fields right now is how to mitigate bias, and there are software tools being created and other things that can help address this challenge.\\" In a dissenting article in Gizmodo, Sam Biddle argues that the sexist effect of the brogrammer culture has actually been overblown by the press. He does not deny that there are \\"brogrammers\\", rather he argues that \\"the brogrammer as phenomenon is mythology, a fairytale figure conjured up by the confused and outmoded to explain progress in an old and stodgy industry.\\" His anonymous female friend in tech retorts by asking if women in engineering will soon be referred to as \\"slutgineers\\". Whether or not the \\"brogrammer effect\\" is significant, many new initiatives have arisen that seek to promote women in computer science and counter hostile culture.

She was engaged to Henry, a son of Conrad III of Germany. She died as a nun in the Admont Abbey. Life Sophia, as the first daughter of the royal couple, King B√©la II and Helena of Rascia, was born around 1135. She first begins to appear in narrative texts in 1139, when her father betrothed her to Henry, the eldest son of Conrad III (r. 1138‚Äì1152). Soon after Sophia traveled westward from the Kingdom of Hungary to the Holy Roman Empire, where she was presumably to learn the German language and court customs in preparation for her marriage. However her engagement with the young Henry was broken. Her father, B√©la the Blind died in 1141, and the relationship between his successor, G√©za II, and Conrad III grew increasingly strained during the following years. At one point in the mid-1140s, Conrad even briefly supported Boris Kalamanos, a rival candidate for the Hungarian throne. In this charged environment, the plans for a marriage between Sophia and Henry were abandoned. However, Sophia was still in the German kingdom, where she had been living for the past several years. Within a year she became a nun at the convent of Admont (today in Austria). According to Herbord of Michelsberg's letter written in 1159, Sophia was already residing in the double monastery at Admont when her betrothal ended. Conrad III had sent her there immediately after she left Hungary, because the German king wanted her to be raised within the abbey until Sophia and Henry were old enough to wed. When it became clear that her marriage would never take place, her brother G√©za II sent messengers to Admont to bring her back to Hungary. However Sophia did not want to leave, insisting instead that she wished to remain in the monastery as a nun. He then considered leading an army into Austria to take her back by force. Later, though, he decided to send a diplomatic mission to negotiate her return. The abbot of Admont gave Sophia the choice of staying or leaving. Once more, she affirmed her desire to become a nun, and G√©za II finally permitted her to stay at Admont.

Primarily working in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) settings, NNPs select and perform clinically indicated advanced diagnostic and therapeutic invasive procedures. In the United States, a board certified neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP-BC) is an APRN who has acquired Graduate education at the master‚Äôs or doctoral level and has a board certification in neonatology. The National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NANNP) is the national association that represents neonatal nurse practitioners in the United States. Certification is governed by the National Certification Corporation for Obstetrics, Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing Specialties (NCC). History The first modern day NICU opened in 1960 at Yale-New Haven Hospital under the auspices of Louis Gluck, a pioneer in the emerging pediatric specialty, neonatology. Dr. Gluck‚Äôs NICU concept demonstrated improved outcomes of sick and preterm infants and led to the emergence of NICUs across the country by the late 1960s. Most NICUs were located in large, university settings with patient management provided by medical interns and residents supervised by a neonatologist. To meet the needs of this vulnerable population, nursing roles expanded to include tasks previously relegated to physicians, such as initiating intravenous access and phlebotomy. In 1965, the first nurse practitioner program in the United States was developed at the University of Colorado to prepare pediatric nurse practitioners for primary care. By the 1970s, neonatal intensive care was an integrated medical service in many large teaching hospitals across the country, providing successful management of the preterm and sick newborn and reducing the neonatal mortality rate. Neonatal transport services were established to move newborns from their birth facility to the nearest NICU, enabling expansion of the NICU nursing role as nurses filled these new positions. Guidelines published by the American Nurses Association (ANA) in 1975 set the NNP program standards until NANN published Education Standards and Guidelines for NNP Programs in 2002.American Nurses Association. (1975). Guidelines for short-term continuing education programs for the nurse clinician in intensive neonatal care and the nurse clinician in intensive maternal-fetal care. Kansas City, MO.National Association of Neonatal Nurses. (2000). Position statement 2201: Advanced practice neonatal nurse role. Glenview, IL. These ANA standards led to the proliferation of hospital-based, certificate programs to train nurses as NNPs. National certification for NNPs began in 1983 by the NAACOG Certification Corporation, now the National Certification Corporation (NCC) for Obstetrics, Gynecologic and Neonatal Nursing Specialties (NCC). NANN was established in 1984, providing support to foster the neonatal advanced practice nursing movement. In the 1990s, states began requiring national certification or master's degree as entry into practice for the NNP. In the early 2000s, nurse practitioners lobbied for prescribing privileges to make their provider status fully operational. In 2007, NANNP, a division of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN), was founded as the only national association dedicated solely to NNPs.National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners. (2007). About NANNP.

Retrieved from www.ncsbn.org/2567.htm Adapted from NANN's Position Statement #3059, \\"Advanced Practice Registered Nurse: Role, Preparation, and Scope of Practice.\\" Education An NNP may have a Master‚Äôs and/or Doctoral degree from an accredited nursing school with a specialty in neonatology. Most states require a national certification through the National Certification Corporation (NCC) and must participate in continuing education to maintain the certification. Board Certification Following educational preparation at the master's or doctoral level, most states require NNPs to be certified board certified by an approved certification body. Board certification must be maintained by obtaining continuing nursing education credits. In the US, board certification is provided through the National Certification Corporation (awards the NNP-BC credential). Scope of practice The neonatal nurse practitioner provides specialized care for newborns with a wide range of acuity (level of illness) and conditions from prematurity, infections, genetic conditions, heart disease, surgical diagnoses, respiratory problems, and other disorders. NNPs primarily work in the hospital setting in well-baby nurseries, special care nurseries, neonatal intensive care units and the delivery room. Their specialized training allows them to provide individualized care to infants from the moment of delivery and from well babies to critically ill newborns . NNPs typically work in collaboration with Neonatologists and/or Pediatricians but (in most states) are licensed, independent providers who can diagnose and treat patients. NNPs have prescriptive authority and can prescribe medications as needed for the neonatal population (in most states).

It is an offshoot of urban exploring, but is not universally condoned among urban explorers due to high risk of possibility of fatal injures. Because it is often practised in the pursuit of making viral-ready videos or photos, it tends to result in heightened security and greater restriction against access to desirable exploration venues.

Board certification must be maintained by obtaining nursing continuing education credits. To align with the Consensus Model for APRN Regulation developed by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, certification exams and credentials are in transition. Prior to the consensus statement, adult health nurse practitioners (NPs) and gerontological NPs were educated and certified separately.

In the US, board certification is provided either through the or through the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (awards the ACNPC-AG credential for acute care), or the American Nurses Credentialing Center (awards the AGACNP-BC credential for acute care and the AGPCNP-BC credential for primary care), through the American Association of Nurse Practitioners certification program (awards the NP-C credential for primary care. Scope of practice AGNPs deliver a range of acute, chronic and preventive healthcare services. In addition to diagnosing and treating illness, they also provide preventive care, including routine checkups, health-risk assessments, immunization and screening tests, and personalized counseling on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. AGNPs also manage chronic illness, often coordinating care provided by specialty physicians. AGNPs that work in acute care settings often care for hospitalized patients in collaboration with physicians and other providers. AGNPs can be found practicing in a variety of medical facilities including hospices, long-term care facilities, hospitals, home-based care, correctional institutes and primary practices.

The history of the renaissance of the Orthodox church in Il'nytsya In 1907 at the secret meeting of the Orthodox movement in Il'nytsya, it was decided to send Oleksandr Kabalyuk (later canonized as Saint Reverend Aleksiy Karpatorusky) to Mount Athos to get the Orthodox objects of worship. In 1923 the majority of the population of Il'nytsya made a decision to revert to the true, canonical Orthodox Church and finally leave the Greek Orthodox Church, which had been propagated in all villages of the region for almost three centuries. Having escaped the Greek Orthodox Church, the Orthodox people automatically lost the church, all other church buildings and property. During the first years of their Orthodox life, the Orthodox Christians of Il'nytsya did not have their own church. The divine liturgies were conducted in a large room of the house, which belonged to Pavlo Vasylovych Savko ‚Äì the fighter for the Orthodox religion, who was prosecuted for being Orthodox. In 1925 a kind of a temporary barrack was built of wood near the railway station on the plot of land owned by Vasyl Hrytsanko and his wife Anna to hold divine service there. On this spot in 1926‚Äì1928, a wood church devoted to the Protection of the Theotokos was erected. The construction was maintained by the donations of local inhabitants. The Czechoslovakian authorities allocated 2 thousand Czech korunas to finish the erection. In 1937 with the help of the Mukachevo eparchy the grant-in-aid (1 thousand Czech korunas) was given to introduce the iconostasis. In October 1958 the porch was added and in two years sexton's room was finished as well. There were approximately 1,830 Orthodox believers at that time. In 1992 the construction of a new, bigger church commenced. The architecture of the future church was designed by the enterprise MIP ‚ÄúEkostroy‚Äù based in St. Petersburg. The erection was planned in such a way as to preserve the old church and pray therein as long as possible. That is why the divine service was never canceled during the construction process. Every Sunday God's words were heard from the ambon of the church. Due to some reasons the architectural plan was not fully followed. The upper part of the temple was remodeled by the local architects. In 2000 the erection of the church was completed.

The incident occurred on September 18‚Äì19, 1980, at Missile Complex 374-7 in rural Arkansas when a U.S. Air Force LGM-25C Titan II ICBM loaded with a 9 megaton W-53 Nuclear Warhead had a liquid fuel explosion inside its silo. Launch Complex 374-7 was located in Bradley Township, Van Buren County farmland just 3.3 miles (5.3 km) NNE of Damascus, and approximately north of Little Rock. (Coordinates: .) The incident began with a fuel leak at on September 18, and culminated with the explosion at around on September 19. The Strategic Air Command facility of Little Rock Air Force Base was one of eighteen silos in the command of the 308th Strategic Missile Wing (308th SMW), specifically one of the nine silos within its 374th Strategic Missile Squadron (374th SMS), at the time of the explosion. Incident= Leadup to the incident = 374th Strategic Missile Squadrons, reporting to the 308th Strategic Missile Wing. At around CDT on Thursday, September 18, 1980, two airmen from a Propellant Transfer System (PTS) team were checking the pressure on the oxidizer tank of a USAF Titan II missile at Little Rock AFB's Launch Complex 374-7. Due to time constraints when going into the silo, a ratchet ‚Äì long weighing ‚Äì was taken instead of the newly mandated torque wrench. The socket for the oxidizer tank fell off the ratchet and dropped approximately before bouncing off a thrust mount and piercing the missile's skin over the first-stage fuel tank, causing it to leak a cloud of its aerozine 50 fuel. Aerozine 50 is hypergolic with the Titan II's oxidizer, dinitrogen tetroxide; i.e., they spontaneously ignite upon contact with each other. The nitrogen tetroxide is kept in a second tank in the rocket's first- stage, directly above the fuel tank and below the second-stage and its 9-megaton W-53 nuclear warhead. Eventually, the missile combat crew and the PTS team evacuated the launch control center, while military and civilian response teams arrived to tackle the hazardous situation. There was concern for the possible collapse of the now empty first-stage fuel tank, which could cause the rest of the 8-story missile to fall and rupture, allowing the oxidizer to contact the fuel already in the silo. = The explosion = A Titan II ICBM in its launch silo Early in the morning of Friday, September 19, a two-man PTS investigation team consisting of Senior Airman David Lee Livingston and Sergeant Jeff K. Kennedy entered the silo. Because their vapor detectors indicated an explosive atmosphere, the two were ordered to evacuate. The team was then ordered to reenter the silo to turn on an exhaust fan. Senior airman David Livingston reentered the silo to carry out the order and shortly thereafter, at about , the hypergolic fuel exploded ‚Äì likely due to arcing in the exhaust fan. The initial explosion catapulted the 740-ton silo door away from the silo and ejected the second stage and warhead. Once clear of the silo, the second stage exploded. The W53 warhead landed about from the launch complex's entry gate; its safety features prevented any loss of radioactive material or nuclear detonation. = After the explosion = Livingston died at the hospital, and 21 others in the immediate vicinity of the blast sustained various injuries; Kennedy struggled with respiratory issues from inhaling oxidizer but survived. Livingston was posthumously promoted to sergeant (E-5). The entire missile launch complex was destroyed. At daybreak, the Air Force retrieved the warhead, which was returned to the Pantex weapons assembly plant. The launch complex was never repaired. Pieces of debris were taken away from the surrounding the facility, and the site was buried under a mound of gravel, soil, and small concrete debris. The land is now under private ownership. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 18, 2000. Popular culture A 1988 television film, Disaster at Silo 7, is based on this event. Season 4, episode 4 (ep. 75) of Scorpion is largely based on this event. In September 2013, Eric Schlosser published a book titled Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety. It focused on the explosion, as well as other Broken Arrow incidents during the Cold War. A documentary film titled Command and Control from director Robert Kenner, based on Schlosser's book, was released on January 10, 2017. The film was broadcast by PBS as part of its American Experience series.

Boris Yevseyevich Gusman (1892‚Äì1944) was a Soviet author, screenplay writer, theater director, and columnist for Pravda. As deputy director for the Bolshoi Theatre and later director of the Soviet Radio Committee Arts Division, Gusman played an important role in promoting Sergei Prokofiev's music in the USSR and internationally. Gusman was arrested during the Great Purges of the late 1930s, and died in a labor camp in 1944. Life=Pravda and art criticism= As a young man Gusman was a violinist and played for the St. Petersburg Symphony Orchestra of the Sheremetev family. Prior to the Russian Revolution and during the First World War, Gusman associated with intellectuals and critics around the Enchanted Wanderer magazine, including Dimitri Kruchkov and Victor Khovin, both members of the Ego-Futurist movement. In 1917 he moved to Nizhny Novgorod to marry the daughter of a merchant, who soon gave birth to a son, Israel Gusman. Gusman also became active in the local Bolshevik branch in Novgorod; he joined the Communist Party in 1918, and by 1920 was named the editor of its newspaper, the Nizhny Novogorod Workers' Leaflet (later the Nizhny Novgorod Commune). It was in 1921 that Gusman and his family moved to Moscow, where he began writing for Pravda. He was recognized as an important film critic, and from 1923 onwards headed Pravda's theatre section. Gusman rejected arguments among some Soviet filmmakers, associated with the Proletkult movement, that contributing to a new Soviet cinema required abandoning the history of film altogether. Gusman wrote that the new cinema \\"must be built brick by brick, making use of everything that is healthy about the New World, and that which is good about the old.\\" Gusman responded favorably to candid films pioneered by Dziga Vertov called Kino- Pravda. He described them as \\"lively‚Ä¶ striking‚Ä¶ and interesting,\\" but criticized the lack of connection between scenes and the absence of unifying themes. =Musical career= In 1929 Gusman, as deputy director, led the State Bolshoi Academic Theater's effort to stage Prokofiev's Pas d'Acier with new cast and choreography. Gusman remained with the Bolshoi Theatre through 1930, and in 1933 became head of the arts division of the Soviet Central Radio Administration. Gusman played a central role in working with Prokofiev in the musical and cinematic production of Lieutenant Kij√©. Following the success of the film, in 1934 Gusman organized a broadcast concert of the music with Moscow Radio Orchestra. In 1934, Gusman negotiated a contract between Prokofiev and the All-Union Radio Committee, helping the composer return to Russia. Gusman also offered him a tremendous sum of 25,000 rubles for one of a series of commissioned works: the Cantata for the Twentieth Anniversary of October, to commemorate the October Revolution of 1917. Gusman also commissioned Prokofiev to write a Collective Farm Suite, a Dance Suite, and a suite from the music for Egyptian Nights. Though Gusman remained an important supporter of Prokofiev's music, neither he nor the composer ever witnessed a performance of the Cantata: the work was banned, and both men died before its performance in 1966. In his work with the Bolshoi Theatre and Soviet Radio, Gusman promoted Prokofiev's musical score for Lieutenant Kij√© (1934), a poster for which is shown above. =Purges and death= In 1937, Gusman lost his position as director of the Moscow Radio Orchestra, and was assigned a smaller post at a Tchaikovsky museum in Klin. That same year, Gusman and his wife adopted Svetlana and Yuri Larin, the infant children of Anna Larina and Nikolai Bukharin, who had been arrested. Bukharin was shot in 1938. Arrested in one of a series of purges targeting Soviet artists and cultural leaders in 1937‚Äì38, Gusman was accused of having written ideologically unsound scripts in the past. While initial purges targeted those linked (or accused of links) to Trotskyism, Gusman's arrest came alongside later, wider purges. Gusman's wife was arrested as well. Gusman himself died on May 3, 1944 in Vozhael, a punitive forced labor camp. Gusman's son Israel survived the purges, and would go on to head the Gorky Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra from 1957 until 1987.

Life The son of George North, citizen and pewterer, who resided in or near Aldersgate Street in London, he was educated at St Paul's School. In 1725 he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. 1728, M.A. 1744. North was ordained deacon in 1729, and went to officiate as curate at Codicote in Hertfordshire, near Welwyn, a village of which he was also curate. In 1743 he was presented to the vicarage of Codicote, and held this small living until his death. In 1744 he was appointed chaplain to Lord Cathcart. North collected English coins, and corresponded on English numismatics and antiquities with Andrew Ducarel. In 1742 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London; he was also a member of the Spalding Society. In 1750 he made a tour in the west of England, visiting Dorchester, Wilton, and Stonehenge, but from this time suffered from illness. Around 1751 North, with George Vertue and Ducarel, was one of the leaders of resistance in the Society of Antiquaries to the perceived ambitions of Martin Folkes. The outcome was that the Society was incorporated in its own right, avoiding any move to amalgamate it into the Royal Society. North also worked to write the Society's history, a related attempt to shore up its prestige. He was baffled in trying to connect the Society of Antiquaries of the 18th century with that of the early 17th century. There were no sources to prove continuity with the group meeting in the time of James I, a lack he made known. During a period of bad health around 1765, a number of North's papers were burnt as he asked. He died on 17 June 1772, aged 65, at his parsonage-house at Codicote, and was buried at the east end of Codicote churchyard. He was unmarried. He left his library and coins to Anthony Askew and Michael Lort. Works North attracted the attention of Francis Wise and other antiquaries by An Answer to a Scandalous Libel intituled The Impertinence and Imposture of modern Antiquaries displayed, published anonymously in 1741, a reply to William Asplin. In 1752 he published Remarks on some Conjectures (London), in answer to a paper by Charles Clarke on a coin found at Eltham. In this pamphlet North discussed the standard and purity of early English coins. He corresponded with the numismatist Patrick Kennedy on the coins of Carausius and Allectus. Among North's books was his manuscript account of Saxon and English coins, with drawings by Edward Hodsol. It later came into the possession of Rogers Ruding, with two plates engraved by North to accompany a dissertation (not completed) on the coins of Henry III. North also compiled A Table of English Silver Coins from the Conquest to the Commonwealth, with Remarks: a transcript by Andrew Gifford was in 1780 in the collection of Mark Cephas Tutet. His notes on Joseph Ames's Typographical Antiquities were made use of by William Herbert. North drew up sale catalogues for the coin collections of the Earl of Oxford (1742) and of Richard Mead (1755); he also catalogued, in 1744, James West's series of Saxon coins and Ducarel's English coins. A paper on Arabic numerals in England, written by North in 1748, was published by Richard Gough in Arch√¶ologia (x. 360).

Article III of the Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia provides the basis for nationality law, while specific provisions are elaborated in 7 FSMC ¬ß 201 et seq. History Prior to the establishment of the Federated States of Micronesia, there existed the status of citizen of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Trust Territory citizenship could be acquired through jus soli by birth in the Trust Territory (except if another citizenship was acquired at birth or later), through jus sanguinis in the case of a person born outside the Trust Territory to parents who were citizens of the Trust Territory by taking up residence in the Trust Territory before age 21, or by naturalization upon approval by the High Commissioner. Under Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, \\"A person who is a citizen of the Trust Territory immediately prior to the effective date of this Constitution and a domiciliary of a District ratifying this Constitution is a citizen and national of the Federated States of Micronesia.\\" Article III, Sections 4 and 5 of the Constitution provided for a period of six months within which certain other Trust Territory citizens could become citizens and nationals of the FSM upon application to an FSM court: domiciliaries of other districts of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and people who became United States nationals under the Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. General provisions After independence, citizenship of the Federated States of Micronesia is based on jus sanguinis. Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution provides that \\"a person born of parents one or both of whom are citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia is a citizen and national of the Federated States by birth\\". Dual citizenship Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution, as well as 7 FSMC ¬ß 201, prohibit dual citizenship, stating that \\"A citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia who is recognized as a citizen of another nation shall, within 3 years of his 18th birthday, or within 3 years of the effective date of this Constitution, whichever is later, register his intent to remain a citizen of the Federated States and renounce his citizenship of another nation. If he fails to comply with this Section, he becomes a national of the Federated States of Micronesia.\\" In 2004, Public Law 13-65 proposed to repeal Article III, Section 3 of the constitution, which as President Joseph Urusemal described it, \\"eliminates the constitutional barrier to dual citizenship\\", but would not actually permit dual citizenship unless Congress passed legislation defining cases in which dual citizenship would be permitted. When put to a referendum during the 2005 elections, however, this amendment failed to garner the 75% support in the popular vote that it required in order to become effective. Naturalization Naturalization is the conferral of FSM citizenship on an alien, or on an FSM national who is not a citizen. Naturalization procedures originally only applied to foreigners, but in 2008, Public Law 15-27 created procedures for FSM nationals to become FSM citizens as well, if they renounced the citizenship of other countries and followed certain other procedures. Naturalization is provided for in 7 FSMC ¬ß 204. Under regulations, naturalization requires a language assessment to confirm that the applicant has \\"an ability to read, write, and speak in words in ordinary usage\\" in the language of the state where he or she resides. Naturalization may be cancelled pursuant to ¬ß 205. Furthermore, under ¬ß 208, \\"any person who obtains naturalization through concealment of a material fact or willful misrepresentation in applying for naturalization, upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for a period of not more than two years, or fined not more than $10,000, or both.\\" Naturalization is quite difficult to obtain. By 1994, very few foreigners had been granted citizenship. 7 FSMC ¬ß 204 requires \\"Congress' recommendation by bill\\" prior to the President naturalizing a person as a citizen of the Federated States of Micronesia. According to the United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Congress exercised this power for the first time only in 1998, and continues to exercise it only on rare occasions. In 2013, Sei Francis Uemoto, the Pohnpei-born son of a Japanese immigrant father and Pohnpeian mother, who had lived in Japan until 1983 and since then in Pohnpei, became the first FSM national to be naturalized as an FSM citizen under the new procedures since 2008. Loss of citizenship 7 FSMC ¬ß 206 names five grounds for loss of FSM citizenship. The first of these is \\"voluntarily obtain[ing] naturalization in a foreign state upon one's application\\". Though thousands of FSM citizens move to the United States under the Compact of Free Association, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report, few migrants from countries with Compacts of Free Association with the United States take action to become U.S. citizens, as an example citing data from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service that only 7 FSM citizens naturalized as U.S. citizens in 1998. (FSM citizens must still qualify for U.S. permanent residence through normal procedures in order to qualify for naturalization, and the CFA does not offer them special privileges in this regard.) The remaining four grounds for loss of FSM citizenship are: #voluntarily taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or political subdivision thereof; #voluntarily entering, or serving in, the armed forces of a foreign state, with certain exceptions for service in the United States Armed Forces #voting in a political election in a foreign state where a prerequisite to such a vote is citizenship of that foreign state; or #if over 18 years of age, voluntarily making a formal renunciation of FSM citizenship. Additionally, 7 FSMC ¬ß 204 provides that a dual citizen who does not \\"register his intent to remain a citizen of the Federated States and renounce his citizenship of another nation\\" becomes a national rather than a citizen.

By 1875 William Amed Demasson, a carpenter wheelwright from Guildford, Western Australia, had added a dwelling with a connecting door to the store, which was at the time run by his wife. In 1886 Demasson purchased the store from Connor. Land titles show the Toodyay Road Board purchased the dwelling from Amy Twine in 1945. When the doctor's residence and surgery in Lincoln Street were demolished for the standard gauge railway in 1963, this dwelling was rented to Dr. P. O'Reilly and the shop became his surgery.

The Indian health system is one of the largest in the world, with the number of people it concerns: nearly 1.3 billion potential beneficiaries. The health industry in India has rapidly become one of the most important sectors in the country in terms of income and job creation. In 2018, one hundred million Indian households (500 million people) do not benefit from health coverage. In 2011, 3.9% of India's gross domestic product was spent in the health sector. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this is among the lowest of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) economies. Policies are available that offer both individual and family cover. Out of this 3.9%, health insurance accounts for 5-10% of expenditure, employers account for around 9% while personal expenditure amounts to an astounding 82%.http://www.cppr.in/article/health-insurance-and-telecom-markets-a- comparative-study/ In the year 2016, the NSSO released the report ‚ÄúKey Indicators of Social Consumption in India: Health‚Äù based on its 71st round of surveys. The survey carried out in the year 2014 found out that, more than 80% of Indians are not covered under any health insurance plan, and only 18% (government funded 12%) of the urban population and 14% (government funded 13%) of the rural population was covered under any form of health insurance.Ambrish Singh . Current Situation of Health Care Coverage in India, ISPOR, News Across Asia, Volume 5 Number 1 April‚ÄìJuly 2016. Available at: https://www.ispor.org/consortiums/asia/NewsAcrossAsia_Spring2016.pdf For the financial year 2014-15, Health Insurance premium was 20,440. Health Insurance Coverage in India:Stats from NSSO survey Presentation The health situation and the provision of services vary considerably from one State to another. Although public health services in principle provide free basic health care to all, the care provided by most state health systems suffers from inadequate resources and poor management. As a result, the majority of the population turns to private health services that offer more expensive care and of very unequal quality. In India, the health system mixes public and private providers. Public health facilities - local clinics providing basic care, regional hospitals, national hospitals - are funded by the federal states and the federal state and managed by the state authorities. Public health services differ greatly from one federated state to another. In some states such as Tamil Nadu or Kerala, public health facilities play their role as the first stage of the care journey, but, outside of these few states, the public sector does not reach the goal to provide the basic health needs of the population. India's public health expenditures are lower than those of other middle-income countries. In 2012, they accounted for 4% of GDP, which is half as much as in China with 5.1%. In terms of public health spending per capita, India ranks 184th out of 191 countries in 2012. Patients' remaining costs represent about 58% of the total. The remaining costs borne by the patient represent an increasing share of the household budget, from 5% of this budget in 2000 to over 11% in 2004-2005. On average, the remaining costs of poor households as a result of hospitalization accounted for 140% of their annual income in rural areas and 90% in urban areas. This financial burden has been one of the main reasons for the introduction of health insurance covering the hospital costs of the poorest.  History  Launched in 1986, the health insurance industry has grown significantly mainly due to liberalization of economy and general awareness. According to the World Bank, by 2010, more than 25% of India's population had access to some form of health insurance. There are standalone health insurers along with government sponsored health insurance providers. Until recently, to improve the awareness and reduce the procrastination for buying health insurance, the General Insurance Corporation of India and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) had launched an awareness campaign for all segments of the population. Launched in 2007, the National Health Insurance Program (Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana- RSBY) is led by the Ministry of Health and was adopted by 29 states in 2014. It is funded 75% by the government and 25% by the states. The worker and 4 of his dependents benefit from health insurance if they are not covered by any system and live below the poverty line. RSBY beneficiaries are required to pay an annual registration fee of INR 30 for hospital coverage up to INR 30,000 per year per family. September 25, 2018, the Indian government announced the launch of a new health insurance for the poorest citizens. Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi announced that the new system is expected to reach more than 500 million people and is called \\"Modicare\\". The reform is still in progress and aims to install universal social security in the country.  Structure and organisation  The Indian social protection scheme covers insured persons against risks related to old age, invalidity, death, but also sickness and maternity, unemployment and finally accident at work and occupational diseases This social protection scheme is not universal and provides only limited coverage, targeting mainly organized sector's workers constituting less than 10% of the population in India. All risks are placed under the supervision of the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Social security and health insurance is defined by 5 main texts in India: The Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948; Employees' Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952; The Employees (Workmen's) Compensation Act, 1923; The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961; The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972; Social security benefits are mainly managed by: Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) and Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) Types of policies Health insurance in India typically pays for only inpatient hospitalization and for treatment at hospitals in India. Outpatient services were not payable under health policies in India. The first health policies in India were Mediclaim Policies. In Year 2000, Government of India liberalized insurance and allowed private players into the insurance sector. The advent of private insurers in India saw the introduction of many innovative products like family floater plans, top-up plans, critical illness plans, hospital cash and top up policies. The health insurance sector hovers around 10% in density calculations. One of the main reasons for the low penetration and coverage of health insurance is the lack of competition in the sector. IRDA which is responsible for insurance policies in India can create health circles, similar to telecom circles to promote competition.http://www.cppr.in/article/health- insurance-and-telecom-markets-a-comparative-study/ In principle, government health services are available to all citizens under the tax-financed public system. In practice, bottlenecks in accessing such services compel households to seek private care, resulting in high out-of-pocket payments. Health insurance plans in India today can be broadly classified into these categories: * Hospitalization :Hospitalization plans are indemnity plans that pay cost of hospitalization and medical costs of the insured subject to the sum insured. The sum insured can be applied on a per member basis in case of individual health policies or on a floater basis in case of family floater policies. In case of floater policies the sum insured can be utilized by any of the members insured under the plan. These policies do not normally pay any cash benefit. In addition to hospitalization benefits, specific policies may offer a number of additional benefits like maternity and newborn coverage, day care procedures for specific procedures, pre- and post-hospitalization care, domiciliary benefits where patients cannot be moved to a hospital, daily cash, and convalescence. :There is another type of hospitalization policy called a top-up policy. Top up policies have a high deductible typically set a level of existing cover. This policy is targeted at people who have some amount of insurance from their employer. If the employer provided cover is not enough people can supplement their cover with the top-up policy. However, this is subject to deduction on every claim reported for every member on the final amount payable. * Family Floater Health Insurance: :Family health insurance plan covers entire family in one health insurance plan. It works under assumption that not all member of a family will suffer from illness in one time. It covers hospital expense which can be pre and post. Most of health insurance companies in India offering family insurance have good network of hospitals to benefit the insurer in time of emergency. * Pre-Existing Disease Cover Plans: :It offers covers against disease that policyholder had before buying health policy. Pre-Existing Disease Cover Plans offers cover against pre-existing disease e.g. diabetes, kidney failure and many more. After Waiting period of 2 to 4 years it gives all covers to insurer. * Senior Citizen Health Insurance: :As name suggest These kind of health insurance plans are for older people in the family. It provide covers and protection from health issues during old age. According to IRDA guidelines, each insurer should provide cover up to the age of 65 years. * Maternity Health Insurance: :Maternity health insurance ensures coverage for maternity and other additional expenses. It takes care of both pre and post natal care, baby delivery (either normal or caesarean). Like other insurance, the maternity insurance provider have wide range of network hospitals and takes care of ambulance expense. :These services are supervised by the Maternity Benefit Act. The Maternity Benefit Act applies to women who do not work in an establishment covered by the ESI but who are employed in factories, mines, circuses, plantations, shops or other establishments employing at least 10 persons. Also covered are women working in an establishment covered by the ESI, but whose salary exceeds the ceiling of subjection. :Since 2010, the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY) program, run by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, has been set up in some districts (52 in 2017). This program is intended for pregnant women aged 19 or over, during their first 2 completed pregnancies (viable child). The benefit consists of a total amount of 6000 INR paid in 3 installments, subject to having performed the obligatory medical examinations for the mother and the child: :* at the end of the 2nd trimester of pregnancy :* at birth :* to 6 months of the child * Hospital daily cash benefit plans: :Daily cash benefits is a defined benefit policy that pays a defined sum of money for every day of hospitalization. The payments for a defined number of days in the policy year and may be subject to a deductible of few days. * Critical illness plans: :These are benefit based policies which pay a lumpsum (fixed) benefit amount on diagnosis of covered critical illness and medical procedures. These illness are generally specific and high severity and low frequency in nature that cost high when compared to day to day medical / treatment need. e.g. heart attack, cancer, stroke etc. Now some insurers have come up with option of staggered payment of claims in combination to upfront lumpsum payment. * Pro active plans: :Some companies offer Pro active living programs. These are designed keeping in mind the Indian market and provide assistance based on medical, behavioural and lifestyle factors associated with chronic conditions. These services aim to help customers understand and manage their health better. * Disease specific special plans: :Some companies offer specially designed disease specific plans like Dengue Care. These are designed keeping in mind the growing occurrence of viral diseases like Dengue in India which has become a cause of concern and thus provide assistance based on medical needs, behavioural and lifestyle factors associated with such conditions. These plans aim to help customers manage their unexpected health expenses better and at a very minimal cost. : = The main publicly funded health insurance schemes = Plans funded by central government  * ESI scheme: This scheme covers organized private sector workers, which is about 55 million people. * Central Government Insurance Scheme: This scheme covers central government agents and retirees, i.e. about 3 million people. * RSBY: this scheme covers families below the poverty line of about 40 million families.  State funded schemes  * Andhra Pradesh: This scheme covers families below the poverty line or with annual income below INR 75,000. It represents 70 million beneficiaries. * Tamil Nadu: This scheme finances families below the poverty line or with annual income below INR 72,000, which represents about 40 million beneficiaries. * Karnataka: this scheme covers members of rural cooperatives, more than 3 million people. Key aspects of health insurance=Payment options= *Direct Payment or Cashless Facility: Under this facility, the person does not need to pay the hospital as the insurer pays directly to the hospital. Under the cashless scheme, the policyholder and all those who are mentioned in the policy can undertake treatment from those hospitals approved by the insurer. *Reimbursement at the end of the hospital stay: After staying for the duration of the treatment, the patient can take a reimbursement from the insurer for the treatment that is covered under the policy undertaken. =Cost and duration= *Policy price range: Insurance companies offer health insurance from a sum insured of 5000/- for micro-insurance policies to a higher sum insured of 50 lacs and above. The common insurance policies for health insurance are usually available from 1 lac to 5 lacs. *Duration: Health insurance policies offered by non-life insurance companies usually last for a period of one year. Life insurance companies offer policies for a period of several years. Tax benefits Under Section 80D of the Income-tax Act the insured person who takes out the policy can claim for tax deductions. 25,000 for self, spouse and dependent children. 50,000/- for parents.

She is a prominent critic of the modern 'psychopharmacological' model of mental disorder and drug treatment, and the role of the pharmaceutical industry. She has written papers,Over a hundred papers at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, PubMed.gov books and blogs on the use and over-use of drug treatment for mental health problems, the mechanism of action of psychiatric drugs, their subjective and psychoactive effects, the history of drug treatment, and the evidence for its benefits and harms. She also writes on the history and politics of psychiatry more generally. Her best known books are The Myth of the Chemical Cure and The Bitterest Pills. Career Moncrieff qualified in medicine from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1989. She trained in psychiatry in London and the south east during the 1990s. From 2001 for 10 years she was the consultant for a psychiatric rehabilitation unit catering for people with severe and enduring mental disorders. she works as a consultant in adult community psychiatry at the North East London NHS Foundation Trust, and she is a senior lecturer at University College London. Dr Moncrieff is a founding member and the co-chairperson of the Critical Psychiatry Network. This is a group of psychiatrists from around the world who are sceptical of the idea that mental disorders are simply brain diseases and who campaign to reduce the influence of the pharmaceutical industry and find alternatives to narrow, medical model based practice. Research and writing=The role of drugs in modern psychiatry= Moncrieff's work challenges the idea that drugs or medications have specific effects on underlying diseases or abnormalities. She challenges the theory that mental disorders are caused by chemical imbalances, something that we currently have no evidence for, even less evidence pertains to chemicals being the best form of treatment for mental issues. She shows that there is little evidence for serotonin abnormalities in depression, or dopamine abnormalities in psychosis or schizophrenia. She traces the history of the idea that psychiatric drugs are magic bullets and she explores the role of the pharmaceutical industry, the psychiatric professional and the state in fostering this model. She has documented the increasing rates of prescriptions of psychiatric drugs over the last decade, and analysed the way the pharmaceutical industry has created conditions like adult ADHD and the ‚Äònew bipolar disorder‚Äô to help market these drugs. =Models of drug action= Moncrieff is not completely opposed to the use of drugs for mental health problems, but believes that the action of drugs in these situations is misunderstood. Moncrieff developed two alternative 'models' for understanding what drugs might be doing when they are prescribed to people with mental health problems. The current mainstream understanding of psychiatric drug action is based on a 'disease-centred' model that suggests that drugs work by rectifying the underlying abnormality that is presumed to lead to the symptoms of the disorder in question. Moncrieff contrast this with an alternative 'drug centred' model, which suggests that since psychiatric drugs are psychoactive substances, they work because they change the way people think, feel and behave. According to this model, psychiatric drugs have no specific biological effects in people with a mental disorder, and they produce their characteristic effects in everyone who takes them. The changes induced by some sorts of drugs may, however, lead to the suppression of the manifestations (symptoms) of some mental disorders. The Myth of the Chemical Cure traces the emergence and development of the disease-centred model from the 1950s onwards. It highlights the lack of evidence for the disease-centred model of drug action for every major class of psychiatric drug. It also explores the commercial, professional and political interests behind the disease-centred model. =Antidepressants= Moncrieff has written several papers criticising the methodology of antidepressant research. She did a Cochrane meta-analysis of the small group of trials of antidepressants that compared them with an 'active' placebo containing a drug used to mimic some of the side effects of the antidepressants used. She has published one of the few papers that describes the psychoactive effects of modern antidepressants and their association with suicidal ideation, and with physical effects. =Antipsychotics= The Bitterest Pills traces the history of antipsychotic drugs from the introduction of chlorpromazine in the 1950s. The book also looks at recent developments, including the marketing of antipsychotics through the Early Intervention movement, and the promotion of a new and expanded concept of bipolar disorder. Moncrieff also describes the cultural development of the new concept of bipolar disorder, which she refers to as ‚Äòthe medicalisation of \\"ups and downs\\"‚Äô. Research by Moncrieff and colleagues described and compared the subjective or psychoactive effects of different antipsychotics. This included publication in the controversial and non-peer reviewed Medical Hypotheses. =Lithium= In early work Moncrieff analysed the evidence for the efficacy of lithium. She claimed there was no evidence that lithium was superior to other sedatives for the treatment of acute mania, and that lithium's efficacy in preventing a relapse of manic depression was due to the adverse effects caused by the sudden withdrawal of lithium. In later work she showed that studies on the outcome of lithium treatment in the real world fail to demonstrate useful or worthwhile effects, and suggest it may even worsen the outcome of manic depression. =Other drugs= Moncrieff has critically reviewed the literature on the use of drug treatments like acamprosate and naltrexone for alcohol problems and the use of stimulants in children. =History and politics of psychiatry= Moncrieff has developed a political analysis of the drivers of modern mental health theory and practice and explored the influence of neoliberalism. She has published papers on the historical context of the emergence of modern drug treatment, the history of psychiatric thought in the 20th century and of ‚Äòrapid tranquilisation‚Äô in psychiatry, as well as her books on the history of drug treatments.

The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].

Plot Barney and Robin each suffer panic attacks at 5:28 p.m. on Sunday, just 32 minutes before the wedding. Robin considers escaping through the window, as Ted and Victoria had from Victoria's wedding a year earlier. After she brings up how she wishes that Barney had found her locket as a sign of his reliability, Ted secretly gives the locket, which he retrieved from the river, to Barney and instructs him to take credit for finding it. When Robin realizes the truth, she remembers Barney's dishonesty and begins to consider that Ted is the right person for her after all. Ted swallows his feelings, and refuses to run away with her, telling Robin that they aren't the same people who loved each other once and that she and Barney are meant to be together. Unconvinced, Robin decides to run away on her own and crashes into the band's bass player, the event that Future Ted describes as \\"how Robin met your mother.\\" Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily manage to calm Barney down, but find that he is struggling to write his wedding vows. When Lily points out how selfish and easy his vows are to accomplish, Barney counters by remarking about how Lily and Marshall have broken all their marriage vows over the years. They are disappointed to realize that Barney is right. However, they spend a moment at the altar to update their vows and promise to keep updating them as they need to instead of making perfect vows. Barney witnesses the moment and goes to find Robin. Robin apologizes for knocking over the Mother, who sees that Robin is trying to run away. Because they do not know each other well, the Mother does not persuade Robin to stay, but encourages her to take three deep breaths instead. The Mother slips away as Robin follows the Mother's suggestion and Barney appears. He promises to make only one vow to her: he will always be honest with her, and begins with revealing that Ted had found her locket. As the wedding begins, Barney has one last panic attack, which Marshall ends with the final slap of the slap bet. The ceremony goes through without any trouble, even with the arrival of a bear as the ring bear (though Barney cancels the flower gorilla at the last moment) and concludes with Robin and Barney married before their family and friends. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology said, \\"While I'm not too pleased that HIMYM used a good chunk of its final minutes to rehash Ted and Robin\\", the episode \\"was the show's final chance to tie up loose ends and to get the necessary pieces where they needed to be for next week's series finale.\\" Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 7.8/10, praising the wedding and the conclusions of the Slap Bet and locket mystery. However, he felt Marshall and Lily re-doing their vows was unnecessary.

H.R. Stott who had served as vicar of the parish for the preceding forty-two years. The Bishop of Ripon gave the sermon. By this time Mr and Mrs Henry Williams of Moor Park had died, but in the intervening years since funding the building and endowing the vicar's living, they had given a vicarage, the church furnishings, and the village institute.

The round is D#, C#, B, A#, G#, F#. The tenor bell weighs .RiponandLeedsBells.co.uk: Beckwithshaw St Michael and All Angels Retrieved 28 January 2014 In the bell chamber is a wooden frame consisting of two tiers of three bells each. 1, 3 and 5 hang above 2, 4 and 6, such that 1 is above 2; 3 is above 4; 5 is above 6, putting the heavier bells upon one side, that is, the west side. They are hung thus: \\"each bell hangs from its original wooden headstock though a restoration has seen the fitting of independent crown staples and ball bearings. The third has an SG clapper whilst those of the others are wrought iron. Traditional stays and sliders.\\"Beckwithshaw Today:The tower bells and view from top of tower Retrieved 28 January 2014 The reality in the bell- chamber is a very small and roughly-finished room, only partially protected from gales by louvred, unglazed windows on all sides. A massive and braced hardwood frame fills the room completely from west to east. The frame is over high and is smooth and polished to the touch. On the south and north sides there are narrow squeeze spaces of about between the frame and the wall. There is no aid to access to the top of the frame. The wheels of the top tier of bells project above the frame. The frame exactly fits the room, and the bells exactly fit the frame, but only because their wheels are arranged in different directions to allow fit. Access to the roof would require a slim and agile climber who would then climb a ladder, and from the ladder lift and slide with one hand a very heavy insulated trapdoor. The trapdoor is weatherproofed by being shaped to overhang the lips on which it is seated. The survival of the frame and consequently the safety of the bells depends on the condition of this trapdoor and the roof. It is likely that the tower's floors were installed after hanging the bells: the frame could then be built in place, the bells winched from the floor of the tower, and the floors would then be put in. Winching the bells up through the tower would require a massive beam across the tower roof to support the pulley; no such beam exists now. There is a bell-ringing group which practises on Mondays at 6.30 pm; Ann McGeogh is tower bell captain.StRoberts.co.uk: Bell ringing at Beckwithshaw Retrieved 28 January 2014Beckwithshaw Today: Who's who photos Retrieved 28 January 2014 =Nave= Chancel and nave ceilings The interior of the building is lined with dressed local stone, and was designed for a congregation of 120 to 150. The pulpit and font were carved by William Pashley in 1886 in Caen stone.Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951, University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII online database 2011: William Pashley Retrieved 31 January 2014 At the time of consecration in 1886, there was a carved statue \\"placed between the west windows of the nave,\\" described as a \\"group of St Michael overcoming the Dragon.\\" This statue is now missing. To be able to stand between the west windows it would have to be at least on a pedestal, because the windows are from the floor. The name of the artist is unknown, but it may have been carved by William Pashley of Harrogate and Leeds, who also carved some roundels in Leeds Minster.The missing statue of St Michael slaying the Dragon was possibly by William Pashley because he created the other sculptures in the church (reredos, font, pulpit) or by Nathaniel Hitch who worked in a similar style. =Chancel= There is a Caen stone reredos by William Pashley, with \\"sculptured panels under moulded and crocketted canopies, the walls on either side being enriched with traceried panels.

It is housed in a lean-to structure against the north wall of the chancel, and its manuals and pipes peer through a specially-cut arch in that same north wall; all this was part of the original design. The lean-to is comfortably blended into the exterior design, and the organ fits neatly into the arch, flush with the wall and sitting close enough to the choir stalls to be used by the choirmaster in rehearsals. It was described as a \\"very fine instrument . . . contained in a handsome oak case with spotted metal pipes.\\" It has two manuals from CC to G with 56 notes, and 2.5 octaves of concave and radiating pedals from CCC to F: 30 notes.

The east window, installed in 1886, depicts St Michael and all Angels, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi in stained glass, drawn and painted by Charles Eamer Kempe.The image on the east window refers to Epistle to the Hebrews I.6: \\"Let all the angels of God worship Him\\" The two lights of the west window, also installed in 1886, show archangels Gabriel, Uriel, Michael and Raphael. On Sunday 26 June 1892, five new stained glass windows, also by Kempe, were dedicated at a special service with a choir and large congregation. The vicar of Luddenden gave the sermon, the Rev. C.F. Forster, vicar of St Michael's, read the prayers, and Mr G.H. Wood was organist. The windows had been presented by Henry Williams of Moor Park, John Dugdale and Master J. Appleyard-Williams. the subject for the images is taken from Revelations: St John's visions in the Isle of Patmos.York Herald 28 June 1892: Harrogate, dedication service at Beckwithshaw Church Second light of north-west window, by Charles Eamer Kempe > \\"The south-east window represents St John viewing the great city, holy > Jerusalem, which is depicted in the distance, with the river flowing from > the Throne of God, and on either side of the river is the Tree of Life. > Standing opposite to St John is an angel with a golden reed with which to > measure the city and the gates and the walls thereof.

He and his wife Hadidjah were the parents of Citra Award-winning musician Idris Sardi. Biography Sardi was born in Yogyakarta, Dutch East Indies, in December 1910. He was educated at a Lagere School, but also studied the violin with his father, the leader of the Norma Orchestra in the palace of Sultan Hamengkubuwono VII. Sardi was later sent to study with other men, including one named Fernando and another named Jonocy; the latter of the two was the leader of an orchestra which played at the local society building. Sardi played for Jonocy, but eventually left to tour Central Java with Kunstkring; he would sometimes lead the orchestra at the Sultan's palace, if his father was unavailable. In 1936 Sardi migrated to Jakarta to join the Faroka troupe, whose members included Roekiah and her husband Kartolo. He transferred to the Sweet Java Opera in 1937. By 1939 he had married Hadidjah and had a son, Idris. That year he was asked by The Teng Chun of Java Industrial Film to join the company as a music director. Sardi accepted the offer, becoming the first professional music supervisor in the Indies. Hadidjah, meanwhile, was signed as an actress. Sardi made his debut as music supervisor with JIF's 1939 hit Alang-Alang. Hadidjah co-starred in the film with Mohamad Mochtar, in an attempt to challenge the supercouple of Roekiah and Rd Mochtar, who were signed to Tan's Film. Alang-Alang was a massive commercial hit in the Indies and nearby British Malaya, and the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits it as one of the causes of the revival the domestic film industry underwent in 1940. During the next two years Sardi prepared music for several more JIF productions, including Rentjong Atjeh, Srigala Item, and Matula. The Japanese occupied the Dutch East Indies in March 1942, closing all but one film studio; this included JIF. During the three-year occupation Sardi played for the Japanese backed radio. On 17 August 1945 Indonesia proclaimed its independence, and by the end of the year the returning Dutch colonial government had occupied the capital, Jakarta. Sardi refused to work for the Dutch, instead playing for tips at restaurants, bars, and weddings. After the Republican government reoccupied the capital, Sardi again worked for the radio, under the leadership of Sjaiful Bachri. He died in Jakarta on 21 October 1953, aged 42. He was survived by his wife and son; Hadidjah acted in several further films before her death in 2013, while Idris garnered numerous Citra Awards for his film scores. Filmography Sardi served as music supervisor for at least seven films. *Alang-Alang (1939) *Rentjong Atjeh (1940) *Matjan Berbisik (1940) *Melati van Agam (1940) *Si Gomar (1941) *Srigala Item (1941) *Matula (1941) ReferencesWorks cited  * Category:1910 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Yogyakarta Category:Indonesian musicians Category:Indonesian composers Category:20th-century composers ","title":"Sardi (musician)"},{"id":"41627737","text":"Roorkee College of Engineering, Roorkee (RCE) is an engineering college located at Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India.

A small, awkward, tube-like passage descends into a stream passage, and hence to a shaft into Gaping Gill Main Chamber. The sharp and loose nature of the rock, and the quantity of water prevented full exploration for over 80 years, but the current route is described in one guide book as \\"a technical and exhilarating adventure\\". It lies within the designated Ingleborough Site of Special Scientific Interest. Description Rat Hole is an inlet feeding the Gaping Gill main shaft complex. A snug crawl of about with a few bends passes a couple of minor inlets before dropping down a climb. The passage below almost immediately joins a stream passage flowing from the left, carrying the Rat Hole Sink water. Upstream, easy going leads to the Rat Hole Sink entrance. Downstream leads after a few metres to a pitch at the bottom of which the water disappears down a gully, the way on being across some chock stone boulders to the main pitch. A descent of this is objectively dangerous, as it takes all the water and passes areas of sharp, tottering flakes. The current route descends a few metres but then swings into the rift to the east. From here a pendulum traverse leads to a ledge overlooking the impressive adjacent Mousehole (pronounced ) shaft. Above the ledge an aven leads to a small inlet passage. Across the pitch, a traverse leads to a draughting passage which passes under two small avens before becoming too tight. Mousehole terminates in a floor with a window through to the Gaping Gill rift, but the route deviates to the south and finishes on a large well-watered scoop-shaped ledge after a descent. A short traverse to the east leads to the final pitch, which lands in the Main Chamber. Rat Hole Sink is located upstream of the main entrance where the water sinks. The entrance is normally covered with a grating. Below this a squirm downwards leads straight into the upstream passage of Rat Hole. When the stream is diverted, Rat Hole Sink provides easier access to the Rat Hole pitches than the traditional entrance. History During the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club initial explorations of Gaping Gill the entrance to Rat Hole was buried under a bank of boulder clay, but this had washed clear by 1909. The cave was explored by C. Wingfield and E. Addyman as far as the junction with the main stream, and was surveyed by H. Brodrick and L. Slingsby, and with Wingfield, explored as far as the big pitch. This was plumbed to a ledge above the Main Chamber floor in 1912 by Wingfield, which he succeeded in reaching in 1913 by traversing across from Lateral Shaft, which was used at the time for winch descents. Rat Hole Sink was first identified as a major water sink by the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club in 1912 when they were conducting a survey of Fell Beck, its sinks, and associated passages. It was referred to as both P14 and Rat Hole Sink. In 1935, Craven Pothole Club took up the challenge of the undescended big pitch and after dragging in over of rope ladder with associated lifelines, Arnold Waterfall and Edgar Smith achieved the first descent into Main Chamber, but no one made the ascent. Interest in Rat Hole then waned, and by 1960 the entrance passage was choked. In 1983 the Craven Pothole Club started to dig out the sink, P14, as well as the entrance to Rat Hole itself, and continued their efforts the following year. P14 was the first to go and was named Rat Hole Sink, and the main entrance succumbed soon after. An attempt was then made to rig the pitch for SRT. One member started the descent but soon found himself amidst a forest of sharp and loose flakes. He reached the main ledge at and decided to retreat. This plan was foiled when he discovered that the rope had almost cut through above the ledge, and he had to return to the ledge leaving some of his ascending gear still attached to the rope. He then had a draughty wait for several hours before someone in the Main Chamber was able to confirm that his second rope reached the floor. Mike Wooding and John Gardner picked up the baton in late 1985, and in establishing a safer SRT route, discovered the Mousehole shaft which proved to be the key to the modern descent. They entered it about from the top, and were intrigued by an inlet coming in from the roof. By hanging a rope through a small hole in a calcite chamber above the first pitch they were able to pendulum across at a higher level, and traverse into the inlet series. The route was P-bolted and straightened up by Mike Wooding in 2004 / 2005, and in doing so he climbed an aven to a small passage above the first stance in Mousehole.

The album was released on October 22, 2013, and the sextet is expected to tour in the summer of 2014. According to JazzTimes, this album deviates from Harrell's previous works. The use of piano is absent, and the three horns often play in block-chord formation. There are hints of Latin jazz, R&B; and indie-rock. According to the review, \\"Colors of a Dream may deviate, but it never disappoints.\\" Down Beat magazine similarly noted the lack of piano, stating that the addition of Shaw on sax and Spalding on bass results in an \\"opaque and varied\\" soundscape. In March 2013, the group performed this work at the Village Vanguard which was broadcast live by NPR Music. Track listing All songs by Tom Harrell.

The tactical victory by the Catholic forces allowed the Imperial army to quickly advance into Saxony, while the Swedish forces were forced into retreat. Regional background Leader of the Catholic forces, General Albrecht von Wallenstein F√ºrth was a market town, whose marketing license had been suspended under Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich III, losing the privilege and all that went with it, to nearby N√ºrnberg (English: Nuremberg) shortly after its founding. This situation changed after Heinrich's death, and in 1062 F√ºrth was once again permitted to have its own market.Official Site for F√ºrth's 1000th Anniversary; 2007; fuerth.de; accessed January 2014 However, F√ºrth could not readily compete with Nuremberg, which had steadily grown and prospered in the ensuing years. In the following centuries, the City of Nuremberg became the most important town in the region, even making F√ºrth subservient to it at one point, despite F√ºrth's strategic importance. The character of the settlement of F√ºrth remained afterward largely agricultural. Consequently, in 1600 the population was probably still only 1000‚Äì2000.Historical Data and Facts; Official F√ºrth website; accessed January 2014. Background Map showing Regnitz river and F√ºrth: bottom left The town of F√ºrth is situated to the east and south of the rivers Rednitz and Pegnitz, which join to form the Regnitz to the northwest of the town center. The ford across the Regnitz, the reason for the original founding of the settlement, is the feature which gave F√ºrth its strategic importance as an access point to Nuremberg during the Protestant champion's, King Gustav Adolph of Sweden, campaign through Bavaria.L√ºtzen 1632: Climax of the Thirty Years War; by Richard Brzezinski; 2001; Osprey Publishing; Oxford; accessed January 13, 2014; Chapter 1, \\"The Road to L√ºtzen;\\" . In spring of 1632, Gustav Adolph had handed the Habsburg Emperor, Ferdinand II, a major defeat at Rain, where the head of the Catholic army, General Tilly, had fallen.Ingrao, Charles W.; 2000; The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618‚Äì1815; Cambridge University Press; pp. 45‚Äì6; . Subsequently, he had taken the Free Imperial City of Augsburg without struggle, and on May 17, had marched into Munich unmolested. He subsequently occupied Nuremberg, encamping his army outside of the city.Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: A‚ÄìE and F‚ÄìO*; series; 2007; Tony Jaques, edit.; Greenwood Publishing Group; accessed January 2014. Build-up King Gustavus II Adolph When Gustav Adolph marched on F√ºrth in late August 1632, it was arguably the greatest blunder in his German campaign. His opponent in the battle, and Tilley's successor, was General Albrecht von Wallenstein. In the spring of 1632, Gen. Wallenstein had raised a fresh army within just a few weeks and had taken to the field. He had quickly driven the Saxon army from Bohemia, and then advanced northwestward (aiming to campaign into Protestant-aligned Saxony). Wallenstein set camp and built defensive earthworks at F√ºrth. There he encountered Gustav, who had previously fired the town of F√ºrth in June, and who had come back up from the south and taken Nuremberg in order to oppose the general's designs on Saxony. Gustav soon tested Wallenstein's strength at the Battle of the Alte Veste (the \\"old fort\\") in late August, which resulted in a nominal Catholic victory, and forced the Protestant forces to quickly encamp in a defensive position, being nearly cut off from additional help. Gustav, the practiced besieger, now found himself besieged by Gen. Wallenstein's much larger force.  The attack Gustav was finally reinforced on the first (n.s.) of September. There followed the disastrous September third (n.s.) attempt on Wallenstein's well-entrenched forces at the Battle of F√ºrth; where the Protestant's offensive force suffered 2500 casualties. Gustav could not thereafter successfully persuade Wallenstein to take to battle on an open field. Wallenstein's post-battle tactic of maintaining a strictly defensive, well-fortified position paid off when, running short on provisions, Gustav was forced to withdraw southward on September 19 (n.s.). This left the two major opposing armies in the region in a stalemate which was not to be resolved until November's Battle of L√ºtzen, which resulted in a very costly victory for the Protestant forces. Results The immediate result of the Nuremberg campaign allowed the Habsburgs to advance into Saxony. F√ºrth had been almost completely destroyed by fire prior to the siege (on June 18‚Äì19), and was largely abandoned. Gustav died in the Battle of L√ºtzen, a devastating battle (for both sides) which took place six weeks later. In the next couple of years, Wallenstein's overcautious battlefield conduct and military errors led to his falling out of favor with the Emperor. Combined with his growing ambition and political intrigue, Wallenstein fell victim to an assassin in 1634.Note: Historians argue that it was quit possible the assassination was ordered by Emperor Ferdinand himself, who feared Wallenstein was growing too powerful.

It has partnered with more than 50,000 local African companies and individuals and is a direct competitor to zuwanu.com in Senegal and Konga in Nigeria.  History  In 2012, Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec, ex-McKinsey consultants, founded Jumia along with Tunde Kehinde and Raphael Kofi Afaedor. Jumia was launched in Lagos in 2012 and expanded to five other countries : Egypt, Morocco, Ivory Coast, Kenya and South Africa. In 2014, the company launched offices in Tunisia, Tanzania , Ghana , Cameroon , Algeria and Uganda , and by 2018 it was present in 14 African countries. In Egypt, Jumia has been trying to categorize itself as one of the leading e-commerce websites. In June 2013, Jumia launched Jumia Travel, a hotel booking platform, and Jumia Food, a food delivery platform. Jumia Deals was launched in April 2015. In 2017, Jumia launched Jumia One, an app that enables customers to pay bills such as airtime. The same year, Jumia launched Jumia Pay, a secure payment for people to shop on all Jumia services. This was followed by the Jumia lending program, an initiative that allows its vendors to access business loans. Jumia would later partner with Amadeus technology to launch a platform that enables people to book flights. In South Africa, Jumia operates under the brand name Zando (zando.co.za), focusing only on online fashion retail. Juliet Anammah: Chairwoman of Jumia Nigeria and Head of Institutional Affairs, Africa At the end of 2015, the founders of Jumia appointed Juliet Anammah as the CEO of Jumia Nigeria so that they could concentrate on global control of the company. Massimiliano Spalazzi took over from Juliet as CEO in Nigeria in January 2020 and Juliet was appointed as the chairwoman of Jumia Nigeria and the Head of Institutional Affairs, Africa. In 2015, Jumia generated $234 million in revenue, which stands for a 265% growth from 2014. In 2016, Jumia became the continent‚Äôs first unicorn being valued over 1 billion USD. In late November 2018, Jumia partnered with cryptocurrency company Telcoin to enhance payment service capabilities throughout their areas of operation. The same month, Jumia and Carrefour signed a partnership to sell online products in Africa. In April 2019, Jumia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and raised $196 million in net proceeds. The share price, initially offered at $14.50, rose more than 200% in the first three trading sessions. The first analyst papers release 21 days after the IPO rated the company at stock targets between 27 and 40 USD. After reaching a peak of nearly $50 on May 1, 2019, the share value has declined to under $5/share by year's end. In November 2019, Jumia announced the suspension of its e-commerce operations in Cameroon effective on 18 November. The company concluded that its transactional portal is currently not suitable to the current environment in Cameroon. As part of the portfolio optimization effort, Jumia later ceased operations in Tanzania effective on November 27, 2019. While Jumia operations in Tanzania provided many opportunities for customers and vendors, the company said it needed to focus its resources on other markets that can bring the best value and help Jumia thrive. The decision, the company affirmed, would help it achieve greater success in the future. On 9 December 2019, Jumia suspended Jumia Food in Rwanda, making it the 3rd country in two months as part of a continuous monitoring of the business environment and operating costs in the markets in which it operates. Jumia however vowed to continue doing business online in those countries on the classifieds portals, previously called Jumia Deals. On 9 December 2019, Travelstart entered into a distribution and commercial agreement with Jumia Travel, Jumia‚Äôs hotel booking platform, to power the latter‚Äôs pan-African online travel booking portal. Under the agreement, Travelstart took control of the sales, fulfilment and customer service aspects of Jumia Travel online booking websites in all its operating territories. On March 16, 2020, Jumia announced a major partnership with Reckitt Benckiser, a global health products manufacturer, to provide a steady supply of hygiene products at affordable pricing and help hamper the spread of the Coronavirus.

He and James Herbert Lorrain brought Protestantism to Mizoram, and some parts of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Together they were entirely responsible for the creation of written language in Mizo, beginning of literacy, origin of formal education and establishment of churches in Mizoram. They devised the original Mizo alphabets based on Roman script, prepared the first book and dictionary in Mizo, started the first school among the Mizos. Mizoram has become the most Christian populated state in India. As a professional educator Savidge was single-handedly responsible for introducing quality education in Mizoram (now the second highest in literacy rate in India). He is deservedly known as the Father of Mizo Education. Early life Frederick William Savidge was born in 1862 in Stretham, a small village in Cambridgeshire. His family belonged to Baptist Church. He had BA and PhD degrees. He worked as schoolmaster in London, where he met his future missionary partner J. H. Lorrain. The two became friends through their congregation at the Highgate Road Baptist Church in London. In 1891 he accepted the missionary post offered by the Arthington Aborigines Mission to work in India. He quitted his teaching job and left England in October 1891. He sailed for India and arrived in Calcutta in November. He attended an evangelical campaign at Brahmanbaria (now in Bangladesh) organised by the New Zealand Baptists where he met Lorrain. Lorrain was already in India since 1 January 1890. Mission in India=Arthington Mission= Savidge and Lorrain were to start camping and work in Tripura according to the plan of Arthington Aborigines Mission. From Brahmanbaria they headed east into Tripura, where their visit was bluntly objected by the ruler, Maharaja. Dejected they travelled northward into Chittagong. Here they stayed for sometime awaiting permission to enter Lushai Hills (now Mizoram). Since Lushai Hills was still under tribal chieftainships with constant warfare, their application was deferred and allowed to stay at Kasalong village, the nearest possible location. The area suffered a heavy shortage of food supply, and infectious diseases were rampant. They stayed for a few months under constant hunger. To defend themselves from any tribal intrusion the Rangamati Commissioner provided them with a rifle. Unfortunately neither of them had any experience in shooting, and failed to hit jungle fowls flogging around their hut. Then they suffered from severe dysentery. The medical doctor advised them to move to Darjeeling where a colder climate would revive them. After they recovered the doctor suggested they return to England for fear of their health. They were more determined than ever and soon sought passage to Mizoram. They stayed at Silchar for one whole year in 1893. Fortunately they could encounter some Mizo visitors from time to time, so that they could start learning their language. Finally a permit was issued and they immediately set off on Tlawng River in a canoe on Boxing Day of 1893. They arrived in Aizawl on 11 January 1894. The day is now observed as public holiday as \\"Missionary Day\\" in the state. They made camp at Thingpui Huan Tlang, MacDonald Hill, Zarkawt. They were the first foreigners the Mizo had ever seen having not authority on anything, so that they soon earned the nickname Sap Vakvai (\\"Vagabond Sahibs\\"). They immediately worked on creating Mizo alphabets based on Roman script. After only two and half months, Savidge started the first school on 1 April 1894. Their first and only pupils were Suaka and Thangphunga. The first book in Mizo Mizo Zir Tir Bu (A Lushai Primer) was released on 22 October 1895. They translated and published the Gospels of Luke and John, and Acts of the Apostles. They also prepared A Grammar and Dictionary of the Lushai language (Dulien Dialect) which they published in 1898, and became the foundation of Mizo language. =Mission to Arunachalis= The Arthington Mission mandated that the missionaries should move to new fields, and handed over its field to Welsh Presbyterian Mission in 1897. The Welsh Mission objected to the continued service of Savidge and Lorrain because of their Baptist persuasion. They left Aizawl for England on 31 December 1897. After taking up a brief course of medicine, they ventured back to India in the name of Assam Frontier Pioneer Mission, an independent mission. They first worked at Sadya in Assam (now Arunachal Pradesh) among the Abor and Miri tribes. They prepared Gospels in their language, and compiled the Abor-Miri Dictionary. =Baptist mission to southern Mizoram= Since the Welsh Mission managed only the northern part of Mizoram, the Baptist Missionary Society of London adopted the new field. The experienced Baptist workers Savidge and Lorrain were the immediate choice. They accepted the appointment and arrived in Lunglei on 13 March 1903 and settled at Serkawn. This marked the establishment of Baptist Church in Mizoram. For effective administration Savidge took up education and social works, while Lorrain pursued pastoral and translation works. They both got married during this period. The Savidges were fully devoted to school management, theology classes, medical centre and social services. Their educational works were a tremendous success that by 1921 there were already fifteen schools with 421 students in the region. The medical services were strengthened as a small dispensary in 1919 with the help new missionaries. The dispensary ultimately developed into the present day Christian Hospital Serkawn. The present Baptist Higher Secondary School, Serkawn, was established as an extension of Savidge's school. Evangelism in Mizoram was recorded as the most successful development in any BMS field in the 20th century. Between 1919 and 1924, the total Baptist community increased from 3,670 to 8,770, and church membership from 1,017 to 3,198. Honorific names Savidge and Lorrain were given an honorific title Zosap (meaning \\"Mizo Sahib\\" or \\"respected master\\". Note that \\"sahib\\" was adopted from a Hindi title meaning \\"master\\") because of their services to Mizos. When David Evan Jones from the Welsh Mission arrived in 1897 to take over the mission, Mizo called the young Welshman \\"Zasapthara\\" (meaning \\"the new/fresh Mizo Sahib\\"), Jones automatically became \\"Zasaphluia\\" (\\"the older Mizo Sahib\\"), and Savidge became \\"Sap Upa\\" (simply \\"old Sahib\\") as he was the oldest. Lorrain, on the other hand, due to his different complexion became \\"Pu Buanga\\" (\\"Mr Grey\\"). They were known only by their new names among the Mizos. Later years Savidge became poorer in health and retired in 1925. He left Mizoram on 13 April 1925 for England. He brought home a soil from Serkawn to be buried with him. He lived in London, but his health was worsened by diabetes mellitus. After long suffering he died on 28 September 1935. ReferencesFurther reading *Mizorama missionary hmasa ber: Rev. Dr. F.W.

Ichthyol Res (2018) 65: 471. Its specific name honors the zoologist Franz Hermann Troschel (1810-1882). It is native to the neritic pelagic zone of the shallow water coral reefs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and they are an omnivorous species feeding on plankton and algae attached to their coral habitat. Abudefduf troschelii is a sister- species of A. saxatilis but have diverged from each other since the uplift of the isthmus of Panama, separated by the rise of the Panama land bridge 3.1 to 3.5 million years ago. Males, like in many other marine species, take care of and defend newborn A. troschelii after they have been hatched by eggs from the female. There are currently no major threats to the species and there is no indication of a current decline in its population size. The IUCN Red List lists this damselfish as being of ‚Äúleast concern‚Äù. Physical characteristics Abudefduf troschelii have five dark bands on the lateral surfaces of the body with dorsal yellow spaces in between. These dark bands spread towards the ventral side of the fish creating black stripes. This eye catching coloration of the fish is one of the reasons that they are popular aquarium fishes. Their pectoral fins are lengthened, slender, and paddle- shaped allowing them to swim fast and change direction quickly around coral reefs. This is a common morphology among coral reef living fish. These pectoral fins are structured with a long, straightened hydrodynamic leading edge, and a rounded hydrodynamic trailing edge allowing them to easily maneuver around pieces of rock and coral. Compared to other damselfish, A. troschelii have relatively large eyes, and a long angular shaped head. The mouth of this species is located in a higher position on the frontal side of the fish compared to other damselfish, allowing A. troschelii to successfully feed on suspension floating plankton in the oceanic pelagic zone. Habitat and distribution Abudefduf troschelii are found widely throughout the Eastern Pacific and are endemic to this area. They are commonly found in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and the United States to name a few. In these places, this species is abundant in coralline and sandy bottoms, but they can also be found at rocky bottoms and tide pools where they are usually found in large aggregations. Furthermore, this species can be found in the pelagic area of the neritic feeding on plankton. This neritic area where A. troschelii are commonly found, is made up of massive corals, deep rocky walls, and shallow exposed reef.  Diet  These Eastern Pacific damselfish are feeders whose diet consists mainly of plankton in the pelagic zone and mid-water, but they also graze on benthic invertebrates and algae on their coral reef habitat. These feeding tendencies make them an omnivorous species. The physical structure of the A. troschelii mouth is one that it small but conveniently located so that it can easily feed on small plankton suspended in the water column and small bits of algae attached to pieces of benthic structure.  Reproduction  Abudefduf troschelii spawn within nine days on either side of the new moon, and hatching occurs after four days where newborns are hatched during the hour after sunset. Extended periods of spawning can occur during seasonal increases in plankton productivity. This seasonal increase is due to upwelling and leads to an increase in egg production of the species. During a wet season, this reproductive process lasts three to four days. In a dry season, on the other hand, this process can be drawn out to 8 days. Due to this, reproductive patterns are found within A. troschelii populations particularly during wet seasons. Reproductive patters of this species is beneficial because a hatching taking place at dusk results in favorable tides allowing newborns to be transported away from reef-based predators found at the time of a new moon. Furthermore, reproductive patterns reduces the risk of predation of unhatched embryos found at nests. During this spawning period, the male A. troschelii mates, chosen by the females, will clear and defend spawning sites of pieces of dead coral and rock. This area is where the females will eventually lay their adhesive eggs soon to be defended by the male. Male A. troschelii mate with one to five females for 1 to 3 days resulting in 250,000 eggs, and these males defend the young for 4 to 5 days following the spawning. When the newborn fish are hatched, the young have well-developed eyes and are able to control and utilize directive swimming. Like other damselfishes, larvae spend several weeks in open-water plankton and then settle on reefs as juveniles.  Predators  There are no real major threats to the overall population size of A. troschelii, but they are in fact a small percent of the yellow snapper (Lutjanus argentiventris) diet. Another predator of this species is the Thalassoma lucasanum, the neotropical pacific wrasse, which forms groups of 30 to 300 individuals that will typically overwhelm the parental defense of A. troschelii embryos, ultimately gaining access to an easy unprotected, solitary food source.

The French army was defeated at the Battle of Charleroi and managed to pass only one regiment into Namur as a reinforcement. The forts were destroyed by the bombardment, some being demolished by conventional heavy artillery rather than the siege guns, due to flaws in the concrete protection encasing the forts. The last of the Belgian fortress troops were forced to surrender on 25 August, after the survivors of the Belgian 4th Division had withdrawn to the south through the French Fifth Army and eventually joined the Belgian field army at Antwerp during the siege. Background=Strategic developments=Belgium Belgian military planning was based on an assumption that other powers would eject an invader but the likelihood of a German invasion did not lead to France and Britain being seen as allies or for the Belgian government intending to do more than protect its independence. The Anglo-French Entente (1904) had led the Belgians to perceive that the British attitude to Belgium had changed and that it was seen as a British protectorate. A General Staff was formed in 1910 but the , Lieutenant-G√©n√©ral Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and not replaced until May 1914 by Lieutenant-General Chevalier de Selliers de Moranville, who began planning for the concentration of the army and met railway officials on 29 July. Belgian troops were to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the National redoubt of Belgium ready to face any border, while the Fortified Position of Li√®ge and Fortified Position of Namur were left to secure the frontiers. On mobilization, the King became Commander-in- Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan, the disorganised and poorly trained Belgian soldiers would benefit from a central position, to delay contact with an invader but it would also need fortifications for defence, which were on the frontier. A school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment in line with French theories of the offensive. Belgian plans became a compromise in which the field army concentrated behind the Gete river with two divisions forward at Li√®ge and Namur. Germany German strategy had given priority to offensive operations against France and a defensive posture against Russia since 1891. German planning was determined by numerical inferiority, the speed of mobilisation and concentration and the effect of the vast increase of the power of modern weapons. Frontal attacks were expected to be costly and protracted, leading to limited success, particularly after the French and Russians modernised their fortifications on the frontiers with Germany. Alfred von Schlieffen, Chief of the Imperial German General Staff) from devised a plan to evade the French frontier fortifications with an offensive on the northern flank, which would have a local numerical superiority and obtain rapidly a decisive victory. By such a manoeuvre was intended to pass swiftly through Belgium, between Antwerp and Namur and threaten Paris from the north. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen in 1906 and was less certain that the French would conform to German assumptions. Moltke adapted the deployment and concentration plan to accommodate an attack in the centre or an enveloping attack from both flanks as variants, by adding divisions to the left flank opposite the French frontier, from the which were expected to be mobilised in the (western army). The main German force would still advance through Belgium to attack southwards into France, the French armies would be enveloped on their left and pressed back over the Meuse, Aisne, Somme, Oise, Marne and Seine rivers, unable to withdraw into central France. The French would either be annihilated by the manoeuvre from the north or it would create conditions for victory in the centre or in Lorraine on the common border. =Tactical developments=Namur forts The Meuse valley was a route by which France or Germany could be invaded and after the Franco-Prussian War, General Henri Alexis Brialmont fortified the valley at Li√®ge and Namur, to deter France and Germany from violating Belgian sovereignty. The Fortified Position of Namur (FPN) was built from about from the centre of Namur, to a standard design of triangular and quadrilateral shapes, to minimize the number of defensive batteries in the fort ditches, with the point facing outwards. On the left bank of the Meuse lay the modernised forts of Fort de Malonne, Fort de Saint-H√©ribert and Fort de Suarl√©e, the unmodernised Fort d'Emines and Fort de Cognel√©e and the modernized Fort de Marchovelette. On the right bank were Fort de Maizeret, Fort d'Andoy and Fort de Dave, all modernized. The obsolete Citadel of Namur in the town became redundant. The forts were built of non- reinforced concrete but this could only be poured in daylight, which caused weak joints between each pour. A citadel was built and covered by of concrete; caserne walls which were less vulnerable, had concrete of thickness, inside a defended ditch wide. The entrance had a long access ramp at the rear facing Namur, protected by a tambour with gun embrasures perpendicular to the entry, a rolling drawbridge retracting laterally over a pit equipped with grenade launchers, an entrance grille and a gun firing along the axis of the gate. The forts at Li√®ge and Namur had with each fort equipped with guns of , and calibre, which were the most modern armaments available in 1888, mounted in retractable armoured steel turrets made in France, Belgium and Germany. Three smaller retractable turrets were built in the triangular forts and four in the quadrilateral forts, with guns for short-range defence and guns were mounted in casemates to defend the ditches. The forts of the FPN were built to withstand bombardment by artillery and were equipped with steam-powered electrical generating plant for lights, pumps and searchlights at a cost 29 million francs. The forts had a weaker side to the rear, to allow them to be recaptured by Belgian forces counter-attacking from the rear. Barracks and support facilities were built on the rear side, using the rear ditch for light and ventilation of living spaces. Provision had been made for the daily needs of the fortress troops but the latrines, showers, kitchens and the morgue had been built in the counterscarp, which could become untenable if fumes from exploding shells collected in the living quarters and support areas as the forts were ventilated naturally. Each fort had a detachment of infantry, to sortie from the fort to engage an attacker. Battle of Li√®ge, 4‚Äì16 August The Battle of Li√®ge was the first engagement in the German invasion of Belgium and the first battle of World War I. The attack on the city began on 5 August 1914 and lasted until 16 August, when the last fort was surrendered. Railways needed by the German armies in eastern Belgium, were closed during the early part of the siege and by the morning of 17 August, the German First, Second and Third Armies were free to resume their advance to the French frontier. The Belgian field army withdrew from the Gete towards Antwerp from and Brussels was captured unopposed on 20 August. The siege of Li√®ge lasted for eleven days, rather than the two days anticipated by the Germans. General Karl von B√ºlow the German Second Army commander, established under the command of General Max von Gallwitz with the Guard Reserve Corps, XI Corps taken from the Third Army of General Max von Hausen and a division of the VII Reserve Corps, with which advanced on Namur on 16 August and appeared in strength before Namur on 20 August. The 3rd Army guarded the southern flank along the Meuse and the 2nd Army attacked towards Charleroi, which prevented all but one French regiment from reaching Namur to reinforce the garrison. Prelude=Belgian defensive preparations= Namur was garrisoned by about troops and infantry of the Belgian 4th Division under the command of General Augustin Michel. The Belgians intended to hold the Fortified Position of Namur until relieved by the French Fifth Army. Belgian and German cavalry skirmished to the north of Namur on 5 August and to the south-east two days later. On 19 August the Belgian 8th Brigade at Huy, blew the bridge over the Meuse and retired to Namur, as the German Guard Reserve Corps and XI Corps appeared from the east. =German offensive preparations= B√ºlow ordered General von Gallwitz, commander of the Guard Reserve Corps, to lead the attack on Namur with , while the 3rd Army guarded against an attack by the Allies between Namur and Givet. The super-heavy artillery and engineer units from Li√®ge were sent to Namur along the Meuse valley and the experience gained in the operation against the Fortified Position of Li√®ge, led the attacking troops to take the shortest routes to Namur, which brought the Guard Reserve Corps to the north bank of the Meuse and the XI Corps to the south bank. B√ºlow arrived at the headquarters of Gallwitz on 20 August and insisted that the 1st Guard Reserve Division move further round to the north and north-west of Namur, to protect the left flank of the 2nd Army as it wheeled around the fortress. The division was to cross the river at Andenne but \\"Belgian civilians\\" delayed the passage in street fighting. The 3rd Guard Division was delayed at Hingeon and by a Belgian counter-attack from Cognel√©e. On the south bank XI Corps repulsed Belgian attacks and reached its assembly areas and established a flank guard at Flor√©e. The German artillery arrived late and so the bombardment was postponed until 21 August. The terrain on the south-east front was found to be unsuitable for an attack and the 38th Division was ordered forward to Haltinne and the 22nd Division took over the front of attack, on the south bank of the Meuse. =German plan of attack= After a reconnaissance on 19 August, Gallwitz decided that a was impossible and chose to attack the north-eastern front of the fortress with the 3rd Guard Division between Hingeon and Vezin and the eastern side by the XI Corps, with the 1st Guard Reserve Division in reserve at Andenne. The siege artillery was to be emplaced in the sectors opposite forts Marchovlette, Maizeret and Andoy. As the infantry arrived from H√©ron, Coutisse, Ohey and Hamois it was to assemble at on a line from Franc to Waret, Vezin, Sclayn, Strud and Les Tombs; in the afternoon the artillery was to commence the bombardment. A plan arrived from OHL the same day, with a dossier on the forts and the garrison but Gallwitz chose to conduct the operation according to open warfare techniques rather than pre-war thinking about siege warfare. Air reconnaissance detected Belgian troops at Cognel√©e and pontoon bridges at V√©pion and Arr√™t, either side of Namur and railway traffic to the south-west heading for the fortress. The Belgians had used the time taken by the siege of Li√®ge to build field fortifications between the forts, particularly on the most vulnerable parts of the perimeter from the north to the south-east. Siege=Bombardment= The bombardment on 21 August was interrupted by fog and by noon the artillery on the north-east and south-east fronts had only fired on forts Marchovelette, Maizeret, Andoy and the intervening ground. The Belgian reply had been meagre and the 1st Guard Reserve Division advanced to the area of Hemptinne and Meeffe. The 3rd Guard Division reached the edges of the villages of Marchovelette, Gelbress√©e and Wartet, the 22nd Division reached a line near Thon, Goyet and Faulx and the 38th Division reached Andenne. Scrutiny of the ground to the east and south- east of Namur found that it was full of steep ravines and unsuitable for attack, which led Gallwitz to reduce the attack there to a feint and ordered the 38th Division to move to the north bank by the next day. Rainy weather hampered German photographic reconnaissance aircraft but the 1st Guard Reserve and 38th divisions were to make the main attack between Daussoulx and Gelbress√©e, as the 3rd Guard Division waited in reserve. The artillery was directed to commence firing on fort Cognel√©e. On 22 August the Belgian defenders made two counter-attacks and the 3rd Guard Division was drawn into fighting near Marchovelette, which disorganised the attack and led to a delay until the next day. The bombardment continued, with the artillery commanders being certain that the effect had been devastating and the infantry commanders, engineers and air crews pointing out that return fire from the Belgian forts and intermediate positions had not diminished. =Attack= Gallwitz ordered the attack to begin in the north-east and north on 23 August, under the command of Lieutenant-General von Pl√ºskow the XI Corps commander. The siege artillery was to suppress the Belgian fortress artillery, as infantry and engineers attacked the intermediate defences supported by the medium and field artillery. After the first attack, the northern fringe of Namur was to be occupied up to the line of the Gembloux‚ÄìNamur‚ÄìHuy railway. Pl√ºskow argued for a delay until it was certain that the bombardment of the forts had succeeded but Gallwitz refused. The attack began and by a report that the 3rd Guard Division had captured the defences east of fort Cognel√©e arrived and Pl√ºskow ordered the rest of the units in his sector to attack. At the defences either side of fort Marchovelette fell and return fire from the fort and from fort Cognel√©e had ceased. Attacks began along the front towards Namur and the reserve of a brigade of the 1st Guard Reserve Division and a regiment of the 38th Division advanced along the Leuze‚ÄìNamur road, as a flank guard against interference from forts Emines and Suarl√©e. Forts Cognel√©e and Marchovelette surrendered by mid-afternoon and the attack into the north of Namur reached the objective at The 14th Reserve Division attacked towards forts Emines and Suarl√©e to divert their fire from the main attack and the 22nd Division bombarded forts Maizeret and Andoy until the afternoon, when the infantry closed up to the intermediate positions. At Gallwitz sent an envoy to the Namur garrison commander, to demand the surrender of the town and remaining forts by or the town and citadel would be bombarded. Pl√ºskow was ordered to be ready to begin barrage-fire to the south of Namur, to prevent reinforcements reaching the defenders or a retirement by the garrison. No reply was received by the deadline but to avoid a street battle during the night only a bombardment on the citadel and southern part of the town began. The bombardment ceased after fifteen minutes as some of the troops in the north of the town pressed on beyond the railway line. Gallwitz ordered the rest of the infantry to advance to the Sambre and Meuse, which was unopposed but as the infantry reached the river, all but a small bridge over the Sambre were blown. Troops in the town reported that the Belgian 4th Division had retreated to the south when the German attack had overrun the fortress line. During the night the German troops maintained their positions, ready to resume the attack in the morning. German preparations to resume the attack on 24 August were complete by and the super-heavy artillery resumed the bombardment of forts Emine and Suarl√©e. Troops in the town repaired the bridges over the Meuse and Sambre. Fort Maizeret had fallen the day before to the 22nd Division and Gallwitz ordered the 38th Division to advance into the broken country to the south-west of Namur, to attack forts Malonne and St. H√©ribert. The 3rd Guard Division was to take the rest of the town and the 1st Guard Reserve Division was to guard the artillery positions north of the Meuse, as forts Emines and Suarl√©e were bombarded. The 14th Reserve Division was to prevent a breakout to the west or south-west and the 22nd Division was to take forts Andoy and Dave, then advance to the Meuse. The 3rd Guard Division took the rest of Namur during the morning and the fall of fort Andoy. Malonne was taken by coup de main and the 38th Division closed up to the fort. In the evening the 38th Division took fort St. H√©ribert and forts Emines, Dave and Suarl√©e were captured on 25 August. Aftermath=Analysis= The German Official Historians wrote in Der Weltkrieg, that the swift capture of Namur had made the French position in the angle of the Sambre and Meuse rivers untenable. The success was ascribed to the skill of Gallwitz, who reconciled the demands of open and siege warfare, with a plan which was far more effective than the methods used at Li√®ge. The attack on Namur was faster, needed fewer troops and was less costly in casualties, despite the three weeks which the defenders had had to prepare their defences. The Germans reversed the tactics used at Li√®ge and waited for the siege train from Li√®ge to bombard the forts, before attacking with infantry. Bombardment made the rear ditches of the forts untenable and the attackers were able to get between the forts and attack them from the rear. The defenders were driven into the citadel, where there were insufficient sanitary facilities for and the air became unbreathable, while the German artillery destroyed the forts with plunging fire from the super- heavy howitzers and from the rear. It was found to be impossible to make sorties from the forts under German artillery fire but German shells and more for large pieces, missed the forts. The fortress guns were less powerful than the German guns but were more accurate and could take advantage of observation and fire support provided by neighbouring forts. During the night of 24 August, the Reserve Guard Corps and XI Corps were ordered to move south and rejoin the 2nd and 3rd armies. =Casualties= The Belgian army had of whom from the 4th Division, which withdrew to the south behind the French Fifth Army. The division was moved to Le Havre and then by sea to Ostend, arriving on 27 August and then re-joined the field army at Antwerp. The German Official History recorded the taking of and French prisoners, the capture of twelve field guns and that some elements of the 4th Division who had left the fortress at the last moment were captured south of Namur. The Germans had of whom killed.

The transmission brake is the yellow drum, to the right rear of the transfer box. A transmission brake or driveline parking brake is an inboard vehicle brake that is applied to the drivetrain rather than to the wheels. Historically, some early cars used transmission brakes as the normal driving brake and often had wheel brakes on only one axle, if that. In current vehicles, these brakes are now rare. They are found in some makes, notably Land Rover, usually for light off-road vehicles. Simple transmission brakes could be found in large vehicles too, such as the 16 inch single disc parking brake used in the M19 Tank Transporter of World War II. . Such a system was also used on the HMMWV. The transmission brake is provided solely as a parking brake or handbrake. Normal wheel brakes are still provided for use when driving, drum brakes originally, now almost always disc brakes. Driver's manuals usually caution against using the transmission brake when driving, as it is neither powerful enough nor robust enough and so will not work effectively and may even be damaged by trying to stop a moving vehicle. Transmission brakes use drum brakes, rather than disc brakes, as they are intended as a static parking brake, rather than a high performance dynamic brake. Drum brakes allow simpler adjustment with cable-actuated hand lever mechanisms. The brake is mounted to the rear output shaft of the transfer box. As the transmission brake is mounted inboard of the final drive and its reduction gearing, the brake rotates relatively faster, but with less torque, than a wheel brake. The apparently undersized transmission brake thus has more holding ability than its small size might suggest, but is less suitable for driving loads. The braking forces would also be passed through the final drive and axle drive shafts, with possible risk of overloading them. One advantage of a transmission brake is that it locks the entire drivetrain, including all four wheels of a four wheel drive vehicle. However any differential action, either within an axle or front-to-back on an all wheel drive (permanent 4√ó4) vehicle can still allow movement. For this reason a transmission brake is convenient as a parking brake, but should not be relied upon if a mechanic is to be working beneath the vehicle and wheel chocks should be used instead. A second advantage is that they remove the need to provide cable connections to the wheel brakes, on off-road vehicles where such may be prone to damage.  Automatic transmissions  Pawl transmission brake, inside an automatic transmission A form of transmission brake is commonly fitted to automatic transmissions. These brakes use a dog clutch or pawl system, rather than friction linings. They thus provide a simple and positive lock when stationary, but cannot (or at least, should not) be engaged when moving. In the USA, this is the conventional form of parking brake and leads to the handbrake being almost entirely ignored and thought of only as the 'emergency' brake.

The word, Bhuman, is derived from the word, Bahu, meaning much or many, with the suffix ‚Äì imam, added after it by dropping ‚Äì i, to impart the sense of the abstract noun. This word refers directly to the Supreme Self who is superior to Prana though Prana is Bhuman because of proximity where the vow of Prana, consisting in transcending all other thing is alluded to. Brahman has avyama ('unlimited extension in terms of space'); it is sarvagata ('omnipresent'), ananta ('infinite'); it is called Bhuman ('plenitude') and is nirvayava or ('without parts') and arupvad ('formless'), and eternal because it is aksara ('imperishable'). Brahman is Bhuman, the plenitude which transcends the sum of its parts and yet fully inheres in them. The quality of being the Bhuman (plenitude) etc.; ascribed by the ≈örutis agrees well with the highest Self, which is the cause of everything. Brahman resides in its entirety within the smallest particle imaginable and yet remains the ayatana, the receptacle, or bhuman, the totality which transcends the sum of these parts. Bhuman is not the human soul, the companion of Prana; Bhuman is ƒÄnanda (Bliss), immense joy. Samprasada also refers to the released soul. The consideration of happiness induces and impels man to perform actions, had he experienced unhappiness in his pursuit he would not have gone in for the actions at all; but real happiness is that which one enjoys in the vision of the Infinite. The Doctrine of Ananda (Bliss) is central to the philosophy of Vedanta. Ananda conveys a sense of infinite, eternal, absolute happiness and not selfish pleasure which is transitory gratification but a state of absolute expansion called Bhuman. Bhuman is illimitation. Ananda, the supreme pleasure, is in illimitation and not in the limited (alpa). :‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§µ‡•à ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ‡§Ç, ‡§®‡§æ‡§≤‡•ç‡§™‡•á ‡§∏‡•Å‡§ñ‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§ø Bhuman is that happiness.Chandogya Upanishad VII.xxii-xxv Brahman is the Absolute to be distinguished from Prajapati and from Prana, the Vital force, directly identified with life (ayuh) and consciousness (Prajna).

Panini explains that the word, Bhuman, is derived from the word Bahu meaning much; many, with the suffix imam added after it by dropping ‚Äì i to impart the sense of the abstract noun. Adi Sankara in his Bhasya states that this word is introduced without discarding Prana to mean Prana is Brahman. But, here the instruction is that Bhuman is superior to Prana therefore Prana cannot be Brahman because from Brahman proceeds Prana (Chandogya Upanishad VII.xxvi.1). According to Madhava, Bhuman is that which is beyond all and not merely beyond Prana alone; if it is something subsequent to Prana it cannot be Brahman.

It is based on the memoirs of Rebecca Yancey Williams and set in Lynchburg, Virginia, from 1913 to 1929. Synopsis Based on the true story of turn-of-the-century Robert Yancey, lawyer and ever-popular politician in Virginia. The film starts with the statement, \\"This is the story of a vanishing era when simple men so loved their country, their families and their friends that America became a better place in which to live. Such a man was Cap'n Bob Yancey.\\" The film is based on a 1940 memoir of the same name by Rebecca Yancey Williams. The book's central figure was her father, Robert Davis Yancey, and detailed the story of Cap'n Bob Yancey, his charming and absent‚Äêminded wife and all the Yancey children. The film explores societal roles in plantations of the \\"Old Dominion\\" around Lynchburg and their socio-economic implications, as well as the movement for women‚Äôs suffrage, among other things. It is also the town's story, and various eminent Virginians cross the pages, including Carter Glass, General Jubal Early, Lady Astor's father, \\"Chilly\\" Langhorne, and others. Katharine Alexander portrays an outspoken woman who moved north and got a divorce; the character is held to be loosely based on Nancy Langhorne Astor.

Trivia A promotional poster for the film makes the claim that \\"Millions Read the Book\\", and also refers to the film as an \\"American Masterpiece\\" having \\"Heart-Throbs, Laughs, [and] Thrills\\". In addition, a 1942 issue of Photoplay referred to the book as \\"delightful\\". The Vanishing Virginian, the book the film is based on, was published a second time in London in 1941, this time under the title Father Was a Handful. This version was published by Michael Joseph, a british writer and publisher who was part of the publishing company that would later become Penguin Random House. The story told in The Vanishing Virginian is continued in Rebecca Yancey Williams' second and final novel Carry Me Back, which further chronicles the life of the family, focusing on Rebecca Yancey Williams' experiences during the country summers of 1913-14 in Lynchburg. In addition, some of the content in this novel was adapted from Williams' own diary she kept when she was 15 years of age.

It consists of three arches flanked by lodges and is in Ionic style. The entrance was designed by Lewis Hornblower, with amendments by Joseph Paxton, the designer of the park. The park, and its entrance, were opened in 1847. The Grand Entrance is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History Birkenhead Park was the first park in the world to be developed from public funds. It was designed by Joseph Paxton and its construction was supervised by Edward Kemp. Paxton appointed Lewis Hornblower to design the Grand Entrance. His plans were accepted by the Road and Improvement Committee in May 1845, but Paxton was not happy with them and made changes. The Grand Entrance was built by John and William Walker of Birkenhead between 1845 and 1847. The park, with its Grand Entrance, was opened on 5 April 1847 by Lord Morpeth, on the same day that Birkenhead Docks were opened. Description The Grand Entrance is built in ashlar stone, and is in Ionic style. It consists of three arches flanked by a pair of lodges. The central arch is the largest, and contains a carriageway, and on either side there are smaller arches for pedestrians. The whole structure is about high. The central arch is flanked by pairs of unfluted columns, and above it is a decorative attic containing the arms of the town and the date. The lodges are identical, in two storeys, and with three bays separated by pilasters. They have sash windows, and at the tops there are balustraded parapets. Appraisal The Grand Entrance was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 29 June 1950. Grade II* is the middle of the three grades and is granted to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". Hartwell and colleagues comment in the Buildings of England series that it is \\"grand indeed\\". The park itself is designated at Grade I in the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It influenced the design of Central Park in New York, which opened in 1858.

Prestonville is a largely residential area in the northwest of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. It covers a long, narrow and steeply sloping ridge of land between the Brighton Main Line and Dyke Road, two major transport corridors which run north-northwestwards from the centre of Brighton. Residential development started in the 1860s and spread northwards, further from central Brighton, over the next six decades. The area is characterised by middle-class and upper-middle-class housing in various styles, small-scale commercial development and long eastward views across the city. Two Anglican churches serve Prestonville‚Äîone at each end of the area‚Äîand there are several listed buildings. Brighton and Hove City Council describe the area as a \\"pre-1914 residential inner suburb whose street pattern, architecture and character have been well preserved\\", giving a \\"strong sense of place\\". \\"High-quality\\" Victorian buildings can be found amongst the housing, and two residential streets consist of a homogeneous \\"railway suburb\\" built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway to rehouse people displaced from around Brighton station when the company extended its goods yard. While not successful in this aim, the estate left \\"a legacy of good-quality housing\\" which still survives. Location and topography In this view from Tenantry Down, the suburb of Prestonville runs across the background below the skyline, and its position on the side of a high ridge is apparent. Prestonville covers a sloping ridge of land on the western side of the valley through which London Road and the Brighton Main Line run. The land drops down steeply from Dyke Road, the ancient route to Devil's Dyke on the South Downs. Now one of the city's major roads, it formed the historic boundary between the parishes of Hove and Preston. Later, when Preston became part of Brighton, Dyke Road formed the border between the Boroughs of Hove and Brighton. The centre of Brighton is about 1.2 miles (2 km) to the southeast, and central Hove lies to the southwest. Anticlockwise from the south, the boundaries of Prestonville are defined as Seven Dials, Chatham Place, Howard Place, the Brighton Main Line between Brighton and Preston Park stations, Tivoli Crescent North and Dyke Road. Old Shoreham Road, a major road at the southern end of Prestonville, formed the northern boundary of Brighton Borough, and therefore the boundary between Brighton and Preston parishes, until 1873. Prestonville has good tree cover in the form of mature street-planted trees, but open space within the area is lacking. Dyke Road Park and Preston Park are nearby though. Long views eastwards and southeastwards across the city can be obtained from many streets in the area, particularly in the northern section. When Prestonville was developed in the 19th century, although southern parts of the area were very close to Brighton railway station and its locomotive works, its attractiveness for residential development was not affected because the prevailing wind blew smoke and pollution in the opposite direction. History OpenStreetMap of the Prestonville area. The arrow points North. The ancient parish of Preston, a area of arable land cut through by the valley of the Wellesbourne, was the first parish north of both Hove and Brighton. Old Shoreham Road, now a major route through the southern part of Prestonville, formed the boundary. St Peter's Church (the old parish church) and Preston Manor were on the east side of the valley. The western boundary was formed by Dyke Road, which led to Devil's Dyke on the South Downs. Preston parish became part of the parliamentary borough of Brighton and Hove in 1868 and was added to the municipal borough of Brighton five years later as Brighton's urban development spread northwards, encouraged by its \\"rapid growth as Britain's premier seaside resort\\". Prestonville's development contributed to an increase in population in Preston parish from 756 at the time of the 1841 census to 2,470 30 years later. The tithe map of Preston parish before it became urbanised shows that most of the land between Dyke Road and the future route of the railway line was owned by Thomas Stanford and farmed by his son Thomas junior. Thomas senior himself farmed a field in the southeast corner of present-day Prestonville, and another by the Old Shoreham Road‚ÄìDyke Road junction was owned by Sir Isaac Goldsmid, 1st Baronet. A post mill called Port Hall Mill, next to the house called Port Hall, existed between 1795 and 1887. Another mill, Preston Mill, occupied the present site of Old Mill Works in Highcroft Villas between 1797 and 1881. Before 1797 it stood on the land now occupied by Regency Square on Brighton seafront. Two paintings of 36 yoke of oxen transporting it up the hill to its new location can be found in Preston Manor. Later names for the mill included Trusler's, Black and Streeter's Mill. Waterhall Mill at Patcham contains some of the machinery salvaged when it was demolished. The northward growth of housing into this area began in the 1840s after the opening of Brighton railway station. The West Hill and Seven Dials areas were built up with housing, then between 1848 and 1858 roads such as Chatham Place, Russell Crescent, Howard Terrace and the southern part of Prestonville Road were laid out. Old Shoreham Road had not been reached by this time, though. North of the road was an area of farmland on the west side of the Wellesbourne valley, cut off by the Brighton Main Line from Preston village, the church and the manor house. The land belonged to New England Farm, established in the 1810s south of Old Shoreham Road (therefore in the parish of Brighton), and an abattoir had been proposed to be sited there. A developer called Daniel Friend bought the land, however, and laid it out with middle-class housing from the 1860s. He bought about of land from the London and Brighton Railway, who had in turn acquired it in about 1839 (just before the railway line was laid out) from William Stanford of Preston Manor. In the early days of the railways, it was common for the newly formed railway companies to buy more land than they needed and to sell the remainder for residential development. The Prestonville Arms pub is in the older southern part of Prestonville. The earliest streets developed north of Old Shoreham Road were the northern section of Prestonville Road, Prestonville Terrace, Hamilton Road (on which stands the Prestonville Arms pub), Hamilton Terrace, Brigden Street and the lower section of Stanford Road, all of which date from between 1865 and 1869. York Grove, built on the site of the New England Farm buildings, predated these streets by about five years. (The main farmhouse, built before 1820 in a Classical style with a prominent Doric-columned porch, was retained and is numbered as 26 York Grove.) Ribbon development spread north along Dyke Road during the 1870s, reaching Highcroft Villas which was itself built up from 1880. The 1880s was a period of major development in Prestonville, as the land around an 18th-century house called Port Hall was developed with housing. Coventry Street, Exeter Street, Port Hall Street, Upper Hamilton Road and the northern part of Stanford Road date from this time. Four more roads‚ÄîBuxton, Chatsworth, Lancaster and Stafford‚Äîwere built during the 1890s. Further north, the roads bounded by Dyke Road, Highcroft Villas, The Drove and the railway line date from the last five years of the 19th century, and the area northwards towards Tivoli Crescent North was completed by the start of World War I. Millers Road, one of the roads from this era, was named after the former Preston Mill, as was the Dyke Tavern pub on Dyke Road (originally the Windmill Inn). The 1871 census shows that many of the early residents of Prestonville were railway workers based at Brighton station or the nearby Brighton railway works; other occupations included schoolteachers, managers, a tax inspector, a retired admiral, a bookseller and a draper's assistant. Two houses on Hamilton Road were used as an orphans' home and a private school respectively. At this time, much of the housing was rented, and \\"a move from one street to the next could represent a climb in social status\\". In ascending order of social position at this time were Brigden Street, Prestonville Terrace, Hamilton Road and Stanford Road. Many of the houses on Compton Road and Inwood Crescent were built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) soon after 1900 to house families displaced from the streets around Brighton station. In 1898, the LBSCR received permission to compulsorily purchase 171 houses and demolish them to allow Brighton station goods yard to be expanded. Clearance of the site took place between 1901 and 1904. The company bought some houses privately as well, bringing the total number of displaced households to 225. The Act of Parliament which permitted the compulsory purchasing obliged the LBSCR to rehouse the people elsewhere in Brighton, based on the terms of the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1890 upon which it was based. The company bought land from the trustees of the Stanford estate in 1901 and 1903 for ¬£5,600 and erected 123 houses and flats of various styles. They were of good quality and were larger than the terraced houses they replaced, but as a rehousing scheme the development failed because very few of the displaced people actually moved there. The houses were still owned by the railways (latterly by British Railways) until 1965. On 25 May 1943, during the Brighton Blitz, four houses on Compton Road were bombed and one resident died. Postwar flats occupy the site of numbers 20‚Äì26. Another bomb just missed Highcroft Villas, landing on the railway line below. The Prestonville area saw little change after the war, although some other houses were demolished in favour of blocks of flats. An example was the former Hove Villa, built in 1840 on Old Shoreham Road but in institutional use from 1899 (first as a psychiatric hospital, then as a private school). It was demolished in 1972 and twin blocks of flats called Prestonville Court were built in its place. Demographics and community Exeter Street Hall, formerly the church hall of St Luke's, was bought in 2012 by Prestonville residents in order to secure it as a resource for the community. At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, Prestonville's population was estimated at 5,616 and a housing density of 56 dwellings per hectare was calculated. Of the housing stock, 31% is terraced housing, 8% semi-detached, 8% detached and 53% flats of various types. Flats in converted houses are prevalent in the area. In terms of tenure, in 2001 66% of dwellings were owned and 34% were rented, mostly from private landlords. According to the council's demographic classification system, the highest proportions of households are defined as \\"suburban privately renting professionals\\" (24%), \\"affluent urban professional flats\\" (21%) and \\"young educated worker flats\\" (14%). For the purposes of local governance, Prestonville is split between Preston Park ward and Withdean ward, two of the 21 local government wards in the city of Brighton and Hove. The boundary runs along Highcroft Villas. As of August 2013, Preston Park ward was represented by three Green Party councillors, and Withdean ward had one Green Party and two Conservative councillors. The Prestonville Community Association is a local community and action group. In 2012, when St Luke's Church put Exeter Street Hall up for sale, members of the community formed an industrial and provident society to \\"secure [it] as community resource for the residents of Prestonville\\" by buying, refurbishing and promoting it. The company offered to sell shares in the building to residents and other interested parties. Prestonville is served by Stanford Junior School, but the nearest pre-school facilities are a mile away and there is no secondary school in the area: it lies within the catchment area of Dorothy Stringer High School and Varndean School. Buildings St Luke's Church () occupies a \\"landmark\\" position at the junction of Old Shoreham Road and Stanford Road in the south of Prestonville, near Seven Dials. This Anglican church was built in 1875 to the design of John Hill. Its Gothic Revival church hall on Exeter Street dates from 1884 and retains its original red-brick exterior. The Church of the Good Shepherd () is at the junction of Dyke Road and The Drove in the north of Prestonville. It was built between 1920 and 1922 and was designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. Both the church and the small brick walls surrounding it are Grade II-listed. It is a brown-brick building in a late and \\"simple\\" interpretation of the Gothic Revival style. The tower and an extra bay to the nave were added in 1925‚Äì27, and the church hall was opened by George Tryon, 1st Baron Tryon on 15 July 1936. The church was funded as a memorial to former Vicar of Preston Rev. Gerald Moor. The Al-Quds Mosque () was founded in the 1970s when a group of Muslims who were visiting the area donated money to fund an Islamic centre and mosque. The community bought a converted house which had been used as a nursery school. The Booth Museum of Natural History dates from 1874. Two other Grade II-listed buildings are located further south on Dyke Road. The Booth Museum of Natural History was built in 1874 to house the extensive collection of British birds, insects and other specimens collected by naturalist Edward Booth. It originally stood in the grounds of his home, Bleak House, and became a museum in 1890. Many more collections have been added to the stock of over half a million specimens, and in 1998 the museum was designated as a \\"collection of national importance\\". Architecturally, the long, low, shed-like building has an Italianate/Romanesque Revival exterior with polychrome brickwork. Set into a full-width brick porch are two arched doorways with voussoirs. (Bleak House itself was demolished 1939; flats called Elm Court and Fairways occupy the site.) At the junction of Port Hall Road and Dyke Road is Port Hall, a double-fronted house dating from the early 19th century. Prominent four-centred arches surround the doorway and the windows, and above the first floor runs a parapet with battlements and a frieze. The name is set into a panel on the parapet. former board school. Prestonville has two educational buildings of architectural interest. The Grade II-listed Stanford Road School, a primary school which was built in 1893 as one of \\"a distinguished group of board schools\\" designed by Thomas Simpson and his son Gilbert Murray Simpson for the Brighton and Preston School Board. The exterior is lavish, featuring brown and red brick, stone, tile and render, elaborate arched windows, many gables, a clock tower and a wooden bell-cot; and the interior \\"retains its original plan and detailed features\\". At the corner of Old Shoreham Road and Dyke Road is the Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College (BHASVIC), which is on Brighton and Hove City Council's register of locally listed buildings. The \\"splendid\\" former grammar school was designed by London architect S.B. Russell in 1913, extended in 1934‚Äì35 by John Leopold Denman, and made DDA-compliant in 2005 with some \\"adroitly, boldly handled\\" access ramps designed by Nick Evans Architects. It is a Neo-Georgian/Queen Anne-style complex with extensive red brickwork and wings joined to a central section by a series of staircases lit by round windows), and occupies a prominent corner site. It retains its original iron gates with the emblems of Hove and Brighton Boroughs and East and West Sussex. The Quebec Army Reserve Centre at 198 Dyke Road is home to the B (Royal Sussex) Company of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. There is also an Army Cadet Force hut on the premises at which the Brighton detachment of the Army Cadet Force meets. The Quebec Army Reserve Centre was built during World War II as an army drill hall; after the war the Territorial Army moved out of their smaller accommodation in central Brighton and it became their headquarters. Transport A Route 77 service operated by an open top bus travels southwards down Dyke Road in August 2013. Prestonville has convenient access to rail services. Brighton railway station is near the southeast corner of the area. Its dramatically curving train shed can be seen from some of the nearby terraced streets. At the northeast corner of the area is Preston Park railway station, the first station outside Brighton on the main line to London. There is a rear entrance to the station at the junction of Woodside Avenue and Tivoli Crescent North. The railway line runs at a much lower level below the ridge and forms the eastern boundary of the Prestonville area. Bus routes operated by the Brighton & Hove Bus Company operate along Dyke Road. Route 27 runs between Westdene and Saltdean via Brighton station, Old Steine and Rottingdean. Some services on routes 14 and 14C run along Dyke Road on their journeys between Hangleton and Peacehaven. The weekend-only route 77 service between Brighton Pier and Devil's Dyke runs approximately every 45 minutes along the whole length of Dyke Road. Bus journeys to the centre of Brighton take around 10 minutes. Car ownership in Prestonville is lower than the city average, and the proportion of people who walk to work is 22%. Dyke Road is often congested at peak times, and the section of Old Shoreham Road running through the New England railway bridge is another pinch point. Links to the east across the railway line are poor: other than the bridge at the south end of the area, there is the Dyke Road Drive overbridge near the centre and a narrow tunnel towards the north. When Brighton and Hove City Council introduced the first phase of the city's 20 mph zones in April 2013, the southern part of Prestonville as far north as Highcroft Villas was included and therefore became subject to this speed limit. The rest of Prestonville, except Dyke Road, is to be included in Phase 2. People associated with Prestonville Inventor Magnus Volk lived at 128 Dyke Road towards the end of his life. Sculptor and artist Eric Gill was born at 32 Hamilton Road in 1882 and spent his childhood nearby at 53 Highcroft Villas. Theatre manager Charles B. Cochran was born at 15 Prestonville Road in 1872.

She was the eldest daughter of James Emslie, advocate and Deputy Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland. She was educated at Edinburgh Ladies' College. She enrolled at the University of Edinburgh and trained in the women's medical school, spending her hospital residence years at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In 1910, she graduated with a degree in medicine and, in 1912, was awarded her MD with a thesis titled \\"Wassermann sero-diagnosis of syphilis in 200 cases of insanity\\". Career While completing her thesis, she worked as a pathologist at the Stirling District Asylum, and then moved to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children before becoming the first woman to be appointed in charge of the women medicine of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. In 1915, she joined the Scottish Women's Hospitals Organisation and served in France (Domaine de Chanteloup, Sainte-Savine, near Troyes) and then with the Armee d'Orient in Salonika, distinguishing herself by leading the unit which accompanied the Serbian army during the First World War. Following the closure of the Serbian hospital where she worked, she took over Lady Muriel Paget's mission in Crimea. In this role, she brought several orphaned children to Constantinople (now Istanbul) and organised relief for Russian refugees. In 1928, she published With a Woman's Unit in Serbia, Salonika and Sebastopol, an account of these years. For her work during this period, she was awarded the Serbian orders of the White Eagle and St. Sava, the French Croix de Guerre, and the Order of St. Anna of Russia. On her return to Edinburgh in 1920, she was reinstated to her former post at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital but resigned the position after her marriage the following year to Major Thomas Hutton. She then moved to London, working as a researcher the Maudsley Hospital which led to a research paper with Sir Frederick Mott, and honorary consultancies at the Maudsley and the West End Hospital for Nervous Disease. In 1940, she published Mental Disorders in Modern Life, drawing on her experience from these roles.

Plot summary When several dysfunctional and unpublished writers accept young Hannah into their clique, they don't expect her overnight success. Hannah, who has rarely even read a book, let alone written one, not only manages to land a literary agent to represent her, she cashes in on a deal to turn her first manuscript into a Hollywood film. The support of her weekly writers group, Authors Anonymous, turns to resentment. Colette Mooney receives rejection letters galore from agents and publishers. Her husband, optician Alan, speaks ideas into a hand- held recorder all day long, but never acts on them. Henry Obert has writer's block, as well as a huge crush on Hannah, while a Tom Clancy wanna-be, John K.

Results from the Hearings have been presented to key decision makers at both national and European levels for their consideration and further action. History=1996‚Äì2001= The Agency was established in 1996 as an initiative of the Danish Government, endorsed by the member states‚Äô Education Ministers. The establishment of the Agency took place at the end of the European Commission's Helios II programme Helios II EC programme: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:1999:098:0035:0037:EN:PDF and reflected the need for a permanent and systematic structure for European collaboration in the field of special needs and inclusive education. In 1999, following a three-year trial period funded by the Danish education authorities, the Agency was transferred to the member states. This formally established the Agency as a European organisation with the mandate to act as its member states‚Äô platform for collaboration in the field of special needs and inclusive education. Agency history: https://www.european- agency.org/about-us/who-we-are/historyAgency history: http://ec.europa.eu/education/jean-monnet/institutions_en.htm In 1999 another Agency office was established in Brussels. Between 1997 and 2001 the Agency's work focused on creating a platform for co-operation at European level through the national networks built up in all countries. During this period, the European Commission supported concrete activities aimed at analysing and disseminating key information in the field of special needs education across Europe. =2002‚Äì2006= By this time the work was focused on firmly consolidating and strengthening the Agency's position as the platform for co- operation at European level. Co-operation activities took place with European and international organisations. The Agency website was expanded and national networks were extended in all countries through the involvement of nominated national experts participating in the Agency projects. The Agency benefited from an operating grant from 2002 until 2004. In 2004, the Agency was included in the Decision No 791/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the CouncilDecision No 791/2004/EC: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/lex/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:138:0031:0039:EN:PDF, this decision provided a legal basis for the Agency and ensured the provision of an operating grant until 2006. =Since 2007= The Agency now has 31 member countries. The newest members are Bulgaria and Serbia, who joined in 2017 and 2018. Since 2007 the Agency has been one of six European institutions supported with an operating grant under the Jean Monnet initiative within the EU Lifelong Learning Programme 2007‚Äì2013 and similarly under the Jean Monnet initiativeAgency supported by the Jean Monnet Programme: http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-programme/doc88_en.htm within the new EU Erasmus+Erasmus + EU programme for education, Training, Youth and Sport for 2014-2020 http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/index_en.htm education programme (2014-2020). In terms of thinking, implementation and language usage, the concept ‚Äòspecial needs education‚Äô has shifted towards ‚Äòinclusive education‚Äô. Similarly, the way of thinking about learners‚Äô needs has moved from the concept of ‚Äòspecial educational needs‚Äô towards ‚Äòadditional needs‚Äô and the Agency's work is focused on improving education systems to accommodate the needs of all learners. The Agency's original name was European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education. The current name ‚Äì European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education ‚Äì formally came into effect as of 1 January 2014 to better reflect the Agency's current and future activities. =2018= In the Council Recommendations of 22 May 2018 on promoting common values, inclusive education, and the European dimension of teaching https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018H0607(01)&from;=EN (2018/C 195/01), the Council of the European Union encourages member states to promote inclusive education for all learners and ‚Ä≥make effective use of the European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education, on a voluntary basis, to implement and monitor successful inclusive approaches in their education systems.‚Ä≥ (page 4) The Council Recommendations also refer member States to a number of Union instruments and organisations, including the Agency: ‚Ä≥Ensuring effective equal access to quality inclusive education for all learners, including those of migrant origins, those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, those with special needs and those with disabilities ‚Äî in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ‚Äî is indispensable for achieving more cohesive societies. In this endeavour, Member States could benefit from existing Union instruments, notably Erasmus+, the European Structural and Investment Funds, Creative Europe, Europe for Citizens, the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, the European Solidarity Corps and Horizon 2020, as well as the guidance and expertise of the European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education.‚Ä≥ (page 3) =2019= The 2019 Council Recommendation on High Quality Early Childhood Education and Care Systems https://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?qid=1560184974501&uri;=CELEX:32019H0605(01) includes clear advice to use the Agency as a resource. It says: ‚ÄòPromote transparent and coherent monitoring and evaluation of early childhood education and care services at the appropriate levels with a view to policy development and implementation. Effective approaches could include ... implementing existing tools to improve the inclusiveness of early childhood education and care provision such as the Inclusive Early Childhood Education Learning Environment Self-Reflection Tool https://www.european- agency.org/resources/publications/inclusive-early-childhood-education- environment-self-reflection-tool developed by the European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education.'

In optics, pinholes with diameter between a few micrometers and a hundred micrometers are used as apertures in optical systems. Pinholes are commonly used to spatially filter a beam (such as a laser beam), where the small pinhole acts as a low- pass filter for spatial frequencies in the image plane of the beam. A small pinhole can act as a lens, focusing light. This effect is used in pinhole cameras and camera obscura. This effect is also used in pinhole occluders, which are used by ophthalmologists, orthoptists and optometrists to test visual acuity. The same principle has also been applied as an alternative to corrective lenses: a screen of pinholes is mounted on an eyeglass frame and worn as pinhole glasses. Besides pinholes made by the point of a pin, precision commercial pinholes are often made by laser drilling through a thin foil.

It was founded in 1990 as Daly Genik. Daly has taught architecture and is a fellow at the American Institute of Architects (FAIA). Kevin Daly Daly received his Bachelor of Architecture degree from the UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design and his Master of Architecture degree from the Rice University School of Architecture. Daly began his career a designer at Hodgetts + Fung and then an associate at Frank O. Gehry and Partners (1986-1989). Daly was selected as one of eight \\"Emerging Voices\\" by the Architectural League of New York (1999) and held distinguished visiting chairs at both the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning (2001) and Berkeley CED (2007-8). Daly currently teaches at UCLA and has taught at USC, SCI-Arc, Arizona State, and other architecture schools. He has lectured at Stanford, Cornell, Rice University and RISD. Daly was selected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 2012 and serves on AIA awards juries. Exhibitions and recognitions KDA's work has been exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), shown most recently in \\"A New Sculpturalism: Contemporary Architecture from Southern California\\" (2013). The SFMOMA acquired original drawings and models of one of the firm's earliest projects, The Topanga Canyon House, for their permanent collection. KDA was on the cover of Metropolis in 1999 and was featured in All American: Innovation in American Architecture in 2001. In 2005 the firm was selected as one of five American architectural practices to be included in Phaidon's 10x10_2, a book featuring 100 of the world's most exceptional architects to have emerged internationally over the past five years. Their work has been noted in the New York Times, Dwell, Architectural Record, the Los Angeles Times, The Architectural Review, A+U, Domus, Azure, and others.  Work  Camino Nuevo High School Camino Nuevo Middle School Camino Nuevo ECC KDA has designed educational, residential and institutional buildings. The firm designed the Camino Nuevo Charter Academy Schools project‚Äî a series of five projects designed over the course of a decade. Architecture critic, Nicolai Ouroussoff, called KDA's the school's design as ‚Äúone of the most inspiring projects built in Los Angeles in years‚Äù and as \\"a thoughtful, low-cost work of architecture that embodies the kind of civic purpose and progressive ideals that so many public institutions give lip service to but rarely fulfill\\". The AIA described Daly's architecture as a combination of ‚Äúinnovation in technology and fabrication, economy and livability, materiality and form‚Äù as executed in the characteristics of an affordable housing apartment complex at 2602 Broadway in Santa Monica (2013). The project uses high-performance, sustainable materials and design elements that offer private, interior spaces for residents along with a \\"community zone\\" that maximizes every corner of the 1.5 acre site. Transforming infill properties, like 2602 Broadway, into buildings that become community landmarks, is characteristic of the firm's public work. According to Daly, architecture can be \\"performative on every level: environmentally, structurally, economically, and aesthetically.\\" The Valley Center House and the Palms Residence are examples of the firm's residential work Daly's practice includes pro bono work; most recently he designed UCLA Medical Center Santa Monica's new Stuart House, a program of the Rape Treatment Center, and was on the advisory board of USC's Center for Sustainable Cities. In 2009, Ouroussoff said that Daly belongs to the younger generation of architects contributing to the country's westward shift from New York to Los Angeles as the center for innovation and creativity in architectural thought (along with established architects Frank Gehry, Thom Mayne, Eric Owen Moss, Robert Mangurian and Craig Hodgetts). KDA projects in process include expansion of the UCLA Ostin Music Center and the new Edison Language Academy for the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District.

Plans In June 2013, the company announced that Network Rail had given the green light to go ahead to the next phase of development and seek private investment. On 11 December 2013, the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead received 1,423 signatures in support of the project. This resulted in the project being discussed at full council on 25 February 2014. A unanimous motion was passed in support of the project, noting the petition, encouraging WLR to engage in the planning process and looking forward to further submissions.http://www.rbwm.gov.uk/minsys3.nsf/AMByPorC/ADD1AC389B55A50C80257C9000331ADA?OpenDocument In August 2014, WLR announced that it had retained Turner & Townsend to run a competition to select an investment partner. In November 2014, a working group of the local planning authority, the Royal Borough of Windsor & Maidenhead, recommended support of the proposals in the borough local plan, provided no substantial harm to heritage assets was verified. This was confirmed by the borough's cabinet on 26 February 2015.http://www.rbwm.gov.uk/minsys3.nsf/AMByPorC/5D1F0DF5A3D830B280257DFC00480025?OpenDocument Also, the local neighbourhood plan included the associated regeneration of the Windsor riverside area in its 'vision day'. The Windsor Observer reported on 31 July 2015 that plans for a public consultation on the Windsor Link Railway have been delayed. This is to allow the rail link to be considered in the wider context of a \\"Windsor regeneration project\\". The WLR plans to link the two stations were rejected in early December 2018 by the Department of Transport.

Consisting of 27 short essays by different authors, the report aims to inform consumers about the impact of meat consumption on global poverty, climate change, animal welfare, biodiversity, and the migration of workers.Barbara Unm√º√üig, Introduction, Meat Atlas , 2014, p. 6. Meat Atlas was first published in German in 2013, and in German and English in 2014, both under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 3.0). The executive editors are Christine Chemnitz of the Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation and Stanka Becheva of Friends of the Earth Europe.Meat Atlas, 2014, back cover. Synopsis=Overview= Magda Stoczkiewicz, director of Friends of the Earth Europe, argues in the report that \\"[n]othing epitomizes what is wrong with our food and farming more than the livestock sector and the quest for cheap and plentiful meat.\\" She writes that livestock farming is one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters, and is responsible for health pandemics and the use of a significant percentage of the world's grain and water. According to the report, based on figures from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, the production of 1 kg (2.2 lb) of beef requires 15,455 litres of water (32,662 pints, or 110 bathtubs), cheese 5,000 litres, rice 3,400 litres and carrots 131 litres. Over 75 kg (165 lb) of meat is consumed in the United States per person per year, 60 kg in Germany, 38 kg in China, and under 20 kg in Africa. The report states that animals are kept in cramped conditions, in artificial light, and fed antibiotics and hormones to ward off disease and speed up growth cheaply. Pigs can reach their market weight with 10‚Äì15 percent less food if they are kept on antibiotics, but overuse has created antibiotic-resistant bacteria, so-called \\"superbugs.\\" Stoczkiewicz argues instead in favour of sustainable farming, where animals are kept in much smaller numbers and are allowed to graze freely, with farmers growing their own crops to feed them.Meat Atlas, 2014, p. 7. =Meat production= World's largest meat producers European sales of antimicrobial agents for food-producing animals, 2011 Through mergers and acquisitions across borders and species, meat production is handled by an ever-diminishing number of large companies.Meat Atlas, 2014, p. 12. The report lists the world's top-ten meat producers (see right), calculated by total food sales in the years 2011‚Äì2013. JBS, headquartered in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, heads the list. The company's 2012 revenue of $38.7 billion exceeded the gross domestic product of Barbados, Iceland, Mauritius and Zimbabwe combined.Mona Chalabi, \\"Meat atlas shows Latin America has become a soybean empire\\", The Guardian, 9 January 2014. JBS is followed by Tyson Foods, Cargill, BRF, Vion, Nippon Meat Packers, Smithfield Foods, Marfrig, and Danish Crown. Just ten companies kill 88 percent of pigs.Meat Atlas, 2014, pp. 13‚Äì14. Because profit margins are tight, companies aim for greater efficiency and lower costs, with as much profit as possible from \\"field to fork.\\"Meat Atlas, 2014, pp. 12, 14. According to the report, JBS can accommodate a daily slaughter of 12 million birds, 85,000 head of cattle and 70,000 pigs, the produce of which is sold in 150 countries.Meat Atlas , 2014, p. 12: \\"These figures give us an idea of what JBS's size means on the ground or at the slaughterhouse: its worldwide capacities can slaughter 85,000 head of cattle, 70,000 pigs, and 12 million birds. Every day.

For the animals it means increased cruelty because of long journeys to slaughterhouses, inadequate stunning, and violence from stressed workers. For the workers, it means low wages, a noisy and highly stressful working environment, and long shifts spent making high-speed repetitive movements with dangerous equipment and frightened animals.

The technology to clone hair is in its early stages. Experts previously assumed that in the case of complete baldness, follicles are completely absent from the scalp, so they cannot be regenerated. However it was discovered that the follicles are not entirely absent, as there are stem cells in the bald scalp from which the follicles naturally arise. Abnormal behavior of these follicles is suggested to be the result of progenitor cell deficiency in these areas. The basic idea of hair cloning is that healthy follicle cells or dermal papillae can be extracted from the subject from areas that are not bald and are not suffering hair loss, they can be multiplied (cloned) by various culturing methods and the newly produced cells can be injected back in the bald scalp, where they would act healthy and produce hair. In 2015, initial trials for human hair were successful in generating new follicles, but the hairs grew in various different directions giving an unnatural look. As of 2019, scientists believe they may have solved this problem by using nearly microscopic 3D printed shafts to assist follicles growing upward through the scalp. This technique however is still in research phase and is not available for public or commercial use. Research=Intercytex= One of the first companies to begin experiment with hair cloning was Intercytex. Researchers at the company were convinced that their approach was the cure for baldness, and if the technology is fully developed, they can basically eliminate hair loss due to hereditary factors. This therapy would also eliminate the need for donor hair, as it can be simply grown from the patient's own cells. Intercytex tried to clone new hair follicles from the stem cells harvested from the back of the neck. They hoped that if they multiplied (cloned) the follicles and then implanted them back in the scalp in the bald areas they would be successful in regrowing the hair itself. They tested the method in their Phase II trials, which showed very promising results as two-thirds of the bald male patients were able to grow new hair after the treatment. The company was hoping to complete the research so they can make it available to the public, so they began Phase III trials. They estimated they would be able to finish the process in a few years. However, these tests did not show the expected progress. In 2008 Intercytex admitted that they failed in fully developing the hair cloning therapy and decided to discontinue all research. This was not solely the result of the failed tests, as the company's financial background also became unstable in 2008 and they had to implement several cost-cutting measures. They laid off a great number of staff members and cut funding to the research projects such as hair cloning. In 2010 they went out of business. =Aderans Research Institute= Another firm researching hair cloning was ARI (Aderans Research Institute), a Japanese company which operated in the US and was the greatest competitor of Intercytex in developing the therapy. The company worked on what they called the \\"Ji Gami\\" process, which involved the removal of a small strip of the scalp, which is broken down into individual follicular stem cells. After the extraction these cells are cultured, multiplied and injected back into the bald areas of the scalp. Scientists hoped that after implantation these cloned follicular cells would mature into full grown hair. During Phase II trials they found that the process was not suitable for multiplication but instead it revitalized the follicles and successfully prevented future loss. The trials continued in 2012. Aderans decided to discontinue the funding of its hair multiplication research in July 2013. =Berlin Technical University= The first time scientists were able to grow artificial hair follicles from stem cells was in 2010. Scientists of the Berlin Technical University in Germany took animal cells and created the follicles by using them. As a result, they produced follicles \\"thinner than normal\\", but they were confident they could develop the right method of cloning hair from human stem cells by 2011. They estimated that the therapy would be publicly available by 2015 as they were already preparing for the clinical trials. Scientists working on the project said if the treatment was finished, it would mean a cure for approximately 80 percent of those who suffer from hair loss. The university was working together with Intercytex and several other research teams, but they encountered several problems. One of them was that the multiplication process was not efficient enough. They were only able to clone one or two follicles from an extracted hair but for the process to be efficient this number should have been around 1000. There was no indication that researchers were able to overcome this obstacle. =University of Pennsylvania= In 2011 scientists from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine published their own findings regarding hair cloning. During their investigation they found that non-bald and bald scalps have the same number of stem cells, but progenitor cell number was significantly depleted in the case of the latter. Based on this, they concluded that it is not the absence of the stem cells that is responsible for the hair loss but the unsuccessful activation of said cells. The researchers continued their investigation and are looking for a way to convert regular stem cells into progenitor cells, which could mean they may be able to activate the natural generation of hair on a previously bald scalp. =Durham University= In late 2013, new results were published by a research team at the Durham University which suggested progress. The scientists tried a new method for multiplying, cloning the original cells not in a 2D but in a 3D system. A team took healthy dermal papillae from hair transplants and dissected them, then cultured them in a petri dish. In 30 hours they were able to produce 3000 dermal papilla cells. The goal was to create dermal papillae that when injected would reprogram cells around it to produce healthy hair. They chose to try the method by injecting the cloned cells in foreskin samples to \\"challenge\\" the cells, as the cells in foreskin normally don't grow hair. The human skin samples were grafted on rats. After six weeks the cloned papillae cells formed brand new hair follicles which were able to grow hair. These are early results and as it is a new approach to hair cloning, several more studies and tests have to be conducted before they can move on to human testing. They also encountered new problems, such as that some of the newly grown hair appeared without pigmentation. =RepliCel Life Sciences= Vancouver-based firm, RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. has been researching the replacing of hormone- compromised hair-follicle cells. In 2013, RepliCel created a partnership with cosmetics company Shiseido, giving Shiseido an exclusive license to use its RCH-01 technology in Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan and the ASEAN countries. Shiseido is currently trialing RepliCel's RCH-01 in Japan for market approval by the end of 2018. RepliCel is planning RCH-01 phase II trials estimated to take place in 2018‚Äì2020. = Riken Centre for Developmental Biology = In 2016, scientists in Japan announced they had successfully grown human skin in a lab. The skin was created using induced pluripotent stem cells, and when implanted in a mouse, the skin grew hairs successfully. Clinical results are expected to come out around 2019. = Stemson Therapeutics = In July 2019, a researcher from San Diego-based Stemson Therapeutics, partnered with UCSD, successfully grew his own follicles on a mouse using iPSC-derived epithelial and dermal cell therapy. The hair grew straight and was aligned properly with a 3D printed biodegradable shaft. The hairs were permanent and regenerated naturally. The company is expecting to begin trials in 2020.

Notable people associated with the club include British Olympic gold medallists Matthew Pinsent and Andrew Triggs Hodge and silver medallist Colin Smith. History In 1868 the University established a society for non-Collegiate students, members of which in 1874 founded St. Catharine's Club; from this sprang St. Catharine's Boat Club (SCBC) in 1875. In 1919 the Boat Club changed the spelling to St. Catherine, and the precursor to the college became St. Catherine's Society. The Boat Club thus has the distinction of having given its name to both the old Society and the modern College, after which it became the SCCBC. =Results= In Oxford, SCCBC first took part in Torpids and Summer Eights in 1876, and produced the first crew to make 7 bumps in the then 6 days of Eights. Fortunes have fluctuated over the years; highlights include 3 crews each making 6 bumps in Eights (1949), and the Women's 1st VIII achieving headship in Torpids in 2007. In Torpids 2012, the men's first boat was fourth on the river and then were bumped three times, ending seventh. The first boat was then ninth on the river after being bumped in the Summer Eight's. In Torpids 2017, the men's first boat bumped three times to end fourth on the river. Following this, in Eights 2017, both the men's first and second boats won blades, finishing 10th in Division 1 and 3rd in Division 4 respectively. Notable members The club achieved its first Blue in 1967 and first women Blues in 1976. Crews have participated in numerous regattas on the Thames and elsewhere, starting with an entry for the Wyfold Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 1883. International representation began with the Commonwealth Games in 1958, and since 1986 SCCBC men and women have regularly filled places in national crews. Matthew Pinsent was the first Olympic Gold associated with the club, winning at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Since then, British Olympic gold medallist Andrew Triggs Hodge, and silver medallist Colin Smith have all rowed for the college.

It is the town's only cemetery, and was established in 1852, not long after the town's incorporation. About of the cemetery's have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its historic portion is a representative of the rural cemetery movement that was popular in the 19th century, with meandering lanes and natural landscaping. Layout and history For organizational purposes the town has divided the cemetery into four districts, lettered A through D, which were roughly developed in chronological order and are laid out from west to east. In the oldest part, Section A, parcels are large family plots that front on either one of the main circulating roads, or smaller roadways that run between them. The oldest stone in this section dates to 1844, likely representing the movement of the burial to this cemetery at a later date. The most notable plots in this section are two military sites, one established by the Grand Army of the Republic for the burials of veterans of the American Civil War and the War of 1812, and one established by the American Legion for World War I veterans. Section B, located north and east of Section A, was developed between 1880 and the 1910s. It contains more varied terrain than the older section, and its rocky terrain made placement of graves more difficult. Its notable elements include a series of hillside tombs, including a receiving tomb designed by Lynn architect Henry Warren Rogers and completed in 1924. The area also marks a stylistic transition from family plots, which predominate in Section A, to individual plots. This section is also the location of the cemetery's most prominent feature, the Andrews Chapel. This Late Gothic building was designed by Charles Vernon Burgess and completed in 1924. Its construction was funded by Ellen T. Andrews in memorial for her late husband Isaac. Section C was developed in the 1920s on land acquired from an adjacent estate to the east of Andrews Chapel. Its terrain is even rockier than that of Section B, and there are significant sections that are impossible to use for burial purposes. Its centerpiece is a Veterans Lot, laid out to provide burial space for World War II and later veterans. The most prominent site in this section is the cemetery's only above-ground private crypt, that of C. F. Knowlton. The last portion of the cemetery to be developed was Section D, beginning in the 1960s. Unlike earlier sections, it features a more regular rectangular layout of roadways, paths, and burial sites. The three oldest sections of the cemetery, totalling about 20 acres, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Section D was excluded from this listing because it was developed after 1963, and is organized in a more uniform way than the older portions. After decades of disrepair, the Andrews Chapel underwent significant restoration beginning in 2010. The Massachusetts Historical Commission awarded the 2017 Historic Preservation Award for the project.

He is known for his indictments against Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. Early years Pierre Ernest Pinard was born in Autun, Sa√¥ne-et- Loire, on 10 October 1822. His father, who belonged to the judiciary, died in 1830, leaving a widow and three children. Ernest was the eldest. He was a brilliant and very pious student at the Petit-S√©minaire of Autun. He went on to the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris. He studied law in Paris and became an advocate. Pinard decided to join the judiciary, and on 1 May 1849 was named deputy prosecutor at Tonnerre. On 12 December 1851 he became deputy prosecutor at Troyes, and then on 30 December 1852 at Reims. On 30 October 1853 he was appointed deputy prosecutor at the Tribunal of the Seine in Paris, where he showed his remarkable talent as an orator. In January 1857 Pinard prosecuted Gustave Flaubert for \\"offense to public and religious morality and to good morals\\" for his 1856 novel Madame Bovary, which deals with adultery. He said that \\"Art that observes no rule is no longer art; it is like a woman who disrobes completely. To impose the one rule of public decency on art is not to subjugate it but to honor it\\". Pinard failed to win a conviction, although Flaubert was reprimanded by the court. In August 1857 Pinard prosecuted Charles Baudelaire for his 1857 collection of poems, Les Fleurs du Mal. Seven of the poems were banned due to their lesbian or sadomasochistic themes, a ban that technically remained in place until 1948. In April 1859 Pinard was named deputy prosecutor at the imperial court, and on 3 October 1861 he was promoted to the grade of advocate-general, and appointed procureur general in Douai. Minister of the Interior Pinard in 1867 by Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon Pinard was appointed to the Conseil d'Etat (Council of State) in 1866, aged 44, seen as one of the new men who could rejuvenate the empire. He was appointed Minister of the Interior on 13 November 1867, replacing Charles de La Valette. Pinard was not well liked by Eug√®ne Rouher, the principal minister of the regime. Although attached to the Catholic Church, Pinard saw that the empire needed to become more liberal. He was in favor of a broad union between ultramontane Catholics who disagreed with imperial policy towards Rome and Bonapartists who supported reform, a combination that was opposed by Rouher. Pinard drafted a new press law in which prison sentences were replaced by fines, and pushed it through against opposition from Rouher. However, Pinard remained authoritarian in temperament. He demanded firm action in a case against the journal La Lanterne. He made a clumsy attempt to use force to suppress a demonstration commemorating the death of Jean-Baptiste Baudin, which destroyed his authority. Pinard left office on 17 December 1868. Later career Pinard would not accept a Senate seat. In 1869 he was elected deputy for the 7th circonscription of the Nord department. He was one of the small minority that protested the deposition of the emperor Napoleon III after the French lost the Battle of Sedan. He was imprisoned in 1871 for his Bonapartist activities. Pinard returned to the bar of Paris. In 1876 he ran unsuccessfully for election as a deputy. He died on 12 September 1909 in Bourg-en-Bresse, Ain, aged 86.

They are intertidal in preference, and tend to form crowded columnar colonies. They can be identified in the field by having a four-plated wall, an unfused rostrum, and narrow opercular plates. Elminius, which also inhabits the same area, has four plates in its shell wall. However, in Elminius, the rostrum and rostrolatera are fused completely, and the compound rostrum receives the alae of the adjacent carinolaterals. In Chamaesipho, the unfused rostrum bears alae, and closely resembles the carina in appearance. Definition and Discussion The primary shell wall is four plated, reduced from six by fusion of rostrolatera and carinolatera during ontogeny. No sutural interfolding is observed. With age, all plate sutures become concrescent. The basis is membraneous. Opercular plates are deeply articulated, but do not fuse together. The scutum bears a visible lateral depressor pit, and a scutal adductor ridge which ranges from nearly absent/indistinct to rounded prominent. The Tergum is pitted internally. There is no trace of a tergal spur, and the tergal depressor area is wide, with prominent crests.ingentaconnect In soft part morphology, caudal appendages are absent.

Normally, exposed, higher littoral zones are preferred. No verifiable records of Chamaesipho are known outside of Australia and New Zealand. Darwin, 1854, described Chamaesipho scutelliformis, a living species from South China Sea, with considerable reservations as to generic assignment.472 Foster, in 1982, proposed the genus Chinochthamalus to receive this highly unusual form. In his original description of Chamaesipho columna, Spengler appears to have used abnormally large shells listed as from Otaheite (Tahiti). In Foster and Anderson, 1986, these shells are considered to be likely Epopella, from New Zealand, and mislabeled. The only previously known fossil record was a Miocene occurrence from New Zealand ascribed questionably to Chamaesipho brunnea. No opercular plates were present in this material, thus exact species placement cannot be determined. Chamaesipho grebneffi from the late Oligocene of New Zealand was recently described by Buckeridge, et al., with opercular plates present. The four completely fused shell plates show that Chamaesipho was fully derived on generic level in Paleogene times.

History The Army of the Evros was formed following the defeat and evacuation of the Army of Asia Minor from Anatolia in August 1922. Hostilities between Greece and Turkey ceased with the Armistice of Mudanya, but the Armistice obliged the Greek army to evacuate Eastern Thrace (awarded to Greece with the Treaty of S√®vres in 1920) and withdraw behind the Evros river. Negotiations for a final peace treaty began between Greece, Turkey and the Allied Powers in Lausanne, but the resumption of warfare in a new Greco-Turkish war remained a possibility as irreconcilable differences separated the Greek and Turkish positions, especially in the matter of war reparations demanded by the Turkish delegation. The revolutionary military government that had seized control of Greece in September 1922 immediately set about reorganizing the remnants of the Army of Asia Minor as the \\"Army of the Evros\\". This task was undertaken by the capable Lt. General Theodoros Pangalos, who quickly managed to restore order and discipline in the army and form a capable fighting force comprising the II, III and IV Corps. Plans were even prepared for the crossing of the Evros and the recapture of Eastern Thrace, where the local Turkish forces were considerably outclassed. In the event, the signature of the Treaty of Lausanne on 24 July 1923 pre-empted the resumption of war, and the Army of the Evros was disbanded soon after. The decision was vehemently opposed by Pangalos, who likened Lausanne to another \\"Treaty of Antalcidas\\".

In 1972, she quit her job selling computer time-sharing for General Electric and devoted more of her time to starting a family. She founded ASK Group as a part-time job, using $2,000 of her own savings. Kurtzig wasn't able to give up working completely and launched a small, part-time contract software-programming business out of her second bedroom \\"to keep her mind occupied\\" and increase her income, never intending the business to operate outside her house. She was asked to create an inventory-tracking program that could efficiently provide manufacturing information by her first client. Realizing that other manufacturers might find such a program useful, she recruited several graduates with degrees in engineering and computers. They wrote standardized applications that addressed problems faced by local manufacturers under her direction. Kurtzig reinvested all profits into growing the company. Her company required access to minicomputers and she persuaded employees at a nearby Hewlett-Packard plant to allow her company to use one of the company's HP 3000 minicomputers outside of normal working hours. By 1978, ASK released a package of programs called Manman, one of the first enterprise resource planning (ERP) software suites. She later concluded a deal for Hewlett Packard to sell Manman for use on HP3000 minicomputers, at a time when most ERP software was only available to run on more expensive mainframe computers. The company went public on NASDAQ in 1981, and in 1983, Kurtzig's personal stake in the ASK Group was worth $67 million. She resigned from her role of CEO of the ASK Group in 1985. but returned in 1989 to refocus and once again grow the company. ASK bought Ingres Corporation in November 1990. At its peak, the company's annual sales were just under $1 billion U.S. dollars. In 2010 she founded the enterprise management software company Kenandy, where she served as the CEO through 2015 and is currently the Chairman. Kenandy specializes in producing cloud ERP solutions for manufacturing businesses.

Routine hygiene is generally not sufficient to eliminate the parasite, hence its Latin name, meaning \\"tenacious\\". The parasite is frequently encountered in periodontal infections, affecting more than 50% of the population in some areas, but it is usually considered insignificant. T. tenax is generally not found on the gums of healthy patients. It is known to play a pathogenic role in necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis, worsening preexisting periodontal disease. This parasite is also implicated in some chronic lung diseases; in such cases, removal of the parasite is sufficient to allow recovery (Mussaev 1976).  Morphology  thumbnail Of the three species in the genus Trichomonas, T. tenax is the smallest, measuring only 5-14 ¬µm long and 6-9 ¬µm wide; specimens can be identified by their long axostyles and tails, 4 anterior flagella, and by the recurrent flagellum that raises an undulating membrane which is two thirds the length of the body. This undulating membrane may appear like small legs. It may occasionally appear larger, allowing it to be confused with Trichomonas vaginalis due to similar morphology. In such cases, the presence of an oral or vaginal parasite should be confirmed, due to the ease with which the parasite can be transmitted through direct contact of mucous membranes.  Life cycle  T. tenax trophozoites survive in the body as mouth scavengers that feed primarily on local microorganisms located between the teeth, tonsillar crypts, pyorrheal pockets, and the gingival margin around the gums. T. tenax trophozoites multiply by longitudinal binary fission. These trophozoites are unable to survive the digestive process.  Clinical = Transmission = T. tenax is a commensal of the human oral cavity, found particularly in the patients with poor oral hygiene and advanced periodontal disease. Transmission is through saliva, droplet spray, and kissing or use of contaminated dishes or drinking water. = Signs and symptoms = T. tenax alone is not known to cause any symptoms. There are merely implications that this parasite may worsen preexisting periodontal disease and in rare cases has been reported to cause bronchopulmonary infections, mainly in patients with underlying cancers or other lung diseases. The organism is believed to enter the respiratory tract by aspiration from the oropharynx. = Mechanism = In infected hosts, the parasite can typically be found among dental calculus, as well as within the tonsillar crypts, which will often become purulent during the course of infection. T. tenax may also be involved in the degradation of periodontal tissue through the secretion of substances such as alkaline phosphatases and the fibronectin cathepsine. T. tenax is classified as a parasite due to the manner in which it causes damage to host tissues; its behavior when in contact with target cells is similar to the closely related and likewise parasitic T. vaginalis. It has no cysts and is only transmitted directly in its vegetative form. = Diagnosis = The specimen of choice for diagnosing Trichomonas tenax trophozoite is mouth scrapings. Microscopic examination of tonsillar crypts and pyorrheal pockets of patients suffering from T. tenax infections often yields the typical trophozoites. Tartar between the teeth and the gingival margin of the gums are the primary areas of the mouth that may also potentially harbor this organism. T. tenax may also be cultured onto appropriate media. = Treatment = Regardless of patient‚Äôs demographic characteristics, it seems that oral hygiene instructions in combination with scaling and root planning can help with controlling excessive colonization of parasites, particularly E. gingivalis and T. tenax and their probable opportunistic infestation. T. tenax can easily be detected through the use of phase-contrast microscopy. Biofilm harvested from infested areas of the periodontal pockets can be mounted onto a slide; T. tenax, if present, will be clearly visible. The preparation must use the patient's saliva as the medium, as the use of plain water or saline as hypotonic solutions could cause the cells to lyse.  History  The etymology of the name Trichomonas tenax is from a combination of Greek: (tiny hair) + (simple creature), and Latin: (to keep, to stick to). During the early 1900s, prisoners at the San Quentin prison in California were subject to advanced periodontal disease at a rate of almost 90%, owing at least in part to a high rate of infection by T. tenax. In the Journal of the American Dental Association, it was speculated that this high rate of transmission was attributable to the crowding and poor diets faced by inmates. Age was also an important factor in this population and intense inflammation was observed.  Research directions  Owing to the morphological similarity between T. tenax and other trichomonad spp., examination of a greater number of organisms is necessary to establish a reliable diagnosis than is easily obtained from the patient's mouth. Iin vitro, T. tenax reproduced better in LES medium, pH value between 5.80 and 7.00 with cultivation temperature of 35 ¬∞C than other media with pH 5.40 and cultivation temperature of 37 ¬∞C. Normal, healthy human saliva is slightly alkaline at pH 7.40. Whitening products have a mean pH of 8.22 with a range (5.09-11.13). Whitening toothpastes have a mean pH of 6.83 with a range (4.22-8.35). Mouthwashes also vary greatly in pH from pH 4.40 to 6.80. Mouth rinsing after an acidic challenge increased salivary pH. The tested mouthwashes raised pH higher than water. Mouthwashes with a neutralizing effect can potentially reduce tooth erosion from acid exposure. Essentially the human mouth is an optimum habitat for this organism and any pH level alteration needed to stunt the reproductive rate significantly would require a duration of time that would cause greater damage to the tooth enamel than to T. tenax. Regular oral hygiene and dental visits to remove dental plaque is currently the best solution to deal with this protozoan. Other hosts T. tenax has been found in the mouths of a small proportion of dogs, cats and horses, but other animals are expected to have their own species of Trichomonas .

After the interim judgement by the supreme court on Padmanabhaswami Temple case, Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma remain the trustee of the temple and does the ritual duties as the Maharajah Of Travancore (Titular) but currently has no administrative power regarding the temple management. The Supreme court bench comprising justice R. M. Lodha and justice A. K. Patnaik ordered a temporary change in administration by forming a 5-member committee and appointing Vinod Rai as auditor. The committee will include Thiruvananthapuram District Sub Judge K.P. Indira, Thantri and Nambi of the temple and two members to be decided in consultation with the Government of Kerala and the Travancore Royal Family. Additionally one Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer and a former administrator of the temple were appointed as executive officers.  Early life  Rama Varma is the youngest son of H.H. Maharani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore and her husband, Prince Consort Lt. Col. G. V. Raja, and was born on 12 June 1949 in Thiru-Kochi. His siblings are the late Crown Prince (Elayarajah) Sree Padmanabhadasa Sree Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma (died at the age of 6 due to rheumatic heart disease, long before he was born), Princess Pooyam Thirunal Gowri Parvathi Bayi and the writer, Princess Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi. Like his father, Lt. Col. G. V. Raja, Rama Varma is also an avid sports and book lover. He was educated privately by selected tutors in various subjects. He later graduated from Mar Evanios College, Thiruvananthapuram, with Physics as his selective subject. Then he moved to Kolkata and worked there for some years. He then went to England to learn business management and worked there for a year.  Later life and marriage  After finishing his higher education and working in England, Rama Varma returned to India in 1972 and, at his uncles' advise, joined the spice trading company Aspinwall Ltd in Mangalore. Rama Varma then married Rema Varma in 1976. They were divorced in 2002. In the same year, he married Ammachi Panapillai Amma Srimathi Girija Thankachi of Vazhuthacadu, alias Dr. Girija Rama Varma, former radiologist based in London. After their 2002 wedding the couple lived in Mangalore till 2013. After Rama Varma assumed the Titular Maharajah's position (due to his maternal uncle's death), they moved to Kowdiar, Trivandrum, and settled down there. Rama Varma served as a consultant and in various executive positions like, Additional Director (2004‚Äì2005), Director of Planning (2005‚Äì2007), Executive Director Aspinwall & Co Travancore Ltd (since 2005), Member of Aspinwall Promoter Group (since 2005), Managing Director of Aspinwall and Co Ltd in Mangalore (since 2008).

And when Sree Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma died on 16 December 2013, he became the Titular Maharajah Of Travancore. He was appointed after a function called Thirumudikalasam, as the head of the Travancore Royal Family on 3 January 2014, was held at Kalasamandapam near the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. After rituals and traditional procedures, Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboodiripad, the temple Tantri (high priest), poured 'punyajalam' (holy water) over Rama Varma, making him the new head of the royal family. The anoinment function was a very private affair and only the closest family members and priests took part in it. Rama Varma, as of now, is also the Supreme Guardian or Custodian of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Thiruvananthapuram. After his installation, he arrived at the Kulasekhara Mandapam of the temple where the Ettara Yogam presided over by the Pushpanjali Swamiyar held a meeting. The Yogam recognised Rama Varma as Chirava Mooppan and Thrippappoor Mooppan, and the Swamiyar signed on the neettu.

He was raised as a Roman Catholic. He was educated at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, the University of Vienna and the University of Cologne, where he received a PhD in Art History. =Career= He started his career as a painter in Paris, France, where he became associated with the School of Paris in the 1930s. He also associated himself with the existentialist philosopher Paul Tillich (1886‚Äì1965), and he became interested in the psychoanalytic findings of Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) and the expressionist music of Arnold Schoenberg (1874‚Äì1951). In 1936, he had his first solo exhibition at the Wildenstein Institute in Paris. He served with the French army during the Second World War. He was critical of the Nazis on French radio and drew disparaging caricatures of their leadership. When they invaded France, he moved to the South of France, where he joined the French resistance. During that time, he received stipends from the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom and from Quakers. Marie Norton Harriman, wife of W. Averell Harriman (1891-1986) and director of the Marie Harriman Gallery in New York City, helped him and his wife be evacuated from France. Thanks to her help, the couple arrived in New York City in 1942. Once in New York, he was patronised by Baroness Hilla von Rebay (1890-1967), also a painter and the mistress of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861-1949). He taught at Fordham University, Parsons The New School for Design and The New School for Social Research. Meanwhile, he also exhibited his paintings at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Wehe Gallery. He also exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. From 1954 to 1956, he lived in Caracas, Venezuela, where his sister lived, and he exhibited his paintings in the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo. He moved back to the US and served as the Director of the French-American Art Institute in Washington, D.C. from 1956 to 1959. That year, after his wife died, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee and joined the Department of Fine Arts in the College of Arts and Science at Vanderbilt University as a faculty member and taught drawing and painting. However, he clashed with other faculty members, including the department chair, Walter Sharp, and the Chancellor, Harvie Branscomb (1894-1998). He also sided with Gordon D. Kaufman (1925-2011), who was teaching at the Vanderbilt University Divinity School, to support African-American activist James Lawson, who was expelled from the Vanderbilt campus in 1960. Meanwhile, he continued to produce paintings, and exhibited at the Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art, the Parthenon and the Vanderbilt Art Gallery. However, he was fired by Vanderbilt University in 1963, though he stayed in his one-bedroom apartment close to campus overlooking the Centennial Park until he died six years later. Paul Harmon, another painter from Nashville, inherited the executorship of his estate. Some of his paintings are exhibited in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C..Smithsonian American Art Museum: Search Collection Others can be found in the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris, the National Gallery in Berlin, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and the Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art in Nashville. =Personal life= He was married to Herthe Marie.

It was conceived by programmer and writer John Graham-Cumming to address questions around what the source code seen in films actually does. Graham-Cumming was inspired to create the blog by Neill Blomkamp's 2013 film Elysium, which uses an extract from an Intel manual. He posted a comparison image related to the film on Twitter, which prompted more than 500 retweets. He then created the blog.

It commemorates the life of John Laird, a local ship builder, politician and benefactor. The statue was sculpted by Albert Bruce-Joy, and unveiled in 1877 by Lord Tollemache. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History John Laird (1805‚Äì74) was a shipbuilder and politician. He was born in Greenock, Scotland, and as a child moved with his family to Liverpool, then in 1824 to Birkenhead, where his father, William, founded a shipbuilding business. John was educated at Liverpool Royal Institution and, after training as a solicitor, joined his father's business in 1828. When William Laird retired in 1839, John became sole partner. He retired in 1861, and the business was continued by his three sons, eventually becoming the major ship building firm of Cammell Laird. During the time that John Laird was working in the company it pioneered the use of iron-cladding of ships, and of steam propulsion for ships. When Laird retired from the business he became the first Member of Parliament for Birkenhead. He was also Chairman of the Birkenhead Improvement Commission, and a member of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, where he played a major part in the completion of Birkenhead Docks. In addition Laird was a benefactor, helping to provide hospitals, churches and colleges in the town. Following his death in 1874 a public meeting was organised, and it was agreed that a statue should be erected, paid for by public subscription. More than the ¬£2,500 needed for the statue was raised, the remainder being used for social purposes in the town. A competition for the design of the statue was arranged, and the first prize of ¬£150 was won by Albert Bruce-Joy, a young Irish sculptor. The statue was made at the foundry of Robert Masefield and Company in Chelsea. It was unveiled on 31 October 1877 by Lord Tollemache, the occasion being witnessed by between 12,000 and 15,000 people. Originally it stood on the east side of Hamilton Square facing Birkenhead Town Hall, but was moved to the west side of the square in 1925 when the Birkenhead War Memorial was erected. Description John Laird in 1861 The figure of John Laird is in bronze, and this stands on a pedestal in granite and stone. The figure is about high and the pedestal is about in height. Laird is depicted standing, as if speaking to a meeting, dressed in contemporary dress, including a buttoned coat and a loose overcoat. In his right hand he is holding plans for Birkenhead Docks. On the base of the statue are inscribed the details of the sculptor and the founders. The inscription the pedestal reads as follows. Appraisal The statue was designated as a Grade II listed building on 28 March 1974. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\". In March 1877, when the figure of Laird was reaching completion, the Belfast News-Letter praised the fact that he was \\"represented in the ordinary dress of an English gentlemen\\", rather than \\"the senseless costume of the toga\\", which was fashionable in statues at the time.

It is about a teen and his best friend who become involved in a plot to murder an old woman, to collect her life insurance as a means to escape their troubled family lives. Overview Buffalo Boys is the first feature film from director Ray Guarnieri, and has won several awards at film festivals in the northeast including ‚ÄúBest Coming of Age Film‚Äù at the 2013 Manhattan Film Festival, as well as ‚ÄúBest Crime Drama‚Äù at the 2013 International Indie Gathering Film Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. The film centers on two teenage boys and their troubled family lives in the suburbs of Buffalo, NY. Their anger toward their family problems causes self- destructiveness as the boys sell drugs to their friends and eventually become involved in a plot to murder the grandmother of their dealer, Maxine, so that they can collect her life insurance money and escape to a better life. Plot Inspired by a true story, Buffalo Boys follows the life of Ian, 15 (Paul Castro Jr.). After discovering the man who raised him is not his biological father, Ian's world is forever changed, as he becomes embroiled in a plot to murder an elderly woman. His mother, Mary-Ann (Mckenzie Trent), refuses to name his real father, fueling Ian's desire to escape suburbia. His girlfriend, Lindsay (Ilana Mollick), urges him to stay and work things out, while his best friend, Daniel (Ro‚Äô Mack), continues to lead him down a violent path. Together, the boys sell drugs to make money- until their dealer, Maxine (Tilke Hill), offers an easier way to get rich quick- murder her grandmother and collect her life insurance policy. At first, Ian refuses to go along with the plan, but things get worse at home when his mother admits he is the product of a rape when she was in college. Distraught and feeling betrayed Ian again turns to Daniel. The boys finally relent to Maxine's persistence and agree to commit the murder. Ian, who is to drive the getaway car, has a change of heart at the last minute, but when he runs into the house- it's too late. They are caught the very next day, and Ian is sentenced to two years in juvenile penitentiary at Ft. Tryon. Two years later, Ian returns home and attempts to put the pieces of his life back together. His friends shun him at first, but eventually warm up to him when they see that he's changed. Just as everything is getting back to normal, Ian and Lindsay attend a Halloween rave party, where a miscommunication between the DJ and Ian causes a fight and in the mix, Ian is stabbed to death. Cast * Paul Castro Jr., as Ian * Ro‚Äô Mack, as Daniel * Mckenzie Trent, as Mary-Ann * Ilana Mollick, as Lindsay * Matt Tester, as Chef * Tilke Hill, as Maxine Themes Buffalo Boys is a film that shows that the consequences of one‚Äôs actions can be much more far reaching than one ever would expect. It is a film about coming of age and the need to learn to live and love with family- no matter how complicated an individual‚Äôs situation is. Production In 2009, after the murder of the childhood friend from whose life \\"Buffalo Boys\\" is inspired, Director Raymond Guarnieri began revisiting experiences and writing the screenplay. Early in the process, fellow producer Mckenzie Trent and writer Elana Lott joined him and together they completed the screenplay over a 9-month period. From the outset, The Better StirFry Team, consisting of Matt Tester, Jason Montalvo, Guarnieri and Trent, insisted on shooting the movie on-location in Western New York, both for the sake of authenticity and because of the richness of the region in resources. In July 2012, the \\"Buffalo Boys\\" project was pre-approved for the NYS Tax Incentive for Filmmakers, making it the smallest-budget film ever to pass the high standards of the program. The \\"Better\\" Team completed production of the film in 23 days in August 2012. Post-Production began immediately until the film was completed in late February 2013. The film was completed in March 2013 and premiered at the 2013 Manhattan Film Festival where it took home ‚ÄúBest Coming of Age Film.‚Äù Since its premiere, the film has sold-out five screenings at various festivals including the 2013 Buffalo International Film Festival and the 2013 Indie Gathering International Film Festival.

Design and development From about 1950 to his death in February 1981, Iosif »òilimon was Romania's most prominent glider designer, his aircraft distinguished by his initials. The IS-4 first flew on 5 June 1959. It was a high wing cantilever monoplane with an all wood structure and was largely plywood skinned. The wings, mounted with 2.5¬∞ of dihedral, were double straight tapered, with a little more taper outboard and an almost unswept leading edge. They were built around a single spar with a forward torsion box between it and the leading edge. The tips carried the small sreamlined bodies known as salmons, common at the time. Ply and fabric covered ailerons ran from the tips over the more tapered outboard panels, with mid-chord spoilers immediately inboard, opening above and below the wing. The fuselage was a plywood monocoque, tapering to the tail. A single piece, side hinged, moulded perspex canopy enclosed the single seat cockpit from the nose to the leading edge, with an additional small roof transparency aft of the leading edge. The empennage was conventional, with a straight tapered tailplane mounted on a small step above the fuselage, carrying straight edged elevators with gaps at their roots between elevator and fin and at the tips between them and rearward extension of the tailplane tips. The elevators were mass balanced by a weight within the fuselage but not aerodynamically balanced. A narrow fin with a small forward fillet rose above the tailplane to the full height of the rudder, which was broad with a rounded heel, flat tipped and also unbalanced. The rudder extended down to the keel, requiring a cut-out in the aft part of the elevators for its movement. Like the ailerons the horizontal tail was covered with fabric over ply but the fin was simply ply skinned and the rudder fabric covered. The IS-4 had a short, rubber sprung skid reaching from the nose to under about mid-canopy and a fixed, unsprung monowheel under the wing, fitted with a brake. There was also a small tail bumper, protecting the bottom of the rudder. The IS-4 was the first Romanian sailplane designed to meet FAI Standard Class rules.

It is one of the oldest banks in Poland and Europe. It is the 10th largest bank in Poland in terms of assets, and 18th in terms of number of outlets. It is currently operating under the brand name Citi (formerly Citibank) and is owned by Citigroup. Its current headquarters is in the Jab≈Çonowski Palace. History It was founded in 1870 by a group of bourgeoisie financiers, landowners and intelligentsia. The initiator was the financier Leopold Stanis≈Çaw Kronenberg (1812-1878). The first president of the bank was Jozef Zamoyski. By 1872, the bank had branches and offices in St Petersburg, Moscow, Berlin, Gda≈Ñsk (Commerzbank in Warschau), Szczecin and ≈Å√≥d≈∫, and representative offices in W≈Çoc≈Çawek, P≈Çock, Gr√≥jec, Guz√≥w, Lublin and Rawa Mazowiecka. In subsequent years, it opened branches in other cities, including Sosnowiec (1895), Czƒôstochowa (1897) and Kalisz (1898). In the early years of the twentieth century the bank was the largest private bank in Polish lands and one of the few leading financial services to trade with Russia and Western Europe. During this period, the bank's turnover fluctuated at the level of 2 billion rubles, which was greater than the sum of the then budget of the Russian Empire. The bank made a significant contribution to the construction of the railway network and major industrial plants in the Polish Kingdom. In the 1920s and 1930s the bank represented the Polish government's assets in numerous international companies, notably the Danzig Shipyard. The bank did not stop its activities during the two world wars, it only limited activity. During World War II, the bank's branches in the areas annexed by Germany were liquidated, while those in the General Government operated under the strict control of the occupation authorities. Reactivated in 1945, the bank was a private industrial and commercial company and cooperative. As one of the three banks which escaped formal nationalization after the war, it was subjected to controls of a government commissioner and the state took a significant amount of shares. During the People's Republic of Poland it was one of two banks (along with Pekao SA), operating as a joint stock company. After 1945, the bank was the main Polish foreign correspondent bank, and in 1964 it received the official monopoly on Polish foreign trade transactions. This resulted as a consequence of the construction of the then-largest Polish financial institutional network of correspondent banks, opening a branch in London, foreign representative offices in New York City, Moscow, Belgrade, Rome and Berlin, and affiliation in Vienna, Luxembourg and Frankfurt. After 1989, the bank lost a privileged position in foreign trade and began to transform gradually into a commercial bank, opening a number of branches around the country. During the political transformation, the bank (especially a bank branch in Luxembourg) had played a significant role in the scandal of the Foreign Debt Service Fund (Fundusz Obs≈Çugi Zad≈Çu≈ºenia Zagranicznego - FOZZ) Zbigniew Mas≈Çowski, the Director of the Commercial Bank in Luxembourg in the years 1985 - 1990, tried to oppose this practice. A large number of foreign exchange operations conducted by FOZZ were only through the bank. An inspection of the bank by the Supreme Audit Office (Poland), led by Inspector Halina ≈Åadomirska in 1991-1992 revealed numerous irregularities. The report shows that during the period of foreign exchange market control, they were operated to the detriment of the Polish economy with estimated losses during these two years of 5-10 billion dollars, . In 1997, the bank was privatized. The current bank Jab≈Çonowski Palace, main headquarters In 2001 Bank Handlowy merged with Citibank (Poland) SA.

He attended secondary school in Digne and then Lyon. Between 1829 and 1837, he was a journalist in Paris and traveled to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and England between 1834 and 1837. In 1837 he decided that there was no future in journalism, and decided to enter the academic world. In 1838 he published a history of the 16th century and an autobiographical novel. In 1840 he traveled in southern Germany and northern Italy. He earned a PhD in 1841 with a thesis on Aristotle written in Latin. In 1841 Fortoul was appointed professor of literature at the University of Toulouse. He married that year. He published a two-volume work on German Art in 1841-42. In 1845 he was appointed professor of French literature and dean of the faculty of letters at Aix-en-Provence. Political career After the February Revolution of 1848, Fortoul ran for 1848 Constituent Assembly election, but was defeated. He was elected as deputy for Basses-Alpes in the 1849 French legislative election. He steadily moved towards a Bonapartist position. In October 1851 he was appointed Minister of the Navy, and on 3 December 1851 he became Minister of Education and Religious Affairs. He was appointed senator in 1854.

Since 1988 the Autonomous University of Barcelona and the UCL Institute of Archaeology study and record the fossil sequence of southern European Neanderthals who inhabited the area during the Middle Paleolithic approximately 50,000 years ago. The excavation team utilizes a worldwide unique digital system and various innovative technologies, that significantly improve the quality of the classification of the recovered objects. Roca dels Bous has as one of the first Paleolithic excavation sites in Spain established a visitor centre, that focuses on displaying the Prehistory research of the prepyrenees area.  History of the region  The sequence of radiocarbon dates suggests that Neanderthals survived longer in the Iberian Peninsula, where a small group had retreated well after the arrival of modern humans in the rest of Europe. Neanderthal presence after 30,000 BP at archaeological sites in the Western Mediterranean and Portugal has been confirmed. Around 40,000 BP, a new techno- economical ‚Äì and possibly social ‚Äì tradition different from the Neanderthal Mousterin culture had emerged in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. This culture has been associated with anatomically modern humans, who, have arrived in Europe via the Eastern Mediterranean and quickly spread throughout the continent. History of the project The site is located north of the city of Balaguer, Province of Lleida in northeast Spain, above the river Segre at a height of in the Pyrenees foothills. The principal aim of the project is to study the population organisation of the late Middle Paleolithic, the critical factors that drove Neanderthals to extinction and a possible Neanderthal - modern human interaction. In a letter in 1973, Emili Sunyer acknowledges the Mousterian sequence present in the slopes of Pyrenees of Lleida. Excavation probes yielded especially flint and quartzite artifacts typical of Middle Paleolithic Neanderthals. In the excavation sequence, that reached a depth of bones from various animals of different ecosystems that were part of the diet of Neanderthal groups were found. Fossils of woodland (red deer), grasslands (wild horses) and rock dwellers (wild goats) are documented, which implies that Roca dels Bous might have been or have been part of an ecotone. The small number of artifacts and animal remains and the absence of continuous hearth layers suggests, that Roca dels Bous served as a temporary shelter for small groups of hunters, rather than as a permanent settlement. Focus of research has shifted on how much of Neanderthal mobility depended on the migration patterns of their prey.Nicholas J. Conard; J√ºrgen Richter (11 February 2011). Neanderthal Lifeways, Subsistence and Technology: One Hundred Fifty Years of Neanderthal Study. Springer Science & Business Media. pp. 216‚Äì. . However, the site's central location was emphasized in a 2014 publication, as it allows an effective control of the seasonal animal movements, especially equids (horse and wild ass) and deer, bet-ween the Ebro Depression and the Pyrenees.  Research  Research work began in 1988. This wide period of time has contributed to achieve a high level of knowledge about this important moment in the history. Currently the European Union contributed to its development as a museum, together with special infrastructure construction uncommon in other prehistoric sites. La Roca dels Bous forms part of the European project POCTEFA, a partnership between the countries of Spain, France and Andorra. Its aim is to provide highly valuable information about the Neanderthal occupation in this area and reasons that drove them to their sudden disappearance.  ICT and museumization  A digital environment has been designed for the study of Roca dels Bous. The system utilizes spatial and contextual information and intervenes parallel and directly in the recovery and documentation process. Advantages are, for example, exact hypothese creation, which can only be derived based on the excavation data and the detection of faulty interpretation of the archaeological record. Roca dels Bous is the first archaeological site in Spain, that features an interactive museum and exhibition, that are part of the Archaeological Park of Sant Lloren√ß de Montgaian. Visitors can take interactive tours through photos, drawings, videos, maps and 3D applications. Via laser triangulation, the archaeologist can log the exact location of the findings. Otherwise research team use innovative digital system, which allows classifying the pieces found. The incorporation of incorporating Datamatrix codes (DM) to the fieldwork and use of PDA. This novelty reduces the error rate (from 40% to 1%) and the labeling time in a half. This methodology is starting to be adapted to other archaeological projects across Europe.

The current Falcon inn was built in the late 19th century as a purpose-built hotel, with a pub on the ground floor, and is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. It has entered the Guinness World Records for having the longest bar counter in a public house. The history of The Falcon can be traced back to 1733 and it is likely that an inn stood at the site before that time. History The Manor of Battersea was owned from about 1613 to 1763 by the St John baronets, of Lydiard Tregoze, who latterly became the Bolingbroke Viscounts. The supporters of the armorial bearings of the St John family were a falcon wings displayed Or, or, more plainly, a pair of golden falcons displaying their wings. The Falcon inn is thought to have taken its name from this display of heraldry. Undertakers Regaling 1801 etching of a John Nixon caricature of The Falcon, playing on the name of the then landlord, Robert Death. Undertakers revell around the pub as in the background carriages ascending and descending the hill look to be in danger The Survey of London points to the earliest record of The Falcon dating to 1733, but speculates that an inn of that name had by that time long existed. An 1882 publication about Battersea makes the claim that a portion of the Falcon Tavern dates back 275 years. The Falcon site was, from 1717, on the Southwark to Kingston turnpike, at a ford over the Hydeburn brook (itself later renamed the Falcon brook) and at the foot of St Johns Hill and Lavender Hill. Its idyllic position is captured in a circa 1801 caricature by John Nixon, bearing comic verse from 1785 by Edward Trapp Pilgrim; both playing on the name of the then landlord, Robert Death. The inn was extended some time after 1835 and refronted in brick by the then landlord John Alder. In the 1870s and 1880s the area around The Falcon was developed into the terraced- house streetscape which remains to current times. Alfred Heaver, one of the key property developers, with the assistance of the Wandsworth District Board of Works, established St Johns Road as a straight wide road from what had been little more than a farm-track. The Falcon now found itself occupying a key location at the crossroads of St Johns Road and St Johns Hill as both were developed into streets of shops. The then landlord, John Tavener, entered into what appears to have been a land-for-reconstruction swap with another developer, George Nathaniel Street, so that The Falcon was in 1882-3 relocated to the curved crossroads corner of its site and rebuilt in its current form by builders R. & H. Pickersgill. J.F.B., writing in the 1 December 1883 edition of Notes and Queries, mourned the passing of the old Falcon Inn, and of quaint old inns not only in London and the suburbs, but in the country: :\\"Its appearance was very picturesque, standing in the hollow at the corner of St John's HIll and Falcon Road. Being the last stage into London on the high road from Portsmouth, many travellers must know it. The old wych-elm, with a cupboard made of its hollow trunk, and a door hanging on old fashioned rusty hinges, was a striking feature; but the landlord would not 'spare that tree' and it has been grubbed up by the roots. The builder has choked up the well and poured concrete on the sward ... a modern gin-palace will take the place of a low-pitched old tavern with a cross-beamed taproom and a quaint doorway before which a maypole might have been reared...\\" Interior of The Falcon, displaying some of Turtle & Appleton's 1896 work Reopened as The Falcon Hotel, the building is described by the Survey of London as a \\"robust piece of London pub architecture in the Franco-Italianate taste\\", in brick with cement dressings, and having an ornamental turret above the corner gable. The interior of the pub was remodelled in 1896 by the builders Turtle & Appleton, who created an open-plan space by the use of cast-iron columns to support the upper floor, and the introduction of elaborate oak-work and glass-panel illustrations of the ancient inn's life. A billiard room was added to the rear of the Hotel in 1901 by Tavener's widow. Tavener's venture appears to have been a great success, in large part thanks to its location; in 1911 the hotel was employing about 20 people. In 1921, Tavener's son, also John, sold the business for ¬£70,000 to the Wenlock Brewery.

Canadian Press, April 10, 2014. The series originally debuted as a two-hour television movie pilot in October 2013, starring Maggie Grace as young teacher Elizabeth Thatcher and Stephen Amell as Royal Northwest Mounted Police officer Wynn Delaney. In the television series Erin Krakow is cast as her niece, whose name is also Elizabeth Thatcher (played by Poppy Drayton in the movie), and Daniel Lissing plays a Mountie named Jack Thornton, with Lori Loughlin reprising her role as coal mine widow Abigail Stanton. On March 21, 2018, Hallmark renewed the series for a sixth season. The season premiered with a two-hour Christmas special that was broadcast as part of Hallmark's Countdown to Christmas event, and was to continue for a 10-episode run starting in February 2019. However, due to the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal involving Loughlin and her subsequent removal from all Hallmark properties, the season was put on a \\"retooling\\" hiatus and resumed in May to conclude in June, with Loughlin's scenes edited out. On April 13, 2019, the series was renewed for a seventh season which aired from February 23 to April 26, 2020. On April 26, 2020, Hallmark Channel announced via a video from Krakow that the series would return for an eighth season in 2021. Plot When Calls the Heart tells the story of Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow), a young teacher accustomed to her high-society life. She receives her first classroom assignment in Coal Valley, a small coal-mining town in Western Canada which is located just south of Robb, Alberta. There, life is simple, but often fraught with challenges. Elizabeth charms most everyone in Coal Valley, except Royal Northwest Mounted Police Constable Jack Thornton (Daniel Lissing). He believes Thatcher's wealthy father has doomed the lawman's career by insisting he be assigned in town to protect the shipping magnate's daughter. Wishing to thrive in this 1910 coal town, Elizabeth must learn the ways of the Canadian frontier. Abigail Stanton's (Lori Loughlin) husband, the foreman of the mine, and her only son‚Äîalong with 45 other miners, were killed in an explosion, due to the mining-company site manager's irresponsible management and lack of due care in his management of the mine. The newly widowed women find their faith tested when they must go to work in the mine to keep a roof over their heads, food on the table, and help pay the wage for the town's teacher. The town of Coal Valley was renamed Hope Valley in first episode of the second season after the coal mine was closed.

Kola Aluko was ranked by Forbes Africa as one of the Forty Richest Africans, as well as included in the Top Ten list of Successful African Entrepreneurs to Follow on Twitter. The New African Magazine (November 2013 issue) included Aluko in their 100 Most Influential Africans listing and issue. Background Born Kolawole Aluko (Lagos, Nigeria, 20 October 1969), one of nine siblings. Aluko's mother is a pharmacist, his father, Chief Akanni Aluko (Chairman Island Club and High Chief in Ilesha, Osun State, Nigeria) a geologist. Chief Akanni Aluko is the only child of Mrs Adedoja Aluko from Ogbomosho, Oyo State, Nigeria. Kola Aluko attended Igbogbi College in Lagos. Aluko says, he was \\"from an early age very ambitious and I always knew I wanted to work for myself\\". ‚ÄúHighly competitive and keen on sports‚Äù, Aluko's entrepreneurial mind set saw him work in different industries, from pharmaceuticals to cars, before settling for the oil industry in the early 1990s.BBC AFRICA, December 2013  Business career Kola Aluko co-founded Besse Oil, a pioneering oil trading company in Nigeria in 1995. Besse Oil, one of the first to obtain a credit line with major international banks, traded crude oil and fuel oil, and was also a major importer of gasoline. Six years later, in 2001, Aluko founded Fossil Resources, an indigenous downstream oil and gas company, where he held the role of CEO. In 2004, Kola Aluko formed Exoro Energy International, became CEO and moved into exploration and production. Exoro Energy partnered with a division of Weatherford, to showcase its exploration and production technology. In 2007, the division of Weatherford was bought out and merged with Exoro Energy to form an independent company, Seven Energy. Kola Aluko, with a team of Nigerian and international E&P; executives, co-founded Atlantic Energy in 2011, a private upstream oil and gas company, with an increased focus on under-developed producing fields in Nigeria. In partnership with the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) Atlantic Energy focused mainly on Niger Delta assets, contracted and executed under Strategic Alliance Agreements (SAAs) with the NPDC. In 2010, Aluko diversified into the aviation industry, becoming a member of the VistaJet advisory board, assisting with the West-African expansion of the Swiss-based luxury aviation company. Other interests Kola Aluko is a co- founder of Made in Africa (MiAF), a foundation 'set up to support and fund master plans and feasibility studies for transformational and large scale developments and infrastructure projects across the African continent'. MiAF's other co-founder is the Ghanaian fashion designer Oswald Boateng. On 26 September 2013, MiAF launched the Africa50 fund at New York's NASDAQ, Africa's largest infrastructure investment vehicle to date. MiAF, in alliance with the African Development Bank (ADB), aims to raise US$500 million for Africa50 by early 2014. The two institutions are supported by the investment expertise of Capri Global Capital - a US-based investment advisory founded by African- American fund manager Quintin E. Primo III. Aluko, who is based in Nigeria and Switzerland, is a passionate motor sports enthusiast, who races and competes in conjunction with Swiss-based Ferrari team Kessel Racing. In December 2012, Aluko and his Kessel teammates Thomas Kemenater and Maurizio Mediani came third in the final round of the Endurance Champions Cup held at Rome's Vallelunga circuit in Italy. In interviews Aluko often cites the racing car driver Ayrton Senna as a main inspiration, drawing parallels between racing, business and life in general. When asked on his advise for young entrepreneurs, Aluko said, ‚ÄúThe key is focus, focus and again focus. Identify the things you are good at, your strengths, and get to work on your weaknesses. The racing car driver Ayrton Senna, a man who inspired me greatly, is a good example. Senna was an exceptional driver, however, initially he was terrible in wet conditions, compared to racing in the dry. But he identified his weakness, and so every time it rained, he jumped into his car, and practiced, practiced, practiced, until he arguably became the best, wet weather driver in history.\\"Ventures Magazine, January 2014 Controversies Aluko, co businessman Jide Omokore and former Nigeria Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke are currently being investigated for a series of multibillion-dollar fraud and money laundering offences in Nigeria, the United Kingdom and America.

It is a follow up and spin-off of Iron Man 3, and is the fifth film in the Marvel One-Shots short film series. The film is written and directed by Drew Pearce, and is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It stars Ben Kingsley, Scoot McNairy, Lester Speight, and Sam Rockwell, with Kingsley reprising his role from Iron Man 3, and Rockwell reprising his role from Iron Man 2. In All Hail the King, a documentary filmmaker interviews the infamous fake terrorist Trevor Slattery from behind bars. Plot Trevor Slattery, having been captured at the end of Iron Man 3, is now being held in Seagate Prison. At the prison he is living luxuriously, with his own personal \\"butler\\" Herman, and other inmates acting as his fan club and protection. Slattery is interviewed by documentary filmmaker Jackson Norriss, who wishes to chronicle the events of the Mandarin situation seen in Iron Man 3. Norriss, trying to learn more about Slattery personally, recounts his past from his first casting as a child as well as his starring in a failed CBS pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin. Cast * Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery: An inmate at Seagate prison who is the subject of a documentary by Jackson Norriss. Kingsley reprises the role from Iron Man 3. * Scoot McNairy as Jackson Norriss: A member of the Ten Rings terrorist organization posing as a documentary filmmaker. In the comics the character's name is spelled 'Norris', while a video released as part of a viral marketing campaign for Captain America: Civil War in May 2016 revealed that a separate character named Jackson Norris in fact exists elsewhere in the MCU. * Lester Speight as Herman: Slattery's butler and protector in Seagate. * Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer: An inmate at Seagate prison, who was a weapons manufacturer. Rockwell reprises his role from Iron Man 2. On Rockwell's cameo, Pearce explained that both Marvel and Rockwell were \\"on board\\" for it, but Rockwell was unable to do it due to production on the Poltergeist remake. However, during post-production of that film, Rockwell read the script for the short and called Pearce, saying that he was happy to participate if his scenes could be shot in an hour in Toronto. Pearce went to Canada, and \\"Rockwell came in and just nailed it.\\" Additionally, Matt Gerald portrays White Power Dave; Crystal the Monkey portrays the bar monkey; and Allen Maldonado portrays Fletcher Heggs, who has a tattoo of a chess piece on his face as a nod to the comics, where he is a minor character going by \\"Knight\\". Production After Ben Kingsley was attached to All Hail the King, additional crew members signed on. Drew Pearce, the co-screenwriter of Iron Man 3, and producer Stephen Broussard had the idea for the short All Hail the King during the production of Iron Man 3, to provide \\"a fresh take\\" on the Mandarin character. Marvel Studios and consultant Joss Whedon were positive about the short, reliant on Ben Kingsley's involvement. In October 2013, Kingsley said he was working on a secret project with Marvel involving \\"many members of the crew that were involved in Iron Man 3.\\" This was later revealed to be the short, written and directed by Pearce. Iron Man 3 director Shane Black felt Marvel \\"saw so many negative things\\" surrounding the Mandarin's portrayal, that the short was created as \\"an apology to fans who were so angry.\\" Though some of the dialogue is written in response to critics of Iron Man 3s Mandarin portrayal, the story was written simply as an extension of the Ten Rings and Mandarin storyline featured throughout the Iron Man films. Pearce wrote the short to be ambiguous enough that the storyline could be further explored in future films or television series. On the Ten Rings, Pearce stated that he found the group to be a \\"very powerful\\" part of the MCU due to their introduction in the universe's first film, and noted that producer Kevin Feige was excited to see a member of the organization be \\"genuinely vicious\\". Because of this, Pearce worked to make the action in the short \\"real and brutal\\" to juxtapose the more comedic tone leading up to it, which he felt would increase the humor of Kingsley's Slattery anyway given that the character \\"does not respond to anything the same way any other right minded human being\\" should. Speaking about adding easter eggs and nods to the comics, Pearce noted that him adding them to the script did not necessarily mean that they were a part of Marvel's bigger plan for the MCU, and said that he enjoyed \\"stuff[ing] it full of MCU\\" and waiting to see if \\"some of it sticks and some of it remains just a kind of charming nod.\\" The name Caged Heat was previously used by Marvel as the working title for Iron Man 3. The short was filmed in Los Angeles, with Sam Rockwell's cameo filmed in Toronto on a set that was painted to match the Los Angeles shoot. Music for the short was composed by Brian Tyler, with the Caged Heat scenes composed by 1980s TV-music icon Mike Post. The main-on-end title sequence, which was created by Perception, was inspired by Dr. No, Charade, and Iron Monkey, as well as other Kung-Fu exploitation films. Release All Hail the King was released on the digital download release of Thor: The Dark World on February 4, 2014, and on February 25, 2014 for the Blu-ray release. It was included on the bonus-disc of the \\"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection\\" box set, which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as the other Marvel One-Shots. The collection features audio commentary by Pearce and Kingsley, and was released on December 8, 2015. Reception IGN's Cliff Wheatley gave All Hail the King a 9.4 out of 10. He said that it's \\"a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it's the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from Iron Man 3 in a sort of referential way, but it's nothing too damaging.\\" Devin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death called the short \\"another excellent short film from the folks at Marvel Studios\\", which he felt deserved to be shown in theaters rather than just released on home media. He felt that the character of Slattery \\"was used the perfect amount in Iron Man Three, and giving him more screen time here, in a side project, feels the right way to return to him. Kingsley is having a blast, delivering plenty of wonderful jokes and sinking right into the clueless, egocentric character who represents all of our worst stereotypes of actors.\\" Faraci praised the Caged Heat sequence, as well as Rockwell's cameo, and positively stated on the Mandarin reveal, \\"rather than a retcon this feels like an expansion, a pulling back of the curtain to reveal more of the picture.\\" Conversely, Andrew Wheeler of Comics Alliance criticized the short's presentation of homosexuality, given it was Marvel Studio's first attempt to bring LGBT concepts into the MCU.

A native of New York, Shuman worked at several small local newspapers until he secured a position at the Syracuse Journal in 1853. He left the position in 1856 to work as an assistant editor for the Chicago Evening Journal, a predecessor of the Chicago Sun-Times. He was elected the 21st Lieutenant Governor of Illinois in 1876. A leading candidate for the Illinois governorship in 1880, Shuman instead decided to increase his role at the Evening Journal and retired from politics. Biography Andrew Shuman was born in Manor, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on November 8, 1830. His father died when he was seven years old and Shuman was left in the care of his uncle. When he was fifteen years old, Shuman took an apprenticeship with the Lancaster Union and Sentinel. He followed the newspaper when operations were moved to Auburn, New York and it was renamed the Auburn Advertiser. Shuman left the paper when he was eighteen to start his own, the Auburnian. A year later, he became a partner at the Cayuga Chief, a widely circulated weekly newspaper. Shuman attended Hamilton College in Clinton from 1851 to 1853. He left the college to become an editor for the Syracuse Journal. The newspaper had a reputation as one of the strongest Republican papers in the state of New York. He worked there for three years, whereupon he took a position as assistant editor at the Chicago Evening Journal in Chicago, Illinois. He rose to the position of editor-in-chief. He married Lucy H. Dunlap in 1855. In 1865, Shuman was appointed Illinois Penitentiary commissioner, a role he served for six years. In 1876, Shuman was elected Lieutenant Governor of Illinois as a Republican on a ticket with Shelby Moore Cullom. Shuman was a candidate for Governor of Illinois in 1880, running against Cullom. However, before a candidate was nominated, Shuman withdrew from the race to assume the role of proprietor of the Evening Journal. Shuman retired in 1888 over concerns about his health; he died of heart disease at his home in Evanston, Illinois on May 5, 1890.

The program was established in 1976 to produce CRMs for inorganic and organic marine environmental analysis and remains internationally recognized producer of CRMs. Inorganic CRMs Since 2011, the reference material for the isotopic composition of natural mercury, NIMS-1, is basis for the standard atomic weight of mercury NRC produces certified reference materials of biological tissues, isotopic standards, natural waters, sediments, supplements, and natural health products. With the exception of the ORMS, the river water CRM with elevated mercury, all materials contain natural levels of analytes in their native matrix. * Biological tissues ** DOLT, dogfish liver for trace metals ** DORM, fish protein for trace metals ** LUTS, non-defatted lobster hepatopancreas for trace metals ** TORT, lobster hepatopancreas for trace metals * Isotopic materials ** NIMS, natural inorganic mercury standard ** EMMS, isotopic methylmercury standard * Natural waters ** CASS, near-shore seawater for trace metals ** MOOS, seawater for nutrients ** NASS, seawater for trace metals ** ORMS, river water for mercury ** SLEW, estuarine water for trace metals ** SLRS, river water for trace metals * Sediments ** HISS and MESS, marine sediment for trace metals and major constituents ** PACS and SOPH, marine sediment for trace metals and major constituents * Supplements and natural health products ** CACB, calcium carbonate for lead and cadmium ** FEBS, otolith for trace metals ** SELM, selenium-enriched yeast for selenium Organic CRMs In 1977, Edmonds et al. reported the identification, isolation, and synthesis of major arsenic-containing substance in sea organisms, the arsenobetaine. In 1999, NRC certified arsenobetaine in the dogfish muscle material DORM-2, which became the first matrix reference material certified for arsenobetaine. Before DORM-2, DORM-1 (issued in 1986) served as the reference material for which the concentration of arsenobetaine was widely reported in scientific literature. Besides arsenobetaine, NRC currently offers matrix reference materials certified for methylmercury (TORT-3), dibutyltin, and tributyltin (PACS-3). * Biological tissues and sediments ** CARP, fish for dioxins, furans, and PCBs ** DOLT, dogfish liver for methylmercury ** DORM, fish protein for methylmercury ** TORT, lobster hepatopancreas for methylmercury and arsenobetaine ** PACS and SOPH, marine sediment for dibutyltin and tributyltin ** SELM, selenium-enriched yeast for methionine and selenomethionine Biotoxin CRMs NRC's domoic acid standard was the first biotoxin reference material in the world In 1987 Canada witnessed a crisis in the seafood industry.

Background The brothers Maurice (1877‚Äì1970) and Georges Sizaire (1880‚Äì1924) founded the Sizaire-Naudin company in 1903. In 1912 the Sizaire brothers left the Sizaire- Naudin company, however, following disagreement with an investor. History of the business Share of the Sizaire-Berwick Ltd, issued 29. September 1922 Nevertheless, the Sizaire brothers‚Äô participation in the automotive business was far from over and, in 1913, with the help of Frederick William Berwick, the London-based UK importer of Corre La Licorne cars, they obtained finance in London for the launch of a new automobile manufacturing company called Sizaire-Berwick., p. 120 The new company produced large luxury cars. The pre- cars were produced at the brothers‚Äô homebase in Courbevoie, on the northern edge of Paris, but 80% of the production was shipped to England where they received their bodies, mostly fitted by Berwick's own coachbuilder located at Highgate, on the north side of London.

In August 1913 he was sent to work as a mechanic in Paris and to drive completed chassis to the coast. By the time war broke out in 1914, 139 cars had been produced. In 1915, Berwick built a new factory at Park Royal, a London suburb used initially for the production of aeroplanes. Following the outbreak of peace, Berwick founded, in 1919, the company F. W. Berwick & Co Ltd and in 1920 he started production of British-built Sizaire-Berwicks. These continued to be produced until 1925. In 1919, the French end of the business was acquired by an American named Burke. He started out by importing cars from Berwick's factory in England, but very soon after this the company was again producing cars at Courbevoie. In 1923, Austin gained a controlling share in the British end of the business. By the end of 1922, none of the firm's founders was active in the company. The Sizaire brothers were busy with the new Sizaire Fr√®res business while Berwick was involved with another Luxury automaker called Windsor. Sizaire-Berwicks continued to emerge, albeit in small numbers, from the Courbevoie factory till 1927. At least four French produced Sizaire-Berwicks were believed to have survived in 2010. The cars The first Sizaire-Berwick came with 3014 cm3 engine supplied by Decolange. This was quickly replaced with a 4-litre (20 CV) monobloc unit. The radiator grill on the early cars very closely resembled that of a Rolls-Royce, but, with litigation looming, the flat fronted grill on the Sizaire-Berfwick was replaced with one that featured a shallow V-shaped profile. At the Paris Motor Show in October 1919 Sizaire-Berwick took a stand and exhibited a \\"torpedo\\" bodied car powered by a 4-cylinder engine of 4523 cm3. Four cylinder engines of this size were by now unusual, but this one was described as a \\"very smooth-running\\" unit. Maximum power was listed at 60 hp, achieved at just 2000 rpm. With a wheelbase, the car continued Sizaire-Berwick's large car tradition established in 1913. Five years later, at the Paris Motor Show in October 1924 Sizaire-Berwick were still taking a stand and exhibiting a car with the same 4523 cm3 engine as before, but with the wheelbase now extended to . In 1925, the manufacture entered one of their 4¬Ω-litre engine cars in the Le Mans 24 Hour race, but the car completed only 23 laps and was not classified. Two years after that, Sizaire-Berwick appeared at the Paris Motor Show for the last time, displaying a large luxury car, now with a 6-cylinder engine from Lycoming of Pennsylvania. After 1923, with Austin having taken a controlling share, the British end of the Sizaire Berwick business offered two models with Austin 1861 cm3 and 3610 cm3 four cylinder engines, as well as a 3397 cm3 six cylinder unit. The last British Sizaire-Berwicks were produced in 1925.

It was founded on October 31, 1861 and is one of 162 German Student Corps in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Latvia and Hungary today. The Corps is a member of the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC), the second oldest federation of classical Fraternities in Europe with roots dating back to the 15th century.Die Corps. \\"Was sind die Corps? - Who are the Corps?\\" http://www.die-corps.de/interessenten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013.Klimczuk, Stephen & Warner, Gerald. \\"Secret Places, Hidden Sanctuaries: Uncovering Mysterious Sites, Symbols, and Societies\\".

Four presidents (\\"Rektor\\") of Dresden University of Technology, Dresden's largest university with approximately 30.000 students, are among the list of members of the fraternity, underlining the deep connection between the Corps and the local alma mater. The connections with the university and the city of Dresden go far back to the fraternity's early beginnings in the late 19th century, with members aspiring to drive developments for the university over the course of history. Two major accomplishments were (1) ensuring the university's recognition by developing the former Technical Institute into the Royal Saxon Technical College of Dresden in the late 1800s and (2) founding of today's Studentenwerk Dresden in the early 1900s as the university's student council. Outside of the university's circles, many of the fraternity's members drove developments in the architectural style and design of several of Dresden's buildings such as the \\"Dresden's Neuer Bahnhof\\".Corps Altsachsen: Hundert Jahre Corps Altsachsen. 1.

Membership in the fraternity is open to honorable men studying at one of Dresden's universities and is based exclusively on personality, good moral standing, and strength of character.Die Corps. \\"Prinzipien der Corps\\" An article explaining the principles of being a Corps Student: http://www.die-corps.de/prinzipien.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013. Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and engage in the tradition of academic fencing as a way to sharpen and prove their character under pressure. Continuing a practice dating back into the 1700s, Altsachsen's members wear the traditional couleur, colored stripes, in grey-green-gold. The fraternity teaches and expects tolerance from its members, who are stemming from very diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds.  Fundamentals and principles  Like all German Student Corps, Altsachsen expects tolerance from its members in political, scientific and religious affairs. Members are encouraged to have their own point of view about the world and be able to argue it, but Altsachsen as an entity always remains neutral. This neutrality is a fundamental pillar of all Corps and differentiates them from fraternities who require a certain political or religious affinity. The fraternity encourages freshly admitted (pledging \\"fox\\") members with diverse ethnic, national, religious and political backgrounds to prove themselves as valuable Corps brothers, purely on the basis of personal character and merit, before becoming eligible to be fully incorporated (Rezeption). The fraternity has about 200 members of all ages (including alumni) coming from or currently residing in Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa. Every full member is a member for life. Academic \\"Mensur\\" fencing in 1900. Steel goggles were added to protect the eyes and nose nowadays. Members of the Corps Altsachsen value and practice the tradition of engagements in academic fencing, or \\"Mensur\\" in German, with members of other old-school fraternities. Academic fencing, originating in the German school of fencing, is understood as a way to exercise good judgement and prove character, allowing participants to show determination by standing their ground under pressure, while enhancing the bonds between the Corps brothers at the same time.Die Corps. \\"Hoch bitte ‚Äì Los!\\" An article explaining the role of academic fencing at Corps: http://www.die-corps.de/fechten.0.html Retrieved on Oct. 7, 2013. Mark Twain described one of these fencing duels/challenges in his day and age; his description is remarkably similar to current practices. Altsachsen's members identify themselves wearing the traditional couleur, colored stripes, as well as caps and/or other specific garments at official occasions. This tradition, known as \\"wearing colors\\" (German: Farben tragen), provides means to recognize members of other fraternities and, likewise, identification for the Corps brothers with each other and their traditions. Rhetoric evenings in the fraternity's old-school bar are similar in style to a knight academy lecture as depicted. Altsachsen's members value the art of rhetoric. The tradition is kept alive by both impromptu or \\"stand-up and talk\\" speeches (Stegreifrede in German) as well as elaborate platform presentations typical of industry and academia. All members must present a significant number of such talks and are graded on their presentation skills. In order to become a full member, pledge members must pass a curriculum of predetermined talks in front of their peers and guests. Activity and responsibility are two fundamental expectations for fraternity members. With the goal to achieve members who are prepared to become active leaders in society, every Corps brother is expected to hold a leadership position at least once for a term (\\"Semester\\") while a student. Members are further encouraged to organize internal and open fraternity events that draw attention from other fraternities and guests from industry, academia, politics and other active societies. Allocating the necessary resources appropriately and living up to set expectations teaches responsibility. All members must show active participation in the regular fraternity Convents, providing the foundation for the fraternity's members to meet and discuss past, present and future developments. Decisions are cast in a democratic manner, sometimes after intense debates. Participation at such Convents teaches a better understanding of proper argumentation, group dynamics and critical analysis of other members' views, plans and arguments, thereby preparing its participants to become active members of society. Similarly, every member must finish his higher educational degree with good academic standing in order to advance to the status of Alter Herr (alumnus). Long-term guidance is expected from and provided by said Alte Herren, who often remain very engaged and well connected with the fraternity. Every year at the end of May, student and alumni members of all German Student Corps meet in one of two cities (Weinheim and Bad K√∂sen) for three days to refresh their bonds with their fraternity and friends from the entire Corps network (WSC/KSCV). In addition to these international meetings once a year, alumni join the student members for multiple local meetings, lasting an evening or a weekend. These regular meetings result in strong bonds spanning the generations within the fraternity.  History = Foundation as Rhetoric Society in 19th century Dresden = Br√ºhl's Terrace in 1890. The fraternity was founded on October 31, 1861, at the Br√ºhl's Terrace in Dresden's city center as the Rhetoric Society by students of Dresden's former Institute of Technology, now the Dresden University of Technology. The name chosen for the new fraternity was originally Polyhymnia, after the muse of sacred poetry, rhetoric and eloquence. The founders strongly believed that a rhetoric education and discourse should be part of a complete humanistic higher education. The colors grey-green-gold were chosen to represent the fraternity's principles focusing on academia (grey), being full of fresh energy and hope for its principles (green), and valuing friendship among fraternity brothers (gold). The strong connection to the fraternity's founding location is often revived with a rhetoric get-together at Br√ºhl's Terrace and spontaneous afternoon pub gatherings near the river Elbe as well as lavish balls throughout the year. Bismarck's student sword and helmet, comparable to those used by Altsachsen's members then and now. By 1868, the fraternity had adopted the tradition of academic fencing or \\"Mensur\\" challenges (back then \\"duels\\") with members of other proper fraternities and had changed its official name to Akademische Verbindung Polyhymnia (Academic Fraternity Polyhymnia). The motto \\"Litteris et amicitiae\\" (Science and Friendship) was adopted on June 25, 1880.Festschrift zur Feier des f√ºnfzigj√§hrigen Bestehens der freischlagenden Verbindung \\"Polyhymnia\\" an der Technischen Hochschule zu Dresden. Technische Hochschule Dresden, 1911. The fraternity's coat of arms was chosen in the same year, depicting the one-headed black eagle of the time of the German Empire (1871-1918) instead of the two-headed eagle at the time of the fraternity's foundation. = Influencing the development of the Technical Institute of Dresden = Dresden's main university, today's Technical University (short: TU) Dresden was founded in 1828 as one of the first technical institutes of the world, then called \\"Technical School of Saxony\\". After Saxony joined the newly formed German Empire in 1871, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute (K√∂niglich- S√§chsisches Polytechnikum). At this point in time, topics not connected with technology, such as history and languages, were introduced to the school curriculum. Several of Altsachsen's fraternity members were in high-ranking institute and government positions and had an influential role by lobbying Saxony's state government to recognize the technical institute as a higher education provider with polytechnical merits, which resulted in yet another name change to K√∂niglich-S√§chsischen Technischen Hochschule Dresden (Royal- Saxon Technical College of Dresden) in 1890.Corps Altsachsen: Hundert Jahre Corps Altsachsen. 1. Auflage. K√∂ln 1961, S. 86. To honor the recognition of the educational institution, the fraternity established the academic principle (akademische Prinzip). This meant that every member could only become an alumnus after graduating with a higher academic degree and in good academic standing, an initiative by fraternity member and Honorary Senator Fritz Zeuner, son of the former president of the Poly-technical Institute Gustav Zeuner. They and others in the fraternity significantly influenced the college's course, eventually leading to the college's privilege to graduate students with doctoral degrees in 1900. Aside from traditional doctoral graduations, the university was also allowed to honor exceptional scientists and businessmen as honorary doctors; the first such honor was granted to Friedrich August Siemens.Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift Der Technischen Universit√§t Dresden, Volume 18, Issue 5, Technischen Universit√§t Dresden, 1969 TU Dresden. = Foundation of Franconia = During the late 1800s, fraternities began forming fraternity circles and umbrella organizations. Differences in opinion about tolerance and general politics led to the end of honorable greeting and fencing with certain types of fraternities, such as the Cheruscia Dresden in 1899. This led to problems trying to maintain a high level of fencing engagements among similar fraternities, which is why five of Polyhymnia's fraternity brothers founded the \\"fencing fraternity Franconia Dresden\\" (\\"Freischlagende Verbindung Franconia\\", later \\"Corps Franconia Dresden\\") in Juli of 1899. Monetary stimulus for the new fraternity was provided by Polyhymnia's alumni-organisation. Both \\"fencing fraternities\\", not yet Corps at that point, formed the Dresden Fraternity Cartel (\\"Dresdner Verbindungs-Cartell\\" D.V.C.) to rival and engage in regular social and fencing events.Hans Sch√ºler: Weinheimer S.C.-Chronik, Darmstadt 1927, S. 434-454Michael Doeberl, Alfred Bienengr√§ber: Das akademische Deutschland, Volume 2, C.A. Weller, 1931. = Joining the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent = To guarantee her members reliable means to fence with other fraternities of like principles, Polyhymnia joint the Weinheimer Senioren-Convent (WSC) in 1927 and was renamed Corps Altsachsen.Karlheinz Blaschke, Holger Starke, Uwe John: Geschichte der Stadt Dresden, Volume 3, Theiss Verlag, 2006, S. 182. The name change from Polyhymnia to Corps Altsachsen happened in compliance with WSC rules for fraternity names at that time. Likewise, most of the local fraternities merged to form similar umbrella organizations in the following years. From that point on, most of the social activity, such as eloquent balls as well as fencing engagements became limited to like-minded fraternities, the German Student Corps. = Suspension during times of the national socialist rule = Similar to other fraternities who encouraged their members to have their own free thought and will, members of the Corps Altsachsen felt the increasing pressure of national socialist surveillance as well as political pressure in the early 1930s. A similar-minded fraternity, Corps Makaria Dresden, fused with the Corps Altsachsen in 1934, which strengthened bonds and numbers within the fraternity. Still, as political pressures in Nazi Germany had increased to dangerous levels for fraternities during the next years, Corps Altsachsen officially suspended activities in 1936. During the 1930s, eventually all corps abiding by a free democratic order did the same as their view of the world was in stark contrast to the so-called F√ºhrerprinzip (F√ºhrer-principle), where one person governs essentially as dictator instead of relying on a democratic, consensus-based majority in a convent.

Universit√§t zu K√∂ln, Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, 1972 and soon fused with the smaller Corps Gothia Dresden in 1953. Originally located in K√∂ln- Lindenthal, Altsachsen soon moved to K√∂ln-Marienburg, where it stayed until the Iron Curtain collapsed. During the Soviet dictatorship in East Germany, fraternities abiding by free will and common consensus were again not allowed to exist as they could not be controlled by the Socialist Party. Following Germany's reunification in 1989, the fraternity returned to Dresden in 1994 with the aid of the Blaues Kartell, a circle of four like-minded fraternities that Altsachsen had joined in 1993. The Blaues Kartell today includes the Corps Saxo-Thuringia M√ºnchen in Munich, Corps Hannoverania in Hanover and Corps Berlin in Berlin. In 1997, the Corps Altsachsen transitioned its headquarters to its newly remodeled fraternity house on Weissbachstreet 1, right in the middle of the Campus of the Dresden University of Technology, thereby reconnecting with its traditional roots. Steamboat at Br√ºhl's Terrace = Today = The fraternity is known for its strong commitment to the university and its rhetoric traditions as well as lavish social events. Among these are regular boat parties on Dresden's steam boats as well as traditional balls allowing the Corps brothers to enjoy waltz, Latin or many other forms of ballroom dance.Webpage of the Corps Altsachsen - \\"Aktuelles\\" showing current events http://www.altsachsen.de Retrieved on Oct. 29, 2013.

Also Pablo de Sarasate, whose opus 23, no. 2 is a version of the dance scored for violin and piano. The piece is replete with harmonics, double stops, left hand pizzicatos, and is often performed by young virtuosos. In flamenco, zapateado also refers to a style of dancing which accents the percussive effect of the footwork (zapatear is a Spanish verb, and zapato means \\"shoe\\").Andres Batista, Maestros y Estilos.

The Trincomalee peninsula, which was home to internally displaced civilians, who had earlier been displaced from their homes as a result of the 1983 Anti-Tamil pogrom and the subsequent outbreak of the Civil War two years earlier. In a succession of events that spanned over two months, scores of Tamil civilians were massacred and thousands were driven out by the Sri Lankan military and Sinhalese mobs in order to colonize the area. Background The East and particularly Trincomalee District has been a particular focus of the State in its attempts to suppress Tamil nationalist aspirations by administrative measures backed by brute force. Sinhalisation of Trincomalee was seen as the key to sundering the contiguity of Tamil habitations in the North and East.http://www.sangam.org/articles/view2/?uid=633 A measure put into force in April 1984 was to foment clashes between the Tamils and Muslims in the East. In Amparai and Batticaloa District, this was achieved by getting Muslim hoodlums of Minister M.H. Mohamed down from Colombo to attack some Tamil villages adjoining Muslim villages with backing from the newly inducted Special Task Force. In Mutur such attempts were thwarted by the timely action of A.L.A. Majeed MP. List of massacres Following is an incomplete list containing records of only reported and known massacres based on the availability of data. =May=May 3 On May 3, 50 Tamil people will killed by the Sri Lankan military and Sinhalese mobs in Thehiwaththa and Mahintapuram. Tamil inhabitants of these villages were ethnically cleansed and Sinhalese settlers took their places. May 23 The Army and the newly inducted Sinhalese home guards commenced attacks on outlying Tamil villages in the Trincomalee District, in Nilaveli on 23 May 1985 and in the Allai settlement scheme south of Mutur the next day. Eight civilians were shot dead by the Military in Nilaveli on 23.05.1985. May 24 More than ten people from Anpuvalipuram, who had gone in search of firewood never returned home. Their bulls and carts were found later. And their deaths were attributed to the home guards or the military. May 25 11 civilians are shot dead in Pankulam village, and houses of the residents burnt down. A father and his 12-year-old son who were travelling to visit their family in the nearby village of Kankuveli were hacked to death by the Sinhalese home guards. Their bodies were disposed at the Kankuveli tank. May 26 Over 40 houses and property belonging to Tamils in Echchilampattu were set fire. Two civilians were killed. On the same day, several fishermen from the district were shot dead by the Sri Lankan Navy while they were fishing. Bodies of three fishermen were recovered. May 27 On 27 May 1985, a bus belonging to the State bus service CTB, was stopped at 52nd Milepost in Mahintapura and 6 of its passengers and its driver Pushparaja, all Tamils, were killed in cold blood and their bodies burnt by Sinhala mobs assisted by the home guards. May 31 On the night of 31 May a police party with home guards took away 37 Tamils from the south bank of Killiveddy. =June=June 3 A bus carrying 13 Tamils was burned in Trincomalee. Mr. A. Thangathurai, a former Member of Parliament, was the only survivor and witness of the incident. June 5 On 5 June 1985, an air force helicopter flew over Thiriyai, the surviving northernmost Tamil village in Trincomalee District, firing at residents (Amarivayal and Thennamaravady villages had been uprooted seven months earlier). Air Force personnel then came in trucks with explosives and set fire to 700 houses. People who remained took refuge in the local school. =August=August 10 on 10 August 1985, the Army arrived again at Thiriyai and opened fire targeting some of the leaders, killing among 10 persons, a principal and a village headman. =September=September 9 The last of the large-scale attacks was launched on Trincomalee town itself on 9 September 1985. Under cover provided by the Army, firing from the air by the Air Force and from the sea by naval gunboats, mainly Sinhalese home guards moved in to loot, burn and to kill. 25 civilians were killed and about 1500 houses and places of worship were destroyed.

The \\"digital protest\\" took place on February 11, 2014 with more than 6,000 participating websites, which primarily took the form of webpage banner-advertisements that read, \\"Dear Internet, we're sick of complaining about the NSA. We want new laws that curtail online surveillance. Today we fight back.\\" Organizers hoped lawmakers would be made aware \\"that there's going to be ongoing public pressure until these reforms are instituted.\\" The protest was announced on January 10, 2014, by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Other early organizers included digital rights groups such as Fight for the Future, and Free Press, as well as social media website Reddit, Firefox producer Mozilla, collaborative blogging website Boing Boing, and populist advocacy group '\\"The Other 98%\\". According to the official website, the protest asked U.S. \\"legislators to oppose the FISA Improvements Act, support the USA Freedom Act, and enact protections for non- Americans.\\" Protest organizers said roughly 96,000 calls were placed to members of Congress and 555,000 \\"pro-privacy emails\\" were sent via the website. Purpose The Day We Fight Back was intended as a day of \\"worldwide solidarity\\" in protest against NSA surveillance. It was at once an action against censorship and surveillance, and a commemoration of late \\"open- Internet activist\\" Aaron Swartz. In the US, a main goal of the protest was to encourage passage of the USA Freedom Act, a bill that seeks to reign in telephone data collection. Additionally, the banner urged people to call Congress and voice opposition to the FISA Improvements Act, which the ACLU called \\"a dream come true for the NSA\\" that would \\"codify the NSA's unconstitutional call-records program and allow bulk collection of location data from mobile phone users.\\" Outside the US, the goal was similar. A Guardian op-ed described the activists' objective globally as \\"to push authorities toward policies favoring liberty and privacy\\". Organizers posted to their website: \\"Together we will push back against powers that seek to observe, collect, and analyze our every digital action.Together, we will make it clear that such behavior is not compatible with democratic governance. Together, if we persist, we will win this fight.\\" Rainey Reitman, director of activism at the EFF, said, \\"The idea is to really harness the outrage of the Internet community in speaking out in one big voice on Feb. 11.\\" The protest comes a month after President Obama made a surveillance reform speech introducing his proposed changes to the collection of US citizens' data. Critics said the reformations wouldn't be \\"nearly enough.\\" Organizers compared the February protest with the SOPA protest two years prior, saying, \\"Today we face a different threat, one that undermines the Internet and the notion that any of us live in a genuinely free society\\". The threats were 'International counterparts like Five Eyes and Tempora, mass surveillance, and programs such as PRISM, Canada's CSEC airport monitoring activities'. Background= Promotion = The Day We Fight Back was promoted in a trailer for an upcoming documentary about Aaron Swartz, currently titled The Internet's Own Boy. In the clip, the late activist comments on mass surveillance: \\"It is shocking to think that the accountability is so lax that they don't even have sort of basic statistics about how big the spying programme is. If the answer is, 'Oh, we're spying on so many people we can't possibly even count them,' then that's an awful lot of people.\\" Five months after Swartz's death, the scale of a vast global surveillance program would be revealed in great detail through the release of top-secret NSA documents by Edward Snowden. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! promoted The Day We Fight Back in an opinion article in the Athens News, noting Swartz's role in the digital rights movement calling for \\"another fight for the freedom of the Internet\\" without him. =Reddit \\"Ask Me Anything\\" = Comparing the opposition to surveillance with the previous defeat of SOPA, in which Demand Progress and Aaron Swartz had been deeply involved, the organizers took to Reddit and called for a month of activities culminating in the February 11 \\"day of action\\" In an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" (AMA) discussion held on January 10, several organizers announced the action and fielded user questions, saying their purpose was to answer questions \\"about Aaron and a protest we're organizing on 02/11 in his honor\\". Those participating were Cory Doctorow of BoingBoing; Brian Knappenberger, who made the films The Internet's Own Boy, a documentary about Aaron Swartz, and We Are Legion, a film about the hacker group \\"Anonymous\\"; David Segal, co-founder of Demand Progress; Peter Eckersley of EFF; and Sina Khanifar, website developer for \\"The Day We Fight Back\\" and several other activist projects. Doctorow and Eckersley indicated they had been close friends of Swartz. On February 11, organizers again held an AMA and issued the following statement: :Two years ago, reddit and its users joined in fighting back against dangerous Internet censorship legislation during the SOPA protests. You blacked out your websites and started hundreds of creative campaigns to defeat a piece of legislation that threatened freedom on the Internet. :In the last 6 months we've seen that government agencies, namely the NSA and GCHQ and others, have broken laws and twisted legal interpretations to create an infrastructure of mass surveillance of all of us online. This creates a dark form of censorship as people become afraid to speak freely -- and it's one that undermines our security and our right to privacy as well. As users of the Internet, we have a responsibility to defend its freedom. =Inspiration from Aaron Swartz = Aaron Swartz Aaron Swartz was an American activist who founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). Swartz, a fellow at Harvard, was arrested by MIT police after systematically downloading academic journal articles from JSTOR. The US Department of Justice charged Aaron Swartz with multiple felonies. He faced a potential penalty of 35 years confinement in a federal penitentiary. On January 11, 2013, two days after the prosecution denied his lawyer's second offer of a plea bargain, Swartz was found dead, having hanged himself. Many commentators viewed the prosecution, which could have imposed a devastating prison term for accessing information in bulk rather than one article at a time, as 'bullying' that ultimately lead to Swartz's death. February 11, 2014, the planned day of protest, falls one month after the first anniversary of the death of Aaron Swartz. Swartz's brother, Noah Swartz, is \\"actively organizing\\" The Day We Fight Back. David Segal said in a statement, In the clip, Swartz comments on mass surveillance, Related events \\"Your world delivered ... to the NSA. On AT&T; building in SF where whistleblower Mark Klein saw the NSA spying room.\\" Tweeted by Kurt Opsohl, attorney with the EFF; from \\"The Day We Fight Back\\" protest in San Francisco, February 11, 2014 Related demonstrations were scheduled in 15 countries. Activities to support the protest took place \\"from Argentina to Uganda, from Colombia to the Philippines\\". Events included: *Bitbureauet, a Denmark-based think-tank, announced plans for a protest outside the US embassy in Copenhagen, using the slogan \\"tag internettet tilbage\\" ('take back the internet'). *Restore the Fourth, an American organization, planned a protest outside the AT&T; Building in San Francisco that houses Room 641A, the facility operated by AT&T; for the U.S. National Security Agency. According to the organization, the protest will feature a speech by Mark Klein, the AT&T; technician who publicly exposed the facility in 2006. The EFF has announced plans for an event in Bluffdale, Utah, near the Utah Data Center. The Rhode Island Coalition to Defend Human and Civil Rights and Rhode Island MoveOn.org announced a protest outside federal courthouse in Providence.http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/RI-groups-protest- federal-government-surveillance-5224024.php *The Pirate Party of Sweden will hold a demonstration in Stockholm with speeches by party founder Rick Falkvinge and party leader Anna Troberg.

The coalition included the Open Rights Group, English Pen, Liberty, Privacy International, Big Brother Watch and Article 19. Supporters Supporting the digital protest was a \\"broad coalition of activist groups, companies, and online platforms\\". The Guardian observed that supporters included unlikely bedfellows, citing backing from both American Civil Liberties Union and the \\"very conservative\\" FreedomWorks. Political parties supporting the protest included the US National Libertarian Party, the Australian Greens, the Pirate Party of Sweden, and Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty. Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX) has also endorsed the protest. The \\"most prominent addition\\" to the protest was the \\"Reform Government Surveillance\\" coalition, which includes AOL, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Yahoo. It was not initially clear how the sites would participate. The group sent a letter to President Obama on November 11 and \\"urged changes that would include a government agreement not to collect bulk data from Internet communications.\\" On the same day, Google announced its support for the USA Freedom Act, saying \\"Google recognizes the very real threats that the U.S. and other countries face, but we strongly believe that government surveillance programs should operate under a legal framework that is rule-bound, narrowly tailored, transparent, and subject to oversight.\\" Matt Simons, director of social and economic justice at ThoughtWorks, nevertheless said the coalition's support of The Day We Fight Back \\"rings a little hollow\\" because of the late date of its announcement and its member's past disclosure of their customers' data to the NSA. Groups supporting The Day We Fight Back include the EFF, the ACLU, Freedomworks, Greenpeace, Demand Progress, Human Rights Watch, the Government Accountability Project,http://www.whistleblower.org/blog/48-2014/3183-today-the-day-we-fight- back-goes-global Restore the Fourth, the Free Software Foundation, and Amnesty International. Websites supporting the protest included Reddit, Tumblr, Wikia, Mozilla, Facebook, and Google. February 11, 2014 By February 11, more than 6,000 websites and organizations had signed up to show support by featuring The Day We a Fight Back banner for 24 hours. The Huffington Post released images of various memes meant to be posted to sites like Facebook and Twitter as part of the event. Tens of thousands of individuals pledged to make calls and Internet posts supporting surveillance reform. Reaction By mid-day, organizers said supporters had sent 104,000 emails and made nearly 50,000 calls to Congress. On Twitter, the hashtag \\"StopTheNSA\\" became a 'trending' topic. Joining tech companies and public figures, lawmakers voiced support using the online platform, including Tom Udall, Jerry Nadler, Rick Larsen, Ron Wyden, Raul M. Grijalva, Mike Honda, Mark Pocan, Alan Grayson, and Rand Paul. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) posted: > What I worry about is kids growing up in a society where they say 'if I send > this email or if I visit this website, then somebody may think I'm a > terrorist.

It upsets me very much and is not the kind of free society I > think we should be living in. As February 11 drew to a close, The New York Times posted a blog titled \\"The Day the Internet Didn't Fight Back,\\" reporting that \\"the protest on Tuesday barely registered. Wikipedia did not participate. Reddit ... added an inconspicuous banner to its homepage. Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and DuckDuckGo, which were listed as organizers, did not include the banner on their homepages.

Plot Set in contemporary Vienna, the film involves a photographer, Anna, who discovers that extraterrestrial beings are colonizing the minds of her fellow citizens by raising the human aggression quotient. The outer world immediately becomes disjointed, yet the inner world does too, as Anna and her lover, Peter, try to hang onto their deteriorating relationship. Cast *Susanne Widl as Anna *Peter Weibel as Peter *Josef Plavec *Monica Helfer-Friedrich *Dominick Dusek *Herbert Schmid *Edward Neversal *Helke Sander Release The film was released on DVD by Facets Multi-Media in 2011 in a limited edition of 500 copies. Reception Critical opinion regarding the film has been overwhelmingly positive. The Village Voice critic J. Hoberman, who in 1981 included the film in his list of the ten best films commercially released in the United States during that year, more recently wrote that the film is one \\"of the richest avant-garde features of the 1970s\\" and praised its \\"winning combination of sexual frankness and visual wit,\\" while another critic, Dennis Schwartz, wrote that the \\"film's beauty is derived from its sexual frankness and playfully drawn out intimate relationship scenes, witty use of photography, and its originality as it breaks free of conventional unities of body, space and time. Export skillfully edits montage and integrates video, still photography, and performance art with elements from Cubism, Surrealism, Dada and avant-garde cinema.\\" Artforum noted in November 1980 that \\"[w]atching their scenes together, we realize how seldom, if ever before, the details of sexual intimacy have been shown in film from the point of view from a woman. Export privileges rupture over unity and never settles for one-dimensional solutions\\" and it was called one \\"of the most original films in this year's exposition\\" and a \\"tour de force of cinematic invention\\" grounded in the director's \\"fresh and intelligent sensibility, characteristically self-referential. Her visual resources include mirrors, still photography, video, dance, and films within the film, all employed with a bold and surprising inventiveness\\" by the catalogue notes of the 1978 Los Angeles International Film Exposition. Similarly, critic Alison Butler wrote that the \\"film is a witty and visually brilliant essay on gender and experience, culture and environment\\" and program notes used by the San Francisco Cinematheque during a screening quote critic Amy Taubin as opining that the film \\"makes you reconsider what you and everyone else is doing ‚Äì in life and in art\\" and critic Steve Anker underscoring that it is an important \\"crossover film\\" combining \\"avant-garde and theatrical sensibilities, made during the mid-1970s. It chronicles the nightmarish breakdown of a fashion photographer as she confronts her waning identity and security as a career woman; blending narrative experimentation, fantasy, fact and theoretical critique, it has enormous impact on independent features which followed it.\\" PopMatters noted that the film has \\"enough originality to nag at patient viewers and get at least partially under our skin\\" and critic Michael Atkinson wrote that it is a \\"weird, restless, beguilingly offbeat bit of dreamwork.\\" The film was presented for the first time at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1977, it has won a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was recently called \\"seminal\\" during a screening at a repertory cinema, \\"a strong and humoristic showdown\\" at another and \\"a sonically-complex, montage-rich, darkly funny and uriniferous cornerstone of avant-garde cinema\\" during a screening at a New York University class. Critic Peter Hajek wrote in the Austrian newspaper Kurier that \\"Valie Export presents this psychopanoptic view of the present in solid, striking images and often in unexpected humorous passages.\\" Critic Chris Holmlund, author of the scholarly article \\"Feminist Makeovers: The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich,\\" referred to Invisible Adversaries as a feminist version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, noted that the film includes references to famous paintings and to Un Chien Andalou, and wrote that therefore it \\"is visually rick, entertaining, striking, but also demanding.\\"Holmlund, Chris. \\"Feminist Makeovers: The Celluloid Surgery of Valie Export and Su Friedrich\\" (Chapter 14).

For example, London's Time Out wrote about the film that it is \\"[n]ot unlike W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism\\" and that it will \\"probably age as badly\\" and a reviewer for The Heights wrote that \\"I was expecting a great feminist work here, but got mediocrity. I cannot recommend that you see this film,\\" though he nevertheless praised the film as a \\"cornucopia of video spectacle [in which] Export delights, confounds and amuses the audience with her antics.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Unsichtbare Gegner at Valie Export's Official Website  *Invisible Adversaries at the TCM Movie Database *Unsichtbare Gegner at Film Portal Category:1970s avant-garde and experimental films Category:1977 independent films Category:1977 films Category:Austrian avant-garde and experimental films Category:Austrian drama films Category:Austrian films Category:Austrian independent films Category:Films about photographers Category:Films about sexuality Category:Films directed by Valie Export Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Films set in Vienna Category:German-language films Category:Austrian science fiction films Category:1977 directorial debut films ","title":"Invisible Adversaries"},{"id":"41632214","text":"Charles Parks (born 1946) is an American retired professional basketball player who spent one season in the American Basketball Association (ABA) as a member of the Denver Rockets (1968‚Äì69).

His freshman and sophomore years were spent at the junior varsity level, and El-Amin did not appear to have a chance at playing college basketball.

In 1888 Arnold founded together with Heinrich Dettmann the Russian-baltic electrotechnical factory (german ‚ÄúRussisch-baltische Elektrotechnische Fabrik‚Äù) to build electric generators.http://www.h-net.org/~business/bhcweb/publications/BEHprint/v026n2/p0540-p0549.pdf In 1886 he published his book ‚ÄûDie Ankerwicklungen und Ankerkonstruktionen der Gleichstrom-Dynamomaschinen‚Äú about electrical motors and generators (with focus on armature windings and the construction of armatures). Afterwards, in 1891, he replaced Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown as leading electrical engineer at Oerlikon. There he focused on the analysis and improvement of repulsion motors. 1892 Arnold got married with Helen Moll, daughter of his former professor Carl Ludwig Moll. They had a daughter together, who was born in 1899. In 1894 he was announced professor at the TH Karlsruhe. Between 1899 and 1904 he built the first electrotechnical laboratory. In cooperation with his assistant Jens Lassen La Cour, he published his book on alternating current machines (german ‚ÄûDie Wechselstromtechnik‚Äú), which includes five volumes. 1905 he was appointed Geheimer Hofrat and he received the honorary doctor degree from Leibniz University Hannover. In 1906/1907 Arnold was rector of the TH Karlsruhe. Before Arnold died on 16 November 1911, he offered a professorship to Rudolf Richter, who took Arnolds place as head of the electrotechnical institute in 1912.http://www.etit.kit.edu/rd_download/Engelbert_Arnold_und_Rudolf_Richter.pdf  Publications  * Die Ankerwicklungen der Gleichstrom-Dynamomaschinen : Entwicklung und Anwendung einer allgemein g√ºltigen Schaltungsregel, 1891.

Roosevelt's presidency began on March 4, 1933, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated as the 32nd President of the United States. During this period, he presented a series of initiatives to Congress designed to counter the effects of the Great Depression. He had signaled his intention to move with unprecedented speed to address the problems facing the nation in his inaugural address, declaring: \\"I am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require.\\" Roosevelt's specific priorities at the outset of his presidency were getting Americans back to work, protecting their savings and creating prosperity, providing relief for the sick and elderly, and getting industry and agriculture back on their feet. The 100th day of his presidency was June 11, 1933. Roosevelt coined the term \\"first 100 days\\" during a July 24, 1933, radio address. 13 major laws were enacted during this period. Since then, the first 100 days of a presidential term has taken on symbolic significance, and the period is considered a benchmark to measure the early success of a president. Background Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the first week of his Presidency dealing with a month-long series of bank closures that were ruining families nationwide. He closed the entire American banking system on March 6, 1933. On March 9, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act, which Roosevelt used to effectively create federal deposit insurance when the banks reopened. At 10 p.m. ET that Sunday night, on the eve of the end of the bank holiday, Roosevelt spoke to a radio audience of more than 60 million people, to tell them in clear language \\"what has been done in the last few days, why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be.\\" It was the first of 30 evening radio addresses that came to be called the Fireside Chats. The result, according to economic historian William L. Silber, was a \\"remarkable turnaround in the public's confidence ‚Ä¶ The contemporary press confirms that the public recognized the implicit guarantee and, as a result, believed that the reopened banks would be safe, as the President explained in his first Fireside Chat.\\" Within two weeks people returned more than half of the cash they had been hoarding, and the first stock-trading day after the bank holiday marked the largest-ever one-day percentage price increase.  The New Deal =Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA)= While Roosevelt's main goal was to increase employment, he also recognized the need for a support system for the poor. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration, started in 1933, addressed the urgent needs of the poor. It spent 500 million dollars on soup kitchens, blankets, employment schemes, and nursery schools. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration was shut down in 1935, and its work taken over by two completely new federal agencies, the Works Progress Administration and the Social Security Administration. FERA was involved with a broad range of projects, including construction, projects for professionals (e.g., writers, artists, actors, and musicians), and production of consumer goods. They also focused on giving food to the poor, educating workers, and providing nearly 500,000 jobs for women. =Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)= On March 9, 1933, Roosevelt ordered some of his senior staff to put unemployed men to work on conservation projects by summertime. On March 21, he submitted a proposal to Congress calling for the employment of 250,000 men by June. It was soon passed into law on March 31, giving the President authority to establish the Emergency Conservation Work (ECW) program. The ECW was the program's official name until 1937, when the popular name of CCC became official. Above and beyond other Hundred-Day programs, the CCC was Roosevelt's favorite creation, often called his \\"pet.\\" The Civilian Conservation Corps allowed unemployed men to work for six months on conservation projects such as planting trees, preventing soil erosion, and combating forest fires. Workers lived in militarized camps across the country and made $30 per month. By the end of the program in 1942, the CCC had employed 2.5 million men. =Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA)= In May 1933, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration was created in order to raise crop prices in response to the rural economic crisis. The administration helped to control the falling prices by setting quotas to reduce farm production. Beyond price adjustment, the act helped farmers to modernize and implement innovative farming methods. In extreme cases, the agency helped farmers with their mortgages and provided direct payment for farmers who would agree to sign acreage reduction contracts. =National Industry Recovery Act (NIRA)= The National Industry Recovery Act came into place on June 16, 1933, just five days after the end of 100 days. The act was an attempt to rebuild the economy from the severe deflation caused by the Great Depression. The act consists of two sections; the first promoted industrial recovery, and the second established the Public Works Administration (PWA). The National Industry Recovery Act set up the Public Works Administration (PWA) and the National Recovery Administration (NRA). The PWA used government money to build infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, for the state. This demand for construction created new jobs, which achieved Roosevelt's main priority. The National Recovery Act also improved working conditions and outlawed child labor. Wages increased, making it possible for workers to earn and spend more. =Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)= The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was established to build dams on the Tennessee River. These dams were designed to stimulate farming in the area while creating hydroelectricity, as well as prevent flooding and deforestation. The hydroelectric power was used effectively to provide electricity for nearby houses. The TVA marked the first time the federal government competed against private companies in the business of selling electricity.  Reception of the New Deal = Criticism = FDR's New Deal faced considerable opposition from both sides of the aisle. Democratic reformists felt the New Deal did not go far enough and Republicans felt that FDR was overstepping his authority. Roosevelt's biggest left-leaning critic was also his biggest political rival. Louisiana's Gov. Huey Long argued that the New Deal didn't go far enough. Long, positioning for his own prospective presidential run, had pushed expansive social programs and infrastructure investments in his state, and wanted to see FDR follow suit on a national level. Although some Democrats had turned on FDR due to the New Deal, the strongest opposition came from Republicans and the business sector. The most popular complaints were that the legislative package cost too much and that it overstepped the government's authority.
