He studied at the Surikov Moscow Art Institute, and after several years working as an artist in Moscow, his native city, he emigrated to the United States, eventually establishing his own gallery on the island of Maui in Hawaii. His oil paintings are also sold as gicl√©e prints which contributed to his popularity and led to the establishment of further galleries in Laguna Beach, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada. In 2011 Kush won the First Prize in Painting at the Artistes du Monde international exhibition in Cannes. Biography Kush was born in 1965 in Moscow, Russia. After studying at the Surikov Moscow Art Institute, he was conscripted into the Soviet Army for two years where he was assigned to paint murals. In 1987, he began exhibiting with the USSR Union of Artists but earned a living drawing portraits on the streets of Moscow and caricatures for a newspaper. In 1990, following his first foreign exhibition in Germany with two other Russian artists, he emigrated to the United States, initially living in Los Angeles before moving to Hawaii where he also worked as a mural painter for the Whaler's Village Museum on Maui.Thomas, Mary (29 March 1997). \\"Gallery Finds Russian Region Fertile Ground\\".

In 2019, Kush filed a lawsuit against pop singer Ariana Grande for copyright infringement when his paintings The Candle and The Candle 2 was used without permission in her music video God is a woman. The lawsuit is now settled. Style and works Kush predominantly works in the medium of oil painting on canvas or board, with many of the original paintings also sold as limited edition gicl√©e-on-canvas prints. His bronze-colored sculptures are small-scale and usually based on imagery from his paintings, such as Walnut of Eden and Pros and Cons. Although his style is frequently described as surrealist, Kush himself refers to it as \\"metaphorical realism\\" and cites the early influence on his style of Salvador Dal√≠'s surrealist paintings as well as landscapes by the German romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich.Smith, Craig (13 October 2006). \\"Something Once Known, Something Once Dreamed\\".

Another influence on his work has been the 16th century Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, known for his fantastic imagery and sometimes characterised as \\"the pre-Surrealism Surrealist\\". Wings, ships, and color-saturated seascapes are frequent themes in his paintings, exemplified in the companion pieces, Arrival of the Flower Ship and Departure of the Winged Ship.

He came to prominence in the 1980s thanks to the championship of art critic Norbert Lynton, and a cultural climate intent on re-assessing figurative art following the Royal Academy's ‚ÄòNew Spirit in Painting‚Äô exhibition in 1981. He started exhibiting at Nicola Jacob's gallery, moved to Fischer Fine Art in 1987 and finally to the Marlborough Gallery in 1990, by which time he had begun exhibiting internationally and had work in major public collections. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1991 and became Associate Artist at the National Gallery 1991-93. His 30-year teaching career at Chelsea School of Art and the Royal College influenced a generation of students. Despite his success, Kiff's position was never a comfortable one. His commitment to the pictorial values of modernism, his deep respect for artists such as Klee, Miro or Marc Chagall, and his ideas about painting were often at odds with prevailing assumptions. In contemporary debates around abstraction versus figuration he tended to push past the battle-lines: ‚Äòcolour thinking‚Äô as opposed to ‚Äòimage thinking‚Äô, pictorial form versus representational meaning, in order to get at something beneath their seeming differences. Images themselves arose out of the stuff of painting and an intimate relationship with a technique. His deep personal knowledge of poetry and music informed his sense of a painting's structure. He saw colour in terms of images and images in terms of colour, which constituted, as he saw it, ‚Äúthe natural complexity of painting‚Äù. Colour and colour relationships interacted in his paintings with a range of images evoking the blissfully radiant and lyrical to the comic and disturbingly grotesque. ‚ÄòFantasy‚Äô as he saw it ‚Äòwas a way of thinking about reality‚Äô. The matter-of-fact imagery of streets, houses, trees, animals and people was configured with dreamlike encounters and happenings in a way that invited the viewer into an internal world constantly using the external world as its subject-matter. ‚ÄòThe Sequence‚Äô begun in the 1970s, and by the time of his death, constituting nearly 200 works represented a striking formal innovation. Regarded by Kiff as a single work, it was a series of pictures (acrylic on paper), forming a chain, repeating and developing imagery and colour, and allowing their networks of association to move and develop laterally across many formats, with a single energy carrying them along. By the late 1980s his range of media had expanded to include woodcuts, monotypes, lithography and etching.

It is endemic to Papua New Guinea where it is found in the southern Owen Stanley Range and the Pini Range in the eastern New Guinea as well as in the D'Entrecasteaux Islands (Fergusson, Goodenough, and Normanby islands). The specific name waliesa is derived from the Dobu word waliesa that means \\"namesake\\", in honor of Fred Malesa from Fergusson Island. He had greatly assisted the describers of this species during their expedition in the Milne Bay Province. Description Adult males grow to and adult females to in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is acutely pointed in dorsal view and but truncated with the lower half recessed when viewed laterally. The tympanum is distinct. The fingers have no webbing but have flattened and expanded tips. The toes are almost completely webbed and have pointed tips bearing discs. The dorsum and legs are densely covered by conical asperities. There is a thick dorso-lateral ridge running from the eye backward. The dorsum is olive green and is freckled with darker olive flecks. The sides have dark flecks that contrast with the yellow background; the yellow color gets more dominating the lower down. The chin and throat are white some high-contrast mottling or clouding of melanin, except for the vocal sac in males that is heavily stippled with melanin. A tadpole at Gosner stage 34 measures in total length. The male advertisement call consists of 3‚Äì8 somewhat \\"raspy\\" nasal notes, emitted at a mean rate of about four notes per second. Habitat and conservation Papurana waliesa is an uncommon species associated with slow- and faster-flowing streams, ditches, and Pandanus swamps, in disturbed grassy habitats and villages. It is found up to above sea level. Papurana waliesa can adapt to certain anthropogenic habitats, but it has a small range and is found in low numbers. Moreover, it is restricted to elevations that are under moderate to heavy human disturbance. It has therefore been assessed as \\"vulnerable\\".

As of May 2010 the partnership ended and the company began manufacturing bicycles under the KOGA brand. at koga.com  History  The company was founded by Andries Gaastra in 1974, who had left his function at his father's company Batavus. The name Koga is a combination of his surname and that of his wife Marion Kowallik. The addition of Miyata came from the cooperation with Japanese manufacturer Miyata. Koga Miyata relied on Japanese components from manufacturers such as Shimano. From 1980 Koga Miyata sponsored the IJsboerke cycle team whose member, the Dutch Peter Winnen, won a stage in the Tour de France at the Alpe d'Huez soon after, leading to wider recognition. In 1992, Gaastra sold his company to the Atag Cycle Group, which had acquired Batavus six years earlier. KOGA is now owned by the Accell Group.  Products  Koga Miyata started with the use of Japanese components. The design and assemblage of the bicycles was done by hand in the Netherlands. At first Koga Miyata only produced racing bicycles. In 1976 they added a range of randonneurs or touring bicycles, and in 1986 mountain bikes. In 1993, after it was acquired by the Atag Cycle Group, Koga Miyata also produced hybrid bicycles.

The stone temple should have been built during the reign of Parantaka Chola I, which is evident from the inscriptions found in the temple. There are also inscriptions from the period of Sundara Chola, Adiya Karikalan and Raja Raja Chola I. According to historian Harle, the temple is counted among the four early extant temples of the Chola Empire, with the other three being Koranganatha Temple in Tiruchirappalli district, Moovar Koil in Pudukottai district and Nageswaran temple at Kumbakonam These temples follow the Pallava architecture which are relatively small in size. They all have a fair-sized porch, locally called ardhamandapa attached to the sanctum, both of which are slightly below the ground level in a pit kind of structure. The structures are also predominantly built of stone.Harle 1958, p. 9 The garbhagriha(sanctum) and the arthamandapa(secluded hall) of the temple belong to the earlier structure, while there have been newer structures added to it lately. All the parivara(consort) shrines of the earlier period have not survived and few newer shrines have come up. The sculptures of this temple is highly acclaimed for its beauty. Apart from the lovely devakoshta(divine) images of Dakshinamurthy, Lingodhbhavar, Brahma and Durga, the vimana(shrine) too houses exquisite images of Vishnu, Narashima, Tripurantaka. The temple has series of miniature panels depicting scenes from Ramayana.

The episode premiered in the United States on NBC on September 14, 2011. The episode was written by series creator Emily Spivey and was directed by James Griffiths. \\"Pilot\\" introduces each of the main characters, as well as establishes the basic premises of the series. In the episode, Reagan (Christina Applegate) decides to return to work after giving birth to her baby with the support of her stay-at-home husband Chris (Will Arnett). Once she returns to work, Regan must deal with the endless needs of her friend and boss, Ava (Maya Rudolph) the host of her own talk show, that Regan works as a producer on. \\"Pilot\\" debuted Up All Night, in a special timeslot between America's Got Talent and the short-lived NBC series, Free Agents at 10:00 p.m. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode received 10.95 million viewers and received a 3.7 rating/10% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, ranking first in its timeslot. It currently ranks as the highest-rated episode of the series. The episode also received mostly positive reviews from critics. Plot After giving birth to her baby, Reagan (Christina Applegate) decides to return to work with the support of her stay-at-home husband Chris (Will Arnett). Once she returns to work, Regan must deal with the endless needs of her friend and boss, Ava (Maya Rudolph) the host of her own talk show, that Regan works as a producer on. Production \\"Pilot\\" was written by series creator Emily Spivey and was directed by James Griffiths. The series was based on creator Spivey's life when she went back to working on Saturday Night Live after giving birth to a baby boy. Due to the nature of her job, she was required to take care of the baby and work late nights. She decided she wanted to make a show based on those extremes. On February 1, 2011, Up all Night received a pilot order. Applegate was the first cast member signed on to the series. She is credited as a producer for the series. Rudolph was the second main cast member to sign on to the series. Rudolph had previously worked with the series creator on SNL and Spivey had wanted to work with Rudolph before the series plot was established. Arnett was the third main cast member to sign on to the series. The series was officially picked up for 13 episodes on May 15, 2011. After the success of Maya Rudolph's movie Bridesmaids, Up All Night went through some retooling which now has her character Ava, as a talk-show host, and Reagan now as the show's producer, instead of them being PR executives. This led to Rudolph's character being compared to Rudolph's impression of Oprah on Saturday Night Live. Reception =Ratings= The pilot was first shown on September 14, 2011, in the United States on NBC. It was shown between America's Got Talent and the short-lived NBC series, Free Agents. In its original American broadcast, the pilot was viewed by an estimated 10.950 million viewers and received a 3.7 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This means that it was seen by 3.7% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode ranked first in its timeslot beating CBS series Big Brother which received a 2.9 rating/8% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and ABC series Nightline which received a 1.2 rating/3% share in the demo. Despite the good ratings for the premiere, the series had a large drop at the 15-minute mark dropping from a 4.2 rating to a 3.3 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Reviews= \\"Pilot\\" received mostly positive reviews. The success of the pilot led to the series holding a rating of 64/100 on Metacritic from 25 reviews. The A.V. Club reviewer Erik Adams called the episode \\"one of the funniest pilots of the new fall season\\" commenting that \\"Showrunner Emily Spivey does well not to mine the saccharine elements of parenthood. She makes Up All Night‚Äôs intentions apparent from the moment that Arnett and Applegate can‚Äôt bring themselves to quit cursing in front of lil‚Äô Amy.\\" Another A.V. Club reviewer Emily VanDerWerff was slightly more negative towards the pilot writing that \\"The pilot for Up All Night isn‚Äôt very funny, especially given the people working on it, but it‚Äôs often well-observed.\\". Her main criticism was that the series was \\"essentially, two shows in one\\" calling the workplace scenes \\"like a copy of many other shows on the air\\". The two reviewers eventually gave the series a B. HitFix reviewer Daniel Feinberg gave the series pilot a positive review, but disliked the office settings and the writing for Rudolph's character commenting that \\"Will Arnett and Christina Applegate are playing parents, but Maya Rudolph is playing a sitcom character\\". He ultimately gave the series a B- rating the Baby Scenes with a B+ and the Rudolph scenes a C/C-.

Carrol Naish. It tells the story of the daughter of a general who goes to look for her father after he disappears. The film received mixed reviews and was the last that Wong made for Paramount Pictures. Plot Kim Ling (Anna May Wong), the daughter of a general accused of embezzling $300,000 of government money, investigates his disappearance. She eventually discovers a labor camp run by Gregory Prin (J. Carrol Naish) north of Singapore. There she meets Chang Tai (Anthony Quinn), who is undercover investigating Prin's activities. Together they manage to discover Ling's father and the money, as well as identify several known fugitives. After the arrival of Tex Ballister (Broderick Crawford), who reveals Tai's true identity and attempts to blackmail Prin, a local rebellion ignites. This allows Ling, her father, and Tai to escape.

Ahn Ling *Philip Ahn as Sam Ring (uncredited) Production Island of Lost Men was filmed in early 1939. Production was delayed by cost overruns of approximately $25,000. Among the most expensive scenes were those involving the jungle and the river scene. Wong's salary was $6000 with another $1000 paid for overtime, while Quinn only earned $750. The original title for the film was Guns for China. However, the U.S. State Department implored studios to avoid referencing or alluding to the then-ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War. After discussion with its sales manager in Japan, Paramount Pictures changed the title to Island of Lost Men. Wong sang \\"Music on the Shore\\", composed by Friedrich Hollaender and Frank Loesser. The song was written especially for her. Release Island of Lost Men was Wong's last film for Paramount Island of Lost Men received its American release on August 16, 1939. Critical reception was mixed. Variety praised the general production, acting (especially Wong's), and sets; however, it considered the plot to be \\"trite\\". The Daily Variety noted that Wong's singing was \\"pleasing\\". The English magazine Kinetographic Weekly was dismissive of the film, but appreciative of Wong's acting. Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote that the \\"kindliest\\" thing one could say about the movie is that Naish is in it, \\"only this time with a slant to Mr. Naish's villainous eyes\\", and that the jungle setting was so unbelievable that it implied that \\"if the camera were swung no more than a frame or so to either side it would reveal a filling station, or a roadside food dispensary in the shape of a hot dog\\". Island of Lost Men proved to be Wong's last film with Paramount. The studio did not renew her contract afterwards, possibly because of the budget overruns in Island.

By convention all lawyers admitted to practice in Ghana become automatic members of the association. The first president of the Ghanaian Bar was Sierra Leonean lawyer Frans Dove.Audrey Gadzekpo, \\"Dove-danquah, Mabel (1905‚Äì84)\\", in Eugene Benson, L. W. Conolly (eds), Encyclopedia of Post-Colonial Literatures in English (1994), 2nd edition, Routledge, 2005, p. 341. History and membership The British parliament established the Supreme Court of Judicature for the Gold Coast Colony in 1876, with a Chief Justice and no more than four Puisne Justices. John Mensah Sarbah was the first native of Ghana to be called to the bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1887. The legal system was based on that of England, in which solicitors provide legal advice and prepare legal documents while barristers act as advocates in court. However, this division was not observed in practice in Ghana, and in 1960 an act abolished the distinction. Until the Ghana School of Law was established in 1958, all lawyers were trained abroad, almost always at the Inns of Court in England. As of 2011 there are about 2,500 practicing lawyers, although not all have registered as members of the Bar Association.

Controversy In October 2010 then GBA Vice President, Mr. Justice Kusi-Minkah Premo, called on the Chief Justice and the Council to eliminate inconsistency, corruption and misconduct by judges. In April 2011 then National President Frank W. K. Beecham spoke in defence of Mr Justice E. K. Ayebi, a judge who had come under attack after acquitting 14 defendants in a murder trial. In July 2011 four lawyers made allegations of widespread corruption among judges. The GBA condemned the four for making unsubstantiated claims, and asked them to name the judges. Another lawyer openly confessed to having bribed a judge. The GBA said it would take legal steps to prosecute him. The four lawyers were blacklisted by the Association of Magistrates and Judges. They and others stated that they were considering forming an alternative Association. The Ghana Bar Association held its annual general meeting in Cape Coast in September 2011, soon after two magistrates had been sacked for demanding bribes. Then GBA President Frank Beecham said the association would fight corruption in all its forms. The GBA would establish a complaints unit to take complaints about corruption and ensure that offenders were prosecuted.

His early works were often retouched by Giordano to such a degree that some of them were confused with those of the master. He learned Giordano‚Äôs art so well that when the master left Naples for the Spanish court in 1692, he was assigned the task of completing the unfinished Neapolitan works for delivery to clients. Reliable details of his own production are available as from 1686, when he received the final payment for a painting of Holy Martyrs for the Jesuit college in Trapani. His most celebrated works are the series of 28 paintings for the Church of the Annunziata in Aversa, produced between 1702 and 1703 together with his brother Gennaro.

Biography  At the age of sixteen, Willy Ostijn entered the [Institut Lemmens] of Malines to study the piano with Marinus de Jong and the organ with Flor Peeters. He got a pedagogical diploma at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent, and first prizes of counterpoint, piano, chamber music and composition. Willy Ostijn becomes the second organist of the St Rumoldus‚Äô Cathedral of Malines. From 1938 until his retirement, he was also a professor of musical education at the Royal Atheneum of R≈ìselare, a function that did not prevent him from giving lectures at the Music Academy of Izegem from 1939 to 1949. Before the Second World War, Ostijn had a reputation with the Trio Willy Ostijn which played the great works of the repertory and Ostijn‚Äôs own compositions. Between 1950 and 1960 his symphonic music and concertante pieces, written in a romantic style, were performed by many orchestras in Belgium and broadcast abroad. Conductors Paul Doulliez, Leonce Graz, Ernest Maes, Fernand Terby and Jozef Verhelst were the most active ones to publicize his works. From 1960, the disinterest of the audience towards \\"light music\\" and (neoclassical style) caused the decline of Ostijn‚Äôs career. The reorganization of public broadcasting in Belgium in 1961 meant that his works were no longer broadcast. Thereafter, Ostijn devoted himself mainly to chamber music and choral music. Far from seeking originality at all costs, Willy Ostijn gives his audience a chance to have a good time with a man of taste. Ostijn said: ‚ÄúBoth in terms of technique and of vision, I have always remained faithful to the romantic tradition that sees music as a spontaneous and logical development of lyrical themes through classical harmony and rich, varying orchestration‚Äù.\\"Willy Ostijn : 1913-1993\\", Short Biography by Peter Malisse, in the New Music Centre site Between 1945 and 1955 he specialized in brilliant works (rhapsody, overture, concert piece, symphonic poem), often descriptive : \\"Spaanse balletsuite\\" (\\"Spanish ballet suite\\"), \\"Beelden uit Broadway\\" (\\"Images from Broadway\\"), \\"Marokkaanse Suite\\" (\\"Moroccan Suite\\"), \\"Ijslandvaarders\\" (\\"Icelandic seafarers\\"), \\"Beelden uit het Oosten\\" (\\"Images from the Orient\\"), or both \\"concertst√ºck for piano and orchestra\\" and \\"concertst√ºck for piano and strings\\". His symphonic work is close to the Belgian Arthur Meulemans, the French Maurice Thiriet, the English Haydn Wood and the American Ferde Grof√©.

The first version, developed in 1981 for the VIC-20 and Commodore PET, is the first Llamasoft game ever produced . Gameplay The gameplay in all versions follows the same basic mechanic. A ball bounces around the screen, moving in cardinal directions only and bouncing off at 180 degrees when it strikes the side of the screen. By pressing a key (or moving the joystick or touching the touchscreen), the player can cause a paddle to appear at the ball's current location, making the ball immediately bounce off the paddle and turn either left or right. Once placed, a paddle remains on screen, forcing the ball into more and more complex bouncing patterns. In addition, whenever the ball strikes a paddle, the paddle's direction is reversed. The objective of the game is to guide the ball to touch a randomly placed target that appears on screen. When the target is touched, score is awarded and a new target is placed, although all existing paddles remain. The player loses the game if a target is not touched within a time limit. Versions The original PET/VIC-20/ZX81 version displayed one target at a time and had only a single level which ran forever. The game was played entirely for score. A Commodore 64 version of Deflex called Made In France (because the programmer was actually in France at the time he programmed that part of the game) was posted as a free download to the Compunet service. The gameplay was the same as the original version. This was also included as an easter egg in the game Iridis Alpha, where it identified itself only as \\"MIF BY YAK\\". A version for the Pocket PC platform - again called only Deflex - was later released and ported to Windows. This version had a more modern structure in which the game was divided into levels with each level having a pre-determined layout of multiple targets and sometimes pre-placed walls. The player was required to collect all targets on the level within the time limit, but had multiple lives which allowed them to try again from the same level. This version also introduced hazardous objects which instantly cost the player a life if the ball touches them, with the message \\"You clumsy donkey!\\" The most recently released version is for iOS, and runs on both the iPhone and iPad platforms with similar features. This follows the same level-based structure as the PC version, but the time limit returns to being between collection of individual targets rather than for the whole level, and touching a hazardous object deducts an amount of time rather than instantly losing the level. Placing paddles also deducts a small amount of time. Lives are removed, because this version allows any previously reached level to be played on demand. This version also added a \\"combo\\" system whereby the ball may be precisely placed to touch multiple targets at the same time; doing this multiple times in series awards additional points. This version also has a distinctive soundtrack composed of piano chords and arpeggios that trigger on events in the game, and commentary by a voice-over reminiscent of Fluttershy from My Little Pony.

Executives =Executives= Five executives lead the GOA. It is headed by the late Dr Julius Darko as President of GOA, then subsequently Dr.Samuel O.Asiedu. Dr Remi Ninkpe is the current president. Activities The association in 2009 passed a resolution mandating all optometrists wanting to be members to write a professional exam. Upon successfully passing the exam, the certification required to practice optometry in Ghana is awarded. The group has about 200 members. In 2010 the Ghana Optometric Association along with the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology's Faculty of Distance Learning rolled out a two-year program to offer all members of GOA who did not have the Doctor of Optometry degree to enroll for it. The aim of the programme is to ensure that by the end of 2012 all optometrists in Ghana will have the O.D degree as is required under the Ministry of Health. This was successfully accomplished. As such, the OD certificate in OPTOMETRY, is the only recognised for practise in GHANA. The GOA has grown since its inception. Apart from regulating the activities of optometrists countrywide, it also looks out for the well being of its members in ways such as: *Organizing continuing education programmes for optometrists *Advocating for better terms of service from the Ministry of Health *Partnering international bodies to promote eye care in Ghana GOA collaborations One of the major achievements of GOA was hosting the World Council of Optometry (WCO) General Delegates meeting in Accra from 6 to 10 April 2005. It was the first time the meeting was held in Africa. The Ghana Optometric Association did so in collaboration with the Africa Council of Optometry with sponsorship from Essilor International. It was attended by about 200 delegates from the council.

Background  Ghadames, an oasis town with a population of around 10,000, lies surrounded by desert in a corner of western Libya, bordering both Algeria and Tunisia. The city is home to one of five UNESCO World Heritage sites in Libya, which UNESCO officials feared would be endangered by fighting. Throughout much of the conflict, Ghadames remained isolated and cut off from communications. As such, news from the town was scant and control of the town was not easy to discern. Some reports said that Ghadames remained \\"under siege\\" by loyalists for months; however, when anti-Gaddafi forces retook the town in late August, these reports were shown to be outdated. After the war, National Geographic reported that rebels had indeed staged an uprising in the town, but that a loyalist Tuareg militia suppressed it at some point.  Raid  After apparently filtering across the Libya-Algeria border in cars for several days, loyalist forces launched an attack on NTC forces in the city of Ghadames on 24 September. The raid began at around 5:30 AM as group of around 100 loyalists, allegedly including mercenaries from Algeria and groups of Tuareg, entered the city and began attacking NTC positions. Local pro-Gaddafi sleeper cells were also reported by local officials to have joined in on the raid. Anti-Gaddafi forces lost 6-8 fighters and suffered more than 60 wounded before driving loyalists back into the desert. Sporadic shelling of the town by loyalists continued after the raid, and anti-Gaddafi forces continued to engage in clashes with loyalists as they pursued them out of the town. By the next day, the town was once again clear, but NTC forces had increased security, setting up new checkpoints and posting snipers at key locations. Colonel Ahmed Bani, an NTC spokesman, said that he expected that loyalists would continue to try to use the vast desert area outside of Ghadames as a base of operations, but that anti-Gaddafi forces had secured the area and would not allow another attack. During the night, another series of clashes erupted which continued into the morning of 26 September, leaving another three rebels dead and a dozen wounded.

It is the first platform game from Llamasoft. According to Minter, the three main influences were Canyon Climber and Miner 2049er for the Atari 8-bit family and a homebrew Atari 2600 game called Man Goes Down. It is the Minotaur Project game representing the Sinclair Spectrum. Gameplay The goat uses her kids to destroy an ox while a billy goat waits above. The player controls a goat which can move from left to right, and jump upwards, on a series of vertically scrolling platforms. The vertical scroll continues at a fixed rate regardless of the goat's position; if the goat falls or is scrolled off the bottom of the screen, the game ends immediately. Each platform is covered with grass; moving left or right on a platform causes the goat to eat the grass, scoring points and causing further score bonus objects to appear on the platform, which can be collected by moving over them. No points are scored for merely jumping upwards, meaning the player must balance the need to escape from the edge of the scroll with the need to remain where they are to collect points. Billy goats appear on certain platforms. Touching one of these causes an explosion of hearts to appear. After this point, once a certain amount of grass has been eaten, a kid will spawn which follows behind the player's goat (the player's goat is, therefore, a nanny goat--and is acknowledged as such by Llamasoft--in spite of many reviews referring to the player's goat as \\"he\\"). Multiple kids form a trail which extends behind the player's goat as it moves. Kids are not negatively affected by being scrolled off the screen. They cannot eat grass, but they can collect the scoring items and power-ups revealed by doing so. The number of kids the player has acts as a multiplier for the score value of grass and items. Later platforms include hostile enemies. If the player's goat touches one of these, the goat is forced into an uncontrolled jump and a kid is lost. If the player has no kids, the uncontrolled jump is the only penalty, although this may cause the goat to fall off the bottom of the screen and the game to end. However, if the player can arrange for the trail of kids to touch an enemy without the nanny goat doing so, the enemy is destroyed, giving a score bonus. =Controls= GoatUp can be controlled using the touch screen or the tilt sensor. The tilt sensor is the default on iPhone, and the touch screen the default on iPad; there is no other difference between the platform. GoatUp also supports the iCade.  Reviews  GoatUp has received positive ratings from Pocket Gamer and TouchGen. It was awarded Gaming App of the Day on Kotaku. As of Jan 2012 it has a MetaCritic score of 80.

Lipkin is renowned as a literary translator and often worked from the regional languages which Stalin tried to obliterate. Lipkin hid a typescript of his friend Vasily Grossman's magnum opus, Life and Fate, from the KGB and initiated the process that brought it to the West. Martin Amis remarked, \\"If it were for nothing else than the part he played in bringing Life and Fate to publication Semyon Izrailevich Lipkin would deserve to be remembered.\\" Lipkin's importance as a poet was achieved once his work became available to the general reading public after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the many years prior, he was sustained by the support of his wife, poet Inna Lisnianskaya and close friends such as Anna Akhmatova, Joseph Brodsky and Alexander Solzhenitsyn (who thought him a genius and championed his poetry). Lipkin's verse includes explorations of history and philosophy, and exhibits a keen sense of peoples' diverse destinies. His poems include references to his Jewish heritage and to the Bible. They also draw on a first-hand awareness of the tragedies of Stalin's Great Purge and World War II. Lipkin's long-standing inner opposition to the Soviet regime surfaced in 1979-80, when he contributed to the uncensored almanac \\"Metropol\\"; he and Lisnianskaya then left the ranks of the official Writer's Union of the USSR.  Early years  Lipkin was born in Odessa, the child of Israel and Rosalia Lipkin. Semyon Lipkin was of Jewish ethnicity.https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315706474/chapters/10.4324/9781315706474-99 His father had a tailoring business. His early education was disrupted by the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and by the 1918-20 Civil War. Lipkin spent a lot of time reading and educating himself at home. In 1929 he left Odessa for Moscow, where he studied engineering and economics and graduated from the Moscow Engineering-Economic Institute in 1937. While studying there, he had begun to teach himself Persian followed by the other languages of the oriental regions, which were disappearing as a result of Russification, including Northeast Caucasian languages, Kalmyk, Kirghiz, Kazakh, Tatar, Tajik and Uzbek, together with their histories and cultures.  Military career  Lipkin's military career started with the German invasion in June 1941, when he enlisted as a war correspondent with the military rank of senior lieutenant, at the Baltic Fleet base in Kronstadt near Leningrad. Later he was transferred to the 110th Kalmyk cavalry division (with which he got into the German encirclement), and then to the Volga river flotilla at Stalingrad. He took part in the victorious Battle of Stalingrad in 1942-43 and covered its events as a journalist. Lipkin was awarded 4 military orders and a number of medals.  Literary career  Lipkin published his first poem when he was aged 15 and Eduard Bagritsky recognised its merit. It was not until he entered his sixth decade that the regime permitted him to publish his own poetic work, and until his seventh decade for a recognition of his status as a poet to fully develop, despite the fact that Anna Akhmatova and Joseph Brodsky (the Nobel laureate) amongst others in his immediate circle, acknowledged the greatness of his poems. Having met in the 1930s the 20th century Russian poets Osip Mandelstam, Anna Akhmatova and Marina Tsvetayeva, along with the prose writers Vasily Grossman and Andrey Platonov, Lipkin later provided a masterly description of them in his memoir Kvadriga. His extensive oeuvre of translation won many accolades. For his translations and literary work Lipkin was honoured with the title of Kalmykia national poet (1967) and later, Hero of Kalmykia (2001), People's Artist of Kabardino-Balkaria (1957), Outstanding Cultural Worker of the Uzbek Republic (1968), Rudaki State Prize of Tajik Republic (1967), Tukay State Prize of Tatarstan (1992), Andrey Sakharov \\"Courage in the Literature\\" Prize (1992), literary prizes of the magazines Ogoniok (1989) and \\"Luchnik (Archer)\\" (1994), and The Pushkin Prize of the Alfred Topfer Foundation (1995). = Poetry = * Ochevidets [Eyewitness: poems of various years].

Semyon Lipkin saved a copy of his friend's typescript in a bag hanging under some coats on a peg at his dacha at Peredelkino and later moved it to Elena Makarova and Sergei Makarov's attic in Khimki near Moscow for safe keeping. (Elena Makarova was the Lipkin's step-daughter, the daughter of his widow the poet Inna Lisnianskaya. Sergei Makarov is Elena's husband.) In 1975 Lipkin asked the writer Vladimir Voinovich and Academician Andrey Sakharov to help to smuggle the manuscript from the USSR and get it published in the West, which eventually happened in 1980. In July 2013, Grossman's own manuscript and other papers confiscated by the KGB in 1961 were finally released from detention and passed by the FSB secret service (former KGB) to the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI).  Chronology of historical events impacting Lipkin and his writing  * In 1931 Stalin ordered enforced collectivization, closed the Kalmyk Buddhist monasteries and burnt religious texts. * In 1932 Mayakovsky committed suicide, the independent literary groups were closed, and the Union of Soviet Writers was formed. In 1932-34 between three and five million peasants died in the Terror Famine in the Ukraine. * In 1936 Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk was denounced by the authorities and approximately half the members of the Soviet political, military and intellectual elite were imprisoned or shot, as were around 250,000 members of the various national minorities whose epics Lipkin translated to Russian or about whom he wrote poems. This period was known as the Great Terror or \\"Yezhovshchina\\" - after the Soviet secret police, the N.K.V.D.'s head Nikolay Yezhov. * In 1937 Lipkin graduated from the Moscow Economics Engineering Institute. While studying engineering he had begun studying Persian, followed by the other oriental languages including Dagestani, Kalmyk, Kirghiz, Tatar, Tadjik, Uzbek, Kabardinian and others. * In 1939 the Molotov‚ÄîRibbentrop Pact was signed, the Second World War began and 70,000 mentally handicapped Germans were euthanased by their government. * In 1941 Germany invaded the Soviet Union until 1945. * Lipkin fought in the Red Army as a war correspondent, including at Stalingrad. * In December 1942 the Soviets reconquered the Kalmyk ASSR and went on to win a decisive victory at the Battle of Kursk in August 1943, after which Stalin declared all Kalmyks to be Nazi collaborators and deported the entire population of the Kalmyk ASSR, including communists, to prison camps in Siberia and Central Asia in December 1943. * In 1941 - 1944 about two million Jews were killed in western areas of the Soviet Union and two and a half million Polish Jews were gassed at Chelmno, Majdanek, Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka and Auschwitz. * On January 27, 1944 the Siege of Stalingrad was lifted, between April and June 436,000 Hungarian Jews were gassed at Auschwitz in fifty-six days; between August and October the Warsaw uprising occurred. * On January 27, 1945 Auschwitz was liberated, on May 9 Germany surrendered. * The Nuremberg trials were held in 1946 and while the Nazi leadership were judged Andrey Zhdanov tightened control over the arts in the USSR.

On March 5 Stalin died and on 4 April there was Official acknowledgment that the case against the Jewish doctors was fabricated. * In February 1956 the period known as \\"The Thaw\\" peaked, in February Khrushchev made his Secret Speech to the Communist Party, denouncing the forcible exile of the Kalmyks, Karachai, Chechen, Ingush, and Balkhars Kabardins. Millions of prisoners were released from the camps. But from October to November the Hungarian insurrection was suppressed. * In 1957 some Kalmyks were allowed to return to their native land. * In July 1958, the former Kalmyk ASSR reconstituted, Doctor Zhivago was published abroad, Pasternak declined the Nobel prize under pressure from the authorities. * In 1961 Lipkin's friend, Vasily Grossman's novel Life and Fate was submitted for publication and rejected by the Communist party officials; the KGB raided Grossman's home and seized all the copies they could. Lipkin preserved a copy and clandestinely passed it to the West, where it was eventually published. * In November 1962 Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was published in the Soviet Union. * In 1964 Khrushchev fell and Vasily Grossman died believing Life and Fate would never be published. Sinyavski and Daniel were tried in 1966. * In 1967 Lipkin received the Rudaki State Prize of the Tadzhik SSR and his first collection of poetry Ochevidets, (Eyewitness) was published. His poem 'Conjunction' was read as coded support for Israel. * In August 1968 the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia took place. * In 1968 Lipkin was made the People's Poet of the Kalmyk ASSR. * In 1970 the first issue of the Jewish samizdat journal \\"Exodus\\" was published, as was Lipkin's second collection, A Notebook of Being. * In 1971 Jewish emigration began to be permitted.

Sakharov was internally exiled by the authorities. Grossman's Life and Fate was finally published in Switzerland, from pages preserved by Lipkin and microfilmed by Sakharov. In 1981 \\"Metropol\\" was published in the United States. Lipkin's Volya (variously called Will, Free Will, and Freedom) was published in the U.S. edited by Joseph Brodsky. * In 1982 Brezhnev died. * In (1984)Andropov died and Lipkin's Kochevoi Ogon' (A Nomadic Flame) was published in the U.S. * In 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and perestroika began. * In 1986 Lipkin's Kartiny i golosa (Pictures and Voices) was published in London and Lipkin was reinstated into the Writers‚Äô Union. * In 1988 Gorbachev became president.

The marshes are located at an altitude of about 3,600 meters above sea level and cover an area of about 2,600 square kilometers. To east, they are bordered by the Min Mountains and to the west by the Amne Machin mountain range. Geology The marshes can be divided into four geomorphological regions: the Zoig√™ plateau plain, the Hong Yuan plateau mound, the A Ba plateau mountain, and the Songpan-Lixan Alp. The soil of the marshes contains a layer of peat that is about 2 to 3 meters thick in most places, but can reach up to 7 meters in thickness. History Yak graze on the Zoig√™ Grassland. The Long March passed through the Zoig√™ Marsh in August 1935. The marshes were partially drained for grazing of cattle, sheep, and horses in the 1970s. This involved digging 200 km of ditches to drain 1,400 km2 of marshland. The project continued until the 1990s and exacerbated desertification problems. Herders reported that gold miners have also used cloud-seeding cannons to prevent rainfall, which has caused die-offs in vegetation. In 1994, a nature preserve was established in the marshes. From 2010, community efforts to replant local grasses have been underway, with light grazing by yak allowed, so that the animals can tread the seeds down and stimulate regrowth.

Background In 1887 Emma Bradley, a seven-year-old child, fell ill with encephalitis. Unlike most victims of the disease, she had access to the finest care of that era. Her father had assisted Alexander Graham Bell in the marketing of the telephone and had invested wisely. George and Helen Bradley were able to convert their estate in Pomfret, Connecticut into a hospital with a full-time doctor, nurses and other staff. They were unstinting in their efforts to obtain the finest advice and recommendations from major medical centers. Their efforts were in vain when at the age of 27, physically and mentally devastated by the disease, Emma Bradley died. Following the death of their only child, it was the family‚Äôs hope that future children might be helped. In 1932, following the provisions of their will, the nation‚Äôs first children‚Äôs psychiatric hospital was opened in East Providence, Rhode Island.Online Pamphlet - History of Bradley Hospital , retrieved 09-27-2011 Discovery Charles Bradley was the great nephew of George Bradley. As a pediatrician who had studied neurology during his residency at Babies Hospital in New York, he became the second director of the hospital. He conducted extensive neurological workups on the patients at the facility. Included in the workup was pneumoencephalography, a study which often led to severe headaches which Dr. Bradley assumed resulted from the loss of spinal fluid. In an attempt to stimulate the choroid plexus to produce spinal fluid he prescribed Benzedrine. It was noted by the teachers and nurses that cared for the children that the patients who had received Benzedrine showed an improvement both in behavior and in academic performance. This was apparent even to the children, who began to call the medication ‚Äúarithmetic pills‚Äù as a result of the improvement in their studies.Cosmos Club Journal 2001 , retrieved 09-27-2011 Following these events Dr. Bradley published several works regarding the behavioral effects of Benzedrine.Bradley, Am J Psychiatry. 1937; 94: 577-585Jule Eisenbud, Review of Bradley's Schizophrenia in Childhood, Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 10 (1941) :482-483 However, over 25 years passed before this class of drugs came into favor for the treatment of behavior problems in children. Other contributions Dr Bradley was also credited with the invention of a device to make pneumoencephalography in children easier and wrote widely on childhood schizophrenia. He was also a leader in the use of residential treatment for children with behavioral problems.

Biography He was born in Saluzzo in the Province of Cuneo, Italy, to an author of agricultural texts. After studying briefly under Andrea Gastaldi at the Accademia Albertina in Turin, Giacomo Gandi continued his formation independently by making trips to Florence, Rome ‚Äì where he settled around 1869 ‚Äì and Parma. He appears to have prided himself in never setting foot in the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, instead training with a painter by the surname Gigi.

Turin, 1893, page 442-444. Moving to Savigliano after 1874, he specialised in genre painting and watercolour in which he executed two works for the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris. He participated in the national exhibitions in Milan in 1872, Turin in 1880 and 1884, Milan in 1881 and, two years later in the Rome Esposizione di Belle Arti. He also took part in the shows organised by the Societ√† Promotrice di Belle Arti di Torino from 1870 to 1896, as well as those in Genoa, Florence and Naples. The great success of his painting inspired by the life of the common people began to decline towards the end of the 19th century due to the changing tastes of collectors.

The company was founded in 1983 and initially intended to operate the aircraft to apply dispersants on oil spills at sea, as a part of the national oil spill defense system. However, due to oil companies, departemental and government politics the company failed to establish such a service and instead operated the aircraft for charter, before deciding to liquidate the company in the autumn of 1986. The airline had its main base at Bod√∏ Airport, and was planning to establish oil-spill protection bases at Hammerfest Airport and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget. During its existence the company co-operated closely with Wider√∏e, which was approved by the authorities as the operators maintenance organization. History One of the airline's Twin Otters The airline was established in 1983 with a share capital of NOK 50,000, and with Harald Olsen as managing director. In November 1983, they announced to the authorities and the general public plans to establish a fleet of four DHC-6/300 Twin Otters, for the application of dispersant on oil spills at sea as part of the national oil spill protection system, as well as providing an airborne radar surveillance and positioning system. The government was initially favorable to the concept, particularly as an element in improving oil spill protection and response at sea, in conjunction with permitting the oil industry to commence exploration north of the 62nd parallel north, but unfortunately government and departmental politics and the oil companies' unwillingness to contribute to the system, led to the company's demise. The company aimed to have two aircraft operative in June 1984, and be fully operational with 35 to 40 employees and four aircraft by 1985, when all-year oil drilling would start in the Norwegian Sea. Use of aircraft for oil spill reduction was at the time established in the United Kingdom, and Norsk Forurensningskontroll aimed to create a similar preparedness for Norway in cooperation with the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority. The cost of the four aircraft was stipulated to approximately NOK 35 million. Operation started in May 1984 with an aircraft on dry lease from Wider√∏e (LN-BNS), which was also used as system development platform. The airline stated that they hoped to have 30 to 50 operations per year. In September, one of the aircraft was displayed at Farnborough Airshow, and Norsk Forurensningskontroll stated that they hoped to sell the technology abroad. The idea of having an oil spill services of this type was eventually abandoned by the authorities and by the oil industry, and instead NFK started using their aircraft for various charter purposes, such as bird counting for universities and parachuting. In 1986, the company gained a contract with the French government for supplying a French‚ÄìCanadian semi-military female expedition, aiming to traverse the polar basin from the northernmost tip of Svalbard to the North Pole on skis. The aircraft was based in Svalbard, and a number of other scientific and exploration expeditions were supported, including electronic mapping of the headrock underneath glaciers, under a contract for the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University, financed by British Petroleum. The company filed for bankruptcy in October 1986. At the time it had NOK 29 million in debt, while its assets were three Twin Otters with an estimated value of NOK 21 million. At the time, one plane was on lease to the national airline of Portugal ( TAP), flying scheduled operations on the archipelago of Madeira. The largest creditors were Sparebanken Nord, who was owed 13 million and had collateral in two aircraft, Sparebanken Nordland, who were owed NOK 11 million and had collateral in one aircraft, and Kredittkassen/Fiskernes Bank, who were owed NOK 1.9 million. The banks estimated they had lost NOK 8 million on the venture. Organization and aircraft The company had its head office in Bod√∏ and main base at Bod√∏ Airport. It cooperated with Wider√∏e, also based in Bod√∏, for crews and maintenance services. The aircraft was planned to be stationed on 24-hour watch, with a reaction time of 30 minutes during daytime and 60 minutes during night. Tests showed that aircraft could be used for spills up to , depending on the type of oil. The dispersant should ideally be applied two hours after discharge. The dispersant application system developed for the De Havilland of Canada DHC-6/300 Twin Otter aircraft consisted of two aluminumfive- chamber tanks for dispersant. The uniqueness of the system on board the aircraft, as it was developed by the operator NFK and Wider√∏e's engineering department, was primarily that it was self-contained and propelled by bleed air tapped from one of the two Pratt & Whitney gas turbines on the aircraft, pressurizing the tanks. The arrangement of the tanks gave no change in Center of Gravity during discharge of the dispersant.

The 2011 Chile blackout was a major power outage that occurred on 24 September 2011, approximately between 20:30 and 21:45 local time (23:30 and 00:45 UTC respectively), although the time of reinstatement varied geographically. It mainly affected the regions from Coquimbo to Maule, where the blackout was total, but it also reportedly partially affected the Atacama and B√≠o B√≠o regions. The blackout affected approximately nine million Chileans. The cause of the blackout, which started at 20:30 local time (UTC‚àí03:00), was later determined to be equipment failure at an electrical substation. Rodrigo √Ålvarez Zenteno, Minister of Energy, noted a computer system malfunction and \\"oscillation problems\\" affecting two power lines. The blackout interrupted mobile phone service and forced the evacuation of thousands of rail and rapid transit passengers in Santiago, the capital city. It also delayed a concert by pop singer Ricky Martin A supermarket in Quilicura was looted, and a youth was wounded during a confrontation between the looters and police. The outage affected operations at a number of copper mines, of which Chile is the world's top producer. The Los Bronces mine, operated by Anglo American, halted production temporarily and later, with power from generators, resumed at one-third capacity. CODELCO, Chile's state-owned copper mining company, reported that its Andina division and the El Teniente mine had lost power but continued operations using generators until power was restored. Investigation On 6 December 2011, the Chile regulatory authority Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels (SEC) determined that the cause of the blackout was an electrical short circuit in a 220 Kilovolt capacitor bank at the Ancoa electrical substation which is located in Linares, Chile, and the subsequent malfunction of the associated protective relay equipment that should have prevented the cascading failure. SEC also determined that the time needed to restore power was prolonged by both procedural and equipment issues. As a result of the investigation, SEC has assessed charges against the following four power companies; Transelec, Endesa (Chile), Colb√∫n S.A., and Chilectra. The Superintendent of the SEC, Luis Avila Bravo, said \\"we are making charges for not maintaining the equipment in good condition, which ultimately represents a threat to the power system security as well as for problems in applying the procedures used to restore the supply of power \\". Avila added that companies now have 15 days to respond to the charges, after which the SEC may determine sanctions, and possible fines of up to 10,000 AWU (approx. $9M US) although the final amount will depend on the merits of each investigation.

After his initial training at the Scuola Industriale Triestina, Guido Marussig moved to Venice to attend the Academy of Fine Arts thanks to a scholarship from Trieste City Council. In 1905 he participated in the Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte di Venezia, and was to continue to do so in the following years. He was a Symbolist painter influenced by the work of the Vienna Secession, and particularly the art of Gustav Klimt, and he also experimented with engraving techniques. He contributed illustrations to the magazine L‚ÄôEroica and from 1918 to 1937 he taught at the Scuola del Libro in Milan, where he had moved in 1916. In 1921 he participated in designing and decorating Gabriele D‚ÄôAnnunzio‚Äôs Vittoriale; he had already designed the sets for his tragedy La nave. Towards the end of the decade he became a member of the Novecento Italiano group, whose poetics also influenced later works such as the mosaic Justice Entering the Courtroom (1939) in the Palazzo di Giustizia in Milan. During subsequent decades his paintings acquired an ever greater degree of geometric abstraction, while he continued to work as a set designer and to contribute to various art periodicals. He designed the sets for the first opera production at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan following its reconstruction after bombing during the Second World War. Verdi's Nabucco opened on 26 December 1946. Guido Marussig died in Gorizia in 1972.

Harriet Walter, who played the role of Bert (a boy apprentice), writes of the original production: \\"I had spent most of the evening under a table scraping out paint tins, and yet I remain prouder of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists than of most other shows I have been involved with. The reason for this is simple. We had time.... The show belonged to us all. Every experience in the last six months, whether ordeal or treat, had bound our imaginations together and this informed the quality of the work.\\" Walter, 2003; p 60. Among the many positive reviews of Lowe's play, Irving Wardle wrote of the original production: \\"...it is an independent work of great skill and integrity, putting the original to the test of physical action and personal experience... for those who still find England blanketed with a thick fog of political evasion it is sheer pleasure to watch this lucid, beautifully organised account of the roots of our present industrial chaos.\\" Wardle, 1978 There have been many revivals of the play since 1978. In July 1983, John Adams directed the play at the Half Moon Theatre in London, with a cast including Josie Lawrence.Anthony Masters, 1983. In 1985 Stephen Daldry directed a production for Metro Theatre, which toured until 1987. In February 1991, John Adams directed the play again, a touring production for Birmingham Rep; the tour travelled as far as Birmingham, Alabama. Stephen Daldry directed the play again in 1998, with a co-production by Theatre Royal Stratford East and the Liverpool Playhouse. In 2011, Townsend Productions produced a two handed version of Lowe's play which is currently touring the UK.Townsend Productions website, 2010 In 2010 Lowe worked with South African company Isango Portobello on a new version of his play, setting it in 1950s Cape Town. Directed by Mark Dornford-May, with musical direction by Pauline Malefane and Mandisi Dyantyis, The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists ‚Äì Izigwili Ezidlakazelayo opened at the Fugard Theatre, District Six, Cape Town in October 2010.Gordon, 2010 This production is due to visit the Hackney Empire in May 2012. Themes: politics and work The play is about a group of painters and decorators and their struggle for survival in a complacent and stagnating Edwardian England. Tressell's novel had affected Lowe profoundly, when he first read it as a young man. \\"My father, unlike Owen in almost every aspect, suffered like him from TB and had been a brickie and decorator before the war. The attitude of the workers to socialism seemed, in my young way, to be exactly like the one I encountered when I heatedly argued with family. In a way, I identified with Owen. Owen also became the father I wanted badly. My relationship with my own father at that time was at its lowest. He, Owen, was a man alone who had not given in. The bastards couldn't grind him down. The analysis of society was not what struck me, because I already... had come to these beliefs. It did not, in that sense, convert me. It did something much more fundamental. It spoke to me directly, out of intense pain, saying \\"You're not mad. You're not on your own.\\"... It was the nearest to finding a father, a friend across that time, that I had ever known. I tried to persuade anyone to read it. It seemed irresistible to me. It still does.\\"Lowe, 1979; p3. Apart from politics, a key theme in Lowe's play is work itself. Since physical labour was so central to the novel, it played a large part in the Joint Stock workshop. The company worked in the morning refurbishing an old warehouse as an annexe for Dartington College of Arts, supervised by a professional site foreman.Walter, 2003; p48 In the play, apart from their poverty and worries about keeping their job, most of the time the men are also frustrated at not being allowed to do a good job. (The bosses are not really interested in the quality of the work, their main interest is in keeping down costs to make more profit.) So the Moorish room episode, in which Owen is given the chance to use his skills to the full, is a key part of Lowe's play. Even though he knows that his work will only be enjoyed by the bosses, Owen desperately wants to do the job: OWEN: \\"Just gi' me the chance of it, eh? I could do a good job. No slapping paint over rotten wood. Hearing the worms chewing away behind the paint. No papering over cracks. Burn the paint right back. Strip it down. Treat the walls. Stop the cracks. Dry it. Clean base. Three coats of white. Clean canvas. No wood that crumbles to dust. No wall to powder. Real work. Just once. I'm due. It's my right.\\"Lowe, 1983; p 19. Plot The play is about a group of house-painters in Mugsborough in 1906: skilled painters, labourers, an apprentice boy (Bert); and their bosses, site foreman (Crass), works foreman (Hunter), and the owner of the firm (Rushton). Skilled men earn seven pence per hour, labourers five pence and the first year apprentice earns nothing; as works foreman, Hunter gets two per cent of the firm‚Äôs profits, so he is always looking to screw down costs. Rushton's firm is redecorating a house, The Cave, owned by Mayor Sweater. Hunter takes on a skilled man (Easton) at cut rate (six and half pence). Easton has been unemployed for a long time, and he and his wife have a baby on the way. Whenever Hunter visits the site, the men are terrified he will find some excuse to sack them. This time, he gets Crass to suggest whom to sack to make room for Easton. Crass mentions Owen, \\"wi' his far-fetched ideas\\", and also \\"them old men, sir. It‚Äôs them what‚Äôs holdin‚Äô us back‚Ä¶ Allers trying to do it proper.‚Äú Hunter shouts at a terrified Linden ‚Äì the oldest of the men ‚Äì for taking too long cleaning down a door before painting. Later, he catches Linden smoking on the job and sacks him on the spot. When the men break ‚Äì for breakfast or for their dinner ‚Äì they often talk about politics. One of them ‚Äì Owen ‚Äì is a socialist and he tries to convince his workmates that the cause of the poverty which they all fear is not foreign labour, overpopulation or machines but the capitalist system. Later, he demonstrates the great Money Trick with slices of bread and pocket- knives: showing that in our current system, money only makes the bosses richer while leaving the workers as poor and insecure as ever. Owen is summoned to see Rushton. The men think he is going to be sacked because of his politics. Instead, he is offered a special job of work, to decorate the drawing-room of The Cave in Moorish style (Mayor Sweater has seen something similar in Paris). Owen, a skilled sign-writer, jumps at the chance of using his skills to the full, even offering to prepare the designs in his own time. Rushton tells Hunter that this job at least must be done properly: three (not two) coats of white paint, and gold leaf (not gold paint). With labour and materials, they estimate that work on the Moorish room will cost about fifteen pounds; but they can charge Mayor Sweater forty-five. The morning before the annual works outing (the Beano), work on the house is almost finished and the men are worried that there will be a \\"slaughter\\". Crass reassures Easton that he (Easton) will be last to be laid off, because he is working at cut rate. Meanwhile, Owen teaches Bert how to apply gold leaf to the pattern in the Moorish room. The Beano. Outside a country pub, the men relax ‚Äì play skittles, drink beer, joke and talk (Owen has agreed not to talk about politics for one day). Easton borrows some tackle from the landlord, and takes Bert fishing. When it's time for the meal, they all try to find a seat as far away from Hunter as possible. The men stand while Hunter says grace, but he turns into a sermon (it's Whit, and Hunter is very religious); in the end the men sit down and the waitress starts serving the soup before he's finished. After they've eaten their fill and are sitting smoking, Crass gives a report on the finances for the Beano. Rushton, Mayor Sweater and some of the other bosses are there now, at another table. There are toasts to Rushton, Hunter and Mayor Sweater, and each replies with a speech. Hunter just gives a few words of thanks; Rushton talks about how the men and the masters depend on each other, \\"the men work with their hands, the masters with their brains...\\"; and Mayor Sweater makes a political speech, attacking socialists, \\"Most of those sorts are chaps who are too lazy to work their livin'\\". Crass challenges Owen to respond, but when Owen says nothing Crass mocks him as a coward. So, Harlow defends Owen and challenges what Mayor Sweater has said: about socialists; the idea that the men don't use their brains at work and that the men and the masters have common interests. Crass responds by calling for a sing-song; Crass himself sings an anti-political music hall song Two Lovely Black Eyes. On the last day's work on The Cave, Hunter calls together the skilled men. He tells them that he will only pay six and a half pence an hour from now on: \\"take it or leave it.\\" The men decide to stand up to Hunter and refuse to work at this new rate, \\"He's got to have the skilled men.\\" But when Crass tells them that one of them ‚Äì Easton ‚Äì is already working at the new rate, the men realise they have to accept it. Mayor Sweater and his wife give a tea party to show off the Moorish Room, and then hold a secret meeting of Mugsborough council: they agree to get Sweater elected to Parliament. The last part of the play is a series of interlocking short scenes. Crass and Easton work on a coffin; at Owen's house, Bert makes a child's wheelbarrow (a present for Easton's baby) while Owen paints a banner; Hunter reckons up the final costs of the Moorish Room, his obsession with numbers (the costs) scrambling in his mind with apocalyptic images from the Bible. Philpott collects a coffin plate from Owen (it's for Linden's funeral - he died in the workhouse); Hunter, in the grip of his calculating/religious madness, cuts his wrists. Crass takes over as works foreman. Harlow, sacked by Hunter after the Beano for his \\"far fetched ideas\\", comes to persuade Owen to come to a Labour meeting. Owen says, \\"we've got to hold out for the works, not go for the crumbs\\", but agrees to come. The play ends with them raising the banner which Owen has been working on: \\"Workers Unite!\\" Sources * Wardle, Irving, Masterly evening ‚Äì The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists at Riverside Studios.

He subsequently moved to New York City, having his first solo show of paintings at Team Gallery in 2002. He soon earned critical accolades for his paintings of mountains and trees, and followed with international exhibitions in New York City, Toronto, Tokyo, Vienna, London, Berlin, Austin, Basel, Beijing, and Los Angeles. He is currently represented by Tomio Koyama in Tokyo and Klaus von Nichtssagend in New York. Ken Johnson described his work in The New York Times in 2005: \\"Mr. Butler is toying like a Pop artist with conventions of early 20th-century abstraction...he also revels in painting as an end in itself; so he and we get to have it both ways: we can be both knowing intellectuals and paint-loving hedonists\\". Writer Roberta Smith has written about his work that \\"Few representational painters have managed to rid themselves of quite so much representation and still make pictures.\\" Will Heinrich has written, also in The New York Times: \\"Mr. Butler has narrowed his focus even further, to thrillingly psychedelic effect: His work now seems balanced on a razor blade between Conceptual practice and ‚ÄúThe Starry Night,‚Äù but at the same time, somehow, it has ample room to move.\\"  References   External links  * Benjamin Butler on the Klaus von Nichtssagend website * Benjamin Butler on the Tomio Koyama website * Benjamin Butler on the artist's website Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:Postmodern artists Category:Artists from Kansas Category:People from Wamego, Kansas Category:People from Westmoreland, Kansas ","title":"Benjamin Butler (artist)"},{"id":"33206989","text":"M√∏lleparken The versatility of concrete has led to its appearance in numerous non-traditional formats such as furniture, sculpture and art. Due to improved setting and molding techniques, it is now possible to create more sophisticated shaped furniture using concrete. The added durability of concrete means they can be placed indoors or outdoors, leading to many being located in local parks and community areas. Concrete furniture design is evolving rapidly and cement furniture is making an appearance inside the contemporary home. Cast concrete counters in the kitchen are one thing but furniture designers are bringing the material into the home in a very modern way. History Recent discoveries show that concrete has been used in Mesopotamia and Ancient Rome over 4,000 years ago. However, the application of concrete in interior design and furniture started much later, in the beginning of the 20th century. Thomas Edison is known as a pioneer of concrete development, and the first person to predict the use of concrete furniture. His company Edison Portland Cement Company combined ore milling technologies to develop more durable cement for construction of concrete houses and large building blocks.Thomas Alva Edison And The Concrete Piano Edison created concrete phonograph cabinets and proposed the making of concrete musical instruments, refrigerators, and furniture.History of Concrete from Romans to Thomas Edison Example designers Some example designers who create concrete furniture are Nico Yektai, Peter Harrison, Jo√´l Urruty and Douglas Thayer.Profile of Concrete Sculptors & Designers References Category:Furniture ","title":"Concrete furniture"},{"id":"33207004","text":"Edward Frank Dunn (March 31, 1896 ‚Äì May 5, 1951) was an American actor best known for his roles in comedy films, supporting many comedians such as Charley Chase (with whom he co-directed several short films), Charlie Chaplin, WC Fields and Laurel and Hardy.

It was designed for the South African Railways (SAR) with large coupled wheels for fast passenger service on mainline duties. A single locomotive, no. 2290, was delivered from Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1925. It was superheated, with a plate frame, a Belpaire firebox and Walschaerts valve gear. The Class GG was the only Garratt locomotive on the SAR that was intended primarily for passenger working. Characteristics At diameter, the Class GG had the largest coupled wheels yet seen on a Garratt locomotive in South Africa. An innovation was a coal pusher at the back of the coal bunker, designed to ease the work of the fireman by pushing the coal forward to the front of the bunker when required. It was the only instance of this appliance being used on any SAR locomotive. To keep costs down, the cylinders were not enlarged to compensate for the increased wheel diameter. As a result, the locomotive's tractive effort was inferior to that of the Class 15CA which was introduced on the same line between Touws River and De Aar a year later. The locomotive was capable of speeds of , but it was found to be unsteady at high speed due to the absence of a leading bogie on each engine unit. It could handle a load of on 1 in 80 (1¬º%) gradients and hauled up the of 1 in 40 (2¬Ω%) gradient of the Hex River Railpass in sixty-two minutes without the help of the usual banking locomotive. Service It was initially placed in service at Touws River and employed to work the Union Limited and Union Express fast passenger trains south of De Aar, but because of its unsteadiness at speed it was taken off fast passenger traffic and demoted to ordinary passenger and goods train working out of Cape Town. No more Class GG locomotives were ordered and since it was a non-standard locomotive, it was staged by 1938 and scrapped in 1947.

It was later served with a tram engine. History Rassa Railroad bridge over the Rasa Brook (SO160115) The Rassa Railroad opened in 1794 as an edge railway of approximately gauge. It was laid out by Thomas Dadford, engineer of the Monmouthshire Canal Co., which owned the line. After a few years it was converted to a gauge plateway. A tram engine was used on the route from 1829. At some point the owner of the Rhymney Ironworks also secured running rights over the Rassa line. Route The railway ran for 2 1/2 miles, directly north from Sirhowy then east through the village of Rassau to Beaufort. At Trevil Machine (location of a weighing machine), where the line turned sharply to the east, a junction was made with the Trefil Rail Road from the limestone quarries at Trefil. A further junction with the Trefil line at Shop Row led to the Ebbw Vale Ironworks at Pont-y-Gof. There was at least one viaduct. Sirhowy was also served by the Sirhowy continuation of the Nine Mile Point Tramroad. The recommended carrying weight was up to 45 hundredweight per set of wheels, but loadings of up to 3 tons of iron were noted. Other materials carried included at least coal and limestone. Today The former tramroad lies within Blaenau Gwent, now passing communities such as Rassau, Carmeltown and Glyncoed. The former tramroad permanent way is represented now by areas of tarmac and pathways. There is at least one surviving stone bridge.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, Baltimore Orioles, and Seattle Mariners. Early life Clevenger was raised in Glen Burnie, Maryland, attended Overlook Elementary and graduated from Mount Saint Joseph High School in 2004. He was the starting shortstop on the school's varsity baseball team which won the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) A conference championship in his senior year. He hit .347 as a first-team All-Southland Conference shortstop in his only year at Southeastern Louisiana University in 2005. After transferring to Chipola College, he led the Indians with a .395 batting average and 77 hits. Professional career =Draft and minor leagues= He was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the seventh round (209th overall) of the 2006 MLB Draft. After signing with the Cubs on June 14, he began his professional career as the starting second baseman with the Boise Hawks. He started making the transition to catcher the following season after Hawks manager Steve McFarland convinced him that a left-handed batter at the position had a better chance of a faster promotion to the majors. During the 2011 season Clevenger played for the Tennessee Smokies where he batted .295 and hit 5 home runs. He also played for the Iowa Cubs where in 86 at bats he batted .407 and hit 3 home runs. =Chicago Cubs= Chicago Cubs in 2012 Clevenger was called up to the Cubs from the expanded 40-man roster. He made his major league debut September 26, 2011, however he only played in two games during the 2011 season. Clevenger made the opening day roster during the 2012 season. However, on April 28, Clevenger was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right oblique. Clevenger finished the 2012 season with a .201 batting average, one home run, and 16 RBIs. =Baltimore Orioles= On July 2, 2013, Clevenger was traded to the Baltimore Orioles with Scott Feldman for pitchers Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop. He was optioned to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides after the trade. He was recalled on September 1, but did not play for the Orioles until September 13 against the Toronto Blue Jays. On August 17, 2015 he became the first Baltimore native to hit a home run for the Orioles at Camden Yards. Clevenger batted .225/.289/.337 for the 2014 season. Showalter was dissatisfied with Clevenger's defense (he caught 3 of 20 attempted base- stealers), and the team had problems with his conditioning. Clevenger as of December 2014 had one minor league option remaining. Clevenger was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk Tides on April 7, 2015 and on April 24, was placed on the DL with a left thumb contusion. He was recalled to Baltimore on May 26, and made his season debut two days later. He went 2-for-4 with an RBI in the game. Clevenger played in four games before being optioned back to Norfolk on June 5. Clevenger would end up making the IL All-Star team. After several roster moves by the Orioles, Clevenger was once again recalled by Baltimore on August 14. Two days later, he set a new career-high in hits, going 4-for-6 with a double and an RBI in an 18-2 rout over the Oakland Athletics. In 2015 he batted .287/.314/.426 in 101 at bats. =Seattle Mariners= On December 2, 2015, the Orioles traded Clevenger to the Seattle Mariners for Mark Trumbo and C. J. Riefenhauser. Clevenger had a poor 2016, appearing in only 20 games at catcher for the Mariners and batting .221/.303/.309 and caught 5 of 16 attempted base stealers before sustaining a broken hand on June 29 in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, an injury that proved season-ending. On November 2, 2016, Clevenger was outrighted to the minors. He elected free agency on November 4. =Lancaster Barnstormers= On July 21, 2017, Clevenger signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 2017 he batted .293/.357/.366. He became a free agent after the 2017 season. Suspension On September 22, 2016 Clevenger tweeted that he thought it was ironic that black people were beating white people after a black man had been shot dead by a black policeman and that Black Lives Matter protestors as well as President Obama and all Black Lives Matter supporters should be \\"locked behind bars like animals,\\" prompting an official response from Mariners GM Jerry Dipoto disavowing those remarks. The next day, Dipoto announced that Clevenger was suspended without pay for the remainder of the season.

Mexia was stationed in St Augustine and was given a diplomatic mission to the native populations living south of St. Augustine and in the Cape Canaveral area. This mission resulted in a \\"Period of Friendship\\" between the Spanish and the Ais native population. When Pedro de Ibarra became the Spanish Governor of Florida, he knew the Spanish needed to improve relations with the natives, so he sent Mexia on a diplomatic mission in 1605 to gain knowledge of the lands and populations south of St. Augustine, as well as to assist that year's treasure fleet on its way back to Spain. Mexia wrote about his experiences in the area of the native Ais in a document known as a Derrotero, a self-proclaimed \\"truthful account\\" and description of his journey in the land of Ais. Mexia also created a map in color. His journey completed in 1605, his Derrotero and map were sent to the King of Spain in a letter from Pedro de Ibarra. His letters and map show native towns and place names south of St. Augustine. These include: * Surruque In New Smyrna Beach. Mexia and his party arrived at Surruque on June 6, 1605 and remained in the area for eight days while he waited for orders to proceed to the Ais Indian Nation. * Nocoroco town - mouth of Tomoka River,in Volusia County., Florida Historical Society. The Florida Historical Quarterly, Vol. 27, No. 4 (April 1949), p344-345 * After leaving Nocoroco Mexia writes about passing by a Buhio A West Indian (Arawak) word for a native hut. It came to be applied to anything from the family dwelling to the large communal lodge which according to Bishop Calderon, would accommodate 2000 to 3000 people. * Caparca site - New Smyrna (Volusia County) * Potopotoya - Haulover Canal, place where Native Americans crossed land with their canoes * Savo * Lagoon of Sababoche - southern extent of the present-day Banana River * Town of Savochequeya - present-day Newfound Harbor in Merritt Island, Florida * Lagoon of Ulumay‚Äîthe Banana River Lagoon north of the Lagoon of Sababoche * Through \\"Callejon\\" to Pentoaya (Indian Harbor Beach on the barrier island and Eau Gallie on the mainland), A Distance of * Traverse of the Grand Bay of Ais * Two small islands in the Indian River Lagoon (one of which was Grant Farm Island) * Then to small fresh water river, now called the Sebastian River * Then to the great Indian town of the Ais 1.5 leagues away (or about 4.5 to 5 miles), now called the Kroegel Homestead but also called Barker's Bluff (8IR84) prior to the mound being sold for road-fill in the early 1900s. Alvaro returned to St Augustine and made his report to Ibarra on July 11, 1605 more than a month after his departure. The mission was considered a success as on September 2, 1605 the elusive Capitan Grande (Ais Chief) finally arrived in St. Augustine accompanied by his mandador, the chiefs of Surruque and Urbia, and twenty Indians. Agreements were made that the Ais Indians would return shipwrecked sailors to the Spanish for a ransom. Further reading * Brech, Alan and J. F.

It is based on the play Hot Money by Aben Kandel. The film is preserved at the Library of Congress and in the Warner Archive.Catalog of Holdings The American Film Institute Collection and The United Artists Collection at The Library of Congress p.79 c.1978 by The American Film Institute Plot Gar Evans (William Powell) agrees to promote Ginsburg's product, artificial rubber created from sewage, only after his friend Mike Donahey (Frank McHugh) assures him it is not a scam. Gar is superstitious; he believes he will only succeed if his long-suffering girlfriend Francine Dale (Evelyn Brent) joins them on the venture. She, however, has given up on him, especially since he left her five days before to pick up something, and never came back. It is only with great effort that he convinces her to give him another chance. Gar quickly incorporates the \\"Golden Gate Artificial Rubber Company\\", rents a whole floor of a building, installs old crony Clifford Gray (Guy Kibbee) as president, gives Helen Wilson (Evalyn Knapp) a job as a secretary, and hires a lot of high-pressure salesmen to sell shares. As news spreads, natural rubber company stock prices start to fall, and Mr. Banks (Charles Middleton) offers to buy the company on behalf of the established rubber firms, but the bid is too low for Gar. Banks then threatens to get an injunction preventing sales of Gar's shares pending an investigation. Gar welcomes it. However, Ginsburg (promoted to \\"Colonel\\" by Gar), has misplaced the inventor of the process, Dr. Rudolph Pfeiffer (Harry Beresford). When he is finally located and set to work making a sample, Gar invites scientists to inspect the finished product, only to discover that Pfeiffer is a deranged crackpot (his next invention involves hens laying already decorated Easter eggs). Francine quits in disgust and prepares to sail to South America and marry Se√±or Rodriguez. Despite his lawyer's advice to flee to another state, Gar insists on taking full responsibility. Just as all seems lost, Banks offers to reimburse all the shareholders and pay Gar enough to make a $100,000 profit just to be rid of the whole mess (and restore natural rubber stock prices). Gar rushes to the dock to retrieve the Golden Gate controlling shares, which he had signed over to Francine. While there, he wins her back by promising to give up promoting, only to have Donahey show up with a scheme for Alaskan gold/marble/spruce wood. Soon, Gar is plotting his next campaign.

In 1900 his landscape painting received definitive recognition by being awarded the Principe Umberto Prize at the Brera exhibition, followed by the gold medal at the 8th Munich International Art Exhibition the following year. In 1903 the art dealer Ferruccio Stefani, who was active in South America, organised a solo exhibition for him, which travelled to Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Valparaiso. His works were also shown at the International Centenary Exhibition in Buenos Aires in 1910 and that same year the Venice Biennale devoted a whole room to forty-six works by Sartorelli. In 1924 he moved to Milan, where the Galleria Pesaro mounted a solo exhibition for him the following year. In 1940, a few months after his death, the 23rd Venice Biennale devoted a major retrospective to him organized by his son Carlo, who was also a painter.

Biography In 1897 Emilio Sommariva enrolled at the Brera Academy where he attended Angelo Comolli‚Äôs School of Decoration from 1898 to 1899. Financial difficulties forced him to abandon his studies. He was then employed as a photographer by the Compagnia Continentale Brunt & C. foundry and subsequently by the Ganzini photographic studio. A few months later in 1902 he opened his own atelier in Viale Monforte (now Viale Pavia) and during the following years he moved to Via Paolo and Via Montenapoleone. With some difficulty Sommariva eventually became established as a portraitist who photographed the intelligentsia of the day. He also made reproductions of works of art, took industrial photographs, architectural and landscape photographs. His fame was sealed by the recognition received at the 1911 Esposizione Internazionale di Fotografia Artistica e Scientifica di Roma (Comitato delle Feste gold medal) and the Turin Esposizione e Concorso Internazionale di Fotografia (diploma of honour). In 1922 he made a name for himself on the international scene by winning the first prize at the International Exhibition of Professional Artistic Photography in London. In the 1920s he also began to exhibit as a painter: he participated in the Brera Biennale in 1925, in the Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte di Venezia in 1926 and in the exhibitions held by the Permanente in Milan the following decade. During this period he executed numerous landscapes inspired by the foothills of the Alps in Lombardy and Piedmont where he went during his frequent stays at the family villa at Lanzo d‚ÄôIntelvi. A retrospective of his extensive pictorial output was held at the Galleria Ranzini, Milan, in 1950.

Founded in 2010, NAVA engages in education, protest, political lobbying and investigations in order to bring about its aim to abolish vivisection and other forms of animal research. The website has been inactive since June 2012 after its chairman, Luke Steele, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for intimidating staff at Harlan laboratories Investigations NAVA have headed a number of high-profile investigations into animal research and the breeding of animals for experimentation. In 2010, an expos√© was released into the transportation of primates from the Caribbean for use in laboratories. The report focused on US-cargo giant Amerijet International who were, at the time, shipping monkeys to American laboratories. An insight was given into thirteen breaches of the US Animal Welfare Act, which included primates being left without adequate food and water, insufficient provisions leading to the risk of suffocation and other similar allegations of cruelty. Subsequently, the airline placed an embargo on the transportation of animals for research purposes. A 2011 report named 'Born to Die' was produced, focussing on the breeding of beagles for research by Harlan Laboratories. Specific allegations included canines being provided with insufficient exercise, kennel units being improperly maintained and soiled with faeces and members of staff shaving obscenities into the fur of dogs. The report was based on the claims of a NAVA activist who had been working undercover at the facility. Beagle Farm controversy B&K; Universal is a British breeder of animals for research purposes. In 2011 the company placed a planning application with East Riding of Yorkshire Council to construct a large facility, maintaining a colony of thousands of dogs to be sold to laboratories for use in vivisection. A coalition of groups, including NAVA, the BUAV and NAVS, rallied supporters in Beverley, East Yorkshire, to oppose the facility's approval and gathered objections from members of the public nationwide. On Thursday 16 June 2011, a Planning Committee hearing was held at County Hall, Beverley, to conclude a decision regarding the application. Committee members turned down the proposal with a majority vote. In August 2011, B&K; Universal announced the lodging of an appeal with Bristol's Planning Inspectorate. A petition was gathered by anti-vivisectionists receiving over 28,000 signatures opposing the building of the beagle breeding farm. The application was recovered by the Secretary of State and Conservative MP, the Rt Hon Eric Pickles, as a matter of national public interest. His decision is yet to be announced. Campaign for the Abolition of Vivisection September 2011 saw NAVA heighten calls for the British government to honour pledges made to reduce the number of animals used in the nation's laboratories. NAVA members gathered in London to march on Downing Street as the start of a new campaign to bring about the abolition of vivisection begun. Marchers carried purple flags, the colour of the anti-vivisectionists, and delivered a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron reiterating the calls.

(Art collections of Fondazione Cariplo) Vittore Zanetti Zilla (1864-1946) was an Italian painter. Biography Zilla was born in Venice, where he attended a technical school and at the same time began to approach painting by frequenting the studio of Giacomo Favretto, a family friend. After obtaining his secondary school leaving certificate in 1882, he decided to learn the rudiments of art under the guidance of Egisto Lancerotto. In 1884 he left to do his military service in Naples and Sicily, subsequently he returned to Venice and then moved with his family to the Abruzzo for several years, where he worked as a teacher. However, he continued his artistic research and in 1898 he started out on a journey through Europe, developing close contacts above all with the French landscapists. He took part in the Esposizioni Internazionali d‚ÄôArte di Venezia from the first edition in 1895 onwards (with a one-man show in 1914), making a name for himself with his lagoonscapes characterised by their decorative style not devoid of French influences. He experimented with watercolour and varnished tempera, which enabled him to obtain bright pure colours. He also participated in international exhibitions including the one in Munich in 1893 and the one in Buenos Aires in 1910. After the Caporetto defeat during World War I, he fled to Milan where he was to live in the years to follow. He organized two one-man shows at the Galleria Pesaro, in 1918 and 1920. He died in Milan.

It is a joint venture between entrepreneur David Lyons and PBS Distribution, a joint venture of the broadcaster and the WGBH Educational Foundation which owns the international rights to the bulk of PBS's output. PBS America operates much like BBC Studios, a profit-making enterprise managed separately from the main non- profit, publicly financed arm, that will ideally generate money for its parent. It is provided by pay-television operators as part of their channel packages and carries advertising. Unlike PBS in the United States it does not solicit donations from viewers.  Availability  PBS America was launched on 1 November 2011 (as PBS UK) on Sky and Virgin Media. On 23 August 2011, PBS UK launched a placeholder channel called Rosa on Sky channel 231, however they were able to acquire the more prominent channel 166 EPG slot from Information TV for use from launch. On 28 October 2011, a barker channel for PBS UK was added to Virgin Media channel 243. The cable operator has also secured the rights to offer PBS content on its video on demand service, including the Virgin Media Player. On 19 April 2012, the channel's Sky EPG slot was put up for sale, with seven figure offers anticipated by broker Canis Media. While PBS UK wasn't closing, they were considering moving from the Entertainment genre to Documentaries. On Virgin Media, the channel is already positioned in the equivalent Factual genre. On 16 July, Canis Media confirmed that PBS had received numerous offers for the slot but they had fallen below expectations. PBS decided to stay in the Entertainment genre, while remaining interested in moving genre and keeping the slot on the market. On 24 July 2013, PBS America moved to the Documentaries section on Sky channel 534, formerly used by Blighty, as part of a deal with UKTV. The exchange came about as Blighty was to be replaced on satellite by Drama, UKTV were required to exchange one of their documentary category slots for one in the Entertainment grid. PBS America returned into the top 100 channels on Sky following the EPG reshuffle of 1 May 2018, in which channels previously located in the Documentaries category were integrated in with those of the Entertainment sector. On 13 December 2017 PBS America was launched on Freeview. In July 2018 it was announced that the Channel 5-owned video on demand service My5 had reached a deal to include content from PBS America into its offering.TVWise, 2018-07-04 In the 4th quarter of 2019, a 24-hour +1 channel launched only on Freeview on channel 93. It requires a HD-capable receiver and one must be in the channel coverage area as well. PBS America increased its coverage to be nationwide but changed broadcasting hours to be 1pm-11pm after CBS Drama went full time.  Programming  The channel consists of content drawn exclusively from PBS member stations, both older and current for which it is able to secure the rights. It doesn't make its own programmes in the UK, but a few of them are British productions which have been shown on PBS in the United States before being recycled back to the UK by PBS America, e.g. What the Ancients Did for Us. The PBS America line-up heavily features documentaries and history programs such as American Experience, Frontline and Nova as well as Ken Burns documentary films such as Prohibition. In total PBS America aired 500 unique hours of content in 2011 and will air 1000 hours in 2012. Children's programming such as Sesame Street does not air on the channel because the market is \\"well served for kids' content\\", along with commercial distribution contracts with other existing domestic children's networks.  Branding and marketing  The channel's slogan is \\"Where television matters\\". Channel 4's Channel 4 Sales division is the exclusive advertising sales representative for the network. Branding and design agency Dunning Penney Jones was appointed to create the channel's on-air look and feel. As well as repurposing the PBS branding used in the US, they created new idents specifically for the UK channel. The agency also designed four colour themes for each of PBS America's four programming strands for use on the channel, website and any off-air marketing. On 4 July 2012, PBS UK was renamed PBS America.

The series premiered on Thursday 4 October 2012 on BBC One and on Friday 19 October 2012 on Cinemax. Overview Samantha (Melissa George) is an espionage operative for \\"Byzantium\\", a private intelligence agency. She survives an attempt on her life, which she strongly suspects was orchestrated by members of the company she works for. After recovering and returning to active duty, she goes back to work undercover as a nanny, not knowing who tried to kill her or whom to trust. It becomes evident that the attempt on her life is tied into a horrific event from her childhood. Main cast *Melissa George as Samantha \\"Sam\\" Hunter/Alex Kent *Adam Rayner as Aidan Marsh *Stephen Dillane as Rupert Keel *Stephen Campbell Moore as Stephen Turner *Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Deacon Crane *Morven Christie as Zoe Morgan *Lex Shrapnel as Ian Fowkes *Dhaffer L'Abidine as Bernard Faroux *Dermot Crowley as George Ballard *Oscar Kennedy as Edward Turner *Indira Varma as Natalie Thorpe *Patrick Malahide as Jack Turner *Doc Brown as Tyrone *Richard Lintern as Hector Stokes *Uriel Emil Pollack as Hasan Moussa Production The series was created by Frank Spotnitz (best known as executive producer and head writer for The X-Files), who will write the majority of the episodes of series 1. Spotnitz is executive producing with Kudos‚Äô Stephen Garrett (executive producer of Law & Order: UK, Spooks/MI5), Jane Featherstone (producer behind Spooks/MI5, The Hour, Life on Mars), Alison Jackson (Ashes to Ashes, Eternal Law), and BBC's Christopher Aird (Spooks, The Inspector Lynley Mysteries). After Spotnitz had wrapped up The X-Files he met Stephen Garrett and Jane Featherstone of Kudos Film and Television. They asked him to come to the UK and work with British television. Spotnitz had lived in Europe before and was interested in returning. He claims the idea was appealing but it simply never happened. The years passed and Spotnitz was talking to The X-Files star Gillian Anderson, who was visiting Los Angeles from London where she lives, and she asked, \\"Would you ever consider doing a show (in Britain)?\\". Spotnitz started talking to her about doing a spy series and then the first call he made was to Stephen Garrett since the two lost touch. \\"You know the idea of doing a show in England? I think I may finally have it\\". On 13 January 2011, the BBC announced the show ‚Äî then called Morton. Gillian Anderson was no longer attached to the show; it took Spotnitz and Kudos longer than estimated to get the green light from the BBC and by then, Anderson was too busy with other projects. Spotnitz relocated to London with his family. While trying to get Hunted off the ground, he served as co- producer and head writer for Strike Back: Project Dawn (or just Strike Back in the United States), which was also produced by HBO for Cinemax, but co- produced with another British broadcaster, BSkyB (for Sky1), not the BBC. On 22 September 2011, reports confirmed that HBO/Cinemax would come on board as co-producers and that the name Morton had been scrapped and the new name was Nemesis. On 6 March 2012, Spotnitz announced on his homepage that the show's title had been changed again to Hunted. Spotnitz spent a lot of time researching private spy agencies. He told Screen International: \\"It's not an area I was very aware of until I went looking for it. Most private contractors don't want to be noticed. Their websites are dry and boring and they don't want the wrong kind of attention. I talked to people who run these companies in the US, United Kingdom and Switzerland and then I researched the type of personality working at them\\". Filming started on location in Wales, Scotland, London and Morocco. In early March, scenes were filmed in East Linton, Scotland at a local Deli Shop. \\"There are no sound stages. It's all location filming. It‚Äôs really expensive and difficult to do, but it looks so much better and has a real feel of authenticity\\", Spotnitz told The Hollywood Reporter. \\"It's international and it looks international\\". During the series, Sam has childhood memories of an oast house and in episode 5 she finds the Oast House. This is the oast house at Little Scotney Farm, Lamberhurst, Kent. It is still a working oast house owned by the National Trust, producing hops to make \\"Scotney Ale\\". The first series takes place mainly in London. Had the show been commissioned for a second series, each series would have taken place in a different European city. George, who is based in New York, would have lived in London for six months to film each series. =Sam Hunter spinoff= On 25 September 2012, it was reported that British screenwriter Ben Harris had joined the writing team in preparation for a second series pickup from BBC One and Cinemax. Melissa George has reported that the second series of Hunted would be set in Berlin. The Australian star previously said that her Hunted role \\"could potentially be long-term\\", adding that she may be playing Sam \\"for the next five years\\". On 3 November 2012, it was reported that British screenwriter Claire Wilson had joined the writing team in preparation for a second series pickup from BBC One and Cinemax. However, on 14 November 2012, The Guardian reported that BBC One had decided not to commission a second series of Hunted, citing ratings declines as the primary reason. It was reported the following day that Cinemax was looking into making a second series without the partnership with the BBC. Cinemax has since announced that it is working with Frank Spotnitz to reboot the show, describing the current incarnation as \\"too expensive\\" to continue without BBC support. Spotnitz has revealed that the original plans for Hunted series two ‚Äî which would have followed Sam Hunter to Germany ‚Äî have been abandoned in the wake of the series shake-up. \\"It's going to change ‚Äî that [Berlin plot] was when we still had the BBC as a partner\\", he explained. \\"Now it's one of those funny things where it's the same character, but it's a different series.\\" Spotnitz added that he \\"would very much expect\\" future episodes to air in the UK, adding that he has considered other British networks as potential partners. In June 2013 it was announced that the second series would become a four-hour miniseries called Sam Hunter, airing in 2014. In early 2015, Frank Spotnitz stated that the series‚Äìand spinoff‚Äìhad been officially cancelled by Cinemax, though he and George were open to continuing the project if it were to be picked up by another network.\\"Sam Hunter Dead At Cinemax, But Creator Frank Spotnitz Still Wants Continuation\\" Episode list DVD release On 30 July 2013 HBO Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 via the Warner Archive Collection. This is a manufacture-on-demand (MOD) release, available via WBShop.com and Amazon.com. The series is also available on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK. Web campaign Hunted was accompanied by an Internet campaign carrying content developed during the filming of the series. Known for a psychologically stimulating internet campaign where one would guess what dongle went to various computers. It all turned out to be a honeypot. Reception Reviews of the first episode were mixed. While he liked the plot, Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph was critical of the dialogue and acting: \\"The protagonist pouts constantly and came across more sulky teenager than troubled soul. When you're performing this hokum, you need a heavyweight cast to give it credibility. Spooks had Matthew MacFadyen and Peter Firth, 24 had Kiefer Sutherland, Homeland has Damian Lewis and Claire Danes. Hunted's assorted pretty young things are nowhere near that league. They gazed moodily out of windows but rather than looking haunted by the terrible things they‚Äôd seen, they looked like they were waiting for a minicab\\". The Observers Andrew Anthony compared the series unfavourably with the U.S. television series Homeland: \\"Both have high production values, both are capable of creating fiendishly clever plots, but whereas Homeland seeks to foreground character, Hunted relies on shorthand caricature. Thus the three villains on display last week were a macho Arab, an inscrutable psychopath and a cockney gangster- turned-businessman, holding their faces in such ways as to convey, respectively, machismo, psychopathy, and tasty geezerness\\". Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror was also critical, writing that Hunted \\"relied more on old- fashioned Spooks cliches. Locations like Istanbul were viewed as dangerous ‚Äì ie, full of foreigners, particularly handsome Arabs in suits driving around as if they were in a BMW ad\\". On a more positive note, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, said the U.S. premi√®re had \\"lots of slick suspense, well-turned violence, and a delightful air of menace hanging over everything Sam does\\". Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post also had a favorable review of the U.S. premiere saying \\"To its credit, 'Hunted' doesn't take its profoundly disconnected characters and slap them into a slick, glitzy story about heroism in the face of greed. It marries the doubt, regret and longing they feel into a chugging, twisty spy story about the cost of selling your soul one piece at a time\\".

Set in an idyllic frame story, old legends are worked into a Christian- humanist allegory about ideas of good and evil. Though the novel is initially divided, what is originally the internal story, later spills over into the frame story as well. The story is characterized by its complex narrative structure, its conservative Christian motifs and symbolism, and its precise descriptions of the social dynamics of the village.  Plot  The novella begins with a christening party at a farm, during the course of which a few of the guests in front of the house go for a walk. It catches the godmother's eye that although the house is newly built, an old black post is built into it. At her inquiry, the grandfather tells everyone the story of the post. =First internal narrative= The grandfather tells how a few centuries before, the village had been ruled by a Teutonic Knight named Hans von Stoffeln, who worked the farmers of the village very hard. Von Stoffeln, a strict and aggressive man, relentlessly collected on the tax obligations of his serfs. His unpredictability inspired fear among the peasants, and he would brook no contradiction; any criticism towards Von Stoffeln's rule inspired such harsh retaliation, that the farmers submitted weakly to his will. Von Stoffeln demanded ever more ludicrous tasks, the last of which was the replanting of trees from a distant mountain to form a shaded path on his estate. He demanded this job be done in such a short period, that the peasants could never complete it without abandoning their own harvest and going hungry. At this dire moment, the Devil, in the form of a wild hunter, offered his assistance with the replanting. As payment, he wanted an unbaptized child. At first, the peasants refused his offer. However, Christine, a farmer's wife who had come to the valley from Lindau near Lake Constance, was against the mistreatment of the villagers and wanted an end to all the outrageous demands being enforced by von Stoffeln. After the initial refusal, everything began to go wrong with their project. Finally, Christine convinced the farmers to accept the bargain, believing that they could escape it by baptizing every child immediately at birth. The Devil's pact was sealed when the hunter gives Christine a kiss on her cheek. The hunter used his demonic powers to instill in the kiss a curse, which would ensure his payment. The task of moving the trees suddenly became very easy and was quickly completed. When the first child was born, the pastor saved her by baptizing the girl immediately afterwards. However, Christine soon felt a burning pain on her cheek, exactly where the hunter had kissed her. A black mark appears on her face, which grew into the shape of a black spider. After the second child was baptized, a storm blew in and a swarm of tiny spiders emerged from the enchanted mark on Christine's face. In the village, calamity spreads and the cattle died in their stalls. Thus, the Devil reminded everyone of his contract. Christine and the villagers decide on sacrificing a third newborn, and the plague on their cattle ceased. On the day of the birth, Christine tried to steal the infant so she could sacrifice him to the devil. However, the priest sprinkled him with holy water before she could snatch the infant. Christine is transformed into a demonic spider. Enraged, she kills the priest before fleeing from her village. Christine begins to terrorize the valley, killing both villagers and animals, including von Stoffeln himself. One night, the mother of one of Christine's victims captured the spider, shoved it into a hole near a window post she had prepared, and plugged the hole up. The woman died after she was bitten by it, but peace returned to the valley. After the grandfather finished his story, the guests, now afraid of the house, reluctantly return to the dining room. The grandfather therefore feels obligated to finish the story: =Second internal narrative= In the following years, the valley's citizens continued their lives with a newfound respect towards God. However, over time, many returned to their godless behavior. Finally, a malicious farmhand releases the spider, which kills almost everyone in the village. At the next birth, Christen, a servant of the farmhand who released the spider, rescues the child from the Devil's clutches, captures the spider, and returns it to its old prison. He pays for this service with his life, but he dies in \\"God's Peace\\". Once again, peace and respect towards God continue within the valley. Although the farmhouse was rebuilt several times, the post was always put back in so the villagers can preserve their old blessing. When the latest house was built, the grandfather integrated the old window post into it. The grandfather ends his story on that note, and the christening celebration continues jovially until later that night. The novella ends with a hint that God is watching over everything. Reception and criticism The Black Spider is Gotthelf's best known work. At first little noticed, the story is now considered by many critics to be among the masterworks of the German Biedermeier era and sensibility. Thomas Mann wrote of it in his The Genesis of Doctor Faustus that Gotthelf \\"often touched the Homeric\\" and that he admired The Black Spider \\"like no other piece of world literature.\\" The Black Spider is, in many ways, a precursor to the weird fiction of twentieth-century writers such as Lord Dunsany, Clark Ashton Smith, and H.P. Lovecraft and \\"may very well be one of the first works of weird fiction ever written.\\"http://mysteryfile.com/blog/?p=25767 The novella's depictions of a town led astray in difficult times by a headstrong leader and the morality of collective guilt, gave it renewed relevance in the post-World War II era. Scholars and critics have also focused on the gender norms that emerge from the story. Christine's role as the headstrong and independent woman leads to the first introduction of the spider and her eventual transformation into a monster. The mother of a child then manages to capture the spider, at the cost of her life. Then the malicious, godless farmhand releases it. Finally Christen (who is browbeaten by his overbearing wife and mother) captures the beast again, and dies from its bite. Legacy The Swiss composer Heinrich Sutermeister wrote a one act opera based on the story in 1936, which was first performed as a radio opera. In 1949 a staged version was put on conducted by Silvio Varviso. The first film adaptation was released in 1921 as a silent film; then in 1983, Swiss director Mark Rissi directed a film based on the novel, but with a modern story frame. The story was also the basis for a 1983 opera by Judith Weir. Editions The novella has been translated into English in a number of versions and numerous other languages.

History Duissern is the northernmost station of the original tunnel section that was opened in 1992, and has thus been the terminus for the light rail line U79, because the wider light rail vehicles could not use the tram line to Meiderich and Dinslaken. When the tunnel to Meiderich was opened in 2000, line U79 was extended to the new end of the Tunnel, Meiderich Bahnhof. The station The station consists of a platform and a mezzanine level. One entrance is on the south of the platform, the other in the center. The platform is divided in a high and a low part. The light rail vehicles of line U79 are high-floor trains, and thus stop at the high part. The trams of line 903 have a low-floor entrance and thus people cannot get on the train on high platforms, so this line stops at the low part. North of the station is a siding that can be used to reverse trains, as was done with U79 trains until 2000, before there also was a branch line to the tram route via a ramp.

History The establishment of the Jahangir Mahal dates back to the 17th century A.D. when the ruler of the region Vir Singh Deo built the structure as a symbol of warm reception of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, during the latter‚Äôs first visit to the city. The entrance of the Jahangir Mahal, Orchha is marked by an artistic and traditional gateway. The front wall of the structure faces to the east and is covered with turquoise tiles. Jahangir Mahal is a three-storied structure that is marked by stylishly hanging balconies, porches, and apartments. The domes of the Jahangir Mahal, were built according to Timurid customs; its grand Iwans are large enough to accommodate the entry of war elephants, and its high position over the landscape allowed cannons superior range. Conquest Akbar dispatched his most influential son, prince Jahangir, Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan and Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak to capture the city of Orchha, which was considered the center of the revolt. Jahangir arrived with a force of twelve thousand, and after many ferocious encounters and battles, subdued the kingdom of Bundela. Its rebellious ruler, Vir Singh Deo, surrendered to young Jahangir and agreed never to break an alliance with Akbar. Vir Singh Deo also relinquished control of over five thousand Bundela infantry and a thousand cavalry, weakening himself militarily. Vir Singh Deo later killed Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak in the year 1602, during Jahangir's succession to the Mughal throne, and remained a fugitive until his death. On 4 October 1635, the 16-year-old Aurangzeb raised the Mughal flag on the highest terrace of the Jahangir Mahal. After the Mughals won the Bundela War in 1635, Devi Singh was installed as the new administrator, and after the deaths of the rebel Jhujhar Singh and the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, was declared the sovereign of Bundela.

Under the direction of Mentessi, he participated in the creation of the Railway Workers Triptych in 1898 for the salon at the Societ√† Nazionale Mutuo Soccorso fra Ferrovieri e Lavoratori dei Trasporti in Milan. He was a socialist by persuasion and participated in the lively intellectual climate of the Famiglia Artistica, of which he was a member, exhibiting portraits and sanguine drawings at their annual exhibitions. From the beginning of the century until the 1920s, he was lucky enough to have the opportunity, together with Guido Zuccaro and Giovanni Buffa, to gain experience in the artistic stained glass company managed by Giovanni Beltrami. He participated regularly in the exhibitions of the Societ√† per le Belle Arti ed Esposizione Permanente and in the Brera exhibitions, including the 4th Triennale in 1900, where he won the Gavazzi Prize, and the Nazionale in 1906; in 1903 and 1905 he also showed works in the Esposizione Internazionale d‚ÄôArte di Venezia.

It is located southeast of Mount Baldy, northeast of Osoyoos. Several mines in the area led to the creation of Camp McKinney. The premier mine was called Cariboo-Amelia, usually referred to as the Cariboo. Al McKinney and Fred Rice staked a claim in 1888 which eventually became the Caribou Mine. Founded in 1896, Camp McKinney was situated on the south-eastern slopes of towering Mount Baldy. By 1901, the population of McKinney was 250. Hotels such as St. Louis, Sailor, Camp McKinney, McBoyle & West's, Cariboo and Miner's exchange competed for the miners' trade. The stagecoach of Hall line from Fairview and from the east came Meyerhoff's stage from Midway. The business section of town consisted of five saloons, three general stores, a drug store, a real estate office, butcher shop, a school and a church. \\"In 1901, 16,862 tons of ore yielded 9,439 ounces of gold bullion, and 428 tons of concentrates.\\" \\"Up until October, 1900, dividends of $478,087 were paid, and in 1902, $496,837.\\" However, gold mining declined in the area, the Cariboo Mine closed in December 1903 and Camp McKinney became a ghost town. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to revive the camp from 1907. Today, all that is left is a cemetery and a few abandoned workings. Lost gold bars On August 18, 1896, George B. McAulay of Spokane, Washington, one of the major shareholders in the Cariboo mine, left Camp McKinney for Midway. McAulay had three gold bricks valued at more than $10,000. He was robbed half an hour later on his way to Midway. Cariboo Mining Company posted a $3,000 reward for information leading to recovery of the gold bars. The bars were never recovered. It is believed the bars were hidden or buried somewhere in the area, close by Camp McKinney still waiting to be discovered.

Originally linked to the church at nearby Willingdon, it later became a separate parish church. The first building was destroyed by a bomb during World War II, and Edward Maufe was commissioned to design a replacement church; the hilltop building, finished in 1954, has been called \\"one of his most charming designs\\". English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History Until the early 19th century, the area covered by the present town of Eastbourne was thinly populated: there were four small settlements separated by farmland. The oldest, originally known as Bourne and now as the Old Town, was the site of the old parish church. Residential development was focused on the seafront until the start of the 20th century, when suburbs began to develop inland around the main roads and railway line. These were initially served by the ancient parish church of Willingdon, a village which was later surrounded by 20th-century housing. Housing developed near Hampden Park railway station (initially named Willingdon) after it opened in 1888. In June 1906, the vicar of Willingdon considered opening a chapel of ease to serve the area. He received support from Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon and his wife Marie: he gave land for the church and she arranged a fundraising concert which added ¬£200 (¬£ in ) to the building fund. The Marchioness laid the first stone of the chapel of ease on 2 May 1908, and it opened in November of that year. Architect William Hay Murray designed a Vernacular-style red- brick, stone and tile building with windows extending above the line of the eaves. Born in London, Murray had established an architectural practice in Hastings by 1874 and had apparently moved to Eastbourne by 1894. He designed or altered several Anglican churches in both towns. foundation stone of the original church survives, and is set in the wall near the new foundation stone laid in 1953. Attempts to make St Mary's Church independent of its mother church at Willingdon, thereby giving it parish church status in its own right, failed in 1939 because such changes had been suspended since the start of World War II. On 10 October 1940, a bombing raid by a Junkers Ju 88 destroyed the church: only the bell tower survived. A temporary building was put to use as a church by 1945, but a separate parish could still not be established because a permanent church building no longer existed. In December 1948, the Diocese of Chichester commissioned architect Edward Maufe to design a new church on the site. Known nationally for his work on Guildford Cathedral, he had already designed one new church in Sussex‚Äîthe Bishop Hannington Memorial Church in Hove (1938). Later he also designed the new St Nicholas' Church at Saltdean. Work started in 1952, and the new church was ready in 1954. At the same time, work on a long-planned church in The Hydneye, a suburban area east of the railway line, was taking place. Originally to have been dedicated to St Nicholas, it was later called St Peter's Church. It was within the new parish of St Mary's Church. Stained glass was installed in the east window of St Mary's in 1953: Moira Forsyth, daughter of ceramicist Gordon Forsyth, designed it. She had worked with Edward Maufe at Guildford Cathedral and elsewhere. Rev. Donald Carpenter, the first incumbent at the new church, served for 21 years and is commemorated by a clock on the south face of the tower. Restoration and improvement work was carried out on the interior and exterior between 2000 and 2006. Architecture The entrance is set in a deeply recessed pointed arch. St Mary's Church became one of the first postwar churches to gain listed status, and it has been praised for the \\"sculptural quality of its interior\\" and its \\"attractive\\" Perpendicular Gothic Revival form \\"refined by Maufe in a very personal way\\". Describing the style as \\"quintessential Maufe\\" featuring \\"the most distinctive elements of his personal style\\", architectural historian Elain Harwood called it \\"one of his most charming designs\\". The style is a simplified, unadorned interpretation of Perpendicular Gothic Revival with elements of the domestic Vernacular style‚Äîin particular in the treatment of the wood-framed nave windows. The plan comprises a nave with north and south aisles supported by buttresses, a chancel and sanctuary with an apsidal end, a bellcote at the northwest corner, a Lady chapel and an axially placed tower‚Äîan unusual style for Maufe‚Äîat the east end. The brick walls are painted white. The wide tower and the church's position on a low hill next to the park make it stand out from the surrounding houses. The roof has a shallow pitch and is laid with red pantiles. The tower, which has the memorial clock on one side, has two pointed-arched openings on each face. The straight-headed entrance is at the west end, set beneath an arch with decorative moulding. A large simplified lancet window is set into the pointed-arched recess above this. The interior is coated with greyish- white render, and the ceiling is painted pale blue. There is a gallery at the west end. A series of pointed concrete transverse arches form the arcades between the aisles and nave. They have square bases and lack mouldings or capitals, recalling Maufe's earlier (1934) St Thomas the Apostle's Church at Hanwell, London. Other internal features drew inspiration from Scandinavian architecture, including the H√∂galidskyrkan in Stockholm (by Ivar Tengbom) and the Stockholm City Hall by Ragnar √ñstberg. Each bay of the aisle has a square timber-framed leaded light window. Stone sedilia are placed in an arched recess near the central altar in the sanctuary, whose ceiling is decorated with stars. Fittings include a set of limed oak altar rails, a stone font with a wooden cover, and a stone and rendered pulpit attached to the side of the chancel arch. The church today St Peter's Church serves the Hydneye area of Hampden Park. St Mary's Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 25 September 1998. This defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". In February 2001, it was one of 100 Grade II listed buildings, and 109 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Eastbourne. Few postwar buildings have this status: English Heritage states that \\"post-1945 buildings have to be exceptionally important to be listed\\", as the criteria become stricter the newer a building is. The parish covers the suburb of Hampden Park in the north of Eastbourne. Its eastern boundary is formed by the railway line between Cross Levels Way and the edge of the urban area. Maywood Avenue, Lindfield Road and Maplehurst Road are the northern limits. The boundary then follows Willingdon Park Road and extends to the southwest as far as the Willingdon Road, then runs north of Eridge Road and Eastbourne District General Hospital. Now separately parished, but part of a joint benefice with St Mary's Church, is St Peter's Church in the Hydneye housing estate. Started in 1953 and completed in the 1970s, the brick church took the dedication of the former St Peter's Church in the Meads area of Eastbourne, which was demolished in 1971. Some stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe was taken from that church and installed in the new building. Worship is in the Modern Catholic style of the Anglican Church. Each Sunday there is a morning Holy Communion service using the Book of Common Prayer and (except on the fifth Sunday) another service later in the morning. Another Holy Communion service is held on Thursday mornings.

The station was located on a short branch off the Caledonian Railway line from Coatbridge to Larbert. (There were two other \\"Bonnybridge\\" stations, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow main line and the Kilsyth line respectively.) History Map of the Bonnybridge branchBonnybridge was a small town located west of Falkirk in central Scotland. The Forth and Clyde Canal was opened in 1790, and the access to transportation encouraged the development of industry locally. The town was located on the north side of the canal. By the second half of the nineteenth century there were a tile works with a short tramway to the canal, a sawmill, a dyeworks, a smithy and three flour mills. Potash extraction developed later.David Turnock, The Historical Geography of Scotland Since 1707, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1982, =Bonnybridge (High) railway station= When the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened on 1842, this initiated a major change in transport systems, and towns that were connected to the line found that their prosperity rose considerably, and those that were not suffered accordingly. The E&GR; line passed a mile or so to the south of the canal. The North British Railway took over the E&GR; in 1865, and in May 1870 it opened a Bonnybridge station on the E&GR; main line.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, This was of course somewhat remote from the town, and on the other side of the canal; access to cross the canal was by the so-called Radical Pend, and constricted tunnel under the canal which carried a watercourse to the Bonny Water. Fireclay and brick works developed in the area of the station itself. =Bonnybridge (Canal) railway station= The Scottish Central Railway (SCR) opened its main line in 1848, connecting at junctions at Greenhill with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway (E&GR;) and the Caledonian Railway. In the vicinity of Bonnybridge, the SCR route passed between the E&GR; main line and the canal. A station was provided at Greenhill Junction,The station was known by several similar names. but despite its location less than a mile away this was not convenient for Bonnybridge, being positioned on a road which had no bridge over the canal.Peter Marshall, The Scottish Central Railway: Perth to Stirling, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1998, The Caledonian Railway absorbed the SCR in 1865. The former SCR route passed closest of all railways to the town. There was pressure from local industry to provide a proper railway connection, and the Caledonian agreed to do so, opening a short branch line from Greenhill on 2 August 1886.Ross says (page 130) \\"the Caledonian rather sneakily laid [the branch]\\" but he does not explain why this was underhand.John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, On the south side of the canal, the line connected heavy industry which developed considerably, but the crossing under the canal was inconvenient, until a lift bridge was built in 1900. The passenger business from the Caledonian terminus never developed, although the iron foundries produced significant mineral flows. In 1922 the branch had two return passenger journeys daily,Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985 and the station closed to passenger traffic on 28 July 1930, although occasional excursion special trains operated from the station later, probably until 1938. The location was renamed Bonnybridge Canal Goods Depot after passenger closure, to distinguish it from the other Bonnybridge locations.Ross implies (page 130) that the \\"Canal\\" identifier was always in use, but this is not supported in Bradshaw or other sources.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, Railway Junction Diagrams 1915, David and Charles Reprints, Newton Abbot, 1969, The 1960 Sectional Appendix shows the line as 1,210 yards (1,106 m) in length with a permanent speed restriction of 10 mph (16 km/h).British Railways Scottish Region, Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetable and Books of Rules and Regulations, Section 2 - West, Glasgow, 1960 The goods and mineral traffic continued until complete closure of the branch on 7 December 1964.Gordon Stansfield, Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, 2002, =Bonnybridge (Central) railway station= A more convenient station for Bonnybridge was opened on 2 July 1888, when the Kilsyth and Bonnybridge Railway opened.

Historically, this research was inspired by the discovery that the Veneziano amplitude of the open bosonic string, which is calculated using an integral over the real numbers, can be generalized to the p-adic numbers. This observation initiated the study of p-adic string theory. Another approach considers particles in a p-adic potential well, with the goal of finding solutions with smoothly varying complex-valued wave functions. Alternatively, one can consider particles in p-adic potential wells and seek p-adic valued wave functions, in which case the problem of the probabilistic interpretation of the p-adic valued wave function arises. As there does not exist a suitable p-adic Schr√∂dinger equation, path integrals are employed instead. Some one- dimensional systems have been studied by means of the path integral formulation, including the free particle, the particle in a constant field, and the harmonic oscillator.

Lemmy Caution, although currently otherwise busy, is assigned to return the scientist. He is advised to start searching for him by finding in the first place Dr. Whitaker's attractive young fianc√©e Geraldine.

Plot summary The theme in the book is Pluterday, an extra day in the week which can be withdrawn if one saves enough time (e.g. by taking a plane instead of a train). Only the rich can save enough time and thus Pluterday is in practice reserved for the \\"happy few\\", resulting in a class society.

The site features remains of the city's Iron Age fortifications which were later incorporated into the Hasmonean city walls. It was excavated by Israeli archaeologist Nahman Avigad during the 1970s. Finds unearthed at the site attest to the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. Excavation Between 1969 and 1982 Nahman Avigad conducted extensive excavations in the Jewish Quarter, situated on Jerusalem's southwestern hill. These excavations, covering an area of some 5 acres, proved crucial for the understanding of the history of settlement in this section of the old city. In the northern part of the quarter, Avigad and his team uncovered three well- preserved segments of late Iron Age (First Temple Period) fortifications. One of these was the Israelite Tower, described as \\"one of the most impressive fortification remains from biblical times to have been found in the land of Israel\\". =Israelite Tower= Slightly north of the Broad Wall, excavations revealed two perpendicular walls about wide and surviving to a maximal height of . One is long, running from east to west, and the other long and runs from north to south. Standing on bedrock 45 feet below modern ground level, the walls were built of rough-hewn field stones placed in courses along both faces, with the spaces in-between filled with small stones. A surface of beaten earth tightly bonded to the tower, covered by ashes, produced Late Iron Age II sherds characteristic of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. Avigad identified the tower as the corner of a four-chambered gatehouse in Jerusalem's northern wall, perhaps the \\"Middle Gate\\" mentioned in . It had been built to protect the city's vulnerable northern perimeter, probably during the 8th century BCE but perhaps during the reign of Menasseh in the 7th century BCE. It is physically close to the Broad Wall, built during the reign of king Hezekiah, but appears to have come into use after the Broad Wall had already fallen into disuse. Finds at the tower attest to a battle. On the last day of the 1975 excavation season, Avigad's team unearthed four arrowheads buried in the layer of soot and ashes at the base of the tower. One was made of iron and the other three of bronze, including one distinguished from the others by three triangular fins and a hollow socket for the shaft. This was identified as a Scytho-Iranian type in widespread use by Babylonian archers after 600 BCE. As the pottery found within the conflagration layer is dated earlier than 586 BCE, the range of dates for the possible battle at the site is reduced significantly. The four arrowheads are therefore likely remnants of the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. They are thought to be the first remains ever recovered of the Babylonian siege, having come to rest in the ashes of the burning city, as described in . Avigad's discoveries also provided an answer to a contemporary debate about the extent of Iron Age Jerusalem. Before the excavation of the Jewish quarter, scholars had been divided between those that believed the city had been confined to its eastern ridge, including the Temple Mount and the City of David, and those who believed the biblical city has already expanded to encompass the southwestern hill. Avigad's discoveries, since augmented by additional finds, had proven that by the end of the First Temple period, Jerusalem's city walls had expanded to the Hinnom Valley in the west and had encompassed the entire southwestern hill. =Hasmonean Tower= Abutting and incorporating the Israelite Tower are the remains of another tower and city wall. Shaped like the Greek letter , the tower extends north from the wall. Constructed of medium-size, well-cut, close-fitting rectangular ashlars, the tower walls are long and between 2.5m and 3m thick. The masonry is characteristic of the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE, as is the pottery found on and below another surface bonded to the wall, 1.3 meters above the earlier 6th century floor. These have linked the later defences to the Hasmonean \\"First Wall\\", described in detail in Josephus' The Jewish War. Although Josephus erroneously attributes it to David, Solomon and the kings of Judah, construction of the wall was initiated by Jonathan Maccabeus and completed by his brother Simon during the 2nd century BCE. A nearby gap between fragments of the wall hints that another city gate stood at the site, possibly the Gennath gate also mentioned by Josephus. Access The Israelite Tower is located at the modern junction of Plugot HaKotel and Shonei HaLakhot streets, preserved underneath a school. Access is limited and requires reservation.

On 28 November 1952 with a crowd of several hundred onlookers, Roberts piloted a PBY Catalina to a perfect landing on the partially completed airport runway. Within six months after that landing, Roberts had acquired two used Lockheed Lodestar airliners purchased to keep up with the competition whose interest was now piqued by the soon-to-be completed airfield at George Town. Personal life In 1936, Roberts was married to Patricia Charles. Together, they were the parents of two daughters who lived in London: * Camilla Marguerite Roberts (d. 2017), who married Henry Crichton, 6th Earl Erne, a son of John Crichton, 5th Earl Erne and Lady Davidema Bulwer-Lytton (a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Lytton), in 1958. They divorced in 1980 and she married Anthony \\"Tony\\" Gray. * Lucinda Hilary Roberts, who married Demetri Marchessini in 1961. They divorced and in 1979, she married to Nicholas John Peto (b. 1939), son of Sir Christopher Peto, 3rd Baronet and Barbara (n√©e Close). They divorced in 1989. During a CIA flight from Kingston, Jamaica to Grand Cayman on 10 April 1953, the Lodestar piloted by Roberts crashed on takeoff from Palisadoes Airport, killing thirteen of the fourteen people onboard, including Roberts and his sister. The only survivor of the crash was Roberts' brother-in-law, Lt.-Col.

David Hume, Baron Hume of Ninewells FRSE (1757‚Äì1838) was a Scottish advocate, judge and legal scholar, whose work on Scots criminal law and Scots private law has had a deep and continuing influence. He is referred to as Baron Hume to distinguish him from his uncle, David Hume the philosopher. Hume was educated at the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh. He became an advocate in 1779, and in 1786 was appointed Professor of Scottish Law at the University of Edinburgh, a post he retained until 1822, when he took up office as a Baron of Exchequer. In 1785 he married Jane Alder. They had three sons and three daughters. Hume‚Äôs writings on criminal law culminated in his Commentaries on the Law of Scotland, Respecting Trial for Crimes (1797), a work that has continued to be cited in court into the 21st century. During his lifetime he never published his lectures on Scots private law, and indeed expressed the wish that they should not be published posthumously. But manuscript copies were widely circulated and were influential, sometimes being cited in court. Eventually they were published, in six volumes, between 1939 and 1958.Baron David Hume's Lectures, 1786‚Äì1822, ed by G. C. H. Paton. The result was a revival of their influence, not least in the field of property law.  Early life and education  David Hume was baptised 27 February 1757 at Chirnside, Berwickshire, a son of John Hume of Ninewells (1709‚Äì1786) and his wife, Agnes n√©e Carre (1725‚Äì1785); he was a nephew of the philosopher David Hume.John W. Cairns, \\"Hume, David (bap. 1757, d. 1838)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2007, accessed 22 Oct 2011. From 1765 to 1767, he was enrolled as a pupil at Edinburgh high school and then studied at the University of Edinburgh where, in 1774, he studied Roman Law. He matriculated as a law student at the University of Glasgow in 1775 where he remained until 1777 and lodged with Professor John Millar, \\"then the most celebrated law teacher in the British Isles.\\" In 1777 and 1778 he was a registered student of Scots law in Edinburgh.  Advocate, sheriff-depute, professor, baron  Hume was admitted as to the Faculty of Advocates in 1779. In 1783 he was favoured with the appointment as part-time sheriff-depute of Berwickshire. In December 1786, he added to these the chair in Scots law in the University of Edinburgh. In 1793 he left the sheriffdom of Berwickshire for that of Linlithgowshire. In 1811 he was made a principal clerk of session and resigned his post as sheriff. In 1822 Hume became Baron David Hume on his appointment as Baron of the Exchequer. When he resigned from his professorial post, the university awarded him the degree of LLD.  Family life  The grave of David Hume of Ninewells, Old Calton Cemetery On 24 February 1785 he married Jane Alder and they had three sons and three daughters.

S√∂dermanland Runic Inscription 239 or S√∂ 239 is the Rundata catalog listing for a Viking Age memorial runestone fragment that is located in H√§ringe, which is about one kilometer east of Landfj√§rden, Stockholm County, Sweden, which is in the historic province of S√∂dermanland. Description The damaged inscription on S√∂ 239, which is missing its upper section, is 1.4 meters in height and consists of runic text in the younger futhark that is carved on a serpent along the outer edge of the stone with a rider on a horse depicted in the center of the inscription. Several other Scandinavian runestones include depictions of horses, including DR 96 in √Ölum, N 61 in Alstad, S√∂ 101 in Ramsundsberget, S√∂ 226 in Norra Stutby, S√∂ 327 in G√∂ksten, U 375 in Vidbo, U 488 in Harg, U 599 in Hanunda, U 691 in S√∂derby, U 855 in B√∂ksta, U 901 in H√•m√∂, U 935 at the Uppsala Cathedral, and U 1003 in Fr√∂tuna. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns, with the animal heads typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. Based on stylistic analysis, S√∂ 239 has been attributed to a runemaster with the normalized name of Halvdan, who was active in the mid-11th century in S√∂dermanland and signed the inscription S√∂ 270 in Tyresta. Over fifteen other runestones have been attributed to him, including S√∂ 235 in V√§sterby, S√∂ 237 in Fors, S√∂ 244 in Tuna, S√∂ 245 in Tungelsta, the now-lost S√∂ 247 in √Ölsta, S√∂ 252 in S√§by, S√∂ 256 in √Ñlby, S√∂ 262 in Blista, S√∂ 269 in S√∂derby Malm, S√∂ 272 in Upp-Norrby, S√∂ 274 in S√∂dersluss, S√∂ 290 in Farsta, S√∂ 292 in Br√∂ta, S√∂ 297 in Uppinge, S√∂ 298 in Uringe Malm, and S√∂ 301 in √Ögesta Bro. S√∂ 239 was noted in the early 1800s, and was found during an inspection in 1865 with the inscription side face-down. The stone was erected in 1897 east of the entrance to the H√§ringe slott, a Swedish castle. The remaining runic text on this fragment, which appears to follow the memorial formula typical on runestones of this period, suggests that the sponsor of the runestone was a man named Bj√¥rn who raised the stone in memory of his brother Ulfr. Similar to his other inscriptions, Halvdan used a word divider punctuation mark between each word of the surviving text.

The home was once owned by a Florida State Congressman (William O Williams) and a Mayor (Rupert Charles McClellan). W.O Williams (1873‚Äì1920) was a Florida Congressman elected to the House of Representatives in 1918-1919. In addition, the home was owned by R.C.

McClellan, (1808‚Äì1866) a delegate of the Florida Constitutional Convention in 1838, which drafted Florida's constitution and bill of rights, leading the territory of Florida into statehood in 1845. This Queen Anne Victorian home was later owned by George M. Heath, (1872‚Äì1942) who purchased the home in 1935. The Heath family sold the home in 1979, and by 2010, it was in major disrepair and at risk of being demolished.

The organization creates web technologies as a key tool for gathering, organizing, illustrating and sharing information through the web, working to promote informed citizen actions and government accountability. Under the umbrella of Fundaci√≥n Ciudadan√≠a Inteligente, there are several ongoing projects. The web platform, Vota Inteligente (Vote Smartly), hosts different applications and tools that give access to information for the general public.  History  Fundaci√≥n Ciudadano Inteligente was registered as a non-governmental organization in Chile on December 22, 2009. Fundaci√≥n Ciudadano Inteligente is the current Fundaci√≥n Ciudadan√≠a Inteligente ( was started on December 28, 2009, by its Founding Directors; Felipe Heusser, Erich Schnake, Rodrigo Saffirio, Rodrigo Mobarec, Sebastian Echeverria, Alfonso Tapia, Juan Covarrubias, Pablo Carvacho, Boris De Los Rios, Valentina Insulza, and Milenko Bertrand- Galindo. Vota Inteligente was publicly launched on October 22 of that same year in preparation for the Chilean Presidential elections. The first drafts of the organization‚Äôs mission focused on the promotion of transparency and social accountability. Web technology later also became an essential element to the organization, mainly due to the influence of other organizations that had already successfully been using the internet to pursue transparency and accountability.  Funding and finance  The Open Society Institute finances 90% of Fundaci√≥n Ciudadano Inteligente‚Äôs annual operations. The other 10% of finances come from grants such as those from the World Bank Institute, the Prix Ars Electronica Award, and recently, the Omidyar Network.  Vota Inteligente  Vota Inteligente is the main initiative of Fundaci√≥n Ciudadan√≠a Inteligente. Through Vota Inteligente, Chilean citizens are able to access all up to date information on Congressional actions and activities in one place. The site contains information on how Congress works, including how a bill is passed, information on its structure and the current party composition of Parliamentarians. Vota Inteligente‚Äôs main work is to track bills being debated within Congress ‚Äì more specifically in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate ‚Äì providing updated information not only regarding the content of the bill itself but also presenting the bill‚Äôs development and status, dimensions of debate, support and opposition of Parliamentary members, potential conflicts of interest and investments on issues, in both plenary and committee levels of Congress.  Other projects  In addition to the main project, Vota Inteligente, the following projects are ongoing within Ciudadan√≠a Inteligente: Acceso Inteligente (Smart Access) is an online freedom of information management system for Chilean citizens, Promesas 21 de Mayo (Government Promises of May 21) is a graphic analysis and follow-up of presidential electoral promises, Se√±al Alo (Hi Sign) an online visualization of telecommunication antennas with a strategic design. Donar (Donate) is a tool modeled, that promotes donations to civil society organizations in Chile, making the donation process transparent and easily accessible for both Chileans and the NGOs on the site. The site, ¬øHay Acuerdo? (Is there Agreement?) breaks down the current ongoing debate between Chilean students and the Pi√±era administration. Globo Ciudadano (Citizen‚Äôs Balloon) is a project that live streams protests in Chile on its website, using balloon mapping.  Awards  In September 2011, the organization received an international award from PrixArs Electronica, International Competition for the Arts. It was one of six winners selected out of more than 3,600 projects and 74 countries.

NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC provides overall guidance and political leadership to the agency. There are 10 NASA field centers, which provide leadership for and execution of NASA's work. All other facilities fall under the leadership of at least one of these field centers. Some facilities serve more than one application for historic or administrative reasons. NASA has used or supported various observatories and telescopes, and an example of this is the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. In 2013 a NASA Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) Report recommended a Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) style organization to consolidate NASA's little used facilities. The OIG determined at least 33 of NASA's 155 facilities were underutilized.  List of field centers NASA has ten field centers. Four of these were inherited from its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA); two others were transferred to NASA from the United States Army; and NASA commissioned and built the other four itself shortly after its formation in 1958. =Inherited from NACA= Langley Research Center Langley Research Center (LaRC), founded in 1917, is the oldest of NASA's field centers, located in Hampton, Virginia. LaRC focuses primarily on aeronautical research, though the Apollo lunar lander was flight-tested at the facility and a number of high-profile space missions have been planned and designed on- site. Established in 1917 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the Center currently devotes two-thirds of its programs to aeronautics, and the rest to space. LaRC researchers use more than 40 wind tunnels to study improved aircraft and spacecraft safety, performance, and efficiency. Starting in 1958, when NASA started Project Mercury, LaRC housed the Space Task Group, which was expanded into the Manned Spacecraft Center and moved to Houston in 1961‚Äì1962. The selection of Houston as the location of the Manned Spacecraft Center resulted in some controversy at NASA Langley and in the surrounding area at the time, given they had previously expected either for Langley to be expanded or for a nearby location in the Hampton Roads region to be selected for the center. Ames Research Center wind tunnels Ames Research Center (ARC) at Moffett Field was founded on December 20, 1939. The center was named after Joseph Sweetman Ames, a founding member of the NACA. ARC is one of NASA's 10 major field centers and is located in California's Silicon Valley. Historically, Ames was founded to do wind-tunnel research on the aerodynamics of propeller-driven aircraft; however, it has expanded its role to doing research and technology in aeronautics, spaceflight, and information technology. It provides leadership in astrobiology, small satellites, robotic lunar exploration, intelligent/adaptive systems and thermal protection. John H. Glenn Research Center (GRC), formerly the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, located in Brook Park, Ohio, was established in 1942 as a laboratory for aircraft engine research. In 1999, the center was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field after John Glenn, an American fighter pilot, astronaut and politician. Glenn supports all of the agency's missions and major programs. Glenn excels in researching and developing innovative technologies for both aeronautics and space flight. A multitude of NASA missions have included elements from Glenn, from the Mercury and Gemini projects to the Space Shuttle Program and the International Space Station. The center's core competencies include air-breathing and in-space propulsion and cryogenics, communications, power energy storage and conversion, microgravity sciences, and advanced materials. Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC), established by NACA before 1946 and located inside Edwards Air Force Base, is NASA's premier site for aeronautical research and operates some of the most advanced aircraft in the world. It is also the home of the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), a modified Boeing 747 designed to carry a Space Shuttle orbiter back to Kennedy Space Center if one lands at Edwards. On January 16, 2014, the center previously known as Dryden was renamed in honor of Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to walk on the Moon. =Transferred from the Army= Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), located in the San Gabriel Valley area of Los Angeles County, CA, was, together with ABMA, one of the agencies behind Explorer 1, America's first robotic satellite, and also together with ABMA one of the first agencies to become a part of NASA. The facility is headquartered in the city of La Ca√±ada Flintridge https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/science/20160713/why-does-everyone-say-nasas- jpl-is-in-pasadena-when-this-other-city-is-its-real-home https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/about/maps/ with a Pasadena mailing address . JPL is managed by the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The Laboratory's primary function is the construction and operation of robotic planetary spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network. George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), located on the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Alabama, is one of NASA's largest centers. MSFC is where the Saturn V rocket and Spacelab were developed. Marshall is NASA's lead center for International Space Station (ISS) design and assembly; payloads and related crew training; and was the lead for Space Shuttle propulsion and its external tank. From December 1959, it contained the Launch Operations Directorate, which moved to Florida to become the Launch Operations Center on July 1, 1962. =Built by NASA= Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), located in Greenbelt, Maryland, was commissioned by NASA on March 1, 1959. It is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the United States dedicated to increasing knowledge of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe via observations from space. GSFC is a major U.S. laboratory for developing and operating unmanned scientific spacecraft. GSFC conducts scientific investigation, development and operation of space systems, and development of related technologies. Goddard scientists can develop and support a mission, and Goddard engineers and technicians can design and build the spacecraft for that mission. Goddard scientist John C. Mather shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on COBE. GSFC also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the Space Network and the Near Earth Network), develops and maintains advanced space and Earth science data information systems, and develops satellite systems for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). John C. Stennis Space Center, originally the Mississippi Test Facility, is located in Hancock County, Mississippi, on the banks of the Pearl River at the Mississippi‚ÄìLouisiana border. Commissioned on October 25, 1961, it was NASA's largest rocket engine test facility until the end of the Space Shuttle program. It is currently used for rocket testing by over 30 local, state, national, international, private, and public companies and agencies. It contains the NASA Shared Services Center. Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's center for human spaceflight training, research and flight control. Created as the Manned Spacecraft Center on November 1, 1961, the facility consists of a complex of 100 buildings constructed in 1962‚Äì1963 on 1,620 acres (656 ha) of land donated by Rice University in Houston, Texas. The center grew out of the Space Task Group formed soon after the creation of NASA to co-ordinate the US human spaceflight program. It is home to the United States Astronaut Corps and is responsible for training astronauts from the U.S. and its international partners, and includes the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center. The center was renamed in honor of the late U.S. president and Texas native Lyndon B. Johnson on February 19, 1973. John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), located west of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, is one of the best known NASA facilities. Named the Launch Operations Center at its creation on July 1, 1962, it was renamed in honor of the late U.S. president on November 29, 1963, and has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at Cape Canaveral. Its Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the fourth-largest structure in the world by volume and was the largest when completed in 1965. A total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011. Approximately 2,100 are employees of the federal government; the rest are contractors. Other facilities Canberra Deep Space Communication, Australia Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) is a ground station that is located in Australia at Tidbinbilla outside Canberra. The complex is part of the Deep Space Network run by JPL. It is commonly referred to as the Tidbinbilla Deep Space Tracking Station and was officially opened on 19 March 1965. The station is separated from Canberra by the Coolamon Ridge, Urambi Hills and Bullen Range that help shield the city's radio frequency (RF) noise from the dishes. In addition to JPL (above), there are other Government- Owned / Contractor-Operated NASA facilities operated under grant provisions, such as the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns Hopkins University which operates the Hubble Space Telescope.

In 2020, Amanfu was nominated for the Grammy Award for Song of the Year for co-writing \\"Hard Place\\" by H.E.R.. Amanfu has released seven studio albums and multiple singles. She is well known for being one half of the duo Sam & Ruby, whose album was named Associated Press Album of the Year in 2009. Amanfu is also known for her collaborations with Jack White in his all-female band, The Peacocks, and has widely appeared on his critically acclaimed solo albums, Blunderbuss and Lazaretto. Outside of her musical career, Ruby is an actress, civil activist, an elected Recording Academy Board Governor, private chef, and food blogger. Early life and education Ruby Amanfu was born in Accra, Ghana to a tight-knit musical family of five. When she was three years old, her father moved the family to Nashville, Tennessee, where from an early age she flourished among the sights and sounds of the Music City. She entered and won her first school talent show in the third grade with an original song she wrote during recess. Entering many literary competitions in middle and high school, Amanfu honed her lyric and creative writing skills. She was educated in the private and magnet school systems and attended Hume-Fogg Academic Magnet High School, whose premiere Fine Arts program afforded her an on-site studio where she had the opportunity to write and record her own songs. In her second year of high school, Amanfu was chosen for The Nashville Symphony Chorus, becoming the youngest member to join the group. She attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts until she transferred to Belmont University in hometown Nashville, Tennessee. Career =Beginnings= During high school, Amanfu was introduced to Nashville-based philanthropic couple, Dave and Becky Matthews. The Matthews' took interest in Amanfu's songwriting and supported her first full-length album, So Now The Whole World Knows, with Dave at the helm as engineer and co-producer with Amanfu. The LP was fully recorded at The Matthews' home studio by the time Amanfu finished high school. Shortly after the release of So Now The Whole World Knows, Amanfu signed to independent record label Spongebath Records. She began working with Grammy nominated singer-songwriter, Tommy Sims, co-author of Eric Clapton‚Äôs Change the World. Sims produced and co-wrote Amanfu's first hit single, \\"Sugah\\".

Amanfu and Brooker began to co-write another set of songs in 2004. The pair was invited by friend and musician, Dan Dyer, to open for him at Saxon Pub in Austin, TX during South by Southwest. Amanfu and Brooker became Sam & Ruby, and went on to complete a collection of songs that became their first self-titled EP.

Biography He graduated from Columbia in 1862, and then studied chemistry with Jean Baptiste Andr√© Dumas and Charles Adolphe Wurtz in Paris; with Robert Bunsen, Hermann Kopp, and Gustav Kirchhoff at Heidelberg; with Friedrich W√∂hler at G√∂ttingen; and with August Wilhelm von Hofmann in Berlin, and received a D. Phil. at G√∂ttingen in 1866, for his work called \\"On the Fluorine Compounds of Uranium\\". The rest of the issue is also about Bolton and his works. After his graduation, he spent some years in travel. From 1872 until 1877, he was assistant in quantitative analysis in the Columbia School of Mines. In 1874 he was appointed professor of chemistry in the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary. He resigned in 1877, when he became professor of chemistry and natural science in Trinity College. The celebration of the centennial of chemistry at Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the home of Joseph Priestley, who discovered oxygen in 1774, was suggested and brought about by Bolton. Among his investigations, that of the action of organic acids on minerals is perhaps the most important, but most of his work was literary, and his private collection of early chemical books was unsurpassed in the United States. Bolton published large bibliographies of chemistry and later of all scientific periodicals which are still used. He included alchemy in the chemistry listings and emphasized the continuity of the transition. He was a member of many scientific societies, perhaps more than any contemporary. The rest of the issue is also about Bolton and his works. The Science History Institute hosts the Bolton Society, which is named for H.C. Bolton, to support \\"printed materials devoted to chemistry and related sciences\\" and to support its Othmer Library of Chemical History.

Its innovative program integrates the use of technology in the development and implementation of personalized curriculum and learning as well as the use of technology in the learning environment.Philissa Cramer in Gotham Schools, 2009-07-21, retrieved online 2011-06-22NY Convergence: NYC School of One, a Hybrid Between Teachers and Technology, retrieved online 2011-09-25Education Week article 2011-03-17, retrieved online 2011-09-25 Educational approach The program is a pioneer in a new method of education based on each student's individual learning requirements, also called learner-based-learning or student-centred learning. The approach is to provide students with their own personal learning environment. In traditional learning environments, teachers lead students through the curriculum such that each student is expected to learn the same material at the same time. At SO1, each student is provided a blended learning environment geared towards their individual learning needs. These are identified by State assessments and test results and are then used to create a student's ‚Äúplaylist,‚Äù or individual learning plan. Each student receives a unique daily schedule based on their own learning needs and strengths, with each schedule and instruction plan adjusted to suit their ability and most successful learning method. Teachers can acquire real-time data on each student's achievement and adjust their live instruction to suit, usually daily.Future Schools: Education Next, retrieved online 2011-09-25 The SO1 focuses on learning progression, but depending on pre-identified skills of the students, each student might begin the same lesson at a different point. Each student participates in multiple instructional methods, including teacher-led instruction, small group collaboration, individual tutoring, independent learning, work with online tutors, or any combination thereof.Groundbreaking \\"School of One\\" is Prototype for 21st Century Instruction, NYC DOE, 2009-07-21, retrieved online 2011-05-05Arthur E.

These stations provide the lessons selected by the curriculum software as well as connecting students with a teacher, software, and online tutors. This allows the student to work independently or in collaboration with other online students, either individually or in groups. The student-teacher ratio is 10, significantly lower than in most programs.Philissa Cramer in Gotham Schools, 2009-07-21, retrieved online 2011-06-22 Technology The School of One uses digital technology to develop individualized, daily- adjusted student curricula which the students access via an online portal. A computer-based learning algorithm collects data to generate a daily lesson plan or \\"playlist\\" for each student based on what is determined to best meet their learning needs. It functions as an adaptive scheduler to ensure each student is learning in his or her educational \\"sweet spot.\\" As it collects data, the algorithm generates a daily lesson plan and schedule for each student and teacher by analyzing factors including each student's academic history and profile, assessment of previous work sessions, as well as the school's available resources, space, and staffing. Teachers can review and suggest changes to the algorithm's daily lesson recommendations to provide additional pedagogical direction, input and feedback.

Key results from the charrette:The American Architectural Foundation, School of One Design Charrette, retrieved online 2011-09-25 * The student is a key stakeholder. The effectiveness of the School of One will depend on the end-user's experience. * Different learning modalities require different spaces. * Flexible spaces with reconfigurable furnishings can alleviate the need for additional square footage. * Data on the user experience will inform the link between motivation and design of the learning environment. * Technology is a pathway, not an end result. Delivery mechanisms constantly evolve and replace earlier models. * Design is a change agent. The design process can help solve problems holistically. The physical result was a design with different sized spaces, many smaller than traditional classrooms, with movable furniture offering flexible learning environments that can be adapted to different uses. There were fewer walls separating learning spaces, resulting in a more open plan plan. Acoustical separation was found to not be a major concern due to the students' being more actively engaged by their personalized learning.Charles Linn, School of One, Architectural Record Schools of the 21st Century, retrieved online 2011-09-25 Each student begins their day in a central gathering space with monitors similar to those in airport terminals directing students to their workstations.

Her music is noted for its stylized, cinematic quality; themes of sadness, tragic romance, glamor, and melancholia; and references to pop culture, particularly 1950s and 1960s Americana. Born in New York City and raised in upstate New York, Del Rey returned to New York City in 2005 to begin her music career. Following numerous projects, including her self-titled debut studio album, Del Rey's breakthrough came with the viral success of her debut single \\"Video Games\\" in 2011. She signed with Interscope and Polydor later that year. Her major label debut, Born to Die (2012), was an international success and spawned a top-ten single \\"Summertime Sadness\\" on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the singles \\"Blue Jeans\\" and \\"Born to Die\\", which charted in several overseas territories. Del Rey released the EP Paradise in 2012. The next year, Del Rey ventured into film, writing and starring in the music short film Tropico; she released \\"Young and Beautiful\\" as the lead single for the romantic drama film The Great Gatsby (2013).

Life and career =1985‚Äì2004: Early life= Del Rey was born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant on June 21, 1985; ; in Manhattan, New York City, to Robert England Grant, Jr., a Grey Group copywriter, and Patricia Ann \\"Pat\\" (n√©e Hill), an account executive at Grey Group. She has one younger sister, Caroline, and one younger brother, Charlie. She was raised Roman Catholic and is of Scottish descent. Her ancestors were from Lanarkshire. When she was one year old, the family moved to the upstate New York town of Lake Placid. In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor; her mother worked as a schoolteacher. There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor. She attended the high school where her mother taught for one year, but when she was 15 her parents sent her to Kent School to resolve a budding drinking problem. Her uncle, an admissions officer at the boarding school, secured her financial aid to attend. According to Grant, she had trouble making friends throughout much of her teenage and early adult years. She elaborated on being preoccupied with death from a young age, and its role in her feelings of anxiety and alienation: After graduating from the Kent School, she spent a year living on Long Island with her aunt and uncle and working as a waitress. During this time, Grant's uncle taught her how to play guitar, and she \\"realized [that she] could probably write a million songs with those six chords.\\" Shortly after, she began writing songs and performing in nightclubs around the city under various names such as \\"Sparkle Jump Rope Queen\\" and \\"Lizzy Grant and the Phenomena\\". \\"I was always singing, but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously\\", she said. \\"When I got to New York City when I was eighteen, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn‚ÄîI have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point‚Äîand that was it.\\" =2005‚Äì2010: Career beginnings= In fall of 2004, at age 19, Grant enrolled at Fordham University in The Bronx where she majored in philosophy, with an emphasis on metaphysics. She has said she chose to study the subject because it \\"bridged the gap between God and science... I was interested in God and how technology could bring us closer to finding out where we came from and why.\\" In the spring of 2005, while still in college, Del Rey registered a seven-track extended play with the United States Copyright Office; the application title was Rock Me Stable with another title Young Like Me also listed. A second extended play, titled From the End, was also recorded under Del Rey's stage name at the time, May Jailer. Between 2005 and 2006, she recorded an acoustic album titled Sirens under the May Jailer project, which later leaked on the internet in mid-2012. At her first public performance in 2006, for the Williamsburg Live Songwriting Competition, Del Rey met Van Wilson, an A&R; representative for 5 Points Records, an independent label owned by David Nichtern. In 2007, while a senior at Fordham, she submitted a demo tape of acoustic tracks titled No Kung Fu to 5 Points, who offered her a recording contract for $10,000. She used the money to relocate to Manhattan Mobile Home Park, a trailer park in North Bergen, New Jersey, and subsequently began working with producer David Kahne. Executive Nichtern recalled: \\"Our plan was to get it all organized and have a record to go and she‚Äôd be touring right after she graduated from college. Like a lot of artists, she morphed. When she first came to us, she was playing plunky little acoustic guitar, [had] sort of straight blonde hair, very cute young woman. A little bit dark, but very intelligent. We heard that. But she very quickly kept evolving.\\" Film actress Lana Turner (pictured) inspired Del Rey's stage name. Del Rey graduated from Fordham with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 2008, after which she released a three-track EP titled Kill Kill in October as Lizzy Grant, featuring production from Kahne. She explained that \\"David asked to work with me only a day after he got my demo. He is known as a producer with a lot of integrity and who had an interest in making music that wasn't just pop.\\" Meanwhile, Del Rey was working doing community outreach work for the homeless and drug addicts; she had become interested in community service work in college, when she had helped paint homes on an Indian reservation in Utah. On choosing a stage name for her feature debut album, she said: \\"I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba ‚Äì Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.\\" The name was also inspired by actress Lana Turner and the Ford Del Rey sedan, produced and sold in Brazil in the 1980s. Initially she had chosen the alternate spelling of Lana Del Ray, the name under which her self-titled debut album was released in January 2010. Her father helped with the marketing of the album, which was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn in April 2010. Kahne, as well as previous label owner Nichtern both stated that Del Rey bought the rights back from the label, 5 Points, as she wanted it out of circulation to \\"stifle future opportunities to distribute it‚Äîan echo of rumors the action was part of a calculated strategy.\\" Del Rey met her managers, Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, three months after Lana Del Ray was released, and they helped her get out of her contract with 5 Points Records, where, in her opinion, \\"nothing was happening.\\" Shortly after, she moved to London, and moved in with Mawson \\"for a few years.\\" On September 1, 2010, Del Rey was featured by Mando Diao in their MTV Unplugged concert at Union Film-Studios in Berlin. The same year, she acted in a short film titled Poolside, which she made with several friends. =2011‚Äì2013: Breakthrough with Born to Die and Paradise= Del Rey performing at the Bowery Ballroom in December 2011 In 2011, Del Rey uploaded self-made music videos for her songs \\"Video Games\\" and \\"Blue Jeans\\" to YouTube, featuring vintage footage interspersed with shots of her singing on her webcam. The \\"Video Games\\" music video became a viral internet sensation, which led to Del Rey being signed by Stranger Records to release the song as her debut single. She told The Observer: \\"I just put that song online a few months ago because it was my favorite. To be honest, it wasn't going to be the single but people have really responded to it.\\" The song earned her a Q award for \\"Next Big Thing\\" in October 2011 and an Ivor Novello for \\"Best Contemporary Song\\" in 2012. In the same month, she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to release her second studio album Born to Die. Del Rey performed two songs from the album on Saturday Night Live on January 14, 2012, and received a negative response from various critics and the general public, who deemed the performance uneven and vocally shaky. She had earlier defended her spot on the program, saying: \\"I'm a good musician ... I have been singing for a long time, and I think that [SNL creator] Lorne Michaels knows that ... it's not a fluke decision.\\" Born to Die was released on January 31, 2012, worldwide, and reached number one in 11 countries, although critics were divided. The same week, she announced she had bought back the rights to her 2010 debut album and had plans to re-release it in the summer of 2012 under Interscope Records and Polydor. Contrary to Del Rey's press statement, her previous record label and producer David Kahne have both stated that she bought the rights to the album when she and the label parted company, due to the offer of a new deal, in April 2010. Born to Die sold 3.4 million copies in 2012, making it the fifth-best-selling album of 2012. In the United States, Born to Die charted on the Billboard 200 well into 2012, lingering at number 76, after 36 weeks on the chart. Paris Motor Show endorsing the Jaguar F-Type in 2012 In September 2012, Del Rey unveiled the Jaguar F-Type at the Paris Motor Show. Adrian Hallmark, Jaguar's global brand director, explained their choice, saying Del Rey had \\"a unique blend of authenticity and modernity.\\" She also recorded the song \\"Burning Desire\\", which appeared in a promotional short film for the vehicle. In late September 2012, a music video for Del Rey's cover version of \\"Blue Velvet\\" was released as a promotional single for the H&M; 2012 autumn campaign, which Del Rey also modeled for in print advertising. On September 25, Del Rey released the single \\"Ride\\" in promotion of her upcoming EP, Paradise. She subsequently premiered the music video for \\"Ride\\" at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, California on October 10, 2012. Some critics panned the video for being allegedly pro- prostitution and antifeminist, due to Del Rey's portrayal of a prostitute in a biker gang. Paradise was released on November 12, 2012 as a standalone release, as well as Born to Die: The Paradise Edition, which combined Del Rey's previous album with the additional eight tracks on Paradise. Paradise marked Del Rey's second top 10 album in the United States, debuting at number 10 on the Billboard 200 with 67,000 copies sold in its first week. It was also later nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. Del Rey received several nominations at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards in November and won the award for Best Alternative performer. At the Brit Awards in February 2013, she won the award for International Female Solo Artist, followed by two Echo Award wins, in the categories of Best International Newcomer and Best International Pop/Rock Artist. Over the next several months, she released videos of two cover songs: one of Leonard Cohen's \\"Chelsea Hotel#2\\", followed by a duet with her then-boyfriend, Barrie-James O'Neil, of Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra's \\"Summer Wine\\". In May 2013, Del Rey released an original song, \\"Young and Beautiful\\" for the soundtrack of the 2013 film adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Following the song's release, it peaked at 22 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, shortly after its release to contemporary hit radio, the label prematurely pulled it and decided to send a different song to that format; on July 2, 2013, a Cedric Gervais remix of Del Rey's \\"Summertime Sadness\\" was sent there; a sleeper hit, the song proved to be a success, surpassing \\"Young and Beautiful\\", reaching number 6 and becoming her first American top ten hit. The remix won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical in 2013, while \\"Young and Beautiful\\" was nominated for Best Song Written for Visual Media. In June 2013, Del Rey filmed Tropico, a musical short film paired to tracks from Paradise, directed by Anthony Mandler. Del Rey screened the film on December 4, 2013 at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. On December 6, the soundtrack was released on digital outlets. =2014‚Äì2016: Ultraviolence, Honeymoon, and film work= Coachella Festival in 2014 On January 26, 2014, Del Rey released a cover of \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" for the 2014 dark fantasy film Maleficent.

Ultraviolence was released on June 13, 2014, and debuted at number one in 12 countries, including the United States and United Kingdom. The album, which sold 880,000 copies worldwide in its first week, was preceded by the singles \\"West Coast\\", \\"Shades of Cool\\", \\"Ultraviolence\\", and \\"Brooklyn Baby\\". Del Rey described the album as being \\"more stripped down but still cinematic and dark,\\" while some critics characterized the record as psychedelic and desert rock-influenced, more prominently featuring guitar instrumentation than her previous releases. Later that year, Del Rey contributed the songs \\"Big Eyes\\" and \\"I Can Fly\\" to Tim Burton's 2014 biographical film Big Eyes. Honeymoon, Del Rey's fourth studio album, was released on September 18, 2015 to acclaim from music critics.

In January 2018, Del Rey announced that she was in a lawsuit with British rock band Radiohead over alleged similarities between their song \\"Creep\\" and her song \\"Get Free\\". Following her announcement, legal representatives from their label Warner/Chappell denied the lawsuit, as well as Del Rey's claims of the band asking for \\"100% of the song's royalties\\".

Artistry =Musical style= Upon her debut release, Del Rey's music was described as \\"Hollywood sadcore\\" by some music critics. It has been repeatedly noted for its cinematic sound and its references to various aspects of pop culture; both critics and Del Rey herself have noted a persistent theme of 1950s and 1960s Americana. The strong elements of American nostalgia brought Idolator to classify her firmly as alternative pop. Del Rey elaborated on her connection to the past in an interview with Artistdirect, saying \\"I wasn't even born in the '50s but I feel like I was there.\\" Associated with several styles, Del Rey's music has been tagged broadly as pop, rock, dream pop or baroque pop, and has also been described as indie pop and psychedelic rock (especially on particular releases), linked to indie music, and trip hop, and often touching on styles such as hip hop, lo-fi, and trap. Of Born to Die, indie music journal Drowned in Sound wrote, \\"She likes that whole hip hop thing though, has this whole swagger thing going that not many girls like her got\\", adding that it sounded like a poppier Bond soundtrack. Del Rey's subsequent releases would introduce variant styles, particularly Ultraviolence, which employed a guitar-based sound akin to psychedelic and desert rock. Kenneth Partridge of Billboard noted this shift in style, writing: \\"She sings about drugs, cars, money, and the bad boys she's always falling for, and while there remains a sepia-toned mid-century flavor to many of these songs, [Del Rey] is no longer fronting like a thugged-out Bette Davis.\\" Upon the release of Honeymoon, one reviewer characterized Del Rey's body of work as being \\"about music as a time warp, with her languorous croons over molasses-like arrangements meant to make clock hands seem to move so slowly that it feels possible, at times, they might go backwards.\\" Prior to coming to prominence under the stage name Lana Del Rey, she performed under the names Lizzy Grant, Lana Rey Del Mar, Sparkle Jump Rope Queen, and May Jailer. Under the stage name Lizzy Grant, she referred to her music as \\"Hawaiian glam metal\\", while the work of her May Jailer project was acoustic. =Influences= Del Rey cites a wide array of musical artists as influences, including numerous pop, jazz, and blues performers from the mid-twentieth century, such as Andrew Lloyd Webber, Frank Sinatra, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, Bobby Vinton, The Crystals, and Miles Davis. Torch singers Julie London and Julee Cruise have also served as influences. \\"[I really] just like the masters of every genre\\", she told BBC radio presenter Jo Whiley in 2012, specifically naming Nirvana, Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley. Several rock musicians and groups from the late-twentieth century have also inspired Del Rey, such as Bruce Springsteen, Britney Spears, singer-songwriter Lou Reed, and rock band The Eagles, as well as folk musicians such as Leonard Cohen and Joan Baez. Del Rey has also cited contemporary artists such as singer-songwriter Cat Power, Hole frontwoman Courtney Love, rapper Eminem, and singer Amy Winehouse, as artists she looked up to. Her favorite films, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and American Beauty have also inspired her musical style. She has also stated that actress Lauren Bacall is someone she admires. Inspired by poetry, Del Rey cites Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg as instrumental to her songwriting. Del Rey has also cited film directors David Lynch and Federico Fellini, and the painters Mark Ryden and Pablo Picasso as influences. =Voice and timbre= Del Rey possesses an expansive contralto vocal range, which spans three-plus octaves and has been described as captivating and highly emotive, ranging from high notes in a girlish timbre to jazzy ornaments in her lower gesture with great ease. Following the release of Ultraviolence, which was recorded live in single takes and lacking Pro Tools vocal editing, critics fell into favor with Del Rey's vocal ability, praising her large range, increased vocal confidence, and uniquely emotive delivery. When recording in the studio Del Rey is known for vocal multi-layering, which, as it has been noted, is difficult for her to replicate within a live setting, especially with the lack of backing singers to fill out the original vocal style. Stage fright has also been noted as a major contribution to Del Rey's struggles with live performances. However, journalists noted in 2014 that her live performances had increased in confidence. Billboard deemed the Coachella debut of \\"West Coast\\" to be a \\"star-making performance\\" and lauded the singer's vocal abilities. Contemporary music critics have called her voice \\"smoky\\", \\"gravelly\\", and reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe. Upon the 2015 release of Honeymoon, her voice was compared by Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood to those of Julee Cruise and Eartha Kitt. Del Rey started the use of her lower vocals on the tracks from Born to Die, claiming that \\"people weren't taking me very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out. Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway\\". \\"I sing low now, but my voice used to be a lot higher. Because of the way I look, I needed something to ground the entire project. Otherwise I think people would assume I was some airhead singer. Well, I don't think... I know. I've sung one way, and sung another, and I've seen what people are drawn to\\", she said on the topic. =Videos and stage= Del Rey performing at Paradiso in Amsterdam in 2011 Del Rey's videos are also often characterized for their cinematic quality with a retro flair. In her early career, Del Rey recorded clips of herself singing along to her songs on a webcam and juxtaposed them alongside vintage home videos and films to serve as \\"homemade music videos\\", a style which helped gain her early recognition. After the success of these homemade videos, Del Rey had a series of high- budget music videos, including \\"Born To Die\\" and \\"National Anthem\\" (both 2012) and \\"Young and Beautiful\\" (2013). Her early videos featured her \\"bad girl\\", \\"gangster Nancy Sinatra\\" persona. Her following videos for tracks such as \\"Summer Wine\\", \\"Carmen\\", and \\"Summertime Sadness\\" were all produced off of significantly lower budgets and retained more elements of Del Rey's earlier style. The Ultraviolence era incorporated an admixture of high budget videos and self-made ones, while the Honeymoon era was almost strictly film noir- influenced professionally-shot visuals. Both eras saw some of Del Rey's homemade videos for tracks such as \\"Pretty When You Cry\\" and \\"Honeymoon\\" go unreleased due to Del Rey's opinions they were \\"too boring\\". The Lust For Life era was widely characterized for its futuristic flare in its mildly filtered vintage-inspired look. For Norman Fucking Rockwell, Del Rey's sister, Chuck Grant, directed three of the videos in Del Rey's \\"homemade video\\" format, while Rich Lee directed the two follow-ups in a similar vintage but futuristic style, as he had the videos on Lust for Life. Critics have noted Del Rey for her typically simple but authentic live performances. A September 2017 concert review published in The New York Times noted: \\"For more than an hour, Ms. Del Rey was eerily casual, singing and smiling with the ease of someone performing at singer-songwriter night at the local coffee shop.\\" Another review by Roy Train published in The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 noted \\"a distance in her bonhomie, obvious even from my perch at the opposite end of the stage high above the fray, the chill still palpable.\\" Public image =Early reception= Del Rey attending the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. Prior to the release of her debut major label album Born to Die in 2012, Del Rey was the subject of several articles discussing her image and career trajectory. One article by Paul Harris published by The Guardian a week before the album's release noted the differences between Del Rey's perceived persona in 2008, when she performed as Lizzy Grant, and in the present, as Lana Del Rey. Harris wrote: > The internet has allowed figures like [Del Rey] to come rapidly to the fore > of the cultural landscape, whether or not their emergence is planned by a > record executive or happens spontaneously from someone's bedroom. It has > speeded up the fame cycle. It is worth noting that the huge backlash to Del > Rey is happening before her first album has even been released. This reveals > a cultural obsession with the \\"authenticity\\" that fans, artists and > corporations all prize above all else. Tony Simon, a producer who had worked with Del Rey in 2009, defended her against the public claims of inauthenticity and allegations that she was a product of her record label: \\"To be clear, all the detractors saying she's some made-up-by-the-machine pop star are full of shit. While it's impossible to keep the businesses' hands out the pop when creating a pop star, the roots of where this all comes from are firmly inside of Lizzy Grant.\\" In Del Rey's own words, she \\"[n]ever had a persona. Never needed one. Never will.\\" In a 2017 interview, Del Rey stated, \\"I didn't edit myself [on Born to Die] when I could have, because a lot of it's just the way it was. I mean, because I've changed a lot and a lot of those songs, it's not that I don't relate but... A lot of it too is I was just kinda nervous. I came off sort of nervously, and there was just a lot of dualities, a lot of juxtapositions going on that maybe just felt like something was a little off. Maybe the thing that was off was that I needed a little more time or something, and also my path was just so windy just to get to having a first record. I feel like I had to figure it out all by myself. Every move was just guesswork.\\" =Social views and controversies= Del Rey has stated that she is a practicing Roman Catholic and attends church. Having been labeled as antifeminist by multiple sources, Del Rey stated: \\"For me, the issue of feminism is just not an interesting concept. I'm more interested in ... SpaceX and Tesla, what's going to happen with our intergalactic possibilities. Whenever people bring up feminism ... I'm just not really that interested.\\" She also said: > For me, a true feminist is someone who is a woman who does exactly what she > wants. If my choice is to, I don't know, be with a lot of men, or if I enjoy > a really physical relationship, I don't think that's necessarily being anti- > feminist. For me the argument of feminism never really should have come into > the picture. Because I don't know too much about the history of feminism, > and so I'm not really a relevant person to bring into the conversation. > Everything I was writing was so autobiographical, it could really only be a > personal analysis. In 2017, Del Rey further clarified her updated view on feminism in an interview with Pitchfork: > Because things have shifted culturally. It‚Äôs more appropriate now than under > the Obama administration, where at least everyone I knew felt safe. It was a > good time. We were on the up-and-up... Women started to feel less safe under > this administration instantly. What if they take away Planned Parenthood? > What if we can't get birth control? Now, when people ask me those questions, > I feel a little differently... Del Rey has been critical of US President Donald Trump, voiced her support for the #MeToo movement, and identified herself as a feminist; in 2020, she voiced her support for a third wave of feminism. However, in May of that year, she attracted criticism for an Instagram post defending herself against accusations of glamorizing abuse in part by pointing out an array of other female artists, mostly black, and their successes with works about \\"imperfect sexual relationships\\". Del Rey responded to the criticism about race being the theme of her post by saying that she mentioned the singers she did because she \\"[loves] these singers and [knows] them.\\" She also clarified that she was referencing those \\"who don't look strong or necessarily smart, or like they're in control etc.,\\" when she mentioned people \\"who look like [her].\\" Del Rey attracted further criticism for posting a video of looters during the George Floyd protests in May 2020. In September, she was criticized by fans for wearing \\"a mask that seemingly offered little protection\\" during a poetry reading event amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. =Philanthropy= Over the years, Del Rey has supported multiple causes and made several recordings available as offerings to help support causes she believes in. Her 2019 promotional single \\"Looking for America\\" was released amidst the back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton. She committed half of the proceeds from her upcoming album Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass (2020) to support Native American land conservancy rights foundations and organizations dedicated to protecting the civil rights of those indigenous to North America. In the early 2000s, Del Rey worked at a homeless shelter and participated in humanitarian work, including building houses at Navajo Nation. Impact Since her debut, Del Rey has been credited as popularizing the sadcore genre for mainstream audiences. Del Rey has been credited as an influence by a number of artists including Billie Eilish, Lauren Jauregui, Kevin Abstract, and Maggie Lindemann. Billboard credits Born to Die for being one of the main catalysts for pop's mid-2010s shift from brash EDM to a moodier, hip-hop-inflected palette; they also argue that popular music in the 2010s wouldn't be the same without Del Rey. Billboard also stated that Del Rey has influenced both her peers and the next generation of alternative-leaning pop stars, such as Halsey, Banks, Sky Ferreira, Father John Misty, Sia, Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift. Swift has called Del Rey her favorite lyricist. Similarly, Vice suggests that \\"it's hard to imagine an Eilish, a Lorde, or a Halsey\\" without Del Rey. In 2019, Billboard included Del Rey's song \\"Born to Die\\" as one of the 100 songs that defined the 2010s, adding that it influenced \\"a sonic shift that completely changed the pop landscape\\".

She is currently Mary Laird Wood Professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Washington and co-director with Matt Powers of the department's Center for Journalism Media and Democracy. Biography Russell earned a Ph.D. in Journalism and Mass Communication from Indiana University, Bloomington, in 2001, an M.S. in Media Studies from Stanford University in 1995, and a B.A. in World Literature and Cultural Studies from the University of California, Santa Cruz, in 1993. Russell was an associate professor at the University of Denver with a joint appointment in Emergent Digital Practices and in the Media, Film, and Journalism department, where she was also director of graduate studies (2007-2017); an assistant professor in the Department of Global Communication at the American University of Paris (2003-2005); and a research fellow at the Annenberg Center for Communication at the University of Southern California (2005-2007) and at the London School of Economics Department of Media and Communication (2015). Research Russell's research centers on the digital- era evolving relationship between media and public culture. In her early work, she explored activist communication in relation to journalism, mapping the terrain of the expanding networked information-media landscape and investigating related shifting journalism norms and practices. In recent work, she presents environmental journalism as a rich site of innovation and chronicles the way reporters covering the environment have long worked a space rife with misinformation. Russell argues that the climate and information crises today are most productively viewed as inextricable parts of a single larger crisis in public communication and culture -- that criticism of journalism for failing to convey persuasively the urgency of the climate crisis misses half the story. Russell's 2016 book, Journalism as Activism: Recoding Media Power (Polity), seeks to update thinking about communication and politics in the mediated era. The book centers on an emerging vanguard of activists and journalists remaking communication tools and genres to better cover contemporary networked life. From the book's back-cover blurb: > In the mediated digital era, communication is changing fast and eating up > ever greater shares of real-world power. Corporate battles and guerrilla > wars are fought on Twitter. Facebook is the new Berlin ‚Äî home to tinkers, > tailors, spies and terrorist recruiters. We recognize the power shift > instinctively but, in our attempts to understand it, we keep using > conceptual and theoretical models that are not changing fast, that are > barely changing at all, that are laid over from the past. Journalism remains > one of the main sites of communication power, an expanded space where > citizens, protesters, PR professionals, tech developers and hackers can > directly shape the news. Adrienne Russell reports on media power from one of > the most vibrant corners of the journalism field, the corner where > journalists and activists from countries around the world cross streams. > Russell demonstrates the way the relationship between digital journalism and > digital activism has shaped coverage of the online civil liberties movement, > the Occupy movement, and the climate change movement. Journalism as Activism > explores the ways everyday meaning and the material realities of media power > are tied to the communication tools and platforms we have access to, the > architectures of digital space we navigate, and our ability to master and > modify our media environments. Russell is a member of Media Climate, an international group of scholars conducting ongoing comparative research on news coverage of climate change. She also contributed to the book Something Old, Something New: Digital Media and the Coverage of Climate Change (Reuters Institute/I.B. Tauris book series 2016), part of a collaborative project led by James Painter aimed at documenting the coverage produced and the practices followed during the 2015 Paris Climate Summit by digital or \\"new-journalism\\" outlets of the time, including BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post, and Vice. She participated in a transnational research project on coverage of information on the US National Security Agency snooping programs leaked by Edward Snowden. The research results are detailed in the book Journalism and the NSA Revelations: Privacy, Security and the Press (Reuters Institute/I.B. Tauris book series 2016), which she co-edited with Risto Kunelius, Heikki Heikkila, and Dimitri Jagodin. Russell's first book, Networked: A Contemporary History of News in Transition (Polity 2011), examined the transformation of journalism since the mid-1990s. \\"Networked journalism is journalism that sees publics acting as creators, investigators, reactors, re-makers and re-distributors of news,\\" she wrote. \\"It is journalism where all variety of media -- amateur and professional, corporate and independent -- intersect at a new level. The variety of forms and perspectives that deliver news in this environment and the number of connections linking creators to the public and to one another significantly influence the news and have expanded journalism as a category of information and as a genre of storytelling.\\" Russell has edited special editions of the journals New Media and Society (2005) and Journalism: Theory, Criticism, Practice (2011).

Medical patients experiencing difficulty breathing are provided with oxygen-enriched air, which means a higher-than-atmospheric FiO2. Natural air includes 21% oxygen, which is equivalent to FiO2 of 0.21. Oxygen-enriched air has a higher FiO2 than 0.21; up to 1.00 which means 100% oxygen. FiO2 is typically maintained below 0.5 even with mechanical ventilation, to avoid oxygen toxicity, but there are applications when up to 100% is routinely used. Often used in medicine, the FiO2 is used to represent the percentage of oxygen participating in gas-exchange. If the barometric pressure changes, the FiO2 may remain constant while the partial pressure of oxygen changes with the change in barometric pressure.

Medicine  In medicine, the FiO2 is the assumed percentage of oxygen concentration participating in gas exchange in the alveoli.  Uses  The FiO2 is used in the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) severity of disease classification system for intensive care unit patients. For FiO2 values equal to or greater than 0.5, the alveolar‚Äìarterial gradient value should be used in the APACHE II score calculation. Otherwise, the PaO2 will suffice. The ratio between partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) and FiO2 is used as an indicator of hypoxemia per the American-European Consensus Conference on lung injury. A high FiO2 has been shown to alter the ratio of PaO2/FiO2.  ratio  The ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen, known as the Horowitz index or Carrico index, is a comparison between the oxygen level in the blood and the oxygen concentration that is breathed. This helps to determine the degree of any problems with how the lungs transfer oxygen to the blood.

Biography Cooledge was born in Sutter Creek, California in 1884, to Walter Scott Cooledge and Belle McFarland. Cooledge and her mother were members of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Cooledge graduated from Sacramento High School in 1900. She attended U.C. Berkeley where she majored in chemistry and earned her master's degree in education. She began teaching in 1904 and started working at Sacramento High School in 1912 as a math teacher. In 1916, Sacramento Junior College was founded; the college was originally housed in the upper floors of Sacramento High School, at 18th and K streets, with Cooledge as its sole administrator. The college was closed in 1918 after the U.S. entered World War I in 1917. Cooledge took a sabbatical from the college during the war and trained and then worked as an army nurse where she spent another year in the service tending to the wounded soldiers who returned home before resuming her work with Sacramento Junior College when it reopened in 1920. Cooledge soon became the mathematics professor, dean, and vice president of the Sacramento Junior College, now known as Sacramento City College. Cooledge worked for the college for 31 years before retiring in 1947 and was soon elected to the Sacramento city council in 1947 and appointed mayor by her colleagues in 1948. She was the first woman to hold the position and did so for two years. She served an additional two years on the city council and was not reelected during the election of 1951. Cooledge ‚Äútakes her defeat cheerfully,‚Äù proclaimed an article in the Sacramento Bee written by Gene Hill. She was a member of the P.E.O. Sisterhood.Sacramento Bee, November 10, 1955, p. 8 Cooledge died four years later in November 1955. She is buried beside her parents and her mother's parents in the Lodi Memorial Park & Cemetery, in Lodi, California. In the 1931 edition of ‚ÄúThe Pioneer,‚Äù Cooledge wrote of her hopes for all City College students. ‚ÄúMy wish for you all is that you may take the spirit of endeavor and desire to succeed which we have watched grow in you, to your future undertakings, and that happiness and success may be your reward.‚Äù  I  A branch of the Sacramento Public Library located in the Land Park neighborhood is named in her honor.

It took place at midnight on August 14, 2011 at Hog Rock in Cave-In-Rock, Illinois. Professional wrestling is a type of sports entertainment in which theatrical events are combined with a competitive sport. The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before, during, and after the event, were planned by JCW's script writers. The event starred wrestlers from Juggalo Championship Wrestling's bi-weekly internet wrestling show. Nine matches were held on the event's card. The main event match was a JCW Heavyweight Championship match that featured the champion Corporal Robinson defeating Vampiro. Featured matches on the undercard included a tag team match where the team of 2 Tuff Tony and The Weedman defeated Officer Colt Cabana and U.S. Marshal Adam Pearce, a singles match that saw Kongo Kong defeat Rhino, and a 4 team tag team match for the JCW Tag Team Championship in which the team of Raven and Sexy Slim Goody defeated Mean Old Bastards (Tracy Smothers and Bull Pain), Mad Man Pondo and Necro Butcher, and the champion Ring Rydas. Background Bloodymania 5 featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines that were played at Juggalo Championship Wrestling's bi-weekly events. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The event featured wrestlers from Juggalo Championship Wrestling's roster. Amber O'Neal set out to form a female division within the company At Hatchet Attacks, JCW Heavyweight champion Corporal Robinson was assaulted by Breyer Wellington and Butler Jeeves. Vampiro fended off the attack, but informed Robinson that he intended on challenging him for the championship in the future. Though Robinson lost the championship the following month, he regain it by defeating Officer Colt Cabana at Fuck the Police. Following the victory, all of the lights in the arena shut off. When they turned back on, Vampiro appeared in the ring and kicked Robinson in the face. He then posed with the championship belt, and a match was scheduled between Vampiro and the champion. Amber O'Neal debuted at the event Send in the Clowns, and began insulting the fans, the talent, and the promoters. One of the company's ring girls, Randy, took exception to the comments and challenged O‚ÄôNeal to a match. Accompanied by her trainer Britney Force, Randy was being easily handled by O'Neal in their match the following week. Seeing that her trainee was in trouble, Force threw in the towel. Though she was offended by the forfeit, Randy accompanied Force in her match against O‚ÄôNeal at Fuck the Police. As Force was about to gain the pinfall, Randy threw in the towel on Force's behalf. After Randy and Force fought and attacked each other, a triple threat match was made between them and O‚ÄôNeal at Bloodymania 5. Managed by Truth Martini, Kongo Kong had established himself as a mighty opponent in the company with a string of dominant victories. He was challenged by Rhino at the event Send in the Clowns, but the two wrestled to a no contest after Martini caused Rhino to inadvertently knock out the referee. Kong attacked Rhino at the two following shows, leading Rhino to fight back at Fuck the Police. A rematch was scheduled between the two at Bloodymania 5. Martini was later removed as Kong's manager in the match after he was injured, per storyline, from a tackle by Rhino. Tracy Smothers teamed with Bull Pain, despite rumors of a relationship between Pain and his daughter Isabella At Up in Smoke, Ring Rydas defeated JCW Tag Team champions Mad Man Pondo and Necro Butcher to win the championship. After Pondo and Necro won the rights for number one contendership, the duo announced that they would not ask for a match until after their friends Ring Rydas lost the titles. Meanwhile, per storyline, Tracy Smothers was set to be released from prison. He wanted to confront his friend Bull Pain about an alleged relationship with Tracy's daughter Isabella, but Pain persuaded him that the stories were only rumors. The duo formed the tag team Mean Old Bastards and viciously defeated the contenders then the champions in the following weeks. The three teams were then placed in a 4 team tag team match for the championship at Bloodymania 5 that would also include the team of Raven and Sexy Slim Goody. Butler Jeeves arrived in Juggalo Championship Wrestling as the butler of wrestler Breyer Wellington. Following Wellington's orders, Jeeves aided him in attacking JCW Heavyweight champion Corporal Robinson on numerous occasions. At Up in Smoke, Jeeves won the championship after he was as added to a match that also involved Wellington and the champion. Wellington demanded that Jeeves hand the championship over to him, but Jeeves lost it at Send in the Clowns. A frustrated Wellington blamed Jeeves for his own loss the following week, and then proceeded to attack him before firing him. At the following show, Wellington revealed that he had hired Jeeves‚Äô wife to fulfill all of his needs. Jeeves then challenged Wellington to a match at Bloodymania 5 where the winner would receive the services of his wife. U.S. Marshal Adam Pearce was brought in to assist Officer Colt Cabana U-Gene and Zach Gowen formed a tag team at the event Up in Smoke, but the duo lost their first string of matches due to U-Gene's own unintentional doings. At Fuck the Police, they gained their first victory by defeating JCW Tag Team champion Ring Rydas for the championship. However, Gowen forfeited the championship after realizing that U-Gene cheated to win. An enraged U-Gene then attacked Zach Gowen for his decision, disbanding the team and forcing a match between the two at Bloodymania 5. Due to The Weedman's storyline illegal use of smoking and selling marijuana, Officer Colt Cabana targeted the hero as the first offender to be brought down in an effort to keep order and force respect for the law. At St. Andrews Brawl, Cabana defeated Weedman in a Mask vs. Badge match. He offered Weedman the opportunity to keep his mask by working as his deputy, to which Weedman unwillingly accepted. In the following weeks, Cabana humiliated his deputy by causing him to lose matches and forcing him to wrestle in handcuffs. When Cabana targeted hero 2 Tuff Tony, Weedman defended his friend and instead attacked Cabana. U.S. Marshal Adam Pearce was brought in by Cabana the following week, and the team was placed in a tag team match against 2 Tuff Tony and a mystery partner at Bloodymania 5.

It consists of four distinct caves along the course of the Chiquibul River; Actun Kabal, Actun Tun Kul (Tunkul) and Cebada Cave in Belize, and Xibalba in Guatemala, as well as several other smaller associated caves. Included within the cave system are two of the largest caverns in the world. Entrance to Actun Kabal, part of the Chiquibul Cave System, in Belize  Actun Kabal (Kabal Group) This upper section of the Chiquibul Cave System has over 12 km of mapped passages with a depth of -95 m. Included is Chiquibul Chamber, at 250 m by 150 m one of the world's largest caverns.  Actun Tun Kul  Tun Kul (\\"stone drum\\") includes Belize Chamber - with dimensions of 300 m by 150 m by 65 m, it is one of the largest natural caverns in the world. Tun Kul was connected with Cebada Cave in 1999 resulting in a 39km long cave. Huge cave passage in Actun Kabal, part of the Chiquibul Cave System, in Belize  Cebada Cave  Cebada Cave and Tun Kul were linked in 1999; at 39 km it is the longest cave in Belize.  Xibalba  This downstream section of the Chiquibul Cave System is entirely within Guatemala, and at -187 m was briefly that country's deepest cave (currently Jul Mas Nim, at -294 m). Over seven kilometres of passages have been mapped, including some that are over 100 m wide. The cave entrance is 200 m across.  Exploration  Cavers Mike Boon and Tom Miller visited the area in 1971 and 1982 respectively, with Miller initiating the first cave explorations as part of his PhD work. Miller followed up with major international, interdisciplinary expeditions in 1984, 1986 and 1988, partially funded by National Geographic and the National Speleological Society. The first expedition surveyed 23 km of dry cave passages in Kabal and Tun Kul at the upstream part of the system, ending at a sump at the end of Tun Kul. The second expedition surveyed 27 km of dry and river passages in Cebada and Xibalba. The third expedition attempted but failed to connect Cebada with Tun Kul. In 1990 a comprehensive cave survey was prepared by Steve Grundy and Olivia Whitwell.  Biology  Biological collections and observations were conducted in 1986 in Cebada Cave, and other collections were made in 1984 and 1988. Seventy invertebrate species are known from the system.  Protection  Despite its remoteness, the area is threatened by agricultural activities, fires, illegal logging, wildlife hunting, looting of cultural artifacts, and vandalism of both cultural and geological assets. The Chiquibul Cave System is within Chiquibul National Park, a 264,000-acre reserve in the Maya Mountains massif. In 2007 it was determined that the cave system needed special consideration, and in 2010 The Nature Conservancy presented a five-year management plan which includes provisions for controlled tourism on a very limited basis.

The film was directed by Kenta Fukasaku, and it stars Osamu Mukai, T≈çri Matsuzaka, Tasuku Emoto and Masataka Kubota as the main characters. The film was released in Japanese cinemas on 23 September 2011. It grossed a total of US$3,334,273 over its four-week theatrical run in the Japanese box office. Plot Kota is a medical school student who is doing badly for his examinations. He feels that something is missing in his life, but he is not sure what it is. One day, he chance upon a pamphlet asking for help with building schools for children in Cambodia, Kota decides to recruit his friends to complete the task. However, in order to build the school, they will have to raise 1.5 million yen by themselves. The group go down to work, finding sponsors and recruiting volunteers. They also plan to organize club parties as their fund-raising activity. All seems smooth going as they found an IT company that was willing to sponsor them, and got many interested people to help out. Kota also meets Kaori, a nursing student who studies at the same school, whom Kota starts to feel attracted to. After an unconvincing appeal for donations at their first fund-raising party, Kaori suggested that the group visit Cambodia to feel the situation for themselves. The group took up the advice and booked a flight to Cambodia. There, they were surprised with what they saw. After visiting a hospital for patients suffering from AIDS and a museum dedicated to the victims of Khmer Rouge, their spirit sank. In particular, Mitsuru was so affected by the experience that he had to return to Japan early. After they toured tourist sights, they proceeded to the village were their school would be built. Suddenly, they saw a group of children wading through an uncleared minefield to welcome them. They were also shocked to see the rundown state of the existing village school. In spite of that, they were cheered by the positive spirit that the children there displayed. Upon their return to Japan, they discovered that the company that was sponsoring them was implicated in an insider trading scandal and their donation boxes were also vandalized frequently. Furthermore, many of their volunteers quit after they were unhappy with the decision to impose strict fund-raising targets. Kota himself was facing relationship problems with Kaori and deteriorating results. As such became demoralized about the project and started shutting himself at home. This changed when a Cambodian child he met sent him a letter written in Japanese. He felt hope again, and their fund- raising activities gained momentum. In the end, they managed to raise the 1.5 million yen in the three fund-raising party, and thus the school could be built. The group was then invited to the school's opening ceremony, Before the ceremony, Kota noticed that the child who wrote to him was not present at the school. He was told that because the minefield had been cleared recently, farmland was available to the boy's family and the boy had to farm. Kota immediately went to persuade the boy's parents. Eventually, after he took the hoe and tilled the land in desperation, he managed to convince the boy's family to let him attend the village school. As such, all of the members received a warm reception by the students of the school.

The origin and the creator of this kata are unknown, but its preservation and appearance in Okinawa can be credited to Nakaima Norisato, an Okinawan martial artist that was able to fully document and record fighting techniques learned by during his study and travels in China. Nakaima, a Chinese scholar, studied with the top Chinese martial arts practitioners in the Beijing area during the mid-19th century. The kata contains many palm heel strikes as well as evasive footwork. The open hand and crane fist techniques lend credibility to this kata having roots in Chinese kung fu. The techniques can be applied as short-distance strikes and grappling to immobilize and control the opponent.  Origins  It is known that this kata has been passed down through an old family style of Karate called Ry≈´ei- ry≈´. This style of karate still exists today, with the techniques passed down to only seven chief instructors worldwide. Norisato Nakaima is credited with bringing the kata to Naha after learning it during his study in China. The techniques learned by Nakaima were handed down only within the family until the late 1960s. Among the more renowned practitioners of Ryueiryu are the former multiple world champion T. Sakumoto, T. Arashiro, an Okinawan residing in the United States since 1979 teaching sport Karate and G.

History  Work on the first tramway line started in 1914 and it was opened on 26 June 1916. Until 1956 Arkhangelsk had two separate tramway networks ‚Äì one running on the mainland and the other on the island of Solombala as there was no bridge to carry the trams over the Kuznechikha river. At certain times during the winter, tracks were laid directly on the ice (a similar method was used in St Petersburg during some winters). The opening of the Kuznechevskiy Bridge in 1956 made it possible to connect the two networks permanently. With the demise of the Soviet Union, public transport services declined in many Russian cities. In Arkhangelsk, the Solombala network was shut down in 2000, the official reason being the bad condition of the Kuznechevskiy Bridge. Two years later there were severe cuts to the tramway lines on the mainland. The last tram returned to the depot on 21 July 2004. After this the tramway tracks were removed from the main streets.  Stock  In the last years that the Arkhangelsk tramway operated the following trams were used: * LM-93 ‚Äì 20 four- axle trams, manufactured between 1993 and 1999 by the Petersburg Tram Mechanical Factory * RVZ-6 - one tram Before 2002 six LVS-86T trams were also used.

Additionally, garlic or spring onions can be added to the dish. Rabbit, lamb, or other types of meat are also sometimes used and, alternatively, vegetarian versions can be made during fasting periods.  Origins  Like some other dishes, this is among the Romanian foods with no equivalents abroad. Hence, it is seen as staple of traditional Romanian cuisine.  Preparation  The dish is traditionally prepared by first frying chicken drumsticks or thighs. Afterwards, water is mixed with the cooking oil, tomato sauce, flour, garlic and onions until the sauce reaches a boiling point, at which point the chicken is added and left to boil for another fifteen minutes, or until the sauce gains a thick consistency. Before serving, parsley is sprinkled on top. MƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ (polenta) is typically used as a side dish, together with a light salad.  Variations  Like many Romanian dishes, the ostropel has regional variations. For example, in Moldova the recipe is rather simple, without many other ingredients added to the sauce. However, in Oltenia carrots and vinegar are added to the sauce, and the final dish is served with boiled potatoes instead of mƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ.

History and architecture The church is located on farmland close to the river, about 1 mile north of the village. It was originally medieval but was rebuilt in 1875‚Äì76 by the architect John Dando Sedding, commissioned by the local rector, Rev. William John Coussmaker Lindsay (1832‚Äì1912).Rev. Lindsay at thePeerage.com The church contains some mediaeval features including a font, but is best known for its Arts and Crafts style sgraffito decorations which cover the interior walls. These were commissioned by Lindsay at a cost of ¬£500 in memory of his wife Rosamund, and were designed by Heywood Sumner. Taking the Benedicite as his theme, Sumner used thin layers of different coloured plaster cut back to reveal colour underneath. His designs included local features, including the River Usk, the Sugar Loaf and nearby Llanvihangel Gobion church tower. Sumner's work was completed in 1888. In the 1980s, the church was declared redundant and threatened with demolition. It was vested in the charity the Friends of Friendless Churches in 1989, and the charity has held the freehold since 22 November 1989. The charity was supported by the Victorian Society and received financial support from Cadw and the Pilgrim Trust.

Ludlow joined the Bengal medical department (season of 1804) and was appointed Assistant Surgeon, First Class, on 18 March 1805. In March 1806 he became Assistant Surgeon to the civil station of Benaras. He was transferred to the Delhi Residency in 1813, and promoted to Surgeon on 30 January 1817. In 1828, at the time of the wedding of his daughter, he was Presidency Surgeon at Delhi. In 1831 he was appointed Superintending Surgeon and on 28 March of that year, transferred from Delhi to the Neemuch Division of the British Indian Army. On 7 December 1835 he was appointed Superintending Surgeon, Agra Circle. On 11 August 1838 he was transferred from the Agra circle to Superintending Surgeon, Sirhind Division, British Indian Army, based in Ambala. Ludlow was appointed to the Bengal Medical Board and eventually retired from East India Company service and settled in Exeter. In 1844, he was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Hon.), one of the original 300. Sometime later, Samuel Ludlow moved to Bath, where he died on 17 October 1853 after a protracted illness. His widow, Mary Ludlow, died in Cheltenham on 26 July 1870, aged 93. Ludlow is best known today for having constructed a house in the Civil Lines, just outside the city walls of Old Delhi, which was christened \\"Ludlow Castle,\\" a play on words on his surname, the building's turret, its decorative crenelations, and the 11th-century Ludlow Castle, Shropshire. Ludlow Castle, Delhi, was later to become the Residency at Delhi, and, still later, in September 1857, be the site of a battery used by British troops in the Siege of Delhi to breach the city wall and retake the city.

It was developed by Rare and published by LJN. It should not be confused with an unrelated game with the same title for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC released in 1989. Gameplay The player takes on the role of an ordinary teenager. Additional teenagers can be controlled by up to three other players with the use of the NES Four Score. The objective is to scour the vicinity of Elm Street, collect the bones of the supernatural serial killer Freddy Krueger and dispose of them in the local high school's furnace. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a horizontal side-scrolling beat 'em up. The game's environment is inhabited by hostile characters, such as zombies, cats, dogs, skeletons, bats, rats, spiders and minotaurs, that will attack the player character. Being attacked a certain number of times will cause the player to lose a life. Because the game takes place around midnight, certain areas are initially locked off from the player and require a key to be collected for later access. Within the individual buildings, the player must collect the bones scattered throughout the level before being able to leave. When all the bones are collected, a boss battle with Freddy will commence. Defeating Freddy will both allow the player to exit the area and earn the player a key that allows access to a new area. A game mechanic unique to the title is the \\"Sleep Meter\\". The meter indicates how close the player character is to falling asleep. If even one of the player characters falls asleep, all of the player characters will be transported to an alternate version of the environment referred to as the \\"Dream World\\", where the player is more vulnerable to attacks from Freddy. The Sleep Meter decreases automatically, but does so at a slower pace when the player character stays in motion. The Sleep Meter can be increased by collecting cups of coffee scattered throughout the levels. When in the Dream World, the player character can be returned to the default version of the level by collecting the boombox placed somewhere within the level. Collecting certain icons grants the player characters special powers while they're within the Dream World, namely the ability to throw shurikens, javelins or magic projectiles. Development According to the game magazine Nintendo Power, the original concept of this game varied greatly from what was eventually released. In the original game concept, the players would control Freddy Krueger and should kill the teenagers who were attempting to gather his scattered bones in order to rebury them.http://dailydead.com/retro-gaming-review-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-nes/ Follows the synopsis of the prototype version of the game: It is assumed that this version of the game had been cancelled to prevent controversy. Years earlier, a video game adaptation of the movie The Texas Chain Saw Massacre had been released for the Atari 2600, where the player controls the murderer with the objective to chase and kill victims. The game was a financial failure because many sellers refused to sell it, fearing reprisals. Reception Chris Bieniek of VideoGames & Computer Entertainment called A Nightmare on Elm Street unusually good for a film-based game, praising it's \\"smooth, quick, and responsive\\" controls, and strong presentation, highlighting the \\"movielike wavering of the screen\\" that occurs when entering the dream world. Its graphics and music were also positively commented on in retrospective reviews, which were more mixed on the gameplay. The Video Game Critic claimed that although A Nightmare on Elm Street was \\"standard platform fare,\\" it was made somewhat engaging by an atmosphere that reflected the movies a sleep meter aspect that the publication positively compared to the material-and-spectral- realm system of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (1999). Writing in retrospect in 2010, an IGN journalist was mixed towards the game, praising its sleep meter element but also feeling it was a \\"low-rent Castlevania with a great but bizarrely weak super-villain.\\"Buchanan, Levi (April 30, 2010). \\"An NES Nightmare on Elm Street\\". IGN. Retrieved November 22, 2016. Adam Wallace of Defunct Games opined that despite \\"okay\\" platforming, the experience was made less enjoyable by its random order of stages, \\"unavoidable hazards,\\" absence of a health bar, and bosses featuring \\"cheap\\" hits and not taking enough advantage of concepts from the films: \\"Why not have Freddy take some of the forms from the movies like the snake from Dream Warriors, the comic book supervillain from Dream Master, or the demented chef from Dream Child? Hell, I wouldn't even have minded the ridiculous stuff from Freddy's Dead!\\" GameCola also panned that there wasn't a health bar as well as the improper difficulty of the dream segments: \\"The dream warrior‚Äôs have projectile attacks, but you can‚Äôt always use them. For the most part you‚Äôre forced to fight enemies with your stubby arm that reach just far enough to get you killed any time you fight something.\\" Legacy In 2013, NECA released a GameStop exclusive figure of the Nintendo-style Freddy Krueger, similar to their Nintendo-style Jason Voorhees figure based on LJN's 1989 Friday the 13th game.

Buckley/D. Clark, The Rough Guide to the Internet (2009) p. 312-5 Douglas Rushkoff sings the praises of Web 2.0 by stating, \\"The Internet's ability to network human beings is its very life's blood. It fosters communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community... The ideas, information, and applications now launching on Web sites around the world capitalize on the transparency, usability, and accessibility that the internet was born to deliver\\". The rise of Internet censorship and surveillance and cyber sovereignty across the world has led to a growing number of \\"cyber skeptics\\" arguing that repressive governments are able to adapt their tactics to respond to threats, using technology against the interests of dissenting movements. In 2011, cyber-utopianism, particularly in global politics, was powerfully critiqued by Evgeny Morozov in his 2011 book The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom.R. Sassower, Digital Exposure: Postmodern Capitalism (2013) p. ix and p. 16 Acknowledging his own past as a cyber-utopian, Morozov calls the belief naive and stubborn for its refusal to acknowledge the downside ‚Äì the opportunities for authoritarian monitoring and control ‚Äì of cyber-space. He goes on to blame the \\"former hippies\\" in the 1990s, for causing this utopian belief. :\\"Cyber-utopians ambitiously set out to build a new and improved United Nations, only to end up with a digital Cirque du Soleil\\"  Origins: Californian ideology  The Californian Ideology is a set of beliefs combining bohemian and anti-authoritarian attitudes from the counterculture of the 1960s with techno-utopianism and support for neoliberal economic policies. These beliefs are thought by some to have been characteristic of the culture of the IT industry in Silicon Valley and the West Coast of the United States during the dot-com boom of the 1990s. Adam Curtis connects it to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy. Such an ideology of digital utopianism fuelled the first generation of Internet pioneers.J.M Reagle jr, Good Faith Collaboration (2010) p. 162  Further criticisms  Critical reservations about popular positivist readings of the Internet have surfaced repeatedly over the decades: In 2006, Andrew Keen wrote that Web 2.0 is a \\"grand utopian movement\\" similar to \\"communist society\\" as described by Karl Marx. According to Shirky, \\"By lowering transaction costs, social tools provide a platform for communities of practice...Communities of practice are inherently cooperative, and are beautifully supported by social tools, because that is exactly the kind of community whose members can recruit one another or allow themselves to be found by interested searchers.\\" In an article from The New Yorker from 2010, Malcolm Gladwell argues his doubts about the emancipatory and empowering qualities of social media in general. In the article he criticizes Clay Shirky for propagating and overestimating the revolutionary potential of social media. In the conclusion he says: \\"Shirky considers this model of activism an upgrade. But it is simply a form of organizing which favors the weak-tie connections that give us access to information over the strong-tie connections that help us persevere in the face of danger.\\" Cyber-utopianism has been compared to a secular religion for the postmodern world.B. Neilson, Free Trade in the Bermuda Triangle (2004) p. 181 Cognate utopias Cyber-utopianism is somewhat derivative of the views espoused by the Extropians, whose ultimate goal is to upload human consciousness to the Internet. Additionally, Ray Kurzweil's books, especially The Age of Spiritual Machines, espouses a kind of cyber-utopianism, in that he views an event, the Singularity, where advances in technology will be so rapid as to represent a barrier after which life will be experientially different, incomprehensible, and advanced. Cyber-dystopia In August 2007, David Nye presented the idea of cyber-dystopia, which envisions a world made worse by technological advancements. Cyber-dystopias center around the principles of the individual losing control, becoming dependent and being unable to stop change. Nye describes a society where the elite use technology to oppress and control mass groups of people. He also presents technology as a form of false hope; promising success and change, but causing pain and inconvenience when that goal is not reached. In her book Personal Connections, Nancy Baym talks about the way a cyber-dystopia would negatively affect social interactions. \\"The dystopian alternative is usually articulated as a fear that new media will take people away from their intimate relationships, as they substitute mediated relationships or even media use itself for face to face engagement\\". She compares this fear with the fear that many felt during the introduction of the television and the telephone, as people grew weary about the potential for substitution of meaningful relationships. The dystopian voices of Andrew Keen, Jaron Lanier, and Nicholas Carr have pointed out that what we as a society are sacrificing to the cult of cyber-utopians is our humanity. Lanier describes it as \\"an apocalypse of self-abdication\\". Lanier states that \\"consciousness is attempting to will itself out of existence\\". He then asks us to consider, \\"What is a person?\\". Lanier warns that by emphasizing the crowd we are de- emphasizing individual humans and when you ask people to stop being people, they revert to mob-like behaviors. Keen and Carr also agree that there is a dangerous mob mentality that dominates the internet. Keen states that rather than creating more democracy, the internet is empowering the rule of the mob and that rather than fostering a renaissance of social equality it has created a \\"selfie-centered\\" culture of voyeurism and narcissism. As Nicholas Carr states in The Glass Cage, \\"the prevailing methods of computerized communication and coordination pretty much ensure that the role of people will go on shrinking. We‚Äôve designed a system that discards us\\".  In politics  Cyber-utopian discourses have been used in the political context, notably by the Pirate Parties. In Italy, the Five Star Movement extensively uses cyber- utopian rhetoric, promising direct democracy and better environmental regulations through the Web.

Ludlow Castle, Delhi was a building located in the Civil Lines in Delhi, India, which for a time during East India Company rule in the first half of the 19th century served as the Residency of the British political agent to the Mughal Court; later it was the headquarters of the Commissioner of the Delhi Territory within the North- Western Provinces. Until 1831, Ludlow Castle had been the home of Samuel Ludlow, the Residency Surgeon. The building then became the Residency, and was the site of a battery employed by British troops during the Indian rebellion of 1857 to successfully breach the Kashmiri Gate bastion and thereafter to retake the city. After 1857‚Äîin the first few decades of the British Raj‚ÄîLudlow Castle remained the home of the Chief Commissioner; Delhi Territory, however, had become a part of the Punjab Province. Among the building's many guests during this period was the former US President Ulysses S. Grant. During the late 19th century and much of the first half of the 20th, the building housed the Delhi Club. Staying there in 1916 was the wedding party of Jawaharlal Nehru. After India's independence in 1947, the Ludlow Castle building was turned into a high school. The building was demolished in the 1960s to make room for the expansion of the school, now the Government Model Senior Secondary School. The neighbourhood and the transit stop in Delhi, however, continue to be known as \\"Ludlow Castle.\\" Home and Delhi Residency Ink and colours sketch made more than a decade after Samuel Ludlow and his family had left Delhi showing Ludlow Castle being used as the Delhi Residency, with waiting carriage, camels, elephants, and Skinner's Horse. Samuel Ludlow had the house constructed sometime after he moved to Delhi in 1813, its name, \\"Ludlow Castle,\\" a play on words on his surname, the building's turret, its decorative crenelations, and the 11th-century Ludlow Castle, Shropshire. During his time in Delhi, Ludlow was promoted from Assistant Surgeon in the East India Company, Bengal Presidency medical establishment, to full Surgeon in 1817, and to Presidency Surgeon. In 1831, he was promoted to Superintending Surgeon and transferred out of Delhi. From 1832 to 1857, Ludlow Castle was the home of the British Resident to the Mughal Court in Delhi. Among the Residents who lived in Ludlow Castle were William Fraser (1832‚Äì1835), Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalfe (1835‚Äì1853) and Simon Fraser (1853‚Äì1857). Siege of Delhi A map of the Siege of Delhi, 1857, showing the location of battery number 2 at Ludlow Castle. Ludlow Castle, which had been damaged during the Indian rebellion of 1857, being repaired after the British retook Delhi in September 1857. Photograph of Ludlow Castle taken in 1858 by Robert and Harriet Tytler showing some more repairs undertaken. The siege train, consisting of fifteen 24-pounder guns, twenty 18-pounder guns and twenty-five heavy mortars and howitzers, with almost 600 ammunition carts, arrived on 6 September. Wilson's chief Engineer Officer, Richard Baird Smith, had drawn up a plan to breach the city walls and make an assault. As a preliminary step, on 6 September the British constructed \\"Reid's Battery\\", or the \\"Sammy House Battery\\", of two 24-pounder and four 9-pounder guns, near the southern end of the ridge, to silence the guns on the Mori Bastion. Under cover of Reid's Battery, on 7 September the first siege battery proper was established, from the Mori Bastion. Four of its guns engaged the artillery on the Kashmir Bastion, while six guns and a heavy mortar demolished the Mori Bastion. After a long duel, it silenced the rebels' guns on the Mori Bastion. The direction of this attack also deceived the rebels that the storming attempt would be made from the east, rather than the north. A second battery, consisting of nine 24-pounder guns, two 18-pounder guns and seven 8-inch mortars, was set up near Ludlow Castle and opened fire against the Kashmir Bastion on 11 September. A third battery of six 18-pounder guns was set up near the old Custom House less than from the city walls, and opened fire against the Water Bastion near the Yamuna next day. A fourth battery of ten heavy mortars was set up in cover near the Khudsia Bagh. Because the element of surprise had been lost, the Indian sappers and pioneers who carried out much of the work of constructing the second and third batteries and moving the guns into position suffered heavy casualties (over 300), but the batteries quickly made breaches in the bastions and walls. The opening of this phase of the siege seems to have coincided with the exhaustion of the ammunition the rebels had captured from the magazine, as the rebel fire became suddenly much less effective. By this time also, the rebels had become depressed through lack of supplies and money, and by defeatist rumours which were spread by agents and spies organised by William Hodson. After the rebellion A later 1858 photograph (taken by Felice Beato) shows the repairs completed. Photograph from Christmas 1878 showing Delhi Commissioner G. Gordon Young and his wife sitting in their carriage in the driveway of Ludlow Castle. A little over a month later they would host former U.S. president Ulysses S. Grant there. For many years in the second half of the 19th century, Ludlow Castle was the home of the Commissioner of Delhi, who often hosted visiting dignitaries there. From 5 to 9 February 1870, Prince Alfred, the second son of Queen Victoria and the then Duke of Edinburgh, was the guest of the Commissioner of Delhi, Col. McNeile, in Ludlow Castle. After arriving in Delhi in the late afternoon, and after an early dinner, the prince was taken on a tour of Old Delhi. Accompanying surgeon Joseph Fayrer recorded the evening enthusiastically: > The Duke was in the howdah with Colonel McNeile. ... The road to the Lahore > Gate was beautifully illuminated with coloured lamps hanging from the trees; > the effect was excellent, and free from the formality of continuous lines of > light. There were triumphal arches in the Chandney Chowk and Dureeba, and up > to the front of the steps of the Jumma Musjid was one continuous blaze of > Bengal lights and other forms of illumination. The streets, and every house- > top, window and balcony were crowded; numbers preceding the elephants, > joining the European soldiers in loud hurrahs, made a most exciting scene. > Dismounting at the foot of the Jumma Musjid, the Duke, with many ladies and > gentlemen, witnessed a grand displayof fireworks from the platform of the > mosque. They then returned to Ludlow Castle. In February 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, on a tour of India, after two terms as US President, was a guest of the then commissioner of Delhi, G. Gordon Young, in Ludlow Castle. After being received at the Delhi Railway Station, Mr. and Mrs. Grant were driven to Ludlow Castle, while the rest of the party found lodgings in nearby hotels. For the next few days, Grant and party visited historic monuments in the city, including the Red Fort, the Qutub Minar and the Jama Masjid. Accompanying General Grant was the American journalist John Russell Young, whose experience of the Jama Masjid was more sober: > This mosque even now is one of the noblest buildings in India. It stands in > the center of the city, built upon a rock. In the ancient time there were > four streets that converged upon the mosque, leading into various parts of > the town. But as the mosque was used during the mutiny as a fort, all the > space in front of it has been cleared for military purposes, and the space > between the mosque and the palace that was formerly densely peopled is now > an open plain, where troops may maneuver and cannon may fire. Nothing is > more important in the civilization of India by the English than that the > cannon should have range. Twentieth Century A soccer goalpost formed the foreground of a photograph of Ludlow Castle, Delhi, taken on May 10, 1957. Some ten years earlier, after India's independence, the building had been converted to a school. The building was to be torn down in the 1960s to make room for the expansion of the school, now the Government Model Senior Secondary School. According to Manmohini Zutshi Sahgal, in 1916, the wedding party of Jawaharlal Nehru, later the first prime minister of independent India, stayed at Ludlow Castle (then the Delhi Club) during their Delhi sojourn. Ludlow Castle, Delhi, was demolished in the 1960s and in its place now stands the Government Model Senior Secondary School.

The phenotypical variation of an individual in this system determines the individual's social identity and social relations, although it does not necessarily denote their social position.  Definition  The term ‚Äòsomatocentric‚Äô is derived from * ‚Äúsoma‚Äù, New Latin, meaning ‚Äòbody‚Äô * and ‚Äúcentric‚Äù from the Greek ‚Äúkentrikos‚Äù, meaning of the center. In this system, the physical body of an individual is heavily emphasized, and valued in determining the social identity of the individual.  Perception  A necessary precondition for individuals in a somatocentric system is the privileging of sight over other senses in perceiving reality. Using vision as the primary sense for constructing reality may cause one to miss complex and hidden nuances of existence, limiting perception.Coetzee, Pieter Hendrik, Race and Gender, 28 September 2001. A comparison of sight and hearing shows that sight is mono-directional and exclusive, while sound is proximate, fluid, and inclusive.Lowe, David: History of Bourgeois Perception. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982, pp. 7 Privileging sight over other senses facilitates a type of self-image that focus on the individual's body, as vision is the primary means to delineate phenotypical difference. Identifying these differences this way may lead to attributing social value to individuals who look a certain way. = Body Image = Body image is a subjective picture of one's own physical appearance established both by self-awareness and by noting the reactions of others.Merriam-Webster Online, Body image, \\"\\", 25 September 2011. Preoccupation with body image and the physical appearance of one's body denotes how much value one ascribes to their phenotypical traits. Body image may be valued highly, and more often than not, dissatisfaction with one's own body image perverts that value with other social effects.  Body Dysmorphic Disorder  People who suffer from Body Dysmorphic Disorder (or BDD) fixate on a defect in their appearance. People with BDD are affected daily with stress and anxiety, which may impair their role in the social and occupational areas of their life. The amount of social value ascribed to the importance of body image affects the level of stress someone suffering from BDD feels.Fox, Kate. Body Image Studies, 1997. \\"\\", 25 September 2011.  Height  Studies show that in some cultures, people who are relatively taller than others get relatively better treatment by their peers. A study conducted in Australia found that tall people earn higher wages than their equally competent shorter co-workers.Alexander, Kathy. Tall men earn $1000 more than short ones, 17 May 2009. \\"\\", 25 September 2011. A study conducted in Southampton of ninety-two normal teens who were shorter than their peers revealed that the shorter boys were twice as likely to be bullied than their average height controls matched by sex and age.Voss, Linda D. and Mulligan, Jean. Bullying in school: are short pupils at risk?, 1 November 2000. \\"\\", 25 September 2011. The findings of these studies reveal a correlation between height and social value, indicating somatocentric issues. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists define ‚Äòshort stature‚Äô as being two standard deviations below the average for a particular age and sex; in America, a male shorter than 5‚Äô7‚Äô‚Äô and a female shorter than 5‚Äô2‚Äô‚Äô are both short statured.\\"NOSSA, What is short statured?\\", 2011, \\"\\", 25 September 2011. Groups have been formed by people who feel short, such as The National Organization of Short Statured Adults (NOSSA). One of the primary functions of this group is to inform its members of the sociological and psychological aspects of being short statured as research continues.\\"NOSSA, About Us\\", 2011, \\"\\", 25 September 2011. = Racism = Racism is defined by a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.Merriam- Webster Online, Racism, \\"\\", 25 September 2011. Racial differences are most easily compared by the phenotypical differences between peoples of a different race, i.e. skin tone, facial features, hair color, and body type. To place social value on any trait, whether positive or negative, is a product of somatocentric values. = Gender = A somatocentric culture may create social constructs based on the interpretation of biological differences between its individuals. The concept of ‚Äògender‚Äô is an example of a construct that may arise from somatocentricity. Sex and gender are loosely related as they both deal with the male and the female; however, one considers empirical distinction, while the other considers social distinction.Oyewumi, Oyeronke, The Invention of Women, 1997, 5 September 2011 A sex refers to biological distinctions between males and females. Certain biological structures are unique to either females or males; in humans, the ovary being unique to the former, the prostate gland being unique to the latter. Biological differences between males and females govern the action of reproduction in any species that repopulates via sexual reproduction, and in some cases, influence the action of child-rearing. By contrast, gender roles, gender identities, and the concepts of masculine and feminine are all social constructs which may be extrapolated from phenotypical differences between men and women. For example, in Western culture, women may fill domestic social roles, with an emphasis on childcare. Women are also unique members of a population that are outfitted with breasts which help feed infants, while men lack these organs. While it is logical to assert that women may be biologically better suited for postnatal care of an infant than men, it does not follow from the ability to breast-feed that women are better suited to domestic social roles than men.  Masculinity and Femininity  Masculinity and femininity are also engendered concepts that may draw from phenotypical difference between male and female. A person who exhibits physical strength may be deemed masculine, while a person who exhibits gentleness may be deemed feminine. Attributing significance to the phenotypical difference between the size or shape of men and women creates a binary between the two that allows the casual observer to presume social significance of a person in terms of this arbitrary scale.

Meanwhile, Cardigan decides to defend a homeless woman, June Perry (Helen Twelvetrees), accused of \\"tapping at the window\\" and, after secretly fitting her with a wedding ring he keeps in his pocket, frees her by noting the presence of said ring (inferring she therefore could not be loitering for prostitution). He takes her home and, in a plot twist the Production Code would not allow, June stays there overnight. And every night thereafter. Cardigan's success as Attorney General makes him a likely candidate for Governor. A political kingmaker thinks it's possible and his daughter, Lillian (Jill Esmond), begins dating Cardigan. During a drunken spree, they get married and he then goes home to tell June the bad news. During his explanation, he realizes he has made a terrible mistake and that he loves June, not Lillian. Nonetheless, June leaves and Cardigan goes on a honeymoon bender for several days, alone. Meanwhile, June has returned to her old friends in the Powers mob at a bar. Unfortunately, she walks outside just in time to see Powers murder a man in cold blood. She turns and walks quickly away. Powers catches up with her and threatens to kill her unless June keeps her mouth shut. She agrees but an off-stage policeman overhears her agreement and jails her as a material witness. An Italian tenor, Mario (Albert Conti), confronts Cardigan as he is sobering up, saying he wants to marry Lillian. Breathing a sigh of relief, Cardigan says he will annul his marriage. Later, Cardigan interviews the material witness and finds it's June (who refuses to return to him, thinking he has betrayed his values so he can become Governor). She adamantly maintains she did not see the murder so he releases her as a witness. At Powers' trial, the defense springs June as a surprise witness, forcing her to admit that she could see the killer but didn't see the murder and didn't recognize Powers. Shocking his assistants, Cardigan decides not to cross-examine her. Powers laughs heartily, stopping Cardigan in his tracks. The Attorney General then withdraws his waiver, whispering \\"that laugh is going to cost you your neck\\" to Powers and promptly badgers and confuses June so that she blurts out an identification of Powers as the killer. Begging the court's indulgence, Cardigan abruptly announces that his assistants will handle the rest of the case. He then confesses that he had been sent to reform school‚Äîwith Powers‚Äîfor burglary and will therefore not run for governor, returning to his defense attorney status immediately. (Powers had threatened to blackmail him if Cardigan prosecuted him.) Outside, June congratulates him for his courage and for choosing his values over his ambition. They embrace and leave hand in hand.

Typically used with SQL statements such as queries or updates, the prepared statement takes the form of a template into which certain constant values are substituted during each execution. The typical workflow of using a prepared statement is as follows: # Prepare: At first, the application creates the statement template and sends it to the DBMS. Certain values are left unspecified, called parameters, placeholders or bind variables (labelled \\"?\\" below): #: # Then, the DBMS compiles (parses, optimizes and translates) the statement template, and stores the result without executing it. # Execute: At a later time, the application supplies (or binds) values for the parameters of the statement template, and the DBMS executes the statement (possibly returning a result). The application may execute the statement as many times as it wants with different values. In the above example, it might initially supply \\"bike\\" for the first parameter and \\"10900\\" for the second parameter, and then later supply \\"shoes\\" for the first parameter and \\"7400\\" for the second parameter. As compared to executing statements directly, prepared statements offer two main advantages: * The overhead of compiling the statement is incurred only once, although the statement is executed multiple times. However not all optimization can be performed at the time the statement template is compiled, for two reasons: the best plan may depend on the specific values of the parameters, and the best plan may change as tables and indexes change over time. * Prepared statements are resilient against SQL injection because values which are transmitted later using a different protocol are not compiled like the statement template. If the statement template is not derived from external input, SQL injection cannot occur. On the other hand, if a query is executed only once, server-side prepared statements can be slower because of the additional round-trip to the server. Implementation limitations may also lead to performance penalties; for example, some versions of MySQL did not cache results of prepared queries. A stored procedure, which is also precompiled and stored on the server for later execution, has similar advantages. Unlike a stored procedure, a prepared statement is not normally written in a procedural language and cannot use or modify variables or use control flow structures, relying instead on the declarative database query language. Due to their simplicity and client-side emulation, prepared statements are more portable across vendors.  Software support  Major DBMSs, including MySQL, Oracle, DB2, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL widely support prepared statements. Prepared statements are normally executed through a non-SQL binary protocol for efficiency and protection from SQL injection, but with some DBMSs such as MySQL prepared statements are also available using a SQL syntax for debugging purposes. A number of programming languages support prepared statements in their standard libraries and will emulate them on the client side even if the underlying DBMS does not support them, including Java's JDBC, Perl's DBI, PHP's PDO and Python's DB-API. Client-side emulation can be faster for queries which are executed only once, by reducing the number of round trips to the server, but is usually slower for queries executed many times. It resists SQL injection attacks equally effectively. Many types of SQL injection attacks can be eliminated by disabling literals, effectively requiring the use of prepared statements; only H2 supports this feature.

Note the use of \\"named parameters\\" (i.e. \`\\"@username\\"\`) rather than \`\\"?\\"\`‚Äîthis allows you to use a parameter multiple times and in any arbitrary order within the query command text. However, the AddWithValue method should not be used with variable length data types, like varchar and nvarchar. This is because .NET assumes the length of the parameter to be the length of the given value, rather than getting the actual length from the database via reflection. The consequence of this is that a different query plan is compiled and stored for each different length. In general, the maximum number of \\"duplicate\\" plans is the product of the lengths of the variable length columns as specified in the database. For this reason, it is important to use the standard Add method for variable length columns: , where ParamLength is the length as specified in the database. Since the standard Add method needs to be used for variable length data types, it is a good habit to use it for all parameter types. = Python DB-API = This example uses Python and DB-API: import mysql.connector conn = None cursor = None try: conn = mysql.connector.connect(database=\\"mysql\\", user=\\"root\\") cursor = conn.cursor(prepared=True) cursor.execute(\\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (name VARCHAR(40), price INT)\\") params = [(\\"bike\\", 10900), (\\"shoes\\", 7400), (\\"phone\\", 29500)] cursor.executemany(\\"INSERT INTO products VALUES (%s, %s)\\", params) params = (\\"shoes\\",) cursor.execute(\\"SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = %s\\", params) print(cursor.fetchall()[0][1]) finally: if cursor is not None: cursor.close() if conn is not None: conn.close() = Magic Direct SQL = This example uses Direct SQL from Fourth generation language like eDeveloper, uniPaaS and magic XPA from Magic Software Enterprises Virtual username Alpha 20 init: 'sister' Virtual password Alpha 20 init: 'yellow' SQL Command: SELECT * FROM users WHERE USERNAME=:1 AND PASSWORD=:2 Input Arguments: 1: username 2: password = PureBasic = PureBasic (since v5.40 LTS) can manage 7 types of link with the following commands SetDatabaseBlob, SetDatabaseDouble, SetDatabaseFloat, SetDatabaseLong, SetDatabaseNull, SetDatabaseQuad, SetDatabaseString There are 2 different methods depending on the type of database For SQLite, ODBC, MariaDB/Mysql use: ?

It is also known as Sugiyama- style graph drawing after Kozo Sugiyama, who first developed this drawing style.. The ideal form for a layered drawing would be an upward planar drawing, in which all edges are oriented in a consistent direction and no pairs of edges cross. However, graphs often contain cycles, minimizing the number of inconsistently-oriented edges is NP-hard, and minimizing the number of crossings is also NP-hard, so layered graph drawing systems typically apply a sequence of heuristics that reduce these types of flaws in the drawing without guaranteeing to find a drawing with the minimum number of flaws. Layout algorithm The construction of a layered graph drawing proceeds in a sequence of steps: *If the input graph is not already a directed acyclic graph, a set of edges is identified the reversal of which will make it acyclic. Finding the smallest possible set of edges is the NP-complete feedback arc set problem, so often greedy heuristics are used here in place of exact optimization algorithms.... The exact solution to this problem can be formulated using integer programming. Alternatively, if the number of reversed edges is very small, these edges can be found by a fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm.. *The vertices of the directed acyclic graph resulting from the first step are assigned to layers, such that each edge goes from a higher layer to a lower layer. The goals of this stage are to simultaneously produce a small number of layers, few edges that span large numbers of layers, and a balanced assignment of vertices to layers. For instance, by Mirsky's theorem, assigning vertices by layers according to the length of the longest path starting from each vertex produces an assignment with the minimum possible number of layers. The Coffman‚ÄìGraham algorithm may be used to find a layering with a predetermined limit on the number of vertices per layer and approximately minimizing the number of layers subject to that constraint. Minimizing the width of the widest layer is NP-hard but may be solved by branch-and-cut or approximated heuristically. Alternatively, the problem of minimizing the total number of layers spanned by the edges (without any limits on the number of vertices per layer) may be solved using linear programming.. Integer programming procedures, although more time-consuming, may be used to combine edge length minimization with limits on the number of vertices per level.. *Edges that span multiple layers are replaced by paths of dummy vertices so that, after this step, each edge in the expanded graph connects two vertices on adjacent layers of the drawing. *As an optional step, a layer of edge concentrator vertices (or confluent junctions) may be imposed between two existing vertex layers, reducing the edge density by replacing complete bipartite subgraphs by stars through these edge concentrators... *The vertices within each layer are permuted in an attempt to reduce the number of crossings among the edges connecting it to the previous layer. Finding the minimum number of crossings or finding a maximum crossing-free set of edges is NP- complete, even when ordering a single layer at a time in this way,.. so again it is typical to resort to heuristics, such as placing each vertex at a position determined by finding the average or median of the positions of its neighbors on the previous level and then swapping adjacent pairs as long as that improves the number of crossings.. Alternatively, the ordering of the vertices in one layer at a time may be chosen using an algorithm that is fixed-parameter tractable in the number of crossings between it and the previous layer.. *Each vertex is assigned a coordinate within its layer, consistent with the permutation calculated in the previous step. Considerations in this step include placing dummy nodes on a line between their two neighbors to prevent unnecessary bends, and placing each vertex in a centered position with respect to its neighbors. Sugiyama's original work proposed a quadratic programming formulation of this step; a later method of Brandes and K√∂pf takes linear time and guarantees at most two bends per edge.. *The edges reversed in the first step of the algorithm are returned to their original orientations, the dummy vertices are removed from the graph and the vertices and edges are drawn. To avoid intersections between vertices and edges, edges that span multiple layers of the drawing may be drawn as polygonal chains or spline curves passing through each of the positions assigned to the dummy vertices along the edge. Implementations In its simplest form, layered graph drawing algorithms may require O(mn) time in graphs with n vertices and m edges, because of the large number of dummy vertices that may be created. However, for some variants of the algorithm, it is possible to simulate the effect of the dummy vertices without actually constructing them explicitly, leading to a near-linear time implementation.. The \\"dot\\" tool in Graphviz produces layered drawings. A layered graph drawing algorithm is also included in Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout. and in Tulip.. Variations Although typically drawn with vertices in rows and edges proceeding from top to bottom, layered graph drawing algorithms may instead be drawn with vertices in columns and edges proceeding from left to right.. The same algorithmic framework has also been applied to radial layouts in which the graphs are arranged in concentric circles around some starting node. and to three-dimensional layered drawings of graphs.. In layered graph drawings with many long edges, edge clutter may be reduced by grouping sets of edges into bundles and routing them together through the same set of dummy vertices.. Similarly, for drawings with many edges crossing between pairs of consecutive layers, the edges in maximal bipartite subgraphs may be grouped into confluent bundles.. Drawings in which the vertices are arranged in layers may be constructed by algorithms that do not follow Sugiyama's framework. For instance, it is possible to tell whether an undirected graph has a drawing with at most k crossings, using h layers, in an amount of time that is polynomial for any fixed choice of k and h, using the fact that the graphs that have drawings of this type have bounded pathwidth.. For layered drawings of concept lattices, a hybrid approach combining Sugiyama's framework with additive methods (in which each vertex represents a set and the position of the vertex is a sum of vectors representing elements in the set) may be used. In this hybrid approach, the vertex permutation and coordinate assignment phases of the algorithm are replaced by a single phase in which the horizontal position of each vertex is chosen as a sum of scalars representing the elements for that vertex.. Layered graph drawing methods have also been used to provide an initial placement for force-directed graph drawing algorithms.

During the period of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, Radio Borovo played prominent role in the provision of relevant daily information to the local Serb community in the area of the Serb parallel entity of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. During this period it provided information on regulation of legal issues of the individual members of the community and promoted reconciliation. At that time it was formally registered in accordance with Croatian laws. In 2016 the president of the Serb National Council of the Borovo Municipality, Du≈°an Latas, expressed his ambition that Radio Borovo will one day be transformed into Serbian language redaction of the Croatian Radiotelevision.

It was launched on 24 March 2008 although had produced live radio covering the Stroud Fringe Festival many years before. The station runs as a 'not-for profit organisation' and also provides training for IT courses and radio production. In March 2009, the station marked one year of being on the airwaves. And then in March 2010, then Labour MP David Drew officially opened a new second studio at the station. In June 2011, the station launched a 'listen again' podcast service. A couple of months later however in September 2011, the station announced it was close to closure because of financial issues. As soon as the news became known the people of the Stroud area rallied to support the station with donations, sponsored swims, cake baking, bucket collections at the local Forest Green Rovers football ground, benefit gigs etc. The result was that Stroud FM won a reprieve and a breathing space in which to tackle the situation. Plans were formed at the start of 2013 to increase the broadcasting range of the station by developing a new location for a transmitter. On 12 February 2014, it was announced by their newly elected board that the station can no longer broadcast due to a lack of funding. This was the notice: Stroud FM Closing Announcement StroudFM, the local community radio station run by volunteers for the past ten years, is to close. Despite the hard work of some very dedicated people, the newly elected Board has reviewed the current financial situation and agreed unanimously that the station can no longer broadcast, due to lack of funds. There has been a considerable financial support from Stroud Town Council, local celebrities and local people over the years, and although everyone involved volunteers their time very freely ‚Äì in addition, all the StroudFM presenters and technicians pay a monthly membership fee ‚Äì all radio stations cost a substantial amount of money to run. Since broadcasting full time on 107.9 FM in March 2008, the station has helped teach unemployed people vital skills to help improve their opportunities of getting jobs. The IT facilities at the station have seen classes run for those needing support on that front as well as for the elderly to learn computer skills. Schools and youth organisations have also benefited from training with the station including recovering addicts. In March 2010 former Stroud and Labour MP, David Drew, officially opened a brand new second studio at the station with the help of a grant paying for this to take place. StroudFM's other highlights include: ‚Ä¢ Live broadcasts from the Stroud Fringe Festival ‚Ä¢ Coverage of local elections ‚Ä¢ Regular outside broadcast of match commentaries at Forest Green Rovers ‚Ä¢ A listen again service ‚Äì and online streaming, meaning listeners around the country could also listen A spokesman from StroudFM said: ‚ÄúOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Open House, Forrest Green, Stroud Town Council and Stroud District Council, as well as many local businesses for their considerable support over the years, to our listeners both in and outside Stroud, and of course to those volunteers who have given their time and energy.\\" \\"At its peak, the station was reaching out to over 1,000 listeners, both live and online.

Spanish Piece of Eight, used widely as currency in Colonial America and the ancestor of American coinage Paper money would not be printed by the United States until 1861. American coinage (1792 - c. 1837) The Coinage Act of 1792 established the United States Mint and regulated the coinage of the United States. at Jstor The act created coins in the denominations of Half Cent (1/200 of a dollar), Cent (1/100 of a dollar, or a cent), Half Dime (also known as a half disme) (five cents), Dime (also known as a disme) (10 cents), Quarter (25 cents), Half Dollar (50 cents), Dollar, Quarter Eagle ($2.50), Half Eagle ($5), and Eagle ($10). The first coin minted under the act, and therefore the first official coin of the United States, was the half disme. According to legend these first half disme coins were minted from Martha Washington's silverware. The half cent and cent were made of pure copper, the half dime, dime, quarter, half, and dollar in 90% silver, and the quarter, half and full eagle in .9167 gold (later changed to .8992 in 1834, and then 90% gold in 1837). All of the coins featured Liberty on the front and a bald eagle on the back. This period of coinage covers several designs. The Draped Bust design was featured on all copper and silver coins minted between 1796-1807. On silver coins other than the dollar this design was followed by the Capped Bust. In the early days, often years went by without a certain denomination being minted. Seated Liberty era and introduction of the Double Eagle, Nickel and small cent (1836 - 1891) Seated Liberty dollar United States Seated Liberty coinage was the silver coin design minted in the mid-to- late 19th century. It was the first seated-portrait U.S. coin, now-scarce Seated Liberty Dollar, and debuted in 1836. The seated liberty dime and seated liberty half dime followed the next year in 1837 and the seated liberty quarter and seated liberty half dollar in 1839. In 1849, in the wake of the California Gold Rush, the Double Eagle, or $20 gold denomination was added This coin contains nearly a pure ounce of gold and were minted in large quantities; many still exist today and are used as bullion coins and command only a modest premium over spot price, though many dates are rare as well. The Liberty Head Double Eagle was minted up to 1907. Rising copper prices caused the reduction of the size of the large cent. Originally, cent coins were large and heavy. This changed between 1856 and 1857 when they were replaced by the small-sized Flying Eagle cent, which was made of 88% copper and 12% nickel, and had a somewhat pale brown color. In 1859 this was replaced by the Indian Head cent, and by 1864, the Civil War increased nickel and copper prices and the cent was made thinner and the nickel removed; the cent was thus now a small, thin bronze coin. The five cent nickel coin was introduced in 1866, and gradually it made the half dime obsolete. To this day, the nickel, though the design has changed, retains the same metallic content it had from its inception: ~25% nickel, ~75% copper. The second half of the 19th century saw several odd coin denominations. The two cent piece was minted from 1864 to 1873. It was the first American coin to display the phrase In God We Trust, a result of the increased wartime religiosity during the Civil War. Three cent pieces made of silver, and later copper-nickel, were also made around this era. From 1875 to 1878, Twenty cent pieces were made in the Seated Liberty design. A Three-dollar piece of gold was minted from 1854 to 1889. In 1878, the first Morgan Silver Dollars were minted; this series lasted until 1904 and was revived for several months in 1921. Turn of the 20th century coinage, the introduction of paper money and the end of gold coins (1892 - 1932) A mercury dime The year 1892 saw the designs of Charles E. Barber adorn the dime, quarter and half dollar. His Liberty Head nickel had debuted in 1883, and thus from the years 1892 to 1904, his designs were featured on every denomination from 5 cents up to one dollar. The Barber design would last on dimes and quarters up to 1916, on half dollars up to 1915, and on the nickel up to the extremely rare and famous 1913 Liberty Head nickels. Federal Reserve Notes were issued for the first time in 1917. Originally, these were backed by gold, and a note could be, at least in theory, exchanged for gold coin at a bank until 1933 when gold was confiscated from the general public. Silver certificates were exchangeable for silver coin up to June 1968. The design of the American One dollar bill has stayed almost the same since 1935, and the other denominations had a similar appearance until their redesign in the late 1990s. The Gold Eagle was re-designed in 1907 as the Indian Head eagle and the $2.50 and $5 pieces followed in 1908. The Liberty Head Double Eagle was replaced with the St. Gaudens Double Eagle in 1907. The wheat penny, with the head of Lincoln on the obverse, was introduced in 1909. The wheat penny was the first American coin that featured the face of an actual person (rather than Liberty). Also, the Buffalo nickel and Mercury dime were both introduced in the 1910s (1913 and 1916, respectively). The Peace Dollar was minted from 1921 to 1935. After 1935, no more silver dollars would be minted for circulation by the US Mint. 90% silver dimes, quarters and half dollars were replaced with copper-nickel coins after 1964. From 1965 to 1976, 40% silver coins were issued in certain denominations. Of these, only the 1965 to 1969 dated Kennedy Half Dollars were minted for general circulation. No precious metals were present in any coins issued after 1977 by the US Mint until the bullion and commemorative series that began in the 1980s and continue to the present day. Mid-to-late 20th century and the end of silver coinage (1933 - c. 1998) Reverse side of a Franklin Half Dollar As there were no more gold coins or silver dollars after the Executive Order 6102 of 1933 minted in the United States, paper notes took place of the coin denominations above 50 cents. Up to 1964, dimes, quarters and half dollars were still minted in 90% silver; halves would contain 40% silver from 1965 to 1970. The new tradition of placing past presidents and Founding Fathers on coins, which had begun with the 1909 Lincoln cent, continued in the 1930s and 1940s, with the introduction of the Washington quarter in 1932, the Jefferson nickel in 1938, the Roosevelt dime in 1946, and the Franklin half dollar in 1948. The original Washington quarter design remained unchanged, aside from the removal of silver content and finer details, up to 1998, the Jefferson nickel up to 2003, and the Roosevelt dime to the present day. The Franklin half was replaced by the John F. Kennedy half dollar in 1964 to commemorate him after his murder. The composition of the Kennedy half dollar was changed from 90% silver to 40% silver in 1965 and remained that way through 1970. After 1970, Kennedy half dollars were made of the same copper-nickel alloy as the other denominations. The last 90% silver circulated coins are dated 1964, though they were actually minted for several years later dated as 1964. In 1982, the penny had most of its copper content removed, and is now made primarily of zinc, with a thin copper plating. The paper money of the United States was re-designed to deter counterfeit through the late 1990s and early to mid-2000s. Contemporary (1999 to present) Sacagawea Dollar reverse American coinage and paper money has gone through significant changes since the late 1990s. Up to the mid-1990s, American money had changed little since the end of silver coins in the mid-1960s, and some of the denominations, including the paper notes and the nickel, had barely changed since the 1930s. Beginning in 1996 with the $100 and $50 bills, paper money was redesigned to deter counterfeiting. In 1999, the State Quarter program ended the classic design of the Washington quarter. Next came the 2004 nickels, meant to commemorate Lewis and Clark's 200th anniversary. The cent was re-designed in 2009 to commemorate Abraham Lincoln's 200th birthday. After 2009, the Shield Penny design, representing how Lincoln preserved the Union, appeared on the reverse of pennies. The dollar coin returned in 1999, in a case very similar to the 1921 Morgan dollar, with the Susan B. Anthony dollar, to fill in until the Sacagawea dollar came about in 2000. Concurrent is the Presidential dollar series, which ended its production in the fall of 2016. The American Innovation dollar was introduced in late 2018.

Jinfo Shan is an isolated mountain with cliffs up to 300 m surrounding its relatively flat top. Its major vegetation types include subtropical broadleaf forest, coniferous forests and subalpine meadow. Besides typical karst topography of gorges, stone forests and cave systems, Jinfo Shan is well known for its exceptional plant diversity of 4768 seed plants. It is also a refuge to endangered animals confined to karst regions such as Francois Langur Trachypithecus francoisi. With its outstanding karst features and superb biodiversity, Jinfo Shan has been listed as a tentative World Heritage site since 2001. Geography Mt. Jinfo is a syncline mountain. The platform and terrace are composed of Permian limestone in the upper part with about 2000m a.s.l. In the meanwhile, karst geomorphologies in large scale on the surface or underground are found. The shale and sandstone of Silurian lay in the middle of Jinfo from 1000m to 1500m asl.. The low part of Jinfo is supported by the limestone and dolomite of Cambrian and Ordovician.

Location and population  The village of Silz and winter sport resort of K√ºhtai The 1622 hunting lodge (left) with a new building (right) The village is located at a height of around 2,020 metres and is one of the highest ski resorts in Austria.  History  Originally there was a schwaighof here, the Chutay (\\"cown alp\\"). This was first mentioned around 1280 in an urbarium of the counts of Tyrol. In 1497 the later Emperor Maximilian I was give the right to hunt in the area of the K√ºhtai. In 1622, Archduke Leopold V had the schwaighof converted into a hunting lodge and, in 1624, a road was built from Sellrain. Emperor Franz Joseph I bought the hunting lodge back in 1893 and used it as a base for hunting Alpine marmots. The property passed via his granddaughter, Hedwig to the counts of Stolberg- Stolberg, who turned it into a winter sports hotel. In 2016 it was modernised by its new owners. As early as the 1930s climbers and summer holidaymakers stayed at K√ºhtai. The hunting lodge was converted in the 19th century into a schloss hotel. The increasing number of skiers in the early 20th century soon reached Austria-Hungary and, along with that, the K√ºhtai. Under the direction of the k.u.k. Works and Farming Ministry (Arbeits- und Ackerbauministerium) the place was opened up as a ski resort in 1909. After the Second World War, K√ºhtai grew rapidly into a hotel village and is today a popular hiking and skiing area. In 1976/77 the church was built. In the course of the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, the village hosted snowboarding and freestyle competitions. At the end of December 2014, the women's 2014/15 Alpine Ski World Cup took place here for the first time (as a replacement for the cancelled competition in Semmering).

It was specifically created for the production of works under this director, but is also active in the formation of young theater arts professionals and the promotion of Lithuanian theatre tradition both at home and abroad. The institution does not have its own theater and performs heavily abroad at theatre festivals. The institution is known for its streamlined stagings, heavy on metaphor, with most of its stories based on known plays, including major works by Shakespeare, Anton Chekov and Fyodor Dostoyevsky. These productions are an extension of Nekro≈°ius's directing career which began in the 1970s. The institution Meno fortas was formed in 1998 as a private, non-profit institution by Eimuntas Nekro≈°ius, Nade≈æda Gultiajeva and The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Lithuania. (shorthis) The name translates to ‚Äúfortress of art,‚Äù and applies to the Vilnius-based production facility as well as the theater company. The focus of the institution is to produce works created and/or directed by Lithuanian director Eimuntas Nekro≈°ius in Lithuania and abroad. Most of these works represent Lithuanian theatrical tradition and are promoted by the company to a wider audience. However, it also works to on collaborative projects with other institutions, training young theater artists, organize various types of cultural events financed by both public and private monies. Meno Fortas has been a member of the Union of the Theatres of Europe since 2000. There are different artists working constantly in the studio, chamber concerts and performances are taking place here as well. After 2007, the group added chamber theatre to its repertoire. Meno Fortas does not have its own building, but rather rents space for its offices and rehearsal rooms and performances are held in rented theatres. The company performs about fifty times a year outside of the country, mostly of works such as Song of Songs, The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis and the Shakespeare trilogy of Hamlet, Macbeth and Othello. The group is part of strong theatre scene in that exists in the capital of Vilnius despite the country's poverty. It also has a very strong tradition of the theater being dominated by its directors.  Eimuntas Nekro≈°ius Eimuntas Nekro≈°ius, born 1952, is a graduate of the Lunacharsky Art Institute (today Russian Academy of Theatre Arts) in Moscow. He began is directing career as the ‚Äúenfant terrible‚Äù of the Vilnus State Youth Theater, working there from 1978 to 1991, with a short stint from 1979 to 1980 at the Kaunas National Drama Theatre. During the Soviet era, major works that he produced include such as The Square by Yeliseyeva in 1980, Love and Death in Verona by Antanƒólis and Geda (1982), Pirosmani, Pirosmani, A Day Longer Than a Hundred Years by Aitmatov (1983) and Uncle Vanya by Chekhov (1986). Of these the two most important were The Square and Uncle Vanya. In the first, life in prison was measured by counting sugar cubes, which audiences interpreted as a metaphor for Soviet life and in the latter, Astrov's maps were tiny postage stamps, which Yelena viewed through a very large magnifying screen. This performance of Uncle Vanya broke the tradition of staging this play set by Constantin Stanislavski . His performances produced by the LIFE Festival include Mozart and Salieri, Don Juan, Plague by Pushkin (1994), Three Sisters by Chekhov (1995) and Love and Death in Verona (1996), all of which were also presented at various international theater festivals. This work popularized a new trend in Lithuanian theatre based on poetry and metaphor, with the main focus on psychology and emotion with relatively plastic acting. Scenery, while sparse, is important to give multiple layers to the use of metaphor. Nekro≈°ius has continued with this style of production as founder and director of Meno Fortas, founded 1998. The director has received a number of awards for his work include best stage director of the year by Lithuanian Critique, the New Reality in Europe Theater by the Europe Theater Union and the Taormina Art Festival committee and the UBU Premium of Italy. Productions and performances Menos Forte has continued with Nekro≈°ius streamlined, metaphoric staging. One example of this style is seen in the group's production of Faust. Its depiction of Faust is marked by the main character slowly walking downstage as other actors are flicking ropes to makes waves in yellow light. When in the middle of them, he panics, grabs his heart and falls. The ropes then cover Faust. Meno Forte's shows are financed as international co-productions and are presented more often abroad than in Lithuania. One of its signature pieces, Hamlet, actually precedes the group as it was first performed at the LIFE Festival in 1997, being performed there for five year in a row. However, the characteristics of this piece would define Meno Fortas, as it starred a Lithuanian pop singer in the title role and featured a huge, melting chandelier made of ice hovering over the scene. The piece has been performed by the group in nearly all of Europe's main theatre festivals, winning many awards. Macbeth was created after the formation of the theater group, premiering in 1999. In 2001, Othello was first premiered at the Venice Biennale, followed by the first opera Macbeth at the Teatro Comunale in Florence. The three Shakespeare pieces, Hamlet, Macbeth and Othello are heavily dependent on the performance of the actor in the title role. This reliance on a single main actor has forced the company to cancel shows when this actor cannot perform. Other productions include a version of Pedro Calder√≥n's La vida es sue√±o with the Compa√±√≠a Estable of Colombia, Cornamusa, SA of Mexico and Teatro 4 of Argentina. In 2003, the company created a production called The Seasons, based on an epic poem by Lithuanian writer Kristijonas Donelaitis. In the same year, a production of Anton Chekov's The Cherry Orchard was produced with Russian actors. In 2004, the company produced a play based on the Old Testament called The Song of Songs, and the Cherry Orchard received the top prize at the Golden Mask Festival in Moscow. In 2005, two operas were produced called the Children of Rosenthal by Leonid Desyatnikov at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow and Boris Godunov at the Teatro Comunale in Florence. Another major work by the group is called Faust, base on the version by Johan Wolfgang. This piece has been performed for various years in various countries including the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico. Another 2006 production is Valkyrie, based on the musical piece by Richard Wagner, and which was staged at the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theater in 2007. In 2008, the company performed Anna Karenina at the Emilia Romagna Teatro in Modena and an opera called The Legend of Invisible city of Kitez, at the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari and Bolshoi Theater. The most recent production by the company include a large scale show based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky‚Äôs The Idiot.

The bronze statue sculpted by Francis Chantrey in the United Kingdom in 1834 and shipped to Madras in 1839, is one of the popular landmarks in Chennai. The absence of stirrups is one of the peculiarities of the statue and for this reason, it is also referred to as \\"The Stirrupless Majesty\\".  Thomas Munro  A portrait of Sir Thomas Munro Thomas Munro was one of the most popular British administrators in South India. Born in Glasgow in 1761, Munro arrived in India as a soldier in 1789 and fought with distinction in the Anglo-Mysore Wars. At the end of the war, he served as a settlement officer in Canara and later, Bellary. He also fought in the Pindari War (1817). In 1820, Munro was appointed Governor of Madras and served till his death from cholera in 1827. Munro is credited with having introduced the Ryotwari System in South India and drafting an education policy for the Madras Presidency. He also supported a larger share for natives in the administration of India. Munro is the subject of a number of folk tales and ballads and is even worshipped by some.  Death of Thomas Munro  Munro's term as Governor of Madras came to an end in 1826. As there was a delay in appointing a new Governor, Munro decided to visit the Ceded Districts of the Madras Presidency, where he had served as a settlement officer in the early 19th century, in the meantime. As he was riding through the hills of Cuddapah District along with a mixed retinue of Europeans and Indians, Munro observed a golden, thread-like glow across two hills. He remarked His followers were perplexed as the garland was not visible to anyone. At length, an old Indian in the retinue reportedly replied, with sorrow: After spending a few days at Ananthapur, Thomas Munro and his party reached Gooty on 4 July 1827. At Gooty, some of his men were afflicted with cholera. Two days later, at Pattikonda, Munro caught cholera from his men and had to be nursed. His condition deteriorated in the evening and he died at half-past-nine on 6 July 1827. Munro was buried at a graveyard in Gooty. In April 1831, his remains were transported to Madras and interred in the St. Mary's Church, Fort St. George.  Construction  A three- dimensional view of the statue When the news of Munro's death reached Madras, it was mourned by all classes of people in the city. The government issued a Gazette Extraordinary on 9 July 1827 with the message: A public meeting was soon held in his memory in Madras city in which was made a proposal to erect a statue to Munro through public subscription. The Madras government opened a memorial for Munro in the town of Pattikonda where he had died. A choultry called \\"Munro Choultry\\" was erected in Gooty in his honour. A total of nine thousand pounds (¬£8000, according to some sources) were collected through public subscription and the British sculptor Francis Chantrey was commissioned to make the statue. Chantrey completed the statue in 1834 \\\\- one of the three equestrian statues sculpted by him. According to a popular belief, the Duke of Wellington, on seeing the completed statue, had exclaimed The statue, weighing six tonnes, was shipped to India in three parts and erected at The Island, Chennai in 1839 atop a granite plinth made by Ostheider & Co of Calcutta. The statue was ceremonially opened on 23 October 1839.  Architecture  Thomas Munro and his horse Sir. Thomas Munro's Statue, Madras (MacLeod, p.124, 1871) The statue depicts Thomas Munro riding a horse. In doing so, Chantrey had opted to follow, for commemorative purposes, the prevalent Western practice of portraying authority. It is believed that Chantrey might have modelled the statue upon his own earlier work of George IV at Trafalgar Square, London. This might have been intended to elevate Munro above the Indians whose cause he championed. Chantrey was, initially, caught in a dilemma over the choice of steed.Jones, pp 87-88 While some of his friends and visitors suggested a classic horse, some suggested an Arabian, others a war horse. Eventually, Chantrey chose an Arab, similar to the one he had sculpted for his statue of George IV. One particular biography of Francis Chantrey considered the sculpture of Thomas Munro to be the finest among Chantrey's works and the horse, his worst ever. The combined height of the horse and the rider is more than 15 feet. The horse gazes calmly while Munro strikes a thoughtful pose, both still, yet ready to lunge forward into motion.  Peculiarity  The peculiarity of the statue is the absence of a saddle as well as the stirrups. While some feel that the omission is due to an oversight on the part of the sculptor, others feel that the saddle and the stirrups might have been deliberately excluded keeping in mind Munro's penchant for bareback riding. Due to the absence of stirrups, the statue is also occasionally referred to as \\"The Stirrupless Majesty\\". Historical references An 1843 illustration of Munro's statue Captain Hervey has been credited with popularizing an anecdote connected with Munro's statue Proposed removal  During the World Classical Tamil Conference held in Coimbatore in 2010, there were demands to remove the statue of Thomas Munro, evoking strong protests from conservationists. Though the government had arrived at a decision to remove the statue, it has not yet been implemented.

It works by relaxing smooth muscle to widen (dilate) blood vessels, especially in the lungs. Nitric oxide is used together with a mechanical ventilator to treat respiratory failure in premature infants. Helium and oxygen Heliox ‚Äî In medicine heliox generally refers to a mixture of 21% O2 (the same as air) and 79% He, although other combinations are available. Heliox generates less airway resistance than air and thereby requires less mechanical energy to ventilate the lungs. \\"Work of Breathing\\" (WOB) is reduced. It does this by two mechanisms: # increased tendency to laminar flow; # reduced resistance in turbulent flow. Heliox has a similar viscosity to air but a significantly lower density (0.5 g/l versus 1.2 5g/l at STP). Flow of gas through the airways comprises laminar flow, transitional flow and turbulent flow. The tendency for each type of flow is described by the Reynolds number. Heliox's low density produces a lower Reynolds number and hence higher probability of laminar flow for any given airway. Laminar flow tends to generate less resistance than turbulent flow. In the small airways where flow is laminar, resistance is proportional to gas viscosity and is not related to density and so heliox has little effect. The Hagen‚ÄìPoiseuille equation describes laminar resistance. In the large airways where flow is turbulent, resistance is proportional to density, so heliox has a significant effect. Heliox has been used medically since the early 1930s. It was the mainstay of treatment in acute asthma before the advent of bronchodilators. Currently, heliox is mainly used in conditions of large airway narrowing (upper airway obstruction from tumors or foreign bodies and vocal cord dysfunction). There is also some use of heliox in conditions of the medium airways (croup, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Patients with these conditions may suffer a range of symptoms including dyspnea (breathlessness), hypoxemia (below-normal oxygen content in the arterial blood) and eventually a weakening of the respiratory muscles due to exhaustion, which can lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Heliox may reduce all these effects, making it easier for the patient to breathe. Heliox has also found utility in the weaning of patients off mechanical ventilation, and in the nebulization of inhalable drugs, particularly for the elderly. Research has also indicated advantages in using helium‚Äìoxygen mixtures in delivery of anaesthesia.

It extends into Shark Bay between Herald Bay to the north and Tetrodon Loop to the south, and serves as a prominent navigation point with an all-round view of the approaches to Egg Island. History The bluff was the site of a small garrison placed there by the Governor of Western Australia in 1850 to protect the guano deposits on Egg Island and other small islands nearby from being illegally exploited by foreign vessels while it was being legally mined. The garrison of 15 soldiers of the 99th Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant L.R. Elliot, arrived from Champion Bay in October and established a camp, named Irwin Station, consisting of a wooden building and tents. They subsequently constructed at least one building from local stone. They were armed with two cannons emplaced at the top of the bluff with a clear view of the bay. A 100 m stone jetty was built into Herald Bay at the same time, the remains of which are now submerged at high tide. The camp was moved in May and, as the guano deposits were becoming exhausted, the garrison was recalled to Fremantle in July 1851.

The demarcation of borders between the Safavid Shah Safi and the Ottoman caliph Sultan Murad IV in 1639 effectively divided Kurdistan between the two empires. The eyalet of Diyarbakir was the center of the major and minor Kurdish chiefdoms. However, other Kurdish emirates existed outside of Diyarbakir.

Life Wansey was the son of George and Esther Wansey of Warminster, Wiltshire.Wiltshire, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages and Burials, 1538-1812 He was a member of the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society, in which he served the office of vice-president, and in connection with which he published in 1780 A Letter to the Marquis of Lansdowne on the Subject of the Late Tax on Wool, in which he pointed out the policy mistakes in the tax, and maintained that commercial restrictions of such a nature were generally injurious. In 1789, Wansey was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, in 1794 he visited the United States, and in 1796 he published his observations under the title An Excursion to the United States of America, Salisbury; 2nd edit. 1798. While residing at Salisbury in 1801 he turned his attention to the condition of poorhouses, and published in that year a pamphlet entitled Thoughts on Poorhouses, particularly that of Salisbury, with a view to their reform. Wansey, however, principally occupied himself with the study of local antiquities, and for some years he laboured in conjunction with Sir Richard Colt Hoare in preparing the account of the hundred of Warminster for Hoare's History of Wiltshire. The volume containing Wansey's labours was not, however, published until 1831, four years after his death. Wansey died at Warminster on 19 July 1827. By his wife Elizabeth he had one daughter, Emma, who died in childhood. Other works Besides the works referred to, Wansey was the author of: * Wool encouraged without Exportation, published by the Highland Society of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1791. * A Letter to the Bishop of Salisbury on his late Charge to the Clergy of his Diocese, London, 1798. * A Visit to Paris in June 1814, London, 1814.

It is part of the global Cash Cab franchise that originated in the United Kingdom.

The programme airs on the Australian subscription television music channel, Channel V. A parody of this show has appeared on Balls of Steel Australia which is also hosted by Kerley.  Format  Contestants are asked several trivia questions (mainly music questions) in various verbal, audio and video based questions for the duration of their taxi trip. After being asked 5 questions, players are asked to choose The Loot or the Boot. Contestants have the opportunity to keep \\"the loot\\" they have won so far, or trade it all, depending on how many questions they answered correctly, for what is in \\"the boot\\". Boot prizes may be worth substantially more or substantially less than their current winnings. By choosing \\"the boot,\\" the contestant's winnings are reset to $0 and the prize is theirs to keep, even if they use up their three strikes. On rare occasions, the host may give an opportunity to the contestant to win some of their money back by doing a 30-second dare relating to their substantially less valuable \\"boot\\" prize. Contestants are entitled to two \\"Shout Outs\\", one 30 second phone call to a friend on the phone (a \\"Mobile Shout-Out\\") or to ask a passer-by off the street (a \\"Street Shout-Out\\") that they are travelling on. When contestants reach their destination, they are asked if they want to \\"Double or Nothing\\" in which they can choose to walk away with what cash they have won, or to sit and watch a video clip and be asked an observation-based question. If they answer correctly, they walk away with double the winnings of the trip. If they get it wrong, they walk away with nothing.

It is hosted by comedian Adam Growe. The game show airs in Canada instead of the American version of the series, which airs on the affiliated US Discovery Channel network. Cash Cab is the English version of the Cash Cab franchise available in Canada; the French version is called Taxi Payant, and airs on V. Game show The Canadian version closely mirrors the structure of its US counterpart, retaining familiar features like \\"Shout Outs\\", \\"Red Light Challenges\\", and the \\"double or nothing\\" Video Bonus option at the end of each game. However, the Canadian version differs in its heavier focus on questions of science, technology, nature and adventure, as opposed to purely general knowledge. Regular questions are worth $25, $50, $100; while Red Light Challenge questions are worth $75. In the second season, a third \\"life line\\" was added: when contestants reach the $100 questions, they have the option to \\"swap out\\" a question, and the Cash Cab dispatcher will give them a new question. In the Cash Cab Vancouver season, bridge bonus was added, which doubles the score for the current question once per session. After returning to Toronto, a high five bonus was added, which doubles the score for the fifth correct answer in a row. The 8th season and last season of Cash Cab aired in 2015, which features a new \\"Triple Play\\" component, where contestants have a chance to triple their winnings if they go for the Video Bonus Question, and only if they arrive at their destination strike-free. Over 200 episodes have been completed, plus a one-hour special. All episodes of Cash Cab were shot in Canadian cities, with all but 1 season of 26 episodes filmed in downtown Toronto. Season 5 was shot in Vancouver in the summer of 2011. The cab used is a Toyota Sienna minivan. History Following the success of the first season, Canada's host Adam Growe was invited to host a special season premiere episode of the American Cash Cab on December 23, 2008, which promoted the feature film Frost/Nixon. For a brief period in summer 2009, Cash Cab was broadcast in a programming block with Qubit. On July 16, 2011, a 61-year-old man from Surrey, British Columbia was struck and killed in downtown Vancouver by a vehicle used for the Canadian version of Cash Cab.

Rules Unlike most international versions, the value of each question is based on the number of correct answers, instead of the number of questions asked: * The first 2 correct answers are each worth 10,000 yen, for a running total of 20,000 yen. * The next 3 correct answers are each worth 20,000 yen, for a running total of 80,000 yen. * The next 4 correct answers are each worth 30,000 yen, for a running total of 200,000 yen. * Each subsequent correct answer is worth 50,000 yen, up to a maximum running total of 500,000 yen after 15 total correct answers. The show uses video game-style \\"lives\\" instead of strikes; players start with three lives and lose one with each incorrect answer, and losing all three prompts the driver to pull over and kick the players out empty-handed. =Chances= Players are given three \\"Rescue Chances\\", which are the counterpart to the US and Canadian versions' \\"Shout-Outs\\": * Asking Chance: The cab pulls over and players are given the opportunity to ask passers-by the question, much like the Street Shout-Out. * Telephone Chance: Players may call a friend on a mobile phone, like the Mobile Shout-Out. * Bookstore Chance: The cab pulls over in front of the nearest bookstore, and the players get to go inside and pick one book to buy, which they may then use to look up the answer. Players must pay for the book at their own expense. At the end of the game, contestants are offered a \\"Double-Up Chance\\" similar to the US and Canadian versions' Video Bonus, where they may risk their winnings on a final double-or-nothing question. If the players opt to take the chance, they pick one of three envelopes, each containing a different question which may vary greatly in difficulty. Like international versions, correctly answering the question doubles the player's winnings, while failing to do so means the player leaves empty-handed.

It is the story of a lady of 17th century England who finds herself cast from nobility when her father is accused of treason and murdered. As a noose rests at her neck, her one regret is that she did not have a chance to find his killer. She is once again given that chance when Lord Chatham, hoping to use the lady to solve the murder of his wife, takes her hand in marriage to save her from the hangman's rope. The novel consists of multiple plot lines making it more than just an average romance novel. It may also be classified under the genres of historical romance, mystery, and gothic.  Plot/setting  = Historical setting = The novel begins in 1678 during the reign of Charles II of England. = Prologue = To settle a land dispute, Lord Warwick Chatham jousts in Charles II's court against Lord Hardgrave, his long-standing enemy. Warwick wins the battle and walks to a stream for a drink of water. Here, he first sees Ondine, though he is unsure if she is real. Later in his quarters, Warwick refuses the advances of the lady Anne Fenton. Then, his wife, Genevieve, comes to him because she had a nightmare about Warwick's grandmother, who met a suspicious death. Warwick assures her that he will protect her, yet he is too late to save her as she falls from the window later. Warwick is convinced that she was murdered, but Charles II believes she committed suicide. A year later, Warwick is traveling to his home in North Lambria when he meets a death procession. After asking his coachman, Jake, if it is true that a woman can be saved from the gallows if someone takes her in marriage, he tells him to follow the procession. = Part I, Ondine = Warwick does not recognize Ondine as the woman he saw in the water only a year before. Ondine is on her way to be hanged for poaching an animal on a lord's property. In the last minutes of her life, Ondine regrets that she could not find the traitor who killed her father and would've killed her had she not run away. She thinks it too good to be true when Warwick saves Ondine from the hangman's rope by marrying her. Her only thought is of leaving him, but after trying to escape once, she realizes that being Warwick's wife can provide her with the protection she needs to devise a plan to clear her father's name. Through constant bickering with Warwick, she is able to play the part of his wife in front of his brother and the servants. Ondine is, however, constantly plagued by nightmares of her father's death by the hands of her step uncle, William, and cousin, Raoul, who threatened to incriminate her as well if she did not marry Raoul. She is also frustrated by her new husband's lack of communication with her about his family history. She learns that his grandmother is rumored to have been murdered by his grandfather's mistress. Later, she discovers that Mathilda was the daughter of her grandfather's affair, and Clinton is Mathilda's son. Warwick constantly dismisses Ondine's temper and frustrations. He tells everyone that she is pregnant hoping to lure out his wife's killer. Ondine knows something else is going on after she hears a voice whispering her name in bedchamber. Overshadowing this fear is the prospect of going to court with Warwick because she does not want to be recognized as a traitor. Despite their bickering, Warwick and Ondine both see glimpses of good in each other and are falling in love. = Part II, The Countess of North Lambria The Game Is Played = Ondine's fear of going to King Charles II's court is unfounded. As soon as Charles II and her have a moment alone, he informs her that he believes her innocent of treason and encourages her to play Warwick's game then return home to clear her father's name. She plays the game very well much to Warwick's dismay. He becomes jealous of the attention she is giving the king, while she becomes jealous of the Lady Anne's attention to Warwick. Their mutual feelings of frustration result in their finally consummating their marriage. Once back in the Chatham manor, Ondine is attacked by a hooded figure in a mask and pushed into the family tomb. Not sure whom to suspect, Warwick plans another trip to court to lure out the killer. Anne and Lord Hardgrave reveal the truth of Warwick and Ondine's marriage, but Warwick gives a loving speech that has everyone enchanted, not revolted, with the love story. On an outing, Ondine is snatched away by pirates. She suspects Anne and Lord Hardgrave, but there is no proof. After saving Ondine, Warwick immediately rushes her back to the Chatham manor and announces that he will be divorcing Ondine and sending her away the next morning. Ondine is constantly confused by Warwick's actions because she doesn't know that he truly loves her and is pushing her away to protect her. That night, Mathilda drugs Ondine and attempts to hang herself and Ondine to right the history of the family to quiet the ghosts that haunt her mind. She succeeds in killing herself, but Warwick arrives in time to save Ondine. Warwick has changed his mind about sending Ondine away, but she doesn't know this. Ondine leaves the next morning for her home in Rochester to try to clear her father's name. = Part III, The Duchess of Rochester Full Circle = Ondine returns to her home, Deauveau Place, in the hopes of finding the forged papers that incriminate her and her father. Her step uncle, William, is wary of her, but Raoul is pleased to see her. Ondine agrees to wed Raoul in one month. In the meantime, Warwick has visited Charles II and learned the truth of Ondine's secret. Warwick plans to find a way to stay close to Ondine, and Charles II says that he will plan a visit to Deauveau Place as well. That night Ondine searches William's study but doesn't find anything. After becoming violently ill twice in one night, she realizes she is carrying Warwick's child. At a nearby tavern, Warwick, Clinton, Justin, and Jake inquire about the Deauveau Place. They learn that William is looking for a blacksmith. Warwick decides to apply for the position. Clinton and Justin are to return to court to see if they can find any witnesses to Ondine's father's death, and Jake will stay at the tavern to see what more he can learn. Ondine continues her search for the documents with no luck. Knowing that William wants a physician to examine her, Ondine tells Raoul that while she was gone she had married a peasant. Knowing that she has bought herself some time, she breathes easier until Warwick visits her in her room that night, and she is renewed with fear by the danger he presents to the both of them by being there. Things escalate rapidly after William discovers that Ondine is pregnant. Anne overhears Clinton and Justin speaking to a witness to Ondine's father's murder, and she and Lord Hardgrave immediately set in motion a plan to pay William for Ondine so that Anne may have Warwick to herself. Hardgrave, however, plans to kill Warwick. Jake witnesses their meeting at the tavern and is able to warn Warwick. On the day this is supposed to happen, Ondine meets Warwick so that they may leave together. Raoul walks in on them as they embrace and shoots Warwick. William takes Ondine just as Hardgrave approaches. Hardgrave goes to see Warwick's corpse for himself. Warwick, however, is not dead, and they duel. Warwick kills Hardgrave. In the meantime, Ondine has escaped from William and ran to the woods. Raoul, Warwick, and William follow. Justin and Clinton arrive and follow as well. Raoul refuses to fight Warwick, so William kills his own son; then, Warwick kills William and takes Ondine back into her home to recover. The king arrives, and Ondine learns that the witness has come forward to clear her father's name. The Chatham men and the king go to the tavern where Anne is staying, and the king forces her to marry a governor on a remote Caribbean island. = Epilogue = Some months later, Warwick and Ondine welcome a baby boy into the world.  Characters  * Lord Warwick Chatham ‚Äì a lord set on discovering the truth behind his wife's death, weds Ondine and falls in love with her * Ondine ‚Äì a lady thrown from nobility by the accusation and murder of her father, weds Warwick and falls in love with him * King Charles II ‚Äì Warwick's king and friend, believes Ondine to be innocent * Lord Hardgrave ‚Äì Warwick's neighbor and enemy * Genevieve ‚Äì Warwick's wife, who meet an untimely death at the beginning of the novel * Jake ‚Äì Warwick's personal servant and trusted friend * Anne Fenton ‚Äì Warwick occasional lover, a woman he loves to hate * Mathilda ‚Äì head housekeeper of the Chatham manor, Warwick's illegitimate aunt * Justin Chatham ‚Äì Warwick's charming younger brother * Clinton ‚Äì master of the stables at the Chatham manor, Warwick's illegitimate cousin * Jem ‚Äì the valet for Deauveau Place, loves Ondine like a daughter and believes her father innocent * Raoul ‚Äì Ondine's step cousin, who conspires against her father and whom she is set to marry later in the novel as she tries to clear her father's name * William ‚Äì Ondine's step uncle, who conspires against her father and who forces her engagement to his son, Raoul * Berta ‚Äì the help that William assigns as Ondine's maid upon her return to Deauveau Place  Themes  = Nobility/social status = The theme of nobility and social status is evident throughout the novel. Ondine finds herself cast from nobility, going from a lady of leisure to a beggar on the street. Before Warwick knows Ondine's true identity, he treats her like less of person. Once he finds out that she is nobility, his views of her change significantly. Before Warwick learns her true identity, Ondine is exceedingly frustrated with the idea of her lowering in social status. \\"She wanted to cry out that she was a duchess in her own right, that she should have been able to spit at her arrogant earl of a husband's sharply voiced order\\". The roles are reversed later in the novel when Ondine is back at Deauveau Place as Duchess and Warwick gets himself hired on as the blacksmith. = Love/hate = A common plot device used in romance novels is to throw two characters together who just can't get along. Such is the case of Ondine and Warwick. Their relationship begins with each of them using the other for his/her own purpose. They argue constantly and find it impossible to even pretend to get along. As the novel progresses, however, their connection becomes stronger as they unexpectedly fall in love. It is at the end of Part I of the novel that Ondine is \\"[h]ating herself ‚Ä¶ for loving him\\").  Genre  = Romance novel = This novel, written and marketed toward the romance genre, has all of the common elements of a romance novel. Two people meet, and push each other away at first, only to have circumstances bring them back together. Along the way, they fall in love, and the ending leaves readers on a pleasant and optimistic note. = Mystery fiction = Warwick and Ondine are both trying to solve mysteries of their own. Ondine wants uncover her father's killer and clear his name, while Warwick wants to investigate his wife's death. There is also the mystery of the rumored curse surrounding Warwick's family, particularly in the instance of his grandmother's death. = Gothic fiction = There are many elements of the gothic genre present in Ondine: mysterious deaths, ghosts, secret passageways, masked figures, and darkness.  Literary allusions  = Beauty and the Beast = Warwick is often referred to as a beast, both directly and indirectly. Anne calls Warwick a beast, saying that he is too powerful for the gentle Genevieve. When Ondine is almost hanged, she tells Jake that she would marry a beast of the forest to escape death. Jake affirms that Warwick has been called a beast before. On the first night of their marriage, when Warwick realizes Ondine is trying to escape, he thinks, '\\"Beauty\\" was attempting to escape the \\"beast\\"'. Later in the novel as Warwick is watching over Ondine, it states, '\\"Sleep, my beauty,\\" he teased her gently. \\"For your 'beast' is standing guard\\"'. References such as these are present throughout the entire novel. = Ondine in mythology = In myths, Ondine refers to a water nymph or a mermaid. The first time Warwick sees Ondine, she jumps into a stream and disappears into the water. Later, he wonders if saw a mermaid or if he even truly saw anything. When Justin first meets Ondine and learns her name, he says, \\"Ever so surely a name of magical connotation, a creature of magical beauty!\\". Later in the novel, it states, \\"Ondine, a mythical creature, granted eternal life through marriage to a mortal\\". Allusions like these are present throughout the entire novel.

He was born in the village of Marjan of the region of Opar (and now part of the Maliq municipality in Kor√ß√´ County, southeastern Albania). He emigrated to Greece where he wrote in Anastas Kullurioti's weekly The Voice of Albania, (). One of his most important poems was a ballad of 150 verses entitled The Albanians who fight in Gucia. He returned to Albania and worked in Kor√ß√´ as a photographer. One of his most important photos is the one that documented the first Albanian school, opened in 1887 (the picture dates 1899). Shuli was a Protestant and close friend with Gjerasim Qiriazi, founder of the Protestant Church of Albania. For this reason he was excommunicated by the Orthodox church to whom he belonged before converting to Protestantism. When his 20-year-old son died, Kristo was left with the choice of either renouncing the Protestant faith, or bury his son outside of the Christian Orthodox cemetery of the city. He did not give up his faith and, crying, buried his son in the garden of his own house. Shuli is also known for having been the photographer of many people involved with the Rilindja movement, such as known freedom fighters Shahin Matraku and Kajo Babjeni, thereby becoming one of the propagandists of the movement itself. In 1892 Shuli went to Shkod√´r to meet with Kel Marubi and Kol√´ Idromeno with whom he shared his experience. Shuli was the brother-in-law of well-known Albanian photographer Kristaq Sotiri, who was Shuli's alumnus. Shuli was decorated post-mortem from the Albanian government for his patriotic activities.

Although called a block party, the festivities span several blocks and revelers can be found at house parties around the city. On the closest Saturday to Halloween, an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 party-goers dressed in costumes descend upon the City of Athens. The Ohio University spends roughly $90,000 a year in security and safety measures for the campus. The City of Athens brings in Police forces from surrounding counties to help with crowd control and safety.  Origins and history  The annual Halloween Block Party in Athens, Ohio began in 1974 when costumed partiers halted traffic on Court Street in uptown Athens for two hours on Halloween night. 1975 was known as the forgotten year as Homecoming and Halloween fell on the same weekend and there was no mention of an uptown block party. 1976 brought the crowds back to Court Street. In 1977 The Athens City Council passed a resolution closing Court Street to traffic and allowing an official Halloween celebration. Ohio University officials planned activities, including a costume contest, live music, and a four by eight foot cake to be served to party goers. 1978 marked the second year the block party was endorsed by the Athens City Council and University officials. Because of the high arrest numbers in 1978, the City of Athens and Ohio University dropped their sponsorship of the festivities in 1979. Despite the lack of official recognition, the block party happened anyway. The annual event continued to grow through the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs without University or City support until 1990 when the block party was recognized by the City of Athens again.  2010 block party  The 2010 Halloween Bash saw larger crowds than prior years, but arrests were down from previous years. Temperatures were mild and stages were placed at the intersections of Court St. and State St. and Court St. and Union St. Seventy eight arrests were made by the Athens Police Department between 9:30 P.M. Saturday and 3:30 A.M. Sunday. A fire was reported at the Athena Movie Theatre that caused minor damage.  Legacy  All indications point towards a continuation of the Halloween Block Party in Athens. Ohio University and the City of Athens continue to refine their plan to deal with the crowds and over the past few years arrests have been down.

Mature buds are oval to oblong or pear-shaped with a pimply surface, long and wide with a conical to rounded or beaked operculum that is much shorter than the floral cup. Flowering has been recorded in May, September and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level or enclosed below it. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus langleyi was first formally described in 1991 by Lawrie Johnson and Donald Blaxell from a specimen collected by Blaxell near Yalwal Road, Nowra and the description was published in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (langleyi) honours \\"Lawrence Langley of Robertson\\" who drew the authors' attention to the species. Distribution and habitat The green mallee ash grows in mallee shrubland in shallow, sandy soil over sandstone. It is only known from two stands south-west of Nowra. Conservation status This malled is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The population occurring north of the Shoalhaven River contained 32 plants in 1998, but a survey ten years later found only 20 of them still alive. This population is listed as \\"critically endangered\\" under the New South Wales Act. The main threats to the species are residential and recreational development and by road, trail and pipeline maintenance. In 2000, three clumps of trees were destroyed during gas pipe line constructions and others were covered in debris. Further reading * Brooker, M. and Kleinig, D.A.

History The first exact dates regarding the place go back to 8 May 1537 when the name \\"Berrier\\", the name by which the sanctuary was called, appears in a donation document. This word has Celtic origins and means ‚Äúa pile of large rocks‚Äù. Around 1690 a statue of the Virgin was placed in a protective niche there. This statue became the object of a legal dispute among the priest, the diocesan administration and a Courmayeur family, which resulted in the sanctuary's destruction.Notre Dame de Gu√©rison on the Aosta Valley tourism office website The sanctuary was re-built in 1781 by Jean-Michel Truchet, with a project approved by Courmayeur parish priest Jean-Martin Dondeynaz, and the chapel was consecrated in 1792. But the Brenva Glacier, which had been expanding since 1800, shifted the moraine that surrounded the sanctuary, causing it to collapse. On 22 May 1821 it was decided to rebuild the chapel again and, in 1840, a room was added for the caretaker: Laurent Girard, known for being one of the last Aosta Valley hermits. An increase in devotees lead to inept extension works in 1850, making the chapel unstable and subject to water infiltration so that ‚Äúwhen it rains or snows, the wall next to the rock leaks and the chapel turns into a small lake‚Äù. The present building, erected by the entrepreneur Filippo Franchini between 1867 and 1869, is characterized by a Neo-Classical style, measures slightly more than 100 sq. metres and has a Latin-cross plan. In the first half of the 20th century some rooms were added for the priest, as well as a gallery to hold the votive offerings. The present The arches and walls of the sanctuary are covered with a cycle of frescoes and three oils on canvas by the painter Giuseppe Stornone from Ivrea (1816-1890), who specialized in religious paintings of large dimension as well as vast cycles of frescoes and was influenced by the Italian baroque style. Many of the votive offerings are for alpinists who have escaped danger while climbing Mont Blanc or crossing many of its passes. There is a silver miniature model of the ship Stella Polare, a former Norwegian whaler which, in 1899, took Umberto Cagni and his crew on an unsuccessful mission to reach the North Pole. The survivors brought the model as a gift on 23 June 1901, as thanks for the sanctuary's prayers during the journey. Pope John-Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, during their summer holidays in Aosta Valley, visited the sanctuary on many occasions.Les lieux sacr√©s de Courmayeur-Mont-Blanc References Category:Religious buildings and structures in Italy Category:Buildings and structures in Aosta Valley Category:Tourist attractions in Aosta Valley ","title":"Notre Dame de Gu√©rison sanctuary"},{"id":"33213222","text":"The Devonian Brallier Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia.
