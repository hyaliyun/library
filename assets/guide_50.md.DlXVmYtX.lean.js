His biggest successes included \\"It's All Over\\" in 1964, \\"It's An Uphill Climb to the Bottom\\" in 1966 and \\"Feelings\\", a cover of the Morris Albert pop hit, in 1976. Life and career He was born in Pensacola, Florida and raised in Detroit. As a child he became ill with polio and, as a result, he used crutches for the rest of his life. He first recorded as a member of a vocal group, the Velvetones, on the Deb label in 1959 before turning solo, singing in Detroit nightclubs. After failing an audition for Motown, he was discovered performing in a club by Columbia Records' A&R; man, Carl Davis, who was impressed with his powerful voice and persuaded him to move to Chicago in 1962 and sign for the label. His first solo record, \\"I Don't Want To Suffer\\" was not a hit and, after a few more releases, he transferred to the subsidiary label, OKeh, which Davis was running. There, Jackson had his first hit with \\"It's All Over\\", written by Curtis Mayfield and produced by Mayfield and Davis, which made no. 67 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1964. Davis continued to provide songs for Jackson from such writers as Mayfield and Van McCoy and he had a string of hits on the R&B; chart in the mid-1960s, although none rose above the lower reaches of the pop charts. Among the most successful were \\"Suddenly I'm All Alone\\" (no. 13 R&B;, no. 96 pop, 1965), \\"Welcome Home\\" (no. 15 R&B;, no. 95 pop, 1965), \\"It's An Uphill Climb to the Bottom\\" (no. 11 R&B;, no. 88 pop, 1966), and \\"Speak Her Name\\" (no. 22 R&B;, no. 89 pop, 1967). Davis also promoted Jackson as an album artist and three LPs by him were released on OKeh ‚Äì It's All Over, Welcome Home (1965), and Speak Her Name (1966). The latter was produced by Columbia staff producer, Ted Cooper, following Davis' departure from the company. A greatest hits collection was also issued. He moved to Atlantic subsidiary Cotillion Records in the late 1960s and then on to the Brunswick label, with diminishing commercial success, with either Cooper or Davis producing. There were also short stays at Wand Records and small Chicago label, USA Records before, in the mid-1970s, he moved to Davis' new Chi Sound label and had one of his biggest hits with a version of Morris Albert's 1975 pop hit \\"Feelings\\". Jackson's version reached no. 9 on the R&B; chart and no. 93 on the pop chart in 1976. The following year, his version of Peter Frampton's \\"Baby, I Love Your Way\\" reached no. 19 on the R&B; chart, but later releases were less successful. Jackson died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1983 at the age of 45, a few days after the release of what proved to be his final single.

The Beaux-Arts and Classical Revival building, sporting Ionic and Doric columns and rich in ornamental detail has undergone expansion and renovation since its 1904 opening. It is one of New Jersey's original thirty-six Carnegie libraries, constructed with a grant of $83,000 made April 13, 1903 by the Carnegie Corporation, still in use. In 1913, Andrew Carnegie donated another $30,000 for its expansion. The present structure was completed after its final expansion at the cost of $300,000. Frank L. Bodine submitted a proposal for the original but the one accepted came from Edward Lippincott Tilton, who also designed the rectangular annex in 1914. Charles Shilowitz designed major addition of the two wings that form a courtyard built between 1929 and 1933. In a Memorial Day fire in 1959 the central part of the interior and roof were badly burnt. After a $1.25 million restoration it re- opened to the public in 1963.

He was murdered by the German security forces and their collaborators in Operation Winterzauber, a punitive \\"bandit fighting\\" raid, together with his parishioners. Kashyra was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1999 together with the 108 Blessed Polish Martyrs . Early life Jury Kashyra was born in a village in the Russian Empire near Dzisna in a peasant Orthodox Belarusian family converted to Orthodoxy after the Unia, which they were derived had been banned. His mother found the faith of his ancestors in 1907. He spent his childhood in Vilnius. Kashyra was baptized in an Eastern Orthodox church, but in 1922, at the age of 18, he converted to Catholicism. Priestly career In 1924, Kashyra made his novitiate with the Marianists of the Immaculate Conception, congregation revived before the First World War by Blessed Jurgis Matulaitis-Matuleviƒçius (later Bishop of Vilnius), and congregation in which he completed his secondary education. He made his novitiate at Druya, a city border with Bolshevik Belarus where the congregation opened a school last year and there is a strong minority in Belarus. He took his vows in 1929 and was sent to study philosophy and theology in Rome at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. He continued his studies at the seminary of the Congregation which is at Vilnius, then was ordained a priest on June 20, 1935. He became a teacher at the high school in Druya and director of the Marianist juniorate. This year marks a change in the internal politics of Poland who knows an authoritarian regime marked by its distance from the Church and secularists who imposes laws on education. Priest Kashyra was sent in 1938 to Rasna in Polesia, but the worst happens when western Poland was invaded by the German Army in September 1939 and the provinces of eastern Poland by the Red Army at the end of the month. Marianists are evicted from their home Rasna at the beginning of 1940 by the Soviets who transform their property in a kolkhoz and Kashyra fled from house to house by Lithuania (who would turn down the Soviet side) to try to reach without success to Druya. He hides for months, until the Wehrmacht hunting the Soviet Lithuania. It can regain Druya in the summer of 1942, where Priest Eugene Kulesza was executed by the Soviets before their departure a year earlier. The town was occupied by the Germans since July 1941. There are still a few weeks until the blessed Anthony Leszczewicz, which restored life to the parish of Rossitsa further east on the other side of the Daugava River is called to work with him. Rossitsa is become Bolshevik side in 1918 and belonging to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Germans invaded in the summer of 1941 and the Marianists decided to settle there to do their pastoral mission of helping religious eucharistines. Over the months the Germans are becoming increasingly wary of Belarusian nationalism, which they suspect to support the Soviet Union. Martyrdom In February 1943, rumors indicated that a punitive operation (called Operation Winterzauber) will be conducted by Lithuanian and Latvian militia, supervised by the SS, to seek revenge against operations of Soviet partisans. Priest Leszczewicz decided to not abandon his flock and Priest Kashyra wished to remain too. They both sacrificed their lives, as stated in their correspondence. Militia enclosed on February 17 a thousand hostages in the church of Rositsa, where they were voluntarily joined by the two priests to give them spiritual and moral comfort and let them confess. Several hours passed. They managed to negotiate the release of some of the hostages by the German SS officer, but refused the proposal of the latter to let them out too. Finally, the militia and the Nazis locked the hostages in small groups in barns, in which they threw grenades and shot with rifles. Priest Leszczewicz was burned in the fire of a stable and Priest Kashyra burned in a barn a few hours later in the morning of February 18, 1943. Despite the danger, he remained until the very end with his parishioners in Rositsa, preparing them for the death. On February 18, 1943, he was burnt along with Fr. Anthony Leszczewicz and other people in Rositsa during the war. Beatification Jury Kashyra was beatified by Pope John Paul II on June 13, 1999 in Warsaw with a hundred other martyrs of the Second World War. Their memorial day is June 12.

The election was a rematch of the 1982 election, as incumbent Democratic Governor Mark White ran for reelection against former Republican Governor Bill Clements. Clements was elected to a second, non- consecutive term as governor, winning 53% of the vote to White's 46%. Primaries =Republican= =Democratic= Campaign =White= Incumbent Mark Wells White was inaugurated as Texas' 43rd Governor on January 18, 1983, having been elected to the governorship in the 1982 elections. He lost his re-election bid in 1986. He had been elected to statewide office as the 46th Texas Attorney General in 1978 and served in Governor Dolph Briscoe's administration as Texas Secretary of State, an appointed position, from 1973 until his resignation in 1977. Under White's administration, he focused his energies on education reform (including no pass/no play) and utility rate regulation. He also concentrated on economic development and the appointment of more minorities to positions on his staff and in the government. Texas' Sesquicentennial occurred in 1986, and the Governor attended and hosted a number of events. The Goddess of Liberty was restored and planning for Capitol restoration began during White's term in office. However, White's approval ratings began to slide downhill as a result of the enactment of \\"No Pass/NoPlay\\" in 1984, which made students ineligible for all extracurricular activities for six weeks if they fail to score at least 70 in any course during the previous six weeks. . Critics of the law including DeKalb Mayor Billy Eubanks said, \\"I have real mixed emotions about it\\", stating that the law had robbed his small town team of its shot at a district championship. \\"I hate to see those kids lose. It's kind of a losing situation when you're trying to teach team concepts, school spirit and all that. \\"Those kids that failed lost. Those kids that didn't fail, they lost, too, because they had to make up for some kids being out. The coaches lost. The community lost. Eubanks continued, \\"I don't object to the no-pass, no-play rule. I object to the extent and the punishment aspect of it. When you only have about 28 kids, total, playing football, that hurts.\\" In his 1985 State of the State address, White justified the controversial law by stating \\"well-educated minds are the oil and gas of this state's future.\\" Backed by big business, the first-term Democrat staked his hopes on reelection in 1986 on the belief that Texans, by and large, will support a new emphasis on academics over sports. He also pushed through the education reform package which took effect in 1985, and he launched a $500,000 statewide television ad campaign to promote the no-pass, no-play law. But as the football season reached its climax, growing numbers of angry high school coaches indicated in Dallas that they would support an unprecedented campaign to unseat White in the 1986 gubernatorial elections. =Clements= Bill Clements was elected to a second non-consecutive term as governor in 1986; having been elected in 1978 before losing reelection to White in 1982. Since losing in 1982, Clements made it pretty clear that he wanted to take back the governorship in 1986. University of Houston political science professor Richard Murray mentioned that the White-Clements rematch of 1986 like this: \\"Here you've got two guys who have been governor going at it. It should make for an interesting election.\\" In July 1985, Clements announced his candidacy to seek the governorship a third time. When asked why he wanted to avenge his 1982 loss, Clements said on the backlash against White's administration: \\"There's a strong negative feeling out there against the present administration that is even stronger than I had thought.\\" During the 1986 campaign, Clements and White staged the most expensive political race in state history, spending more than $25 million between them. The campaign was even more bitter and vicious than in 1982. He was endorsed by President Ronald Reagan, then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, U.S. Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), former U.S. Senator John Tower including former Democratic Governors Preston Smith and Price Daniel. The Clements campaign also found evidence to use against White such as the purchase of a state-owned Japanese jet, which heavily polled in Clements' favor. He, along with many Texans, blamed White for raising both the sales and incomes taxes, which the Legislature actually raised months before the election. Unemployment often exceeded 10%. Dallas and Houston led the nation in office vacancies, and corporate bankruptcies increasingly infected the business community. Among those involved in Clements' campaign included Karl Rove as his campaign manager and Reggie Bashur as his press secretary; he also began phoning his previous supporters, many of whom had already committed to other candidates, including Jim Francis; appointments secretary Tobin Armstrong; Bum Bright, an A&M; regent appointed by Clements; and pollster Lance Tarrance. =Debate= Although White started out trailing by double digits (30 points according to one polling firm), he turned the race into a very tight one. The two rival camps agreed to a televised debate, which occurred on October 6, 1986 in Houston, Texas. Reggie Bashur recalls that at the debate, the two candidates did not want to shake hands, but did so for the press: \\"And so they finally extended hands. Clements says, 'Well, Mark, your cartridge is dry', and White looked at Clements and said, 'Bill, you ready for business?.' Bashur also recalled that he said to Clements during the debate prep: \\"Why don't we get under White's skin? Let's get him off stride. When you get any kind of question about the budget, segue into that we've got to live within our means and cut waste.\\" I suggested that Clements say, \\"To cut waste, I'll sell the jet.\\" I suggested [we] itemize what is in the jet. You could say, \\"And I'll sell that $500 gold-plated ashtray, and I'll sell that $35,000 carpet, and I'll sell\\"-fifteen items. I wrote them all out. Clements takes that piece of paper and sticks it in his pocket, and that's the last I hear about it.\\" Bashur was pleased when this debate preparation paid a big dividend for Clements. The first question to Clements was about balancing the budget by cutting waste: \\"You could just see it click with Clements. He had a big smile on his face as he pulled the list out of the jacket, and he's got my piece of paper with the items. He doesn't just pick one or two; he reads all fifteen! White got beet red.

He ruled the city of Palembang, and raided the Strait of Malacca to plunder shipping and prey on both native and foreign merchants for several years. His fleet was defeated by the Ming dynasty Admiral Zheng He at the Battle of Palembang (1407). Chen was captured and sent to Chinese capital Nanjing for execution. Early career According to Ming records his name is first recorded after 1400, when a Ming convoy was attacked by pirates commanded by Chen Zuyi. At Palembang Chen had 5,000 men and 10 ships under his command, and was the strongest pirate of Southeast Asia at the time. The island of Sumatra had a diverse ethnicity of people from different parts of Asia, including a large minority of Han Chinese population (mostly male migrants, traders and merchants), and as well as the majority Sumatrans. A Hui Chinese, Shi Jinqing, reported the atrocities committed by the pirate chieftains, and requested assistance to help get rid of Chen Zuyi. However, forcing passing vessels to pay duties was an essential financial element of Southeast Asian state governance, and it has been suggested that Chen Zuyi was merely doing the same for his Palembang port city.  Defeat by Zheng He  In 1407, Chen was confronted at Palembang by the returning Ming treasure fleet under Admiral Zheng He. Zheng made the opening gambit, demanding Chen's surrender, and Chen quickly signalled agreement‚Äîwhile preparing for a surprise pre-emptive strike. But details of his plan were disclosed to Zheng by a local Chinese informant, and in the fierce battle that ensued, the superior Ming armada destroyed the pirate fleet and killed 5,000 of its men. Chen was captured and sent to Chinese capital Nanjing for public execution in 1407. Peace was restored to the Strait of Malacca as Shi Jinqing was installed as Palembang's new ruler and incorporated into what would become a far-flung system of allies who acknowledged Ming supremacy in return for diplomatic recognition, military protection, and trading rights. By the end of the Yongle reign, the kings or ambassadors of more than 30 foreign states had paid official visits to the emperor bearing tribute. They were ferried to China in luxurious staterooms on the Chinese treasure ships.  In popular culture  Chen Zuyi is portrayed by the actor Hou Xiangling in the 2009 Chinese television series Zheng He Xia Xiyang, which marked the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's voyages. Chen's defeat was considered the most famous of all Zheng He's military achievements.

The invention of tradition is a concept made prominent in the eponymous 1983 book edited by Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger. In the Introduction, Hobsbawm argues that many \\"traditions\\" which \\"appear or claim to be old are often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented.\\"Hobsbawm & Ranger (1983), p. 1. They distinguish the \\"invention\\" of traditions in this sense from \\"starting\\" or \\"initiating\\" a tradition which does not then claim to be old. The phenomenon is particularly clear in the modern development of the nation and of nationalism, creating a national identity promoting national unity, and legitimising certain institutions or cultural practices.The articles in the volume include Hugh Trevor-Roper's \\"The invention of tradition: the Highland tradition of Scotland,\\" Prys Morgan's \\"From a death to a view: the hunt for the Welsh past in the romantic period,\\" David Cannadine's \\"The context, performance and meaning of ritual: the British monarchy and the 'invention of tradition', c. 1820-1977,\\" Bernard S. Cohen's \\"Representing authority in Victorian India,\\" Terence Ranger's \\"The invention of tradition in colonial Africa,\\" and Eric Hobsbawm's \\"Mass-producing traditions: Europe, 1870-1914.\\" Application of the term and paradox The concept and the term have been widely applied to cultural phenomena such as the Bible and Zionism,Nur Masalha, The Bible and Zionism: Invented Traditions, Archaeology and Post-Colonialism in Palestine-Israel(London; New York: Zed Books 2007). , ) the martial arts of Japan,Stephen Vlastos, ed., Mirror of Modernity: Invented Traditions of Modern Japan (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.

The concept was influential on the use of related concepts, such as Benedict Anderson's imagined communities and the pizza effect.Anderson, Benedict. \\"The origins of national consciousness.\\" Nationalism: Critical Concepts in Political Science 1 (2000): 316, p. 37. One implication of the term is that the sharp distinction between \\"tradition\\" and \\"modernity\\" is often itself invented. The concept is \\"highly relevant to that comparatively recent historical innovation, the 'nation,' with its associated phenomena: nationalism, the nation-state, national symbols, histories, and the rest.\\" Hobsbawm and Ranger remark on the \\"curious but understandable paradox: modern nations and all their impedimenta generally claim to be the opposite of novel, namely rooted in remotest antiquity, and the opposite of constructed, namely human communities so 'natural' as to require no definition other than self-assertion.\\"Masuzawa (2005), p. 14. Another implication is that the concept of \\"authenticity\\" is also to be questioned. Criticism One reviewer (Peter Burke) noted that the \\"'invention of tradition' is a splendidly subversive phrase,\\" but it \\"hides serious ambiguities.\\" Hobsbawm \\"contrasts invented traditions with what he calls 'the strength and adaptability of genuine traditions.' But where does his 'adaptability', or his colleague Ranger's 'flexibility' end, and invention begin? Given that all traditions change, is it possible or useful to attempt to discriminate the 'genuine' antiques from the fakes?\\"Peter Burke, \\"Review\\", The English Historical Review 101.398 (1986): 316-317. Another also praised the high quality of the articles but had qualifications. \\"Such distinctions\\" (between invented and authentic traditions) \\"resolve themselves ultimately into one between the genuine and the spurious, a distinction that may be untenable because all traditions (like all symbolic phenomena) are humanly created (\\"spurious\\") rather than naturally given (\\"genuine\\").\\"Richard Handler, \\"Review\\", American Anthropologist 86.4 (1984): 1025-1026. Pointing out that \\"invention entails assemblage, supplementation, and rearrangement of cultural practices so that in effect traditions can be preserved, invented, and reconstructed\\", Guy Beiner proposed that a more accurate term would be ‚Äúreinvention of tradition‚Äù, signifying \\"a creative process involving renewal, reinterpretation and revision\\".

She quietly found a new home for the school and received permission from the parents of her pupils, most of whom were Jewish, to bring them to safety in England. The new school was called New Herrlingen School, but came to be known as Bunce Court. The school closed in 1948.

Landschulheim Herrlingen opened on 1 May 1926 as a private boarding school with 18 children ranging in age from 6 to 12.

The children learned two languages from the first day of school on, with emphasis on the spoken, rather than the written word. Learning was accomplished through living, whether from daily walks in the woods, from the tasks required of the children in and around the building, or at meal time, where there were \\"English\\" and \\"French\\" tables and those sitting at them would speak in those languages during the meal.

In May 1933, Essinger was informed that her oldest pupils would not be allowed to take the tests for the abitur, the school-leaving certificate needed to pursue a university education, and most non-Jewish parents withdrew their children from the school.

In autumn 1933, three different groups of children and staff set out on an educational trip for the Netherlands, leaving from the south, the north and the east of Germany.

English people were unaware of what was taking place in Germany and did not understand why Essinger and the school had left Germany. The new school was makeshift and finances meagre, causing the English education inspectors to be initially unfavourable toward New Herrlingen. Within a year or two, however, enough improvements had been made that they came to realize the school was viable and unique. In October 1937, there were 68 pupils enrolled at Bunce Court, 41 were boys and 27 were girls. Of the 68, all but three were boarders and all but 12 were foreign-born. By this time, the school had won the respect of the authorities. After three days spent visiting Bunce Court in 1937, inspectors from the British government's Ministry of Education reported their amazement \\"at what could be achieved in teaching with limited facilities\\" and that they were \\"convinced it was the personality, enthusiasm and interest of teachers rather than their teaching 'apparatus' that made the school work competently\\".

Retrieved 29 September 2011 = Finances = Fees were set at ¬£100 a year and many, because of their situations, could not pay, or were there on a promise that funds would be forthcoming. The number of pupils was constantly in flux, whether from having finished and passed the Cambridge school examination or because of the chaotic conditions of the era. At times, there were well over 100 pupils, but at other times, well under 100. The school made ends meet by putting everyone‚Äîchildren and staff‚Äîto work tending the gardens and animals, and maintaining the buildings and grounds. When a school inspector asked a boy if he'd also done such manual labour back in Germany, he answered, \\"There, it was an educational method; here, it is a necessity.\\" The children grasped the situation and pitched in. = Education = Classes were small, from five to eight pupils. The curriculum focused on the English language and literature, history, and maths. German literature was also taught so that the children would understand that \\"despite all that had happened, human values had not changed and that it was worth nurturing the cultural foundations of the children even though they were separated from their homeland.\\"Hildegard Feidel-Mertz, translated by Andrea Hammel, \\"Integration and Formation of Identity: Exile Schools in Great Britain\\" in: Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies, University of Nebraska Press (Fall 2004). Volume 23, Number 1, pp. 71‚Äì84 There was no money for a laboratory, so the sciences were minimal. Alumnus Thomas Mayer said Bunce Court provided \\"a highly intellectual atmosphere\\" with pupils who were excited about what they were learning, where their \\"intellectual interests were not confined to classroom learning, but encompassed politics, literature and art.\\"Roger E. Backhouse, Roger Middleton (eds.) Exemplary Economists: North America Edward Elgar Publishing Limited. Vol. 1 (2000), pp. 96‚Äì97. Retrieved 19 October 2011) The official language of the school was English. New teachers from England were told not to learn German for at least a year. Essinger also accepted English children to the school, especially non-Jews to foster the non-denominational aspect, and bring in some financial and linguistic support, as well. Nonetheless, most German staff and pupils reverted to German or a combination of German and English, so most English teachers and pupils learned German. Religion was not stressed at the school, but was just part of the curriculum. Many alumni were, in their adult lives, agnostic or irreligious. Nonetheless, those who wished to observe traditional Friday evening observances and holidays were able to do so with similarly interested staff.Hanna Bergas (1979), p. 11 Most Bunce Court pupils were from families that had assimilated into the local culture and the children knew little about Jewish culture. Nazi persecution and discrimination made them aware of their Jewishness, so that in England, the school added courses on Jewish history, the teachings of Jewish prophets and the ideas of Jewish philosophers like Maimonides and Spinoza. These courses were taught by Hanna Bergas.Hanna Bergas (1979), pp. 23‚Äì24 In 1939, war broke out in Europe and on 3 September 1939, war was declared between England and Germany. Defence Regulation 18b was issued, ordering the internment of anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Nazis. The Home Office then ruled that anyone born in Germany was classified as an enemy alien and all German males over age 16 were interned. In addition to the pupils who were interned, some of the pupils who had gone home that summer to visit their families in Nazi areas never returned and were not heard from again.Richard W. Sonnenfeldt, Witness to Nuremberg p. 134.

This benefited the school greatly. Maths was taught by an astronomer, the music teacher had been an assistant to Ludwig Karl Koch, the stoker, formerly a senior producer at Berlin's Deutsches Theater, directed school plays. = Special needs = After Kristallnacht, the United Kingdom agreed to accept 10,000 German children in Kindertransports and Bunce Court took in as many of the refugees as possible. As Hitler invaded and annexed other countries, children began to come from Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. With an enrolment of uprooted children whose parents were in unknown circumstances, coming from different social classes and cultures,Richard W. Sonnenfeldt, Witness to Nuremberg Arcade Publishing, Inc. (2006), p. 124\\\\. Retrieved 29 September 2011 Essinger sometimes found it difficult to find British teachers who were up to the challenges and needs of the pupils. Some children were \\"almost ill with homesickness and the older children anxious for parents, brothers and sisters left in Germany. A Quaker worker told...of parents' agony of mind who could only choose one of several children to go to England for safe education and which to select‚Äîthe most brilliant, most fit, or one most vulnerable and unlikely to survive?\\" Ultimately, many of the pupils never saw their parents again. Years later, teacher Hans Meyer said, \\"At the time, it was less important to be a good teacher than it was to be an sympathetic human being. It was more important to give them a good-night kiss than [to teach] excellent German literature.\\" In some cases, there would be letters from parents and then they'd stop coming, particularly once war broke out.Michael Trede, Der R√ºckkehrer (2003), p. 64 Meyer said, \\"We tried to lead them away from the period of silence. We didn't know what had happened to the parents. We couldn't give them any hope, neither could we take it from them.\\" The teachers also had special needs. Upon arriving in England, the overriding concern was to make a good home for the children. At the end of the first year, the teachers had been available to the children without any time off or uninterrupted privacy for themselves. While they were elated that things were going so well, they were exhausted. That changed with the establishment of \\"off-duty\\" time to refresh oneself. \\"It became possible to read, to write a letter, to go away for a few hours or a weekend without being interrupted or missed\\" wrote Hanna Bergas. She noted that the return to the community was always a joy.Hanna Bergas (1979), p. 27 = Evacuation to Trench Hall = In June 1940, the school, with roughly 140 children, was given just three days' notice (extended to a week) to evacuateMichael Trede, Der R√ºckkehrer (2003), pp. 87‚Äì89 when the area was determined to be too near the Battle of Britain to tolerate an entire school full of \\"enemy aliens\\", who were viewed as potential collaborators.Hanna Bergas (1979), pp. 50‚Äì51 Essinger found a new location several hours away at Trench Hall, near Wem in Shropshire. After \\"packing feverishly\\", the school moved on 14 June 1940, shortly before the senior pupils would have to take their matriculation exams. They all passed. Unlike the original trip to Bunce Court, when the children had shown great interest in the surroundings, this time, tired from the packing, bewildered and restless, they took little interest in the scenery for the first several hours. Then the buses passed through the already bombed city of Coventry, later to be devastated by the Coventry Blitz. The children were shaken, having been previously removed from the reality of war. It was smaller than Bunce Court, so a group of the youngest children were sent temporarily to a school in Surrey.Hanna Bergas (1979), p. 52 Even so, there was terrible overcrowding and after a year, the chicken coop and the stables were converted into dormitories, creating enough room to allow the younger children to return. Even so, some bedrooms doubled as classrooms and had to be rearranged for use every morning.Hanna Bergas (1979), p. 60 More time-consuming, however, was having to cover every window in the evening to comply with the orders for a complete blackout, a task which had to be carried out for years.Hanna Bergas (1979), p. 61 In this new location, the local residents occasionally hurled epithets at the pupils, calling them \\"dirty Jerries\\". When the 1944 film Henry V was showing at the local cinema, Essinger did not let Bunce Courtians go, in part because she'd been warned that the first newsreel reports from Bergen- Belsen concentration camp would be shown and she didn't want her pupils to realize why they had not heard from their parents, but she was also worried that harm would come to them at the hands of some of the locals. The school remained at Trench Hall until 1946. The property was much too small for the 140 pupils who moved there, but enrolment dropped after the Nazis banned Jewish emigration in 1941. Also, the school could no longer keep its chickens, pigs or bee hives. While the school was evacuated at Trench Hall, the buildings and grounds of Bunce Court were used by the military and were much changed and required restoration work before the school could return.Hanna Bergas (1979), p. 65 Not until after the war was over, was the school finally able to return to Bunce Court in 1946. = Final years = The last children to come to Bunce Court were orphaned Nazi concentration camp survivors who no longer knew what normal life was like. One such boy was Sidney Finkel, born Sevek Finkelstein in Poland, who survived the Piotrkow ghetto, deportation to a slave labour camp, separation from his family and imprisonment at Czestochowa, Buchenwald and Theresienstadt concentration camps. He arrived in England in August 1945 at the age of 14 and, along with 10 other Polish boys, was sent to Bunce Court. Traumatized, he and the others were treated with love and care.

Her work involves sculpture using carved, assembled and highly painted wood with gold and silver leaf and encaustic. The wood, the paint and the layers that make up the sculpture record a journey of memory, images and ideas. Azara's other art pieces involve collages, banners, prints where she continuously reshapes the elements and materials. Azara has worked and carved in wood for many years because of the presence and symbolism inherent in trees and because the metaphor of the tree is a ‚Äústand-in‚Äù for herself. This statement and representation of tree as ‚Äúself‚Äù and woman is timely in a world which is losing touch with its primal essence. Life and career Nancy J. Azara was born in the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn, New York. She is a graduate of Finch College, NY; Empire State College, SUNY and also studied at the Art Students League of New York and at the Lester Polakoff Studio of Stage Design. After graduating from Finch, she became a costume designer for the theatre. Known for her artwork that encompasses feminism, healing and individual connection to the divine, she developed her political views and signature style as a part of the 1970s feminist art movement in the United States. She was included in the feminist publication HeresiesHeresies and most recently in the Woman's Art Journal In 1979, Azara co-founded a feminist art school, the New York Feminist Art Institute in 1979‚Äì1990 with Miriam Schapiro, Carol Stronghilos, Irene Peslikis, Lucille Lessane and Selena Whitefeather. NYFAI's mission was to examine issues relating to gender, self, and identity through a non-traditional curriculum. Within the context of group sessions, students concentrated on developing a better understanding of themselves and their position as women before embarking on the study of artistic technique. The chronic shortage of funding ultimately forced NYFAI to close in 1990, although some of its innovative art programs continue in other venues.

When I did find women‚Äôs art in exhibits, it was a single artist‚Äôs work here and there, usually tucked in among the men‚Äôs work. It‚Äôs been a long struggle, but a heartening one to come to, to find so many women artists working, and showing, speaking in their art about their visions, their lives, translating into color and form their unique voices‚Äîmaking public their presence. We may not so easily realize it now, but considering millenniums of lack of recognition and rejection, making and showing art is a courageous act for women.‚Äù Nancy Azara, Re-Visioning catalogue, Maitland Art Center, Florida, July 2005. Her works following the feminist agenda making sculptures, carving pieces of wood that are logs or milled lumber, ranging in size from 1 foot to 12 feet or more. The work is often gilded with metal leaf, painted with tempera, encaustic, and oils, stained and sometimes burned or bleached. These formal properties are the psychic outer layer. Within the psychic inner layer is the voice of my heart and what resides within it. Azara discusses the meaning of her artworks, which is about the nature of memory, yearning and desire. \\"All my work is about the brilliance of light, about the shadows and the darkness, about a history of what was, about the nature of memory, yearning, and desire\\" Azara, Nancy. \\"Orange Branch with Gold / Tree Altar / Circle with Seven Hands / Great Coat.\\" Frontiers, vol. 21, no. 3, 2000 The Orange Branch with Goldby Nancy Azara 32\\" x 20\\" x 12\\" was carved, painted wood with gold leaf Orange Branch with Gold is a homage to the unique nature of the tree, its treeness celebrated in its bright startling hot orange light presence.

He was born in Malima in Panjshir province. He is considered to be Afghanistan‚Äôs most famous modern poet who has practiced both \\"New\\" and \\"Classic\\" poetry styles. Asi died in Kabul when a rocket hit his home during the 1990s civil war. Like many other Afghan poets and writers of his time, Asi showed his concerns about the political and social situation of Afghanistan. His poetry is, sometimes, strongly influenced by the then socio-political developments in Afghanistan. His explicit expression of the situations caused him personal problems with the then regimes in Kabul. His book Az Jazeera e Khoon() (from the Blood Island) is a good example where he expresses his concerns about the situation of his country during the rule of the Mujaheedin and the civil war. Asi promised to publish a poetry book each year and was successful in keeping his promise. He also wrote many poems with romantic and emotional contents and worked with Afghan singer Farhad Darya. Personal life Asi was born in the small village of Malima in the now Panjshir Province. He studied agriculture at Kabul University. Asi was married to Meetra and had a daughter named Mahasti. Like many other Afghans of his time, Asi had to flee to one of the neighboring countries to save himself and his family from the destruction of the civil war. He chose Iran and arrived there in the spring of 1994. In his short stay in Mashhad, Asi worked intensively with Afghan Poets and published a book and many articles. He then had to go back to Afghanistan after being denied a residence permit in Iran. Shortly after returning to Kabul, he was killed by a rocket which hit his home.

Powers (born Harm Drenth; November 17, 1893 ‚Äì March 18, 1932) was a Dutch-born American serial killer who was hanged in Moundsville, West Virginia. Powers lured his victims through \\"Lonely Hearts\\" ads, claiming he was looking for love, but ultimately murdering them for their money. Davis Grubb's 1953 novel The Night of the Hunter and its 1955 film adaptation were based on these crimes.http://www.skcentral.com/news.php?readmore=2258 Jayne Anne Phillips's novel Quiet Dell (2013) examined the Powers case anew. Early life Harm Drenth was born in 1893 in Beerta, in the Netherlands. He immigrated to the United States in 1910 and lived in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. His family came in 1911 to the US. Harm moved to West Virginia in 1926. In 1927, he married Luella Strother, an owner of a farm and grocery store, after responding to her lonely hearts ad. Though now married, Powers took out his own lonely hearts ads. Many women wrote in response to his advertisement. \\"Postal records later indicated that replies to Powers' advertisement poured in at a rate of 10 to 20 letters per day.\\" Powers constructed a garage and basement at his home in Quiet Dell; the garage was later discovered to be the scene of the murders, of which he was convicted. After his 1931 arrest, police investigation using fingerprints and photographs revealed that he had been incarcerated for burglary under his birth name in Barron County, Wisconsin in 1921‚Äì1922. Although not charged, Powers was suspected of involvement in the 1928 disappearance of Dudley C. Wade, a carpet sweeper salesman with whom he had once worked, and the unsolved murder of a Jane Doe in Morris, Illinois.WC Culture Murders Using the alias \\"Cornelius Orvin Pierson,\\" Powers began writing letters to Asta Eicher, a widowed mother of three residing in Park Ridge, Illinois. Powers went to visit Eicher and her children‚ÄîGreta, Harry, and Annabel‚Äîon June 23, 1931, and soon left with Eicher for several days. Elizabeth Abernathy cared for the children until she received a letter saying that \\"Pierson\\" was going to come pick up the children to join him and their mother. When he arrived, he sent a child to the bank to withdraw money from Eicher's account. The child returned empty-handed because the signature on the check was forged. Powers and the children then hastily departed. He told neighbors concerned about their disappearance that they were on a trip to Europe.\\"This day in West Virginia History, March 18.\\" Jackson Newspapers March 18, 2011.

Some time later, Powers courted Dorothy Pressler Lemke from Northborough, Massachusetts, who was also looking for love through lonely hearts ads. He brought her to Iowa to marry her and persuaded her to withdraw $4,000 from her bank account. Lemke did not notice that instead of sending her trunks to Iowa, where Powers claimed to be living, he sent them to the address of \\"Cornelius O. Pierson\\" of Fairmont, West Virginia. Asta Eicher, her children, and Dorothy Lemke had disappeared with no explanation.\\"WOMEN: We Make Thousands Happy.\\" Time Magazine. September 14, 1931. Sep. 27, 2011.

In August 1931, police began investigating the disappearances of Asta Eicher and her children, beginning with \\"Pierson\\", who was discovered emptying Eicher's house. They found love letters, which led them to Quiet Dell, where \\"Pierson\\" lived under the name Harry Powers with his wife. Powers was arrested and his house in Quiet Dell was searched. Police found the crime scene in four rooms located under Pierson's garage. Bloody clothing, hair, a burned bankbook and a small bloody footprint of a child were discovered. Citizens of the town began to arrive at the scene to watch the unraveling of the crimes Powers had committed. Police began to dig up a freshly filled-in ditch found on Powers' property, and the bodies of Asta Eicher, her children and Dorothy Lemke were uncovered. Evidence and autopsy results showed that the two girls and their mother were strangled to death while the young boy's head was beaten in with a hammer. Lemke was uncovered with a belt wrapped around her neck, with which she was strangled. Love letters were found in the trunk of Powers' automobile. He had written back to many women with the intention of stealing their money and killing them, just as with his most recent victims. Trial and execution On September 20, 1931, a lynch mob attempting to take Powers from the jail was dispersed with fire hoses and tear gas. Powers was then moved to the West Virginia State Penitentiary in Moundsville. Powers' five-day trial was held at a local opera house because of the large number of spectators. Numerous witnesses testified to the evidence in Powers' home, that he had been with the victims and picked up their luggage, and so on; Powers also testified for himself.

The novel is a third-person narrative that follows the protagonist, Benny Imura. Upon release, the book was generally well-received and received a majority of positive reviews.  Synopsis  = Setting = Fourteen years after the zombie outbreak, most living humans are spread out in small settlements just barely getting by. The communities rely on traders who pass through and the sparse gardens that a few people cultivate. Rot & Ruin plays out in a settlement called Mountainside, located in the Sierra Nevada mountains. and in the land outside of the fence, the Rot and Ruin. The Rot and Ruin is the dangerous land where zombies live. Most people are of the firm opinion that nothing of the old world exists beyond their enclave, and a sense of fatalistic survival pervades in the mind of most people who survived 'first night', the original zombie outbreak. Some of the younger generation are not ready to accept that as the only answer. = Plot summary = Following the zombie apocalypse, most people live in towns behind chain link fence, have surrendered most of the world, commonly referred to as 'the Rot & Ruin' to the undead. Having reached the age of 15 and no longer considered children, Benny Imura and his friend Louis Chong look for jobs. Benny resists the obvious option of apprenticing with his older, estranged brother Tom as zombie hunter (or as Tom refers to it, 'closure specialist'). Chong becomes a spotter for the local watch, but Benny finds no good fit and is still left without a job as his rations are about to be cut. Out of options, he finally asks Tom if he can be his apprentice. Tom accepts and the next morning they set out into the Rot and Ruin. Travelling beyond the fence for the first time, Benny realizes that zombies are not monsters; they are victims and should be respected. Tom reveals to him the immorality of the hunters who maim the zombies to hunt them for sport, and how he differs from them, 'quieting' zombies at the behest of loved ones instead of bringing in zombie corpses for a bounty. Benny and Tom go to an gated but abandoned suburban community known as Sunset Hollow, where Benny, Tom, and their family lived before the zombie outbreak. When they arrive at their former home, Tom explains that he has kept their infected parents trapped inside until Benny was old enough to help him 'quiet' their parents, giving them final peace. Tom needed Benny to be old enough to realize what Tom did wasn't just hunting the undead, but giving the infected and their loved ones closure, hence his reticence to destroy zombies randomly. Benny realizes that Tom was not a coward - he also comes to the realization that Tom rescued him from their infected parents the night of the outbreak. The brothers, reconciled in understanding and grief, collapse to the floor in tears, holding on to each other as they do.Maberry, Jonathan. Rot & Ruin. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2010. 458. Print. Zombie Hunters have become a culture of celebrity and hero worship, including having trading cards made of them that are popular collectibles. A 'zombie card' of a nearly mythological girl known as 'The Lost Girl' piques Benny's interest. The card's artist, Rob Sacchetto, tells him more about the Lost Girl, who, despite being a small teenage girl, is reputed to have survived the Rot and Ruin on her own for years. Zombie Hunters Charlie Pink-eye and The Motor City Hammer stop Benny on his way home and demand he hand over the Lost Girl card. They threaten Benny, which reveals their true, violent evil nature to him, where he had admired both men previously. Tom arrives just in time to rescue Benny and escorts him home. The incident sparks Benny's curiosity, and he, his friend Chong, as well as friends Morgie and romantic interest 'Nix' (short for Phoenix) Riley end up searching for The Lost Girl, but instead stumble across a horror called 'Gameland', where kidnapped children are forced to fight zombies for the entertainment of the crowd. Charlie Pink Eye and the Motor City Hammer have run the evil fighting pits for years, much to Tom's frustration. The Lost Girl turns out to be real, a young woman named Lilah who has experienced deep traumas living in the Rot and Ruin and as a result, has gone almost feral. She, the teens from town, and Tom combine forces to defeat Charlie, the Hammer and end Gameland forever. On their trip home, Benny and Nix see a jumbo jet fly overhead, turn around, and fly away. They decide to pursue the jet and see where it came from.  Awards  Rot & Ruin won the 2011 Eva Perry Mock Printz medal.Perry, Eva. Eva Perry Mock Printz Book Club. 2011. Web. 28 Sep. 2011. .

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  390 East Center Street  The Knight‚ÄìAllen home was constructed in 1888 in the Victorian style. Containing a Moorish tin scalloped roof, an Italianate turret, distinctive lintels, Romanesque porch tiers, and several ornate window shapes, it is an excellent example of a Victorian Eclectic home. The Knight‚ÄìAllen House was designated to the Provo City Historic Landmarks Registry on June 19, 1996. = Jessie Knight = Perhaps the wealthiest man in Provo at the time, Jesse Knight was born in 1845 in Nauvoo, Illinois. Jessie's family migrated west, and reached Utah Territory in 1857. Twelve years later Jessie married Amanda McEwan, and began a ranch near Payson. Following an impression that he had, Jessie began a mining operation in the Eureka area and became rich. He subsequently bought other mines, founded a bank, purchased real estate in Provo, bought the Provo Woolen Mills, and started farming and cattle interests in Canada. Throughout all of these efforts Jessie remained an active supporter of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and his mines were called the \\"cleanest mining camps in the west (Utah State Historical Society p. 2).\\" Jessie Knight died in 1921, designating much of his amassed fortune to Brigham Young University and various other institutions. After his death, the house was occupied by Jessie's daughter, Inez Knight Allen, and her husband. = The Victorian Mansions of Provo = Built between the years 1893 and 1908 in Provo, Utah, this group of Victorian mansions are historically significant and represent not only fine architecture but some of the most successful men of the city and state at the time. These mansions include the Charles E. Loose House, the William H. Ray House, the Knight‚ÄìAllen House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, the Knight-Mangum House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. All of these homes derive from the high style: Eastlake, Shingle, Craftsman, Italianate, Classical, Moorish, Colonial, and Romanesque Revivals. Made primarily of brick, these homes exhibit the finest architecture and most ornate detailing to be found in the city of Provo. = Jesse Knight and the Tintic mining industry = The successful commercial mining of precious metals and minerals transformed Utah's economy from basically an agrarian base to a more industrialized state. Within this development the Tintic Mining District, located approximately thirty miles southwest of Provo, was founded in 1869 and by 1899 became the leading mining center in Utah with a value of output placed at $5 million. A central figure in Tintic success was Jesse Knight and the Knight family who resided in Provo. Jesse Knight attained wealth with his Humbug mine in the mid-1890s. The large silver producer allowed Knight to develop other mines in the East Tintic area. Knightsville grew around the workings and became touted as the only saloon-free, prostitute-free, privately owned mining camp in the U.S. His strict adherence to doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints made the town one inhabited primarily by members of that church. Jessie Knight was able to expand farther than the Tintic mines, reaching to the power plant in Santaquin, the Tintic drain tunnel project, the Knight Dry farm, and the smelters at Silver City. The Bonneville Mining company, the Knight Woolen Mills, Ellison Ranching Company, The American-Columbian Corporation, The Springville-Mapleton Sugar Company, The Spring Canyon Coal Company, Utah Savings Bank, The Layton Sugar Company, and the Tintic Drain Tunnel Company all represent facets of the Knight Investment Company. As a result of all these financial successes, the Knight-Allen house was able to be built. It was probably designed by Provo architect Richard C. Watkins. =Preservation= The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 as part of a multiple property submission that nominated seven and listed six Provo houses. The listed houses are the Knight‚ÄìMangum House, the John R. Twelves House, the Jesse Knight House, this, the Knight‚ÄìAllen House, the William H. Ray House, and the Thomas N. Taylor House. The seventh, the Charles E.

The Columbia Guide to American Indians of the Southwest. New York:Columbia University Press. p. 130. . This period occurred at the end of the Ice Age, when there was significant glacial run-off so that much of the land was covered by lakes and savannas. As this period of time ended, the land dried up into desert, and people had to adapt. The changes resulted in the Archaic period, when people became hunters of smaller mammals and gatherers. =Archaic period= People of the Archaic period (5850-3050 BC) were hunters of smaller game, such as deer, antelope and rabbits, and gatherers of wild plants. The people moved seasonally to hunting and gathering sites. Late in the Archaic period, about 200-500 AD, corn was introduced into the diet and the making of pottery for storing food became an occupation.Kipfer, Barbara Ann. (2000). Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology. New York:Plenum Publisher. p.341. . Archaic people built structures with stone walls. The Roxborough residents accessed two quarries within Roxborough's Hogback region to create tools in the early Archaic period through later periods. There were a number of quarries found within Roxborough that, depending upon the site, contained jasper, opal, petrified wood and quartzite.Nelson, Sarah M. (2008). Denver: An Archaeological History. Boulder, CO: University Press of Colorado. pp. 37, 74, 81. . =Woodland period= The groups of people during the Woodland period (500-1000 AD) became much more diverse, were more likely to settle in a location or a couple of locations, cultivate, domesticate animals, make pottery and baskets, and perform ceremonial rituals.Waldman, Carl.

The majority of artifacts, though, were from the late Archaic and Woodland periods. While at Roxborough, people lived in protected areas near water. Based upon their use of south and western facing shelters, it is conjectured that they wintered in the area. Ancient people who lived or traveled through the land were ancestors to Apache, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche and Ute tribes. Utes used the Stagecoach area for summer hunting grounds and passed through the area to their northern grounds. Their trails became County Roads 14 and 18.

Legal context Baronies were created after the Norman invasion of Ireland as divisions of counties and were used the administration of justice and the raising of revenue. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier Gaelic t√∫ath which had submitted to the Crown.  Location  The barony formed the medieval heart of the city but must be distinguished from the similar-sounding Barony of Cork which is a separate entity that surrounds the Barony of Cork City. The present city of Cork takes in both baronies. The estuary of the River Lee at its confluence with the River Glashaboy at Glanmire forms the boundary with the Barony of Barrymore. North of the Lee, a single civil parish - Rathcooney - in the Barony of Cork, separates the barony from that of Barrymore. At all other points, the Barony of Cork envelopes the Barony of Cork City.

The establishment of the corps was largely instigated by Colonel Fitzstephen French, of Frenchpark, County Roscommon, an MP for that county. Proponents of the force saw it as a way of uniting Irishmen of differing religious and political backgrounds in the common defence of their country. French attempted, but failed, to introduce a bill, the Volunteer Corps (Ireland) Bill, which would legitimise the setting up of a Volunteer Corps in the country. The following year the organisation was renamed the Loyal Association for Irish Rifle Volunteers. Background On 12 May 1859 the Secretary of State for War, Jonathan Peel had issued a circular letter to lieutenants of counties in England, Wales and Scotland, authorising the formation of volunteer rifle corps (VRC, a.k.a. corps of rifle volunteers and rifle volunteer corps), and of artillery corps in defended coastal towns.War Office Circular, 12 May 1859, published in The Times, 13 May. Volunteer corps were to be raised under the provisions of the Volunteer Act 1804 (44 Geo.3 c.54) However, despite the intercession of some Irish MPs, Ireland was omitted from this project. A Volunteer Corps manned and officered in the main by Irishmen, the Irish Rifle Volunteer Corps had been set up in London in 1859. Aftermath To replace the 1804 legislation, the Volunteer Act 1863 (26 & 27 Vict. C.65) was passed,Volunteer Act 1863 (26 & 27 Vict. C.65) which still omitted Ireland from the right to have its own Volunteer Force, which sounded the death-knell of an Irish Volunteer Corps. In June 1879 the Chevalier O'Clery, MP for County Wexford, introduced a bill, the Irish Volunteer Bill, in the British Parliament, which had the intention of allowing an armed Volunteer Corps to be set up in the country. The leaders of the Irish Party were divided on the issue, and only a small number supported it. The Chief Secretary for Ireland opposed the bill. The bill was rejected in Parliament on 1 March 1880.

Headquartered in Manhattan, New York, they function in countries throughout the world.  History  The Center was founded in 1994 with the stated mission of \\"discover(ing) and develop(ing) new voices for the American theater.\\" John Clinton Eisner, a founding member, continues to serve as the organization's leader. Originally, the company presented plays in full production at various New York venues such as Theatre Row and Manhattan Class Company, but it soon located itself at Chelsea Playhouse, sharing space with three other non- profits. Recently, they moved into their own space at 311 West 43rd Street in Manhattan. Initially, the Lark Play Development Center produced plays that were classical as well as original, including Shakespeare, and sent Theater for Young Audiences tours to nearby schools. In 1997, John Clinton Eisner reassessed the Lark Play Development Center's methods and practices for supporting new plays making several changes that would significantly alter the company‚Äôs operations, transforming the organization. Today, the company no longer produces classic works or tours in schools, focusing instead on supporting playwrights as they develop their works. In 2020, Stacy Waring was named Executive Director of The Lark. https://www.larktheatre.org/blog/spotlight-stacy-waring-larks-new-executive- director/  Achievements  The Center has received a variety of recognition.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The Knight Block was constructed in 1900, and served as Jesse Knight‚Äôs financial headquarters. It was designated to the National Register of Historic Places in May 1977. = Structure = A three story building, the Knight Block is a rectangular structure containing a ground floor for retail, a basement, and two upper floors used for offices. The structure is made of red brick with gray limestone lintels. On the Southwest of the building is a clock tower which rises over the roof line of the building. Several additions have been made to the building, such as three bays built on the north end of the western face of the building and the inside of the main floor. = Jessie Knight = Perhaps the wealthiest man in Provo at the time, Jesse Knight was born in 1845 in Nauvoo, Illinois. Jessie‚Äôs family migrated west, and reached Utah in 1857. Twelve years later, Jessie married a woman by the name of Amanda McEwan, and began a ranch in Payson, Utah. Following an impression that he had, Jessie began a mining operation in the Eureka area and became rich. He subsequently bought other mines, founded a bank, purchased real estate in Provo, bought the Provo Woolen Mills, and started farming and cattle interests in Canada. Throughout all of these efforts Jessie remained an active supporter of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and his mines were called the ‚Äúcleanest mining camps in the west (Utah State Historical Society p. 2).‚Äù Jessie Knight died in 1921, designating much of his amassed fortune to BYU and various other institutions. =Jesse Knight and The Tintic Mining Industry= The successful commercial mining of precious metals and minerals transformed Utah's economy from basically an agrarian base to a more industrialized state. Within this development the Tintic Mining District, located approximately thirty miles southwest of Provo, was founded in 1869 and by 1899 became the leading mining center in Utah with a value of output placed at five million dollars. A central figure in Tintic success was Jesse Knight and the Knight family who resided in Provo. Jesse Knight attained wealth with his Humbug mine in the mid-1890s. The large silver producer allowed Knight to develop other mines in the East Tintic area. Knightsville grew around the workings and became touted as the only saloon-free, prostitute-free, privately owned mining camp in the U.S. His strict adherence to doctrines of the LDS Church made the town one inhabited primarily by Mormons. Jessie Knight was able to expand farther than the tintic mines, reaching to the power plant in Santaquin, the Tintic drain tunnel project, the Knight Dry farm, and the smelters at Silver City. The Bonneville Mining company, the Knight Woolen Mills, Ellison Ranching Company, The American-Columbian Corporation, The Springville-Mapleton Sugar Company, The Spring Canyon Coal Company, Utah Savings Bank, The Layton Sugar Company, and the Tintic Drain Tunnel Company all represent facets of the Knight Investment Company. The fortune Jesse Knight earned from these investments allowed the construction of not only the Knight Block, but also the Knight-Mangum House, the Knight-Allen House, and the Jesse Knight House. and See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Utah County, Utah References External links * NRHP Listings in Provo Utah Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Provo, Utah Category:Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Utah Category:Historic district contributing properties in Utah ","title":"Knight Block"},{"id":"33244723","text":"Reksteren is an island in the municipality of Tysnes in Vestland county, Norway.

Unreliable rainfall and a lack of glacial lakes in the area necessitate the use of a tower to pump and store water from an underground reservoir. History The Pipestone Water Tower is unique in that it is one of only two water towers in the United States known to have been designed by architect L.P. Wolfe; its sister, the Brainerd Water Tower, is located in Brainerd, Minnesota. It was built to replace an aged steel standpipe tower built in the late 1880s. Construction on the structure was commenced by the Campbell Construction Company in 1920 for $24,610. Water service from the tower began on October 26, 1921 and continued until it was replaced by a larger tower in 1976. A restoration of the tower was undertaken in 1990, along with the construction of a new wayside rest area. Structure The water tower, significant in that it is constructed of poured concrete, stands at tall and roughly in diameter. The capacity tank is supported by a hollow supporting column which contains an unusual set of spiral windows and an internal staircase. The tower pumped and stored water from a reservoir built below it at the time of its construction, releasing the water via gravity on demand. Present day The tower has become the center of the Water Tower Festival, a community celebration held in late June.

Originally serving as a creamery, it eventually became a hub for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and an important symbol of their faith. This structure is only one story high, and is made of brick. It has a roof that is a mix between a gable roof and a hip roof, and possesses a stone foundation and a false front. The detailing of the home includes corbelling of the upper edge, rock-faced shoulder arches, and jigsaw cut elements in the wooden arches. There have been no major changes to the building, and it remains in good condition. The Lakeview Tithing office is one of twenty eight tithing offices in Utah for the LDS Church, which buildings functioned between 1850 and 1910. These facilities served for church members to be able to collect, store, and distribute the farm products donated as tithing, for at the time, agricultural products comprised most of what people worked for and earned. Serving as a node for economic activity and welfare, the Lakeview tithing office was a vital building for many of the early inhabitants of the city who belonged to the LDS church. History Built in 1899 by Leslie L. Bunnell, the Lakeview Tithing office, prior to being a tithing office, operated as a creamery for several years. The first creamery in Lakeview, this building was involved in the producing and selling of cheese and butter, and the selling of milk. The Bunnell family, consisting of five children, lived inside the creamery on the room located on the west end. In 1904, an adjoining house was built, and the family relocated. Subsequently, the Bunnells sold the creamery to the Lakeview ward of the LDS church, who deemed to use it as a tithing office. The Bunnell family re-purchased the building back in approximately 1920 for use as a granary and occasionally to rent the west room out.

He achieved the height of his success in the United States in the years 1908-1916 in the cities of Boston, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia, and again from 1926-1928 in Chicago. While he sang a broad repertoire from the French, German, and Italian repertoires, he was most celebrated for his performances in the operas of Giuseppe Verdi. His voice is preserved on more than 20 recordings made by Edison Records. Early life and career Born in Venice, Polese studied singing in his native city and made his professional singing debut performing there in a concert in 1892. He made his opera debut in 1894 at the Teatro Unione in Viterbo as Barnaba in Amilcare Ponchielli's La Gioconda. He was also heard that year as Don Carlo in Ernani in Viterbo; as Enrico in Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor and Tonio in Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci at the Teatro Andreani in Mantova; and in a small role in Alberto Franchetti's Cristoforo Colombo at the Teatro Regio in Turin. In 1895 he returned to Turin to sing Enrico to the Lucia of Regina Pinkert, and perform Lescaut in Giacomo Puccini's Manon Lescaut. He returned to Turin several more times during his career, notably creating the role of Count Narval in Arturo Buzzi Peccia's La forza d'amore in 1897. Over the next thirteen years, Polese performed leading opera roles all over Europe. He performed in operas in Athens, Bari, Bucharest, Cadiz, Cagliari, Cremona, Florence, Forl√¨, Genoa, Lemberg, Lonigo, Lisbon, Macerata, Madrid, Modena, Novara, Odessa, Palermo, Parma, Reggio Emilia, Rome, Seville, Trieste, Udine, and Vienna among other cities. Outside of Europe, he made appearances in Argentina (1901), Chile (1898), Egypt (1904‚Äì1906), and Mexico (1906). Some of the roles he performed during these years were Albert in Werther, Alfio in Cavalleria rusticana, Alphonse in La favorite, Amonasro in Aida, Antonio in Linda di Chamounix, Athana√´l in Tha√Øs, Caoudal in Sapho, Conte di Luna in Il trovatore, De Siriex in Fedora, Don Carlo in La forza del destino, Dr Malatesta in Don Pasquale, Escamillo in Carmen, Figaro in The Barber of Seville, Friedrich of Telramund in Lohengrin, Ford in Falstaff, Gerard in Andrea Chenier, Germont in La traviata, Guglielmo in Le Villi, the High Priest of Dagon in Samson and Delilah, Kurwenal in Tristan und Isolde, Kyoto in Iris, Lescaut in Jules Massenet's Manon, Marcello in La boh√®me, Nevers in Les Huguenots, Renato in Un ballo in maschera, Riccardo Forth in I puritani, Scarpia in Tosca, Sharpless in Madama Butterfly, Silvio in Pagliacci, Valentin in Faust, Wolfram in Tannh√§user, and the title roles in Guillaume Tell and Rigoletto. Singing and teaching in the United States From 1908-1910, Polese was a member of Oscar Hammerstein I's Manhattan Opera Company in New York City and their sister company in Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Opera Company. During that time he was heard at the Manhattan Opera House in New York as Alfio, Amonasro, Enrico, Figaro, Marcello, Nevers, Riccardo, Rigoletto, and Scarpia. He also performed those role at the Philadelphia Opera House, and was also heard in Philadelphia as the Count di Luna, Germont, Iago in Otello, Tonio, and Valentine. After both of Hammerstein's opera companies dissolved in 1910, Polese joined the roster of artists at the Boston Opera Company where he remained committed through 1913. At the Boston Opera House he performed the roles of Alfio, Amonasro, Count di Luna, Enrico, Figaro, Germont, Jack Rance in La Fanciulla del West, Marcello, Rafaele in I gioielli della Madonna, Riccardo, Scarpia, Sharpless, and Tonio. In the Fall of 1913 he left the Boston Opera to join the Chicago Grand Opera Company (CGOC) where he made his debut as Marcello. With the company he notably performed the role of Don Fulgenzio in the world premiere of Attilio Parelli's I dispettosi amanti (1912), and portrayed Egisto in the United States premiere of Vittorio Gnecchi's Cassandra (1914). He also performed the roles of Amonasro, Count di Luna, Enrico, Germont, and Rafaele for the company. He also made guest appearances with the Baltimore Opera Company (1912, 1914), and appeared in operas in Springfield (1911), Portland (1911), New Haven (1912) and Minneapolis (1914). After the CGOC went bankrupt in 1915, Polese returned briefly to Europe to perform in operas in Carrara, Verona, and at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa. He returned to Chicago in 1916 to join the newly formed Chicago Opera Association. He performed one season with company, portraying the roles of Alfio, Enrico, Ford, Germont, and Sharpless. With the outbreak of World War I he returned to Italy, and was not seen again on the stage until 1918 when he appeared in operas in Como, Ferrara, and New York. He then retired from the stage and began teaching singing in New York City and later in Boston. He came out of retirement in 1926 to join the roster of artists at the Chicago Civic Opera. He sang three seasons with that company, performing the roles of Abim√©lech and the High Priest of Dagon in Samson and Delilah, Count di Luna, Ford, and Herr von Faninal in Der Rosenkavalier. His final opera performance was as the High Priest in Chicago in January 1928. He thereafter taught singing in Boston up into the last year of his life. He died in 1952 in Induno Olona, Italy.

It was directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, produced by Tarak Ben Ammar and co-produced by Doha Film Institute. The film stars Tahar Rahim, Antonio Banderas, Freida Pinto, Mark Strong and Riz Ahmed.The Guardian The film had a budget of US$40 million. Plot In the early 20th century, Emir Nesib (Antonio Banderas), Sultan of Hobeika, and Sultan Amar (Mark Strong) of Salmaah have been in a border war over a vast barren strip they call \\"The Yellow Belt\\". When Nesib wins he forces Amar to agree to a peace pact: the Yellow Belt will belong to neither, becoming a no-man's-land between their territories, and Emir Nesib will take Sultan Amar's sons, Saleh and Auda, as hostages. Amar reluctantly agrees, knowing the hostages are a sacred trust which binds Nesib as well. They both swear to the pact before God. Nesib promises to rear Amar's sons with his own children, Tariq and Leyla. Saleh, Amar's eldest son, is a free spirit interested in the traditional pursuits of an Arab emir, while Auda is an avid reader. Leyla and Auda become good friends, until they are separated at adolescence. Ten years pass. Auda (Tahar Rahim) is still a voracious reader, while Saleh (Akin Gazi) longs to go home and be with his father. Sam Thurkettle (Corey Johnson), a geologist working for the western \\"Texan Oil\\" company, surveys the Yellow Belt and is convinced there is high-grade crude oil under its shale. He tells Nesib that the find will make him richer than the King of England, and Nesib is more than willing to listen; he has had to watch, powerless and penniless, as his people suffered a cholera epidemic and his own wife died from it. Nesib allows Thurkettle's company to extract oil from the Yellow Belt - thus violating his peace pact with Sultan Amar. Money pours in and Nesib starts to modernize his kingdom with schools, hospitals, and electricity. He makes his son Tariq a Colonel, appoints Auda his national librarian, and sends an envoy to Amar to strike a deal to extract oil from the Yellow Belt. But desert tribesmen attack one of the oil sites and kill the crew. Their revenues threatened, Nesib sets about inducing the various tribes to accept the oil extraction, using lavish gifts and gold as inducements. The envoy sent to Amar returns and reports to Nesib: Amar considers the exploitation of Yellow Belt a violation of their treaty. Saleh tells Auda that he can convince their father and decides to escape; he kills his guards while making his escape. He is caught, but Ibn Idris kills him in revenge for killing the guards, who were Ibn Idris's cousins. Desperate to maintain the oil revenues, Nesib executes a brilliant political maneuver: he marries Auda to his daughter Leyla (Freida Pinto). At one stroke he has converted Auda's position from hostage to family member, thereby dissolving his pact with Amar and absolving himself from his religious oath. Auda reluctantly agrees, knowing it is a plot to prevent Amar from attacking Nesib. Nesib decides to send Auda to convince Amar into extracting oil from the yellow belt. Auda meets Amar, who is surprised to learn that Auda has come as a representative of Nesib. Auda learns more about his father during his stay there. Amar tells Auda that Nesib offered 5%, then 35% of the earnings but he refused the offer. Nissib has even promised to give back Amar's sons as some kind of property value. When Auda tries to explain to him, he says that everything in his home is made either out of blood or love, but not money and that money has no value. The following day a meeting is held with Amar's allies. They say that by letting foreigners extract oil, they let themselves and their culture be destroyed. Auda unsuccessfully argues by saying if God had not meant for them to use it, he wouldn't have put it in their soil. Amar sends an envoy, Hassan Dakhil, to Nesib offering to cease all hostilities if Nesib agrees to shut down the oil wells and expel the foreigners. Nesib refuses and makes a counter offer to Hassan Dakhil. Later Amar receives a message from Hassan that seemingly indicates that Hassan has defected to Nesib. Following this setback, Amar makes a plan to send all of his prisoners into the desert with weapon props to act as decoys, in order to lure Nesib's army into the desert by while Amar takes his real army to capture Nesib's city, Hobeika. He offers the leadership of the decoy army to Auda. Auda protests, objecting that to send the prisoners into the desert would mean certain death, but in the face of his father's disapproval he reluctantly agrees and ventures out, accompanied by his half brother Ali, a doctor, who does not seem to share their father's xenophobic mindset. The plan works and Nesib sends six armored cars after them. However the heavy cars are stuck in the sands and Auda's men are able to overpower their occupants, though not without heavy losses. The camel carrying the carrier pigeons is killed and the pigeons escape. One of them manages to make it way back to Salmaah. The blood on the pigeon along with the absence of a written message leads Amar to believe that there have been no survivors. When the armored cars fail to return, Nesib sends a plane with Tariq on board to reconnoiter. Auda sets another decoy, having his men lie down and play dead around a destroyed armored car. When Tariq lands to investigate, Auda's men swarm him. Tariq manages to make it back to the plane, but Auda's men force it down. Auda finds his body in the ensuing wreckage and is overcome with remorse at all the needless deaths. He rallies the remaining prisoners and offers to divide the remaining water between them and set them free. The prisoners decide to follow Auda, who leads them to the sea believing that they would find water there, based from what he had heard from a dying camel rider. The army, now Auda's army, finally arrive at the sea but are disheartened to find no fresh water, until Ali finds an underwater spring. Having refilled their water skins, the army moves away and comes upon a Beni Sirri slaver tribe. Auda leads a small group of men to meet the Sheikh of Beni Sirri tribe and during the meeting the Sheikh beats Aicha (Liya Kebede), a slave girl, brutally. The Sheikh seemingly holds the slave's Zamiri tribe in derision as the Zamiri are one of the few tribes that allow women the same freedoms that are given to men. Auda tries to protest and offers to buy the slave girl in exchange for his mother's ring, who belonged to the same tribe as the slave girl. An argument ensues, and the Sheikh reveals that Nesib has already bought the loyalty of the Beni Sirri and that they intended to kill him in exchange of a reward. The rest of Auda's men launch a surprise attack, surrounding and overwhelming the Beni Sirri, leaving Auda to handcuff and disgrace the leaders of Beni Sirri tribe and freeing the slaves. To add insult to injury, Ali relieves the sheikh of the gold watch given to him by Nesib at Auda's wedding. In gratitude for freeing the slaves, the other tribes pledge their own resources to Auda. Aicha offers to lead Auda back to her own tribe in order to enlist their aid. However Auda is mistakenly shot by one of the tribe and seems to have been killed, only to revive in the middle of his own funeral rites. Ali realizes that Auda's condition had in fact been a medical phenomenon known as mors putativa in which a head trauma induces all the symptoms of death. However the tribals believe that Auda has been revived from death in the manner of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and that he is the leader foretold in the legends of the Zamiri tribe. Ali, despite knowing the true nature of Auda's injuries, does nothing to dissuade this notion. The Zamiri tribe now rallies around Auda as their leader. One of Nesib's planes manages to track them down and opens fire. The tribals manage to shoot down the plane, but not before it fatally wounds Ali. Auda administers his last rites as Ali lies dying in his arms. With his last breath Ali makes Auda promise to 'overturn the chessboard' in effect asking him to depose both Amar and Nessib, thereby putting an end to the conflict. Auda rides with his army to the gates of Nessib's city. Amar arrives and meets Auda, who reveals that he has united all the other tribes and intends to keep the Yellow Belt for them. Amar reveals that Nesib has agreed to Amar's conditions and demands that Auda turn over his army to Amar. During the discussion, Amar is shot dead by the sheikh of the Beni Sirri tribe, who had in fact been aiming for Auda. Auda's army is outraged, believing that Nessib had double crossed them and tried to kill Auda during the negotiations. Nessib's army commander realizes that with Amar dead, there is nothing to stop Auda from attacking. As the shells rain down, Auda gives up any hope for talks and leads his army to sweep over Nessib's defenses. Though Nessib has superior weaponry, the combined might of all the tribes in Auda's army overwhelms them by sheer numbers. Auda is knocked off his horse by a stray shell and beset upon by the Beni Sirri sheikh. The sheikh easily defeats him at close quarters combat and mocks him, asking whether Auda learned to fence 'in a library'. Just before the sheikh can land the killing blow, Aicha stabs him in the back and saves Auda. Learning about the developments, Nesib abdicates the throne in favor of his only remaining child, Leyla. Auda, through his marriage to Leyla is now ruler of both cities. In the city, Auda's forces find Hassan in the dungeons, indicating that he had never betrayed Amar, but had instead been held prisoner by Nesib. Auda walks into the library where he finds Nesib, who compliments him on his achievements and asks what Auda intends to do. Auda replies that unlike his father, he does not dislike foreigners and that he believes that they have much to offer each other. On being questioned by Auda about what to do with Nessib, he admits that if he were in Auda's place he would have had him killed, quickly and painlessly. Auda instead opts to send him to Houston to sit on the Board of Directors of the oil companies, where he can protect the interests of their people.

The complex was designed by Charles W. Moore, Donlyn Lyndon, William Turnbull, Jr. and Richard Whitaker of the MLTW partnership in 1963‚Äì1964, and was built by contractor Matthew Sylvia in 1965. The timber-framed structure overlooks the Pacific Ocean. It has been described as one of the most significant architectural designs of the 1960s in California, and has received numerous awards. Description Condominium 1 is located on the edge of a cliff overlooking the Pacific. It is a complex of ten condominium units, intended to be seen as a single structure. The design was inspired by barns and other farm buildings in the region and, with the help of landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, was built to take into account the local ecology. The timber frame is clad in vertical redwood siding, with vertical forms resembling mine structures anchoring a series of sloping roofs that descend toward the ocean, perforated by skylights. Windows are plain openings without trim or mullions. There are no eaves or significant fascia trim. On the uphill side the building wraps around a courtyard that houses the units' garages. Interior spaces feature the full range of MLTW-developed design elements. The 10-unit structure was Moore's first major work. It exemplifies Moore's \\"shed style\\" with single-pitched roofs, board siding, and plain detailing. The style, with its emphasis on a partnership with the site, was a break from the International Style. The design principles established by Condominium 1 included the use of what Moore termed aedicules, small intimate spaces defined by four columns and a canopy, and \\"saddlebags\\", small projections of the interior space to the exterior that provide a view or a contemplative space. The units are arranged with horizontal and vertical view lines through the space. Reception The condominium was featured in an extensive public relations campaign to promote the Sea Ranch development and appeared in Newsweek, the New York Times, and Life, as well as design magazines such as Perspecta and Japan Architect. It received a design citation from Progressive Architect, a California Governor's Design Award in 1966 and an American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 1967. In 1991 it received the AIA Twenty-five Year Award and Moore was awarded the AIA Gold Medal. The structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

He became a medical officer in Kenya in 1904, and remained in the colonial service in Africa for their next sixteen years. Leys, whose Christian Socialism informed his belief in racial equality,John Saville, 'Britain: Internationalism and the Labour Movement between the wars', in F. L. van Holthoon & Marcel van der Linden, eds., Internationalism in the labour movement, 1830-1940, Vol. 2., p.572 became an outspoken critic of the way in which the arrival of white planters had impacted Africans. In 1920 he responded to the \\"Black Horror on the Rhine\\"campaign orchestrated by E. D. Morel against the French use of African Troops in the occupation of the Rhineland. Whereas Morel had claimed that African troops were particularly prone to rape, Leys denied this - based on 17 years experience in tropical Africa and further stated that such allegations constituted ‚Äúone of the great sources of race hatred‚Äù and ‚Äúshould never be repeated by any honest man or honest newspaper.‚Äù Kenya (1924), with an introduction by Gilbert Murray, was reprinted in 1925 and 1926. Disappointed by the East African policies of the first and second Labour governments, Leys resigned from the Advisory Committee to the Labour Party in April 1931. In 1938, with Leonard Barnes and Julius Lewin, he founded a socialist journal, Empire, subsequently taken over by the Fabian Colonial Bureau. In February 1939 Leys drafted a memorandum for the Labour Party arguing against the colour bar: the memo was incorporated into a draft by Leonard Woolf which became an official Labour Party document in 1943.

In graph drawing, the angular resolution of a drawing of a graph is the sharpest angle formed by any two edges that meet at a common vertex of the drawing. Properties =Relation to vertex degree= observed that every straight-line drawing of a graph with maximum degree has angular resolution at most : if is a vertex of degree , then the edges incident to partition the space around into wedges with total angle , and the smallest of these wedges must have an angle of at most . More strongly, if a graph is -regular, it must have angular resolution less than \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{d-1}, because this is the best resolution that can be achieved for a vertex on the convex hull of the drawing. =Relation to graph coloring= As showed, the largest possible angular resolution of a graph is closely related to the chromatic number of the square , the graph on the same vertex set in which pairs of vertices are connected by an edge whenever their distance in is at most two. If can be colored with colors, then G may be drawn with angular resolution , for any , by assigning distinct colors to the vertices of a regular -gon and placing each vertex of close to the polygon vertex with the same color. Using this construction, they showed that every graph with maximum degree has a drawing with angular resolution proportional to . This bound is close to tight: they used the probabilistic method to prove the existence of graphs with maximum degree whose drawings all have angular resolution O\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\log d}{d^2}\\\\right). =Existence of optimal drawings= provided an example showing that there exist graphs that do not have a drawing achieving the maximum possible angular resolution; instead, these graphs have a family of drawings whose angular resolutions tend towards some limiting value without reaching it. Specifically, they exhibited an 11-vertex graph that has drawings of angular resolution for any , but that does not have a drawing of angular resolution exactly . Special classes of graphs =Trees= Every tree may be drawn in such a way that the edges are equally spaced around each vertex, a property known as perfect angular resolution. Moreover, if the edges may be freely permuted around each vertex, then such a drawing is possible, without crossings, with all edges unit length or higher, and with the entire drawing fitting within a bounding box of polynomial area. However, if the cyclic ordering of the edges around each vertex is already determined as part of the input to the problem, then achieving perfect angular resolution with no crossings may sometimes require exponential area.; . =Outerplanar graphs= Perfect angular resolution is not always possible for outerplanar graphs, because vertices on the convex hull of the drawing with degree greater than one cannot have their incident edges equally spaced around them. Nonetheless, every outerplanar graph of maximum degree has an outerplanar drawing with angular resolution proportional to .; . =Planar graphs= For planar graphs with maximum degree , the square-coloring technique of provides a drawing with angular resolution proportional to , because the square of a planar graph must have chromatic number proportional to . More precisely, Wegner conjectured in 1977 that the chromatic number of the square of a planar graph is at most \\\\max\\\\left(d+5, \\\\frac{3d}{2}+1\\\\right), and it is known that the chromatic number is at most \\\\frac{5d}{3}+O(1).; . However, the drawings resulting from this technique are generally not planar. For some planar graphs, the optimal angular resolution of a planar straight-line drawing is , where is the degree of the graph.. Additionally, such a drawing may be forced to use very long edges, longer by an exponential factor than the shortest edges in the drawing. used the circle packing theorem and ring lemma to show that every planar graph with maximum degree has a planar drawing whose angular resolution is at worst an exponential function of , independent of the number of vertices in the graph. Computational complexity It is NP-hard to determine whether a given graph of maximum degree has a drawing with angular resolution , even in the special case that .; . However, for certain restricted classes of drawings, including drawings of trees in which extending the leaves to infinity produces a convex subdivision of the plane as well as drawings of planar graphs in which each bounded face is a centrally-symmetric polygon, a drawing of optimal angular resolution may be found in polynomial time.; . History Angular resolution was first defined by . Although originally defined only for straight-line drawings of graphs, later authors have also investigated the angular resolution of drawings in which the edges are polygonal chains,; . circular arcs,; . or spline curves.; . The angular resolution of a graph is closely related to its crossing resolution, the angle formed by crossings in a drawing of the graph. In particular, RAC drawing seeks to ensure that these angles are all right angles, the largest crossing angle possible. Notes References *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *.

He is best known for his female nudes, painted in a fashion similar to that of his friends Frederick Carl Frieseke, Lawton S. Parker, and Richard E. Miller, all American artists who studied and lived in France. Ritman was born in Kamianets-Podilskyi, Russia (now Ukraine), and moved with his family to Chicago around 1900. He took a drawing class at Hull House, then attended the Art Institute's school, the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, and briefly the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, then in 1909 moved to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris at the advice of Parker to continue his studies. Ritman was a member of the second generation of American artists to work in Giverny, where he first painted in 1911 and would continue to summer for the next twenty years. He and his contemporaries preferred the female nude as their subject, painted in dappled sunlight or in chromatic interiors. While his work bears strong similarities to Frieseke's, art historian William H. Gerdts notes \\"an appealing wistfulness which is also quite distinct.\\"Gerdts, 89 The influence of Paul C√©zanne may be seen in the more structural, blocky brushstrokes of paintings after the mid- 1910s. In 1929 Ritman returned to the United States to instruct at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, yet continued to visit France until the end of his life. He died in Winona, Minnesota.

The style is a growing trend within businesses and is characterized by a form of transformational leadership style. The feminine style of management, although characterized by traits commonly labeled as feminine, it is not a style of management that is only used by females; it is also a style which has been found beneficial for particular types of businesses and organizations. Historical development =Early 1900s= Beginning with textile mills and the shoe-making industry of post- revolutionary America, the first real appearance of an explosion of women in a general workforce, whether at home or manufacturing, came at the turn of the century. By World War I, many women were poised to join the workforce as a high population of men served in the war. As men returned from the war and a falling economy led to the Great Depression, women suffered displacement. By World War II there was a similar growth of women in business that had been previously reserved for men. The combination of a better economy and a quickly changing standard of society norms, many women's roles and functions in business steadily increased following World II. =1970s‚Äì1980s= In the 1970s feminist authors denied or minimized the differences between men and women to establish that women had similar talents to men and should have equal labor opportunities. In Schutlz v. Wheaton Glass Co., a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled jobs held by men must be \\"substantially equal\\" but not \\"identical\\" to fall under the protection of the Equal Pay Act and that it is therefefore illegal for employers to change the job titles of women workers in order to pay them less than men. However, as the 1980s began, differences were more emphasized and noted as a means of progression due to the management style differences that came of feminine values and ways of behaving, feeling, and thinking. =1990‚Äìpresent= In 1991, women represented 45% of all managerial positions. Currently, although the feminine management style can be found being utilized throughout organizations internationally now, barriers to acceptance of this management style include stereotype and perceptions, mentoring and networking availability, workplace discrimination, family related issues, as well as funding availability. However, the rise in female leaders is a result of changing theories and practices of leadership. Gendered organizations Reasons a systematic theory of gender and organizations is necessary: # The gender segregation of work, including divisions between paid and unpaid work, is partly created through organizational practices. # Related to gender segregation, income and status inequality between women and men is also partly created in organizational processes; understanding these processes is necessary for understanding gender inequality. # Organizations are one arena in which widely disseminated cultural images of gender are invented and reproduced. Knowledge of cultural productions is important for understanding gender construction. # Some aspects of individual gender identity, perhaps particularly masculinity, are also products of organizational processes and pressures. # An important feminist project is to make large-scale organizations more democratic and more supportive of humane goals. =Gendering interaction processes= In addition to the reasons that it is necessary to examine feminine styles of management within theories of gendered organizations, Acker adds, is because gendering occurs in at least five different interacting processes. * First, the construction of divisions along lines of gender-division of labor, of allowed behaviors, of locations in physical space, of power, including the institutionalized means of maintaining the divisions in the structures of labor markets, the family, the state. * Second, the construction of symbols and images that explain, express, reinforce, or sometimes oppose those divisions. * Third, interactions between women and men, women and women, men and men, including all those patterns that enact dominance and submission. * Fourth, processes help to produce gendered components of individual identity, which may include consciousness of the existence of the other three aspects of gender, such as, in organizations, choice of appropriate work, language use, clothing, and presentation of self as a gendered member of an organization. * Finally, gender is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualizing social structures. Characteristics =Types of management= Within the three main types of managerial styles, studies have examined differences in masculine and feminine styles. The first is the task management style, or how much a leader initiates, organizes, and/or defines work activities and processes. The second style,an interpersonal based style, which is a style where generally the leader builds morale, relationships, satisfaction, and commitment in the organization. Lastly, the third is the group decision making style, which is when the leader encourages a participative, democratic approach =Feminine style characteristics= Some studies find differences between males' and females' task accomplishment styles and interpersonal styles. Males tended to be more task-oriented; females tended to be more relationship-oriented. These differences, however, have been observed only in men and women subjects of laboratory experiments, that is, people asked to speculate how they would behave if they were leaders. Management traditionally been male dominated and constructed in masculine terms. Present ideas involving femininity in management include transforming places of work into relation-oriented, flexible, and humane institutions. Differences disappear in studies where actual managers are compared: most conclude that women do not behave differently from men in the same or similar kind of leadership position. Moreover, experienced women managers show no differences in leadership abilities from experienced male managers. These women, in fact, are likely to more closely resemble their male counterparts in drive, skills, temperament, and competitiveness, than the average woman in the population. Anne Cummings stated, \\"\\"The notion of what makes an effective leader is changing, and you will find both [traditionally defined] ‚Äòmasculine‚Äô and ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô components.\\" In order for women to make an impact within an organization as an executive they need to be aware of their leadership styles and strengths. Examples =Examples in research= In 1990, Alice Eagly and Johnson conducted a study on gender and leadership and found results they later emphasized with supporting meta-analysis data. Specifically, in 1992 and 1995, researchers Eagly and Johnson also conducted meta-analysis on the effectiveness and evaluation, respectively, of differing management styles. The results showed that the main difference in management styles in men and women were that women are more democratic, while men were found to generally be more autocratic, however, the studies show little evidence that would suggest males and females differ in their leadership effectiveness. This means that women tend to be more focused on encouraging participation and involving their workforce in business decisions while men are more focused on encouraging performance and driving towards tangible production. In 2003, a meta-analysis was conducted by Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and Van Engen that compared male and female managers on measures of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles; their findings emphasized the results of their previous study. The meta-analysis study showed that women were slightly more likely than men to exercise a transformational leadership style. This is a style of management that is likely to be used by coaches, teachers, and other individuals focused on developing subordinates. The transformational leadership encourages participation and creative problem solving. Eagly proposes that the transformational style of management is likely more advantageous for women to employ however. Men were shown to be more likely to critique their employees and be less interactive, in contrast to the women who utilized a more \\"hands-on\\" approach. In contrast, research in the past few decades shows that these results are only averages. Men and Women do not show a significant difference in these management styles, only slight differences. Some men proved to use more feminine styles, while some women proved to use more masculine styles. Eagly states that,\\"the sex differences are small because the leader role itself carries a lot of weight in determining people's behavior.\\"\\" In 2005, a year-long study conducted by Caliper, a Princeton, New Jersey-based management consulting firm, and Aurora, a London-based organization that advances women, identified a number of characteristics that distinguish women leaders from men when it comes to qualities of leadership: Women leaders are more assertive and persuasive, have a stronger need to get things done and are more willing to take risks than male leaders....Women leaders were also found to be more empathetic and flexible, as well as stronger in interpersonal skills than their male counterparts....enabling them to read situations accurately and take information in from all sides....These women leaders are able to bring others around to their point of view....because they genuinely understand and care about where others are coming from....so that the people they are leading feel more understood, supported and valued. These findings were summarized into four specific statements about women's leadership qualities: (1) Women leaders are more persuasive than their male counterparts, (2) When feeling the sting of rejection, women leaders learn from adversity and carry on with an \\"I'll show you\\" attitude, (3) Women leaders demonstrate an inclusive, team-building leadership style of problem solving and decision making, (4) Women leaders are more likely to ignore rules and take risks. BET's CEO, Debra Lee, explains that it is easy to generalize the differences in gender leadership styles as \\"women do it this way, and men do it that way.\\" Instead of simply generalizing, Debra Lee asserts that it is important to discuss these differences so that women don't feel uncomfortable managing differently from men. During this interview she further states that we should encourage young women to climb the corporate ladder. Lee explained that her hardest lesson was learning to follow her gut when others challenged it, but that lesson has truly paid off. She insists that we encourage young women to do the same. It's vital for women to embrace these differences. During a 2006 speech given by Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, the World YWCA Secretary General, she explained that the attitudes toward leadership are changing and what women offer is essential. She stated: \\"Domination as a leadership style is becoming less and less popular. There is a new growing appreciation of....those traits that women use to keep families together and to organize volunteers to unite and make change in the shared life of communities. These newly admired leadership qualities of shared leadership; nurturance and doing good for others are today not only sought after but also indeed needed to make a difference in the world....A feminine way of leading includes helping the world to understand and be principled about values that really matter.\\" =Recent examples in global society= The feminine style of management embodying organizational progression, more and more female leaders are found within society today. In addition to the thousands of women who now receive graduate and doctoral degrees, many hold managerial positions within companies, and females hold 45% of all managerial posts. Today, many nonprofit organizations take a feminine style of leadership approach when handling employees. These particular organizations tend to encourage participation among group members, show flexibility, and maintain a non-hierarchical work environment.Questioning the notion of feminine leadership: a critical perspective on the gender labeling of leadership, Yvonne Due Billing & Mats Alvesson, Gender, Work and Organization, 7(3), 2000, pp 144-157 Leaders that take on this style tend to show genuine care and understanding towards their employees. The empathy they have for others enables their employees to feel as though they are recognized and valued within the organization. These leaders are also known for their communication skills and tendency to listen to multiple perspective before making decisions.\\"Women Leaders Study: The Qualities That Distinguish Women Leaders.\\" Caliperonline.com. Their desire to use team-building activities creates a sense of community within organizations, which in turn helps to meet overall goals.Kanyoro, Musimbi. \\"Challenges to Women's Leadership.\\" Speech in honor of YWCA of Salt Lake centennial celebration. 13 July 2006. An example of a company using team-building, genuinely understand its employees needs, and embracing femininity is Mary Kay Cosmetics. This company strives to treat employees as individuals and help them reach their personal goals. When employees meet particular sales goals they are rewarded with things they desire, such as pink Cadillacs and diamonds. These actions show employees that they are valued and understood, which leads to a positive corporate culture.Knowledge@Wharton (2005). \\"The 'Masculine' and 'Feminine' Sides of Leadership and Culture: Perception vs. Reality.\\" Sung-Joo Kim, chairman and chief executive of luxury-goods company MCM Worldwide, is an example of a woman using the feminine style of management to help successfully run a company. Kim's sensitivity and openness towards employees gives her an advantage over other luxury-good corporations. Kim has to find a balance between her sensitivity and still maintaining order and a level of toughness. Kim grew up in a patriarchal Korean household and her experiences led her to strive to prove to others that femininity and power are not mutually exclusive and it is quite possible to be a nurturing woman and still run a successful business.Covel, Simona. (2008). \\"The Benefits of a 'Feminine' Leadership Style.\\" According to Esther Wachs Book, \\"A new breed of leader is emerging, and that breed is female.\\" She contends that women, such as Meg Whitman of eBay and Marcy Carsey of Carsey-Werner, succeed because they embody seven uniquely female abilities: they can sell their visions; they are not afraid to reinvent the rules; they are focused on achievement; they show courage under fire; they turn challenges into opportunities; they are aware of customer preferences; and they maximize what Book calls \\"high touch\\" in an era of high tech.

Though the collection was therefore formed entirely after the invention of printing, luxury illuminated manuscripts continued to be commissioned by royalty in England as elsewhere until well into the 16th century. The collection was expanded under Henry VIII by confiscations in the Dissolution of the Monasteries and after the falls of Henry's ministers Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell. Many older manuscripts were presented to monarchs as gifts; perhaps the most important manuscript in the collection, the Codex Alexandrinus, was presented to Charles I in recognition of the diplomatic efforts of his father James I to help the Eastern Orthodox churches under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. The date and means of entry into the collection can only be guessed at in many if not most cases. Now the collection is closed in the sense that no new items have been added to it since it was donated to the nation. The collection is not to be confused with the Royal Collection of various types of art still owned by the Crown, nor the King's Library of printed books, mostly assembled by George III, and given to the nation by his son George IV, which is also in the British Library, as is the Royal Music Library, a collection mostly of scores and parts both printed (about 4,500 items) and in manuscript (about 1,000), given in 1957.Royal Music Library, British Library The Royal manuscripts were deposited in 1707 in Cotton House, Westminster with the Cotton Library, which was already a form of national collection under trustees, available for consultation by scholars and antiquaries; the site is now covered by the Houses of Parliament. The collection escaped relatively lightly in the fire of 1731 at Ashburnham House, to which the collections had been moved. The Cotton Library was one of the founding collections of the British Museum in 1753, and four years later the Royal collection was formally donated to the new institution by the king. It moved to the new British Library when this was established in 1973. The 9,000 printed books that formed the majority of the Old Royal Library were not kept as a distinct collection in the way the manuscripts were, and are dispersed among the library's holdings. The Royal manuscripts, and those in other British Library collections with royal connections, were the focus of an exhibition at the British Library \\"Royal Manuscripts: The Genius of Illumination\\" in 2011‚Äì2012.Genius Highlights *Codex Alexandrinus, a 5th- century manuscript of the Greek Bible, one of the four Great uncial codices. *Gospel Book (British Library, MS Royal 1.

There are only about twenty surviving manuscripts that probably belonged to the English kings and queens between Edward I and Henry VI,Stratford, 256 though the number expands considerably when the princes and princesses are included. A few Anglo-Saxon manuscripts owned by royalty have survived after being presented to the church, among them a Gospel Book, Royal 1. B. VII, given to Christ Church, Canterbury by King Athelstan in the 920s, which probably rejoined the collection at the Dissolution of the Monasteries.Brown, 52, 87 However these works are scattered among a variety of libraries. By the late Middle Ages luxury manuscripts would generally include the heraldry of the commissioner, especially in the case of royalty, which is an important means of identifying the original owner. There are patchy documentary records which mention many more, though the royal library was from about 1318 covered in the records of the \\"Chamber\\", which have survived far less completely than the pipe rolls of the main Exchequer. The careful inventories of the French royal library have no English equivalent until a list compiled at Richmond Palace in 1535.Stratford, 255-256 At the start of Edward III's reign there was a significant library kept in the Privy Wardrobe of the Tower of London, partly built up from confiscations from difficult members of the nobility, which were often later returned. Many books were given away, as diplomatic, political or family gifts, but also (especially if in Latin rather than French) to \\"clerks\\" or civil servants of the royal administration, some receiving several at a time, such as Richard de Bury, perhaps England's leading bibliophile at the time as well as an important figure in the government, who received 14 books in 1328. By 1340 there were only 18 books left, although this probably did not include Edward's personal books.Stratford, 258-259 Historiated initial \\"S\\" from Psalm 69, \\"Save me, O God for the waters are come in unto my soul ... I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me\\", Royal MS 1 E IX, most likely Henry IV's Biblia Magna Despite the cultured nature of his court, and his encouragement of English poets, little is known of the royal books under Richard II, although one illuminated manuscript created in Paris for Charles VI of France to present to Richard, the Epistre au roi Richart of Philippe de M√©zi√®res (Royal 20. B. VI), was at Richmond in 1535, and is in the British Library Royal manuscripts.Stratford, 260 The reign of Henry IV has left records of the building of a novum studium (\\"new study\\") at Eltham Palace finely decorated with more than 78 square feet of stained glass, at a cost of ¬£13, and a prosecution involving nine missing royal books, including bibles in Latin and English, valued respectively at ¬£10 and ¬£5, the high figures suggesting they were illuminated.Stratford, 260-261 The wills of Henry's son, Henry V refer to a Biblia Magna (\\"Big\\" or \\"Great Bible\\"), which had belonged to Henry IV and was to be left to the nuns of Henry V's foundation at Syon. This may be Royal MS 1. E. IX, with fine historiated initials illuminated in London by several artists from the school of Herman Scheerre of Cologne.See:  A considerable number of religious texts were left to family members, staff and his many chaplains.Stratford, 263 Two of Henry V's younger brothers were notable collectors. Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (1390-1447), who had commissioned translations from Greek into Latin and gave most of his collection, 281 books, to the library at Oxford University, where the Bodleian Library later grew around Duke Humfrey's Library. At his death his remaining books mostly went to his nephew Henry VI's new Kings College, Cambridge, but some illuminated books in French were kept for the royal library, and are still in the Royal manuscripts. John, Duke of Bedford took over as English commander in France after Henry V's death in 1422, and commissioned two important manuscripts which have reached the British Library by other routes, the Parisian Bedford Hours (Ms Add 18850, in fact presented to Henry VI in 1431) and the English Bedford Psalter and Hours (BL Ms Add 42131). He also used the dominant English position in France to buy the French royal library of the Louvre, from which a few examples remain in the Royal manuscripts.Stratford, 266 =Edward IV to Henry VII= The death of Walter VI, Count of Brienne from one of Edward IV's histories, Royal MS 14 E v f.499v About fifty of the Royal manuscripts were acquired by Edward IV (1442-1483), a far larger and more coherent group than survive from any of his predecessors. He was not a scholarly man, and had to fight his way to the throne after inheriting the Yorkist claim to the throne at the age of eighteen after his father and elder brother died in battle. He reigned from 1461 until 1470, when machinations among the leading nobles forced a six-month period of exile in Burgundy. He stayed for some of this period in Bruges at the house of Louis de Gruuthuse, a leading nobleman in the intimate circle of Philip the Good, who had died three years before. Philip had the largest and finest library of illuminated manuscripts in Europe, with perhaps 600, and Gruuthuse was one of several Burgundian nobles who had begun to collect seriously in emulation. In 1470 his library (much of it now in Paris) was in its early stages, but must already have been very impressive for Edward. The Flemish illuminating workshops had by this date clearly overtaken those of Paris to become the leading centre in northern Europe, and English illumination had probably come to seem somewhat provincial. The Burgundian collectors were especially attracted to secular works, often with a military or chivalric flavour, that were illustrated with a lavishness rarely found in earlier manuscripts on such subjects. As well as generous numbers of miniatures, the borders were decorated in increasingly inventive and elaborate fashion, with much use of the heraldry of the commissioner.Backhouse, 267-268; Kren & McKendrick, 68-71 and generally Many of Edward's manuscripts reflected this taste; like that of Philip, his court displayed an increase in ceremonial formality, and interest in chivalry. Most of his books are large-format popular works in French, with several modern and ancient histories, and authors such as Boccaccio, Christine de Pisan and Alain Chartier. They are too large to hold comfortably, and may have been read aloud from lecterns, though the large miniatures were certainly intended to be appreciated. The largest purchases were probably made from about April 1479, when a part-payment is recorded to a foreign (\\"stranger\\") \\"merchant\\" or dealer for ¬£80 to \\"merchant stranger Philip Maisertuell in partie of paiement of ¬£240 of certaine bokes by the said Philip to be provided to the kyngs use in the parties beyond the see.\\" This was perhaps Philippe de Mazerolles, a leading illuminator who had moved from France to Flanders. At least six of Edward's Flemish books are dated to 1479 and 1480; such large books naturally took a considerable time to produce. Further payments totalling ¬£10 are recorded in 1480 for binding eight books, for which other payments record the transport to Eltham in special pine chests.Backhouse, 269 Other manuscripts are no longer in the Royal collection, such as the \\"Soane Josephus\\" (MS 1, Sir John Soane's Museum), which remained in the collection until after an inventory in 1666.Kren & McKendrick, 292-294 One of the most splendid books made for Edward in Bruges in the 1470s is a Bible historiale in French in three volumes (Royal MS 15 D i, 18 D ix-x), which was probably begun for another patron, then completed for Edward.Kren & McKendrick, 297-303 Edward's reign saw the beginning of printing, both in English in 1473-75 and in England itself from 1476, when William Caxton set up a press in Westminster. At the top end of the market the illuminated manuscript continued to retain a superior prestige for many decades. When Edward's brother in law, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers had Caxton print his own translation of the Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers in 1477, the book he presented to Edward was a special manuscript copied from the printed edition, with a presentation miniature, implying \\"that a printed book might not yet have been regarded as sufficiently distinguished for a formal gift of this kind\\".Backhouse, 269 Henry VII appears to have commissioned relatively few manuscripts, preferring French luxury printed editions (his exile had been spent in France). He also added his own arms to a number of earlier manuscripts, a common practice for those bought second-hand. One manuscript, Royal 19. C. VIII, was scribed at Sheen Palace in 1496 by the Flemish royal librarian, Quentin Poulet and then sent to Bruges to be illuminated, and another, Royal 16. F. II, appears to have been begun as a present for Edward IV, then left aside until completed with new miniatures and Tudor roses in about 1490, as a present for Henry.Kren & McKendrick, 403; 398-400 =Henry VIII to Elizabeth= Psalter of Henry VIII, 1540s, Henry shown reading Page with wolves from the Rochester Bestiary, Ms Royal 12. F. xiii, part of the spoils of the Dissolution of the Monasteries By the time Henry VIII came to the throne in 1509, the printed book had become the norm, though the richest buyers, like Henry, could often order copies printed on vellum. But some manuscripts were still commissioned and illuminated, and Henry and his minister Cardinal Wolsey were the main English patrons in the 1520s. Henry retained a scribe with the title \\"writer of the king's books\\", from 1530 employing the Fleming Pieter Meghen (1466/67 1540), who had earlier been used by Erasmus and Wolsey.Kren & McKendrick, 520 Although some Flemish illuminators were active in England, notably Lucas Horenbout (as well as his father Gerard and sister Susanna), it seems that more often the miniatures and painted decoration were done in Flanders or France, even if the text had been written in England. Meghen and Gerard Horenbout both worked on a Latin New Testament, mixing the gospels in the Vulgate with translations by Erasmus of Acts and the Apocalypse, which has the heraldry of Henry and Catherine of Aragon (Hatfield House MS 324).Alexander, 47-49 Henry also retained a librarian, paid ¬£10 a year in both 1509 and 1534, who in both years was based at Richmond Palace west of London, which seems to have been the location of the main collection.Carley (1999), 274; Doyle, 70-73 As well as more common northern European manuscripts, Henry also received Italian manuscripts illuminated in full-blown Renaissance style as gifts; at least three remain in the British Library.Alexander, 55 It was at Richmond that in 1535 a French visitor compiled the first surviving approach to a list of books in the royal library, though this was only covered the books there, and perhaps was not complete. He listed 143 books, which were nearly all in French, and included many of Edward IV's collection.Carley (1999), 274; Doyle, 71-72 This was just before Henry's Dissolution of the Monasteries, which was to greatly increase the size of the royal library. In 1533, before the dissolution began, Henry had commissioned John Leland to examine the libraries of religious houses in England. Leland was a young Renaissance humanist whose patrons included Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell and was a chaplain to the king with church benefices, by papal dispensation as he was not yet even a subdeacon. He spent much of the following years touring the country compiling lists of the most significant manuscripts, from 1536 being overtaken by the process of dissolution, as he complained in a famous letter to Cromwell. A large but unknown number of books were taken for the royal library, others were taken by the expelled monastics or private collectors, but many were simply left in the abandoned buildings; at St Augustine's, Canterbury there were still some remaining in the 17th century. Those preserved were often not the ones that modern interests would have preferred.Carley (2002), 341-342, 346-347; Carley (1999), 274-275 The monastic books were initially collected in libraries at the palaces of Westminster (later known as Whitehall), Hampton Court and Greenwich, though from around 1549 they were apparently all concentrated at Westminster. There is an inventory from April 1542 listing 910 books at Westminster, and there are press-marks on many books relating to this.Carley (1999), 275-276 It is often impossible to trace the origin of monastic manuscripts in or passing through the royal library - a large number of the books initially acquired were later dispersed to a new breed of antiquarian collectors. The priory of Rochester Cathedral was the source of manuscripts including the Rochester Bestiary, famous for its lively illustrations, and an unillustrated 11th- century manuscript of the Liber Scintillarum (Royal 7. C. iv) with interlinear Old English glosses. Very probably a good number of medieval liturgical manuscripts were destroyed for religious reasons under Edward VI. The librarian from 1549 was Bartholomew Traheron, an evangelical Protestant recommended by John Cheke. In January 1550 a letter was sent out from the Council instructing the country to \\"cull out all superstitious books, as missals, legends, and such like, and to deliver the garniture of the books, being either gold or silver, to Sir Anthony Aucher\\" (d. 1558, one of Henry's commissioners for the Dissolution in Kent). Despite the additions from the dissolved monasteries, the collection that survived is very short of medieval liturgical manuscripts, and a high proportion of those that do remain can be shown to have arrived under Mary I or the Stuarts. There are no illuminated missals at all, only eight other liturgical manuscripts, eighteen illuminated psalters and eight books of hours.Doyle, 73-75 Edward died at the age of 16, and was a solitary and studious boy, several of whose personal books are in the British Library. He seems to have centralized most of the library at Whitehall Palace, though Richmond still seems to have retained a collection to judge by the reports of later visitors.Doyle, 73-75 The significant addition to the library of Edward's reign, though only completed after his death, was the purchase from his widow of the manuscripts belonging to the reformer Martin Bucer, who had died in England. Mary I, who restored Catholicism, may have felt the lack of liturgical books, and was presented with at least two illuminated psalters, one the highly important English Queen Mary Psalter of 1310-1320 (Royal 2 B VII), confiscated from Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland after his arrest. This has in total over 1,000 illustrations, many in the English tinted drawing style. Another, Royal 2 B III, is a 13th-century production of Bruges, which was given by \\"your humbull and poore orytur Rafe, Pryne, grocer of Loundon, wushynge your gras prosperus helthe\\", as an inscription says.Doyle, 75, and catalogue entries 82 and 85 =Stuarts= The son of James I, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales (1594-1612), made a significant addition to the library by acquiring the library of John, Lord Lumley (c.1533-1609). Lumley had married the scholar and author Jane Lumley, who inherited the library of her father, Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel (1512-1580), which was among the most important private libraries of the period, with around 3,000 volumes, including much of the library of Archbishop Cranmer. A catalogue survives, a 1609 copy of an original of 1596 that is now lost; Lumley had also given many volumes to the universities in his last years. Soon after Prince Henry's death, the main royal library was moved to St James's Palace where his books had been kept.Selwyn, 51-52 The Lumley library included MS Royal 14. C. vii, with the Historia Anglorum and Chronica Maiora of Matthew Paris, which had passed from St Albans Abbey to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester and later Arundel.Chivalry, 390 James I purchased much of the library of the classical scholar Isaac Casaubon who died in London in 1614, and was given the Codex Alexandinus, as explained above. The royal library managed to survive relatively unscathed during the English Civil War and Commonwealth, partly because the well-known and aggressive figures on the Parliamentarian side of the preacher Hugh Peters (later executed as a regicide) and the lawyer and M.P. Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke were successively appointed as librarians by Parliament, and defended their charge. Whitelocke wanted the library turned into a national library accessible to all scholars, an idea already proposed by John Dee to Elizabeth I, and thereafter by Richard Bentley, the famous textual scholar who became librarian in 1693. There was a new inventory in 1666. The major purchase in the reign of Charles II was of 311 volumes in about 1678 from the collection of John Theyer, including the Westminster Psalter (Royal 2. A. xxii), a psalter of about 1200 from Westminster Abbey to which five tinted drawings were added some fifty years later, including the kneeling knight illustrated above.Chivalry, 200; BL catalogue Westminster Psalter, who give a later date for the main MS.

Congo report listing 10 years of atrocities, identifying justice options Its aim was to map the most serious violations of human rights, together with violations of international humanitarian law, committed within the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In doing this it was to assess the capacities within the national justice system to deal appropriately with such human rights violations and to formulate a series of options aimed at assisting the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in identifying appropriate transitional justice mechanisms to deal with the legacy of these violations. It contained 550 pages and contained descriptions of 617 alleged violent incidents. The mapping exercise began in 2008, with 33 staff working on the project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including Congolese and international human rights experts. The report was submitted to the High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay in 2009. The report contains a detailed accounting of the breakup of Hutu refugee camps in eastern Congo at the start of the First Congo War in October 1996, followed by the pursuit of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees and Hutu population across the country‚Äôs vast hinterland by teams of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda soldiers and their Congolese rebel surrogates, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo.Mapping Exercise Report: Involvement of neighbouring states  Context  In the wake of the discovery of three mass graves in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in late 2005, the United Nations first announced its intention to send a human rights team to conduct a mapping exercise in DRC in a June 2006 report to the Security Council. In May 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon approved the terms of reference of the mapping exercise following a series of consultations among relevant UN agencies and partners and with the Congolese government.RDC Projet Mapping Exercise The mapping exercise began officially on 17 July 2008, with the arrival of the team's chief in Kinshasa. Between October 2008 and May 2009, a total of 33 staff worked on the project in the DRC, including Congolese and international human rights experts. Of these, some 20 human rights officers were deployed across the country, operating out of five field offices, to gather documents and information from witnesses to meet the three objectives defined in the terms of reference. The report was submitted to the High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay on 15 June 2009 for review, comments and finalisation.  Research methodology  The mapping team's 550-page report contains descriptions of 617 alleged violent incidents occurring in the DRC between March 1993 and June 2003. Each of these incidents points to the possible commission of gross violations of human rights and/or international humanitarian law. Each of the incidents listed is backed up by at least two independent sources identified in the report. As serious as they may be, uncorroborated incidents claimed by one single source are not included. Over 1,500 documents relating to human rights violations committed during this period were gathered and analysed with a view to establishing an initial chronology by region of the main violent incidents reported. Only incidents meeting a 'gravity threshold' set out in the methodology were considered. Field mapping teams met with over 1,280 witnesses to corroborate or invalidate the violations listed in the chronology. Information was also collected on previously undocumented crimes. The 1,500 documents reviewed, some of them confidential, were obtained from many sources, including the United Nations, the Congolese government, Congolese and major international human rights organisations, national and international media and various unions, religious groups, aid agencies and victims‚Äô associations. Lastly, various sources, individuals and experts, national and international, were also consulted to open up new avenues of research, corroborate information and streamline the overall analysis.  Mandate and Objectives  The report states that the mapping team ‚Äúwas not concerned with pursuing in-depth investigations or gathering evidence of sufficient admissibility to stand in court‚Äù but rather with ‚Äúproviding the basis for the formulation of initial hypothesis of investigation by giving a sense of the scale of violations, detecting patterns and identifying potential leads or sources of evidence‚Äù. The mapping exercise, led by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with some US$ 3 million in funding, had three objectives:Terms of Reference of the DRC Mapping Exercise Team * Conduct a mapping exercise of the most serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed within the territory of the DRC between March 1993 and June 2003. * Assess the existing capacities within the national justice system to deal appropriately with such human rights violations that may be uncovered. * Formulate a series of options aimed at assisting the Government of the DRC in identifying appropriate transitional justice mechanisms to deal with the legacy of these violations, in terms of truth, justice, reparation and reform, taking into account ongoing efforts by the DRC authorities, as well as the support of the international community. Unlike some commissions of inquiry with a specific mandate to identify the perpetrators of violations and make them accountable for their actions, the objective of the Mapping Exercise was not to establish or to try to establish individual criminal responsibility. Instead, its aim was to expose in a transparent way the seriousness of the violations committed, with the aim of encouraging an approach aimed at breaking the cycle of impunity. The report does, however, identify the armed groups to which the alleged perpetrators belonged, since it was essential to identify the groups allegedly involved in order to suggest proper legal characterisations for the conduct in question. Consequently, information on the identity of the alleged perpetrators of some of the crimes listed does not appear in the report but is held in a confidential project database submitted to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. However, the identities of alleged perpetrators under warrant of arrest and those already sentenced for crimes listed in the report have been disclosed. Names have also been cited where political officials have assumed public positions encouraging or provoking the violations listed.Human Right Watch - DR Congo: Q & A on the United Nations Human Rights Mapping Report  Period covered  The report is presented chronologically, reflecting four key periods in the DRC's recent history: * March 1993‚ÄìJune 1996: The first period covers violations committed in the final years of the regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko and is marked by the failure of the democratisation process and the devastating consequences of the Rwandan genocide on the declining Zairian state, in particular in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu. During this period, 40 incidents were listed. * July 1996‚ÄìJuly 1998: The second period concerns violations committed during the First Congo War and the first year of the regime established by President Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila. This period has the greatest number of listed incidents (238) in the whole of the decade under examination. * August 1998‚ÄìJanuary 2000: The third period concerns the inventory of violations committed between the start of the Second Congo War in August 1998, and the death of President Kabila. This period includes 200 incidents and is characterised by the intervention on the territory of the DRC of the government armed forces of several countries. * January 2001‚ÄìJune 2003: The final period lists 139 incidents of violations committed in spite of the gradual establishment of a ceasefire along the front line and the speeding up of peace negotiations in preparation for the start of the transition period on 30 June 2003. (16-21)  Report recommendations  = Justice = The UN Mapping Report recommended the creation of a mixed judicial mechanism made up of national and international personnel as one of various transitional justice measures to be considered to address the numerous international crimes committed in the DRC. It did not make firm proposals on the national or international character of such mechanism, or its precise form or function.Amnesty USA: The Time for Justice is Now The operating methods and exact form of such a court ‚Äúshould be decided on and specified in detail by consulting the actors concerned, as well as the victims affected...‚Äù A mechanism of this kind should also ‚Äì among many other things ‚Äì apply international criminal law in relation to international crimes, including ‚Äúthe responsibility of superiors for the acts committed by their subordinates;‚Äù it should ‚Äúexclude the jurisdiction of the military courts in this area;‚Äù and should ‚Äúhave jurisdiction over anyone who has committed these crimes, whether they are nationals or non-nationals, civilians or military personnel.‚Äù (Paragraph 1052 / 1054) = Truth-seeking and reparations = Declaring that the Congolese people have a ‚Äúright to the truth on all the serious violations of human rights,‚Äù the report suggests the establishment of a new, non-judicial ‚Äútruth commission‚Äù that can help to determine institutional, political, military and other responsibilities; preserve evidence; identify the perpetrators of atrocities; recommend compensation measures and institutional reforms; and provide individual victims with a broader platform in which to air their grievances and concerns. (Paragraph 1057 / 1060-1061).Mapping Report: Transitional justice options Given the huge number of victims, the report says a comprehensive and creative approach to the issue of reparation is clearly required, and notes that the Congolese government should be the first to contribute. But it also points to the responsibilities of other countries involved in the conflict and notes that individuals and corporate entities such as multinationals which exploited the DRC's natural resources during the conflict could also be ordered to pay compensation if found criminally responsible. (Paragraph 1074-75) = Crime of genocide = The report notes, ‚Äúit is important that a full judicial investigation take place, in order to shed light on the reported incidents‚Äù in 1996-97. ‚ÄúOnly such an investigation and judicial determination would be in a position to resolve whether these incidents amount to the crime of genocide.‚Äù (Paragraph 522) The mapping report team noted that ‚ÄúThe question of whether the numerous serious acts of violence committed against the Hutus (refugees and others) constitute crimes of genocide has attracted a significant degree of comment and to date remains unresolved. The report repeatedly stresses that this question can ‚Äúonly be decided by a court decision on the basis of evidence beyond all reasonable doubt. However, \\"the apparent systematic and widespread attacks described in this report reveal a number of inculpatory elements that, if proven before a competent court, could be characterised as crimes of genocide.\\"The Telegraph: UN releases Congo genocide report Certain elements could cause a court to hesitate to decide on the existence of a genocidal plan, such as the fact that as of 15 November 1996, several tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees, many of whom had survived previous attacks, were repatriated to Rwanda with the help of the AFDL/APR authorities and that hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees were able to return to Rwanda with the consent of the Rwandan authorities prior to the start of the first war.Reuters: More Rwandan Hutu Refugees in Zaire Flown Home Whilst, in general, the killings did not spare women and children, in some places, at the beginning of the first war, Hutu women and children were in fact separated from the men, and only the men were subsequently killed.  Leaked draft report  An earlier draft of the report was leaked by French newspaper Le Monde on 27 August,Le Monde: L'acte d'accusation de dix ans de crimes au Congo RDC creating intense controversies as it reported that several Congolese rebel groups, Ugandan troops (along with Burundian, Angolan and other armed groups) had committed grave human rights violations. The most contentious aspect of the report referred to the possibility that the armed forces of Rwanda and their local allies may have committed acts, which could constitute crimes of genocide against ethnic Hutu civilians fleeing the country in fear of reprisal.DR Congo killings 'may be genocide' - UN draft report There was concern in the United NationsUN Upset by Premature Leak of DRC Report that Rwanda might end its participation in peacekeeping operations in reaction to the official release for the report.Ban urges Rwanda not to withdraw UN peacekeepers The authors of the report indicated that they were concerned that the language of ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù may be watered down before the official publishing of the document, therefore they felt it necessary to leak the report to safeguard the integrity of the report.  Report Key Findings  The apparently systematic nature of these violations suggests that the numerous deaths cannot be attributed to the hazards of both first and second congo wars or seen as equating to collateral damage.The Spiegel.de:Hell on Earth: The UN Documents Congo's Bloodbath The majority of the victims were children, women, elderly people and the sick, who posed no threat to the attacking forces. Numerous serious attacks on the physical or psychological integrity of members of the group were also committed, with a very high number of Hutus shot, raped, burnt or beaten.UNOHCHR: Mapping Report: War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity and Genocide Very large numbers of victims were forced to flee and travel long distances to escape their pursuers, who were trying to kill them. The hunt lasted for months, resulting in the deaths of an unknown number of people subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading living conditions, without access to food or medication. On several occasions, the humanitarian aid intended for them was deliberately blocked, in particular in Orientale Province, depriving them of assistance essential to their survival.Leaked UN report cites 'genocide' in DR Congo Here are some of the draft report's key findings:.UN DR Congo 'genocide' draft report - key excerpts Paragraph 512. The systematic attacks, in particular killings and massacres perpetrated against members of the Hutu ethnic group, are described extensively in section I of the report. These attacks resulted in a very large number of victims, probably tens of thousands of members of the Hutu ethnic group, all nationalities combined. In the vast majority of case reported, it was not a question of people killed unintentionally in the course of combat, but people targeted primarily by AFDL [Congolese rebels led by Laurent Kabila, who became president in 1997]/APR [Rwandan army]/FAB [Burundi's army] forces and executed in their hundreds, often with edged weapons. Paragraph 513. At the time of the incidents covered by this report, the Hutu population in Zaire, including refugees from Rwanda, constituted an ethnic group as defined in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Moreover, as shown previously, the intention to destroy a group in part is sufficient to be classified as a crime of genocide. Finally, the courts have also confirmed that the destruction of a group can be limited to a particular geographical area. It is therefore possible to assert that, even if only a part of the Hutu population in Zaire was targeted and destroyed, it could nonetheless constitute a crime of genocide, if this was the intention of the perpetrators. Finally, several incidents listed also seem to confirm that the numerous attacks were targeted at members of the Hutu ethnic group as such. Although, at certain times, the aggressors said they were looking for the criminals responsible for the genocide committed against the Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994, the majority of the incidents reported indicate that the Hutus were targeted as such, with no discrimination between them. The numerous attacks against the Hutus in Zaire, who were not part of the refugees, seem to confirm that it was all Hutus, as such, who were targeted. The crimes committed in particular in Rutshuru (30 October 1996) and Mugogo (18 November 1996), in North Kivu, highlight the specific targeting of the Hutus, since people who were able to persuade the aggressors that they belonged to another ethnic group were released just before the massacres. The systematic use of barriers by the AFDL/APR/FAB, particularly in South Kivu, enabled them to identify people of Hutu origin by their name or village of origin and thus to eliminate them. Hundreds of people of Hutu origin are thus thought to have been arrested at a barrier erected in November 1996 in Ngwenda, in the Rutshuru territory, and subsequently executed by being beaten with sticks in a place called Kabaraza. In South Kivu, AFDL/APR/FAB soldiers erected numerous barriers on the Ruzizi plain to stop Rwandan and Burundian refugees who had been dispersed after their camps had been dismantled. Paragraph 514: Several incidents listed in this report point to circumstances and facts from which a court could infer the intention to destroy the Hutu ethnic group in the DRC in part, if these were established beyond all reasonable doubt. Firstly, the scale of the crimes and the large number of victims are illustrated by the numerous incidents described above. The extensive use of edged weapons (primarily hammers) and the systematic massacre of survivors, including women and children, after the camps had been taken show that the numerous deaths cannot be attributed to the hazards of war or seen as equating to collateral damage. The systematic nature of the attacks listed against the Hutus also emerges: These attacks took place in each location where refugees had been identified by the AFDL/APR, over a vast area of the country. Particularly in North Kivu and South Kivu but also in other provinces, the massacres often began with a trick by elements of the AFDL/APR, who summoned the victims to meetings on the pretext either of discussing their repatriation to Rwanda in the case of the refugees, or of introducing them to the new authorities in the case of Hutus settled in the region, or of distributing food. Afterwards, those present were systematically killed. Cases of this kind were confirmed in the province of North Kivu in Musekera, Rutshuru and Kiringa (October 1996), Mugogo and Kabaraza (November 1996), Hombo, Katoyi, Kausa, Kifuruka, Kinigi, Musenge, Mutiko and Nyakariba (December 1996), Kibumba and Kabizo (April 1997) and Mushangwe (around August 1997); in the province of South Kivu in Rushima and Luberizi (October 1996), Cotonco and Chimanga (November 1996) and Mpwe (February 1997) and on the Shabunda-Kigulube road (February‚ÄìApril 1997); in Orientale Province in Kisangani and Bengamisa (May and June 1997); in Maniema in Kalima (March 1997) and in √âquateur in Boende (April 1997). Such acts certainly suggest premeditation and a precise methodology. In the region south of the town of Walikale, in North Kivu (January 1997), Rwandan Hutus were subjected to daily killings in areas already under the control of the AFDL/APR as part of a campaign that seemed to target any Hutus living in the area in question. Paragraph 515: Several of the massacres listed were committed regardless of the age or gender of the victims. This is particularly true of the crimes committed in Kibumba (October 1996), Mugunga and Osso (November 1996), Hombo and Biriko (December 1996) in the province of North Kivu, Kashusha and Shanje (November 1996) in the province of South Kivu, Tingi-Tingi and Lubutu (March 1997) in Maniema Province, and Boende (April 1997) in Equateur Province, where the vast majority of victims were women and children. Furthermore, no effort was made to make a distinction between Hutus who were members of the ex- FAR/Interahamwe [militia behind Rwanda's 1994 genocide] and Hutu civilians, whether or not they were refugees. This tendency to put all Hutus together and \\"tar them with the same brush\\" is also illustrated by the declarations made during the \\"awareness-raising speeches\\" made by the AFDL/APR in certain places, according to which any Hutu still present in Zaire must necessarily be a perpetrator of genocide, since the \\"real\\" refugees had already returned to Rwanda. These \\"awareness-raising speeches\\" made in North Kivu also incited the population to look for, kill or help to kill Rwandan Hutu refugees, whom they called \\"pigs\\". This type of language would have been in widespread use during the operations in this region. Paragraph 516: The massacres in Mbandaka and Wendji, committed on 13 May 1997 in √âquateur Province, over 2,000 kilometres west of Rwanda, were the final stage in the hunt for Hutu refugees that had begun in eastern Zaire, in North and South Kivu, in October 1996. Among the refugees were elements of the ex-FAR/Interahamwe, who were disarmed by the local police force as soon as they arrived. In spite of everything, the AFDL/APR opened fire on hundreds of defenceless Hutu refugees, resulting in large numbers of victims. Paragraph 517: The systematic and widespread attacks described in this report, which targeted very large numbers of Rwandan Hutu refugees and members of the Hutu civilian population, resulting in their death, reveal a number of damning elements that, if they were proven before a competent court, could be classified as crimes of genocide. The behaviour of certain elements of the AFDL/APR in respect of the Hutu refugees and Hutu populations settled in Zaire at this time seems to equate to \\"a manifest pattern of similar conduct directed against that group\\", from which a court could even deduce the existence of a genocidal plan. \\"Whilst the existence of such a plan may contribute to establishing the required genocidal intention, it is nonetheless only an element of proof used to deduce such an intention and not a legal element of genocide.\\" Paragraph 518. Nonetheless, neither the fact that only men were targeted during the massacres, nor the fact that part of the group were allowed to leave the country or that their movement was facilitated for various reasons, are sufficient in themselves to entirely remove the intention of certain people to partially destroy an ethnic group as such. In this respect it seems possible to infer a specific intention on the part of certain AFDL/APR commanders to partially destroy the Hutus in the DRC, and therefore to commit a crime of genocide, based on their conduct, words and the damning circumstances of the acts of violence committed by the men under their command. It will be for a court with proper jurisdiction to rule on this question. Conclusion Paragraph 1139. In light of the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and the repetition of crimes within the territory of the DRC, there is a manifest urgency for justice and security service reform. The members of the Mapping Team were able to observe the constant fear on the part of affected populations that history would repeat itself, especially when yesterday's attackers are returning in positions that enable them to commit new crimes with complete impunity.  Reactions  The Government of Rwanda stated that ‚ÄúThe Draft Mapping Report addresses only a fraction of a complex history, and ignores publicly available information that seriously undermines its findings. The reader is left with a onedsided account, and provided no context with which to understand who each of these Rwandan actors were, and how they found themselves in the Congolese forests from 1994 to 2003\\". The office of the government of Rwanda, in its press statement found that ‚ÄúIt is immoral and unacceptable that the United Nations, an organization that failed outright to prevent genocide in Rwanda and the subsequent refugees crisis, a direct cause for so much suffering in Congo and Rwanda, now accuses the army that stopped the genocide of committing atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is a fact that Rwanda‚Äôs intervention in the D.R.C. was a matter of survival and the direct consequence of the irresponsible and insensitive management of the refugee camps by the U.N. and the international community subsequent to the genocide.\\" Ugandan government rejected the report as a compendium of rumors deeply flawed in methodology, sourcing and standard of proof. \\"Its timing, scope, motive and subsequent leakage to the media were all made in bad taste.\\"  References   See also  * First Congo War * Second Congo War * Gersony Report * Great Lakes refugee crisis Category:Human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"DRC Mapping Exercise Report"},{"id":"33245966","text":"May Creek is a creek located in the Boundary Country of British Columbia.

Doggett was born in Jacksonville, Florida, earned a bachelor's degree at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida and his master's degree at Emory University. He received an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Florida in 1967 for his contributions toward the understanding of Stevens' work. Doggett wrote numerous essays and two books on Stevens, Stevens' Poetry of Thought and Wallace Stevens, The Making of the Poem. He co-edited Wallace Stevens: A Celebration with Robert Buttel of Temple University. Biography The son of a prominent Jacksonville attorney, Frank Doggett was the youngest of four children. A sister, Carita Doggett Corse, was a prominent Florida historian and the state's director of the Federal Writers' Project. The Doggett family residence is still located at 1548 Lancaster Terrace in Jacksonville's historic Riverside area. In his adolescence, Doggett developed a passion for literature and became aware of Stevens' poetry when he was a 21-year-old student. However, Doggett, a self-professed \\"goof-off\\" at that point in his life, did not seem likely to become a scholar. An unsuccessful student, first at Yale and then at the University of Florida, he transferred to Rollins College where he met and fell in love with poet and fellow student, Dorothy Emerson. A serious-minded person, Emerson initially would have little to do with him and told him he would have to settle down and study to win her attention. He did so and in 1933 they married, sharing a life devoted to literature for almost 60 years until her death in 1993. They had two children. After graduating from Rollins in 1931, Doggett went to New York with the aim of entering the publishing world. He soon discovered that his chances there were bleak due to the effects of the Great Depression. With the financial support of his father, Doggett attended Emory but then went back to Jacksonville and became an English teacher at Landon High School. He and his wife lived at the Jacksonville Beaches. As the communities there grew, construction of Duncan U. Fletcher High School began and when the school opened in 1937 Doggett became its principal. With the exception of a brief stint in the Navy during World War II, he served as its principal until 1964 when the school was divided and the original facility became a junior high. Doggett then became the first principal of the new senior high and remained in that position until two years before his retirement in 1971. He has been acknowledged in the community for sustaining a strong academic focus at the school and for inspiring students who subsequently continued their education at colleges throughout the country. Frank Doggett did not pursue his interest in literature or his career as a literary critic in the usual manner of scholars. As a high school principal, he was generally denied academic affiliations, yet he acquired scholarly recognition for his work. Helen Vendler, a Wallace Stevens scholar and professor of English at Boston and Harvard Universities, once stated that she was indebted to Doggett's work and felt that the barriers to pursuing a life of letters without an academic position would make doing so possible only for those with \\"great commitment and talent\\".Humanities Report, American Association for the Advancement of the Humanities. Vol. IV, No. 3 (March 1982) Doggett also collaborated with his wife, his literary ally as well as an unsparing critic of his works. Doggett maintained throughout his life that his writing was the \\"result of a continuing dialogue with her\\" and that literature was their principal topic of conversation. A number of her poems have been published in Poetry and The Yale Review; a collection of her poems, Eve's Primer, was published by the Wallace Stevens Society in 1991. The Beaches Leader/Ponte Vedra Leader. Jacksonville Beach, Florida. (September 4, 2002) Frank Doggett was also an accomplished fisherman, and held several light-tackle world records during his life.

It was created in 2009 by the Offices for Science and University of the Consulate-general of France in Shanghai, in partnership with the French Academy of Sciences. The Portal, was inaugurated on May, 21st of 2010, at the French pavilion of the Shanghai Expo 2010. The portal is available at www.aurore-sciences.org.  Presentation  Aurore is an exchange platform created to bring together scientific research stakeholders. It is also an interactive database for Sino-French cooperation in research and higher education. The Portal has been developed by the Offices for Science and University of the Consulate-general of the Republic of France in Shanghai, in partnership with the French Academy of Sciences. It covers the fields of sciences, technology, social sciences, and humanities. The portal is available without cost and allows all the stakeholders involved in scientific research to register, identify appropriate partners, and set up cooperative activities. Aurore‚Äôs aim is to gather information on the cooperative activities of stakeholders, institutions, programs and research projects in France and China, in the field of science and technology. The platform also encourages the researchers to make contact and gather into thematic working groups or communities of practise. In the long term, Aurore aspires to become the display window of research and scientific cooperation between China and France. Numerous researchers, belonging to the highest institutions and schools in France (CNRS, Inserm, Acad√©mie des Sciences, Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Mines, Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers, Paristech, INRIA, Institut Pasteur, IRD, INRA...) have already joined the platform.  Goals  The platform, which covers the fields of sciences, technologies, social sciences and humanities, has three main functions. Information Aurore allows the identification of appropriate partners and the setting up of new cooperative activities, thanks to the network of research and teaching institutions in France and China. The Portal also gathers information on cooperative projects, participating institutions and researchers. Finally, Aurore provides a lot of useful information such as calendars of scientific events, calls for proposal announcements and availability of scholarships. Communication Aurore aims to improve exchanges between French and Chinese researchers by publishing news about research and cooperation. The portal is also a true community network that is sustained by its members‚Äô contribution. Cooperation Aurore helps initiate contacts, animate research groups, and communicate more actively on projects. This platform aims to encourage researchers to build contacts and create thematic working groups.  Interface  Aurore is a Sino- French bilingual portal, that gathers the following subsections: News This new tab gathers news about Sino-French research, in order to highlight the current cooperative activity. It is made up of four sections. The Agenda section provides information about events related to scientific news ; the Channel section presents profiles of famous figures in scientific research. The News section refers to scientific articles published by institutions and research organizations. Finally, the members‚Äô papers section refers to the database of all the articles published by members. Members This tab provides an inventory of all the members registered on the platform, and allows users to have access to their respective profiles including membername, research field and specialty, institution, and contact informations. 'Establishments' This tab presents the registered institutions (address, detailed structure, fields of excellence, etc.). The establishments are registered according to two criteria: geography (national and local origin), and type (university, research institute, hospital). Cooperations This tab describes the cooperative projects, and the associated members and institutions. Groups This tab facilitates exchanges between scientific communities by creating and animating working groups and discussion groups. It truly illustrates the forum function of the portal.  Stakeholders  The platform involves different stakeholders from the world of research. \\\\- The platform will allow researchers to identify partners from their respective research fields, access clear and organized information about research networks and French and Chinese research institutions. The platform will provide scientific news ; \\\\- Universities, centres, laboratories and research institutions will gain visibility, for their projects as well as for their institutional organisation ; \\\\- administrative and consular services linked to higher education and research : they have access to the complete data, and broadcast notifications and targeted information for French and Chinese scientific communities ; \\\\- central administration (Ministries, Acad√©mie of sciences, etc.) can get a broad vision of global cooperation and knowledge of stakeholders, institutions and programs.

The site was researched by the Galician archaeologist Juan Cabr√© in 1920s. It is namesake for two different archaeological cultures known from this site: Cogotas I (pre-Celtic) of the Late Bronze Age and Cogotas II (most probably Celtic) of the Iron Age. The latter is known from the upper layer of Las Cogotas, which represents a classical settlement of Vettones, which inhabited the territory of modern provinces of Avila and Salamanca, as well as parts of Toledo, Zamora, Caseres and Tras-os-Montes in Portugal.  Protocogotas culture  This stage of the Meseta history is the least known, although a series of archeological sites, such as Los Tolmos de Caracena in Soria, Cogeces del Monte in Valladolid, Abia de la Obispalia in Cuenca, and some others, allow to describe Protocogotas culture as a formation stage of Cogotas I culture. This culture, which existed around 1700‚Äî1550 BC, is also known as Cogeces horizon, and is based on the Bell Beaker substrate influenced by either El Argar or Atlantic Bronze. Although Protocogotas culture was not represented by finds in La Cogotas, it did have characteristic traits later displayed in Cogotas I.  Cogotas I  Characteristic for this culture is black pottery with incised geometric motives incrusted by white paste (:es:Cer√°mica de Boquique). Vessels were relatively small, flat-based, conic, rough, supposedly used as kitchen ware. Chronology of Cogotas I: * Formation stage, 1700 BC (Protocogotas) * incised and Boquique ceramics, 1550 BC. * trade networks, 1350 BC. * expansion of the culture, 1100 BC. * disappearance, 1000 BC.  Cogotas II  In the early 1st millennium BC the Iberic peninsula was invaded by the Celts and other Indo-European tribes, which occupied the central and western parts of the peninsula and created new cultures on the ruins of the older ones. One of them were Vettones, most probably of Celtic origin. Characteristic for Cogotas II cultures are verraco statues. These are stone bovine statues situated on pasture lands, whose exact usage is still unclear. Among other material culture objects there were daggers, flat axes, copper alloy axes, sickles, granite grindstones, spindle whorls etc. Like other similar settlements, Cogotas of that time was divided into several functional districts, including several cattle enclosures and a necropolis. Cattle husbandry played an important role in the life of Vettones, which was probably reflected in their zoomorphic verraco statues.  Literature * Historia de Castilla y Le√≥n. 1.

Reconstruction refers to the ability of the researcher to predict what sensory stimuli the subject is receiving based purely on neuron action potentials. Therefore, the main goal of neural decoding is to characterize how the electrical activity of neurons elicit activity and responses in the brain. This article specifically refers to neural decoding as it pertains to the mammalian neocortex.  Overview  When looking at a picture, people's brains are constantly making decisions about what object they are looking at, where they need to move their eyes next, and what they find to be the most salient aspects of the input stimulus. As these images hit the back of the retina, these stimuli are converted from varying wavelengths to a series of neural spikes called action potentials. These pattern of action potentials are different for different objects and different colors; we therefore say that the neurons are encoding objects and colors by varying their spike rates or temporal pattern. Now, if someone were to probe the brain by placing electrodes in the primary visual cortex, they may find what appears to be random electrical activity. These neurons are actually firing in response to the lower level features of visual input, possibly the edges of a picture frame. This highlights the crux of the neural decoding hypothesis: that it is possible to reconstruct a stimulus from the response of the ensemble of neurons that represent it. In other words, it is possible to look at spike train data and say that the person or animal being recorded is looking at a red ball. With the recent breakthrough in large-scale neural recording and decoding technologies, researchers have begun to crack the neural code and already provided the first glimpse into the real-time neural code of memory traces as memory is formed and recalled in the hippocampus, a brain region known to be central for memory formation. Neuroscientists have initiated large-scale brain activity mapping or brain decoding projectThe Brain Decoding Project. http://braindecodingproject.org/ to construct the brain-wide neural codes.  Encoding to decoding  Implicit about the decoding hypothesis is the assumption that neural spiking in the brain somehow represents stimuli in the external world. The decoding of neural data would be impossible if the neurons were firing randomly: nothing would be represented. This process of decoding neural data forms a loop with neural encoding. First, the organism must be able to perceive a set of stimuli in the world ‚Äì say a picture of a hat. Seeing the stimuli must result in some internal learning: the encoding stage. After varying the range of stimuli that is presented to the observer, we expect the neurons to adapt to the statistical properties of the signals, encoding those that occur most frequently:Barlow, H. (1961). Possible principles underlying the transformation of sensory messages. Sensory communication. the efficient-coding hypothesis. Now neural decoding is the process of taking these statistical consistencies, a statistical model of the world, and reproducing the stimuli. This may map to the process of thinking and acting, which in turn guide what stimuli we receive, and thus, completing the loop. In order to build a model of neural spike data, one must both understand how information is originally stored in the brain and how this information is used at a later point in time. This neural coding and decoding loop is a symbiotic relationship and the crux of the brain's learning algorithm. Furthermore, the processes that underlie neural decoding and encoding are very tightly coupled and may lead to varying levels of representative ability.  Spatial resolutions  Much of the neural decoding problem depends on the spatial resolution of the data being collected. The number of neurons needed to reconstruct the stimulus with reasonable accuracy depends on the means by which data is collected and the area being recorded. For example, rods and cones (which respond to colors of small visual areas) in the retina may require more recordings than simple cells (which respond to orientation of lines) in the primary visual cortex. Previous recording methods relied on stimulating single neurons over a repeated series of tests in order to generalize this neuron's behavior. New techniques such as high-density multi-electrode array recordings and multi-photon calcium imaging techniques now make it possible to record from upwards of a few hundred neurons. Even with better recording techniques, the focus of these recordings must be on an area of the brain that is both manageable and qualitatively understood. Many studies look at spike train data gathered from the ganglion cells in the retina, since this area has the benefits of being strictly feedforward, retinotopic, and amenable to current recording granularities. The duration, intensity, and location of the stimulus can be controlled to sample, for example, a particular subset of ganglion cells within a structure of the visual system. Other studies use spike trains to evaluate the discriminatory ability of non-visual senses such as rat facial whiskers and the olfactory coding of moth pheromone receptor neurons. Even with ever-improving recording techniques, one will always run into the limited sampling problem: given a limited number of recording trials, it is impossible to completely account for the error associated with noisy data obtained from stochastically functioning neurons (for example, a neuron's electric potential fluctuates around its resting potential due to a constant influx and efflux of sodium and potassium ions). Therefore, it is not possible to perfectly reconstruct a stimulus from spike data. Luckily, even with noisy data, the stimulus can still be reconstructed within acceptable error bounds.  Temporal resolutions  Timescales and frequencies of stimuli being presented to the observer are also of importance to decoding the neural code. Quicker timescales and higher frequencies demand faster and more precise responses in neural spike data. In humans, millisecond precision has been observed throughout the visual cortex, the retina, and the lateral geniculate nucleus, so one would suspect this to be the appropriate measuring frequency. This has been confirmed in studies that quantify the responses of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus to white-noise and naturalistic movie stimuli. At the cellular level, spike- timing-dependent plasticity operates at millisecond timescales; therefore, models seeking biological relevance should be able to perform at these temporal scales.  Probabilistic decoding  When decoding neural data, arrival times of each spike t_1,\\\\text{ }t_2,\\\\text{ }...,\\\\text{ }t_n\\\\text{ }=\\\\text{ }\\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\\\\\}, and the probability of seeing a certain stimulus, P[s(t)] may be the extent of the available data. The prior distribution P[s(t)] defines an ensemble of signals, and represents the likelihood of seeing a stimulus in the world based on previous experience. The spike times may also be drawn from a distribution P[\\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\\\\\}]; however, what we want to know is the probability distribution over a set of stimuli given a series of spike trains P[s(t)\\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\\\\\}], which is called the response-conditional ensemble. What remains is the characterization of the neural code by translating stimuli into spikes, P[\\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\\\\\}s(t)]; the traditional approach to calculating this probability distribution has been to fix the stimulus and examine the responses of the neuron. Combining everything using Bayes' Rule results in the simplified probabilistic characterization of neural decoding: P[ s(t)  \\\\\\\\{ t_i \\\\\\\\} ] = P[ \\\\\\\\{ t_i \\\\\\\\}  s(t) ] * (P[s(t)]/P[\\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\\\\\}] ). An area of active research consists of finding better ways of representing and determining P[ \\\\\\\\{ t_i \\\\\\\\}  s(t) ].Rieke, F. (1999). Spikes: exploring the neural code. exploring the neural code (p. 395). The MIT Press. The following are some such examples. = Spike train number = The simplest coding strategy is the spike train number coding. This method assumes that the spike number is the most important quantification of spike train data. In spike train number coding, each stimulus is represented by a unique firing rate across the sampled neurons. The color red may be signified by 5 total spikes across the entire set of neurons, while the color green may be 10 spikes; each spike is pooled together into an overall count. This is represented by: P(rs) = \\\\prod_{} P(n_{ij}  s) where r = n = the number of spikes, n_{ij} is the number of spikes of neuron i at stimulus presentation time j, and s is the stimulus. = Instantaneous rate code = Adding a small temporal component results in the spike timing coding strategy. Here, the main quantity measured is the number of spikes that occur within a predefined window of time T. This method adds another dimension to the previous. This timing code is given by: P(/Sr.)=2 we index hr eg where t_{ijl} is the jth spike on the lth presentation of neuron i, v_i(ts) is the firing rate of neuron i at time t, and 0 to T is the start to stop times of each trial. = Temporal correlation = Temporal correlation code, as the name states, adds correlations between individual spikes. This means that the time between a spike t_i and its preceding spike t_{i-1} is included. This is given by: P(rs) = \\\\prod_{l} \\\\left [ \\\\prod_{i,j} v_i ( t_{ijl},\\\\tau(t_{ijl})  s)dt \\\\right ] exp \\\\left [ -\\\\sum_{i} \\\\int_{0}^{T} dtv_i(t, \\\\tau(t)  s) \\\\right ] where \\\\tau(t) is the time interval between a neurons spike and the one preceding it. = Ising decoder = Another description of neural spike train data uses the Ising model borrowed from the physics of magnetic spins. Because neural spike trains are effectively binarized (either on or off) at small time scales (10 to 20 ms), the Ising model is able to effectively capture the present pairwise correlations, and is given by: P(rs) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Zeta(s)} exp \\\\left ( \\\\sum_{i} h_i(s)r_i + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i e j} J_{ij}(s)r_ir_j \\\\right ) where r = (r_1, r_2, . . . , r_n )^T is the set of binary responses of neuron i, h_i is the external fields function, J_{ij} is the pairwise couplings function, and \\\\Zeta(s) is the partition function  Agent-based decoding  In addition to the probabilistic approach, agent-based models exist that capture the spatial dynamics of the neural system under scrutiny. One such model is hierarchical temporal memory, which is a machine learning framework that organizes visual perception problem into a hierarchy of interacting nodes (neurons). The connections between nodes on the same levels and a lower levels are termed synapses, and their interactions are subsequently learning. Synapse strengths modulate learning and are altered based on the temporal and spatial firing of nodes in response to input patterns.Hawkins, J., Ahmad, S., & Dubinsky, D. (2006). Hierarchical temporal memory: Concepts, theory and terminology. Whitepaper.Hawkins, J., & Blakeslee, S. (2005). On intelligence. Owl Books. While it is possible to take the firing rates of these modeled neurons, and transform them into the probabilistic and mathematical frameworks described above, agent-based models provide the ability to observe the behavior of the entire population of modeled neurons. Researchers can circumvent the limitations implicit with lab-based recording techniques. Because this approach does rely on modeling biological systems, error arises in the assumptions made by the researcher and in the data used in parameter estimation.  Applicability  The advancement in our understanding of neural decoding benefits the development of brain-machine interfaces, prosthetics and the understanding of neurological disorders such as epilepsy.

The law, written in large part by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, and cosponsored by Alabama Representative Micky Hammon and Alabama State Senator Scott Beason, was passed by the Alabama House of Representatives and Alabama Senate with widespread legislative support. It was then signed into law on June 9, 2011, by Governor Robert J. Bentley. Provisions The Alabama law requires that if police have \\"reasonable suspicion\\" that a person is an immigrant unlawfully present in the United States, in the midst of any legal stop, detention or arrest, to make a similarly reasonable attempt to determine that person's legal status. An exemption is provided if such action would hinder an official investigation of some kind. The law prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving any public benefits at either the state or local level. It bans illegal immigrants from attending publicly owned colleges or universities (currently blocked). At the high, middle, and elementary public school levels, the law requires that school officials ascertain whether students are illegal immigrants. Attendance is not prohibited for such students; school districts are mandated to submit annual tallies on the suspected number of illegal immigrants when making report to state education officials. The law prohibits the transporting or harboring of illegal immigrants (currently blocked). It prohibits landlords from renting property to illegal immigrants. It forbids employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants for any job within Alabama. Moreover, it considers as a discriminatory practice any action to refuse to employ or remove a legal resident of the state when an illegal one is already employed (currently blocked). The law requires large and small businesses to validate the immigration status of employees using the US E-Verify program. The law prohibits illegal immigrants from applying for work. (currently blocked) The production of false identification documents is considered a crime. Contracts formed in which one party is an illegal immigrant and the other has direct knowledge of that are deemed null and void. The law also requires voters to provide proof of citizenship when registering. Legal challenges to the law The law was originally scheduled to take effect on September 1, 2011, but legal actions were taken against it by the Obama administration, some religious groups, student groups (Spanish and Latino Student Alliance), and some immigrant-rights groups, all making claims that the law was unconstitutional. On August 29, 2011, U.S. Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn, sitting for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, temporarily blocked enforcement of the law, saying she needed more time to study the case. On September 28, 2011, Judge Blackburn gave the green light to key parts of the law. Less than a month after the bill was signed into law, the Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama (HICA) filed the case Hispanic Interest Coalition of Alabama v. Bentley challenging HB 56 on the grounds that various provisions of the act, and the entire law as a whole, are preempted by federal law, and are therefore illegal. HICA was only the first to file such a claim, followed by the United States Department of Justice with the suit United States v. Alabama and a group of Alabama Church Leaders with Parsley v. Bentley. After the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of groups including the ACLU appealed that ruling, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on October 14, 2011, again put several key provisions on hold until the issues of constitutionality could be addressed, including the requirement on schools to collect information on enrolling students' immigration status. Other provisions, such as those making contracts with undocumented aliens null and void, were left to stand. U.S. Judge Myron Herbert Thompson, sitting for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, blocked an additional portion of the law on November 23, 2011, that prevented undocumented immigrants from obtaining certain mobile home registrations. In a further December 12, 2011, ruling, Thompson attacked the history behind the law, describing the legislative debate as having been \\"laced with derogatory comments about Hispanics.\\" He said it was likely that the entire law was \\"discriminatorily based\\" and that lawmakers employed ethnic stereotypes and used the terms \\"Hispanic\\" and \\"illegal immigrant\\" interchangeably. He accused State Representative Hammon of having misused a news article to justify a claim that Alabama was home to the second fastest growing population of undocumented immigrants in the nation. Impact Once the federal ruling of September 29, 2011 upholding most of the law went into effect, several Alabama school districts reported a significant drop in the number of Hispanic children attending public schools. State and local officials urged immigrants to keep their children in the schools, saying the law does not bar them from attending. Industries dependent on migrant labor have been strongly impacted. Farmers have found that Americans are not willing to work under such harsh working conditions for low pay. Some businesses in other industries have lost workers, including legal workers, as a result of the new immigration law.Roy L. Williams (October 12, 2011). \\"Alabama restaurant owners say some legal Hispanic workers are leaving as a result of the new immigration law\\". The Birmingham News. On November 18, 2011, a German Mercedes-Benz executive was arrested for not having proper documentation on him while on business in Alabama, having left his passport at the hotel where he was staying and carrying only his German identity card. On December 2, 2011, a Japanese Honda executive was stopped in Leeds, Alabama, at a checkpoint set up by police to catch unlicensed drivers. He was ticketed on the spot, despite the fact that he showed an International Driving Permit, a valid passport and a U.S. work permit. On December 18, 2011, it was reported that Alabama's unemployment rate had fallen from 9.2 percent to 8.7 percent. Ahmad Ijaz, Director of Economic Forecasting at the University of Alabama, found that the majority of job growth in 2011 was in the automotive sector ‚Äì an area of the economy where undocumented workers were uncommon. Ijaz attributed a rise in employment to the retail growth during holiday sales. Contrary to expectation, there was no job growth in sectors where Latinos typically work ‚Äì construction, agriculture, and poultry processing. In 2012, a study by Dr. Samuel Addy of the University of Alabama estimated that HB56 could shrink the state's annual GDP by $11 billion or almost 6%, a result of lost sales and income taxes and fall in demand from lost consumers. One study found that \\"Alabama HB 56 contributed to an increase in violent crime rates, while there was no significant change in property crime rates after the act.\\" Calls for revisions On December 5, 2011, Attorney General of Alabama Luther Strange recommended repealing several parts of the law: the provision requiring collection of the immigration status of public school students, the provision requiring immigrants to always carry alien registration cards, and the allowance of lawsuits by state citizens who do not believe public officials are enforcing the law.

He previously served as a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives from District 62 (which includes Delta, Fannin, and Grayson counties). Biography Phillips received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Baylor University in Waco. He received his Juris Doctor from the University of Houston Law Center. Phillips initially won his seat in the state House in 2003 in a special runoff election with nearly 66 percent of the vote; his defeated opponent was the Democrat Donnie Jarvis. The vacancy appeared when U.S. President George W. Bush appointed Republican State Representative Ronald H. Clark of Sherman as a judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, based in the branch court at Beaumont in southeastern Texas. Clark had held the state House seat since 1997. Phillips served as the chairman of the House Transportation Committee and was a member of the committees on Ethics, Redistricting, and Border and Intergovernmental Affairs. Phillips secured his latest full term in 2010 with nearly 88 percent of the ballots cast over the Libertarian Kenneth Myers. No Democrat sought the seat. Phillips was also a member of numerous committees: 82nd Legislature * Border & Intergovernmental Affairs * General Investigating & Ethics * Oversight of Criminal Justice * Redistricting * Transportation (Chair) 81st Legislature * Culture, Recreation & Tourism * General Investigating & Ethics (Vice Chair) * Oversight of Criminal Justice * Transportation (Vice Chair) * Transportation Funding, Select (Chair) 80th Legislature * Culture, Recreation, & Tourism * General Investigating & Ethics (Chair) * Intermediate Care Facility Services, Select (Chair) * Operation & Management of the Texas Youth Commission * Private Participation in Toll Projects * Transportation (Vice Chair) 79th Legislature * Culture, Recreation, & Tourism * Election Contests, Select * Transportation (Vice Chair) 78th Legislature * Construction-Related Workers' Comp, Select * Election Contests, Select * State Cultural and Recreational Resources * Transportation (Vice Chair)  Texas House Ethics Panel  In November 2010, State Representative Bryan Hughes withdrew his support for a second term for moderate Republican Joe Straus of San Antonio as Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. Hughes charged that Straus was punishing intraparty conservative opponents with unfair redistricting. Hughes based his claim on a conversation with one of Straus' staffers. Hughes said that he was told two East Texas members were being especially earmarked through redistricting, then Representative-elect Erwin Cain of Sulphur Springs and Dan Flynn of Van. Representative Chuck Hopson of Jacksonville, a Democrat- turned-Republican and chairman of the House Ethics Committee, called upon Hughes to reveal the name of the informant. Under oath at his own request, Hughes identified the informant as Representative Phillips. Before the Ethics Committee, Phillips removed himself as a member for the duration of the hearing and denied Hughes's accusation. The phone conversation between Hughes and Phillips was not recorded. The committee did not reach a judgment because of the lack of corroborating witnesses. While in the legislature, he was the only Republican state lawmakers to support the Texas Sunset Commission, and he argued for the enhancement of toll roads.

Achievements Shen used to be one of the richest men at the area of south of the Yangtze river by doing foreign commerce and he took the most advantage of the convenient waterway in Suzhou. After he became rich, he made Suzhou as the important place to do his business. Shen lived in the period of the end of Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of Ming Dynasty. At the beginning of Ming Dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor chose Nanjing as the capital. Shen helped to build one third of the wall of the capital. Experience Zhouzhuang. Shen had been to Zhouzhuang, Suzhou, Nanjing, Yunnan and many other places. Shen always considered Zhouzhuang as the place where his career started. \\"The residence of Shen is in the north-west of the town which has storehouse,garden and pavilion along the Yinze river\\"Âë®Â∫ÑÈïáÂøó \\"the magnificent house of Shen is still in Zhouzhuang\\"ËãèË∞à But the Hongwu Emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang, was envy of his property and concerned about the threat posed by this fabulously wealthy man. Shen was finally exiled to Yunnan and spent the rest of his lifetime there. The people liked Shen very much and they preferred to believe that Shen would never die and became an immortal. In the Qing Dynasty, someone still claimed that he met ageless Shen in Yunnan. This can show that Shen was beloved by people deeply. How Shen made a fortune Xuanwu lake. He started his career with farming in Zhouzhuang. Zhouzhuang has the warm climate and easy irrigation which is suitable for farming. Shen followed his father to here and made money through agriculture. \\"Shen liked buying land and houses to grow wealth.\\"Âê¥È£éÂΩï There was a rich man called Lu Deyuan in Suzhou. He appreciated the talents of Shen and trusted him. He passed large amounts of money to Shen. With the help of Lu, Shen had more ability to create more money. \\"Shen Wansan has the fortune passed by a man named Lu, who was one of the richest men in this area.\\"Âë®Â∫ÑÈïáÂøó Shen developed the farming, as well as silk and tea business. As water transport was quite convenient in Zhouzhuang, he exported tea, silk, china and food and imported jewels, ivory items, and spices. In this way, he accumulated great wealth. The story goes that Shen had a treasure trove so great that it could not be counted. He helped to build the walls of Nanjing and other facilities with this limitless money. It is said that the very large Xuanwu Lake formed his rear garden. Ancient Tea Route Men Laden With Tea, Sichuan Sheng, China; Ernest H. Wilson (1908). After he was exiled to Yunnan, many of Shen's friends went to visit him. They found a new route to earn money: they could transport tea, china, handcrafts and so on to the North-western area and Tibet. The route is now called Ancient tea route. Although the weather there was chilly and the passes were rough and rugged, Shen thought it had potential to be developed. With his rich experience and commercial initiative, he transported the typical products from South of the River to Tibet, India, Burma and other places. Historic evaluation Among all the historic events, the story of Zhu Yuanzhang and Shen Wansan is the only one which is about the battle between a great politician and a great businessman. The imperial power above everything won the battle inevitably.

The initiative was launched in 2008. In Hindi, Jagriti Yatra means a journey of awakening, and as the name suggests it is a journey of social awakening. Youngsters, between the age group of 20 and 27, from India and overseas can apply to go on the yatra. The journey is for 15 days in which, a distance of 8000 kilometers is covered,They visit 15 Role Models at 12 destination covering The Indian States of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan and Gujarat in a train that transports only the yatris or travelers of the Jagriti Yatra. The individuals who go for the journey are supposed to live in the train for the span of 15‚Äì18 days and interact with their fellow travelers. The Tatas were associated with the programme during 2008-2010. The Jagriti Yatra has the aim of exposing the Indian Youth to the concept of social entrepreneurship and social progress through enterprise led development. Introduction Jagriti Yatra is an annual train journey that takes highly motivated young Indians and a few young people from outside India between the ages of 20 and 27, on a 15- or 18-day national odyssey. A specially hired 18 wagon train takes 450 young men and women (a few of them are student entrepreneurs, a few more are rural entrepreneurs) competitively selected out of a pool of about 40,000 applications, to meet with and learn from exceptional entrepreneurs who are developing innovative solutions to India's challenges. Many of them are unsung heroes, and the Yatra encourages the young to unleash the hero within them. The participants are divided into cohort/subgroup of 6 participants and 1 facilitator. Three such cohorts formed a group. It has been executed successfully for the past three years in a row, and has established itself as a calendar national event that is a 'must go' for the young people. Through its activities that go on during the entire year, the participants get to participate in the community, and the programs that follow the Yatra including BizGyan Tree, which is a rural incubation camp and Jagriti Conclave, which is a gathering of entrepreneurs and Yatra alumni in a relatively smaller location around a suitable occasion such as the Independence Day of India. Jagriti Yatra is slowly developing into an eco-system to further the movement of enterprise-led-development among the youth in India. The overall aim is to awaken the spirit of entrepreneurship - both social and economic, in India's youth by exposing them to individuals and institutions that are developing unique solutions to India's challenges. Jagriti Yatra is known to claim that they will inspire young people to lead and develop institutions nationally (or internationally) and within their communities, and solve problems using their own enterprises. Currently, the alumni body of the Yatra is organized across the nation. The number of alumni has crossed 2000, and is likely to grow by 400 every year. CA Raj Deshmukh is one of the first yatri from Pune, who completed 2008 Jagriti Yatra. Enterprise Led Development Enterprise led development is the process of creating enterprises that will eventually lead to social and economic development through generation of employment and inculcation of a sense of economic security. In this context, the yatra about sensitizing the youth to the socio-economic problem faced by the rural areas of India in order to assure a certain level awareness in them about the entrepreneurial opportunities in these areas. The creation of an inclination in the youth towards the concept of enterprise led development is one of the goals of the programme. The Chairman of Jagriti Sewa Santhan, Shashank Mani, in an article about the yatra, said, \\"Enterprise Led Development, or Udyam Janit Vikas, seeks to change the development paradigm from one of dependence to that of taking charge. It seeks to shift the mindset of young India from job seekers to job creators. It seeks to shift the role of government from that of a captain to one of the coach and a catalyst.\\" The process of enterprise led development creates scalable improvements in the society and this is through training the most important factor, which is the human capital, and for this the potential entrepreneurs should be intuitive and should have the technique of assessing the opportunities. Many individuals who have not travelled away from home get an opportunity to meet successful entrepreneurs who have made a difference in their societies and the inspiration that they receive in the process is what they take back at the end of the journey. For example, an individual from Uttar Pradesh gets a chance to see the Amul Factory in Gujarat during the journey, and he is inspired to start an economically viable enterprise in his hometown. The foundation for such initiatives is laid down during the process and the travelers or the yatri are expected to build on it through their own interest, perseverance and vision. Jagriti Sewa Sansthan The Jagriti Sewa Sansthan was founded in 1985 with the main objective of societal development, based in Deoria. The NGO focuses on participatory development and works mainly towards skill development. It believes that entrepreneurship and skill development go hand- in-hand. The main objective Jagrithi Sewa Sansthan are *To strengthen local self-governance and build leadership in panchayati raj institutions. *To enhance the capacities of traditional village leaders, youth and women so that they can actively participate in the process of development through their own enterprises. *To increase the participation of women at both the organisational and community level, by creating a gender-sensitive environment and mainstreaming gender in every stage of the programme‚Äôs implementation. By pursuing the above-mentioned objectives, the organization has promoted many activities including community mobilization, working for forest and water- related issues, training men and women for dealing with daily livelihood concerns and training panchayat members to integrate with the local men and women in their activities. The yatra was an idea initially planned by the Jagriti Sewa Sansthan team in 1997, called Azad Bharat Rail Yatra. It was a journey embarking the 50th year of Independent India. This was the first step towards materializing the idea of inspiring the youth towards enterprise led development of rural India. In 2007, Swapnil Dixit, then a recent graduate from IIT Kharagpur, added fresh energy into the whole initiative and led Jagriti Yatra as the Executive director until 2012. Under his leadership, the yatra took its current form and became a recurring annual event.

It was devised by Robert Slavin and his associates at Johns Hopkins University. STAD is considered as one of the most researched, simplest and straightforward of all the cooperative learning. It was established based on the fulfillment of instructional pedagogy. It is used in meeting well-defined instructional objectives. It is a learning strategy in which there are small group of learners with different levels of abilities, wherein they all come together to accomplish a shared learning goal.student/team/achievement-division Working of STAD The students are placed in small groups or teams. The class in its entirety is presented with a lesson and students are subsequently tested. Individuals are graded on the team's performance . Although the tests are taken individually, students are encouraged to work together to improve the overall performance of the group. It is basically a team work, but students are graded individually according to their contribution that they make towards their team. Usually in STAD students are assigned 4 to 5 members in a group that are mixed in performance level, gender and ethnicity. The teacher teaches a lesson to the students and they then work in teams and ensure that they have mastered the lesson. The students take individual quizzes on the material, at which they may not help each other. Their scores are compared to their own past averages and points are awarded on the basis of the degree to which students meet or exceed their own earlier performance. It encourages the students to take up responsibility for other members in their group as well as themselves. Thus in this way it is guaranteed that all group members with different levels are equally motivated to do their best. Slavin (1995) enumerated three main concepts of STAD as team rewards, individual accountability and for equal opportunities for success . Team rewards are certificates or either rewards which are given if a STAD group achieves higher than predetermined level . In this way a spirit of positive competition is reinforced and all or none of the groups would be rewarded based on how they score. In terms of individual accountability, the individual learning of each of the group members determines the success of the terms. STAD has been used in a wide variety of subjects from mathematics to language, arts to social science and used from 2nd grade in schools through college. It is the most appropriate for teaching well defined objectives by incorporating more open-ended assessments, such as essays or performance.http://www.innovativelearning.com/educational.../cooperative- learning.doc In STAD, students are assigned to 4 or 5-member heterogeneous groups. Once these assignments are made, a four-step cycle is initiated: (i) teach, (ii) team study, (iii) test and (iv) recognition. = Teach = In the teaching stage, the teacher presents materials usually in a lecture-discussion format. Students should be told what it is they are going to learn and why it is important. = Team study = In the team study stage, group members work cooperatively with teacher-provided worksheets and answer sheets. = Test = In the testing stage, each student individually takes a quiz. The teacher grades the quiz and notes the current scores as well as the improvement over previous quizzes. = Recognition = Each team receives recognition awards depending on the average scores of each team. For example, teams that average 15 to 19 improvement points receive a GOOD TEAM certificate, teams that average 20 to 24 improvement points receive a GREAT TEAM certificate, and teams that average 25 to 30 improvement points receive a SUPER TEAM certificate. Components of STAD * Class presentation * Teams * Quizzes * Individual improvement score * Team recognition =Advantages= * Group has greater information resources than individuals do * Group has to employ a greater number of creative problem-solving methods * Group members gain a better understanding of themselves as they interact with each other. * Working in a group foster learning and comprehension of idea discussed. =Disadvantages= * An individual group member may dominate the discussion. * Some group members may rely too much on others to get the job done. * Group members may pressure others to conform to the majority opinion.

There is little overlap between successive generations.Boyle, P.R., Rodhouse, P.G. (2005) Cephalopods: ecology and fisheries Wiley-Blackwell. . The supply of octopus has been constrained by overfishing in many key fisheries.FAO (2010) The State of the World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2010. FAO, Rome. Page 41. The common octopus seems particularly suitable for aquaculture. However, it is currently difficult to culture the early life stages of octopus and maintain high survival rates for their paralarvae. This difficulty is limiting the development of fully closed life cycle octopus hatchery systems.  Species  Graph showing the decline in the global capture production (in tonnes) of the common octopus over recent years (source FAOOctopus vulgaris FAO: Species Fact Sheets, Rome.)

The common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, appears to be the most serious candidate for aquaculture in terms of its biological and market potential. It has a worldwide distribution in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters. It is a benthic species occurring from the coastal line to the outer edge of the continental shelf, at depths to 200 m and in very diverse marine habitats.Guerra, A. (1992) \\"Mollusca: Cephalopoda\\" In: Ramos, M.A., et al. (Eds.) Fauna Iberica, vol. 1. Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, CSIC, Madrid, p. 327. . The common octopus is easily adapted to captive conditions and has a rapid growth rate of 5% body weight per day.Iglesias J., S√°nchez F.J. and Otero J.J. (1997) \\"Primeras experiencias sobre el cultivo integral del pulpo (Octopus vulgaris, Cuvier) en el Instituto Espa√±ol de Oceanograf√≠a\\". In: Costa J., Abell√°n E., Garc√≠a Garc√≠a B., Ortega A. and Zamora S. (Eds.), VI Congreso Nacional de Acuicultura, Cartagena, Spain, pp. 221‚Äì226. It also has a high feed conversion rate with 30‚Äì60% of ingested food being incorporated in its own weight,Mangold, K.M. (1983) \\"Octopus vulgaris\\". In: Boyle, P.R. (Ed.), Cephalopod Life Cycles, vol. 1. Academic Press, London, pp. 335‚Äì364.Aguado, F., Garc√≠a Garc√≠a, B. (2002) \\"Growth and food intake models in Octopus vulgaris Cuvier/1797: influence of body weight, temperature, sex and diet\\" Aquac. Int. 10: 361‚Äì377. and a high fecundity of 100,000‚Äì500,000 eggs per female.  Temperature  There is an optimum temperature at which a cold- blooded species does best in terms of growth, survival and food intake. The common octopus is sensitive to temperature, with an optimum range for commercial growth of 16‚Äì21 ¬∞C. Above its optimal thermal range, growth and food intake decrease, and above 23 ¬∞C loss in weight and increased mortality has been recorded. A narrow thermal band can mean seasonality in growth due to seasonal variations in water temperatures. The incorporation of temperature control mechanisms, such as in the use of closed or onshore farming systems, can reduce seasonal variances in production.  Nutrition  Crustaceans, such as crabs and lobster are an important dietary constituent of both natural and captive populations of octopus.Garc√≠a Garc√≠a, B., Cerezo Valverde, J. (2006) \\"Optimal proportions of crabs and fish in diet for common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) ongrowing\\" Aquaculture, 253: 502‚Äì511. Fish are not as important. Fish-based diets have been shown to provide both lower growth rates and food conversion to growth ratios in captive octopus. This may be because of high lipid levels in fish flesh. Cephalopods, such as octopus and squids, show low lipid digestibility as a result of low lipid requirements. Consequently, a large component of the fish feed will not be taken up.Lee P.G. (1994) \\"Nutrition of cephalopods: Fueling the system\\" In: P√∂rtner H.O., O‚ÄôDor R.K. and Mac- millan D.L. (eds), Physiology of Cephalopod Molluscs: Lifestyle and Performance Adaptations Gordon & Brench Publishers, Switzerland, pp. 35‚Äì51. Crustacean diets are favored possibly as a result of their high protein relative to lipid levels. Whether octopus farming is profitable depends in large part on how much it costs to maintain a steady supply of crustaceans. Economic profitability can be maximized without significantly compromising biological productivity by incorporating a mix of fish and crustacean-based feed strategies. Garc√≠a Garc√≠a and Cerezo Velverde (2006) found a feeding regime of one day of crab followed by three days of fish can reduce the cost of producing one kg of octopus by a predicted value of ‚Ç¨2.96.  Juveniles  Commercial aquaculture so far has been confined to starting with young juveniles caught in the wild, weighing about 750 g. In Spain, these juveniles are purchased from local fishermen and transferred to offshore floating sea cages. There they are fattened with bycatch (fish, molluscs and crabs) for several months until a commercial size, about 3 kilograms, is reached. However, acquiring juveniles in this way, from the wild, further increases the fishing pressure on octopus stocks that are already managed badly, possibly producing cascades in marine ecosystems. A cost analysis of this practice found that over 40% of total costs went into acquiring the juveniles. The profitability of this approach is low, depending as it does on fishing and the supply of sub-adults, a costly and highly variable process.Garc√≠a Garc√≠a, J., Rodriguez Gonzalez, L.M., Garc√≠a Garc√≠a, B. (2004) \\"Cost analysis of octopus ongrowing installation in Galicia\\" Span. Jour. Agr. Res. 2(4): 521-537.  Paralarva  The bottleneck currently hindering the commercial development of octopus aquaculture is the difficulty of rearing octopus during their early paralarva stage.Carrasco, J.F., Arronte, J.C., Rodr√≠guez, C. (2006) \\"Paralarval rearing of the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris (Cuvier)\\" Aquac. Res. 37: 1601‚Äì1605. Paralarva is the name given to the larva of cephalopods. Paralarvae are small, less than 3 millimetres at hatching, with a long planktonic life stage. Current rearing techniques are inadequate, resulting in very high mortality rates.Moxica, C; F. Linares, J. J. Otero, J. Iglesias and F. J. S√°nchez(2002) \\"Cultivo intensivo de paralarvas de pulpo, Octopus vulgaris Cuvier, 1797, en tanques de 9 m3\\" Bol. Inst. Esp. Oceanogr., 18 (1-4): 31-36. Results vary when octopus paralarvae are fed different combinations of prey. The best results have been with a mix of brine shrimp and other living prey, such as crab zoeae. However the survival and settlement rates of the paralarvae is typically low in such studies, highlighting the difficulties in raising octopus paralarvae. Maintaining high survival rates for paralarvae appears to be the main factor limiting the development of a fully closed life cycle octopus hatchery system.Iglesiasa J.; F.J. S√°ncheza, J.G.F. Bersanob, J.F. Carrascoc, J. Dhontd, L. Fuentesa, F. Linarese, J.L. Mu√±ozf, S. Okumurag, J. Rooh, T. van der Meereni, E.A.G. Vidalj and R. Villanuevak (2007) \\"Rearing of Octopus vulgaris paralarvae: Present status, bottlenecks and trends\\" Aquaculture, 266 (1-4): 1‚Äì15. To achieve both profitable and environmentally sustainable results, much research has been focused on paralarval rearing.Vaz-Pires, P., Seixas, P., Barbosa, A. (2004) \\"Aquaculture potential of the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris Cuvier, 1797): a review\\" Aquaculture, 238(1‚Äì4): 221‚Äì238. In 2005, scientists from the principal research groups in the field concluded the key factor affecting paralarval mortality is nutrition, making nutritional research the highest priority. There is \\"no reason not to believe that the aquacultural rearing of octopus will be of great economic potential\\" as soon as the rearing technology and nutritional issues have been addressed. Research in these areas is promising.

Eucheuma species are used in the production of carrageenan, an ingredient for cosmetics, food processing, and industrial manufacturing, as well as a food source for people in the Philippines and parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. Eucheuma cottonii ‚Äì cultivated in the Philippines ‚Äì is the particular species known as gus√¥. Other species include Betaphycus gelatinae, Eucheuma denticulatum, and several species of the genus Kappaphycus, including K. alvarezii. Since the mid-1970s, Kappaphycus and Eucheuma have been a major source for the expansion of the carrageenan industry. Though commercially significant, species of Eucheuma are difficult to identify without the aid of close scientific examination, as different species may have similar morphologies. Some eighteen to twenty species alone fall within the genus Eucheuma, represented by the groups Cottoniformia, Gelatiformia, and Anaxiferae. Gus√¥ is listed in the Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods of the Philippines by the Slow Food movement.  Distribution  Eucheuma farming, Tanzania Eucheuma are naturally found within the range of 20 degrees either side of the Equator in the Indo-Pacific region from eastern Africa to Guam, and are most concentrated in Southeast Asia. A few species are found on Lord Howe Island and in southwestern Australia. As a commercial crop, Eucheuma has since been distributed to many regions away from their original natural habitats, including Japan, Hawaii, and island nations in the South Pacific.  Habitat and biology  Women collecting Eucheuma in Jambiani (Zanzibar). Eucheuma are typically found below the low tide mark to the upper subtidal zone of a reef, growing on sand to rocky seafloor areas along a coral reef, where water movement is slow to moderate. Their growth is similar to terrestrial plant species, where Eucheuma have a growing tip, or apical meristem, which is also capable of dividing to form new growing branches. They also show a triphasic life cycle, consisting of a gametophyte (n) (dioecious), carposporophyte (2n), and the sporophyte (2n). Both the gametophyte and the more robust sporophyte stage are significant to the development of the seaweed, where their characteristics allow for increased vegetative regeneration.  Commercial aspects  Underwater Eucheuma farming, Philippines Commercial growth of Eucheuma is an important source of income for people living in developing nations, where the production of the low-valued seaweed can be a sustainable source of income with lower environmental costs compared to other sectors of aquaculture. As Eucheuma are some of the most common and fastest growing species of seaweeds, their commercial aspects are visible by large quantities grown and harvested over short periods of time, possessing the ability to reach ten times their mass in some 45 to 60 days in warm tropical settings. Once harvested, the product can be dried, packaged, and then transported to areas ready for carrageenan extraction or used as a food supply. The major producers of Eucheuma include the Philippines (~92% total global production; 2005 statistics FAO) and China (~7% total global production). It is also farmed in Tanzania and Kiribati. This may be underrepresented as countries including Indonesia and Malaysia, which are also significant producers of these species, do not accurately report their output to the FAO. As Eucheuma is commercially important for economic growth, average annual production of total dried seaweeds, including other groups of sea plants, reached nearly 125,000 tonnes in the Philippines alone, by 2000‚Äì2004, with a value of approximately $US139 million. The 1889 book The Useful Native Plants of Australia records that Eucheuma speciosa, was commonly known as the \\"Jelly Plant' in Western Australia and that \\"This is a remarkable sea-weed of a very gelatinous character which enters into the culinary arrangements of the people of Western Australia for making jelly, blancmange, etc. Size and cement can also be made from it. It is cast ashore from deep water.\\"  Farming  Information based on morphological characteristics, DNA fingerprinting, and growth performance during different crop seasons is used to facilitate Eucheuma crop management, for which high-growth species are used for seed stocks, mostly from the Philippines. Once seed stocks have been obtained from the wild, they undergo cleaning in order to rid them of dirt and other contaminants, where they are then transferred to nursery sites in styrofoam boxes with air holes in the top, without exposure to the wind or the sun. Site selection is important in developing potential seaweed farms, and certain criteria must be met first in order to optimize production. These criteria include suitable current and wave actions to allow for absorption of nutrients, sufficient but not excessive light to allow for optimum photosynthesis, a sufficient water depth not hindered by low tide exposure, an optimum water temperature between 27‚Äì30 degrees Celsius, salinity levels of 30‚Äì35 0/00, and areas with little presence of grazers, microorganisms, suspended silt, and epiphytes. Seed stocks are then prepared by tying Eucheuma cuttings with soft plastic tying materials to monolines in both the bottom monoline and floating methods, where the nylon lines run parallel to each other at one-meter intervals to allow for water currents to flow through. The seaweed is than harvested 10‚Äì12 weeks after planting in order to allow the crop to mature and increase its carrageenan content. The farming of Eucheuma has raised certain environmental issues, mostly centered on the ecology and biodiversity of coastal environments. The ecology of Eucheuma farm sites may be characterized by overcrowding, as other farmers may be attracted to the farming site, eventually exceeding the carrying capacity of the environment. This in turn may change the overall hydrology of the area, impacting on other species that may be present. Domestic pollution from farmhouse waste disposal may also impact the nearby environment.

It is a wooded plateau. The village is known for its \\"hushed bucolic vibe and cool breezes\\". It is from the coast. Fauna noted in the forest surrounding the town is tortoise. The population in the village is one of the lowest in Mauritius, according to the census made by Statistics Mauritius in 2011; the population was at 783. Creoles form the major work force in this village of the Black River district. Creole Morisyen of the village have adopted to the concept of preserving the natural environment as it has provided them sustenance, while other creoles are in favour of ethnic tourism. Creole cuisine and the Rasrafarin music group and Group Natir are cultural traditions of the village which are popular. History The Chamarel village is named after the Frenchman Charles Antoine de Chazal de Chamarel, who lived in the area around 1800. In the past the entire area of the village belonged to him. Mathew Flinders who was captured in Mauritius during the Napoleonic war was hosted by Chamarel in his estate. However, the local residents of the village call the area as the \\"Valley of Blacks\\". Economy The village has plantations of sugarcane and pineapples. Coffee plantations are also extensive.Arabica coffee plants and palm salad trees are lined on the way to the waterfall. Landmarks Seven Coloured Earths,a heap of earth's crust showing seven colours Chamarel Falls One of the notable places of interest is the Coloured Earths, which is about to the south west of the town. Coloured Earths is a phenomenon resulting from colour variations due to cooling of molten rock. The lava formations are estimated to be of 3.5 to 7 million years in age. These are heaps of exposed earth's crust which show up in seven colours when the sun light falls on them. Viewing them in the morning hours when sun rays and the dew mingle bring out the best of its colours. A closer view is better than the views from the timber platforms and walkways erected for the purpose. The colour earth phenomenon is located downstream of the water fall on the Black River valley where the land is barren and plain which measures about with hardly any vegetation. It gives the appearance of furrows in rows, as colors are observed in horizontal ridges known as \\"Les Cotes de Melon\\" (\\"The Melon's Slices\\"). An examination of the ground condition where the colours of different shades, varying from \\"yellow and yellowish brown to bright red, purple, and coal black\\" indicates about forty hues. The samples collected from this area have been subject to chemical analysis which reveal that the formation consists of cohesive formation of ferruginous clays without any organic matter, and devoid or with least presence of any principal elements of soil fertility. There is hardly any nitrogen but traces of lime, potash and phosphoric acid have been noted. However, the dominant percentage is of iron and alumina. Another interesting place to see is the Chamarel waterfall on the River du Cap. This is from the entrance gate of the town. The water falls by ( is also mentioned.) along a vertical cliff. Abseiling from the top of the fall is a water sport that can be organised upon request to some professionals service providers. Abseiling is done from the location where the fall begins and ends at the water pond down below, which is in an oval shape. The spray of the fall rises to half the height of the fall. Approach to the falls is stiff and slippery. One more place of interest in Chamarel is the Rhumerie de Chamarel, a distillery located in the plantations in the hills of Chamarel. The distillery, based on sugarcane, also has a museum where the process of manufacturing rum is displayed and narrated. It was established by the owner of Beachcomber hotel in 2008 and is known for the eco-friendly manufacturing process in which all byproducts are reused. The rum is said to have a good flavour and can be tasted at the L'Alchimiste restaurant at the site. The village church is the Chapel of St. Anne. Every year on 15 August, a pilgrimage, the Catholic Feast of Assumption, is held here when a fair is organized, funds collected and people served with the \\"Curry number two\\", a delicacy; the number two suffix to the name of the cuisine is attributed to monkey which takes second precedence in evolution. Popular adventure sports activities in the village are mountain biking, and horse back riding in a riding school.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on June 20, 2012, along with \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" as part of an hour long season premiere. The episode was written by Eric Horsted and directed by Stephen Sandoval. Wanda Sykes guest stars as Bev. Plot Professor Farnsworth acquires a new robotic soda vending machine named Bev. Fry becomes addicted to the \\"Slurm Loco\\" drink she offers, and begins to glow bright green as a side effect. Bender comes to resent Bev since she does not dispense alcoholic beverages, and she soon comes to dislike him as well. The two eventually fight after Bev chases away a pair of fembots Bender tries making out with, though they end up having sex instead. Bev soon gives birth to a baby robot while dispensing a drink for Fry, to Bender's surprise as he had not known about 31st-century robots' ability to procreate. Bender initially rejects his son and attempts to give Bev full custody, but Bev runs away and leaves their child in his care. Bender soon comes to appreciate his son after he takes delight in Bender's bending abilities, and names the child Ben. Ben grows up under Bender's care and states that he wants to be a bending robot like his father. However, because arm-control software is inherited maternally and Bev has no arms, Ben is unable to bend objects. In addition, he only has one expansion slot, which houses his memory card. Despite this, Bender continues to raise Ben in the hopes that Ben will overcome his disability. During a ceremony celebrating Ben's passage into adulthood, Bev returns and takes custody of her son from Bender. Bender kidnaps Ben and tries to run, but the two are caught by the police when Ben tries and fails to bend a grate at a dam as an escape route. As Bender prepares to return Ben to Bev, she gives birth to another child conceived with Officer URL and decides to keep this child instead, leaving Bender and Ben alone. To fulfill Ben's dream of becoming a bending robot, a tearful Bender allows Farnsworth to replace Ben's memory card with a bending software card, erasing Ben's memories of his childhood and leaving him unaware of Bender's identity. The Planet Express crew fly Ben to a bending university on a foggy night, with the brightly glowing naked Fry strapped to the prow of the Planet Express ship to light the way, in reference to the story of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Cultural references The opening caption quote, \\"Not sure if new episode or just rerun of episode I watched drunk,\\" along with the picture of Fry squinting (taken from the season 2 episode \\"The Lesser of Two Evils\\") is a reference to the Futurama Fry internet meme. The meme was also referenced in advertisements for the seventh season leading up to the premiere. The episode title is a reference to the term The Birds and the Bees. After the \\"relationship\\" scene with Bev and Bender, the impression left in the wall is a reference to the freezing of Han Solo in carbonite in The Empire Strikes Back. At the Temple of Robotology where Ben has his Bot Mitzvah, the sign on the building's entrance references the holiday Lag BaOmer. Reception The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade, stating, \\"It's mean- spirited‚Äîand, worse, lazy‚Äîto make Bev into the easiest stereotype of a crappy mom, and most of the jokes that come out of that characterization aren't great. Sykes makes the most of the part, but there isn't much to it. Thankfully, the episode is more about Bender and Ben bonding, and Bender turning out to be a doting, supportive father. It's a little sweeter than usual, and somehow, the attempts to undercut that sweetness just make the relationship even more adorable; a montage of father and son spending time together includes petty theft and bank robbery, and yet seems about as wholesome as the show ever gets. But it works, because it's fun to see Bender getting emotionally attached to anything\\". Max Nicholson of IGN rated the episode an 8/10, writing, \\"Overall [...] this was a solid entry for Season 7. The writing is still sharp, and the animation has never looked better. It was also nice to see Bender's character treading a little more ground beyond the traditional backseat one-liners. While Ben would obviously disrupt the balance of the main ensemble, it was a fitting introduction for what could be a recurring character on the show (similar to Cubert or Dwight).\\" The writer of the episode, Eric Horsted, was nominated for Outstanding Writing in an Animated Television Production, at the 40th Annie Awards, though he did not win.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on July 18, 2012. The episode was written by Michael Rowe and directed by Crystal Chesney- Thompson. Plot The Planet Express crew are assigned to return the \\"stolen\\" Moon rocks from the Apollo missions to the Moon. There, they attend a \\"Butterfly Derby\\" where women in butterfly wingsuits battle and wrestle each other to near-death. When the announcer Abner Doubledeal asks for amateur challengers to the current reigning champions, Leela and Amy step forward. They are severely trounced by their opponents on their first attempt but are nonetheless offered opportunities to become a regular Butterfly Derby team called the \\"Wingnuts\\". The pair are unable to improve on their first performance and lose every match they're placed in. While in the locker room, they see the champions buying a substance called \\"Nectar\\" that helps them to build body strength. Leela and Amy quickly jump at the opportunity and buy Nectar themselves, soon becoming as strong as the champions and developing a long winning streak in further matches. Meanwhile, Fry and Kif have found their respective girlfriends, Leela and Amy, to be brutish, unromantic and abusive while on the influence of Nectar. Soon, their Nectar supplier runs out when the reigning champions buy out the remaining supply. The Professor realizes that Nectar is a substance created by a flower on Kif's home planet, Amphibios 9, and Kif, Fry, Bender, Leela, and Amy set off to collect more. At a butterfly preserve on Kif's home planet, they are told to beware the male butterflies by the Grand Butterfly Curator. Fry discovers the insect first, who sprays Fry with copious amounts of liquid in self-defense. Having collected enough of the nectar, they spend the night at Kif's parents' home, each sleeping in separate bedrooms. Leela becomes uncharacteristically enamored with Fry, but both are shocked when Amy becomes just as aroused by him. On return to Earth, they realize that the liquid contains the male butterfly's mating pheremones. Amy and Leela's abuse of Nectar has made them susceptible to the butterflies' pheremones and they are forced to quit Nectar cold turkey in order to break its hold on them. During this time, Fry begins to feel weird, and at one point, creates and envelops himself in a cocoon aboard the Planet Express ship. After overcoming their addiction, Leela and Amy have one more match in the Butterfly Derby against the reigning champs. To add to the excitement, the match is held over a pit of lava. Without the Nectar, Leela and Amy are quickly outmatched, the champions tearing their wings and forcing them to fly together to avoid falling into the lava. As the champs attempt to tear off the last of their wings, Fry awakens from the cocoon as a large butterfly and enters the arena. The champions are drawn to his pheremones, allowing Leela and Amy to leave the arena safely. After the match, the Planet Express crew recovers Fry believing him to have fully transformed into an insect by the liquid. But soon, the insect shell cracks open revealing a delirious and still human Fry inside. Reception Zack Handlen of The A.V.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on June 27, 2012. The plot is a parody of the Birther Movement. Plot As the episode started with an extended intro, it begins as Bender jumps off the Planet Express Ship after seeing an ad for free beer. As Earth's election time nears, President Richard Nixon's Head builds his reelection campaign platform on the promise to order the construction of a \\"Dyson fence\\" around the southern part of the Solar System, which will keep out illegal extraterrestrial aliens. Leela, angered at Nixon's non-existent competition, tries to become involved by attending a debate of the other candidates. Although most of them simply cater to the crowd, she finds one, Senator Chris Travers, who appears honest and with strong ideals counter to Nixon, most of which are ridiculed by the audience. She later finds him alone at his campaign headquarters, attacking his own posters in despair. She attempts to encourage him, and becomes his campaign manager. Leela's efforts soon put Travers in the spotlight as a front-running candidate, quickly gaining momentum. Nixon discreetly employs Bender to try to find dirt about Travers' background. Bender struggles to find any blemish on Travers' history, eventually coming across that his middle name is \\"Zaxxar\\", which Nixon claims is an alien-sounding name, and demands that Travers show his \\"Earth certificate\\". Travers states that he is Earth-born, having been born in a hospital in Kenya, but refuses to show the certificate. As the populace swing back in favor of Nixon, Leela takes it upon herself to retrieve the certificate, with Fry and Bender's help. At the hospital, they are unable to find any record and learn Travers is waiting there for them. He reveals that he has no Earth certificate because he has not been born yet ‚Äî he is a time traveler. He will be born in this hospital tomorrow. In the future, with the fence erected, there are no aliens to do the menial work on Earth. This causes Earth's economy to collapse and starvation and civil unrest become common around the globe. Nixon then eliminates the remaining working class and turns them into \\"Soylent Majority\\" soup to feed the poor. Nixon assigns those tasks to the robots. The robots, led by Bender, turn against humanity. Travers was sent back from fifteen years in the future (using a copy of the time travel code from Futurama: Bender's Big Score) to stop Nixon from winning this election. Travers, after arriving in the past, had spent the last several years becoming the best candidate to run against Nixon to prevent this future from happening. Leela realizes that this is a compelling story, and arranges for Travers' birth to be broadcast live to the world to prove definitively that he was born on Earth. Travers soon handily defeats Nixon at the election. Unfortunately as Bender points out, this means the robot uprising will never happen and thus Travers would have never been sent back in time. A temporal paradox occurs and erases Travers from time, undoing all the events of the episode. Now running unopposed, Nixon proclaims an uncontested victory while Leela and the Planet Express crew forget all about Travers. Reception Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, focusing on the episode's social commentary. Handlen remarked, \\"It seems to be saying something, only it isn‚Äôt really, but you still kind of care a little.

It originally aired on Comedy Central on July 4, 2012. The episode was written by series co-producer Dan Vebber and directed by Edmund Fong. Plot The crew go to the aquarium where Bender becomes obsessed with snapping pictures of celebrity actor Calculon. The crew is frustrated by the finickiness of Bender's photography, especially that he uses a film camera instead of digital. After reviewing the photos, Zoidberg suggests that Bender become a papparazzi photographer for a celebrity gossip magazine. Though his career is lucrative, he becomes determined to take a photo of the most lauded and mysterious actor, Langdon Cobb. Cobb is considered the greatest actor on Earth, but wears a paper bag over his head, disguising his face in all his roles and public appearances. Bender manages to sneak past Cobb's fungus-based guard dog and takes a picture of him without his paper bag. Cobb warns him never to show his face to anyone or the consequences could be dire. Bender develops the photo of Cobb and shows it to Fry, Amy, and Hermes, and the sight of it causes their lifeforce to violently escape their bodies, leaving them as nothing but empty, deflated husks. Professor Farnsworth deduces that Cobb must be a \\"quantum lichen\\", a race of alien lichen parasites that feed off attention and admiration. Victims who pay attention to the lichen are feeding it, but gazing at its face will cause a biological being to have their lifeforce sucked out. Quantum lichens are composed of an algae component, which serves as its id, drawing attention from its prey, and a fungal component that represents its ego, absorbing and growing from attention and lifeforce. Destroying the fungal ego will return its victims' lifeforces. However, unlike regular lichens, quantum lichen components are not physically connected to one another, so the fungal aspect may be anywhere apart from the algae component. Bender realizes that the guard dog fungus is Cobb's fungus component and that it is growing from Cobb's fame. To weaken his ego, the crew enlists Calculon to challenge Cobb to an acting competition. They suggest he perform the death scene in Romeo and Juliet, and Calculon recognizes that the only way to ensure his full believability is to take actual robot poison and die. Though Calculon gives a moving performance and dies (unbeknownst to the audience and judges), Cobb's performance is still superior and his adulation causes his ego to grow immensely. Cobb explains to the crew that while his race typically travels from planet to planet, stealing entire races' lifeforces, on Earth, he discovered that he could feed off of its citizens' mindless obsession with celebrities forever. He then shows his face to the remaining crew, who are drained of their lifeforces. To stop him, Bender attempts to show him the picture of his own face, reasoning that as a biological creature, Cobb should likewise be destroyed by his own image. The attempt fails, as Cobb cannot be harmed by his own image, but it instead causes him to admire himself, creating a feedback loop that makes his ego explode. With Cobb's fungal ego destroyed, he is defeated and the crew's lifeforce is returned. As they celebrate, Bender takes a group photo that shows only a close-up of his own face when developed.

In that twentieth anniversary television story, Borusa, President of the Time Lords, is seen scooping up various friends, enemies and incarnations of the Doctor and forcing them to battle each other in a forbidden region of their world known as The Death Zone. The Fifth Doctor takes a transmat device from the Master, which transports him from the Death Zone to the Time Lord capitol. This audio story takes place after he transmats, but before he arrives in the capitol. *For the all companions in this audio, the story takes place long after they stopped traveling with him. *Ian, a school teacher from the 1960s, was in the first Doctor Who story, An Unearthly Child. He, and fellow teacher, Barbara Wright, were unwilling companions to the First Doctor and his granddaughter Susan. The two finally got themselves back to the 1960s a couple years later, by means of a captured Dalek time machine (which subsequently self-destructed), in The Chase. Ian first encountered the Daleks on his first trip off Earth in, The Daleks. In that story, as in this, he crawls inside the casing of and pretends to be a Dalek. *The Chase also introduced Steven, a space pilot from the future. He became the King of a new society on an alien world in The Savages. *Sara travelled with the Doctor and Steven during the twelve episode story The Daleks' Master Plan. She was a security agent from the future. At the end of Daleks' Master Plan, she aged to death. In the audio dramas, Home Truths and The Guardian of the Solar System, she was, in a way, resurrected. *Just after The Savages, the Doctor met Polly in The War Machines. She was a secretary from the 1960s who journeyed in the TARDIS, alongside her friend, sailor Ben Jackson. She and Ben witnessed the Doctor's first regeneration in The Tenth Planet. It is that adventure that the Fifth Doctor is referring to when he recalls Polly standing up to the Cybermen. The Second Doctor returned Ben and Polly home (the same day they left) in The Faceless Ones. *Nyssa was an alien princess who met the Fourth Doctor in The Keeper of Traken, and witnessed his regeneration into the Fifth, in Logopolis. She left him to work on a plague spaceship in Terminus. *Steven and Sara faced the Daleks together in The Daleks' Master Plan. *Polly helped the newly regenerated Doctor battle the Daleks in The Power of the Daleks. *Nyssa has only had Dalek stories in audios, such as The Mutant Phase and Plague of the Daleks. *Nyssa met the Sontarans in the audio Heroes of Sontar. *At this point in his life, the Doctor hasn't reunited with any of these companions, nor they with him. However, he has already spent time traveling with an older Nyssa. The CD cover art indicates that Nyssa is still relatively young, putting her placement after Terminus, but long before her reunion in Cobwebs. *Ian is also timescooped in The Time Museum. *This is the first story to feature the Daleks battling the Sontarans, although they were seen to be allied in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\".

William Wilson secured funding for the event from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1985. Organized by a team of folklorists and local cowboy poets including Hal Cannon and Waddie Mitchell, the Elko Cowboy Poetry Gathering started in 1985 as a place where Western ranchers and cowboys could gather to share poems about their lives working cattle. From the beginning, it was clear these men and women had found their tribe, an artistic community that few knew existed. Three decades later, the tribe is now a nation of Western poets, musicians, artisans and storytellers, sharing their creativity across the country, telling their stories of hard work, heartbreak and hilarity, and what it means to make your way in the rangeland West. The Elko Gathering was renamed the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering thanks to an act of Congress in 1980. Known simply as Elko to many, the Gathering embraces its role as a pilgrimage destination for thousands of ranch folk and others who love the West and come to learn and experience art that grows from a connection to the rhythms of earth and sky. The National Cowboy Poetry Gathering is six days of poetry, music, dancing, workshops, exhibits, conversations, food and fellowship, rooted in tradition but focused on today‚Äôs rural West The inaugural year featured 40 poets, and an audience of less than 1,000. At the 25th anniversary gathering in 2009, retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was the keynote speaker. Other keynote addresses have been given by such luminaries as Temple Grandin, Stuart Udall, Barry Corbin, and more. The invited artist participants list is long, and has included Don Edwards, Waddie Mitchell, Joel Nelson, Wallace McRae, Riders in the Sky, Georgie Sicking, Dalton Wilcox, Ian Tyson, and Baxter Black. The Elko Gathering led the way: among many other Gatherings across the nation, the Texas Cowboy Poetry Gathering, held in 1987 at Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas, followed the original event in Elko. Alvin G. Davis, who attended the exposition in Alpine as a cowboy poet, launched a comparable group in Lubbock with the formation in 1989 of the American Cowboy Culture Association, which co-sponsors an annual National Cowboy Symposium and Celebration held annually on the Thursday through Sunday after Labor Day.

It started operations in 1964 at Hanover Street in Fitzroy, and took on the name Hanover; the same as the street. It has 7 offices in Melbourne providing different services such as housing support, employment services, and various other support services to people experiencing homelessness. It's an independent and non-profit organisation not affiliated with any religious group, institution or government. It is funded by private, corporate and government donors.  History  =Hanover= Hanover was founded in 1964 as one of the first specialist homeless support agencies in Melbourne.History compiled by Hanover staff, volunteers and Board members The name was taken from Hanover Street in Fitzroy, where the organisation was first based. Hanover‚Äôs founders were clear that it was to be an agency different from other homelessness service providers. It was to be an organisation driven by evidence and one which recognised its clients as active citizens, with dignity, aspirations, talents and strengths. It was also to be an agency which led change. Reflecting the social and policy movements under which it was formed, Hanover was established with no structural links to governments, churches or institutions and incorporated as a non-profit company managed by a board of directors. Initially its primary focus was support for homeless men in the inner city. Over the past 45 years this scope has broadened significantly and our work now covers Victorians of all ages and life stages. Research has always been at the core of Hanover‚Äôs work, evidence of this can be found in the following extract from the findings of the Interim Committee which established Hanover in 1964: Much exact information is required as a basis for planning further work with the men. The methods of the agency should be regarded as experimental, and results evaluated and reported. Clients case records would be compiled so as to allow elucidation of common patterns, and special study might be made of such subjects as excessive drinking and employment difficulties. In 1969, under the leadership of Bob U‚ÄôRen, Hanover began a campaign against the closure of Gordon House, at that time a 400 bed commercial common lodging house for homeless men. The early 1970s also saw a small number of women beginning to use homeless services set up for men. In 1972 Hanover was incorporated under the Companies Act, and our charter was changed to include women and families ‚Äì widening the range of services provided. In 1972 management of Gordon House was taken over by Hanover until it was decommissioned in 1976. In 1976 Hanover opened the new Gordon House at 20 Lorimer Street in Melbourne. New Gordon House was a revolutionary development, providing clients experiencing homelessness with a higher standard of accommodation than was previously available, and plenty of individual freedom. The 1980s saw a sustained focus on providing services that addressed the specific needs of people experiencing homelessness, including the establishment of the joint Commonwealth and State Government funded Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. This led to a period of expansion of support and programs delivered by Hanover. Under new leadership in the early 1990s, Hanover was restructured, and funding from the State and Federal Governments enabled the redevelopment of Gordon House. During this time specific services were developed targeting the particular needs of families, single women and young adults. At the same time, Hanover‚Äôs research focus was strengthened, and Michael Horn was appointed as Hanover Research Manager in 1991. In the late 1990s, drug use amongst residents at Melbourne‚Äôs major Crisis Accommodation Centres had reached epidemic levels, prompting Hanover to spearhead a major trial of new strategies to provide support to clients using drugs. Funded by the Victorian Government, the Homeless Drug Dependency Program was a revolutionary shift in supporting people experiencing homelessness out of drug dependency. In recent years Hanover has added Employment Services to the suite of services provided, helping people who are unemployed build their skills and get back into the workforce. With education an increasing focus for Hanover, a range of innovative programs are delivered across sites supporting clients to engage in education and training. =HomeGround Services= HomeGround Services logo HomeGround Services was formed in December 2002 from the merger of two like-minded organizations to combine the housing experience of Argyle Street Housing and the support and outreach experience of Outreach Victoria. It was a homelessness, housing and support agency working to end homelessness in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It was part of the Australian Common Ground Alliance, which is affiliated with Common Ground (NYC). HomeGround Services has offices were in Collingwood, Victoria; Preston, Victoria; St Kilda, Victoria; Prahran, Victoria; and at Elizabeth Street Common Ground in the CBD. HomeGround Services‚Äô vision to work towards ending homelessness in Melbourne coincides with recent federal and state progress in this direction. The Australian Government has released its White Paper on Homelessness, which includes targets for reducing the number of people who are homeless, and the Victorian Government committed to a new Victorian Homelessness Strategy. However, a number of factors continue to contribute to homelessness including: * Housing affordability. * Family and other crises. * A limited supply of, and poor access to, affordable and supportive housing. Clients HomeGround Services worked with a diverse range of clients including those referred from mainstream health organizations, the mental health sector, criminal justice, child protection and others. Its practices, approaches and models in dealing with its clients are based on international best practice on homelessness. Client numbers Annually, HomeGround Services provided: * Assistance to 9000 homeless households in crisis or at risk of homelessness to find shelter and long-term housing. * Management of around 330 transitional housing properties. * Support to more than 700 public housing households in order to prevent eviction. Activities HomeGround Services worked in the areas of homelessness, housing, support services and social change advocacy. Its services included: * Crisis housing advice service (Initial Assessment and Planning) * Housing Outreach Worker program * Justice Housing Support Program * Mental health programs including ConnectED and the Housing Mental Health Pathways Program * Outreach programs * Private Rental Access Program * Private Rental Management Program * Social Housing Advocacy and Support Program * Supportive Housing Development * Tenancy and Property program * Advocacy HomeGround Services was a partner in the Elizabeth Street Common Ground (Melbourne, Australia) supportive housing project that aimed to deliver more than 131 homes based on the Common Ground model in Elizabeth Street, central Melbourne in October 2010. HomeGround Services will provide the associated health, training, support and employment services to be located on the site. In 2009 HomeGround Services joined with 40 other organizations in Call this a home? campaign for safe rooming houses in Victoria, advocating for reform of Victoria‚Äôs private rooming house sector. HomeGround Services won the tender for Victoria's Melbourne Street to Home program in partnership with The Salvation Army and working with the Royal District Nursing Service. Melbourne Street to Home is another key model from the Federal White Paper on Homelessness. In July 2015 it merged with Hanover to become Launch Housing.  Services  Hanover provides a range of services to people experiencing homelessness, at risk of homelessness or housing crisis. These include: Crisis Accommodation, Medium term and transitional housing, Support, Early Intervention programs, Education programs, Health, Nutrition and wellbeing programs.http://www.hanover.org.au See also *Housing Commission of Victoria *Homelessness in Australia *Supported Accommodation Assistance Program  References  Category:Organisations based in Melbourne Category:Homelessness in Australia Category:Non-profit organisations based in New South Wales ","title":"Launch Housing"},{"id":"33246778","text":"Zane Taylor (born April 23, 1988) is an American football center who is currently a free agent.

My boss and colleagues said if I got picked they would send me away and that's how it started.\\" Giddy's first national competition was the National Games in 1969, and his first international competition was the 1970 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Edinburgh, where he won three gold medals and a silver medal. At the 1972 Heidelberg Paralympics, he won a silver medal in the Men's 100 m Wheelchair 4 event, and also participated in the Australia men's national wheelchair basketball team. He participated in the 1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Dunedin, New Zealand,. He was selected but did not participate in the 1976 Toronto Paralympics due to illness, and also did not participate in the 1980 Arnhem Paralympics. He won a gold medal at the 1984 New York/Stoke Mandeville Paralympics in the Men's Discus 4 event, a silver medal in the same event at the 1988 Seoul Paralympics, a silver medal in the Men's Discus THW6 event and a bronze medal in the Men's Shot Put THW6 event at the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics, and a bronze medal in the Men's Shot Put F55 event at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympics. Just before the 2000 Sydney Paralympics, his classification was changed from F56 to F55, and he was told that he had been competing in the wrong disability group for his entire career. He did not win any medals at the 2000 Games. Giddy regretted his disqualification by video footage in the shot put at the Sydney Games after throwing a world record. In 2002, while training in Germany for the world titles in France, he cracked his sternum and hurt his back in a fall. He then prepared for the 2004 Athens Paralympics, but the back injury had flared up again, and the plate in his back had broken in half. He retired in early 2004 due to the injury. He came back for the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, where he came seventh in the seated shot put, and was Australia's oldest ever Commonwealth Games athlete. At his farewell dinner in 2004, Chris Nunn, Head Coach of the Australian Athletics team at the Sydney Games, said \\"Whilst you may have travelled thousands of miles in economy class, your contribution has always been first class\\". Recognition In 1988, Giddy received an Advance Australia Award. In 2000, he received an Australian Sports Medal. That year, he carried the Sydney Olympic torch. He also received an Australia Day award and was given the key to the town of Kempsey. He was one of three Paralympians who campaigned about work safety for WorkCover during and after the 2000 Summer Paralympics. In 2010, his face was on the cover of the Kempsey White Pages and Yellow Pages.

Ties between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in Aden, however, have been damaged in recent years by Iran's support for the rival Yemeni government in Sanaa linked to the Houthi movement. The United States and the Saudi-backed government in Yemen have repeatedly accused Iran of providing funding and weapons to the Zaydi Shi‚Äôite Houthi rebels and on one occasion claimed to have discovered Iranian-made arms in rebel weapons caches. The US and Saudi Arabia have also accused Iran's allies in Lebanon and Syria of also supporting the Yemeni government in Sanna. Iran has also deployed submarines and warships off Yemen's coast, in the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea, ostensibly to conduct anti-piracy operations.‚ÄúLeader Calls Iran's Naval Presence in High Seas \\"Promising\\" ,‚Äù IRIB, July 24, 2011, http://english.irib.ir/radioislam/news/top-stories/item/79298-leader-calls- irans-naval-presence-in-high-seas-promising History In the 1960s, Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi supported Yemeni fighters against militant Marxists. In the late 1980s, the Islamic Republic of Iran moved more closely to Yemen following the end of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. In the early 1990s, Iran accommodated Houthi religious students. Among those students was Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who led the Houthi insurgency in Yemen against local government. Following the departure of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2012, Iranian officials began to rhetorically support the Houthis. In January 2013, a Yemeni boarding team operating from the USS Farragut (DDG-99) seized an Iranian dhow off the coast of Yemen that was found to be carrying Chinese QW-1 MANPADs. Relations between the two nations soured as Iran denied Yemeni assertions that the shipment was an Iranian attempt to arm rebel forces. The ship's movements had been tracked by American forces from the point when it loaded cargo at an Iranian military base until it was seized. On 2 October 2015, the Yemeni government Aden television reportedly announced that Yemen had severed diplomatic relations with Iran due to alleged Iranian support of Houthis to overthrow Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. A Yemeni government spokesman later denied the television report, saying that \\"the cabinet has not discussed until now the matter of severing diplomatic relations with Iran and no decision was taken\\". In late 2019, the Yemeni embassy in Tehran was transferred to the Houthi government.

He was born in Melbourne and lives in Canberra. He has cerebral palsy. His achievements and advocacy have made him one of Australia's most respected Paralympians. Early life MacDonald, the second of four brothers, grew up in Melbourne. His mother, Jeannie, a nurse, ensured that he had the same opportunities in sport as his brothers. While in primary school, he was required to catch a train into the city twice a week for physiotherapy. MacDonald did not walk without callipers until he was eight. MacDonald has stated that several teachers have played a pivotal role in his interest in sport. In primary school, his physical education teacher Gary Cole, an Australia international soccer player gave support and enthusiasm. In 1986, his family moved to Alice Springs and physical education teachers Shane Claridge and Michelle Parker, at Alice Springs High School, provided encouragement. He said: \\"They were the best teachers; they certainly gave me a big boost and helped to set my sights on track and field sports.\\" He started powerlifting and wanted to compete in this sport at the Paralympics. However, Parker encouraged him to turn to athletics and in his final year at high school, he was selected for the Barcelona Paralympics. Career Action shot of MacDonald (seen foreground, in Australian green and gold) during race competition at the 2000 Summer Paralympics MacDonald in August 2008 showing his 1996 gold medal in shot put MacDonald was an elite seated shot putter and competed at the Paralympic Games in Barcelona 1992, Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000, Athens 2004, Beijing 2008 and London 2012. At the 1992 Barcelona Games, he competed in the Men's 100m C5 and 200m C5-6 without winning any medals. In the lead up to the Barcelona Games, the people of Alice Springs raised $12,000 for him to compete. In 1994, he accepted an Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Athletes with a Disability residential scholarship in Canberra. He held this scholarship until 2009 and during this period was coached by Chris Nunn, Scott Goodman and Alison O'Riordan. After six months at the Australian Institute of Sport, he was strongly encouraged to switch to throwing events due to rapidly increasing standards in Paralympic sprinting and his powerlifting background. He had unsuccessfully tried throwing events in Little Athletics because of difficulties staying in the throwing circle due to poor balance. His functional classification allowed him to throw from a chair and he subsequently won a gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Games in the Men's Shot Put F32-33 event,. Retrieved 9 July 2013. in a world record. He was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for this achievement. MacDonald faced a difficult build up to the 2000 Sydney Games. He was going into Sydney as the defending champion but he did not meet the requirements to be classified as an F56 shot put athlete. He competed in his less preferred events, the Men's 100m T35 and Men's Discus F34. The controversy highlighted the issues of classifying athletes. At the 2004 Athens Games, he won a silver medal in the Men's Shot Put F32-33 event. At the 2008 Games, he finished sixth in the Men's Shot Put F33/34/52 event. At his sixth and final Games, the 2012 London Games, he finished 11th in the Men's Shot Put F34. MacDonald competed at five successive IPC Athletics World Championships from 1994 to 2011. In 1994, he competed in 100m, 200m and 400m T35 events. In 1998, he won a bronze medal in Men's Shot Put F34 and competed in Men's 100m and 200m T35 events. There was controversy during the Men's Shot Put where MacDonald was forced to change his technique mid-competition due to an official's ignorance of the rules. In 2002, he won gold in the Men's Shot Put F34 in a world record (10.69m) and competed in Men's Discus F33-34. In 2006, he won gold in the Men's Shot Put F34 event and competed in the Men's Discus F33-34 event. In 2011, he finished 6th in Men's Shot Put F34. At the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, he won a bronze medal in the Men's Shot Put F32/34/52. MacDonald during the shout put at the 2012 London Paralympics In 2005, MacDonald was recognised by the AIS for being on scholarship for ten years. He has also held a Northern Territory Institute of Sport scholarship. He retired as an athlete in January 2013. Jason Hellwig, CEO of the Australian Paralympic Committee made the following comment on his retirement ‚Äì I've known Hamish a long time through my involvement with athletics and have seen him develop as an athlete and a person. It's been great to watch a kid from Alice Springs rise to the heights of international sport and then contribute in such a meaningful way. MacDonald indicated that he would most likely remain involved in Paralympic sport as a coach. Coaching In 2015, he was coaching Jayden Sawyer and Kath Proudfoot in Canberra. He was selected as a throws coach for the Australian team competing at the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships. Advocacy MacDonald is an advocate for disabled sport, and travels the world to do this. He has visited the South Pacific and Caribbean to help create local disabled sport programs. He has been involved with the International Paralympic Committee as a member of the International Paralympic Committee Athlete Commission. In 1998, he became involved with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). With the UNHCR, he visited two refugee camps located on the border between Thailand and Cambodia. At the 2003 South Pacific Games, he was an athlete ambassador for the World Anti-Doping Authority. MacDonald's work as a sports participation advisor at the Australian Sports Commission has led to several initiatives to educate people, raise awareness and change peoples' understandings regarding disability sport.

He has won seven medals at three Games from 1996 to 2004. Personal Homann was born with cerebral palsy on 16 February 1960 in the Victorian town of Yallourn. When he was three, his father, a pharmacist, moved the family to the New Guinean town of Wewak, where he ran the local pharmacy. In a 2000 interview, Homann said of his childhood in the town: He moved to Melbourne to finish high school and university, and later lived in the United Kingdom for four years, where he took up cycling recreationally. He continued cycling when he moved back to Australia, and was interested in the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics.

The first church on the site was established in the 7th century by St Nidan, the confessor of the monastery at Penmon, Anglesey, but the oldest parts of the present structure, are now closed and partly ruined, date from the 14th century. In about 1500 the church was enlarged by the addition of a second nave on the north side, separated from the earlier nave by an arcade of six arches. During 1839 till 1843 a new church was built nearby to serve the local community, partly due to the cost of repairing the old church. Much of the building was subsequently demolished, leaving only part of the western end and the central arcade. The decision was condemned at the time by Harry Longueville Jones, a clergyman and antiquarian, who lamented the \\"melancholy fate\\" of what he called \\"one of the largest and most important [churches] in the island of Anglesey\\". Other appreciative comments have been made about the church both before and after its partial demolition. After that a new church was opened, the old church was used as a chapel for funerals for a period of time. It has been restored by the owners of the adjoining house, Plas Llanidan, and is occasionally open to the public. The remaining parts of the church are a Grade II* listed building, a national designation given to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\", in particular because St Nidan's is regarded as \\"a good example of a simple medieval rural church, enriched by 15th-century additions\\". In the 12th century, Gerald of Wales said that the church possessed a curious stone carving similar to a thigh that would always return by the next day no matter how far away it was taken. A Norman earl, he recounted, had chained it to a large rock and thrown it into the sea, only for the stone to return to the church by the following morning. A sandstone chest containing bone fragments, possibly are relics of a saint, were found buried beneath the altar. The chest and the church's 13th-century font were relocated to the new church. History and location =Foundation and construction= St Nidan's Church is in the south of Anglesey, Wales, near the village of Brynsiencyn. It is about a quarter of a mile (400 m) from the Menai Strait, which divides the mainland of Wales from the island of Anglesey. The authors of a 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales record the tradition that a church was first established at this site in 616. St Nidan, who founded the church, was associated with St Seiriol's monastery at Penmon, on the eastern tip of Anglesey, and was the monastery's confessor. The area takes its name from the church: the Welsh word originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and \\"‚Äëidan\\" is a modified form of the saint's name. The church and rectory are mentioned in a charter of 1360 as being owned by the priory at Beddgelert, Gwynedd; earlier records have been lost and therefore the date of the priory's acquisition is unknown. As a result, writes the historian Antony Carr, the reason for the \\"distant community\\" of Augustinians in Beddgelert possessing Llanidan and three other churches in Anglesey cannot now be discovered. Carr notes that the priory also controlled two churches on the other side of the Menai Strait from Llanidan. Ownership of the church was passed down to Henry VIII at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1535. His successor, Elizabeth I, granted the advowson (the right of a patron to choose the parish priest) and the grounds surrounding St Nidan's, including the estate house called Plas Llanidan, to an Edward Downam and a Peter Ashton; thereafter, in the following centuries, the right and the land passed on through sale, on marriage and by bequest into the hands of the Boston family. The remaining part of the south nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from medieval times; the north doorway and tracery (patterns of stonework in the windows) point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged by the addition of a south porch and a second nave to the north. An arcade (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan is one of three examples on the island; the others are St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan. It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of the generosity of a benefactor. =Replacement and demolition= A new church, also dedicated to St Nidan, was built to replace the old one between 1839 and 1843. This was because the old church required considerable repair and the growing population in Brynsiencyn needed a church closer to their village. Much of the structure of the old church was demolished in 1844, leaving only the western end (enclosed by a new wall at the east) and the arcade. Some walling was constructed at the east end of the arcade to help support the arches, but it sank because it was apparently built over a grave. In 1913, the tops of the external arches were covered with asphalt and turf in an attempt to make them more weather-proof. One of the voussoirs in the easternmost arch was replaced at the same time due to its poor condition. The new church, built (according to one 19th-century critic) in a \\"debased barbarous style\\" Parish worship transferred to the new church, along with some of the fittings. The old church was thereafter used as a mortuary chapel for a time. The churchyard continued to be used for burials until 1902. In modern times, the owners of Plas Llanidan have restored the church, and it is used by them as a private chapel. The churchyard is kept locked, but the church and the gardens of Plas Llanidan are occasionally opened to the public. The 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones disputed the need to replace the old church and condemned its \\"melancholy fate\\", describing the reasons for its demise as \\"pretexts\\". In his view the only part of the church that needed repair was the \\"ruinous\\" western end (which had been \\"badly constructed in the first instance\\"), yet this part was saved while the \\"good portions of the building\\" were destroyed. Furthermore, the cost of the new church was more than double the cost of repairs to the medieval church, which could have \\"endure[d] for ages to come\\". He added that it might have been thought to be safe, as it was so close to Lord Boston's house and thus \\"under the shadow of the lord of the domain\\", and he condemned the \\"evil hour\\" in which \\"the ruthless hand of the destroyer was allowed to be lifted against it by those whose first duty it was to see that it took no harm\\". He stated that \\"when buildings, dedicated to God's service by the piety of former ages, are allowed to be treated in this manner by the constituted authorities of the land ... the institutions to which they are attached cannot be expected to find greater favour at the hands of the fickle and ignorant multitude.\\" He also noted that the new church was only a little larger than its predecessor. =People associated with the church= The cleric and antiquarian Henry Rowlands, who wrote a history of Anglesey entitled Mona Antiqua Restaurata, was the vicar of St Nidan's from 1696 until his death in 1723. Thomas Williams, a politician and businessman who became wealthy through copper mining in Anglesey, was buried in the churchyard in 1802, but was reburied at St Tegfan's, Llandegfan, in the 1830s. Isaac Jones, a cleric and translator of theological texts, was a curate of Llanidan and other churches in the vicinity from 1840 until his death in 1850. He is buried in the churchyard of St Nidan's. The sculptor John Gibson (1790‚Äì1866) was the son of William Gibson, the fourth of his family to serve as the parish clerk at St Nidan's. The Gibson family was associated with the church from the early 18th century onwards; the baptism of Grace, daughter of George Gibson, is recorded in the registers in 1708. Architecture and fittings =Structure= The east window of the southern aisle, which reuses some 15th-century tracery, and the exposed woodwork of the roof St Nidan's has two naves or aisles divided by a central arcade, and a porch in the south-west corner. It is wide, the northern nave being about wider than the other. Before the church's partial demolition, the church was long and had a chapel, , on the south side. The walls, about thick, are built from local rubble masonry with a covering of sandstone. The present wall at the east end was added after the rest of the church was demolished. The western wall has been rebuilt and buttresses added to the south side and north-west corner to help support the structure; Jones thought that they dated from the 16th century. The roof above the remaining western section is made from slates. At the top of the west end of the roof above the south aisle, there is a stone bellcote with two bells. The south porch contains a water stoup that was said miraculously never to dry up; the water was traditionally regarded as having healing powers. There is a second entrance on the north side through a 15th-century arched doorway decorated with carved human heads. Two verses from Psalm 84 (in Welsh) are written on the wall above the doorway: \\"For one day in thy Courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness.\\" These are the only surviving portions of the Biblical texts that once decorated the internal walls. The north wall has a window with two lights (sections of window separated by mullions) topped with trefoils (a pattern of three overlapping circles). The two arched east windows, one in each aisle, are decorated with tracery; the southern window reuses some tracery from the 15th century. The demolished southern chapel had a two-light window similar to that at St Peter's, Newborough, which Jones considered to be of \\"very rude workmanship\\", and three-light square-headed windows in the east and west walls. Jones also noted the loss of the original window at the end of the northern aisle, which was from the 14th century in his view, and some windows in the north wall \\"of excellent workmanship\\". The southern aisle, he said, had had \\"a small circular headed window, filled up from a pointed one\\" at the eastern end; the east window \\"was of a design more remarkable for its singularity than its beauty.\\" The exposed central arcade, which \\"rises from the graveyard like an abstract sculpture\\" Two of the six arches in the arcade are inside the church; the other four project beyond the east wall, which has been built around one of the octagonal piers that support the arches. The roof dates from the 15th century, although the visible beams are not original; the roof's exposed wooden trusses rest on sandstone corbels. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted 20 memorials from the 17th and 18th centuries. It also recorded the presence of a sundial on a pedestal, dated 1768, and some stone shields that were not attached to the building, bearing dates of 1561 and 1563. Most of the fittings now in St Nidan's are not original, and come from other churches in north-west Wales; the granite altar is modern. =Thigh stone and reliquary= The 19th-century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd, who wrote a history of Anglesey in 1833, recorded the story noted by Gerald of Wales in the late 12th century that the church once possessed a stone \\"resembling a human thigh\\" which would return \\"of its own accord\\" however far away it was carried. It was sometimes known as the \\"homing stone\\". Gerald said that Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester (who died in 1101) had tested this story by throwing the stone into the sea, chained to a large rock, only to discover that the stone had returned by the next morning. As a result, the Norman earl issued an order that no-one was to attempt to move it. It was popularly believed that if a couple had sexual intercourse near the stone (something that Gerald said happened \\"frequently\\"), it would \\"sweat large drops of water\\" and the woman would not become pregnant. Henry Rowlands wrote that the stone had been stolen from the wall of the churchyard (into which it had been set) during his time at St Nidan's. When Rowlands was vicar of St Nidan's, a small chest was found buried about under the altar, containing some bone pieces. His view was that it contained the relics of a saint from St Nidan's or another church in the region (St Beuno's Church, Clynnog Fawr or St Dwynwen's Church, Llanddwyn), and that the chest had placed in St Nidan's during the time of Edward VI for safe keeping. The sandstone reliquary is now kept at the new church, where local tradition maintains that it holds the remains of St Nidan. Jones said that it was \\"unique, as far as Wales is concerned.\\" The 13th- century font, which Jones described as \\"a singularly beautiful specimen\\", was moved to the new church in about 1860. Assessment =Listing= St Nidan's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it is a Grade II* listed building, the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is regarded as \\"a good example of a simple medieval rural church, enriched by 15th-century additions.\\" Cadw, the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists, also notes that although it was partly demolished in the middle of the 19th century, \\"what remains can be considered a well preserved and important survival of a double-naved church, retaining many 15th-century features such as the central arcade.\\" The wall around the churchyard is also a listed building, at Grade II ‚Äì the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". According to Cadw, the wall probably dates from the 15th century, from around the time that the church was extended. =Pre-demolition comments= John Skinner's drawing of the church from 1802 In 1802 the clergyman and antiquarian John Skinner visited Anglesey to see the island's Celtic remains, beginning his tour by rowing across the Menai Strait to land at Llanidan. His view was that the church \\"seems superior to the generality of Welsh buildings of the kind\\", with its double roof and two bells, but he also said that \\"the interior of the building has little to attract notice\\". Angharad Llwyd described it in 1833 as \\"a spacious structure, containing several good monuments\\". Commenting in 1846 on the church as it had been before demolition started, Harry Longueville Jones said that St Nidan's was \\"one of the largest and most important [churches] in the island of Anglesey\\" for its varied architecture, fittings and traditions. He noted the \\"rather curious\\" position of the church, in a \\"nearly circular enclosure\\" with tall trees around it, and said that \\"the effect of the western end with the porch, overgrown by an enormous quantity of ivy, was picturesque in the extreme\\". =Post-demolition comments= The interior, looking from the south-west corner, showing two of the arches separating the aisles The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1850. He said that St Nidan's, which he described as \\"now abandoned and in great measure ruinated\\", was \\"a larger and better structure than most of the Anglesey churches.\\" At the time he saw it, the walls were still largely in place but the only roofed section was the western end; he commented that most of the church was \\"open to the skies.\\" The historian and clergyman Edmund Tyrrell Green, writing a survey of Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929, described the arcade as \\"good\\" and some of the tracery in the windows as \\"very good\\". His view was that the \\"excellence of the work\\" at St Nidan's was because of its link with Beddgelert Priory. The authors of a 1990 book about the lost churches of Wales said that St Nidan's was \\"now an evocative shell decorously mantled with ivy and enclosed by an overgrown graveyard\\". They described it as \\"a dark, dusty and empty place\\", but said that the \\"elegant\\" arcade \\"rises from the graveyard like an abstract sculpture.\\" The quality of the stone carving of the doors and windows, they said, was evidence of \\"the vanished splendour of Llanidan.\\" A 2002 book about Welsh churchyards comments that \\"a pilgrimage undertaken to this churchyard is rewarding\\", since there is \\"little to distract and much to suggest the quiet years of Nidan's ministry in this secluded spot.\\" Noting how the site can be reached from the Menai Strait yet hidden from it, the author added that \\"some stillness still remains in secret places like Llanidan.\\" A 2005 guide to Wales said that \\"the romantic yew-encircled ruin\\" of St Nidan's \\"should not be missed.\\" References External links * Llanidan Old Llanidan Old Category:Church ruins in Wales Category:14th-century church buildings in Wales Category:Llanidan Category:Grade II* listed ruins in Wales Category:Scheduled monuments in Anglesey ","title":"Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan"},{"id":"33247089","text":"Kerry Joan Modra (; born 27 November 1973) is an Australian Paralympic tandem cycling pilot.

It is a tiny, compact, blue-green evergreen succulent perennial, that is native to the Western Cape, South Africa. Listed as Vulnerable on IUCN's global Red List, it is threatened in its natural habitat, but is also widely popular as an ornamental plant in rockeries and desert gardens worldwide.Bornman, H. & Hardy, D.S. 1971. Aloes of South African veld. Voortrekkerspress, Johannesburg. As it requires winter heat, in temperate regions it is grown under glass or as a houseplant. Distribution In the wild, this diminutive species is completely confined to the dry clay soil of ‚ÄúR√ªens Shale Renosterveld‚Äù ‚Äì a critically endangered and rapidly disappearing vegetation type. Small populations are normally found growing on inaccessible rocky slopes and cliffs, especially near the coast, but it is thought that these are merely relics of what was once a much wider distribution. There are several subspecies, which are now separated from each other by farmland and other development. Appearance Aloe brevifolia var. depressa, the larger western variety. Though only 10 cm in height, the Kleinaalwyn tends to sprout suckers from its sides that become new rosettes. Consequently, it can form large clumps. The leaves are short and fat and edged with soft, harmless, white teeth. In fact, the name \\"brevifolia\\" means \\"short-leaf\\" in Latin. The plant is also distinctive for its gray-blue color. In November it sends up a (relatively) tall inflorescence with bright red flowers.Smith, G.F. & Van Wyk, B. 2008. Aloes in Southern Africa. Struik, Cape Town. Cultivation This dwarf aloe is increasingly popular as an ornamental plant for pots and rockeries. In cultivation it should be planted in a reasonably sunny position, in well-drained soil. It requires only moderate watering and should not be kept perpetually damp. It should be remembered that it is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the Western Cape, with its winter rainfall regime. It can be propagated easily by simply removing and replanting the branching suckers. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

He later settled in Helidon, near Brisbane in Queensland, Australia where he became a director of the Helidon Spa Water Company. In 1959, the company merged with Owen Gardener & Sons to become Kirks. Family and education Primrose was born at Dalmeny, near Edinburgh, the third of the six sons of the Hon. Bouverie Francis Primrose (1813‚Äì1898) and his wife, Frederica Sophia Anson (1814‚Äì1867). His father was the son of Archibald Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery and Harriett Bouverie. His mother was the daughter of Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson and Lady Anne Margaret Coke. His brothers included Francis Archibald, (born 1843), Henry William (1846‚Äì1923), who became chairman of the Board of the Inland Revenue, and George Anson Primrose (1849‚Äì1930), who became a vice- admiral. Primrose was baptised at St. John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh and educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond between 1858 and 1865, where he played in the school's cricket XI. On 13 May 1893, in Brisbane, Queensland, he married Jessie Catherine Costelloe, daughter of Lieutenant Costelloe of Lackeen Castle, Birr, Ireland. Football career On 25 February 1871, Primrose (a member of the Civil Service club) was selected as a late replacement for William Baillie-Hamilton for the international football match against England. (In some contemporary match reports, he is listed as \\"C.E. Primrose\\".The Scotsman Newspaper Monday 27 February 1871 page 7) The match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw with goals from Charles Nepean and Robert Walker. In many present-day databases, Primrose is confused with his elder brother, Henry, who played for Scotland on 19 November 1870. Helidon Spa Water Company Brisbane premises of the Helidon Spa Water Co., 1899Primrose later emigrated to Queensland, Australia where his brother Francis had already settled. In January 1871, Francis is listed as having made a \\"pre-emptive selection\\" of 264 acres of agricultural land at Emu Creek, about 17 miles north of Crows Nest. The quality of the water at Helidon had long been known to the indigenous population who claimed that their strength came from the water. In 1879, chemist Reginald Larard was selling water from the spring as \\"Oogar Dang Water\\", and by 1881 had entered a partnership with Gilbert Primrose who, had purchased the agricultural land around the springs, establishing the Helidon Spa Water Company. When Larard left, Primrose became managing director of the company. Describing that the former partnership \\"had expired by effluxion of time\\", this led Primrose to seek new investors in a proposed limited company. In October 1885, a special train was laid to transport potential investors from Brisbane to view the springs and taste its water, described as \\"full of sparkling effervescence and perfectly clear\\". Concerns over breakages led the company to start transporting the water from Helidon to a new bottling factory in Brisbane. In October 1895 Primrose sued a Jean de Raeve for an unpaid debt of ¬£19 0s. 7d due to the company. The company's success was such that competitors were frequently taken to court for breach of copyright. In May 1897, Primrose successfully took action against Alfred Lucas Gardner, trading as \\"Owen Gardner and Sons\\" who had been selling soft drinks in Brisbane since 1850, for \\"infringement of his patent rights in connection with the sale of Helidon Spa water\\". This prevented Gardner and Sons from using the words 'Helidon' or 'Spa Water' on their bottles or advertisements, until a similar suit against Edward Campbell of the 'Brisbane Aerated Water Company' was appealed and the rules were relaxed. To compete with competition from imported products, Helidon Spa Water Company and Owen Gardner & Sons merged in 1959 to become Helidon Gardner Pty Ltd, trading under the name Kirk's, named for Owen Garner & Sons flagship product \\"Kirk's Ginger Ale\\". Brisbane bottler, Tristrams was also invited to take part in the merger, but declined. Today, Kirks is owned by Coca-Cola Amatil, and continue to produce a variety of soft drinks available Australia wide. Later life During his time in Queensland, Primrose became a captain in the Queensland Scottish Rifles and the Queensland Defence Force, and was also a JP. In May 1899, Primrose was appointed to represent Queensland at the \\"Greater Britain Exhibition\\" to be held at Earls Court, London. In October 1900, Primrose and his family published a notice in The \\"Sydney Morning Herald\\", thanking \\"their many kind friends and sympathisers for wreaths and letters of sympathy received during their recent sad bereavement\\". In 1909, Primrose returned to England where he died at Worthing, West Sussex on 16 February 1935.

History On 15 December 1981, Dreamworld officially opened to the public with Avis Vintage Cars as one of the original attractions. John Longhurst had purchased fourteen replicas of Model T Fords at a price of $12,000 each, to create the ride. The Avis Vintage Cars were originally part of Rivertown until early 2007 when they were relocated to their current location in Dreamworld Corroboree. Ride The ride consists of 4 people boarding one of fourteen replicas of 1911 Ford Model T cars. The acceleration of the car is controlled by a driver in the front while the steering is controlled by a single, steel guide rail on the cement roadway below. The steering wheel has no effect on the direction of the vehicle. In the early 2000s roofs were added to the fleet of vintage cars. Layouts =1981‚Äì1997= The original layout was a simple figure 8. The track began with a right hand turn out of the station before going underneath a bridge.

It then turned left and travelled alongside the Murrissippi River before running parallel to the Dreamworld Railway tracks and circling the base of the Dreamworld Tower. It then returned over that bridge and into the station. Despite the addition to the circuit, the original track remained intact and allowed both routes to operate through the use of a switch track. This extended layout was primarily utilised from 1997 until 2007, however, the original circuit was utilised for a short period of time during one Xtremeworld event. =2007‚Äìpresent= In 2007, in preparation of the construction of Mick Doohan's Motocoaster, the Avis Vintage Cars were relocated to Dreamworld Corroboree.

The facility is the largest of its kind in the United States and has a population of almost 800 aged and disabled veterans of World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, War in Afghanistan, and Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom. Several levels of care are offered to residents, including domiciliary services, residential care for the elderly, intermediate nursing care, skilled nursing care, adult day health care, and outpatient clinic. The grounds of the facility include the 1,214 seat Lincoln Theater (home of Symphony Napa Valley, Orchestra Institute Napa Valley as well as a robust education program), a 9-hole golf course, baseball stadium, bowling alley, swimming pool, U.S. Post Office, and a military base exchange branch store. All of these facilities are available for use by resident veterans at no additional cost. Additionally, the home offers services specifically for residents including a fitness center, a resident operated television station, auto hobby shop, a 35,000 volume library, creative arts center, and a multi-faith chapel. A cemetery on the grounds holds the graves of more than 5,500 veterans and their spouses dating back to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. Founding In 1877, the Grand Army of the Republic first secured land in San Francisco for a veterans home; however, the property was deemed not appropriate. The separate group advocating for a California Veteran's Home was officially founded on March 7, 1882. On October 25, 1882, after a successful fundraising campaign and a thorough investigation of alternative sites, the committee purchased a 910 acre site near Yountville, California for $17,750. Since 1883, the State of California had provided partial funding of $15,000 per year, under the assumption that this allocation would support 100 veterans. The home opened to its first residents on April 1, 1884. The institution was governed by a 11 member board, two from the Association of Mexican War Veterans, and nine from the Grand Army of the Republic representing Union Civil War Veterans. The California Veteran's Home was recognized as an official state institution in 1889. There were 17 residents when the home opened, but by the end of 1891, the population had grown to 408 men. In the decade that followed its founding, both the Veterans Home and the Napa Valley struggled through difficult financial times until a private association was formed and was responsible for the home. It secured funding from both the state of California and the federal government, but in 1896 Washington determined that it could no longer fund a privately operated facility and withdrew its financial support. The association had no choice but to turn the Veterans Home over to the state of California in 1897. The state paid the association $20 and officially changed the name to the Veterans Home of California at Yountville. At the time the state took over the home, it had an estimated value of $320,000 and consisted of 55 steam heated buildings with electric lighting, running water and a sewer system. The grounds also had a successful dairy, hog farm, and chicken ranch and was the home for 800 veterans of the Mexican, Civil, and Indian wars. Early 20th Century Col. Nelson M. Holderman, a World War I veteran and recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, was appointed commandant of the home in 1919. Although this combat-hardened soldier would fight many bureaucratic battles on behalf of the home, his biggest challenge would come from the Civil War veterans at the home and on its board who resisted changes he was advocating. Not wanting a confrontation with these old vets, he resigned as commandant in 1921, vowing to return. After several members passed from the board, Col. Holderman returned to his position as commandant in 1926 and remained there until his death in 1953. He is generally credited with a revitalization of the Veterans Home that can be seen and felt until today. Holderman was able to overcome many political and bureaucratic roadblocks during his tenure and he replaced and remodeled many of the run-down administrative and residential buildings, as well as planted the now mature grove of towering trees from around the world, known as Holderman‚Äôs Grove. Significantly, in 1929, he was also able to oversee the construction of a 500-bed hospital that the home had needed for years. Late 20th Century In the 1970s, the home faced another financial crisis. Decreased funding was having a degrading effect on facilities and staffing, to the point that the future of the home was in question. The California Health and Human Services Agency and United States Department of Health and Human Services were both threatening to withdraw certification from the home. The California State Legislature took action, approving a $100 million renovation master plan, reinforcing California's commitment, of over 100 years, to its veterans. left The 1918 Armistice Chapel was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as NRIS #79000510. 21st Century leftMore than halfway through the renovation program, the Veterans' Home of California at Yountville is home to almost 1,200 veterans, including almost 150 women veterans and nearly 30 couples. The home's director Donald Veverka took over the position in 2014 and was dismissed in 2017. Veterans share their input and recommendations through the Veterans' Home Allied Council, an official advisory body to the administrator. The home's annual operating budget is $47 million, half of which is provided by the California general fund; the remainder by other sources, including federal reimbursements and member fees. The Veterans' Home of California Yountville continues to enjoy tremendous support from citizens, service clubs and veterans organizations throughout the state. Their help makes many of the services provided by the home possible in a time of increasing fiscal problems at the state level. The home is a focal point for service organizations, including AMVETS, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans and The American Legion, to name a few of the most active, who represent thousands of veterans throughout the state and make their presence felt at the home. The Home, nestled in the verdant Wine Country of northern California, also houses the alternate seat of government for the governor's office and shares that duty with another state facility at Fresno. The Home was the primary filming location for the 2014 documentary film, Of Men and War. The film documented the work of The Pathway Home, a residential treatment program meant to help post-9/11 veterans struggling with PTSD and TBIs reintegrate into society. On March 9, 2018, the entire facility was placed on lockdown after reports of gunfire. A shooter took three hostages, employees of The Pathway Home. Shortly thereafter, the gunman killed all three hostages and then himself. The Napa Valley Register reported that the suspect had been discharged recently from a veterans' treatment program at The Pathway Home.

Hell Gap complex bones and tools artifacts at the site are carbon dated from about ca. 8000-8050 BC.Kipfer, p. 266. Geography The Jones-Miller site is located in Yuma County, Colorado, 10 miles from the town of Laird in the Republican River basin.Wedel, p. 65. The grassland site is located at a deep draw that drains into an Arikaree River tributary.Gibbon, Ames, pp. 400-401. History =Background= Within the Denver Basin, prehistoric time periods are traditionally identified as: Paleo-Indian, Archaic and Ceramic (Woodland) periods.Nelson, pp. 7, 65. The Denver basin is a geological definition of a portion of the Colorado Piedmont from Colorado Springs to Wyoming and west to Kansas and Nebraska. The Palmer Divide, with elevations from 6,000 to 7,500, is a subsection of that area that separates the South Platte River watershed from that of the Arkansas River.Nelson, pp. 7, 21, 33. It runs perpendicular to the Rocky Mountains and divides the Denver metropolitan area from the southern Pikes Peak area.Nelson, Laubach. The period immediately preceding the first humans coming into Colorado was the Ice Age Summer of about 16,000 years ago. Large mammals, such as the mastodon, mammoth, camelops, giant sloths, cheetah, bison antiquus and horses roamed the land. There were a few Paleo-Indian cultures, distinctive by the size of the tools they used and the animals they hunted. People in the first Paleo-Indian period, the Clovis complex period, had large tools to hunt the megafauna animals.Waldman, 5. By 11,000 years ago (9,000 BC), the climate warmed and lakes and savannas receded. The land became drier, food became less abundant, and as a result of the giant animals became extinct. Receding and melting glaciers created the Plum and Monument Creeks, created the Castle Rock mesas and unburied the Rocky Mountains. People adapted by hunting smaller mammals and gathering wild plants to supplement their diet.Griffin-Pierce, p. 130. A new cultural complex was born, the Folsom tradition, with smaller projectile points to hunt smaller animals.Johnson, p. 30. Aside from hunting smaller mammals, people adapted by gathering wild plants to supplement their diet. The Lindenmeier Site, the largest known Paleo-Indian Folsom site,Gantt, 1. contained artifacts of the Paleo-Indians who lived and hunted in the present Fort Collins area approximately 11,000 years ago. Some of the artifacts are identified from people of the Folsom tradition, named for the Folsom Site in New Mexico, and identified as such by the Folsom points used for hunting the large, now extinct Bison antiquus. They likely also gathered food in the area, such as seeds, nuts and seasonal fruits. They were nomadic people, following the bison herds, and camping many places each year.Buccholtz, Chapter 1.Local History Archive. =Paleo-Indian Folsom site= Robert Jones, Jr., a rancher in the Wray, Colorado area, found bones and projectile points near his home in 1972. Jack Miller, a local anthropologist, performed a test site excavation and found bones and Paleo-Indian artifacts. Dennis Stanford, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution, was contacted and a full-scale excavation of the Jones Miller site was performed between 1973 and 1978Cassells, p. 79. of what is primarily a bison kill site. Waldo Rudolph Wedel said in 1986 that it was the \\"most carefully studied bison kill\\" site. Example of a draw. Archaeologists learned how early native people may have hunted large prey from the artifacts at the Jones-Miller site. Remains of 300 bison were found in an arroyo, or draw, above the Arikaree River basin. It was believed that the bison were strategically driven into an area difficult for the bison to traverse and easier to kill on three occasions. Because many of the animals were nursing calves, it is estimated that the kills occurred in late fall or winter.Folsom Traditions 9,000 - 8,000 BC. The bones from the bison kill were piled into many stacks, indicating that there were several butcher sites.Gibbon, Ames, p. 401. Artifacts found at the site include Hell Gap complex projectile points and flakes, knives, scrapers and tools made of bone. While there is little evidence to determine the extent to which Paleo-Indians practiced religion, artifacts grouped together at the Jones-Miller site are like that of historic northern Plains people's medicine post ceremony where, among the bison bones were placed a projectile point, dog remains and an antler flute. The practice is similar to that of the Cree and Assiniboine people. The site is dated at 10,020 +/- 320 years before present, or about 8000 BC. It is the only Hell Gap (Wyoming) site in Colorado.Cassells, pp. 79-80 =Collection= The collection of artifacts from the Smithsonian Institution's excavation in the 1970s was donated to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in 1997. The collection, called the \\"Jones-Miller Hell Gap Bison Kill Site Collection,\\" contains bison bones, projectile points and stone tools.Colwell, Nash, Holen, PT75.

He was a √©toile (star dancer) of the Paris Opera Ballet for 23 years. Since September 1, 2010, he has directed the Vienna State Ballet. He will assume the position of artistic director of La Scala Theatre Ballet in December 2020. Manuel Legris at the last stage in the Paris Opera Ballet  Biography  = Career as a dancer = He started ballet lessons at the age of 8 under a local ballet teacher, Yvonne Guba. In 1976 at age 11, he started with the Paris Opera Ballet School and joined the Corps de Ballet at 16 years old in 1980. In 1981 he became \\"Coryphee\\", and was then promoted to \\"Sujet\\" in 1982. Exceptionally, Manuel Legris was appointed to the title \\"Etoile\\" on 11 July 1986, at age 21, by the Stage Director Rudolf Nureyev, bypassing the rank of \\"Premier Danseur.\\" On that day, the company performed Raymonda, choreographed by Nureyev, at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and Legris danced the leading role of Jean de Brienne. At the end of the performance, he was named the principal dancer on the stage. The succession of roles allowed him to become the new star developing a \\"large repertoire\\", revealing the many facets of his extensive gifts. In addition to his intrinsic qualities of flawless technique and expressive richness, Manuel Legris established himself as an outstanding partner, a complete dancer equally at home with the classical and the contemporary repertoires. Thus, William Forsythe, John Neumeier, Jiri Kylian and Jerome Robbins alike, the most renowned choreographers continued to engage him: Manuel Legris participated in most entries to the repertoire or the creations of the Paris Opera. At the same time, the reputation of the dancer crossed the borders very quickly. Manuel Legris was invited by the most prestigious companies, such as the Royal Ballet in London, the New York City Ballet, the Cuban National Ballet, the Tokyo Ballet, the Ballets of Monte- Carlo, Stuttgart and Hamburg where John Neumeier created especially for him Spring and Fall and A Cinderella Story. As the permanent guest dancer, Manuel Legris appeared on all the prestigious stages of the world, La Scala in Milan, the Met in New York, the Vienna State Opera Ballet, the Bolshoi in Moscow, and most recently he performed several times at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. Manuel Legris soon established himself as a sought-after partner, and in addition to the etoiles of the Paris Opera, he performed with the greatest dancers of the world, including Evelyn Hart, Dominique Khalfoun, Alessandra Ferri, Lorna Feijoo and Diana Vishneva. In addition, Manuel Legris traveled the world with his fellow dancers, \\"Manuel Legris et ses √âtoiles.\\" This concept was born in 1996 with the collaboration of Manuel Legris and Monique Loudi√®res. There wishes were to allow young dancers to approach the solo roles still inaccessible for them at the Opera, and to enable them to work with leading choreographers forcing them to perform against the young artists. The group was regularly invited to Japan. In January 2000, during a tour in Tokyo, Kishin Shinoyama, a successful Japanese photographer, published a photo book Manuel Legris A L'Opera de Paris, a book dedicated to him. In 2003, Manuel Legris added two major works to his repertoire: Variations on Carmen by Roland Petit and Phrases of Quartet by Maurice B√©jart. That same year, Maurice B√©jart staged again The Song of a Wayfarer for him and Laurent Hilaire, giving them the exclusive performance. In February 2004, Jiri Kylian created a Pas de Deux Il faut qu'une porte... at the Paris Opera where Manuel Legris danced with Aur√©lie Dupont. During the summer, he made another triumphant tour in Japan with his group, to which he added \\"special guests\\" Monique Loudi√®res and Laurent Hilaire. Finally, in December he took part in the new work of Trisha Brown O zlozony / O composite, along with Aur√©lie Dupont and Nicolas Le Riche. In December 2005, the Stuttgart Ballet offered him the title role in Onegin where he danced with Maria Eichwald and the company during a tour of Japan and in January 2006 in Stuttgart. On November 19, 2007, he danced as the partner of Doroth√©e Gilbert, his favorite pupil of the dance school, in the Nutcracker at the Opera de Paris, which was performed without any costumes or set (due to strikes by staff), after which she was named Etoile. He made his official farewell from the stage of the Opera Garnier on May 15, 2009, with the principal role of Onegin (for this exceptional performance, he requested the traditional D√©fil√© of students and dancers in the Opera). Among the partners, Clairemarie Osta, Mathias Heymann and Myriam Ould-Braham were found on stage while he was applauded from the hall by numerous Etoiles of the House, former ballet masters such as Claude Bessy and Pierre Lacotte, and the Culture and Communication Minister Christine Albanel. He received a standing ovation from the entire audience for nearly half an hour. On this occasion he was awarded the insignia of \\"Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\\" = After official farewell = Manuel Legris continued to dance for a few months, especially abroad, before taking the reins of the Vienna State Ballet in September 2010. He brought to the company a number of ballets, including ‚Äì for the 2010/2011 season ‚Äì Rudolf Nureyev's Don Quixote, Onegin, and a Triple Bill devoted to Jerome Robbins already performed in Paris. Since September 1, 2010, he has directed the Vienna State Ballet. In 2017, Legris announced he would step down once his contract ran out in 2020. In February 2020, Legris announced he will assume the position of artistic director of La Scala Theatre Ballet in December 2020.

Initial British and American air raids Consolidated B-24 Liberators in formation Model of Thai (RTAF) Nakajima Ki-43 Allied bombing raids on the Thai capital city of Bangkok began even before Thailand had declared war, since the Empire of Japan was using the country as a staging area for its invasions of both Malaya and Burma, with the reluctant agreement of the Thai government after Japan's successful invasion of the southeast Asian country on 8 December 1941. The first raid came on 7 January 1942, when Royal Air Force (RAF) aircraft flying from Rangoon, attacked military targets in the city.RAF hits Bangkok, Evening Post, Volume CXXXIII, Issue 7, 9 January 1942, Page 5http://113squadron.com/id120.htm Burma - Air Operations, Jan 1st to May 22, 1942, Air-Vice-Marshal D.

The second night raid was carried out by eight Blenheims on 24‚Äì25 January and included No. 60 Squadron RAF aircrew.Thai Capital Plastered, The Western Australian, Perth, 26 Jan 1942, page 3 A final raid was made three days later by four Blenheims. This was the last raid by Blenheims until May or June 1945. The British and American bombings were also aided by the Free Thai Movement, an Allied-aligned, anti-Japanese guerilla movement. Agents of the Free Thai Movement designated targets for Allied planes and locations of Japanese positions and even reported on the weather over the targets. After Rangoon fell to the Japanese on 7 March, heavy bombers, such as the RAF and American Tenth Air Force Consolidated B-24 Liberators, based in India and China, attacked targets in Thailand.Jap oil refinery destroyed, The Canberra Times, 28 November 1942, page 2Support from Siam, Evening Post, Volume CXXXV, Issue 3, 5 January 1943, Page 5 The raids were carried out because Bangkok by then had become a command centre for the Japanese on the Southeast Asian front. RAF and USAAF bombers carried out the raids as part of the Pacific campaigns. The bombers struck installations used by the occupying Japanese military, but the raids were also intended to pressure the government of Thai military strongman Plaek Pibulsongkram to abandon his unpopular alliance with Imperial Japan. The major targets were the newly completed Port of Bangkok and the Thai railway system. Raids by RAF, USAAF, and other Allied air forces continued with growing intensity from India, and after the liberation of Rangoon on 3 May 1945, from Rangoon until the end of the war in August that year. Blenheim bombers and Mustangs operated out of Rangoon against Bangkok in this later phase of the bombing. First B-29 Superfortress combat mission Boeing B-29 Superfortress In its first combat mission, the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress was used by the XX Bomber Command's 58th Air Division to strike targets in Bangkok, before it was deployed against the Japanese home islands.Bombers Over Japan, Evening Post, Volume CXXXVII, Issue 142, 17 June 1944, Page 7 The decision to use the B-29s to bomb Bangkok dated back to 1943 and was mentioned in a communique between US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in which Roosevelt suggested that they be used to bomb the port and railways.R-418/9 memo, Churchill and Roosevelt - The Complete Correspondence - II Alliance Forged, Warren F Kimball, Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 1984, page 617 On 5 June 1944, 98 B-29s led by the 58th's commander, General LaVerne Saunders, flew from airfields in India to attack the Makasan railway yards in Bangkok. A 2,261 mile round trip, the raid was the longest mission to date in the war. Only 77 of the B-29s made it to Bangkok, 21 others having had to turn back because of engine problems. Reaching the Thai capital at about 11:00, the bombers found their targets obscured by bad weather. The B-29s were meant to drop their bombs from between 22,000 and 25,000 feet, but instead released their bombs at between 17,000 and 27,000 feet. Only 18 bombs hit their intended targets. The others destroyed a Japanese military hospital and damaged the Japanese secret police headquarters. On their return to India, 42 of the B-29s had to divert to other airfields because of a lack of fuel. Five of these crashed on landing. Further raids were carried out by the Superfortresses against strategic targets in Bangkok.Strike Tokio Again, Evening Post, Volume CXXXVIII, Issue 129, 28 November 1944, Page 5 Temporary British occupation At the end of the hostilities, British and Indian military forces arrived in Bangkok to disarm and repatriate the surrendered Japanese. On 9 September 1945, the RAF set up its headquarters under Group Captain Don Finlay of the RAF's 909 Wing at Bangkok's Don Muang airfield. Three RAF squadrons were represented in Siam during the brief occupation: No. 20 Squadron RAF with Spitfire VIII aircraft, No. 211 Squadron RAF with de Havilland Mosquito VI aircraft, and a detachment of No. 685 Squadron RAF with Mosquito photo-reconnaissance aircraft. The airfield was defended by No. 2945 Squadron, RAF Regiment. Almost all the RAF units had left by January 1946.

The reeds were originally manufactured for American style suction reed organs being manufactured in Germany on machinery that was bought second hand in Chicago in the United States and imported to Germany by Karl Mannborg son of Theodor Mannborg. Mannborg owned the factory in Pegau, Germany supplying organ parts for American style suction reed organs. Germany (and later in England) was the only country in Europe that was manufacturing American style suction reed organs while the rest of the reed organ industry in Europe was making pressure reed Harmoniums. Indian harmoniums In the 1930s and 1940s the demand in Europe for reed organs and harmoniums significantly declined and the factory started exporting the reeds to India where Indian style hand-pumped harmoniums had become very popular creating the demand and a market for the German harmonium reeds. Although these organ reeds were originally designed and manufactured for American style suction organs they became the favored reeds for their tone quality and tuning stability in Indian hand pumped harmoniums which work on an air pressure system. In order for them to be attached to the Indian harmonium reed board (as opposed to sliding into the reed chambers as they did on the reed organs) holes were drilled at the top tongue end of the reed casing and a notch was drilled at the base end. This enabled the German reeds to be screwed directly and tightly onto the reed board with the reed tongue over the air holes connected to the playing keys. Subsequently, the factory began selling the reed sets labeled as Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch and several other branded names as Harmonium Brass Reeds Made in Germany with the screw holes already drilled in the outer reed casing to suit the Indian harmonium market. The distinguishing visual features of the German Jubilate reeds are the words Jubilate, Harmola or Monarch (and other branding names) and Made in Germany which are stamped on each individual reed in addition to the pitch of the reed and the distinct rounded bottom edge of the casing at the tongue end of the reed. There were also German reeds that were stamped with only \\"Made in Germany\\" and some were stamped only with the note/pitch of the reed. The latter version with the note/pitch stamp only can be identified by the distinct rivet structure securing the reed tongue on the German reeds which is the mostly the same on all versions of these reeds made on the same machinery in Germany. There is debate that the reeds branded 'Harmola' were made on a different machine elsewhere TBD. Most of the German reeds used in the Indian style harmoniums do not have the typical reed tongue shaping for the voicing of the reeds found in American or German style suction organs. There are also German Jubilate branded reeds that are the typical square casing design of harmonium reeds and very rare to find and prized. There have been considerable attempts to find out when this design was made in relation to the typical German rounded casing at the tongue end. End of German Jubilate reed production In the early 1960s the factory making the German organ reeds used in the Indian sub-continent for harmoniums, having changed hands several times and now situated in post World War II East Germany (GDR), was taken over by the communist government and the reed making machinery was scrapped. This marked the end of German reed production. In the late 1970s India had also issued a ban on the importing of any German harmonium reeds to boost sales and promote the production of harmonium reeds being made in India. As a result, the demand and the value of the German reeds increased as did the scarcity of availability although they were still exported to Pakistan which was not using Indian harmonium reeds because or trade restrictions between the two countries. Today German reeds are highly prized and sought after by players of Indian harmoniums in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh as well as around the globe. Notable recordings Some of the most notable recordings of the classic, clear and distinct tone of German harmonium reeds can be heard on the harmonium playing of the late Farukkh Fateh Ali Khan, brother and lead harmonium accompanist of the late Qawwali legend Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan from Pakistan. It is common practice in Pakistani Sufi Qawwali circles that a serious Qawwali harmonium player must have German reeds in their harmoniums. Reed configuration The typical German Jubilate reed configuration in Pakistani Qawwali harmoniums is one bank of Bass (8') reeds starting on C and a bank of Male (4') reeds (octaves apart) starting on C that sound together on one note being played with an engaged (most often permanently) right action octave coupler (a mechanism located under the keyboard that simultaneously couples and plays the same note/key an octave higher with the lower note or notes being played on the harmonium to create a strong and full sound). Often the lowest octave of German Bass (8') reeds is not easily available and is therefore substituted with Indian Delhi style brass reeds for the first bass 12 reeds. One detail to note is that very often German reeds taken from old harmoniums in Kolkata show clear signs of cross filing which is apparently part of voicing the reeds for the tongues to respond faster and require less air to sound. The tone of these voiced reeds is distinctly different from the standard German reeds and closer resembles the tonal quality of Indian reeds yet still being unique in the actual tone. Gallery File:German Jubilate, Harmola and Monarch harmonium reeds.jpgPictured are three German harmonium reeds stamped with the names Jubilate, Harmola and Monarch. These are three 'brands' of German harmonium reeds although 'Jubilate' is probably the most common and there are more brands out there including 'Organa', 'Happy' 'B.B.D' and more. Although the three reeds are from different 'brands' all were built on the same machinery that was imported from the USA to Germany to make brass suction organ reeds which were being made in Germany at that time (There is some doubt about the 'Harmola' reeds being made on the same machine. The holes in the bottom and the notch at the tops of the reeds were drilled later to install them on the reed boards of Indian style harmoniums. File:Size comparison between German harmonium reeds and Indian Delhi style brass harmonium reeds..JPGNote that these are German harmonium reeds that have yet to have the holes and notch drilled. They are simply stamped 'Made in Germany' with no other brand indication. Notice the size differences between the German reeds and Indian reeds of the same pitch. The casing sizes are not retrofit between German and Indian reeds.

He argued \\"childhood\\" as a concept was created by modern society. Ari√®s studied paintings, gravestones, furniture, and school records. He found before the 17th-century, children were represented as mini-adults. Other scholars have emphasized how medieval and early modern child rearing was not indifferent, negligent, nor brutal. Wilson argues that in the context of pre-industrial poverty and high infant mortality (with a third or more of the babies dying), actual child-rearing practices represented appropriate behavior in the circumstances. He points to extensive parental care during sickness, and to grief at death, sacrifices by parents to maximize child welfare, and a wide cult of childhood in religious practice.Stephen Wilson, \\"The myth of motherhood a myth: the historical view of European child-rearing\\", Social History, May 1984, Vol. 9 Issue 2, pp. 181‚Äì198 Playing Children, by Song dynasty Chinese artist Su Hanchen, c. 1150 AD  Preindustrial and medieval  Historians had assumed traditional families in the preindustrial era involved the extended family, with grandparent, parents, children and perhaps some other relatives all living together and ruled by an elderly patriarch. There were examples of this in the Balkans‚Äîand in aristocratic families. However, the typical pattern in Western Europe was the much simpler nuclear family of husband, wife and their children (and perhaps a servant, who might well be a relative). Children were often temporarily sent off as servants to relatives in need of help.King, M. L. \\"Concepts of Childhood: What We Know and Where We Might Go\\", Renaissance Quarterly (2007). . In medieval Europe there was a model of distinct stages of life, which demarcated when childhood began and ended. A new baby was a notable event. Nobles immediately started thinking of a marriage arrangement that would benefit the family. Birthdays were not major events as the children celebrated their saints' day after whom they were named. Church law and common law regarded children as equal to adults for some purposes and distinct for other purposes.Nicholas Orme, Medieval Children (2003) Education in the sense of training was the exclusive function of families for the vast majority of children until the 19th century. In the Middle Ages the major cathedrals operated education programs for small numbers of teenage boys designed to produce priests. Universities started to appear to train physicians, lawyers, and government officials, and (mostly) priests. The first universities appeared around 1100: the University of Bologna in 1088, the University of Paris in 1150, and the University of Oxford in 1167. Students entered as young as 13 and stayed for 6 to 12 years.Olaf Pedersen, The First Universities (1997). Early modern periods In England during the Elizabethan era, the transmission of social norms was a family matter and children were taught the basic etiquette of proper manners and respecting others. Some boys attended grammar school, usually taught by the local priest. During the 1600s, a shift in philosophical and social attitudes toward children and the notion of \\"childhood\\" began in Europe. Adults increasingly saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them. English philosopher John Locke was particularly influential in defining this new attitude towards children, especially with regard to his theory of the tabula rasa, promulgated in his 1690 An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. In Locke's philosophy, tabula rasa was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a \\"blank slate\\" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's sensory experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank, and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasised the importance of providing children with \\"easy pleasant books\\" to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them: \\"children may be cozened into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipped for.\\" During the early period of capitalism, the rise of a large, commercial middle class, mainly in the Protestant countries of Holland and England, brought about a new family ideology centred around the upbringing of children. Puritanism stressed the importance of individual salvation and concern for the spiritual welfare of children. It became widely recognized that children possess rights on their own behalf. This included the rights of poor children to sustenance, membership in a community, education, and job training. The Poor Relief Acts in Elizabethan England put responsibility on each Parish to care for all the poor children in the area.Vivian C. Fox, \\"Poor Children's Rights in Early Modern England,\\" Journal of Psychohistory, Jan 1996, Vol. 23 Issue 3, pp 286‚Äì306 = Childhood in Early Modern England = Throughout the course of the Early Modern Period, childhood was split into multiple sections: adolescence, working and familial jobs, education, and sexual relations and marriage. However, the ages defining these different steps in development were arbitrary. Regardless of the age descriptions of each developmental stage, each person went through these stages in their life. This research will focus on the stages of childhood within early modern England, specifically the mid- sixteenth century through the mid-seventeenth century. Adolescence was a short-lived period in a child's life. Many historians debate this quick transition into adult life. Philippe Ari√®s performed a study on childhood and argued that in theory and practice, adolescence was almost unknown, stating that once a child had reached the age of six or seven, they would become part of the adult world.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 4. Other historians have argued that, ‚Äúadolescence - the blossoming or lustful age...could begin at the age of 9 but also at 14; you could span the years between 14, or 18, and up to 25, 28, or simply until marriage.‚ÄùBen-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 11. It is difficult to properly assess the different stages of childhood because there was no defining moment that signaled the transition between stages. Thus making this arbitrary interpretation a conflict amongst historians. Regardless of this, there are still general categories that are somewhat all-encompassing despite age differences. A wide belief shared amongst theorists describes human instincts as inherently sinful from adolescence, especially in infants, children and youth.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 12. This links to the theory of the Greek physician, Galen. Within his theory, Galenic physiology believed that humans passed through four separate ages, each controlled by a humour.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 16. \\"Small infants were dominated by the blood humour; mature persons were governed by the black choler; and old age by the phlegm. Youth was governed by the red choler, which was also associated with hotness and dryness, with the summer season, and with fire...The notion of youth as a period governed by hot temper, or humour, or fire...could be used to evoke a variety of qualities: boldness, arrogance, excessive activity, rashness, a spirit easily drawn to quarrelling and vengeance, and especially to disobedience, riot, and rebelliousness.\\"Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 17. This aggression and rashness associated with childhood adolescence resulted in a connection with sin in religion. Because of this, parents were responsible for providing their children with ‚Äúconstant and diligent nurturing, strict discipline, and a proper education,\\" as part of the Catholic role in parenthood. Without these, their children would be tempted to do wrong. To add to that, about half of children would die before they reached the age of ten, so parents required strict discipline and hovered from using too much affection, which only increased the children's respect for their parents.Wiesner-Hanks, Merry E. Early Modern Europe 1450-1789 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016), 59. Within multiple autobiographies from the early modern period, authors even admitted to struggling between whether to follow God or Satan's invitations.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994),16. However, most authors reprimanded themselves for having immoral thoughts,Ben- Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 18. and even resulted in an inclination to spiritual practices later in life. Despite how these negative theories correlated with adolescence, sometimes these behaviors were acceptable because the general consensus was that these behaviors would eventually disappear with time. Therefore, not all associations with adolescence were unfavorable. It was important, however, that parents guide their children through these rough stages of adolescence to ensure complete elimination of these tendencies. Children valued their parents‚Äô opinion and blessing,Shanley, Mary Lyndon, The History of the Family in Modern England (Signs 4, no. 4, 1979), 742. thus emphasizing the importance of the parent- child relationship during the stages of adolescence. From a very young age, children were required to help with work within the family; these children were also expected to continue helping the family until they were able or willing to leave the house. As they grew, children were given more physically demanding or harder jobs. To add to that, boys and girls had different tasks growing up that normally fit within tasks they would have to perform later in life. Children did have jobs within the household that they performed year round. This includes, ‚Äúfetching water and gathering sticks for fuel, going on errands, assisting mothers in milking, preparing food, cleaning, washing and mending.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 41. These tasks were dependent on the regions each family lived in; rural families taught children how to spin and card, and some girls were educated in stocking-knitting, hand- knitting, and lacemaking. These were useful skills for urban women to gain as they became popular industries in the 17th century. In other seasons, children performed a myriad of tasks around the property. Younger children helped with harrowing, scaring birds away from corn, pulling weeds, gathering fruits, and spreading dung for food. During the winter, children still assisted their parents by ‚Äúthreshing, stacking sheaves, cleaning the barn and, in places and soils that required it in the winter, ploughing as well.‚Äù By aiding in familial chores, children learned the importance and value in working. Not only was this essential to development, but it provided funds for families that were in poverty. From the sixteenth century to the first half of the seventeenth century, the population of England doubled, reaching 5 million.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 45. As the population grew, so did poverty. Children were more susceptible to poverty, which explains why working was so crucial; if children were not helping they could become an economic burden on their families. Within these responsibilities, there were differences in jobs based on gender. One account recalls that their sister was taught to read, knit, do needle work, and spin.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 42. Not only that, but young girls also assisted in housework with washing, marketing and preparing food. From this, one can infer that these jobs were typically given to women as this correlated with tasks they would be performing later in life. Preparing children with the information they needed to succeed in life was one of the many responsibilities parents‚Äô held.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 66. Education was significantly different for men and women in England. Living in a patriarchal society, men had societal advantages which included a stable education for the majority of their early life. Women, on the other hand, were typically educated in more remedial tasks that would assist them in being homemakers or having basic jobs. For men, their education primarily consisted of preparing them for future careers in diverse fields.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 133. Professions associated with ‚Äúhigher learning, the church, law, medicine, business and crafts, military service, the Navy and husbandry,‚Äù were deemed appropriate for men. The number of schools greatly increased in the seventeenth century, providing more access for elementary and higher education.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 55. These were typically boarding schools, but there were women scattered around the country that taught basic reading and literacy to families who could not send their sons far away.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994), 56. Because of the easy access to schooling, many men were educated and able to obtain higher-level jobs. Liberal educational programs in England intended to prepare ‚Äú‚Äògentlemen for Parliament, the pulpit, and the bar; for the management of private estates and public works for the professions and scholarship.‚Äô‚ÄùWhitehead, Barbara, ed. WOMENS EDUCATION IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE: a History, 1500 to 1800 (New York and London: Taylor & Francis, 1999), XVI. Because of the abundant opportunities, men rose to positions of power, whether it be in the household or politics. Women, however, did not have the same access to these resources. There was an increase in the number of schoolgirls and girl‚Äôs boarding schools. While men assumed the diverse positions offered to them, women learned ‚Äúcookery and laundry‚Ä¶ sewing‚Ä¶ needlework‚Ä¶ and the inculcation of social graces through the teaching of music and dancing.‚Äù Schooling for women was primarily for domestic purposes. Also, schooling was not necessarily typical for women; usually, upper families educated their daughters. Overall, a significant number of women were not formally educated.Whitehead, Barbara, ed. WOMENS EDUCATION IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE: a History, 1500 to 1800 (New York and London: Taylor & Francis, 1999), X. Having a classic education seemed like luxury; knowing about ‚Äúprovisioning, attending illnesses of the household, protecting the estates in the absence of fathers, brothers, and husbands, and dealing with legal matters were vital to the smooth running of estates.‚ÄùWhitehead, Barbara, ed. WOMENS EDUCATION IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE: a History, 1500 to 1800 (New York and London: Taylor & Francis, 1999), 18. Despite not having easy access to a formal education, women were responsible for teaching their children. It was the parent's duty to guide their children through life by shaping their morals and valuesBen-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994),66. Therefore, women lacked the same opportunities as men. Despite this, they still proved useful running the household; whether that be taking care of children, sewing clothes, or doing household chores. Equality regarding education would not happen for a long time, but women made small strides in learning to read and be literate, despite their lack of educational opportunities. Typically, childhood reached its end with marriage. Theories behind virginity and processes of courtship during the early modern period also enforced the patriarchal structure of society; marriage was also another reminder of how that patriarchal structure affects households. Following marriage, men and women typically evolved into parenthood, symbolizing the end of their adolescence. Before courtship occurred, there were pressures arising from both men and women's families for marriage, but there was also promiscuity between both parties. Men visiting bawdy-houses was not out of the ordinary; ‚Äúyoung people appear then to have been‚Ä¶ less rigid in their morals than married adults. This was true of males and to some extent of females.‚ÄùBen-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994),201. Courtship occurred as well. This included ‚Äúcasual companionship‚Äù Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994),200. at public events, but also meetings in much more private areas; this included ‚Äúregular meetings, close familiarity, and a great deal of physical contact in private or semi- private places.‚Äù On rare occasion, couples would spend an entire night together where ‚Äúthe young woman lived, in an alehouse, or in the open air.‚Äù Following courtship, marriage ensued. Marriage was extremely important in early modern society. Some historians even believe that this was one of the most important processes in obtaining adulthood.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994),208. It ‚Äúinvolved the formation of a separate household which performed a multiplicity of social and economic roles - it was a locus of male authority and rule, and a unit of procreation, consumption and production.‚Äù The patriarchal household was crucial in a successful marriage. The husband primarily held the most power in the household, while the wife was in charge of being a mother and educating her children, and maintaining the household. Even though the patriarchal structure of marriage was important, there were limitations. There were many social expectations, especially for women, regarding marriage. The expectations of sexual habits surrounding married women resulted in certain attitudes to form around female youth.Ben-Amos, Ilana Krausman, Adolescence and Youth in Early Modern England (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994),202. In fact, there were even pressures surrounding marriage before the woman was even married; ‚Äúfamily pressures on women‚Äôs choice of partners and their courting were stronger than those placed on men.‚Äù Despite how necessary it was for women to marry in order to fully succeed in life, women were extremely restricted in what they could do. They were usually contained to working in the household unless their husband passed, or they needed extra money in which she would most likely have a job in the textile field. All in all, marriage was important in symbolizing adulthood, but it still did restrict women and the roles they had in society. Childhood had multiple stages in early modern England. Each of these developmental stages had specific characteristics that were followed with jobs or responsibilities for family members. Women and men had similar characteristics in adolescence, but as they got older, both split ways to take on their gender-specific roles, which implemented the idea of a patriarchal society. Enlightenment era The Age of Innocence c.1785/8. Reynolds emphasized the natural grace of children in his paintings The modern notion of childhood with its own autonomy and goals began to emerge during the Enlightenment and the Romantic period that followed it. Jean Jacques Rousseau formulated the romantic attitude towards children in his famous 1762 novel Emile: or, On Education. Building on the ideas of John Locke and other 17th- century thinkers, Rousseau described childhood as a brief period of sanctuary before people encounter the perils and hardships of adulthood. \\"Why rob these innocents of the joys which pass so quickly,\\" Rousseau pleaded. \\"Why fill with bitterness the fleeting early days of childhood, days which will no more return for them than for you?\\"David Cohen, The development of play (2006) p 20 The idea of childhood as a locus of divinity and innocence is further expounded upon in William Wordsworth's \\"Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\\", the imagery of which he \\"fashioned from a complex mix of pastoral aesthetics, pantheistic views of divinity, and an idea of spiritual purity based on an Edenic notion of pastoral innocence infused with Neoplatonic notions of reincarnation\\". This Romantic conception of childhood, historian Margaret Reeves suggests, has a longer history than generally recognized, with its roots traceable to similarly imaginative constructions of childhood circulating, for example, in the neo-platonic poetry of seventeenth-century metaphysical poet Henry Vaughan (e.g., \\"The Retreate\\", 1650; \\"Childe-hood\\", 1655). Such views contrasted with the stridently didactic, Calvinist views of infant depravity. These new attitudes can be discerned from the dramatic increase in artistic depictions of children at the time. Instead of depicting children as small versions of adults typically engaged in 'adult' tasks, they were increasingly shown as physically and emotionally distinct and were often used as an allegory for innocence. Children are viewed and acknowledged as being powerless and inferior to the adult world surrounding them due to the myth of childhood innocence being accepted and acknowledged by society. Sir Joshua Reynolds' extensive children portraiture clearly demonstrate the new enlightened attitudes toward young children. His 1788 painting The Age of Innocence, emphasizes the innocence and natural grace of the posing child and soon became a public favourite. Building on Locke's theory that all minds began as a blank slate, the eighteenth century witnessed a marked rise in children's textbooks that were more easy to read, and in publications like poems, stories, novellas and games that were aimed at the impressionable minds of young learners. These books promoted reading, writing and drawing as central forms of self-formation for children. During this period children's education became more common and institutionalized, in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators. Small local schools where poor children learned to read and write were established by philanthropists, while the sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites were given distinct educations at the grammar school and university. Children's rights under the law With the onset of industrialisation in England, a growing divergence between high-minded romantic ideals of childhood and the reality of the growing magnitude of child exploitation in the workplace, became increasingly apparent. Although child labour was common in pre-industrial times, children would generally help their parents with the farming or cottage crafts. By the late 18th century, however, children were specially employed at the factories and mines and as chimney sweeps,Laura Del Col, West Virginia University, The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay.Barbara Daniels, Poverty and Families in the Victorian Era In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered cotton mills were described as children.\\"Child Labour and the Division of Labour in the Early English Cotton Mills\\". Douglas A. Galbi. Centre for History and Economics, King's College, Cambridge CB2 1ST. In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a breadwinner, as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age. In coal mines, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults.Jane Humphries, Childhood And Child Labour in the British Industrial Revolution (2010) p 33 As the century wore on, the contradiction between the conditions on the ground for children of the poor and the middle-class notion of childhood as a time of innocence led to the first campaigns for the imposition of legal protection for children. Reformers attacked child labor from the 1830s onward, bolstered by the horrific descriptions of London street life by Charles Dickens.Amberyl Malkovich, Charles Dickens and the Victorian Child: Romanticizing and Socializing the Imperfect Child (2011) The campaign that led to the Factory Acts was spearheaded by rich philanthropists of the era, especially Lord Shaftesbury, who introduced Bills in Parliament to mitigate the exploitation of children at the workplace. In 1833 he introduced the Ten Hours Act 1833 into the Commons, which provided that children working in the cotton and woollen industries must be aged nine or above; no person under the age of eighteen was to work more than ten hours a day or eight hours on a Saturday; and no one under twenty-five was to work nights.Battiscombe, p. 88, p. 91. Legal interventions throughout the century increased the level of childhood protection, despite the prevalence of the Victorian laissez-faire attitude toward government interference. In 1856, the law permitted child labour past age 9 for 60 hours per week. In 1901, the permissible child labour age was raised to 12.\\"The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England\\". Laura Del Col, West Virginia University. Modern childhood The modern attitude to children emerged by the late 19th century; the Victorian middle and upper classes emphasized the role of the family and the sanctity of the child ‚Äì an attitude that has remained dominant in Western societies ever since.Thomas E. Jordan, Victorian Child Savers and Their Culture: A Thematic Evaluation (1998) This can be seen in the emergence of the new genre of children's literature. Instead of the didactic nature of children's books of a previous age, authors began to write humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child's imagination. Tom Brown's School Days by Thomas Hughes appeared in 1857, and is considered as the founding book in the school story tradition. Lewis Carroll's fantasy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, signalled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first \\"English masterpiece written for children\\" and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the \\"First Golden Age\\" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s. =Compulsory schooling= First procession of Armenian scouts in Constantinople in 1918 The latter half of the century also saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. Modern methods of public schooling, with tax-supported schools, compulsory attendance, and educated teachers emerged first in Prussia in the early 19th century,Eda Sagarra, A Social History of Germany 1648‚Äì1914 (1977) pp 275‚Äì84 and was adopted by Britain, the United States, FranceEugen Weber, Peasants into Frenchmen: The Modernization of Rural France, 1870‚Äì1914 (1976) pp 303‚Äì38 and other modern nations by 1900. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.Howard Chudacoff, Children at Play: An American History (2008) The Boy Scouts was founded by Sir Robert Baden-Powell in 1908, which provided young boys with outdoor activities aiming at developing character, citizenship, and personal fitness qualities. The nature of childhood on the American frontier is disputed. One group of scholars, following the lead of novelists Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder, argue that the rural environment was salubrious. Historians Katherine HarrisKatherine Harris, Long Vistas: Women and Families on Colorado Homesteads (1993) and Elliott WestElliott West, Growing Up with the Country: Childhood on the Far Western Frontier (1989) write that rural upbringing allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. On the other hand, historians Elizabeth HampstenElizabeth Hampsten, Settlers' Children: Growing Up on the Great Plains (1991) and Lillian SchlisselLillian Schlissel, Byrd Gibbens and Elizabeth Hampsten, Far from Home: Families of the Westward Journey (2002) offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age. Riney-Kehrberg takes a middle position.Pamela Riney-Kehrberg, Childhood on the Farm: Work, Play, and Coming of Age in the Midwest (2005) Over the 21st century, some sex-selection clinics have shown a preference for female children over male children. =Creativity= In mid 20th century America, there was intense interest in using institutions to support the innate creativity of children. It helped reshape children's play, the design of suburban homes, schools, parks, and museums. Producers of children's television programming worked to spark creativity. Educational toys designed to teach skills or develop abilities proliferated. For schools there was a new emphasis on arts as well as science in the curriculum.Amy F. Ogata, Designing the Creative Child: Playthings and Places in Midcentury America (2013) The emphasis was reversed in the 1980s, as public policy emphasized test scores, school principals downplayed anything that was not being scored on standardized tests.Leo M. Casey, \\"The Will to Quantify: The 'Bottom Line' in the Market Model of Education Reform.\\" Teachers College Record 115.9 (2013) After 2000 some children became mesmerized by their cell phones, often checking their text messages or Facebook page. Checking Facebook and responding to text messages is a form of participatory culture. Participatory culture is engaging with media and developing ones voice and identity. By doing so, children are able to develop their voices and identities in a space separate from adults (Henry Jenkins). According to the UNCRC, children have the right to participate online with matters concerning them. They also have the right to give their opinions about certain matters, and these opinions should be heard by adults. Engaging in the digital environments gives children the access to worldwide issues, and also gives them the ability to decide what parts of their lives they want to keep private, and what parts they want to make public. =Non-Western world= The modern concept of childhood was copied by non-Western societies as they modernized. In the vanguard was Japan, which actively began to engage with the West after 1860. Meiji era leaders decided that the nation-state had the primary role in mobilizing individuals ‚Äì and children ‚Äì in service of the state. The Western-style school was introduced as the agent to reach that goal. By the 1890s, schools were generating new sensibilities regarding childhood.Brian Platt, \\"Japanese Childhood, Modern Childhood: The Nation-State, the School, and 19th-Century Globalization,\\" Journal of Social History, Summer 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 4, pp. 965‚Äì985. . . By the turn of the 20th century, Japan had numerous reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and well-educated mothers who had adopted these new attitudes.Kathleen S.

Olive Heights) is a small Jewish settlement on the Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem, inside the Arab neighborhood of Ras al-Amud. In 2010 its inhabitants numbered some 250 people belonging to 50 families. In 2011 it was projected to house 110 families and eventually merge with the new settlement of Ma'alot David, designed to replace an old police station across the street from Ma'ale HaZeitim, which would make them become the largest Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. By 2016 Ma'ale HaZeitim was housing about 90 families and the adjacent project, now called Ma‚Äôalot David, had 23 housing units. In 2017, construction started on a community center, which will include two synagogues, a kindergarten, a higher learning institution, a library and an event hall, all overlooking the Temple Mount. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History In 2003, a group of eight Jews moved to a compound of three dilapidated homes surrounded by graves in the Sephardi section of the Mount of Olives cemetery. According to the General Burial Society of Jerusalem, which legally owned the site, drug users had taken over the compound, which had become a dumping site for construction debris and a chop shop for stolen cars. Other Jewish property in the area was a gas station a few hundred meters from Ma'aleh Hazeitim and several other buildings. The burial society plot had been acquired in the mid-19th century by philanthropists Moshe Wittenberg and Nissan Bak, trustees for kollels affiliated with the Chabad and Wollin hassidim. Land on the outskirts of the Mount of Olives was designated as part of the existing Jewish cemetery, but the Turks did not permit the Jews to bury their dead in areas south of the Jerusalem-Jericho road. Meanwhile, the kollels leased the land to an Arab farmer who grew the wheat for a special Passover matza. In 1923, when the British changed the land ownership laws, the land was formally transferred to the Wollin and Chabad kollels. Irving Moskowitz, an American businessman and philanthropist, purchased the land in 1990. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the adjacent plot owned by the Bukharan community was confiscated for security reasons and used by the Arab Legion; while the plot bought by Wittenberg and Bak was administered by the Jordanian Custodian of Enemy Property, an organization established to handle property owned by Jews in the Jordanian controlled West Bank. After the Six-Day War of 1967 the land was transferred to the Israel Land Administration, which placed it under the jurisdiction of the Jerusalem Municipality.MELANIE LIDMAN. 60 east J‚Äôlem Jewish homes to be dedicated. 5.23.2011 In September 1997, plans for the construction of new Jewish homes on the land were approved. This provoked an international outcry. Despite American pressure to halt building in the area, the plan was backed by Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert.

In May 2011, two demonstrations were held by the Solidarity movement, to protest Jewish housing activity in Ras el-Amud. The first took place during a dedication ceremony for Ma'ale HaZeitim, which came 8 years after the actual establishment of the settlement. The ceremony was attended by numerous officials, including members of Knesset including its then-Speaker and current President of Israel Reuven Rivlin, government ministers, and the mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat. At the second demonstration police arrested six protesters after fighting broke out between protesters and security guards. Protesters claimed that the guards had attacked them and the police had broken a protester's hand. The police claimed that the protestors attempted to break into homes belonging to Jewish residents. Aryeh King is one of the founders of the initial Ma'aleh Hazeitim compound and a member of the Jerusalem City Council, who has been removed in 2014 from his position as head of the emergency and security resort by the city mayor Nir Barkat for his push towards stronger Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem. His house was attacked on 21 June 2015 with Molotov cocktails and stones and he declared that since the Israeli police has abandoned him and his Jewish neighbours, they will immediately set up their own private security team and start patrolling the area by themselves.

Interconnection If built, it would be the first HVDC route to connect Scotland's electricity network directly to that of mainland Europe (though there are existing connections from England to mainland Europe), whereas Norway already has interconnectors to Denmark and the Netherlands, with an interconnector to Germany at the planning stage (see NORD.LINK and NorGer). Project partners The ¬£1.75 billion project is being developed by NorthConnect, a Norwegian company specially set up by five electricity companies (Agder Energi, E-CO, Lyse, SSE plc and Vattenfall) to advance the scheme, with 2020 as the target start date. It is hoped that the connector will assist the growth of the Norwegian and Scottish renewable energy industries. Route The Scottish landfall is planned to be at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, where the connector will join the National Grid. The Norwegian landfall will be Simalden at the head of the Hardangerfjord in Norway. Specification The HVDC cable will be approximately 665km long, and have a capacity of 1400MW. It is expected to cost 1.7bn Euros. Current status On 25 March 2020, NorthConnect received a letter from the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, informing them that NorthConnect's license applications would not be processed at the present time, making the future of the project unclear. Project history On 5 March 2013 it was announced that SSE has left the project. The Norwegian government ruled that only Statnett could own export cables. In 2016, Norway debates rules for export cables. In June 2016, Ofgem approved NorthConnect. Other approvals are still needed. The European Union put NorthConnect on the \\"Projects of Common Interest\\" list and supported its development with ‚Ç¨10m. A 2019 analysis by the Norwegian water department indicates that the connection would be economically viable despite an increase of less than half a eurocent per kWh for Norwegian consumers. By 2019, the project had received all the most important marine and planning consents in the UK. Following detailed design work, it was hoped that the link will be constructed between 2019 and 2022. The consortium hopes to make a final investment decision in 2020. In March 2020, the Norwegian Government placed the NorthConnect project on hold pending studies on the new UK (north of England) and German interconnectors. https://www.insider.co.uk/news/norway- puts-subsea-renewables-link-21779783 See also * Cross-Skagerrak (Norway- Denmark) * HVDC Moyle (Scotland-Northern Ireland) * NorNed (Norway- Netherlands) * NORD.LINK (proposed Norway-Germany) * NorGer (proposed Norway- Germany) References External links * Official website of NorthConnect Category:Electrical interconnectors to and from Great Britain Category:Electrical interconnectors to and from the Nordic grid Category:2020 in Europe Category:Electric power infrastructure in Scotland Category:Electric power infrastructure in Norway Category:HVDC transmission lines Category:Kristiansand Category:Electrical interconnectors in the North Sea Category:Proposed electric power transmission systems Category:Norway‚ÄìScotland relations ","title":"NorthConnect"},{"id":"33247649","text":"The Pawpaw Festival or Ohio Pawpaw Festival is an annual festival dedicated to the Pawpaw fruit (Asimina triloba) that is indigenous to the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States, and cultivated in the Athens County, Ohio, area. The festival, sponsored by the Ohio Pawpaw Growers' Association, takes place near Lake Snowden in Albany, Ohio, in mid-September, during the peak of the fruit's harvest., 2011 Ohio Pawpaw Festival, retrieved August 6, 2011 Various pawpaw brews and other pawpaw-related activities are offered. The event has been sponsored by a number of different local organizations. The first Pawpaw Festival took place on October 10, 1999. History In 1996, Chris Chmiel founded Integration Acres and, in 1999, the organization began promoting the Pawpaw. In 1999, Chmeil, along with Integration Acres, created the first annual Pawpaw Festival., \\"Integration Acres\\", retrieved 2011-09-19 In 2000, Chris worked again with the Albany Riding Club and to bring about another festival on September 16. By this time the festival gained some popularity. In 2001, the festival moved to Lake Snowden, the present day location of the festival. Moreover, the birth of the Ohio Pawpaw Growers Association took place. In 2006, the Pawpaw Festival saw a great change, as the sponsor was that of Snowville Creamery. Memorable events included the Pawpaw Green Woman logo and the fifteen kegs of pawpaw beer. In 2007, the sponsor of the festival was Ohio's Hill Country Heritage Area program and included live musical band performances, with audio CDs. In 2008, the Pawpaw festival made itself more accessible, with the assistance of the Office of Sustainability, by offering a shuttle service for those college students that wanted to attend., \\"The Athens News\\", retrieved 2011-09-28 In 2009, the festival increased in attendance thanks to the appearance of various officials. The pawpaw became the official state native fruit of Ohio. This year eighteen kegs of pawpaw beer were consumed becoming the most consumed to date. 2010 brought about a longer festival wherein the previous one- and two- day festival periods were increased to three days instead. Most recently in 2011, the 13th annual Pawpaw Festival, it continues to run as a three-day-long event. Also, the 13th annual festival was sponsored by the Ohio's Hill Country Heritage Area program once again., \\"Ohio's Hill Country Heritage Area\\", retrieved 2011-09-28 2020 will see no festival, as the COVID-19 pandemic caused their cancellation. Officials Initially, the Pawpaw Festival, as all things starting out, had not gained enough popularity with the surrounding region. Therefore, the festival needed to find a way in which they could increase their presence within the area. One method would be through the attendance of officials to validate the success of the festival. The first festival brought in individuals from Better Homes and Garden; along with The Washington Post and the Athens County Convention and Visitors Bureau. The following year, judges for the festival included Sue Dawson and a food editor for the Columbus Dispatch. This pattern continued with more judges to attend and participate in the festivities. Then in 2002 the Director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture, Suzanne Martinson attended. Also in attendance were a food writer from Cleveland and from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 2004 had a special guest appearance from Ohio State House Representative Jimmy Stewart who was the sponsor of a bill to make the pawpaw the official state fruit of Ohio. Finally, in 2009, big name officials like Ohio Representative Debbie Phillips and Ohio Senator Jimmy Stewart attended in order to present Chris Chmiel with an award designating the pawpaw as the official state native fruit of Ohio. Activities Within the festival itself there are various pawpaw- related activities one can get involved with including: competition for the best pawpaw, best pawpaw-related work of art, the pawpaw cook-off, and the pawpaw-eating contest. One can also partake of the other entertainment options such as: the Kids Central, with various hands-on activities and a variety of activities that focus upon pawpaw growing, cooking, genetics, medical use and other topics related to sustainability of the pawpaw environment. Entertainment Each year, the Pawpaw Festival is host to a wide variety of local and regional musical acts. The music begins with the festival on Friday afternoon and runs until midnight, followed by music all day Saturday and until the afternoon on Sunday. In 2011, the Pawpaw Festival introduced the Beer Stage, a secondary stage located near the beer tent which hosts smaller acts for shorter sets. According to \\"The Athens News\\" the Pawpaw Festival is a good place to experience the music that is offered from the Athens County region., \\"The Athens News\\", retrieved 2011-09-19 In addition to music, there are also a variety of cultural and historical demonstrations. The East of the River Shawnee Tribe shares traditional culture and there is an atlatl competition as well as a 1790s frontier camp.

Life Andr√© Koechlin was born in France to the Koechlin family, where he was the grandson of Samuel Koechlin, son-in-law of Daniel Dollfus- Mieg, head of the Dollfus-Mieg textile company and the first cousin once removed of structural engineer, Maurice Koechlin, who is an ancestor of actress Kalki Koechlin. Under his lead, between 1818 and 1826, the company became the leading textile company of Mulhouse. Turning in 1826 to the building of machinery for the textile industry, Koechlin became knowledgeable in the fabrication of steam machines and started making railroad equipment. The firm prospered and in 1839 already employed 1,800 people. By 1842, they were the largest French locomotive maker, having built 22 of them by then. This rose rapidly, and in 1857 alone, they made 91 locomotives. They stayed one of the six large French locomotive constructors until the merger with Els√§ssische Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Grafenstaden in 1872, when the company became Soci√©t√© Alsacienne de Constructions M√©caniques. Andr√© Koechlin was mayor of Mulhouse from 1830 until 1843, and was elected a deputy in 1830, 1831, 1841 and 1846. He became a Knight in the Legion of Honour in 1836.

Career Since the late 1970s, Myers has been involved in numerous issues including movement work for racial justice, economic equity, indigenous sovereignty, anti-nuclear activism and ecological justice and restoration. He has traveled as an \\"old-school\\" itinerant teacher for over twenty years teaching in homes, churches, retreat centers and more. In 1988, Myers published Binding the Strong ManA Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus, which was influential in the Radical Discipleship Movement, particularly within the Catholic Worker Movement. The book was one of the earliest commentaries to take an empire-critical view, a view that was marginal in the 1980s, but is now widely accepted within the academy. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Myers devoted much of his teaching to what he calls Sabbath economics. He works alongside his wife, Elaine Enns, as part of Bartimaeus Cooperative Ministries, where the emphasis is on education for restorative justice, biblical literacy, ecological discipleship and radical economic sharing. =Bibliography= Books Authored 2008/1988 Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark‚Äôs Story of Jesus.

It is the largest man-made lagoon system in the world. History In early 2003, work began on the construction of Shark Bay in a vacant patch of land adjacent to the Mid Monorail Station and Polar Bear Shores. During the construction period seven sharks were being kept inside the main lagoon swimming pool of Sea World's Water Park. In August 2003, the RSPCA began an investigation into the treatment of the sharks whilst in captivity. The investigation resulted in Sea World releasing the world's largest tiger shark in captivity back into the wild. Sea World had originally planned to move the sharks into Shark Bay in October 2003, prior to the public opening of the exhibit on 26 December 2003. A variety of delays forced the opening date to be moved back to 9 April 2004. The exhibit cost $13 million to construct. Exhibit The layout of Shark Bay. Key: Red = Shark Lagoon; Green = Reef Lagoon; Blue = Inter-Tidal Zone; Yellow = Touch Pools The Shark Bay exhibit is divided into four distinct sections. The main section is the Shark Lagoon. It houses some of the world's largest, most feared and potentially dangerous sharks. Unlike other smaller shark exhibits, the Shark Lagoon at Shark Bay allows for the sharks to have a swimming pattern which is essential for them to be able to rest whilst swimming. As the name suggests, the Reef Lagoon is a reef-themed environment. It houses a variety of smaller sharks alongside rays and other fish. Guests can view both the Shark Lagoon and Reef Lagoon from a series above ground viewing areas as well as through four underwater viewing windows. An additional window of this size separates the two sections and allows divers in the Reef Lagoon to view the sharks in the Shark Lagoon. The Inter-Tidal Zone is attached to the Reef Lagoon and is adjacent to the Touch Pools. The area is home to a variety of small fish and other marine life. The final zone is the Touch Pools. Within this section, guests are able to touch a variety of marine animals in the shallow water. Collectively, these areas make Shark Bay the largest man-made lagoon system in the world. Animal Adventures Similar to other marine attractions at Sea World, guests have the opportunity to experience one of four Animal Adventures at Shark Bay for an additional fee. A Tropical Reef Snorkel allows guests to swim with the sharks and other marine life in the Reef Lagoon. Similarly, the Shark SCUBA Animal Adventure allows qualified guests to SCUBA in the Reef Lagoon. Within the Shark Lagoon guests can choose an up-close encounter and an above water journey. The Shark Encounter allows guests to enter an acrylic cage and watch the sharks be fed up close. Finally, the Glass Bottom Boat Animal Adventure allows guests to view the sharks up-close from a unique angle without the need to put a foot in the water. Marketing The opening of Shark Bay was heavily marketed locally, nationally and internationally. An Australian advertising campaign was launched with print, television, cinema and radio advertising. This campaign alone cost $2 million. Additionally the international markets of the United Kingdom, Singapore and Taiwan were also targeted in other campaigns.

The method of \\"strip farming\\" was in use under the open field system. The mustard-colored areas are part of the demesne, the hatched areas part of the glebe. The manor house, residence of the lord and location of the manorial court, can be seen in the mid-southern part of the manor, near the parish church. A manor is the basic unit of manorialism, which became the dominant economic system during parts of the European Middle Ages. It defined the relationship between the lord of the manor, and serfs and free peasants who worked various plots of land. In English law, Welsh law and Irish law, the lord held an estate in land (land title) which included the right to hold a manorial court. The court had jurisdiction over most of those who lived within the lands of the manor. The smallest unit of land under the feudal system (which defined the military and legal relationships between nobles) is the fee (or fief), on which the manor became established through the process of time. In modern terms, the manor could be thought of as the \\"business\\" which the lord establishes on the fief, which is the area of land they have been granted. The manor is nevertheless often described as the basic feudal unit of land tenure and is historically connected with the territorial divisions of the march, county, hundred, parish and township. Legal theory The legal theory of the origin of manors refers them to a grant from the crown of a fee from the monarch's allodial lands, as stated in the following extract from Perkins's Treatise on the laws of England: > \\"The beginning of a manor was when the king gave a thousand acres of land, > or greater or lesser parcel of land, unto one of his subjects and his heirs, > which tenure is knight service at the least. And the donee did perhaps build > a mansion house upon parcel of the same land, and of 20 acres, parcel of > that which remained, or of a greater or lesser parcel, before the statute of > Quia emptores did enfeoff a stranger to hold of him and his heirs to plough > 10 acres of land, parcel of that which remained in his possession, and did > enfeoff another of another parcel thereof to go to war with him against the > Scots etc., and so by continuance of time made a manor\\". It is still as the jurist Sir Joshua Williams terms it, a \\"fundamental rule\\" that all lands were originally derived from the crown and that the monarch is lord paramount mediate or immediate of all the land in the realm. A manor then arises when the holder of a parcel so granted or supposed to have been granted by the crown, and who is termed in relation thereto the lord of the manor, has in turn granted portions thereof to others who stand to him in the relation of tenants. Of the portion reserved by the lord for his own use, termed the demesne, part was occupied by villeins, with the duty of cultivating the rest for the lord's use. These were originally tenants at will and in a state of semi-serfdom but they became in course of time the copyhold tenants of the later law. It is of the essence of copyhold that it should be regulated by the custom of the manor, as evidenced in the manorial roll produced by the manorial court. Manors cannot be created at the present day because manorial courts cannot be established with any legal jurisdiction. Scriven stated:Scriven, John, (Serjeant at law), A treatise on copyhold, customary freehold, and ancient demesne tenure: with the jurisdiction of Courts baron and Courts leet; also an appendix, containing rules for holding Customary courts, Courts baron and Courts leet, forms of court rolls, deputations, and copyhold assurances, and extracts from the relative acts of Parliament, 2 vols., 2nd. ed., London, 1823, vol.1, chap. 1 > \\"Length of time being of the very essence of a manor, such things as receive > their perfection by the continuance of time come not within the compass of > the king's prerogative\\" Effect of Quia Emptores The effect of the statute of Quia Emptores (1290) was to make the creation of manors henceforward impossible, inasmuch as it enacted \\"that upon all sales and feoffments of land the feoffee shall hold the same, not of his immediate feoffor, but of the chief lord of the fee of whom such feoffor himself held it\\". The statute did not apply to a tenant-in-chief of the king, who might have alienated his land under a license. Accordingly, it is assumed that all existing manors are \\"of a date prior to the statute of Quia Emptores except perhaps some which may have been created by the king's tenants-in-chief with license from the crown\\".Williams, Real Property, chap. 4; See also Scriven, Copyholds, chap 1 When a great baron had granted out smaller manors to others, the seignory of the superior baron was frequently termed an honour. Differentiated by legal status All land was differentiated by its legal status and by physical characteristics. The basic forms of tenure were: Freehold, Copyhold, Customary Freehold and Leasehold. The legal status of land in England and Wales has been simplified such that only Freehold and Leasehold land remains (although, since 2002, a new category, Commonhold, also exists). In Ireland (Northern and Republic), only Freehold and Leasehold land remain. Constituent physical elements *Demesne divided into: ** deer park, where the high and rare honour of a royal licence to empark had been obtained, usually restricted to great nobles or to the king's favoured courtiers, which enabled the lord to de-bar entry into the emparked area to other hunters, including to the king himself, who was accustomed to hunt several dozen square miles at a time with hundreds of hunt followers when on royal progresses around his kingdom. Horsemen would surround such large area in a funnel shape and all deer enclosed within would be systematically driven into large nets at the mouth of the funnel, to be slaughtered and later cooked and eaten by the king's huge retinue. Thus the lord of the manor would be able to enclose the licensed area by casting up an earthbank and hedge or a stone wall, both to preserve his own deer captive within, safe from predation and to prevent entry by others. Such arrangements frequently caused disputes amongst neighbouring lords and the annals record many instances of deliberate break-ins and breaking down of hedges for the purpose of exercising purported hunting-rights. **pleasure garden, a later development. **manor farm, home farm or barton, land retained \\"in-hand\\" by the lord of the manor, without sub-tenant and exploited for his own direct benefit by his own paid servants or manorial workforce, being chiefly, until later centuries, tenants-at-will (those with no tenancy rights) or those whose copyhold tenancies stipulated so many days per month or year to be worked on the demesne. *Village, a settlement where most of the tenants lived, originally the villeins, tenants of the lord. The villa was the centre of the manor in Roman Britain. *Cotts (or cottages) scattered individual small farmsteads occupied by the cottars, a superior class of tenants. *Courthouse, in which manorial courts were held where a non-resident lord had no manor house and thus no great hall in which such business could be transacted by his steward. This was a common arrangement as many absentee lords held multiple manors and resided on only one permanently, or commuted between only two or three. *Church land, the land on which was built the parish church. Originally part of the demesne land. Many surviving early mediaeval deeds record donations of land by lords to a local priory, perhaps one founded by their ancestors, for the purpose of establishing a parish church on. Sometimes an existing church was given by the lord to some favoured priory.For example Molland Church in Devon was given by the lord of the manor in the 12th century to Hartland Abbey Parish churches were built and established by the original lords of each manor, in consultation with the bishop, out of self-interest, next to their manor houses, as being close to an institution which was believed to have direct access to an all-powerful god was clearly advantageous, perhaps even deemed essential for prosperity. Naves were added to the original buildings (which then became chancels) as parishioners began to require access also, usually built and maintained at the expense of the parishioners. Many such churches were built in time immemorial or pre-historic Celtic or later Anglo-Saxon times, thus the process of their establishment is not recorded. The Norman Conquest of 1066 obtained for King William ready-made and fully staffed \\"going concern\\" manors, income-producing businesses, and parish churches which had been established for centuries. *Manorial chapels (or \\"manorial aisles\\") were built onto the sides of chancels of parish churches as the lord's household expanded, for the seating of the lord and his household at mass. He was thus seated in a private area out of direct view of his tenants occupying the nave, with its own private external entrance, and was near the high altar, the holiest place in the church, and was able to view the priest elevating the host, the holiest part of the mass, through a squint let into the intervening wall, if any. He and his family were buried under the floor of the manorial chapel, in dedicated vaults or under individual ledger stones, or in the chancel nearer the high altar itself, the position of greatest honour being to the immediate north of the high altar, a position frequently occupied by founder's tombs and their effigies or monuments. From the 17th century, the lord's family erected their mural monuments on the walls of the manorial chapel. The lords were responsible for the building costs and for financing the maintenance of the fabric of the manorial chapel. *Glebe, land donated in fee at some time by a previous lord of the manor to the rectory for support of the rector (parson or parish priest). Each succeeding rector thus became effectively the life tenant. In addition to the produce from the glebe, the rector was entitled to tithes from the manor as a whole, in general one-tenth of all agricultural produce, due annually from all tenants of the manor, frequently delivered before the specified due date into the tithe barn, a large structure within the manor. *Common land, by convention open land, over which the lord, certain manorial tenants, and other parishioners held shared rights. For example, grazing rights or a right of estovers (taking wood). *Woodland, in which tenants might have the right to pannage (feeding swine on acorns). *Corn-mill, usually situated by a stream and driven by water power, at which tenants were obliged to grind their corn into flour, thus providing a further revenue stream for the lord, who had a captive customer base. They were thus forbidden from grinding at the mill within any other manor. *Freehold. Such \\"free-tenants\\" or \\"free men\\" had a duty to attend and sit as jury on the lord's manorial court, presided over by himself, or if an absentee lord, by his steward. Apparently not subject to the jurisdiction of the manorial court. Disputes between a lord and his freeholders were held in the county court, presided over by the Sheriff of the county. *Copyhold, the text of which tenancy agreement was recorded only in the manorial roll, which therefore had to be consulted in case of dispute. Subject to the jurisdiction of the manorial court. *Customary Freehold (between the two) *Leasehold (granted for a term, usually one of years or a number of lives not exceeding three, or the longer of either period); the Reversion (also known as Reversionary Freehold Interest or Freehold Reversion), at the end of the term or in case of escheat or forfeiture, is the prospective property of the lord of the manor. =Differentiated by physical character= *Arable, ploughed land used to grow crops. *Waste, economically unproductive land. *Pasture, grassland used for grazing livestock in the summer. *Meadow, grassland set aside for making hay for winter fodder. *Closes, small enclosed fields closed-off by the erection of earth-banks, hedges or stone wall boundaries, used for example to house ewes with their lambs requiring close observation, and for rotational pasture management, reducing parasite infestation and keeping grass fresh. *Marsh, a possible source of reed for thatching of roofs. *Woodland, an essential fuel and building resource. Also used for pannage. *Furze, a highly flammable fuel resource used by the lower tenants. *Fallow, land resting within the cycle of crop rotation agriculture. *Fishpond, for inland manors, used to breed and store fish such as carp for eating on Fridays when the eating of meat was prohibited by religious custom. *Quarry, a source of building stone and of lime for burning to create mortar and fertiliser. Officers A manor was akin to the modern firm or business or other going concern. It was a productive unit, which required physical capital, in the form of land, buildings, equipment and draught animals such as ploughing oxen and labour in the form of direction, day-to-day management and a workforce. It was further similar in that its ownership could be transferred, with the necessary \\"licence to alienate\\" having been obtained from the overlord, as can the ownership of a modern company. The administration was self-contained and the new lord needed only to collect its net revenues to form his return on investment. The direction was ultimately provided by the manorial court, presided over by the lord's personal steward, whose members included the freehold tenants of the manor. The court itself appointed most of the lower manorial officers, which included the following: *Bailiff, in charge of supervising the cultivation of the manor. *Reeve, an overseer. *Ditch Reeve, responsible for maintaining drainage ditches. The efficiency, productivity and thus profitability of a manor, therefore, depended on a mixture of qualities and interaction of location, micro-climate, natural resources, soil type, direction and labour. It was in the interest of all dwellers within the manor, to a greater or lesser degree, that it should be successful. Jurisdiction The manorial court had wide legal jurisdiction over the inhabitants of the manor, sometimes with the right to administer capital punishment, if the lord had obtained from the king the right of holding a court leet. Much of the law was specific to a particular manor, as developed by \\"custom of the manor\\" and as interpreted by the manorial court. Rights of appeal existed to the hundred court and the county court beyond that over which presided the county's sheriff. Free manor A free manor was an autonomous area, outside the jurisdiction, law and administrative control of the surrounding territory.Across the open field: essays drawn from English landscapes, page 101 Laurie Olin, published 2000, , accessed 2011-10-17 Membership Every person who lived in medieval England was regarded as a member of a manor and was under the jurisdiction of a manorial court, unless a citizen of a borough (in certain generally urban towns), or a cleric, or a lord of the manor himself, or (failing sons) an heiress lady of the manor herself, who were subject to the primary jurisdiction of the king's court, if a tenant-in-chief, or of the county court, if a mesne (intermediate) lord. It was not permissible for a man to migrate from the manor of his birth except by arrangement with its authorities. The manor was typically, via its vestry, also the source of a needy family's charitable relief, which was at the discretion of the manorial court, according to the custom of each manor. An alien within a manor would not, therefore, be automatically entitled to any relief or protection (such as parish constables) offered by the lord to prevent crime. Merchants and travellers were in general only safe in travelling with costly hired protection or with protection in place from a local sheriff, particularly in remote and sparsely populated areas. Even in 1822, the book Rural Rides refers to frequent instances of robbery in rural areas.Rural Rides Volume i. THROUGH HAMPSHIRE, BERKSHIRE, SURREY, AND SUSSEX, BETWEEN 7TH OCTOBER AND 1ST DECEMBER, 1822 (ed. Everyman) William Cobbett, p 124 =Residents of a manor= *Lord of the manor (often absent), or an absentee (never resident) *Serfs *Villeins *Cottars *Bordars *Freeholders *Copyholders Current legal status *See Lord of the manor Overlap with parish Any parish which is among the bulk formed in the medieval period (whether town or village, but not in old cores of cities) tended to share its name with the manor (which may or may not exist today). Such non-borough parishes have clerical jurisdiction over the same geographic territory over which the Lord had jurisdiction through his manorial court. The parish generally came into existence after the establishment of the manor, following the building of a church by the Lord of the Manor for the use of himself and his tenants, perhaps in consultation with the bishop within whose clerical jurisdiction the manor was situated.Domesday Map listing all Domesday Book entries - Thorncroft Retrieved 2013-09-30 He gave permanently the parish church some of his land, the revenues from which thus were to support the priest and the maintenance of the church building. The lord of the manor retained the advowson, that is the right to select and appoint the parish priest, yet the parish was governed by the diocese within which it was situated, which also granted it the tithes to which it was legally entitled, which was a tax of one tenth of the produce of the manor. Outlying parts of many manors over time were forcibly lost by judgment or attainder by the sovereign, exchanged between neighbouring lords or sold to pay debts, and thus would change owner, but would almost never change parish. As, over time, a manor's lands could grow and shrink (they could extend over several different parishes), many manors became virtually worthless and lost any pretence of having a lord or became entirely subsumed by another. Others could arise by the principal lord's special grant, approved by the sovereign of subinfeudation.

It allows for a guitar player to produce a synthesized sound using techniques and motions referential to guitar playing. It is built in the shape of an electric guitar, complete with a full twenty- four fret neck. The name comes from the Finnish word for \\"guitar\\". The Kitara was the first digital musical instrument to combine the use of touch buttons for strings and frets with an 8 inch multi-touch screen. The player controls sound effects and parameters through this display, as opposed to strumming strings like on a traditional guitar. The display allows for comprehensive control as well as a wide-variety of noise and effect production. The produced sound changes based on the position, number, and movement of fingers on this display. The Kitara uses an internal wavetable synthesizer with effects to generate sound. The Kitara is powered by an open-sourced Linux based CPU, making it possible to reprogram the Kitara, modify existing sounds, and program new ones. At the 2012 NAMM Show Misa Digital announced a stripped-down Kitara which does not have a synth engine. It went on sale on the Misa site Misa Tri-Bass.http://misa-digital.myshopify.com/products/tri-bass  References  * PC World PC World Article * Misa Digital Kitara Technical Specs * Kitara Discontinued Product Page * ReviewExplorer.com ReviewExplorer Article External links * youtube.com Misa Kitara Demo Category:Guitar synthesizers Category:MIDI ","title":"Misa Kitara"},{"id":"33247744","text":"Lajing Town is a town of Lanping Bai and Pumi Autonomous County in Yunnan province of China.

He was the founder of two Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem, Kirya Ne'emana (better known as Batei Nissan Bak) and a Yemenite Jewish neighborhood, and builder of the Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue, also known as the Nisan Bak Shul. Biography Tiferet Yisrael Synagogue, also known as the Beit Knesset Nisan Bak, c. 1940 Nisan Bak was born in Berdichev as the only son of Rabbi Yisrael Bak, a Sadigura Hasid. The family immigrated to the Land of Israel in 1831. =Father, Israel Bak= Yisrael Bak (1797‚Äì1874), also spelled Israel Bak or Back, came from a family of printers from Berdichev. After working as a printer in his home town between 1815 and 1821 and having to close down his business, he eventually immigrated to Palestine in 1831. He reopened his printing press in Safed, being the first one to print Hebrew books there since the late 17th century. In 1834, his press was destroyed and he was wounded in the peasant revolt against Egyptian rule. He then settled on nearby Mount Yarmak (Meron) together with other fifteen Jewish families, where the community engaged in agriculture, making it the first Jewish farm in the country in modern times and the first new settlement of the traditional Jewish community, the Old Yishuv. Affected first by the Safed earthquake of 1837 and after seeing his press and farm destroyed during the Druze revolt of 1838, he left the Galilee and relocated to Jerusalem. There he established anew his printing press in 1841‚Äìthe first and only Jewish printing press in the city until 1863. Nissan helped his father run the printing press, which produced a large number of books, and in 1863 Israel Bak also started editing Havatzelet, the second Hebrew newspaper in the country. Yisrael Bak was also one of the developers of the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem. In the early 1840s, father and son established the first Hasidic community in Jerusalem. Israel and Nissan Bak managed to have a central Hasidic synagogue built, officially named Tiferet Yisrael after the Hebrew moniker of the head of the Ruzhin Hasidic court, Rav Yisrael Friedman of Ruzhin. It was, however, better known as \\"Nisan Bak's synagogue\\". =Nisan Bak: later years= After assisting his father until his death in 1874, Nisan Bak took over the printing press, which he managed for another nine years. After selling it he continued with his work as a leader of the Jewish community in Jerusalem, more specifically of the Hasidic sector, where he also acted as the local head of the Ruzhin-Sadagura dynasty. Bak, who had good relations with the Ottoman government, managed to soften the decrees targeting the Jewish community and initiated and carried out on its behalf the construction of several housing projects in the city. Bak was also a pioneer of the Jewish Enlightenment, or Haskalah, within his community, together with his brother-in-law I.D. Frumkin, who had renewed the publication of the Havazzelet newspaper in 1870. As part of their reform attempts, Bak and Frumkin opposed the traditional distribution system of charity funds coming from abroad, the halukkah. They were again active among those who established in 1884 the Ezrat Nidda·∏•im Society, a Jewish association designed to counter the activity of Christian missions who were trying to convert the Jews. Ezrat Nidda·∏•im went on to build a small neighbourhood for recently arrived Yemenite Jews in the Arab village of Silwan, next to Jerusalem. Bak died in 1889 and was buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish cemetery. Nisan Bak Synagogue Although there were already Hasidim in Jerusalem by 1747, they had prayed in small, private synagogues and homes. In 1839 Bak began to draw up plans for a Hasidic synagogue. Until then, in 1843, Nissan Bak travelled from Jerusalem to visit the Ruzhiner Rebbe in Sadigura. He informed him that Czar Nikolai I intended to buy a plot of land near the Western Wall with the intention of building a church and monastery. The Ruzhiner Rebbe encouraged Bak to build a synagogue there. He bought the land from its Arab owners for an exorbitant sum a few days before the Czar ordered the Russian consul in Jerusalem to make the purchase. The Czar thus bought another plot of land for a church, today the Russian Compound. The synagogue project, with Bak as architect and contractor, was plagued by constant delays. Over ten years were spent raising funds and building took six years, from 1866 to 1871. The imposing, three-story synagogue was inaugurated on 19 August 1872. For the next 75 years, it served as the centre for the Hasidic community in the city. It was considered one of the most beautiful synagogues of Jerusalem, with a commanding view of the Temple Mount, ornate decorations, and beautiful silver objects donated by Hasidim. It was destroyed by the Arab Legion during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Kirya Ne'emana Kirya Ne'emana in 1925 In 1875 Nisan Bak, together with Rabbi Shmuel Mordechai Warshavsky and under the auspices of Kollel Volhin, founded the Jewish neighborhood of Kirya Ne'emana, initially called Oholei Moshe vi-Yhudit (\\"Tents of Moses and Judith\\"), but popularly known as Batei Nissan Bak (\\"Nissan Bak Houses\\"). The neighborhood was originally intended for Hasidic Jews, but due to lack of financing, only 30 of the planned 60 houses were constructed. The remainder of the land was apportioned to several other groups: Syrian, Iraqi, and Persian Jews. In the 1890s another neighborhood, Eshel Avraham, was erected next to Kirya Ne'emana for Georgian and Caucasian Jews. These neighborhoods were virtually abandoned during the 1929 Palestine riots and the homes taken over by Christians and Muslims. The remaining Jewish residents left with the Arab takeover of East Jerusalem after 1948.

Cast and Kristin Cast. The book was released on October 2, 2007 by St. Martin's Press, an extension of Macmillan Publishers. Since, it has been translated in more than 20 other languages, including Chinese, Portuguese and Romanian.Editions of Betrayed Plot Zoey has been a vampyre fledgling for only a month now and she already is the leader of the Dark Daughters and the local High Priestess in training. She has been chosen by a cat, called Nala, has a tight-knit group of friends and a claimed to be gorgeous maybe-boyfriend in Erik Night. The situation is stable when a strange string of murders among the ranks of local football players leads the police and the human media to the Tulsa House of Night. At her first parent visitation, Zoey is reunited with her family for the first time in a month. With them comes her grandmother, but is saddened to notice the stiffness of her parents, which contrasts strongly with the loving and friendly behavior of Stevie Rae's mother. Neferet comes upon their meeting and is almost immediately engaged in a religious dispute by Zoey's stepfather. In the ensuing argument, Zoey's parents vow never to come to the House of Night again, and Neferet kicks them out. The same night, Zoey witnesses Aphrodite being verbally abused by her parents and starts developing sympathy for her enemy. Later on, she chances upon Neferet scolding Aphrodite and is shocked by this new side of her mentor. That day, Neferet invites Zoey for a private dinner. Upon hearing that Zoey saw her and Aphrodite, she informs her that the latter's visions were no longer valid, as Nyx had withdrawn her gift, and advises Zoey to keep her distance. Later on, while watching TV, Zoey learns of the death of one of the high school football players whom she knew and goes on a walk to clear her head. She chances upon a crying Aphrodite who claims to have had another vision, that included Zoey's grandmother. She asks for a favor for her help and asks Zoey to take an oath. Unwilling to risk her grandmother's life, she accepts and learns that Aphrodite has seen her grandmother in a car, stuck on a collapsing local bridge, at a precise time. Zoey calls her grandmother to tell her to stay at home and then she and her friends make a call to the police about a bomb on the bridge, to keep other people away from it, around the time it was set to fall. Aphrodite's vision turns out to be true, making Zoey begin to doubt Neferet. When two of her ex- boyfriend's friends disappear and are found murdered, she begins to suspect Neferet has something to do with it, especially after witnessing her discussing the murders with \\"undead\\", supposedly deceased students in a dream. Meanwhile, Zoey must make decisions regarding her love life, as she is drawn to her ex-boyfriend Heath due to their Imprint, maintains a relationship with fledgling peer Erik Night and captures the interest of Poet Laureate and teacher Loren Blake. Zoey reorganizes the Dark Daughters, now that she is in charge of them, but Neferet takes credit for most of her new ideas at the first new Dark Daughters ritual. Shortly after the ritual, her best friend Stevie Rae rejects the Change and dies. As Zoey grieves over Stevie Rae, she learns that Heath too has disappeared, following the two other murders. Using her Imprint, a connection formed when vampyres consume a person's blood, she is able to locate him and takes off to retrieve him. She finds out that Heath is being held captive by \\"undead\\" fledglings. Using her elemental affinities, Zoey frees Heath, but also finds out that it was Neferet who changed the dying fledglings into the \\"undead\\" creatures ‚Äì one of which is Stevie Rae. The fledglings had lost their humanity and reverted to an almost feral state. She runs away with Heath, vowing to return. At the school, Neferet attempts to erase Zoey's memory, but Zoey recovers her memory and starts hatching a plan to help her former best friend. Zoey now has to use her bravery to save her best friend.

He has published articles on geopolitics, economic competition and education reforms. He served as the executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) and as chairman of The Pakistan Footwear Manufacturers Association (PFMA). Career Educated in the United States, Dr. Saleem managed equities portfolio invested in the New York Stock Exchange between 1988 until 1994. Upon returning to Pakistan, he began writing English- language analyst articles for The News International. Prior to that, he also contributed in a weekly column for the Dawn newspaper in 1996. His work has covered geopolitical dynamics involving Pakistan, India and Iran. He also authored columnist paper for the Canadian newspaper, the Vancouver Sun. In addition, Saleem has been a guest columnist for the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review and the Asia Literary Review. He has served as the CEO of Dominion Stock Funds Limited, a KSE-listed company, and later on as the executive director of the Center for Research and Security Studies (as of December 2011). Writings and advocacy =Threat Matrix and the Afghan war= Saleem has provided a critical analyses of Pakistan military's security doctrine. As President Barack Obama announced the troop evacuation from Afghanistan, Saleem published his article, Threat matrix, which Saleem argues that threat matrix has five major elements: military, nuclear, terrorist, cyber and economic. The first two threats are existential while the last two are non-existential. Saleem further argued that since the country is fighting a \\"4G War\\" where the combatants are the state of Pakistan and violent non- state actors (VNSA) from various country, the threats posed by them threaten the \\"very basis of the state and its physical existence.\\" Existential threats essentially threaten the \\"unity, demography and integrity\\" of a nation-state. In March 2013, Saleem applied his theoretical insights to analyse the \\"Kayanian Doctrine\\"‚Äî a geopolitical contingency armed program of Pakistan military built on four pillars, comprises: *American troops would have to withdraw from Afghanistan. *Reconciliation among Afghan factions is not possible without the ISI. *The Jalalabad-Torkham-Karachi route remains the most viable for withdrawing American forces. *India cannot be allowed to encircle Pakistan. Saleem observes that the doctrine has apparently put India out of the Afghan war equation but in all probability, Pakistan's security challenges are going to become even more challenging when the militants of all sorts and forms could team up in their attempt to subdue Pakistan in which Pakistan military has no contingency plan. =Pakistan's economy= =Pipedream and Game Theory= After the official bilateral signing of IPI Gas pipeline, Saleem remained sceptical towards the building the pipelines. Saleem argued that a \\"pipedream\\" is being inaugurated, not a pipeline. In 2009, Saleem published \\"Game Theory\\" and provided an explanatory thesis on mathematical \\"heptagonal game matrix\\" which, the military, the PPP, the PML-N, US the media and the judiciary as major players in the heptagon matrix. =Israel and Jews= Saleem has written about the Jewish people, Israel and its geopolitical policies. He advocated for directing a friendly-foreign policy for Israel. His most notable article, \\"Why are Jews so powerful and Muslims so powerless?\\", argues that, despite the fact that for every single Jew in the world there are 100 Muslims, Jews are more than a hundred times more powerful than all the Muslims put together. Concluding the article, Saleem pointed out that, the Muslim world is failing to diffuse knowledge.

He has been Secretary-General of MeRA25, a left-wing political party, since he founded it in 2018. A former member of Syriza, he served as Minister of Finance from January to July 2015 under Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Varoufakis was a member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens B from January to September 2015; he regained a parliamentary seat in July 2019. Varoufakis was born in Athens in 1961 and attended Moraitis School before moving to the United Kingdom, where he studied mathematics at the University of Essex before attaining a postgraduate degree in mathematical statistics at University of Birmingham and a PhD in economics at Essex. He began a career in academic economics, teaching at the universities of Essex, East Anglia and Cambridge between 1982 and 1988. Following Margaret Thatcher's third election victory in 1987, Varoufakis left the UK and moved to Australia, where he taught at the University of Sydney until 2000. After eventually acquiring Australian citizenship, he returned to Greece that year to teach at the University of Athens, where he led a doctoral program and was promoted to full professor in 2005. Following this, Varoufakis had periods of advising George Papandreou and working as the economist-in-residence for Valve before moving to the United States to teach at the University of Texas at Austin. Varoufakis has published a number of texts on economics and game theory, such as The Global Minotaur. In January 2015, Varoufakis was appointed Greek Minister of Finance. He led negotiations with Greece's creditors during the government- debt crisis. However, he failed to reach an agreement with the European troika (European Commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund) leading to the 2015 bailout referendum. The referendum rejected the troika bailout terms, and the day afterwards Varoufakis resigned as Minister of Finance, being replaced by Euclid Tsakalotos. On 24 August, Varoufakis voted against the third bailout package; in the ensuing September snap election, he did not stand for reelection. Varoufakis has since appeared in numerous debates, lectures and interviews. In February 2016, he launched the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25) and subsequently backed a Remain vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. In March 2018, he founded MeRA25, the \\"electoral wing\\" of DiEM25 in Greece. In the 2019 legislative election, MeRA25 was the sixth most voted-for party, amassing nine parliamentary seats, with Varoufakis himself returning to the Hellenic Parliament. In December 2018, Varoufakis launched the Progressive International with United States Senator Bernie Sanders. Early life and education Varoufakis was born in Palaio Faliro, Athens, on 24 March 1961, to Georgios and Eleni Varoufakis. Varoufakis's father, Georgios Varoufakis, was an Egyptiote Greek (but ultimately originating from Rethymno in Crete) who emigrated from Cairo to Greece in the 1940s, arriving in the midst of the Greek Civil War. One day, he was \\"roughed up\\" by the police and asked to sign a denunciation of communism. In response, he said: \\"Look I am not a Buddhist, but I would never sign a denunciation of Buddhism\\". He therefore ended up spending several years imprisoned on the island of Makronisos, which was used for the political re-education of people who fought on the communist side in the war. After being released in 1950, he completed his university studies and found employment as the personal assistant to the owner of Halyvourgiki, Greece's biggest steel producer. He is now, at the age of 90, Chairman of Halyvourgiki's Board of Directors. Varoufakis's mother, a student at the University of Athens School of Chemistry at the time she met Georgios, abandoned her conservative background after meeting her husband who was, at the time, allied to United Democratic Left (EDA). In the mid-1970s Eleni Varoufaki became an activist for the Women's Union of Greece, which promoted gender equality and had been set up by members of PASOK. By the early-1980s, the couple had converged politically to the same political centre-left views and engaged with the socialist PASOK. Eleni was elected Deputy Mayor of Palaio Faliro a few years before she died in 2008. Varoufakis was six years old when the military coup d'√©tat of April 1967 took place. Varoufakis later said that the military junta showed him a \\"sense of what it means to be both unfree and, at once, convinced that the possibilities for progress and improvement are endless\\". The junta collapsed when Varoufakis was in junior high school. Attending the private Moraitis School, Varoufakis decided early to spell his first name with one 'n', rather than the standard two, for \\"aesthetic\\" reasons. When his teacher gave him a low mark for that, he became angry and has continued spelling his first name with one 'n' ever since. Varoufakis finished his secondary education around 1976, when his parents deemed it too dangerous for him to continue his education in Greece. Therefore, he moved to the United Kingdom in 1978 where he entered the University of Essex. His \\"initial urge was to study physics\\" but he decided that \\"the lingua franca of political discourse was economics\\". He therefore enrolled in the economics course at Essex, but it has also been suggested that he decided to enrol in economics after meeting Andreas Papandreou. After only a few weeks of lectures, Varoufakis switched his degree to mathematics. Whilst at the University of Essex he joined a variety of political organisations including ComSoc (the University Communist Society) and the Troops Out Movement, which campaigned for a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. He also became involved with the African National Congress, Palestine Liberation Organization, and other organisations such as those in solidarity with Chile. Varoufakis was also elected as secretary of the Black Students Alliance, a choice that caused some controversy, given that he is not black, to which he responded by telling them, according to his PhD supervisor Monojit Chatterjee, \\"that black was a political term and, as a Greek, on the grounds of ethnicity he had as much reason to be there as anyone else.\\" Varoufakis also took part in student debates, where one of his rivals was John Bercow, who later became the Speaker of the House of Commons. He moved to the University of Birmingham in October 1981, obtaining an MSc in mathematical statistics in October 1982. He completed his PhD in economics in 1987 writing a thesis on Optimization and Strikes, back at the University of Essex, where his PhD supervisor was Monojit Chatterji. Academic career Varoufakis at Subversive Festival 2013 in Zagreb, Croatia Between 1982 and 1988, Varoufakis taught economics and econometrics at the University of Essex and the University of East Anglia, and also taught at the University of Cambridge. He did not wish to return to Greece for fear of conscription, and so accepted an offer to lecture at the University of Sydney, where he remained until 2000. From 1989 to 2000, he taught as senior lecturer in economics at the Department of Economics of the University of Sydney, with short stints at the University of Glasgow and the University of Louvain (UCLouvain). Varoufakis, during his time in Sydney, had his own slot on a local television show where he was critical of John Howard's conservative government. He also acquired Australian citizenship. In 2000, a combination of \\"nostalgia and abhorrence of the conservative turn of the land Down Under\\", led Varoufakis to return to Greece where he was unanimously elected an associate professor of economic theory at the University of Athens. In 2002, Varoufakis established The University of Athens Doctoral Program in Economics (UADPhilEcon), which he directed until 2008. In 2005 he was promoted to full professor of economic theory. From January 2004 to December 2006, Varoufakis served as economic advisor to George Papandreou, of whose government he was to become an ardent critic a few years later.Reuters (2015-01-28): Profile: Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis: \\"Varoufakis was an adviser to former centre-left Prime Minister George Papandreou until he resigned in 2006.\\" OECD Observer: Yanis Varoufakis (2013-03-01): \\"There is no such thing as a debt crisis\\": \\"Between 2004 and 2007 Mr Varoufakis served as economic adviser to George Papandreou, before he became Prime Minister of Greece.\\" Beginning in March 2012, Varoufakis became economist-in-residence at Valve. He researched the virtual economy on the Steam digital delivery platform, specifically looking at exchange rates and trade deficits. In June 2012, he began a blog about his research at Valve. In February 2013 his function at Valve was to work on a game for predicting trends in gaming. From January 2013 he taught at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin as a visiting professor. In November 2013, he was appointed guest professor at Stockholm University, Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, to work within game and decision theory at the Institutionen f√∂r data- och systemvetenskap (DSV) centre eGovLab at Stockholm University. In 2013, he was appointed the Athens desk editor of the online magazine WDW Review, in which he contributed until January 2015. On 22 January 2015, the International University College of Turin awarded to Varoufakis an honorary professorship in comparative law economics and finance for his extraordinary theoretical contribution to the understanding of the global economic crisis. Varoufakis is a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2015. Minister of Finance and the Syriza government (January‚ÄìAugust 2015) Varoufakis was elected to the Greek parliament, gathering the largest number of votes (more than 142 thousand) of any Greek MP, representing Syriza, and took office in the new government of Alexis Tsipras two days later, on 27 January 2015. He was appointed Finance Minister by Tsipras shortly after the election victory. The party promised to renegotiate Greece's debt and significantly curtail the austerity measures which had led to the longest recession in post-war global history. The new government had to negotiate an extension on its loan agreement, due to expire on 28 February 2015. On 04 February 2015, the ECB lifted the waiver affecting marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by Greece that until then allowed Greek banks to benefit from cheap liquidity. As a result of this decision, Greek banks, already strained by the run on deposits, had to depend on Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), which is, however, significantly more expensive than regular ECB financing. When the ECB raised the provision of ELA very modestly by 3.3 billion euro on 18 February 2015 (when outflows of deposits from Greek banks were reaching record heights), everybody knew that this was an ultimatum: either Greece should strike an agreement within days or it would have to face very serious bank problems. As in the cases of Ireland and Cyprus crises, the ELA was again used as pressure to bring about a quick agreement.Had the EU loan agreement expired without renewal, the European Central Bank would have pulled its liquidity provisions from Greece's commercial banks, ensuring that they closed their doors to the public. Varoufakis led this negotiation at the Eurogroup and with the International Monetary Fund. On 20 February, at the Eurogroup, an agreement to extend the Greek loan \\"facility\\" for four months, until 30 June 2015, was struck and Varoufakis hailed it as crucial ‚Äì because it represented a fresh start by specifying that the terms of the loan would be renegotiated and its conditions would be re-drawn on the basis of a new list of reforms to be provided by the Greek government. That list was submitted by Varoufakis on 23 February and was approved by the Eurogroup on 24 February. On those grounds, Varoufakis signed the official document by which the loan agreement's expiry date was to be extended from 28 February to 30 June 2015 ‚Äì a four-month period during which a new agreement was to be negotiated. This extension was formalized by the third amendment of the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement (MFFA), initially concluded between Greece and EFSF on 15 March 2012. The amendment is clear on two things. It changed the expiry date and also required that the ‚Ç¨10.9 billion held by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF) to cover potential bank recapitalisation and resolution costs were returned to the EFSF. This sum can now be released to Greece only on request by the ECB (in its capacity as bank supervisor). This means that the first declared goal of the Greek government, i.e. to enter a totally new arrangement and replace the financial-assistance procedures by a ‚Äúnon-technocratic‚Äù, political negotiation at high level, was not achieved. The new agreement was an extension of the old one and was governed by the same basic rules and principles. The same happened in the case of the second goal, i.e. to activate a procedure that would lead to some form of debt relief. According to the Eurogroup statement, the Greek authorities reiterated ‚Äútheir unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to all their creditors fully and timely.‚Äù At least in the short term, Greek plans for some form of debt redemption, thus, had to be shelved. Greece, however, won flexibility regarding the 2015 primary surplus target. This would be modified downwards from its previously agreed level to ‚Äútake the economic circumstances in 2015 into account.‚Äù Regarding old measures, the Greek Government had to revise its promise to cancel many of the austerity measures it heavily criticized since 2010 as an opposition party, agreeing to ‚Äúrefrain from any rollback of measures and unilateral changes to the policies and structural reforms that would negatively impact fiscal targets, economic recovery or financial stability, as assessed by the institutions.‚Äù In this context, ‚Äúeconomic recovery‚Äù is broad enough to cover any type of measure agreed upon since 2010. Finally, the agreement endorses the intention of the Greek government to give priority to rule-of-law and state-building reforms by ‚Äúimplementing long overdue reforms to tackle corruption and tax evasion, and improving the efficiency of the public sector.‚Äù Varoufakis' view on Greece's public debt, and the 2010 crisis which began as a result of the Greek governments' inability to fund it, was that EU bailouts were attempts to take on the largest loan in history on condition of austerity measures that would shrink the incomes from which old, un-serviceable loans and new bailout debts would have to be repaid. Varoufakis argued that the \\"bailout\\" loans of 2010 and 2012, before restructuring the debt properly and putting in place a developmental program (including reforming the oligarchy, creating a development bank and dealing with the banks' non-performing loans) would lead to deeper bankruptcy, a great depression and a harder default in the future. His explanation of why the troika of Greece's lenders (the IMF, the ECB, and the European Commission) insisted on these bailout loans was that they represented a transfer of losses from the private banks to Greece's and Europe's taxpayers. In his view, the 20 February 2015 Eurogroup agreement that he negotiated, \\"was an excellent opportunity to move forward.\\" However, this view was not shared by the Eurozone countries or the wider financial community. The ECB had prevented the Greek Government from raising money cheaply and had also forced Greek banks to rely on expensive ELA funding. In other words, the Eurozone had signalled that 'strict conditionality' would apply and that Greece would face a Banking collapse if it did not comply. Thus, it was abundantly clear, the troika of lenders were not happy to let the new Greek government change the previous terms of the agreement, nor to agree to a debt restructuring. Varoufakis claims that, soon after the extension was granted at the end of February, the troika reneged on its alleged promise to consider a new fiscal and reform program for Greece, demanding of the Greek government that it implement the old one (which the Syriza government was elected to re-write). However, a promise to consider a request can also be a polite way of saying that after due consideration the request will be denied. In March 2015, the Wall Street Journal pointed to several tensions between Greece and the other Eurozone countries, saying that some countries feel they have taken the \\"tough medicine\\" and the ‚Ç¨195 billion owed is not insignificant. Further, they stated other governments have philosophical differences with Varoufakis and his Anglosphere and Keynesian leanings. Peter Ludlow said Varoufakis and his colleagues \\"turned instinctively... to the U.K. and the U.S. even before they called on the European Left.\\" In a discussion with Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz on invitation of U.S. economic think tank Institute for New Economic Thinking, Varoufakis stated on 9 April 2015 that \\"the Greek state does not have the capacity to develop public assets.\\" Therefore, he announced that his government was \\"restarting the privatization process.\\" However, unlike the former governments they would insist on establishing public‚Äìprivate partnerships with the state retaining a minority stake to generate state revenues. They would also require a minimum investment on behalf of the bidder, and \\"decent working conditions\\" for workers., live stream, 9 April 2015 Varoufakis also said that although the government needed to avoid a primary budget deficit, the bailout program's target of a surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP was outlandish and should be reduced to no more than 1.5 percent. After many weeks of negotiations during which the Greek government, often against Varoufakis' advice, made many concessions to the troika of Greece's lenders, no agreement was in sight. One reason was that the members of the troika did not have a unified position. For example, the IMF insisted that the Greek government's demand for a public debt restructure should be granted so that their own money could be returned to them while the other creditors ate the loss, while powerful finance ministers in the Eurogroup (Germany's, for instance) refused this because they did not want to eat the loss. Another alleged reason was that, with elections approaching in Spain, Ireland, and Portugal, various politicians within the EU did not want to see Greece's radical new government emerge as successful though, of course, if Greece had succeeded in paying them back their money they would have been delighted. Moreover, the differences in economic ideology- in particular the ideological opposition to losing money- will have contributed to the lack of progress towards a mutually-agreeable solution- for example one where a beautiful fairy gave everybody lots of money. On 25 June 2015, Varoufakis was presented with an ultimatum in the Eurogroup. It included a fiscal proposal, a reform agenda, and a funding formula that Varoufakis, his government, and several other ministers of finance sitting in the Eurogroup, considered to be non-viable. The next day, the Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, called for a referendum on the Eurogroup's proposal on 5 July. On 27th July, in Brussels, Varoufakis asked for a one month extension. He said, according to his own tape recording of the meeting, 'The question is very simple, there is a proposal by the institutions (i.e. the Troika). The institutions worked very hard to come up with it. We could not bring ourselves to signing it for reasons I have explained, it is up to the Greek people to decide. The suggestion that we‚Äôre coming to you with is that a one-month extension is offered of the existing arrangement so as to allow a smooth transition from today to the 6th of July so as to allow the Greek people, in calmness to deliberate, to consider the proposal which is in front of them, and to make a considered judgment on that basis.' The Irish Finance Minister responded by pointing out that a run of the Greek banks and ATMs had begun. The German representative confirmed that there would be no extension. Greece would face a Banking crisis. It was left to Luis de Guindos to turn down Varoufakis's plea for an extension by pointing out that calling a referendum was scarcely a confidence building measure precisely because the gap between the Greek and the Troika's position was bridgeable. This showed there was no 'contagion risk'. Greece was welcome to destroy itself, nobody else would be affected. Mario Draghi and Christine Lagard, on behalf of the ECB and the IMF respectively, confirmed that Greece was on its own though any other affected party could get help. In other words, Greece, simply by calling the referendum, had lost Institutional support. It was on its own. On 5 July 2015, the bailout referendum took place. Varoufakis had campaigned vigorously in favour of the 'No' vote, against the united support for the 'Yes' of Greece's media. To make his position clear, he declared on television that he would resign as finance minister if Greeks voted 'Yes'. The outcome of the vote was a resounding 61.5 percent vote in favour of 'No'. Varoufakis went on television, soon after the result was announced, and declared that the government was determined to honour this new mandate for a different agreement with its creditors. However, a few hours later, Varoufakis resigned. In his resignation statement the following morning he claimed that \\"other European participants\\" had expressed a wish for his absence. Later he explained that he decided to resign during a meeting with the prime minister, on the night of the referendum, during which he discovered that the prime minister, instead of being energised by the \\"No\\" vote, declared to Varoufakis his decision to acquiesce to the troika's terms. Unwilling to sign such a \\"surrender\\" document, Varoufakis chose to resign. His explanation, published later by Harry Lambert, New Statesman, 13 July 2015, was this: \\"I'm not going to betray my own view, that I honed back in 2010, that this country must stop extending and pretending, we must stop taking on new loans pretending that we've solved the problem, when we haven't; when we have made our debt even less sustainable on condition of further austerity that even further shrinks the economy; and shifts the burden further onto the have nots, creating a humanitarian crisis. It's something I'm not going to accept, I'm not going to be party to.\\" Yet, the fact is Varoufakis asked twice for an extension from creditors. In a 16 July teleconference with private investors that was later made public, Varoufakis described a five-month clandestine project he ran as finance minister involving hacking into Greece's independent tax service's computers. The project's goal was to develop a parallel payment system that could be implemented as a contingency plan if the Greek system failed, and was dubbed \\"Plan B\\". In it, individuals' private identification numbers were accessed and copied to a computer controlled by a \\"childhood friend\\" of Varoufakis. On Friday 14 August, the government (without Varoufakis) pushed successfully through parliament the third Greek bailout agreement. The bailout bill received 222 votes to 64 (as the conservative opposition voted in favour). Up to 40 Syriza members including Varoufakis voted against the bailout. Just prior to that vote, Varoufakis rose in parliament to offer the Prime Minister of Greece his resignation from his parliamentary seat, saying that this was the only way he knew how to combine his strong opposition to the new bailout with loyalty to the party and the prime minister. On 20 August, the prime minister himself resigned and called a snap election due to the loss of support from rebelling Syriza MPs. Varoufakis had already declared that he was not interested in standing again for Syriza. At the same time, Syriza announced that any MP who voted against the bailout package would not be standing for the party. Varoufakis did not go on to represent Popular Unity, unlike many of his ex-Syriza colleagues, as he considered the party too isolationist. Varoufakis chose not to stand in the election, saying he would focus on creating a European network that would 'restor[e] democracy' in Europe. A month later, the national election was held and despite a low voter turnout, Tsipras and his Syriza Party won just over 35 percent of the vote. Combining with the Independent Greeks Party, a majority was achieved and Tsipras was returned to power. =Commentary on appointment= The Adam Smith Institute, a leading free-market think tank in the United Kingdom, \\"enthusiastically\\" supported Varoufakis's debt-swap plan and asked the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to support it. Varoufakis had proposed debt swap measures, including bonds pegged to economic growth, which would replace the existing bonds of the European bailout programme. Bloomberg said that Varoufakis was a \\"brilliant economist\\", but he had difficult interactions with other politicians and the media. Galbraith, referring to Varoufakis's expertise in game theory, has said that he knows as much about this subject \\"as anyone on the planet\\", and that \\"[he] will be thinking more than a few steps ahead\\" in any interactions with the troika. Two weeks later, Varoufakis wrote an op-ed in The New York Times saying that using game theory would be \\"pure folly\\" and that he wanted to \\"shun any temptation to treat this pivotal moment as an experiment in strategizing and, instead, to present honestly the facts concerning Greece's social economy\\".  Later political career (2015‚Äìpresent)  In September 2015, Varoufakis appeared on the British topical debate show, Question Time, and was praised for his performance by Mark Lawson in The Guardian, who wrote: \\"...several of the sentences he spoke in a second language were more impressive than most that his fellow panellists managed in their native tongue.\\" He appeared on the show again in October 2016 and March 2019. Varoufakis attended an event in London hosted by The Guardian on 23 October 2015, where he spoke about the UK's upcoming European Union membership referendum. He said that the UK should remain in the EU, but also campaign to democratise it: \\"My message is simple yet rich: those of us who disdain the democratic deficit in Brussels, those of us who detest the authoritarianism of a technocracy which is incompetent and contemptuous of democracy, those of us who are most critical of Europe have a moral duty to stay in Europe, fight for it, and democratise it.\\" He would return to the UK, in May 2016, in the final stages of the campaigning to again urge a remain vote. On 9 February 2016, Varoufakis launched the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25) at the Volksb√ºhne in Berlin. In March 2016, Varoufakis publicly supported the idea of a basic income. On 2 April 2016, in reaction to tension between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the IMF, Varoufakis said there was underway \\"an attrition war between a reasonably numerate villain (the IMF) and a chronic procrastinator (Berlin)\\" as to Greek debt relief. In March 2018, Varoufakis announced the launch of his own political party, MeRA 25, with a stated aim of freeing Greece from \\"debt bondage\\". He stated that he hoped the party would be based on an alliance of \\"people of the left and liberalism, greens and feminists\\". The party, whose name stands for \\"European Realistic Disobedience Front\\", is affiliated to DiEM25. On 25 November 2018, Varoufakis was selected to head the list of Democracy in Motion (the German section of DiEM25) for the 2019 European elections. but he is not elected as DiEM25 lists failed to elect a single MEP . = Progressive International = On 20 August 2018, in an on-stage book festival interview in Edinburgh, Varoufakis pressed Jeremy Corbyn, head of the British Labour Party, to \\"be a bit more ambitious\\" and become involved in the international progressive movement, saying \\"We need a progressive international\\". On 13 September, Varoufakis penned an op-ed piece in The Guardian about the need for an international progressive movement, alongside a similar piece by fellow progressive U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. On 26 October in Rome, Varoufakis announced the Progressive International, which was described as a \\"common blueprint for an International New Deal, a progressive New Bretton Woods\\". The organization officially launched on 30 November in Sanders' home town of Burlington, Vermont. = Re-election = On 7 July 2019, his party MeRA25 passed the threshold necessary to enter the Greek parliament and Varoufakis was re-elected an MP. In November 2019, along with other public figures, Varoufakis signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \\"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Corbyn's leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that \\"Labour's election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.\\" Personal life Varoufakis is married to installation artist Danae Stratou, who is rumored to be the subject of the Pulp song Common People, and has a daughter who is growing up in Sydney, from his first marriage to academic Margarite Anagnostopoulou (Poulos). Works Varoufakis is the author of several books on the European debt crisis, the financial imbalance in the world and game theory. He is also a recognised speaker and often appears as an analyst for national news media. A film based on his book Adults in the Room directed by Costa-Gavras was released in 2019. Varoufakis himself is portrayed by actor Christos Loulis. =A Modest Proposal= In November 2010, he and Stuart Holland, a former British Labour Party MP and economics professor at the University of Coimbra (Portugal), published A Modest Proposal, a set of economic policies aimed at overcoming the euro crisis.Yanis Varoufakis: Euro Crisis In 2013, Version 4.0 of A Modest Proposal appeared with the American economist James K. Galbraith as a third co-author. This version was published in late 2013 in French with a supporting foreword by Michel Rocard, former Prime Minister of France. , Truman Factor features select articles by Varoufakis in English and in Spanish.Russell Shorto: The Way Greeks Live Now. In: The New York Times. 13 February 2012 =The Global Minotaur= First published in 2011, The Global Minotaur constructs a historical narrative and metaphor which Varoufakis uses to describe the world economy from the mid-1970s to the 2008 crash and beyond. He argues that the global economy since the 1970s can be viewed as being built around the financing of the twin deficits of the United States ‚Äì its trade deficit and government deficit. Varoufakis argues that the United States powered the global economy by consuming the exports of the rest of the world, and then the surpluses flowed back to the United States by going to institutions on Wall Street or being used to buy U.S. Treasury debt. He suggests the recycling back to the U.S. happened naturally due to the status of the dollar as the global reserve currency, and because of the profitability of U.S. corporations and returns on Wall Street. However, when the U.S. economy and banking system faltered in 2008, the United States' ability to consume vast quantities of imports decreased, and investing in Wall Street became a much less inviting prospect, so the system seized up. This explains why the 2008 recession was felt so heavily around the world. The metaphor of the Minotaur is used as Varoufakis characterizes the flows back to the U.S. as a \\"tribute\\" to a great power. =Books in English= * Talking to My Daughter About the Economy.

The temple is dedicated to Hindu deity Narasimha, who is avatar of Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi. From the days of glory and grandeur that prevailed in South India the temple of Lakhsmi Narasimha at Narasingapuram still boasts the era of Cholas and Vijayanagara Rayas. The Lakshmi Narasimha Temple is situated in the village of Narasingapuram in trichy district. History left In the early period of Cholas Saivism took prominence and Vaishnavism was suppressed by it. Even amidst the situation prevailed in South India the temple of Lakshmi Narasimha enjoyed patronage and was well governed. Later at the glorious era of Vijayanagara nayaks where Vaishnavism flourished and given much importance in both politics and as a religion, the Lakhsmi Narasimha temple became important along with Sriperumbudur(Ramanujar Temple) though both are not in 108 Divyadesam. And the temple is also nearer to sriperumbudur. Vijayanagara Nayak Emperors patronised it and gave many villages as charter to the temple‚Äôs development and as well as the religion. The temple, a fine specimen of the Vijayanagar style of architecture with delicately sculpted and carved pillars . Architecture in the temple made one think that it belonged to the Vijayanagar period, there are inscriptions dating back to the reign of Chola kings. Archaeologists consider those inscriptions in the Andal shrine basement as more ancient and belonging to the period of Kulothunga Chozha I and Vikrama Chozha I. They speak about their constructing the Madurantaka Vinnagar temple in Madurantaka Nalloor (the present Madurantakam) and installing the idols of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana in it and the grants made by them for the daily conduct of poojas. Inscriptions There are as many as 14 inscriptions in and around the temple in which two of them belong to the Chola period. And this stands evidence that the temple even survived the Saivism wave that took effect under the Cholas in the early period like many other important Vaishnavite temples that survived it in South India in the early period. The 12 stone inscriptions that are found in the temple dates back to the Vijayanagar period describe about the glorious past of temple and the Emperors. Most of the inscriptions belong to the reign of Emperor Atchudha Deva Maharaya describing about the donations and renovating construction led by his government at the temple. In those five important inscriptions belong to the years of A.D. 1533, 1534 and 1536 which are some of the important years of his rule. Emperor Atchudha Deva Maharaya is the younger brother of Krishna Devaraya whose reign was considered to be the golden period of south Indian history. One inscription belongs to the reign of Venkatapathy Deva Maharaya describing about his esteemed work for the temple. It dates back to the year 1608 and also considered to be the latest inscription to be found in the temple premises. All these inscriptions are in Sanscritised Telugu which is still a local language prevailing in the surrounding areas of Narasingapuram. Religious Significance Lak narasimhar The deity also has the name 'Sri Kalyana Lakshmi Narasimhar' since holds Lordess Lakshmi closely (Aalinganam). The Periya Thiruvadi (Garudazhwar) is about four feet heigh and about sixteen serpents adore his body as jewels. Those who worship this temple for about nine Swathi Nakshatirams are entitled with complete bliss with respect to health and wealth and any associated problems in those vanishes. The Perumal is also called 'Sri Kalyana Lakshmi Narasimhar' as he performs 'aalinganam' - holding Sri Lakshmi very closely. Periya Thiruvadi - Garudalwar, is about 4 feet high and 16 nagams (snakes) are found in his body as ornaments. It is believed that by continuously worshipping this Narasimhar for nine Swathi nakshathiram days, all wealth/health problems, obstacles in marriage etc., will vanish. Lord Narasimhar here appears as Shantha moorthy and has a smiling face. In the temple, Mahalakshmi in the lap of Narasimhar is facing the devotees and blessing them..In case of Ugra Narasimhar temples, Mahalakshmi is seen facing the lord trying to pacify the lord's anger. The posture of Narasimhar and Mahalakshmi is called \\"Paraspara Alinganman\\" meaning both of them are embracing each other as compared to other temples where only Mahalakshmi appears in an embracing posture. Garudan here has 16 types of snakes around and hence the devotees are freed of Naga dosham. Etymology Lak_narasimhar temple before renovation An old inscription in the Lakhsmi Narasimha temple which describes about the establishment of the presiding deity‚Äôs Urchavar idol Prahaladha Purandhara that is named after the lord‚Äôs avathar purport says \\" Narasinga perumal temple is situated in the village of Narasa Nayakar Puram that is nearby Coovam (age old chola era saivist temple village) and under the jurisdiction of the Jayamkonda Chola Mandalam of Chandragiri kingdom‚Äôs southernmost part. The name of Narasa Nayakar Puram has become Narasingapuram in the later period because of colloquial reference of the village to the temple and its deity.

He made several documentaries about the Holocaust, winning several awards, both in Britain and abroad.  Early years  Born Peter Meyer to Jewish parents, Alice and Willy Meyer, a wholesaler and exporter in Germany, he fled the Nazis in 1933 at the age of nine with his brother Tommy and his sister (future Registrar of the Warburg Institute and literary executor of Arnaldo Momigliano). His parents had already decided the family should leave Germany, but when Adolf Hitler was made chancellor of Germany, plans were put into action.Peter Morley (2006), p. 2 His parents learned that the Landschulheim Herrlingen, a progressive, co-educational school in Ulm was moving to England and he and his siblings were accepted.

Programmes were turned around quickly, from inception to production and broadcast. In February 1959, Morley and former Fleet Street journalist Cyril Bennett interviewed Paula Hitler, as well as Hitler's adjutant, chauffeur and pilot, the only interviews they ever gave.

It is connected by Roads 418 and 535 which both link with the main Highway 65 which connects Riyadh to Buraidah which is about 101 kilometres by road to west of Al Zulfi. Zulfi also forms a governorate of Riyadh Province. The Al- Yamama/Tuwaiq mountain range begins in the desert to the north of Al Zulfi. Location Az Zulfi is in the East of Al-Qassim Province and at the heart of the historical region of Najd. It is located roughly 70kilometers from Buraydah (the capital of the province) and more than 290 kilometers north of the Saudi capital, Riyadh. History =Early history= Although the location is sometimes identified with an ancient settlement mentioned by Yaqut and Al-Hamadani known as \\"oryarh\\",the history of zulfi proper dates back to the 3th century. According to the chroniclers of Nejd. During the Pre-Islamic era the settlement at the site was called zulifit or alkrm (), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of Banu Hanifa & Banu tmym.History of Riyadh at www.arriyadh.com Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al Yamamah, whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern Arabia during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the Abbasid Empire in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital from Hajr to nearby Al Kharj. The city then went into a long period of decline. In the 14th century, North African traveller Ibn Battuta wrote of his visit to Hajr, describing it as \\"the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr\\". Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its inhabitants belonging to Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their leader to Mecca to perform the Hajj. Later on, Hajr broke up into several separate settlements and estates. The most notable of these were Migrin (or Muqrin) and Mi'kal, though the name Hajr continued to appear in local folk poetry. The earliest known reference to the area by the name Riyadh comes from a 17th-century chronicler reporting on an event from the year 1590. In 1737, Deham ibn Dawwas, a refugee from neighboring Manfuha, took control of Riyadh. Ibn Dawwas built a single wall to encircle the various quarters of Riyadh, making them effectively a single town. =The three Saudi states= And dating to the late 19th century Zulfi architecture XI Hijri approximately 1090 e by alasaadh clan of Talha with thigh elrokh by tribe Otaiba known (al rashd & lfrahid) of offspring Rashid Mohammed and Saleh Rashid sons farhud Assadi.the Principality llasaadh to Crown modern and recorded some dates old Al najdiyah events and facts to them and had them thanks in helping reconstruction and received from them a lot of development and progress in all fields and areas, and saw them through major Renaissance and strong growth over the last decade gained admiration from her family and many surrounding cities and has been and continues to be a beacon and example role models, to join all efforts together and one collective spirit and generations believed for years and now need to move seriously towards Access to refineries and Zulfi mattresses delivered social progress and civilization Battle of Sabilla The Battle of Sabilla (March 29, 1929) was the main battle of the Ikhwan Revolt in northern Arabia between the rebellious Ikhwan forces and the army of Ibn Saud. It was the last major battle, where one side rode camels, as the Ikhwan emphasized radical conservatism, shunned technological modernization. The rebellious, but technologically mediocre, Ikhwan were decisively defeated by the Saudi forces, which included machine- guns and cavalry. Faisal al-Dawish, one of the three leaders of the rebellious Ikhwan tribes, was wounded in the battle. According to Ibn Saud Information Resource, his injury was \\"serious\\". Sultan bin Bajad, allegedly fled the battle scene. On January 9, 2005, Saudi forces reportedly killed four gunmen in a gun battle in Al Zulfi. Three security officials were injured in the event. Senior al-Qaeda leader Khalid al-Juwayr was captured by the security forces in al-Zulfi. Geography Al Zulfi lies in the northern-central region of the Najd and to the south of the sheayb samnan (samnan Valley), which is the longest valley on the zulfi. It is surrounded by sand dunes to its north and west, which are known locally as the Al-Thoyr Sands. The Al-sabalh Woods are located to the north of the city. Next to Al Zulfi is the Al-Kasar Rain lake (or bohyrat Al-Kasar), which is considered an official part of the city. =Climate= Being in the middle of the Arabian desert, Al Zulfi experiences extremely hot summers and relatively cool winters. Humidity is low though throughout the year. The minimum temperature in the summer ranges between 35-42 degrees Celsius. The species Bunopus spatalurus spatalurus of the Bunopus genus of small geckos was described in 1991 as being endemic to the area. In Al Zulfi, there is a desert climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification is BWh. The average annual temperature in Al Zulfi is . About of precipitation falls annually. Notable landmarks Al Zulfi contains numerous mosques and parks. It also contains a 150-bed hospital and the Palace of Prince Saud bin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad bin Saud. The Al Zulfi Governorate contains 2 national parks. Al-Zulfi has three artificial lakes due to the problems of water salinization. Al Zulfi is noted for its many wells and fertile soils with many thousands of acres of land under cultivation. There are also coal reserves in the area, especially in the northeast near Qasim. The thickness of the deposits range from 5 to 50 metres and are spread over a vast area with some 66 coal mines discovered in the Qassim area by the early 1980s.

The film was the first sound version based on Daksha yajna, the story of Daksha.  Plot  Sati, the daughter of Daksha, a descendant of Brahma, marries Shiva against the wish of her father. This annoys the king (Daksha) and he performs a yagna to insult Shiva, where he invites all gods except his son-in-law (Shiva). Sati attends this sacrifice against the wishes of Shiva and is insulted by her father. Unable to bear this, Sati kills herself by burning in the fire. Shiva destroys Daksha's sacrifice through Virabhadra, cuts off Daksha's head and replaces it with that of a goat, and restores his life. Later he picks up the remain of Sati's body and performs \\"Rudra Thandavam\\", a dance that will lead to the destruction of Universe, but the other gods intervene, and the Disc of Vishnu cuts through the Sati's corpse. Her body parts, known as Shakthi Peetas, fall in several places on the Indian subcontinent.  Cast  * V. A. Chellappa as Shiva * M. M. Radhabai * M. G. Nataraja Pillai * K. R. Jayalakshmi * P. G.

It is sometimes called the blue spiny starfish or the white starfish. It occurs in shallow waters in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Description Coscinasterias tenuispina has from 6 to 12 arms (usually 7), often of varying lengths, and grows to 20 cm (8 in) in diameter. It is a creamy, slightly bluish colour, variously blotched with brown, and is rough textured with short spines.Marine Species: Coscinasterias tenuispina Skaphandrus.com. Retrieved 2011-09-28. Distribution The range of Coscinasterias tenuispina includes the Mediterranean Sea, France, Spain and Portugal, the Azores and other Atlantic Islands, Bermuda, Cuba and the American coast between North Carolina and Santos, Brazil. It is found on the lower shore and down to a depth of about 50 m (160 ft). A number of divergent populations of the starfish in the Atlantic and Mediterranean are believed to be deserving of being recognized as sub-species. The female population of the starfish in the Mediterranean is larger than that of the males. Biology Coscinasterias tenuispina is a predator and an omnivore. The starfish is found on hard bottoms and under stones and seaweed where it mainly feeds on other echinoderms and on bivalve molluscs.Blue spiny starfish: Coscinasterias tenuispina Archipelagos Wildlife Library. Retrieved 2011-09-28. In most of its range, it undergoes sexual reproduction in the winter, while in the summer, it proliferates by asexual reproduction. To begin the process of asexual reproduction, or \\"fission\\", the disc tears itself into two sections, with each part eventually growing extra arms and developing into a new individual. In Brazil, all individuals seem to be male and fission occurs throughout the year.

During June 1992, the villagers, who were mostly tribals, prevented forest and revenue officials from entering the hamlet. The officials complained that the villagers were involved in sandalwood smuggling and aiding Veerappan, a notorious forest brigand. During the evening, 269 officials, being 155 forest personnel, 108 policemen and six revenue officials, raided the village and herded the villagers under a tree. A hundred men from the village were brutally assaulted while 18 women were gangraped. The raid continued for two days when the hamlet was demolished.

The name of this village has been derived from the famous historical Lakshmi Narasimhar Temple is believed to have been built in the 16th century during the Vijayanagara era which is nearly 1500 years ago. Lakshmi Narasimhar is said to be Varapprasadhi(gives varam(boon) ask for). Woosu Automotive India, a Korean automobile parts production company, is also located in this village. History In the early period of Cholas Saivism took prominence and Vaishnavism was suppressed by it. Even amidst the situation prevailed in south India the temple of Lakhsmi Narasimha enjoyed patronage and was well governed. Later at the glorious era of Vijayanagara nayaks where Vaishnavism flourished and given much importance in both politics and as a religion, the Lakshmi Narasimhar Temple became important along with sriperumbudur which is a Divya desam. And the temple is also nearer to sriperumbudur. Vijayanagara Nayak Emperors patronised it and gave many villages as charter to the temple‚Äôs development and as well as the religion. An old inscription in the Lakshmi Narasimhar Temple which describes about the establishment of the presiding deity‚Äôs Urchavar idol Prahaladha Purandhara that is named after the lord‚Äôs avathar purport says \\"Narasinga perumal\\" temple is situated in the village of Narasa Nayakar Puram that is nearby Coovam (age old chola era saivist temple village) and under the jurisdiction of the Jayamkonda Chola Mandalam of Chandragiri kingdom‚Äôs southernmost part. The name of Narasa Nayakar Puram has now become Narasingapuram in the later period because of colloquial reference of the village to the temple and its deity. Lakshmi Narasimhar normally with an angry exterior but here with a smiling face and is referred to as Shaantha Moorthy. Unlike in other Narasimha Kshetrams, Thaayar is seen directly facing the devotees and blessing them.

At the end of his life he became the Cambridge Regius Professor of Physic. Life The son of Francis Winterton, he was born at Lutterworth, Leicestershire. He was sent to Eton College, and on 3 June 1617 was elected scholar of King's College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow on 3 June 1620. He matriculated in the university on 5 July 1617, graduated B.A. 1620, M.A. 1624. Suffering from sleeplessness and melancholia, he consulted the Regius Professor of Physic, Dr. John Collins, who advised him to give up mathematics, at which he was then working, and to study medicine, advice Winterton followed. In 1625 Winterton was a candidate for the professorship of Greek, when Robert Creighton, who had for some time been deputy, was elected. Winterton then petitioned the visitor of King's College in May 1629, and on 20 August was formally diverted to the study of physic, which he had already pursued for four years. He received the university license to practise medicine in 1631, and on 16 September in that year petitioned King's College to grant him the degree of M.D. under its statutes. His request was refused, but was urged by John Hacket, writing from Buckden Palace on 25 January 1632, on behalf of the bishop of Lincoln, and by Bishop John Williams himself on 28 June 1632, as well as by the Earl of Holland on 28 November 1633, but all without effect. Some acrid theological discussion seems to have been the ground for these refusals. A letter of 12 December 1633 from Archbishop William Laud, to Samuel Collins, Provost of King's, saw the degree granted within two weeks. The book Hippocratis Magni Aphorismi led to Winterton's appointment as Regius Professor of Physic in 1635. The course for the M.D. degree was then twelve years, and efforts were often made to obtain incorporation after graduation in other universities. These he put a stop to, as he announces in a letter, dated 25 August 1635, to Dr. Simeon Foxe, then president of the College of Physicians. He died on 13 September 1636 at Cambridge, and was buried at the east end of King's College chapel. Works ;Medical He made a Greek metrical version of the first books of the aphorisms of Hippocrates in 1631, and early in 1633 published at Cambridge, with a dedication to William Laud, at that time bishop of London, ‚ÄòHippocratis Magni Aphorismi Soluti et Metrici.‚Äô Each aphorism is given in the original with the Latin version of Johannes Heurnius of Utrecht, and is rendered into Latin verse and Greek verse. The Latin verses are by John Fryer, president of the College of Physicians in 1549, whose name appears on the title-page. The seven books of aphorisms are followed by epigrams in Latin or Greek in praise of Winterton's work by the regius professors of medicine at Cambridge and Oxford; by the president and seventeen fellows of the College of Physicians, of whom fourteen were Cantabrigians and three Oxonians; by Francis Glisson, afterwards professor of physic; by members of every college at Cambridge but one; by the professor of astronomy and members of several colleges at Oxford, concluding with twenty epigrams by members of King's College. Laudatory opinions in prose by the masters of Peterhouse, Christ's, and Trinity, and the president of Queens', and by two professors of divinity are prefixed. ;Other works In 1627 Winterton translated Johann Gerhard's ‚ÄòMeditations,‚Äô in which he was encouraged by John Bowle; they were printed at Cambridge in 1631, and reached a fifth edition in 1638. His brother Francis was one of six hundred volunteers, commanded by the Marquis of Hamilton, who went to serve under Gustavus Adolphus, and his death at Castrin in Silesia in 1631 depressed Winterton; he sought relief by translating the Considerations of Drexelius upon Eternitie of Jeremias Drexel, which was published at the Cambridge University press in 1636, and of which subsequent editions appeared in 1650 and 1658, 1675, 1684, 1703, 1705, and 1716. In 1632 he also translated and printed at Cambridge A Golden Chaine of Divine Aphorismes by Johann Gerhard. It contains commendatory verses in English by Edward Benlowes of St. John's College, and by four fellows of his own college, Dore Williamson, Robert Newman, Henry Whiston, and Thomas Page. In 1633 he published at Cambridge an edition of Terence, and an edition of the Greek poem of Dionysius Periegetes, De Situ Orbis, with a dedication in Greek verse to Sir Henry Wotton, Provost of Eton. While preparing the Greek aphorisms he also worked on an edition of the Poet√¶ minores Gr√¶ci, based upon those of Henry Stephen (1566) and Jean Crispin (1600), with observations of his own on Hesiod. The book was published at Cambridge in 1635, with a dedication to Archbishop Laud, and subsequent editions appeared in 1652, 1661, 1671, 1677, 1684, 1700, and 1712. He published at Cambridge in 1631 Greek verses at the end of William Buckley's Arithmetica Memorativa, and in 1635 verses in Carmen Natalitium, and in Genethliacum Academi√¶. Legacy Winterton made his will on 25 August 1636, leaving bequests to his father, mother, brothers John, Henry, and William, and sisters Mary, Barbara, Fenton, and Ruth. To his brother John, who was a student of medicine at Christ's College, Cambridge and who wrote verses in ‚ÄòCarmen Natalitium,‚Äô he gave the medical works of Daniel Sennertus in six volumes and of Martin Rulandus, and the surgery of William Clowes the younger, with his anatomy instruments.

There is Italian Union of Croatia and Slovenia, in Croat Talijanska Unija, in Slovene Italijanska Unija, which is Croat-Slovene organization with main site in Fiume-Rijeka and secondary site in Capodistria-Koper of Slovenia. There are two main groups of Italians in Croatia, based on geographical origin: * Istrian Italians * Dalmatian Italians According to the 2011 Croatian census, Italians of Croatia number 17,807, or 0.42% of the total Croatian population. They mostly reside in the county of Istria. 2011 Croatian census , the Italian language is officially used in twenty cities and municipalities and ten other settlements in Croatia, according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.  History  The Italians of Croatia are the descendants of the Dalmatians and Istrians (neo-Latin peoples originating in the Middle Ages from the Romanized Illyrians) and of the Venetians transplanted to the overseas Adriatic territories of the Serenissima. In the last two centuries some Italians have also moved from Italian peninsula, as in the case of Apulian emigrants in Ragusa and Trentino in Pozega. In Istria there are still large communities of Italians (about 7% of the population), while in Dalmatia there are only small Italian groups of modest numbers, the last evidence of a presence that descends directly from the Romance-speaking populations that survived the Slavic invasions . The Italian community at the beginning of the twentieth century was still very substantial, being a majority in the most important Istrian coastal centers and in some centers in Kvarner and Dalmatia. According to the Austrian censuses, which collected the declarations relating to the language of use in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910, in the Istrian geographical region - which differed from the Marquisate of Istria in that the main Kvarner islands were added to the latter - Italian speakers spoke from 37.59% (1910) to 41.66% (1880) of the total population, concentrated in the western coastal areas where they also reached 90%. In Dalmatia, however, they were quite numerous only in the main cities, such as Zadar (the only Dalmatian mainland where they were majority), Split, Trogir, Sibenik, Ragusa and Kotor, and in some islands such as Krk, Cres, Lo≈°inj, Rab, Lissa and Brazza. In these they were majorities in the centers of Cres, Mali Lo≈°inj, Veli Lo≈°inj and, according to the 1880 census, in the cities of Krk and Rab. In Rijeka the Italians were the relative majority in the municipality (48.61% in 1910), and in addition to the large Croatian community (25.95% in the same year), there was also a fair Hungarian minority (13.03%). Austrian linguistic map of 1896, on which the boundaries (marked with blue dots) of Venetian Dalmatia in 1797 are shown. In orange are highlighted the areas where the most common mother tongue was Italian, while in green those where the Slavic languages With the awakening of national consciences (second half of the nineteenth century), the struggle between Italians and Slavs for dominion over Istria and Dalmatia began. The Italian community in Dalmatia was almost canceled by this clash between opposing nationalisms, which saw several stages: * Between 1848 and 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Empire - particularly after the loss of Veneto following the Third War of Independence (1866) - favored the establishment of the Slavic ethnic group to counter the irredentism (true or presumed) of the Italian population. During the meeting of the council of ministers on November 12, 1866, Emperor Franz Joseph fully outlined a wide-ranging plan in this regard: The policy of collaboration with the local Serbs, inaugurated by the Tsaratino Ghiglianovich and the Raguseo Giovanni Avoscani, then allowed the Italians to conquer the municipal administration of Ragusa in 1899. In 1909 the Italian language was prohibited, however, in all public buildings and Italians they were ousted from the municipal administrationsDizionario Enciclopedico Italiano (Vol. III, p. 730), Roma, Ed. Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, founded by Giovanni Treccani, 1970. These interferences, together with other aiding actions to the Slavic ethnic group considered by the empire more faithful to the crown, exacerbated the situation by feeding the most extremist and revolutionary currents. * After the First World War, with the annexation of most of Dalmatia to Yugoslavia, the exodus of some thousands of Italian Dalmatians to Zadar and Italy occurred. Italian citizenship was granted to the few remaining, concentrated mainly in Split and Ragusa following the Treaty of Rapallo (1920). Zara, whose population was mostly Italian (66.29% in the city of Zara, according to the census of 1910), was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy together with Istria in 1920. Fiume was annexed to Italy in 1924. * For a short period during the invasion of Yugoslavia (1941-1943) the Governatorate of Dalmatia was inserted in the Kingdom of Italy, with three provinces: Zadar, Split and Kotor. * After the Second World War, all Dalmatia and almost all of Istria were annexed to Yugoslavia. Most Italians took the road of exodus, which ran from 1943 until the late 1950s. The Italians who remained in Yugoslavia, gathered in the Italian Union, were recognized as a national minority, with their own flag.  Italian community in Croatia today  Italian-speaking percentage in Croatia divided by municipality, according to the Croatian census of 2011Croatian Bureau of Statistics - Census of Population, Householdes and Dwellings, 2011 The Italians in Croatia represent a residual minority of those indigenous Italian populations that inhabited for centuries and in large numbers, the coasts of Istria and the main cities of this and the coasts and islands of Dalmatia, which were territories of the Republic of Venice. After the conquest of Napoleon and his donation of the territories that belonged to the ancient Venetian Republic to the Habsburg Empire, these Italian populations had to undergo Austro-Hungarian power. After the First World War and the D'Annunzio enterprise of Fiume many of the Istrian and Dalmatian territories passed to the Kingdom of Italy, strengthening the Italian majority in Istria and Dalmatia. These populations were of Italian language and culture, speaking Venetian dialect and lived as a majority of the population in Istria and Dalmatia until the Second World War. After the Nazi-Fascist occupation of the Balkans, Slavic-speaking populations following the partisan commander Tito started a persecution of the Italian populations that had inhabited Istria and Dalmatia for several centuries. For fear of ethnic retaliation by the Slavic populations, the majority of Italians from Istria and Dalmatia poured into a real exodus towards Trieste and Triveneto. Subsequently many of them were transferred by the authorities of the Italian Republic to southern Lazio and Sardinia where they formed numerous local communities. 34,345 Italians live in Croatia since the census conducted in Croatia on 29 June 2014, through self- certification (Italian Union data): according to official data at the 2001 census, 20,521 declared themselves to be native Italian speakers2001 Census and 19,636 declared to be of Italian ethnicity2001 Census). The Italian Croats create 51 local Italian National Communities and are organized in the Italian Union (UI). According to Maurizio Tremul, president of the executive council of the UI, the census data in the part in which it is asked to declare the ethnicity are a bit distorted due to a \\"reverential fear\\" towards the censors who do not use Italian nor bilingual forms. The Croatian census in 2011 used a new methodology for the first time so that anyone who was not a resident of the territory or was not found at home was not surveyed. The Italians are mainly settled in the area of Istria, the islands of Kvarner and Rijeka. In coastal Dalmatia there are only 500 left, almost all of them in Zadar and Split. They are recognized by some municipal statutes as an indigenous population: in part of Istria (both in the Croatian Istrian region, in the four coastal municipalities of Slovenia), in parts of the region of Rijeka (Primorje-Gorski Kotar County) and in the Lo≈°inj archipelago, while in the rest of Kvarner and in Dalmatia no particular status is granted to them. In the city of Rijeka, where the largest Italian-language newspaper in Croatia is located, as well as some schools in Italian, officially there are about 2300 Italians, although the local Italian community in Rijeka has approximately 7500 members. The indigenous Venetian populations (north-western Istria and Dalmatia) and the Istriot-speaking peoples of the south-western Istrian coast are included in this Italian ethnic group. During the 19th century, a considerable number of Italian craftsmen moved to live in Zagreb and Slavonia (Po≈æega), where many of their descendants still live. A local Community of Italians was formed in Zagreb, which mainly brings together among its members recent immigrants from Italy, as well as a fair number of Italian-speaking Istrians who have moved to the capital. In Croatian Istria - between the towns of Valdarsa and Seiane - there is the small ethnic community of the Istroromeni or Cicci, a population originally from Romania whose language, of Latin and Romanian-like, is in danger of extinction in favor of the Croatian . During Fascism these Istrorumeni were considered ethnically Italian because of their mixing during the Middle Ages with the descendants of the Ladin populations of Roman Istria, and they were guaranteed elementary teaching in their native language.Another ethnic group originally of Romance language is that of the Morlacchi, a historical population deriving - according to the majority theories - from the ancient Latinized populations of the Dalmatian hinterland, subsequently Slavic. According to the 2001 census, the municipalities of Croatia with the highest percentage of Italian-speaking inhabitants were all in Istria (mainly in the areas of the former zone B of the Free Territory of Trieste): * Grisignana: 66.11% * Verteneglio: 41.29% * Buie: 39.66% * Portole: 32.11% * Valle d'Istria: 22.54% * Umago: 20.70% * Dignano: 20.03% Grisignana (in Croatian \\"Gro≈ænjan\\") is the only town with an absolute Italian-speaking majority in Croatia: over 2/3 of citizens still speak Italian and in the 2001 census over 53% declared themselves \\"native Italian\\" , while Gallesano (in Croatian \\"Gali≈æana\\") fraction of Dignano (in Croatian \\"Vodnjan\\") with 60% of the Italian population is the inhabited center of Istria with the highest percentage of Italians.  Croatisation  Istrian region of Croatia: distribution of native Italian speakers by municipality in the 2001 census. The Italian-Croatians have experienced a process of croatization over the past two centuries. This process was \\"overwhelming\\" especially in Dalmatia, where in 1865 the Austrian censuses recorded 55,020 Italian speakers, equal to 12.5% of the total, reduced in 1910 to 18,028 (2.8%)Tutti i dati in ≈†.Periƒçiƒá, O broju Talijana/talijana≈°a u Dalmaciji XIX. stoljeƒáa, in Radovi Zavoda za povijesne znanosti HAZU u Zadru, n. 45/2003, p. 342. In 2001 about 500 were counted, concentrated mainly in Zadar. The Italian-Croatians practically disappeared from the islands of central and southern Dalmatia during the rule of Titus, while at the time of the Risorgimento the Italians were still numerous in Lissa and other Dalmatian islands. Even in Dalmatian cities there was a similar decrease: in the city of Split in 1910 there were over 2,082 Italians (9.75% of the population), while today only a hundred remain around the local Community of Italians (Comunit√† degli Italiani) The last blow to the Italian presence in Dalmatia and in some areas of Kvarner and Istria took place in October 1953, when the Italian schools in Communist Yugoslavia were closed and the pupils moved imperiously to the Croatian schools. In Lagosta (in Croatian Lastovo), which belonged to the Kingdom of Italy from 1918 to 1947, there are still some Italian-Croatian families not fully Croatianized today. = Lagosta and Pelagosa (Lastovo and Palagru≈æa) = The island of Lagosta belonged to Italy from 1920 until the end of the Second World War. While up to 1910 the presence of Italian speakers on the island was laughable (8 in the territory of the municipality out of a total of 1,417 inhabitants), in the 1920s and 1930s several families of Italian Dalmatians moved from the areas of Dalmatia passed to the Yugoslavia. In the 1930s, about half of the inhabitants were Italian-speaking, but emigrated almost entirely after the end of the Second World War. Some Venetian or Italian-speaking families (although very Croatian) are still present on the island of Lesina, where the creation of an Italian Union headquarters - named after the Lesignano writer Giovanni Francesco Biondi - for all Italian- Croatians of Dalmatia has been promoted Southern. Pelagosa (and its small archipelago) was populated together with the nearby Tremiti islands by Ferdinando II of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1843 with fishermen from Ischia, who continued to speak the dialect of origin there. The attempt failed and the few fishermen emigrated in the late nineteenth century. During Fascism, the Italian authorities transplanted some fishermen from Tremiti, who left the island when it officially passed to Yugoslavia in 1947. The Pelagosa archipelago is uninhabited.  Education and Italian language  In many municipalities in the Istrian region (Croatia) there are bilingual statutes, and the Italian language is considered to be a co-official language. There are some Italian schools in Istria, especially in the territories of the former zone B: elementary schools in Buje, Umag, Novigrad, Porec, Pula and Rovinj; middle schools in Pula and Rovinj. In the city of Rijeka, the Italian school has kindergartens, elementary, middle and high schools. The proposal to raise Italian to a co-official language, as in the Istrian Region, has been under discussion for years. In Zadar, the local Community of Italians has requested the creation of an Italian asylum since 2009. After considerable government oppositionReazioni scandalizzate per il rifiuto governativo croato ad autorizzare un asilo italiano a ZaraZara: ok all'apertura dell'asilo italiano, with the imposition of a national filter that imposed the obligation to possess Italian citizenship for registration, in the end in 2013 it was opened hosting the first 25 childrenAperto ‚ÄúPinocchio‚Äù, primo asilo italiano nella citt√† di Zara. Since 2017, a Croatian primary school has been offering the study of the Italian language as a foreign language. Italian courses have also been activated in a secondary school and at the faculty of literature and philosophy. An Italian kindergarten was also opened in Mali Lo≈°inj in 2010.

Guide to aloes of South Africa. Briza Publications, Pretoria The name \\"pearsonii\\" remembers the botanist and first director of the South African National Botanical Institute, Professor Pearson. Appearance A plant in indoor cultivation, with fattened blue-green leaves that indicate recent watering. This aloe grows a clump of rigidly erect stems, that are covered in four highly symmetrical rows of thick re-curved leaves. In the dryer months the plants are red, while during times of rain the leaves fatten and turn blue-green. Pearson's aloe flowers in summer, and especially in January‚ÄìFebruary, producing a multi-branched inflorescence covered in bright red or yellow flowers. Of all the aloes, this species is the slowest growing. In spite of this, plants have been found in the wild with heights of over 2 meters. Such individuals are believed to be several hundred years old. Habitat This aloe occurs in groups in sandy patches of the rocky Richtersveld mountains. It is found in some of the hottest and driest parts of this area. Rain is very rare, and generally only during the winter months. It is possible that the plant receives some moisture from the mists that periodically sweep the mountainsides.

At that time Vedruccio suffered from a severe attack of gastritis, and as he was approaching a probe for the detection of high frequencies radio waves, he noticed a drop in the signal corresponding to 930-940 MHz.

It is an erect, slender, aromatic shrub with hairy, oblong leaves and small groups of pale bluish mauve to violet flowers. Description Prostanthera stenophylla is an erect, slender shrub that typically grows to a height of and has leaves that are covered with a dense mat of hairs and give off a strong aroma when crushed. The leaves are narrow egg-shaped to narrow elliptic but appear oblong due to the edge being curved downwards or rolled under. They are dull green above, paler below, long and wide on a very short petiole. The flowers are arranged in groups of four to six on short side shoots in leaf axils, with bracteoles long at the base of the sepals. The sepals are long forming a tube long with two lobes, the upper lobe long. The petals are pale bluish mauve to violet, long, the lower middle lobe long and wide, the lower lobes long and wide and the upper lobe about long and wide with a central notch deep. Flowering occurs in most months with a peak flowering in spring. Taxonomy Prostanthera stenophylla was first formally described by Barry Conn of the National Herbarium of New South Wales in the journal Telopea in 2006 from specimens collected near Dunns Swamp in 1996. He held it to be allied to the granite mintbush (Prostanthera granitica). The latter species is similar in appearance but has stiffer, rougher hairs and broader leaves. The first recorded collection of plant material from the type locality was by nurseryman George Althofer in 1952. A 1937 collection by Lindsay Pryor is recognised as this species, but the given locality of \\"Canberra district\\" is believed to be incorrect. The specific epithet (stenophylla) refers to the narrow leaves of this shrub species. Distribution and habitat This mintbush is only known from the Wollemi National Park where it is found in sclerophyll forest dominated by black cypress pine (Callitris endlicheri), snappy gum (Eucalyptus rossii) and Sydney peppermint (E. piperita), growing in sandstone outcrops that are colloquially known as 'pagodas'. Use in horticulture This species has been in limited cultivation for some years. The unofficial name of Prostanthera rylstonii has been used by plant nurseries since at least 2005.

Only a few compositions of Leopolita survive today. Four Latin motets (Cibavit eos, Mihi autem, Resurgente Christo and Spiritus Domini) are preserved only in organ tablature, and of these only Cibavit Eos can be restored with confidence to its original vocal form. All four of these works are known from a single source: a tablature formerly belonging to the Warsaw Musicological Society which now only survives as a photographic copy, the original having been destroyed during World War Two. This tablature was probably written around 1580 and has been known as the Tablature of Martin Leopolita, although while Leopolita himself was indeed an organist his connection with the manuscript is uncertain. Leopolita's five-part mass Missa paschalis is the only sixteenth- century Polish mass to survive intact, and the Agnus Dei, which adds a sixth voice (a second Cantus) has the distinction of being the earliest extant example of six-part Polish polyphony. It is based on themes from four Polish vernacular Easter songs (hence the designation 'Paschalis') of which Chrystus Pan zmartwychwsta≈Ç is the most prominent.

The 'Stanley's in a Trance Mix' rapidly became popular on the UK and European club scene and national radio circuit during late 2000 to early 2001, but as a consequence of being unable to acquire legal clearance for the use of Dido's vocal segment, the track ultimately was not able to get an official release. In spring 2001, the track was re-released under AM PM Records as \\"Stanley - Here I Am\\" with the Dido sample having been removed and replaced with an entirely new vocal segment (Caroline De Batselier), modifying the feel of the track quite profoundly. In April 2001, the official (modified) version reached a peak position of No. 36 on the UK Singles Chart and is currently listed in the Top 100 trance anthems of all time.

It was first described from moths found in Surrey, England by the entomologist John Douglas in 1846. Life cycle Adults are on wing from September to May, overwintering as an adult. The forewings are buff and the wingspan is 14‚Äì17 mm. =Eggs= In Great Britain and Ireland, eggs are laid on the leaves of wild carrot (Daucus carota) during May. Elsewhere in Europe eggs are also laid on Laserpitium gallicum and Distichoselinum tenuifolium. =Larva= Larva can be found from June to August. Initially they mine the leaves of their host plant in the form of a small, irregular full depth corridor. Older larvae vacate their mines and continue feeding in a folded leaf, sewn with white silk. The silk can often be seen at the edge of the habitation. Early instars are a dull yellowish green with a black head. On the later instars the body is apple green with dark greyish green lines and a black head. ;Similar species The intermediate and later instars of A. ciliella feed on a variety of umbelliferous plants; larvae of this species and A. rotundella should be reared to confirm the identification. =Pupa= Found in the soil or amongst detritus. Distribution The moth is found in most of Europe, except Fennoscandia and most of the Balkan Peninsula. In Britain, although the type species was found inland it is now confined to coasts. Also found in Iran and Turkey.

Originally a Torabi solo project, it became a full band in summer 2009. Knifeworld has connections with various English musical projects both inside and outside the rock world, having shared members with Cardiacs, Chrome Hoof, North Sea Radio Orchestra and Sidi Bou Said (London-based oud player Khyam Allami also served as the band's original drummer). History Born in Tehran before moving to England while still a baby, Torabi had previously played with a succession of bands. Beginning his career in Die Laughing and Squid Squad in Plymouth, he moved to London and came to public attention as one of the two singing guitarists in The Monsoon Bassoon. Playing what Torabi described as \\"lysergic funk\\" and various reviewers described as psychedelia and math rock, The Monsoon Bassoon scored three Singles of the Week in a row in New Musical Express in 1997 and 1998 and released a single album, I Dig Your Voodoo before splitting up in 2001. During this time Torabi had become a well-established member of the group of musicians focused around Cardiacs, whom he joined as guitarist in 2003, playing with them until the group's enforced halt in 2008. Torabi had formulated the ideas for Knifeworld as a solo project at around the time of the breakup of the Monsoon Bassoon, but took eight years to assemble, finalise and record the songs. For the band's first recordings, he played the bulk of the instruments himself (guitars, bass guitar, keyboards, santoor, melodica, violins and \\"devices\\") as well as singing the majority of the lead vocals and writing, producing and arranging all of the material. Former Sidi Bou Said drummer Melanie Woods sang the rest of the lead vocals and also sang backing vocals. The recording sessions featured further contributions from a broad swathe of musical collaborators drawn from Torabi's contacts on the London art-rock scene. Drums were played by Khyam Allami (ex-Ursa and Art of Burning Water). James Larcombe (Stars in Battledress/North Sea Radio Orchestra) played piano and Ben Jacobs (a.k.a. Max Tundra) played keyboards and trumpet. Katherine Blake (Medi√¶val B√¶bes) played recorder and Crawford Blair (Geiger Counter/Foe/The Slow Life) contributed some bass guitar parts. Torabi's former Monsoon Bassoon bandmate Sarah Measures contributed saxophone, clarinet and flute, and further vocals were provided by Shona Davidson and former Ring singer Johnny Karma. The debut Knifeworld album, 'Buried Alone - Tales of Crushing Defeat', was released on Torabi's own Believer's Roast label (via Genepool distribution) on 17 August 2009. It was preceded by the download single 'Pissed Up On Brake Fluid' on 13 July 2009. In summer 2009 Torabi set up a live Knifeworld band, led by himself as singer and guitarist, with Woods remaining as second vocalist and Allami as drummer. Three new members were added: bass guitarist Craig Fortnam (better known as the leader of North Sea Radio Orchestra) and two members of the avant-garde rock orchestra Chrome Hoof (keyboard player Emmett Elvin and bassoonist/saxophonist/backing singer Chloe Herington). The live band made their debut at 93 Feet East, Spitalfields, London on 18 August 2009. Soon afterwards, Torabi would formally establish this live lineup as the full Knifeworld lineup, transforming it from a solo project to a full band. In winter 2010, Knifeworld began to make new recordings. In December, the first full band recording emerged: a cover version of the Cardiacs song 'The Stench of Honey' appeared on Leader of the Starry Skies: A Tribute to Tim Smith, Songbook 1 (a fundraising compilation album to benefit the hospitalised Cardiacs leader Tim Smith). In July 2011, Knifeworld released the 'Dear Lord, No Deal' EP, another full band recording. During the winter of 2011, Knifeworld changed its lineup again when both Allami and Fortnam departed amicably to concentrate on their own projects. Torabi recruited former Veils drummer Ben Woollacott, and Charlie Cawood (a multi-instrumentalist who also plays or has played with Tonochrome, Spiritwo and a host of bands in various disciplines) joined as the new bass guitarist. The new lineup recorded the 'Clairvoyant Fortnight' EP, released in the summer of 2012 (and accompanied by a striking video shot by Thumpermonkey's Michael Woodman, set in an Edwardian seance and featuring a guest appearance by snooker star (and progressive rock advocate) Steve Davis. This period also saw an expansion of the band's lineup, the addition of saxophonists Josh Perl and Nicki Maher making Knifeworld an octet. In the early autumn of 2012, Knifeworld teamed up with two other bands with similar aims (London's The Fierce and the Dead, and Salford's Trojan Horse) for a series of British gigs called the Stabbing a Dead Horse Tour. The band would play further assorted gigs in the UK during 2013, and in September 2013 released their first new material for over a year - the download-only single \\"Don't Land On Me\\", which featured a guest appearance by former Do Me Bad Things singer Chantal Brown and a performance video filmed by The Chaos Engineers. Having signed to Inside Out Music in early 2014, Knifeworld released their second album, 'The Unravelling', in July of that year. A video for 'Destroy The World We Love' preceded the record's release, also made with The Chaos Engineers. Around this time, Nicki Maher stepped down from the band, and was replaced by Oliver Sellwood (the saxophonist for A Sweet Niche and Workers Union Ensemble). That autumn, Knifeworld made its first proper trip to Europe as main tour support to Amplifier. In 2016, Knifeworld released their third album Bottled Out Of Eden.

The monastic buildings then came into use as a mint, which after its decommissioning became known as the Old Mint, giving rise to the present day street name Gammel M√∏nt at the site.  History  The Poor Clares first arrived in Denmark in 1249. An important monastery was established at Roskilde, the capital of Denmark at the time. In 1497 King John I and Queen Christina founded the monastery in Copenhagen with a gift of the former royal vegetable gardens, located in the north part of the city near the city wall, in an area known as Roseng√•rd after an earlier estate. In 1498 the Queen made a donation of 40 Rhenish Guilders for construction of the monastery. It was completed and consecrated on 11 August 1505, the Feast day of St. Clare, with great ceremony. The monastery consisted of a dormitory, refectory, church, infirmary, cellars and places for lay sisters and a priest to stay.  Dissolution  The monastery prospered in the early years, but as the Protestant Reformation gained influence, the daily search for food and alms for the poor began to dry up. Many Danes felt that the mendicant orders, nicknamed the 'beggar monks and nuns' were an additional burden over and above the regular tithes and fees paid to sustain the church. In 1527 a priest formerly assigned to the monastery wrote to King Christian II, describing a chest which the abbess of the monastery had given him to distribute to the Poor Clares in Odense, who were suffering dire poverty. The abbess had asked him to convey the money in secret because she was afraid if the amount became known the Order would be held up to scorn and ridicule. He encouraged Christian II to return to Denmark to take in hand the care of the Poor Clares who had been his mother's 'particular and elect' daughters. The city fathers passed a law that forbade the nuns or their agents from collecting food or alms on the street which quickly impoverished the monastery. By January 1532 conditions had grown so bad that the 'nursing sisters' and the 'provisioner sisters' had abandoned the monastery. The Franciscan friars had been expelled from their friary, leaving the nuns with virtually no way to sustain themselves spiritually or temporally. A few of the friars were permitted to gather alms for the Poor Clares, but they could not solicit alms any closer than 40 miles from the city. The transport of large quantities of food back to Copenhagen proved to be so difficult that they attempted to sell the provisions for money. The Grayfriars were by that time generally hated, and few would purchase anything from them. On 25 May 1535 the Minister General of the Franciscan Order wrote to the abbess, informing her that either they would have to abandon the monastery, or they would have to violate their Rule and accept cash money for their sustenance. Denmark officially became Lutheran in October 1536 with the adoption of the Smalcald Articles. All Catholic church property and buildings became Crown property. The monastery was closed and the nuns either went to other locations or left the Order. Much of the monastery was converted into shops and residences for the poor. The largest building began to be used as the Royal Mint in 1541. Several city fires, the worst in 1728, destroyed the complex and no remnants exist of the monastery today.

Whilst farmers attributed 1.3% of mortalities as due to vent pecking the most common findings at autopsy were different types of cannibalism (65.51%), with vent cannibalism (38.57%) the most common.Weitzenburger, D., Vits, A., Hamann, H. and Distl, O., (2005).

Risk factors that have been identified as increasing vent pecking include dim lights placed in nest boxes to encourage hens to use the boxes, the diet being changed more than three times during the egg laying period, the use of bell drinkers, and the hens beginning to lay earlier than 20 weeks of age. Vent pecking is associated with indicators of stress, e.g. fluctuating asymmetry, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and tonic immobility duration.Campo, J.L., Prieto, M.T. and D√°vila, S.G., (2008).

It was erected by the German-American organizations of Syracuse and Onondaga County, and was unveiled on October 15, 1911. Schiller, who is on the reader's right in the photograph, was called the \\"poet of freedom\\" in the US, and he had an enormous 19th Century following. The Syracuse monument was the last of 13 monuments to Schiller that were erected in US cities. Goethe was the \\"supreme genius of modern German literature\\"; he and Schiller are paired in the statue because they had a friendship \\"like no other known to literature or art.\\" As Paul Zanker writes, in the statue a \\"fatherly Goethe gently lays his hand on the shoulder of the restless Schiller, as if to quiet the overzealous passion for freedom of the younger generation.\\" Goethe is holding a laurel wreath in his right hand, and Schiller's right hand is reaching towards it. The Goethe‚ÄìSchiller Monument in Syracuse was modeled on the 1857 monument in Weimar, Germany. Ernst Rietschel had been commissioned to create a cast bronze double-statue for Weimar, which was exactly copied for the Syracuse and for three earlier US monuments. The Syracuse monument is in Schiller Park, which had been renamed in 1905, the centennial of Schiller's death. Paid online access. The statue tops a large black marble pedestal; it is at the top of a steep slope, and is approached by a formal stairway (see postcard and photo). The US monuments were costly and took years of fundraising and effort to erect. Their dedications drew large crowds. The 1907 dedication of the Goethe‚ÄìSchiller monument in Cleveland, Ohio drew 65,000 attendees. For the dedication in Syracuse, The Syracuse Herald reported that: Online version posted by Michelle Stone. 19th century context alt=Photograph of an old color postcard. There is printing at the top left of the postcard that says \\"Goethe and Schiller Monument, Syracuse, N.Y.\\" The picture shows a statue of two men on a stone pedestal. The statue is at the top of a slope, and is approached by a long, wide stairway. There are several lighting fixtures on each side of the stairway, and there are formal plantings of shrubbery on both sides. There are trees behind the statue. As Paul Zanker describes it, the original Weimar monument helped launch a \\"veritable cult\\" of zeal for the poets and of monument building. The monument was very unusual for its time. It was rare until the 1850s to erect costly monuments to poets and intellectuals. Double monuments were also unusual, as was the choice to depict the poets in contemporary dress. The resulting monument was considered highly successful, and set a style for the numerous monuments to the poets that followed. By 1859, the centenary of Schiller's birth and the occasion for 440 celebrations in German lands, Schiller in particular had emerged as the \\"poet of freedom and unity\\" for German citizens. R√ºdiger G√∂rner has illustrated the origins of Schiller's reputation with a speech from the \\"famous\\" tenth scene of the third act of Schiller's 1787 play, Don Carlos: \\"Look all around at nature's mastery, / Founded on freedom. And how rich it grows, / Feeding on freedom.\\" Ute Frevert has written of the celebrations, \\"It did not matter who spoke, a Hamburg plumber, a political emigrant in Paris, an aristocratic civil servant in M√ºnster, a writer in Wollenb√ºttel, they unanimously invoked Schiller as a singer of freedom and the prophet of German unity.\\" About four dozen monuments to Schiller or Goethe were erected in German-speaking Europe between 1850 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914. In the same era, four million German-speakers emigrated to the United States. Schiller continued to have great significance to these immigrants; his work \\"was the best expression of that side of German character which most qualified the German despite his distinctiveness to become a true American citizen\\". By the late 1800s, the German-Americans had also become prodigious monument builders, and they erected at least fifteen additional monuments to the poets prior to World War I. In 1900, the total population of Syracuse and Onondaga County was 168,000. Nearly 10,000 had been born in German-speaking countries of Europe; with their children, it was estimated at the time that there were more than 25,000 German-speakers. Online version posted by Michelle Stone. There were extensive observances in May, 1905 of the centennial of Schiller's death. Posted by Michelle Stone. Round Top Park was renamed Schiller Park on July 3, 1905, and planning commenced for the Goethe‚ÄìSchiller Monument. The monument they erected was costly. In Syracuse, the 1908 Deutscher Tag (German Day) celebration was raising funds for the monument, Posted by Michelle Stone. as did the subsequent 1909 and 1910 German Days. The 1908 Goethe‚ÄìSchiller Monument in Milwaukee cost $15,000 to erect, and presumably the cost for the Syracuse monument three years later was about the same. For comparison, the cost of building the sizable 1901 Deutsche Evangelische Friedenskirche (German Evangelist Peace Church) in Syracuse was also about $15,000. Ultimately, about 60 monuments to Schiller and to Goethe were built in German-speaking Europe and the United States. The 1911 Syracuse monument was one of the last in the style that had been largely established by the Weimar original 54 years earlier. Christiane Hertel has suggested that the lavishness of the late monuments and their celebrations in the US were \\"a German-American farewell to the Schiller cult, at least in this form and with this popular, inclusive scope.\\" While the Weimar monument is still \\"one of the most famous and most beloved monuments in all of Germany\\", the original significance of the US monuments is now largely forgotten. Fabrication and restoration of the monument alt=Photograph showing a long, broad flight of steps leading to a large metal statue of two men. There are about 50 steps. The two men in the statue are roughly life-sized, and are standing on a large stone pedestal. The pedestal has bronze plaque that reads \\"Goethe und Schiller\\". The first three Goethe‚ÄìSchiller monuments in the US were in San Francisco (1901), Cleveland (1907), and Milwaukee (1908). They all incorporated bronze sculptures cast at the foundry in Lauchhammer, Germany; the original sculpture in Weimar is also a bronze casting. The statue in Syracuse is not a casting; it consists of thin copper pieces that are joined together. The statue has a small plaque attached to its base that reads \\"Galvanoplastik-Geislingen St.\\", which indicates that it was made by the Abteilung f√ºr Galvanoplastik (Galvanoplastic Division) of the WMF Company in Geislingen an der Steige, Germany. Galvanoplastik is a German word encompassing both electrotyping and electroforming. The pieces were fabricated using the electrotyping process, which involves the depositing of copper metal from a solution of chemicals onto the inside of a mold. The process is activated by electrical currents flowing between wires immersed in the solution and a coating on the mold; the coating and the solution both conduct electricity. As in the Syracuse statue, large electrotyped sculptures typically consist of electrotyped copper pieces that are joined together, most likely by soldering. The individual pieces in electrotyped sculptures are a fraction of an inch thick, and one surface conforms very exactly to the details of the mold. The Syracuse sculpture is apparently the only copy of Rietschel's statue that was produced using copper electrotyping, and may be the only public artwork in the United States that was produced by WMF. As can be seen by comparing the 1913 postcard and the contemporary photograph, at some point the decorative electrical lighting fixtures on the staircase leading to the monument were removed. By 2001 the condition of the monument had become very poor due both to weathering and to vandalism. The German- American Society of Central New York undertook a project to restore the monument, in cooperation with the city government of Syracuse. In 2003, the statue was restored by Sharon BuMann, who described the construction of the statue in an interview the same year. At the same time the masonry pedestal for the statue was cleaned, the stairway leading to the statue was repaired, and decorative iron fencing was installed around the statue and pedestal.

It is endemic to the island of Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats in Kerala, South Western India. It was considered a subspecies of the Oriental bay owl (Phodilus badius) but is now treated as a full species due to its distinctive call, plumage and disjunct distribution. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland. It is threatened by habitat loss.  Taxonomy  The Sri Lanka bay owl was described by the English politician and naturalist Allan Octavian Hume in 1873 but it was only in 1877 that he introduced the binomial name Phodilus assimilis. The genus name Phodilus is from the Ancient Greek ph≈çs for \\"light\\" or \\"daylight\\" and deilos for \\"timid\\" or \\"cowardly\\". The specific epithet assimilis is the Latin for \\"similar\\" or \\"like\\". It was earlier considered a subspecies of the Oriental bay owl Phodilus badius, but now treated as a separate species based on differences in call and plumage.

Raymond is the current head coach of the Hungarian club SAPA Feh√©rv√°r AV19 in the Austrian Hockey League. Prior to joining SAPA Feh√©rv√°r AV19 during the 2013 off season, he spent two seasons coaching KHL Medve≈°ƒçak, another EBEL club. Raymond was the long-time coach of the ECHL's Bakersfield Condors. Lawsuit In January 2011, Raymond was named in the lawsuit filed by Jason Bailey in which Bailey alleges that he was \\"forced to endure a barrage of anti-Semitic, offensive and degrading verbal attacks regarding his Jewish faith,\\" from Bakersfield Condors head coach Marty Raymond and \\"suffered severe and/or pervasive harassment,\\" from assistant coach Mark Pederson.Player suing Anaheim Ducks for anti-Semitic abuse in ECHL On January 27, ESPN.com released details of the filed court documents and reported that the NHL is also now investigating. A court case initiated by former Bakersfield Condor player Jason Bailey against the team, and former coaches Marty Raymond and Mark Pederson, is in the process of being dismissed. Documents filed with the Superior Court of Kern County on Nov. 4 indicated that counsel for Bailey voluntarily filed a request to have the Court dismiss all claims of religious discrimination against the team. The Condors, owner Jonathan Fleisig, as well as the individual coaches, maintained that the claims of Bailey were patently false and unfounded. The pending dismissal comes without a settlement of any kind for Bailey, the Condors said. Bailey was assigned to the Condors by the Anaheim Ducks in the 2008-09 season and played in 35 games. \\"In even the most unmeritorious cases, plaintiffs can receive nuisance value settlements paid by defendants who simply want to avoid the costs of litigation, but in this case, Bailey dismissed his claims without receiving a single thing in return,\\" Bryan Freedman, counsel for the Condors, said in statement. \\"Bailey's willingness to dismiss the case in the absence of receiving any settlement certainly evidences the frivolity of his claims.\\" Bailey filed the suit in Orange County Superior Court in January, accusing Raymond and Pederson of anti-Semitism. It was transferred to Kern County Superior Court, with a different attorney, in July. \\"We feel vindicated after this ridiculous ordeal,\\" Condors owner Jonathan Fleisig said in a statement. \\"To have our team name and the city of Bakersfield dragged through the mud by these claims is reprehensible. We have always considered ourselves an upstanding organization in this community and a proud representative of Bakersfield and Kern County.\\" Raymond left the team in June to take a coaching position in Europe. Pederson has not been with the Condors the past three seasons and is coaching in Japan. The Condors are investigating whether to file a malicious prosecution claim against Bailey and his counsel.

Both the district and the selo were renamed in March 1941 to commemorate Bolshevik revolutionary Ivan Babushkin, who was born in Ledengskoye. History In the 14th century, salt was discovered in the valley of the Ledenga, and the selo of Ledengskoye was historically known for salt production. In the 19th century, Ledengskoye belonged to Totemsky Uyezd of Vologda Governorate. On July 15, 1929 Ledengsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Ledengskoye was established as part of Vologda Okrug of Northern Krai. From 1841, the salt water of Ledengskoye was used for medical purposes. In 1989, the Ledengsk Spa Resort was open. The resort uses underground lakes with high concentration of salt. Economy The salt production was traditionally the main occupation of the population of Ledengskoye, but it is extinct. The economy of babushkinsky District is based on timber production. =Transportation= A paved road connecting Totma with Nikolsk passes through Imeni Babushkina. Before the road between Totma and Veliky Ustyug along the Sukhona was completed in the 2000s, this was the only road connecting Vologda and Totma to Veliky Ustyug. There is regular bus traffic. Culture and recreation Imeni Babushkina contains one object (a monument to Ivan Babushkin) classified as cultural heritage of the federal significance and eight objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. These are the buildings of Ledengskoye Salt Production Factory, the church ensemble, and the house where Ivan Babushkin was born. The Memorial Museum of Ivan Babushkin is located in Imeni Babushkina.

The UK Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) came into effect in 2005, and FOI requests were made to the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) for the raw data from weather stations used in developing instrumental temperature record datasets, for copies of agreements under which the raw data was obtained from meteorology institutions, and also for email correspondence relating to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report. In many cases the raw data which CRU had obtained from National Meteorological Organisations was subject to restrictions on redistribution: on 12 August 2009 CRU announced that they were seeking permission to waive these restrictions, and on 24 November 2009 the university stated that over 95% of the CRU climate data set had already been available for several years, with the remainder to be released when permissions were obtained. In a decision announced on 27 July 2011 the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) required release of raw data even though permissions had not been obtained or in one instance had been refused, and on 27 July 2011 CRU announced release of the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request. A 2008 FOI request by David Holland for emails discussing work on the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report was refused by the university. In November 2009 he alleged that CRU emails posted online discussed deleting the emails he had requested: in January 2010 the Deputy Information Commissioner told a journalist that this indicated an offence under section 77 of the FOIA, but prosecution was time-barred by statute of limitations. Newspapers misrepresented this as a decision in relation to raw data, and the issue was discussed by the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry, which found there had been a lack of openness. The ICO decision published on 7 July 2010 stated that this potential offence had not been investigated as it was time-barred. As Holland was content not to proceed with his complaint against the university, no further action was needed, but the ICO would \\"consider whether further action is appropriate to secure future compliance.\\" In September 2011 the ICO issued new guidance to universities. This described exceptions and exemptions to protect research, including allowance for internal exchange of views between academics and researchers free from external scrutiny, as well as commending actively disclosing information when it is in the public interest. FOIA requests for raw climate data From 1978 onwards, the Climatic Research Unit developed its gridded CRUTEM data set of land air temperature anomalies back to 1850, based on instrumental temperature records held by National Meteorological Organisations around the world, often under formal or informal confidentiality agreements that restricted use of this raw data to academic purposes. Beginning in 1991, Phil Jones of CRU discussed data with Warwick Hughes (later of the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition). From 2002 onwards, Jones received requests from Stephen McIntyre for instrumental raw data (McIntyre became prominent in contrarian disputes over the methodology of paleoclimate hockey stick graphs shown in the IPCC Third Assessment Report of 2001). Jones says that at first he tried to meet McIntyre's requests, but he soon became inundated with requests that he could not fulfill due to time or confidentiality constraints, and began refusing requests. The new UK Freedom of Information Act came into effect in 2005, and in February of that year Jones discussed with fellow climate researchers the potential implications of the Act for McIntyre's requests. In 2007 he told colleagues that, having seen what McIntyre's Climate Audit blog was doing, UEA had been turning down FOIA requests associated with the blog. The scientists concerned saw such requests as disrupting the time available for their work, and those making them as nitpicking to suit an agenda rather than trying to advance scientific knowledge. Late in 2008, the university's FOI managers took advice from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on exceptions allowing refusal of requests. McIntyre complained that data denied to him had been sent to Peter Webster at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who was working on a joint publication with Jones, and between 24 and 29 July 2009 the university received 58 FOI requests for raw data or details of the confidentiality agreements from McIntyre and his readers at the Climate Audit blog. * On 24 July Jonathan A. Jones of the University of Oxford made a FOIA request for the data that Jones had sent to Webster, the UEA refused this request on 14 August. Don Keiller of Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge then made a similar FOIA request, UEA refused this on 11 September 2009.letter to Jonathan Jones, and FOI request made 24 July 2009, refused by UEA 14 August 2009. FOI request made 14 August 2009, refused by UEA 11 September 2009. On 12 August 2009, Nature News published a statement by Phil Jones that he was working to release the raw data in a systematic way, and was writing to all the National Meteorological Organisations requesting their agreement to waive confidentiality. In mid October CRU issued a statement on data availability, describing how National Metereological Services (NMSs) and scientists had given or sold them data with written or verbal agreements that it must only used for academic purposes, and not passed onto third parties. There were difficulties in separating out raw data, some of which was subject to charges made by NMSs, and \\"These data are not ours to provide without the full permission of the relevant NMSs, organizations and scientists.\\" They hoped to obtain consents and to publish all the data jointly with the Met Office. On 24 November 2009, four days after the start of the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, the university stated that over 95% of the CRU climate data set had already been available for several years, and the remainder would be released when permissions were given. The university worked closely with the Met Office, which sent requests to National Meteorological Organisations for agreement to waive confidentiality on raw instrumental data, as CRU had announced on 12 August 2009. Some gave full or conditional agreement, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by Trinidad and Tobago and Poland. In discussions with the ICO about the FOIA requests which Jonathan Jones and Don Keiller had made before the email controversy had begun, the university argued that the data was publicly available from the Met organisations, and the lack of agreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available and there was insufficient evidence that disclosure would have an adverse effect on international relations. The ICO required the university to release the data covered by the FOIA request within 35 calendar days. On 27 July 2011 CRU announced release of the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request. The data are available for download from Met Office website and from CRU. The university remained concerned \\"that the forced release of material from a source which has explicitly refused to give permission for release could have some damaging consequences for the UK in international research collaborations.\\" FOIA requests for emails discussing IPCC Fourth Assessment Report In May 2008 David Holland, an electrical engineer from Northampton, made a FOI request for all emails to and from Keith Briffa about the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4); formal review exchanges had already been published. The University of East Anglia (UEA) information policy and compliance manager (IPCM) refused the request. Holland appealed to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) about the UEA's refusals of FOI requests he had made for emails to and from Briffa about the IPCC AR4 report. On 23 November 2009, after the start of the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, he wrote to the Commissioner explaining in detail the relevance of the alleged CRU emails to his case. In one of these sent in May 2008, Jones asked others to delete emails discussing AR4 with Briffa. ICO decisions are enforced under Section 50 by notices defining steps to be taken by the public authority within defined time limits, and failure to comply can be taken to court. In addition, Section 77 makes it an offence to intentionally destroy or conceal information which has been requested., 52: Enforcement notices, Part VIII Miscellaneous and supplemental, Section 77. Offence of altering etc. records with intent to prevent disclosure. In response to a Sunday Times journalist who persistently asked why the ICO was not prosecuting under Section 77, Deputy Information Commissioner Graham Smith replied on 22 January 2010 that \\"The FOI Act makes it an offence for public authorities to act so as to prevent intentionally the disclosure of requested information. Mr Holland's FOI requests were submitted in 2007/8, but it has only recently come to light that they were not dealt with in accordance with the Act. The legislation requires action within six months of the offence taking place, so by the time the action came to light the opportunity to consider a prosecution was long gone.\\" The ICO was looking into other investigations time-barred by statute of limitations restrictions to see if a case could be made to change the relevant law. The journalist's report as published in The Times on 28 January portrayed this as an ICO decision that the university \\"broke the law by refusing to hand over its raw data for public scrutiny\\" but the ICO \\"could not prosecute those involved because the complaint was made too late.\\" The university promptly wrote to the ICO objecting to the damaging statement having been made to a journalist without first consulting the university. It described the misrepresentation by the press and requested retraction or clarification of the alleged breaches. The ICO declined to retract, but clarified that its investigation under Section 50 had not been completed and no decision notice had been issued. It said that \\"The fact that the elements of a section 77 offence may have been found here, but cannot be acted on because of the elapsed time, is a very serious matter. The ICO is not resiling from its position on this\\", and that \\"Errors like this are frequently made in press reports and the ICO cannot be expected to correct them, particularly when the ICO has not itself referred to penalties or sanctions in its own statement.\\" In its submission to the Science and Technology Select Committee, the university denied allegations that it had refused to release raw data in breach of the FOI Act, and said that the Deputy Information Commissioner's comments had been incorrectly reported as referring to such data. In its inquiry report, the Science and Technology Select Committee criticised the ICO, which it said had made \\"a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate\\", and recommended that it should develop procedures to check its public comments, and \\"swiftly correct any mis- statements or misinterpretations of such statements\\". While there was prima facie evidence of a breach of Section 77 of the FOI Act, it would \\"be premature, without a thorough investigation affording each party the opportunity to make representations, to conclude that UEA was in breach of the Act.\\" It called for a full investigation by the Muir Russell inquiry or by the Information Commissioner to resolve this issue, and accepted that the six month statute of limitations restriction was insufficient and should be reviewed. On the general issue of information requests, the committee said that information not covered by the exclusions provided by the FOIA should have been disclosed, and \\"in future information, including data and methodology, should be published proactively on the internet wherever possible.\\" It blamed the university for mishandling Freedom of Information requests, and said it had ‚Äúfound ways to support the culture at CRU of resisting disclosure of information to climate change sceptics‚Äù. The ICO decision on Holland's requests published on 7 July 2010 concluded that the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) applied rather than the equivalent FOIA, and the university had failed to provide responses within the correct time, but as Holland was content not to proceed with his complaint, no further action was needed. Regarding the question of whether there had been a breach of section 77 of the FOIA or its equivalent in the EIR, the ICO stated \\"Although the emails referred to above indicated prime facie evidence of an offence, the Commissioner was unable to investigate because six months had passed since the potential offence was committed, a constraint placed on the legislation by the Magistrates Court Act 1980.\\" On the more general issue of emails suggesting that attempts to circumvent the legislation had been considered, and a lack of openness, the ICO would \\"now consider whether further action is appropriate to secure future compliance.\\" In an opinion piece, Edward Acton, Vice-Chancellor of the UEA, commended legislation in the US where \\"the FOI distinguishes between recorded factual material necessary to validate research findings, which must be disclosed, and ‚Äòpreliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews [and] communications with colleagues‚Äô, which are exempted.\\" New freedom of information guidance to universities In September 2011 the ICO issued new guidance to universities, taking into account issues raised in relation to the CRU information requests. This describes exceptions and exemptions to protect research, including allowance for internal exchange of views between academics and researchers, leaving formulation of opinions on research free from external scrutiny.

Early and personal life Rose is one of five children raised by Waldorf schoolteachers in Garden City, Long Island. He attended the Waldorf School of Garden City from K-12 and pursued study of piano in New York at the Manhattan School of Music prior to college. He enrolled at Princeton University as a scholarship student and physics major but soon switched to architecture. He has lived in Boston since attending the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. Works Rose earned degrees in architecture at Princeton University and Harvard's Graduate School of Design, studying under Michael Graves and Rafael Moneo. After Harvard, Rose worked with landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh, an experience that influenced his design philosophy of architecture that \\"sees the site.\\" He established his practice in Boston in 1989 and in two decades completed more than 50 buildings. His architecture, influenced by his work with Valkenburgh, is formally conscious of site and the buildings relationship to it. Two early projects that established Rose's reputation for buildings that \\"see the site\\" are the Leeper Studio Complex at the Atlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. (1997), and Camp Paint Rock (2000) in Hyattville, Wyo. The Atlantic Center for the Arts is in the rainforest-like environment of Florida's East Coast and uses boardwalks to connect the buildings with meandering paths. Camp Paint Rock on the other hand, uses elevated paths to connect the buildings along the canyon of northern Wyoming. Rose's buildings in both settings have been described as being knit into the landscape (rather than objects on the land). The forms he creates \\"resonate with features of the site and mediate the site's demands\\", such as climate and orientation toward the sun. After completing Camp Paint Rock, for underprivileged Los Angeles teens, Rose received several commissions: including a commercial project in 1997 for Gemini Consulting to design an \\"office of the future\\" which was noted by an award from Architectural Record; Gulf Coast Museum of Art (Largo, Fl., 2001); the United States Port of Entry in Del Rio, Texas, and the Currier Center for the Performing Arts at The Putney School (Putney, Vt., 2004). Buildings for academic, cultural and non-profit institutions are the mainstays of Rose's practice, along with private homes that have been described as warm, modernist spaces that are \\"sculptural and lyrical.\\" Orleans House and the New York penthouse Rose completed in 2010 for violinist Joshua Bell are two examples. Rose also completed several large-scale institutional projects in 2010: the Carl and Ruth Shapiro Admissions Center at Brandeis University in Waltham, Ma. (a second project for Brandeis, after the 65,000 square foot Carl and Ruth Shapiro Campus Center, which opened in 2002) and the Jean Vollum Drawing, Painting, and Photography Building at Oregon College of Art and Craft in Portland. The firm has worked in energy-efficient design with two significant federal and state commissions: a zero-net-energy consumption transit center for the state of Massachusetts and a 60,000-square-foot office building in Portsmouth, NH. This project was commissioned by the U.S. General Services Administration's \\"Design Excellence Program\\". Leeper Studio Complex Bartholomew County Veterans Memorial Rose has also taught in the architecture programs at many universities, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Virginia, and Harvard and Rice universities. Rose also designs furniture; his Executive Mother and Child Desk was featured in Dwell magazine in 2006 =Carbon-Neutral or Zero Net Energy Consumption Design= Rose's designs incorporate energy-efficient features, such as geothermal, planted roofs, and louver systems that increase natural lighting. Its most energy-efficient building ‚Äì a brick-and-copper-clad 25,000-square- foot transit center in Greenfield, Ma. ‚Äì is designed to produce as much energy as it uses by drawing on geothermal sources, a wood-chip boiler and photovoltaic array. The project, funded in part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is the state's first zero-net-energy transit center and will serve as an office, bus station, and train depot on the upgraded \\"Knowledge Corridor\\" rail line that goes from Connecticut through Massachusetts to Vermont.Schaeffer, Julie. \\"Challenging Modern Aesthetic Trends.\\" Green Building & Design, October (2010): 44-46.

It was launched on December 24, 2009, by Rogan and comedian Brian Redban, who is also producer and co-host, later in 2013 Jamie Vernon took Brian Redban spot as the co-host and producer. By 2015, it was one of the world's most popular podcasts, regularly receiving millions of views per episode, and includes a wide array of guests.  History  =Origins and launch= The podcast originates to around 2003 when Rogan hired Brian Redban, a self-taught video editor and an employee at a Gateway 2000 computer store in Ohio, to work for him full time to film, produce, and edit videos for his website. Rogan had noticed video work that Redban did for comedian Doug Stanhope and invited him to film him and his group on stand-up comedy tours. Redban accepted and relocated to California in the process, following Rogan with a camera and \\"recording everything\\". After several years, Redban noticed that fans were demanding more content from Rogan and for it to be delivered faster. This prompted the two to seek new ways of quickening what was a lengthy editing process to make their website and content more interactive. Coupled with his interest in popular live video streaming services of the time, Redban wanted \\"to do the same thing I was filming, but live\\", and set up live streams on Justin.tv from the green room at Rogan's comedy gigs. Redban had no prior experience with audio engineering, so he taught himself how to operate the mixing board and microphone setups. Ari Shaffir was the podcast's first guest After some time on Justin.tv, Rogan suggested the idea of hosting a live video stream with Redban from his home and interact with fans in a chatroom and on Twitter, with the audio portion released as a downloadable podcast. Rogan was influenced by the open discussion style from appearing on Opie and Anthony and the live Ustream show that co-host Anthony Cumia did from his basement studio, Live from the Compound. The first episode aired live on December 24, 2009, which initially took the form of a weekly broadcast on Ustream, with the pair \\"sitting in front of laptops bullshitting\\". Much of the episode was dead air with the hosts figuring out the equipment. Early episodes featured an animated snowflake effect that was reintroduced on episode No. 674 in 2015 and episode No. 1,000 in 2017. The show developed with Rogan having friends as guests and having lengthy conversations; comedian Ari Shaffir was the first guest, who appeared on episode No. 3 on January 6, 2010. Rogan recalled that maintaining a consistent schedule early on was important in the podcast's growth, and it soon grew to two episodes a week. In May 2010, the podcast acquired its first sponsor in a partnership with the sex-toy production company Fleshlight. The company withdrew in mid-2012, when it claimed it had saturated its market. By August 2010, the podcast was formally named The Joe Rogan Experience, in an homage to The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and aired live several times a week. In May 2011, Rogan secured a deal with SiriusXM, a subscription-based satellite radio service, to have the podcast air on its uncensored talk channel The Virus. That year, Rogan said that the podcast was helping his stand-up comedy as he would take ideas that arose during conversations and develop them into routines. =YouTube era= In January 2013, video episodes of the podcast started to be uploaded onto YouTube under the account PowerfulJRE and episodes were surpassing almost two million views. Later in 2013, Redban started to reduce his time as the podcast's sole producer as Rogan had increased the number of podcasts each week, \\"and it got to the point where [Rogan] wanted to keep on going, six, seven hours\\" which became too much for him to handle alone. As a result, Jamie Vernon was hired as a second producer, initially to fill in as Redban's assistant, leaving Redban to produce roughly half of subsequent episodes. Vernon soon took over full time and Redban subsequently appeared on the podcast as a guest. Originally, the podcast was recorded at Rogan's home in California. From November 24, 2011, some episodes were recorded at the Ice House Comedy Club in Pasadena, California, also known as the Deathsquad Studios. Since November 27, 2012, the majority of episodes have been recorded in a private studio that Rogan acquired in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. The 1,000th episode aired on August 18, 2017, and featured comedians Joey Diaz and Tom Segura as guests. In April 2020, Rogan began having guests take an antibody test for Coronavirus disease 2019 before recording the podcast during the COVID-19 pandemic, although these tests are presently not FDA approved. Rogan uses a personalized, on-demand service that offers each test for $299. =Spotify era= On May 19, 2020, Rogan announced that from September 2020, The Joe Rogan Experience would be available on Spotify in an exclusive licensing deal worth an estimated $100 million. Under the terms of the agreement, full episodes will continue to be uploaded to YouTube until December 2020, when the podcast becomes exclusive to Spotify. The shorter clips of highlights from the podcast will continue to be uploaded to YouTube after the transition. Rogan ensured that the podcast will remain the same format, with Spotify not having any creative control. On the day following Rogan's announcement, Spotify shares increased by 7%. The move to Spotify coincided with Rogan's relocation from Los Angeles to Austin, Texas, and the debut of a new studio there.https://austonia.com/amp/joe-rogan-austin- texas-2646931875 The first new episode released on Spotify was No. 1,530 with comedian Duncan Trussell, which lasted for over five hours. On September 8, 2020, Rogan debuted his new studio on episode No. 1,533 with guest Adam Curry. After the podcast became available on Spotify on September 1, people reported on social media that episodes with more controversial or far-right guests, including Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Gavin McInnes, and Chris D'Elia, among others, were missing. Episodes featuring comedian and activist Tommy Chong, comedian Joey Diaz, and Mikhaila Peterson, daughter of Jordan Peterson, were also unavailable. VICE later reported that Spotify CEO Daniel Ek defended having episode No. 1,509 on the platform, which had Rogan and author and journalist Abigail Shrier discuss topics that some deemed transphobic, causing some Spotify employees to voice their concerns to management. A Spotify spokesperson said the episode was within its content guidelines. Rogan later clarified that the company had said nothing to him about plans to censor or editorialize the podcast, as some employees had suggested. He also pointed to the abundance of song lyrics hosted on Spotify that some would consider offensive. In October 2020, production of new episodes was put on hold for a week after Vernon tested positive for COVID-19. Rogan and the rest of the staff tested negative and will resume once they get the all clear from a doctor.  Guests  = Political candidates, figures and journalists = In 2019, Rogan hosted podcasts with three 2020 Democratic presidential candidates: Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang.

On June 20, 2019, Area 51 conspiracy theorist Bob Lazar made an appearance on the show where Rogan frequently discusses the possibility of aliens and extraterrestrial life. This episode was cited as the inspiration for the planned Facebook event and Internet meme known as \\"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us\\", created one week later. A study conducted by Coleman Insights in 2019 with 1,000 monthly podcast listeners aged 18 to 64 revealed that The Joe Rogan Experience ranked the highest in the \\"unaided awareness\\" category, double that of any other podcast. According to The New York Times, Rogan and The Joe Rogan Experience became an \\"unlikely political influencer\\" in the 2020 presidential election after presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard both saw measurable surges in popularity and fundraising after making guest appearances on the program in 2019, and in 2020, when presidential candidate Bernie Sanders saw a surge of press coverage in national news and global media outlets as a result of his campaign using a clip from The Joe Rogan Experience showing Rogan speaking favorably about the candidate and saying on air, \\"I think I'll probably vote for Bernie.\\"Joe Rogan Endorses Bernie Sanders by Matt Stevens, New York Times, January 24, 2020. On August 5, 2020, Rogan hosted a podcast with Dr. Debra Soh, who warns that many children who become interested in gender transitioning are being unduly influenced to do so, not only by their peers but also by parents and clinicians, who oftentimes do not consider that the interest may be a result of simple gender dysphoria or other developmental-psychological issues. This discussion prompted left-leaning watchdog Media Matters for America to call some of Soh's allegations \\"right- wing [lies]\\", including that minors are receiving transition surgeries, and further that this is being done without any clinical scrutiny or counseling. On September 8, 2020, President Donald Trump tweeted a clip from Rogan's interview with Mike Tyson, in which the boxer says hurting people can be \\"orgasmic\\". Later in the day, the president tweeted a clip in which Rogan jokes, \\"Biden, to me, is like having a flashlight with a dying battery and going for a long hike in the woods. It is not going to work out. It's not gonna make it.\\" On September 13, UFC fighter Tim Kennedy tweeted that, in Rogan's podcast with him two days earlier, the host had \\"offered to moderate a debate between [Biden] and [Trump] ... It would be four hours with no live audience. Just the two candidates, cameras, and their vision of how to move this country forward. Who wants this?\\" The next day, President Trump tweeted in reply, \\"I do!\\" This prompted Sunny Hostin of The View to denounce Rogan as \\"misogynistic, racist [and] homophobic\\" for allegedly having made insensitive comments at select times during his history as a podcast host.  Reception  The podcast has been described as \\"an important node of the intellectual dark web\\", and has featured a diverse ideological mixture of political guests including Democratic presidential candidates and conservative figures. In a more critical article for National Review, writer Theodore Kupfer wrote that the podcast, hosted by \\"A weed-smoking DMT-obsessive whose most cherished political cause is the quest to end male circumcision\\", has become \\"one of the last bastions for civil discussion in contemporary America\\".
